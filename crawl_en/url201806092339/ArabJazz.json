This peace is shattered when Ahmed Taroudant's melancholy daydreams are interrupted by the blood dripping from his upstairs neighbor's brutally mutilated corpse.The violent murder of Laura Vignole, and the pork joint placed next to her, set imaginations ablaze across the neighborhood, and Ahmed finds himself the prime suspect. However detectives Rachel Kupferstein and Jean Hamelot are not short of leads. What is the connection between a disbanded hip-hop group and the fiery extremist preachers that jostle in the streets for attention? And what is the mysterious new pill that is taking the district by storm?In this his debut novel, Karim Misk\u00e9 demonstrates a masterful control of setting, as he moves seamlessly between the sensual streets of Paris and the synagogues of New York to reveal the truth behind a horrifying crime. Ahmed Taroudant, a psychotic, French Arab man living in an apartment in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, who loves to daydream and read crime thrillers to escape from the harsh present and haunting past demons. One fine afternoon, he finds his beautiful neighbor, Laura, an air-hostess, murdered and badly mutilated in her apartment right above his. And that is when he realizes that he too was in love with Laura. But it is clear that whoever murdered Laura, has planned it well to put the blame on Ahmed. But in the eyes of the detectives, Rachel Kupferstein and Jean Hamelot, Ahmed is just a pawn. More digging into Laura's past brings up the buried secrets about Jehovah's witnesses, a religious hip-hop band making songs about Muslim Salafism movement, a drug named Godzwill, an old barber shop and the head quarter in Brooklyn . But what is that to do with Laura? Is she the victim of some extremist religious group? Read the book, which is translated by Sam Gordon from French to English.Sam Gordon did full justice to Karim Misk\u00e9's engrossing thriller. The book started bit slow with Ahmed buys books from Paul- a bookseller by weighing them in tonnes. The story began with Ahmed's narration who from the very first page came across as a man who is mentally disrupted, who loved to live in his uninterrupted dream world. The author vividly painted the picture of Paris where Muslims lived along with the Jews. He detailed the picture so intricately that you can almost smell the delicious food across the kosher and kebab shops and you can almost take a walk on the footpath of the cosmopolitan neighborhood in Paris. The prose is absolutely fantastic, yes sometimes it might be difficult to picture everything at a time from a hip-hop band preaching the Salafism, to the strict rules followed on being a Jehovah's witness to the making of a mysterious drug. The investigation is the best thing in the book with Jean and Rachel whose characters evolve as the story progresses. The characters are strongly built and are diverse. The author's writing is easy to understand and free-flowing enough to captivate our minds with the extreme religious disadvantages. The author even moves back and forth in time to reveal the mystery behind Laura's death from the head quarter of Jehovah's witness in New York to the current time with Ahmed, Rachel and Jean in Paris. But from the narrative, it sounded more like a literary fiction instead of a crime thriller. The mystery is not that well-captured, since the narratives turned out to be way too revealing. In short, a complicated novel that is easy to contemplate and easy to lose into. The name Arab Jazz is symbolized from James Ellroy's White Jazz novel and has nothing to do with jazz and we learn about it almost in the beginning when Rachel and Jean comes to investigate Laura's murder with Ahmed for the first time. Verdict:  Grab the book if you want to taste something different and twisted in the crime genre.

Indeed, the magazine even receives a brief mention in the novel, as does the controversial comedian Dieudonne.This is not the Paris of romance and history, but is firmly rooted in current events and reality \u2013 to be precise, the 19th arrondissement in a multi-cultural neighbourhood. Laura Vignole is an air stewardess for Air France and her murdered body is discovered by her downstairs neighbour, Ahmed Taroudant. The savage attack, along with a slab of pork, left on her table with a knife stabbed through it, leaves Ahmed in an awkward situation. He had a key for Laura\u2019s apartment as he watered her plants and it was well known that she was in love with him. As the main suspect, Ahmed decides he has to clear his name. This is easier said than done, as after a difficult childhood and a tragic event in his life, he has become a recluse \u2013venturing from his apartment only to stock up on mystery books. However, his sudden awareness that he has something to fight for, gives him a reason to live again. Of course, Ahmed is not the only person investigating the murder. Detectives Rachel Kupferstein and Jean Hemelot are charged with finding Laura\u2019s murder. This is not your usual crime novel and falls somewhere between a mystery and literary fiction. It asks some serious questions \u2013 why do some young men become alienated in the society they are living in and it also examines extreme religion and fundamentalism. This novel does not just look at Islam in this role though - the victim, Laura, had friends who were both muslim and Jewish and was herself from a strict family of Jehovah Witnesses. Rachel and Jean investigate what role the brothers of her friends had in what happened and this novel will take us from radical Islam, fundamentalist Christianity and radical Judaism and from mosques in Paris to the headquarters of the Jehovah Witnesses in New York. With multi-cultural tension, drugs and corruption in the police force, this novel looks at the extremes of religion and how it affects society. The characters are realistic, with Rachel Kupferstein and her partner Jean Hemelot, intelligent and caring, while the storyline has good pace. However, for me, the most interesting \u2013 and sympathetic \u2013 character was Ahmed. A sensitive and kind young man, his emerging from his book lined apartment onto the streets of Paris was brave indeed and you really want him to find a way to succeed and live again. Lastly, I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review."}, {"userName": "Raven", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5973984-raven", "userReview": "Sometimes, when reviewing books regularly there is an almost fixed template in your mind to construct your thoughts and feelings about a book. You provide an overview of the waxing and waning of a plot, the strength of the characterisation, the use of location and so on to formulate your critique. However, occasionally you are confronted with a book where you cannot resort to this more simplistic template, and even begin to question your own ability to find the words to describe your reading experience of the book in question. This is the dilemma I faced with Arab Jazz. So I will bumble on in my own sweet way- bear with me reader\u2026I read this book a few weeks ago immediately in the aftermath of the horrific events in Paris which stunned and shocked us all. Perhaps reading this book at such an apposite time provided me with a more visceral reaction to the book, but in hindsight, the strong messages that Miske conveys throughout the book regarding religious tolerance and intolerance are entirely in tune with the contemporary social tensions raised by religious difference. Casting its light on three secular groups, comprising of Muslims, Jews and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Miske provides a balanced and objective study of all three, impartially conveying to the reader the best and worst aspects of all and the protagonists linked to each. Instead, he succinctly reveals the human failings and frailties of each, the black shadow of fundamentalism, and the propensity for greed and violence no matter what faith or race defines you. The melting pot of characters, and the differing natures of their personal interactions form the very heart of this novel, across faiths, class, occupations and even continents (as the action pivots out to America) , thus transcending this book above any conventional tag of a \u2018crime novel\u2019, and leading us to the beating heart of a multicultural, multi-faith contemporary European city. In some ways this feels like a love letter to Miske\u2019s adopted city, powerfully illustrating the frustrations inherent in modern society, but by the same token, replete with a sense of the author\u2019s love for this complicated and multi-faceted city. It works beautifully when combined with the socio-political issues of the book, and our own newly formed perceptions of Parisian society.The central crime of the novel is the hook to add all of Miske\u2019s weightier issues on to, and works well with this in mind. With his two disparate police protagonists- both strong and engaging characters- the plot unfolds at a good pace, slowly inveigling the separate groups of characters that Miske introduces us to, with their singular ways of life and beliefs. The opening murder also gives the author the added scope to introduce a most tentative and heartfelt, albeit slightly stumbling, love affairs that I have ever read, that carries all the simplistic honesty of those great love affairs from classic fiction, and adds a residual warmth to the more weighty issues that Miske addresses.This is an intelligent, multi-layered and objective novel, that will make you think and increase your awareness of the differences that lay at the heart of any modern society. Aside from a few less fluid passages- perhaps slightly lost in translation- the book consistently flows in pace and plot. You will feel emotionally invested in the character\u2019s lives, and most importantly of all feel that you have read a book that deserves to be read. And if this one doesn\u2019t feature in my books of the year, I will eat my own foot. Possibly."}, {"userName": "Hanneke", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17944903-hanneke", "userReview": "What an enjoyable read this was! Very interesting setting in one of the multiculti arrondissements of Paris. A neighborhood where you are curious about, but never visit. This neighborhood is boiling over with resentments, fanatical religious zeal of any sort of denomination and small and bigger criminals, which makes up for a rather toxic mix. At the same time, it is a relief to read that it is possible to keep yourself aside from all the turmoil if you go about your own business and not pay attention. The story starts off immediately on page 1 when the body of a murdered Air France stewardess is found, a woman who was generally liked by all, including muslims, Hasidic Jews and non-believers. She lived above Ahmed, a reclusive guy with a sweet temper, whose apartment is so stacked up with detective novels that it is realistic to assume that he will not be able to walk around in a normal way in a year or two, the stacks being already three piles thick in width. Ahmed decides to shake off his lethargy, stop reading and try to find the murderer of his neighbor. He liked her and she was above all about the only person who he ever talked to. He becomes a very useful helper to the two police inspectors assigned to the case. The inspectors themselves have their own special little hang-ups and backgrounds and are very likeable characters. They follow the trail of former members of a hip-hop artists group, who turned religious purely out of love for provocation and who are following a self proclaimed converted psychotic nutcase, turned falafist preacher. It gets messy, especially when the trail also leads to Chasidic jews and vicious Jehova Witnesses. Sounds like a handfull of religious nuts? Well, it is!I thought the book is very well written and very funny at times. I really enjoyed to read a novel situated in one of those notorious arrondissements of Paris. You always wonder how life feels there, doesn\u2019t it. Well, now you can find out!"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27741289-julie", "userReview": "L'intrigue, un meurtre \u00e9voquant au premier abord des motifs religieux, n'est certes pas des plus originales mais plut\u00f4t d\u00e9licate \u00e0 traiter de nos jours sans faire pol\u00e9mique. Un pari r\u00e9ussi puisque ce fut une tr\u00e8s bonne lecture!Le style du r\u00e9cit est assez d\u00e9routant.

I want a good story, interesting situations, an intriguing atmosphere and consistent characters \u2013 I don\u2019t expect complex characters, just characters that are consistent and hold some sort of symbolic force. Arab Jazz seems to have been well liked in France and Sam Gordon\u2019s English translation got praise...at least there was a positive review in The Guardian. But I didn\u2019t really like it. In a way the story was ambitious, centred on a series of characters, police detectives, suspects, the culprits, it shifts through time, but I found it all a bit unfocussed. There is a murder and a detective narrative: there are the two central police detectives and Ahmed, a neighbour of the murder victim \u2013 but the other plot strands fill us in about what happened and the sense of mystery is destroyed: of course, there is no rule saying the novel has to have a central mystery, but I am not sure what Arab Jazz is doing. No, that\u2019s not true: it is fairly obvious that Karim Misk\u00e9 is exploring a number of themes, notably religious extremism. But I find it very heavy handed: there is an easy secular perspective, the religious extremists being depicted as inadequate and dangerous misfits, their extremism being a form of compensation for their failures \u2013 but I found it all a bit easy and a little smug, the author presuming the reader will share his secular perspectives. (But a difference between French and British culture is shown by the novel\u2019s depiction of the Jehovah Witnesses as a controlling and frightening cult, while in Britain the stereotype will more likely be that are strangely zealous, but largely harmless bores who try and lock us into religious conversation.) Arguably the police detectives and Ahmed are also misfits \u2013 but they are positive because they are secular misfits. And then there is a plot about drug smuggling and distribution...those behind it are either rejecting a religious background or still bound by one: there should be lots of interesting things here as parallels between the religious and the secular, the lawful and the unlawful are made, but the novel has no real way of dealing with them...other than implying a sort of religion is an opium analogy. And then there are themes around sex and violence, but I am not sure they do anything other than adding a bit of dubious titillation. If my description seems confused I think that is because I found the book very confused: it strived to deal with Big Themes, but it did so in crude ways. I know crime novels are often congratulated for dealing with Big Themes, but, for me, it feels as though the Big Themes are bolted to the generic conventions in a haphazard way. The review I read compared Arab Jazz to the film Pulp Fiction and there is a certain knowing self-referential aspect to the book in the constant nods to other crime novels and crime writers, but, whatever my doubts about Pulp Fiction, it has a certain playful wit about it, which was lacking in Arab Jazz."}, {"userName": "Antenna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11578910-antenna", "userReview": "After the Charlie Hebdo massacre, Karim Misk\u00e9 was praised for his prescience in portraying the dysfunctional immigrant youth of the 19th arrondissement in Paris who are prey to the kind of fundamentalist extremism of those responsible for the attack. In a January 2015 interview in The Independent, Misk\u00e9 comes across as a thoughtful and insightful man, \u201cArab Jazz\u201d has won prizes as a \u201cliterary\u201d detective thriller, and perhaps it is meant to be a parody of a corrupt, greedy society with distorted values, but I was very disappointed by this novel.Ahmed, an immigrant from North Africa, is addicted to violent thrillers as what seems like a counterproductive way of escaping from his traumatic past. As he sits reading on his balcony, drops of blood falling from above alert him to the brutal murder of his neighbour Laura who has shown him friendship. An air hostess who has severed links with her extremist Jehovah\u2019s witness parents, Laura has been the subject of what looks like a ritual killing involving pork for which Ahmed fears he will be framed. The ensuing revelation of the facts is due not to the investigative powers of the two young detectives who although described as intellectuals display absolutely no evidence of this, but rather to the author\u2019s tendency to indulge in lengthy, indigestible information dumps instead of making the effort to \u201cshow\u201d us any development of plot, character or motive.With its clunky, often implausible plot, two-dimensional characters, its crude stereotypes, relying far too much on psychotics, psychopathic policemen, and power-hungry, manipulative, hypocritical religious maniacs, its hammy violence alternating with corny sentimentality, and its amoral tastelessness and simplistic thinking without a trace of subtlety, \u201cArab Jazz\u201d is like a garish strip cartoon.

It's an ambitious novel, and I think Misk\u00e9 took so much on here that in the end the police procedural structure couldn't carry the weight, so some of the plot developments are purely functional, and some of the characters' dialogue of self-analysis far to freighted with meaning.

Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Jehovah's witnesses all live in close proximity to each other. Add corrupt police officers, rising tension between these groups, sociopolitical issues, oh and of course murder, then you have this engrossing gripping and all too realistic read.Ahmed Taroudant is a loner and a dreamer. He also has some mental health issues. Ahmed prefers to stay in his apartment daydreaming, reading poetry and crime novels. Until, that is, the day he finds his neighbour, Laura Vignole, savagely murdered in her apartment located directly above his. Enter detectives, Jean Hamelot and Rachel Kupferstein. The two detectives discover that Ahmed has a key to Rachel's flat, however they do not believe that he is their prime suspect, and this is where it's gets interesting. Ahmed, desperately wants to find the killer as he believes he has been set up to take the blame.The characters are vividly portrayed, and fully fleshed out. I really got a feel of who they were and how their life experiences had shaped their personalities. Of particular interest to me was Jean and the dark demons from his past. His, is an unsettling character that could certainly be developed and I would love to read more about him and the duo's adventures.Albeit a seriously prophetic, gritty crime thriller there are also some humorous moments for instance when a pair of killers are attempting to dispose of the body of one of their victims. It is perverse but also amusing.The pace is initially slow but progresses steadily into a riveting read that definitely held my interest throughout. The plot is uncomplicated but the relationships between the developing characters and their religious beliefs, and the unravelling of events were a little confusing. I compiled my own crime scene chart (in a note book, not a huge wall mounted one!) and had great satisfaction lining up the characters and their developing relationships to each other. There is a fair amount of data, and backfill information so this process was definitely beneficial to me in keeping pace as the story unfolded.The one niggle I had was the slightly 'Scooby Doo' mystery reveal at the end, but that's such a small niggle it's hardly worth noting, although I did detract a point on an otherwise 5/5 rating.I loved it and definitely recommend it to anyone interested in unusual crime noir with a twisted edginess.Karim Misk\u00e9 is a journalist and documentary maker and is born to a Mauritian Muslim father and a French Atheist Marxist mother. Arab Jazz is an exciting debut novel and I'm eager to see what he does next.Arab Jazz is translated from the original French into English by Sam Gordon.

A place where Islamists live alongside orthodox Jews. The two exist peacefully side by side, pretty much ignoring each other (except when some youths form a cross-cultural hip-hop group, or when \u2013 a little later in life \u2013 they join together in drug dealing activity\u2026).Laura, an Air France stewardess, is brutally and ritualistically murdered. The initial prime suspect is Ahmed, a mentally troubled individual, who lives in the apartment beneath hers. He has a key to her flat (and there was no forced entry) because he looks after her orchids when she is away on trips. But the investigating police officers \u2013 Rachel and her partner Jean (as in the French boy\u2019s name\u2026) \u2013 very quickly work out that he is harmless and incapable of the crime. He is determined to help them find the murderer, and quietly falls for Rachel in the process.The story proceeds at page-turning speed involving both corrupt policeman and very unpleasant Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. It is very well written and genuinely exciting. Misk\u00e9 has a real talent for exploring the multicultural nature of this part of Paris. He also writes about Brooklyn with authority. He himself, now a journalist and documentary maker, is born to a Mauritian Muslim father and a French Atheist Marxist mother\u2026 he clearly knows his subject matter extremely well. One of the areas he has covered is the common roots between Islam and Judaism. Arab Jazz is his first novel, and it bodes very well for the future. Rachel and Jean are the type of investigative police who will grow over time as we become more familiar with their modus operandi.All in all, Arab Jazz is a very worthwhile read that introduces us to a side of Paris that we might not normally come across. It is a gripping police thriller set against an enthralling background. It has won widespread recognition for Misk\u00e9 \u2013 including making him the winner of both the Grand Prix de Litt\u00e9rature Polici\u00e8re and the English Pen Award..

It's set in contemporary Paris, involves radicalised muslim youth and acts of terror, and it touches on drug dealing, mental illness and police corruption. Sadly, this is a disappointing read.The novel starts out well enough, with a depressed and isolated young man, Ahmed, discovering the murdered body of his upstairs neighbour, a young woman who had once been a Jehovah Witness. The crime scene is set up in order to implicate Ahmed but the two police officers assigned to the case immediately sense he's innocent. Soon, the police officers realise the crime points at local young men with extremist views.This promising set up is unfortunately torn apart by a sudden influx of all sorts of characters living in the neighbourhood -- from the victim's girlfriends to a dodgy barber -- who take away the focus of the story and any suspense surrounding the investigation. The narrative, intriguing to start with, gets bloated by all these characters - most who are just there as misplaced red herrings. Another problem with the novel is that Misk\u00e9 uses the third person omniscient point of view, giving us a look into the minds of all characters, including the murderer, and unfortunately diffuses all tension in the story. By the end, you couldn't care less who killed who, who survived, who went on a date with you. There are no surprises. You are left with the feeling that with a little more effort Misk\u00e9 could have turned this into a cracking read."}, {"userName": "Mish Middelmann", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8146550-mish-middelmann", "userReview": "Here's another way for France to address its diversity, instead of arresting women for wearing the hijab. Dark and a bit melodramatic, Arab Jazz finds evil in a wide range from Jehovah's Witnesses to Hasidic Jews, from revolutionary rebbe's to bent cops to revolutionary Islamists. The author digs insightfully into the yin-yang of great idealism and ugly depredation in pretty much all of his characters. He does this with a clear eye, speaking directly of matters of sex and drugs, family, identity and death. Yet at the same time the story has a dreamy quality - maybe because the stuff that is happening is so intense one needs a bit of dreaminess to cope with it. What I liked best about the book was the way he throws together such a diverse melting pot of different identities in a mostly-believable way. As the story plays out, the most extraordinary coalitions emerge - both amongst the goodies and the baddies - across the divides of gender, religion, age, sexual preference, politics and more."}, {"userName": "4cats", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4109510-4cats", "userReview": "After the violent murder of Laura Vignole, her neighbour Ahmed Taroudant finds himself at the centre of the murder investigation.

With our protagonist Ahmed Taroudant is both the one who discovers a grisly murder, but the primary suspect. Unfortunately for him, his personal relationship with the victim, Laura Vignole, his familiarity with her upstairs apartment, holding a key and the tone of a religious themed murder all raise questions. In this country that prided itself in secular equality, the cracks are starting to show, and the \u2018quiet communal neighborhood\u2019 is far less so. Misk\u00e9 uses Ahmed to discover these cracks and hidden (or perhaps not so hidden) prejudices, hatreds, frustrations and secrets even as the two detectives assigned to solve the murder are investigating him. What a series of twists and turns that bring forth issues that resonate today: the fear of different, religious intolerance and fundamentalist thinking, anger and frustration that create a pressure cooker of untapped and unrelieved pressure as the neighborhood begins to feel more like a containment rather than a part of the city. While I am convinced that there are nuances lost in the translation, and that moments of this debut author\u2019s prose wander off into thoughts and descriptions that are better left unsaid, the writing is purposeful and graceful. Each new character brings history, beliefs and personalities that intermingle in ways expected and not. Unearthing the dangers of fundamentalism, the effects of tolerance and it\u2019s lack, the basic denial of humanity and the essence of the individual within all of those competing elements all combine into a bubbling pot, allowing the resentments to form and grow. Ahmed is forced to confront his own beliefs, his place in society, Paris and France itself as the search for the murderer and their reasons are unearthed. Not an easy read by any means, there are complex issues lying in the pages of this book, with perspectives that are informative and quite revealing and thought-provoking.

The story starts with the protagonist, a young atheist Moroccan who lives as a shut-in loner in Paris' 19th arrondissement. He discovers the mutilated body of his upstairs neighbor and soon enough, a pair of detectives are on the scene. Their investigation leads them into the lives of a group of young neighborhood people: black, Arab, Orthodox Jewish, Salafist, and so on. Meanwhile, the protagonist starts to try and come out of his hermetic existence, going to therapy, and taking small steps to engage with the world. I was more or less on board with all of this, but all of a sudden the book starts adding flashbacks involving a completely new set of characters in Brooklyn (one of whom is a kind of rasta-Jew). To avoid spoilers I won't say more, except to say that this side of the story gets fairly preposterous. And when a simmering subplot involving corrupt Parisian police starts to come to a boil, I really felt like the book was completely off the rails. I read the final third just to see how it all played out, but was pretty disappointed on the whole. There's not a lot of nuance to how the religious extremists are depicted, and while I guess some of the setting might be intriguing for those who are only familiar with \"tourist\" Paris, the body count starts to get a but silly toward the end and the whole thing falls too far on the pulp side of fiction."}, {"userName": "Ann Tonks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51473275-ann-tonks", "userReview": "Some of the reviews below do this book much better justice than I can. It was completely mesmerising from the first chapter when one meets Ahmed Taroudant, the neighbour of the murder victim. It reads like a murder mystery but its focus is really on the tragic impact of religion - Islam, Judaism, Christianity - on young people. It paints a rich picture of multicultural Paris in the 21st century. An unusual piece of story telling - poetic and powerful. A hope there's more work by Karim Miske to come."}, {"userName": "Wendy Cosin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3401619-wendy-cosin", "userReview": "I found Arab Jazz intriguing at first - a murder mystery translated from French and set in primarily in Paris, with a diverse cast of characters: black, white, as well as Jewish and Muslim with varied levels of orthodoxy.The detectives were likable and reasonably-well developed, as was Ahmed, the psychotic neighbor who discovers the body at the beginning of the book. I liked how characters drifted into reverie in the middle of action, which let the reader get to know them better. However, when Jehovah's Witnesses, drugs, and sinister police got thrown into the mix, the story became too complicated. Toward the end, the author reverted to \"telling, not showing\" in a big way, which may have been the only way he could figure out how to tie together so many threads.
