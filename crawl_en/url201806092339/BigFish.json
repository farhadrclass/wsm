For me, it was pure visual and storytelling enjoyment. But what you may not realize is that BIG FISH the novel towers over the movie. When I first bought a copy of this, just before they began releasing the movie coast-to-coast in 2003, I remember reading the back cover and thinking to myself: \u201cHuh, a book about a man who doesn\u2019t really know who his father is\u2026how mundane.\u201d O, how silly my thoughts were\u2014this story is anything but mundane. This is a tragic story of not really knowing a father, but it is so much more. Let me explain. BIG FISH is a complex story about family, self, emotional certitude, and conflict between a son and father told through Tall Tales, snippets and allusions to the THE ODYSSEY and pinches of Joyce\u2019s ULYSSES. If that doesn\u2019t arouse some interest, you may be dead. The story is simple: Edward Bloom is dying, and his son, William Bloom, wants to know the truth of who his father really was as a person. But Edward is unwilling to give up anything easily, and William is determined to think that his father is an irresponsible liar that only told exaggerated stories of his own life.In an easygoing storytelling voice, William Bloom pieces together who is father was as a person, but, more importantly, he also pieces together who his father was a father. Through fantastic environments the reader is navigated through adventures both light and dark to the truth. Stories of giants and witches and obscure poets and lost towns and strange circuses allude to who, and what, Edward Bloom was. But, like most truths, ascertaining fact from fiction is a troublesome endeavor. I cannot think of a better story that exemplifies the strange relationship between a father and his son. Personally, I could relate to William\u2019s angst of not really knowing his father; and this personal relationship to the story made it all the more powerful. I mean, c\u2019mon, who really knows their parents? As children our parents are super heroes or villains, as teenagers they are a footnote in our lives. It is not until adulthood that we begin to understand that our parents had lives and dreams, fears and recourses or events that made them into the people they are. As a father myself, I am often caught wondering what my son and daughter will think of me as they grow older. What stories will be true? What ones will be fabrications of distorted memories? What imprints have I given them? In the end, does it matter? I can\u2019t say. But I hope they have stories of me that they will tell their children, as I have shared stories of my father to them.

The water was seeping through the ceiling of the hospital room and there was a dripping pan catching the falling raindrops beside my mama\u2019s bed. I was the youngest in the family and my papa did not bother to wait and see me right after I was born. I guess he was no longer excited to see another mouth to feed in addition to my two older brothers and a sister. Three days after my mama\u2019s caesarian operation, my papa picked us up but the streets were still flooded so we had to ride on a banca to cross the street and flag a jeepney a few blocks away from the hospital.30 years after.On the day my daughter (my only child) was born, I waited in front of the delivery room. I got nervous when the doctor went out the first time. She told me that my daughter seemed not to be bulging inside my wife\u2019s womb as if she was enjoying herself there. So, she had no choice but to do a CS and so I needed to sign a waiver. I signed it right away because I was excited and I forgot to even discuss the matter with my parents-in-law who were with me. The second time the doctor came out, my name was called. She handed me my daughter saying \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d I immediately carried my daughter in my arms and I noticed that her eyes were closed. I called her \u201cbaby\u201d and upon hearing my voice she opened her eyes and looked at me! I loved her since the first time I saw her. After a few seconds, she closed her eyes. Then the nurse approached us and gestured me to hand my daughter back. I did not want to. I wanted to bring my daughter home with me as if the initial bond was just formed magically and instantly between us that could never be broken forever.Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportion is a 1998 autobiographical novel by Daniel Wallace (born 1959). It is about an absentee father Edward Bloom who is a good provider but prefers to work away from home and a son Will Bloom who is facing the reality that his father is dying but he does not know him yet and even hates him for missed his growing up years. Edward is a joker and has a passion for storytelling. His stories are comic and full of fantasy elements. However, at the bottom of his heart, Edward Bloom only wanted to become a great man, i.e., \na big fish\n \u2013 to provide for his family and in the end get the nod of his only son \u2013 his approval.When do you say that a father is an absentee father? Traditionally, fathers are the primary provider in the family. We work to put food on the table, to send our children to school, to clothe them, to provide all the other necessities or sometimes once in a while, luxuries. Not all of us are fortunate to find work \u2013 some even prefer to maintain some distance like Edward - that would enable us to see our families at the end of each and every day. Many of us sacrifice not seeing our families as frequent as we wanted to just to fulfill our role of being good providers. Given that we sacrifice this longing to be with our family, do we still get tagged as absentee father. That\u2019s unfair.When I was growing up, there were times when my papa was in the city as he was a city policeman. When my daughter was growing up, there were times when I had to be away as I was doing systems implementation in other Asian countries. I missed the chance of watching her in several of her school affairs \u2013 family day where she danced on the field, a quiz bee on science fair when she was a contestant, etc. I regretted those but I had no choice as my work required me to be away. How do you then draw a line a between an absentee father and one who is only trying to keep a job to support a family? This book does not provide a direct answer but shows the effect of having an absentee father: the psychological longing of a son facing the father whose love he was wanting to feel all his growing up years.But this is not an all-out emotional book. It is not even a tearjerker. It is comic being peppered with funny jokes that can make you laugh out loud. I did in a couple of times. To those who have read this book, I laughed really loud on Edward\u2019s story about the man who loves his cat and also the one about Edward having the ability to predict who would die by dreaming about it the day before the person\u2019s death. Those two are really, really funny.I have seen the film but the book is definitely better."}, {"userName": "peiman-mir5 rezakhani", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2015", "userURL":

Once I started to read Wallace's novel, it became obvious why. The film was greatly padded out, using the material from the book as a backbone (the book reads more like a collection of concept notes for the film than a full novel). The film also made several changes in Edward Bloom's character (making him more likeable), for example, in the novel, it is confirmed that Bloom did have an affair, where the film had the woman deny that there was any infidelity (despite her attempts to seduce him). Wallace's choppy, flitting style, like flicking distractedly through various TV channels all showing different episodes of the same vast biography, also makes it hard to foster a bond with any of the characters and therefore hard to care about any of their exploits, not matter how spectacular.

I watched the movie many years ago, and liked it (albeit I now only have very vague memories of it). The film adaptation diverged in some ways from the book, while still keeping the core concepts, concepts I enjoyed both watching and reading about. This story is about a son coming to terms with the inevitable death of his sick father\u2014as well as trying to come to terms with the 'mythic' life of the same man and trying to make sense of who exactly is his father.It's a testament to the book's writing that despite me ultimately disliking the father, I was still wholly interested and invested in the father-son relationship, that I could even understand the sort of strained, frustrated affection the son had for this flawed man who was so difficult to reach out to. It's what I'd consider a fairly terse book, with the narration of the father's life being straightforward and brief, with that charming, whimsical Southern voice used, while the present-day portions with the son dealing with his sick father would take their time, languishing, stretching the contemporary prose to meet with the difficulty of impending death, an impending deadline of how long the son has before he loses his chance to finally connect to this difficult old man. The ambiguous ending was also very stirring, in my opinion\u2014do we take it at face value and accept the 'mythic proportions' the father achieves, or do we choose to read between the lines and imagine that this might be the son's way of coping with his father's death and how much (or how little) he really knew him? Either way, if nothing else, this book makes me want to watch the movie again, and that's not a bad thing at all."}, {"userName": "Shovelmonkey1", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3926982-shovelmonkey1", "userReview": "Edward Bloom is dying. But he's taking his time about it. Time enough, in fact, to have four run ups to the actual event itself and to recount the varied adventures, myths and fables which have attached themselves to the Bloom name since not long after he was born. For son, William Bloom, having a legend for a father is not easy. Firstly it's a lot to live up to but, there's also the problem that no one knows where the fairy tale that is Edward Bloom's history ends and the reality begins.Edward Bloom always felt himself to be a big fish in a small pond and he was determined that one day he would swim away from his small town and see the wider world and he'd make a name for himself and no mistake about it. From small town sporting hero to giant tamer; from reclaimer of magic eyes to dog-vanquisher; from gallant knight to real estate mogul; from myth to father figure. Who is the real Edward Bloom? This story presents itself as a charming fairy tale for the modern age but really it is an examination of the father-son bond as two people who are closely linked but worlds apart reconcile themselves with their imminent separation brought about by death. In doing so William Bloom is forced to ask himself how well we really can know our parents? Will they ever be real people or will they always be shrouded in the cocooning layer off tall tales and heroics which we applied to them as children?A fluffy family orientated read which will leave you with a centre gooey-er than a truck load of Cadbury's Caramels."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jessica", "userReview": "3.5 stars.

Since I\u2019m working on a story that has a dreamy, fabulist writing style, I wanted to read something similar, and Big Fish certainly fits that description with passages like this: They say he never forgot a name or a face or your favorite color, and that by his twelfth year he knew everybody in his home town by the sound their shoes made when they walked. They say he grew so tall so quickly that for a time\u2014months? the better part of a year?\u2014he was confined to his bed because the calcification of his bones could not keep up with his height\u2019s ambition, so that when he tried to stand he was like a dangling vine and would fall to the floor in a heap.However, there is no story here. Nothing really changes, and the characters are only vehicles for weirdness. In the author interview at the end of my edition, Wallace admits that the dying father narrative was only added in to impose some kind of traditional structure. Still, it\u2019s that real-world component that gives the book meaning, revealing themes of emotionally distant fathers and self-mythologizing. A reviewer, in reference to the Big Fish movie adaptation, said, \u201cA well-told lie illuminates the truth in far better clarity than a simple recitation of the facts ever can.\u201d Given this idea, I somewhat expected the fantasy scenes in this book to have real-world equivalents, like in Neal Shusterman\u2019s Challenger Deep, but any parallels are most likely coincidental rather than intentional. For example, in one of the earlier scenes, Edward Bloom attempts to leave his hometown but instead ends up in a sort of purgatory. You get the sense that all the townspeople in this middle place are stuck in stasis after having failed to achieve the big dreams they once had. The desire for escapism is also evident throughout the story, namely in how Bloom wanted to elevate his own importance in the eyes of others by always playing hero. Humans are social beings, and it\u2019s a fairly universal feeling to want to be remembered as \u201cbig fish,\u201d to be interesting and accomplished and well-liked.The strangeness of Big Fish also made me question some of my own assumptions about storytelling. Do stories need to have a \u201cpoint\u201d? Do they have any obligation to teach us lessons or reaffirm our values? What is it that we so love about the conventional three-act narrative?I was fascinated by the quotes on the author\u2019s Wikipedia page as well. He has said of his past writing endeavors that \u201cThe pure pleasure of invention, of making stuff up, clouded over everything else. I couldn\u2019t tell the difference between a good story and a good story told well.\u201d I also related to his feelings about the magic of words appearing on the page: \u201cI write things I didn\u2019t know I was capable of writing, and sometimes that feels like magic. It isn\u2019t; it\u2019s just me.\u201d Wallace\u2019s general attitudes toward the craft provide insight into his writing process, which seems to be purely improvisational. Big Fish reads like freewriting with zero preplanning, the author\u2019s subconscious ideas somehow floating to the forefront. \nThe Bottom Line:\n Despite the story\u2019s utter lack of forward momentum, the short chapters and vibrant prose made this an enjoyable read; I think writers can learn a great deal from how Wallace constructs a sentence."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16316375-elaine", "userReview": "My introduction to Big Fish was through the movie over 12 yrs ago. I really enjoyed it. I remembered it as a fun and sort of lighthearted tale with an underbelly of serious lessons to be learned. While I am not a big fan of fairy tales I do enjoy folk tales. I grew up listening to my very southern grandfather tell me how he rigged up matchboxes full of dirt for large beetles to pull and how he \"shot a bear off a horse\". I am no stranger to a \"whopper\". When being told a whopper your job as the listener is not to question the story. Your job is to imagine these wonderful tales and laugh and beg for more!This lyrical story pulled me right in. Each chapter is an individual tale all coming together to paint the picture that was Edward Blooms extraordinary life. Some of the \"chapters\" weren't even a whole page while others where much longer. The writing was easy to follow and I have no complaints in that regard.A sort of doom and gloom hung over the book. As the story progressed it became pretty depressing and I liked Edward less and less as a character. However, the books main focus seemed to revolve around the relationship between a child and a parent. Edwards son narrates the novel telling the reader about the life his father lead, a life of mythic proportions. As the reader you literally observe a child, and not a child necessarily only in age, leaving behind the idealized view of a parent. In this regard the author succeeded immensely. I was reminded of Go Set A Watchman. Towards the end of the novel Scout is told that as a young child she confused her father with God and the failings she currently sees in her father where always there if she had just looked. In Big Fish we are told about the perception of Edward Bloom, not the reality. The way EVERYONE saw Edward, not the way he was. I haven't read much in the way of magical realism so I hope I'm using the term correctly when I say this book isn't exactly what it appears to be. As the reader you are required to peel back the curtain and look beyond what is being presented. Otherwise you're getting a small collection of folk tales revolving around a single character.In the end I went with 3.5 stars but rounded up to 4. I didn't dislike the book. I found the message slightly depressing and was left with a feeling of sadness upon my completion of the book. I enjoyed the stories and I know I will be thinking of this book often."}, {"userName": "Xueting", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4691420-xueting", "userReview": "I had the great fortune and pleasure to have Daniel Wallace as my Intro to Fiction writing professor this spring at Chapel Hill. He was thoughtful, funny and most of all very sweet to all of us in the class. And I could feel his sentimental kinda old soul in the words of this book. So the story is made up of vignettes or short stories, the structure has a 'purpose' that I don't know how to capture without sounding too flimsy-fantastic, and fantasy's not all it is. To me it's important not just to decide what we (the reader) believe in in the stories and why, but also to realise that the decision is basically the question of the kind of 'truth' each belief creates. And Daniel Wallace connects the magical bits to the more obviously and fully real-life bits, while leaving little overlaps so we can make our own decision how they connect. I loved some of the little vignettes more than others, and the last one was probably my favourite. Some of the stories did feel disjointed and, to be honest, cliched or over-hyperbolised in a not so pleasant way, but still those flaws made me think about the flaws of our memory-making processes and how they added some unexpected sentimentality to the story when I think about who's telling the story, and now I realise I think about the storyteller point-of-view a lot as I read the book...

While I ended up liking the book well enough I have to admit that I absolutely adore the movie. There are quite a few differences between the book and the movie, but I'd say the changes are to the film's advantage. Overall, though, I think the film has the tone and the spirit of the story, but it's presented in more of a linear fashion. Plus, the coda from the film gives the viewer a little peek at the truth behind the myth of Edward Bloom, whereas the book leaves us to make up your mind with multiple versions of the ending.

Not so, me. I\u2019m a bit more laissez faire in these matters. I saw and thoroughly enjoyed Tim Burton\u2019s 2003 adaptation of Big Fish, and didn\u2019t think too much more about it. Fast forward a decade, and I hear that a major, Broadway-bound musical is on the way. Now I know it\u2019s time to return to the source material.In the past, it has occurred to me that I have an overdeveloped sense of whimsy. I\u2019m a middle-aged woman, for God\u2019s sake. But I love this sort of light, heart-warming, and above all whimsical tale. Daniel Wallace\u2019s debut novel charmed my socks right off! It is, first and foremost, a tale of paternal and filial love. The brief novel is told through the eyes of son William as he watches\u2014four separate times\u2014his father Edward dying. It doesn\u2019t sound like an upper, I know, but Edward Bloom is a larger-than-life character.All his life, Edward was a teller of jokes and tall tales. He\u2019s the sort of character who charms everyone around him. And yet, as much as his father has always made him laugh, William feels that all the jokes and stories have kept him at arm\u2019s length, and that he\u2019s never really gotten to know his father. Now in these final hours, he seeks a deeper connection\u2014all while a greatest hits montage of tall tales recounts Edward\u2019s extraordinary, eventful, and one might even say mythic, life. Edward confesses to his son, \u201cI wanted to be a great man\u2026 Can you believe it? I thought it was my destiny. A big fish in a big pond.\u201d Later William acknowledges, \u201cHe\u2019s just being him, something he can\u2019t not be. Beneath one fa\u00e7ade there\u2019s another fa\u00e7ade, and another. And beneath that, the aching dark place, his life.\u201d By the end, however, each man gets what it is he needs:\u201cHis illness was his ticket to a better place. I know this now. Still, it was the best thing that could have happened to us, this final journey. Well, maybe not the best thing, but a good thing, all things considered. \u201cIn Wallace\u2019s novel, it\u2019s the journey, not the destination. The folksy fables that make up Edward\u2019s life are as colorful and imaginative as anything you could wish for, and full of humor. And Daniel Wallace\u2019s narrative voice is distinctive, as well as distinctly Southern. He has a wonderful, playful way with language, as with this passage: \u201cThis is what is meant by last words. They are keys to unlock the afterlife. They\u2019re not last words, but passwords, and as soon as they are spoken you can go.\u201d While Edward is more legend than man, it is William who is the emotional core of the novel. He\u2019s what keeps the story grounded and creates resonance with readers. Everyone knows what it is to love (and feel frustrated by) a parent, and so the emotion William experiences is universal.This was a fantastic introduction (15 years late) to a new novelist. I can\u2019t wait for a chance to see the musical! It will be magical on the stage. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve seen the film, but Burton did a lovely adaptation. Many of the stories from the novel are recreated faithfully. Others are altered or created from scratch in the same voice. I was delighted to discover in the book passages that never made it into the film as well. Commenting on adaptation on his blog, Wallace noted that Big Fish was now a book, a movie, and a musical. He offered one final adaptation. Big Fish, the haiku:He hides behind liesand charm.

Every single human being has stories to be told which in fact belong to us as a part of our life , but everyone of Edward's stories told by his son William forms a \"novel of mythic proportions\" as the title suggests. Persuading giants, helping people, taming wild dogs and other heroic acts, William thinks that he does not really know who his father is, just only through these fantastic and extraordinary legends. But what William wants is to see his real father and what his feelings and thoughts are. Also, the version of Pinocchio in flesh and blood (William) knows that this could be the last chance to sort this mistery out or maybe William has to accept Edward just the way he is.From my perspective, this story is very moving and emotional. It is really well-thought out and well-written. It is dramatic and funny at the same time. Finally, I'd like to say that I really like the part of the story in which William and Edward are talking about religion and Edward answers him through a joke about Jesus and Pinocchio. From my point of view, the moral of this joke is really important and meaningful that is: his son is the best thing he did in his life."}, {"userName": "Arghavan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7531404-arghavan", "userReview": "\u0648\u0631\u0698\u0646\u0650 \u062a\u06cc\u0645 \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0646 \u0634 \u0631\u0648 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u200c\u062a\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0645. \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc\u0650 \u0627\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0631\u0648 \u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0647\u200c\u062a\u0631 \u0646\u0634\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0628\u0648\u062f\u061b \u0648 \u06cc\u0647 \u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0632\u0648\u062f\u0650 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0632\u0648\u062f \u0645\u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f \u0646\u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0628\u0648\u062f\u061b \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0628\u062e\u0634\u0650 \u062e\u0648\u062f\u0634\u0648\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u06a9 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0634\u06cc\u062f\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u0628\u062e\u0634\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0647. \u0648 \u062e\u0628 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0632\u06cc\u200c\u062a\u0631 \u0648 \u06a9\u06cc\u0648\u062a\u200c\u062a\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u061b \u0636\u0645\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u0648 \u062e\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u0648\u0642\u062a \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u0636\u0645\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633\u0627\u064b \u062a\u06cc\u0645 \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0646 \u062e\u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a.\u0627\u06cc\u0646\u060c \u06cc\u0647 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u0635\u0644\u200c\u0647\u0627\u0634 \u06af\u0633\u0633\u062a\u0647\u200c\u062a\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f. \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0632\u06cc\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0639\u0640\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0650 \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645\u060c \u062a\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u0641\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u062a\u0634\u0628\u06cc\u0647\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a. \u0641\u0636\u0627 \u0631\u0648 \u06cc\u0647 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a\u06cc\u06a9\u200c\u062a\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0628\u0648\u062f \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u0641\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0632\u06cc\u0650 \u062a\u06cc\u0645\u200c\u0628\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0646\u06cc. \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u064b \u062f\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0639\u0650 \u062e\u0648\u062f\u0634 \u062e\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u0645. \u0647\u0631\u0686\u0646\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u0650 \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062a\u0648\u0646\u0645 \u0628\u06af\u0645 \u0627\u06af\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u0648 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0646\u0650 \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645\u200c\u0634 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0645\u060c \u0628\u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0645 \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u0631\u0648 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u200c\u062a\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0645\u061b \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0628. \u0686\u06cc\u0632\u0650 \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u0645.\u0648 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0631\u0627\u0636\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0645\u061f.. \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0645\u061b \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0627\u0631\u0650 \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0647\u200c\u0627\u06cc \u0647\u0645 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0645 \u062e\u06cc\u0644\u06cc. \u0686\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062a\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u06cc\u0650 \u062a\u06cc\u0645 \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u0648 \u0628\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0627\u064b\u061f! :\u06cc"}, {"userName": "Sanja_Sanjalica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8096368-sanja-sanjalica", "userReview": "4.5Interesting, sweet, well written.
