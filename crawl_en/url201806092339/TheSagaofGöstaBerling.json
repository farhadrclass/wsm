I do not mourn for \"simpler\" times in as pigeonholed a way as those of an aged nostalgia, for a smaller view of things does not inherently lead to less amounts of cruelty, or an increase in understanding. What I mourn for is what I have interpreted of the bits and pieces left to me, the music, the literature, the sense of Far over the misty mountains cold that raises hairs no matter how many may puke over technology and newfangled young'uns and their contemporary times. So I got Stravinsky's Firebird Suite through a Disney cartoon instead of a radio or concert hall or whatever is 'legitimate' and 'enculturated' these days. Big whoop. I'd pay attention if I heard \"white supremacy\" or \"morality that must be babysat is no morality at all\", but alas. I do not mourn for these times like one supposedly must, and thus must figure it out on my own.\nFriends and children, dancing or laughing! I want to warn you to dance with care and laugh softly, for if your shoes should step on an oversensitive nature rather than on hard boards, it can cause an enormous amount of suffering; and your strong laughter can drive a soul to desperation.\nOne nice result of having set myself on all the Big and Difficult Things is that I can compare millenium old Japanese classics to Nineteenth Century Nobel Prize Winning Literature without any and all daring a peep, so I will go ahead and say Lagerl\u00f6f successfully pulls a Genji. Sure, I like G\u00f6sta Berling a hell of a lot more than Shikibu's titular soul, but that doesn't mean he's more of a main point than he is a particularly effective fictional device. Where he goes, we go, and enjoy what comes. What he does, we view from all sides, and appreciate the need for life and sociocultural norms. Whom we meets, we embody, and it is never so simple to say what we mean with love and alcohol on one side and the stability of civilization on the other. Deals with the devil never looked better when one thinks on how humanity's run the world thus far.\nThose who were wiser could console themselves that they had fought for their country and for honor. What did he know of such things? He simply felt that he was hateful because he had killed and caused much injury.\nCourse, any work of this breed of creation and beyond is nothing more than a compilation of fictional devices, so let's do what some are pleased by and others are pissed off by (sometimes both, depending on the lies they are defending and the truths they are denying) and compare literature to math. Into our formula troops G\u00f6sta Berling, twelve guests, one major's wife, one heiress, one beauty, one devotee, one countess, the landscape of Selma Lagerl\u00f6f's childhood, the history of her riches and the future of her downfall, religion as the hardbound moral work it was meant to be, cultural heritage as it is meant to awe in equal measure, and that 'good' so fought over by pagans and Christianity and whoever else has a hard time with raisons d'\u00eatre. It's beneficial to know something of the place and the times, but sagas of events that may have been a downfall, may have been a triumph, may have been a scandal and may have been a time of holiness have played out the world over, so too much knowledge of the nonfictional sort may cloud more than it conceals.\nYou ought to know that no one can worship the goddess of wisdom without some punishment.\nBeyond that, the differences between the two previously mentioned works of classical status and male-webbed plotlines lie in a matter of worlds, insular Heian court versus sprawling V\u00e4rmland woods, the latter of more instinctive appeal to my Euro-bred self for its ice, its mythos, the joys of its industry and the hells of its souls. My mind is most comfortable in sidelong conjuring when the woods are dark and the air is fog and the depths of evil are wandering the roads at will, so those to whom Dracula appeals for glimpsed landscapes and Kristin Lavransdatter calls for the bitter glory of moral triumph, come. This one's happier than either and is best read aloud, even to music if one is of mind.\nMy reward would be enough if the poor would remember me for a year or two after my death. I should have done some good if I had planted a couple of apple trees in the yard or taught the country fiddlers some of the old tunes or taught the shepherd children a few good songs to sing in the woods.\nThe afterword's a mewling twit of a thing penned by someone who cannot believe a woman wrote this work, so find your Lagerl\u00f6f bio elsewhere. You do not need theological nitpicking, nor erratic Euro-patriarchal namedropping, nor even a few final begrudging lines about experimental literature and life that are ruined by being couched in whines of \"feminine in the best sense\" and the like. You may, however, need the work. It's something I'd hedge my bets on even if 'twere wrote in blood on black and rang of ghostly bells, deep in the misty nights.\nDear reader, must I say the same? The great bees of imagination have now swarmed about us for one year and one day; but how are they going to squeeze into the beehive of fact is a problem they will have to solve by themselves."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "[Bettie's BooksThe rating, any status updates, and those bookshelves, indicate my feelings for this book.

This may just be evidence of my personal ignorance, but I suspect she doesn\u2019t have that much name recognition in the English-speaking world generally, despite the fact that many of her books have long been available in English translation (in the case of G\u00f6sta Berling's Saga, since 1894.)G\u00f6sta Berling\u2019s Saga was Lagerl\u00f6f\u2019s debut novel, published when she was in her early 30s in 1891. It is a strikingly original and distinctive work, to the point that I find it difficult to think of real parallels for it in other literatures with which I am familiar. I occasionally thought of Kasua Ishiguru\u2019s The Buried Giant as I was reading it; and, rather more often, of James Hogg\u2019s The Three Perils of Man. G\u00f6sta Berling\u2019s Saga rivals both for eccentricity, which is really quite an achievement. Like The Buried Giant, it has a strange, slow-build, layered quality, as well. At points along the way, the suspicion grew on me that it was completely bonkers, but, by the end, I found it a powerful and impressively sophisticated work.G\u00f6sta Berling\u2019s Saga is set in Lagerl\u00f6f\u2019s native province of V\u00e4rmland, in western Sweden, a land\u2014as Lagerl\u00f6f lyrically describes it\u2014of wolf and bear-haunted forests, bright lakes, and mines rich in ore. The novel draws richly on the legends and folk tales of the area, in a way that gives it a texture reminiscent of magic realism. The devil gets a bit-part appearance, as does a slinky and dangerous wood nymph, and the whole saga has a swoony, mythic, fabulist quality to it. There are echoes of the Faust myth, with the selling of souls, and of Don Juan in the reckless dissipation and scattergun seductions of the title character, a defrocked priest. For all the magic, though, the realism is never quite forgotten. History lurks on the margins. The characters include a few relics from the Napoleonic Wars, and a fascinating, barely-there political theme seems perceptible at points. The exuberant, laughter-loving Countess M\u00e4rta, seems to embody the gaiety and whimsy of the ancien r\u00e9gime at her first appearance, but she quickly morphs into a tyrant. One striking set-piece scene shows a popular uprising against the hedonistic r\u00e9gime of the \u201ccavaliers of Ekeby\u201d (I\u2019m not going to even attempt to explain that reference), in a human explosion of violence that parallels the equally striking scenes of flood and fire we find elsewhere. The introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of this novel has some interesting material on its early reception. Some of it illustrates very well what Lagerl\u00f6f had to struggle against. The Danish critic Georg Brandes, who seems to have been responsible for \u201cdiscovering\u201d the novel, nonetheless speaks patronizingly of Lagerl\u00f6f as a na\u00efve novelist (\u201cher warm, living imagination is like a child\u2019s. Exactly like a child\u2019s.\u201d) That seems extraordinarily misguided. Lagerl\u00f6f\u2019s narratorial voice, which is one of the glories of this novel, takes on the naivety of the folk-tale narrator at points, but only as part of a complex and articulated strategy. This is anything but a child-like work.One excellent piece of trivia from the Penguin introduction: in addition to her literary talents, Lagerl\u00f6f also proved herself an efficient businesswoman, with a line of \u201csuper-healthy oatmeal, labeled M\u00e4rbacka Oats-Power.\u201d So that was her secret!"}, {"userName": "Orient", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43587353-orient", "userReview": "It was hard for me to judge the translation without knowing the book in the original. That's why I have to look at it as to any other book. And, what do I find:1. effortlessly gloomy plot (some gothical spices to Scandinavia)2. some black humour (hardly enough to change the situation to better)3. mexican soap opera (Gosta, \"the lord of love\", the sinful former priest, wanders full of self-pity and gay (yep the biggest part of this book is overflooded with this word so beware, this word is infectious :D) through the hearts of the women and sometimes the lands and forests.)4. Unnatural characters. It's sad that I found nothing, even not a little bit, naturalistic about the characters in the book. All I could feel was that most characters were too much exagerated. Maybe the translator did an awful job or maybe it's just the maner of the author.Once I got accustomed to the style (how masochistic it sounds ;D) and the peculiarities -the whole experience is not so REALLY bad. I really liked the description of the nature and some jokes. Those are the small gold pieces that I found digging through all the crap.This book is a real monument to the comic absurdity of human behaviour.Ah and the best sentence is:\"Now it's a matter of life and death,\" cries Anna, an early love of Gosta's, as their sleigh is surrounded by wolves, \"howling with hunger and blood-thirst\", and she wonders if travellers the next day will find their \"torn-apart limbs on the trampled, bloody snow\". It's no country for cowards or weaklings. \"This was life,\" Anna thinks, \"rushing along over sparkling snow, defying wild animals and people.\"I think it clearly shows the real rebellion through the rough-tough life."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1133758-adam", "userReview": "Are the new caretakers of Ekeby twelve worthless drunks or twelve worthy, heroic figures fallen on hard times? By the novel's end, both possibilities seem true, and their leader is the most complicated of all the men--a young defrocked minister and lady's man named Gosta Berling. The men have made a contract with the devil in human form and have been granted the run of the Ekeby estate for a full year. Over the course of the year, Gosta experiences epic love no less than three times, and every month or so a great tragedy or miracle occurs in the region.Selma Lagerlof's deft blending, in 1891, of neo-Romanticism and quasi-saga storytelling is endlessly entertaining. I read the book in multiple sittings over the course of a few weeks, and this may have been the ideal way to take it in since, structurally, it often has the feel of those great English installment-chapter novels of the Victorian era. Lagerlof often begins a chapter as though it were a short story, starting from some unpredictable launching point and gradually cementing This Tale into the greater myth-work that is Gosta's saga. As with all the Lagerlof I've read, a great exuberance of heart and humanism predominates. Though when she addresses tragedy she is always convincing, I can't believe that Lagerlof ever sat down with the desire to evoke gravitas or melancholy in her audience; all her writing seems to have been crafted with the idea of its being a gift to the reader, something to lighten our cares and kindle our imaginations. That this book is not generally known as a classic of Western literature is a shame."}, {"userName": "dely", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4579103-dely", "userReview": "I didn't enjoy that much this book. The beginning was interesting and I thought that the book would have talked about G\u00f6sta Berling, a disavowed priest, and his adventures. It talked about him, but the whole story wasn't flowing: every chapter was a kind of short story. I may say that the book is made by many episodes with several characters, all equalliy important though G\u00f6sta Berling is the \"gravity center\". So some chapters are dedicated to G\u00f6sta's friends and these chapters didn't add anything to the story or the plot.I also couldn't understand if G\u00f6sta Berling is a character of Swedish folktales or if those were stories the author had listened to as a child or if there is something real but with some magic added (witches etc.) or if it's only a piece of fiction.The author perhaps wanted to add also some moral teachings? There is good vs evil but at the same time every character is both good and evil. Sadly this analysis is pretty cold, there aren't shades, so the characters don't seem real. The author underlines that sometimes bad can be done involuntarily and that bad things sometimes happen so that we can learn from it and improve as a person, but it isn't put well in the story and so sometimes I had the feeling to listen to a puerile moral teaching. Towards the end there were also too many religious concepts that I really couldn't stand. An example: who is the cause of a drought? A priest is the culprit because he was stingy and wasn't able to pray God as he should and so God punished the people with a drought. Meh.As said, the characters don't seem real because some of their behaviors go from \"very bad\" to \"too good\" and often I had the feeling they were crazy. There are some very good descriptions of the place and of the landscape, but sometimes the author becomes too aulic and solem so I didn't like these parts because it's a way of writing I don't like."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/711637-erin", "userReview": "How Strikingly Beautiful He Was: A Review of Gosta Berling's Saga\tThe Varmland of Gosta Berling's Saga made me crave a word that would be in all ways synonymous with the word \"exotic\" except that the word I want would replace connotations of south tinged with oriental with connotations of north tinged with occidental. I'm not sure what exact location Western Culture can be given but it seems reasonable to posit that if it could be pinpointed Varmland would fall far enough north of there to qualify as a northern version of exotic in terms of farawayness, otherness, and unfamiliarity. (Especially when one takes into consideration that the word exotic didn't always mean so very faraway---sometimes it could be found as close as the mediterranean which would surely be equidistant to Sweden if only the location of Western culture could be pinpointed somewhere.) In Varmland there are wolves instead of tigers, dark forests instead of jungles, and glistening snowdrifts instead of tropical flowers.\tExotic lands produce romantic heros (blame it on the climate, as Lagerlof in regard to her land and hero) and so Varmland produces Gosta Berling. \"How tall and slight and how strikingly beautiful he was! In helmet and a coat of mail he might have stood for an ancient Athenian. He had the unfathomable eyes of a poet, but the whole lower part of his face was that of a conquerer, his whole being was instinct with genius and refinement and warm poetic feeling...\" Too bad the young pastor's fine instincts led him to drink and he abandoned his parish to wander the land as a beggar. A man of such refinement can't just slink off into the forest to die however so he ends up living a life of leisure at Ekeby Manor. In the course of his ensuing adventures with the Ekeby cavaliers he is tricked into betraying the trust of the Mistress of Ekeby and he and the cavaliers are put in charge of the manor and several iron mines as well. They continue making merry, there is a flood and famine, unrest among the peasants, Gosta falls in and out of love, there are parties, girls try to kill themselves over him and occasionally succeed until finally Gosta marries. Then they all live happily ever after. Except for the ones who died.\tThe Saga of Gosta Berling is both a romantic recounting of the adventures of a carefree young man as well as the story of that man's perdition and salvation. Throughout the course of the book he slowly begins to realize that all his dash and daring does more harm than good and he ends up wanting to steal away to the forest to do as he did at the outset of his adventures. Instead his wife finds him and admonishes:\t\"I say to you that you should simply go and do your duty. You must not dream of having been sent by God---everybody is that, you know. You must do the work without heroics. You are not to dazzle and astonish people; you must do it so that your name is not too often on people's lips.\"\tThe problem with the story is that by the end Gosta's salvation doesn't really seem to be worth much. Selma Lagerlof is so enamored of her hero that she indulges him at every turn. She can't help writing scenes in which he brings ruin or even death to those around him because those scenes are integral to his character (or lack thereof) and are keeping with the story of the sinner saved. At the same time she constantly inserts lighter scenes of dancing and carousing and Gosta's charming antics which I assume are meant to show how lovable he is but instead make him seem spoiled and thoughtless. Every time he commits a blunder that brings ruination to someone else she explains that it was not really, not exactly his fault. Her descriptions of his good looks are oppressive in contrast with his deeds and cannot achieve their intended purpose of making the reader adore him as much as the author does.\tYet there are some powerful characters in this book. Margarita Samzelius, the capable Mistress of Ekeby, formerly the lovely Margarita Celsing is one, and Captain Lennert, God's pilgrim is another. The story of the Mistress of Ekeby who is betrayed by Gosta and her faithful cavaliers and cast out of her home as a beggar brings a more interesting redemption story into the narrative. Where Gosta is blithe and passive she is vigorous and active. She did not lead a blameless life but when she was confronted with her past failings she sought rectify them, and even beforehand she made herself useful to those around her. After being cast out of her home she seeks the forgiveness of her ancient mother and then returns to Ekeby to die. Captain Lennert was a playful man on his way home from prison after being convicted of a crime when he did not commit. Unfortunately he came across Gosta and his cohorts who coerced him to drink and then painted his face while he slept so that the first his long suffering wife saw of him was the face of a hopeless drunkard. She cast him out and he became an itinerant preacher wandering the countryside and doing what he could to help the peasants during the famine. He was killed defending a woman and child in a brawl at the fairground. Gosta was indirectly the cause of the circumstances that led to each of their deaths, each of which leaves the book feeling a little lighter, and we are left with a living Gosta, whose life, in comparison, loses some luster. \tThe bulk of the book is taken up with chronicles of Gosta's failed romances. He falls in love with countless girls it never works: one was too innocent to know he was a defrocked pastor and when she finds out she kills herself, one was a cold beauty whose heart did not melt sufficiently for Gosta, another fell in love with him as they sped over a frozen lake in a sledge but when wolves began to pursue them they were forced to make a detour to the house of the man she was promised to and there Gosta leaves her. During that fateful sledge ride Gosta throws a copy of Corinne into the mouth of one of the wolves. I've never Mme. de Stael (though I suppose someday I'll have to---she's mentioned so frequently) but I have heard that she was writer of great sensibility and I think it is unfair of Lagerlof to treat her so harshly when she is trucking in the same sort of stuff. Especially in the moment when Corinne is so unceremoniously disposed of. (\"It is you I love---you, the noblest of men. You need do nothing, be nothing, you are born a king.\" The poet's blood in him surged. She was so enchanting in her love, he clasped her in his arms.\" That seems like enough mush to choke a wolf.)\tThe problem with exoticism is that it is often used to mask a lack of substance. I will not say that Gosta Berling's saga is devoid of substance, but rather the substance is left fallow in the summer fields of Varmland while Gosta and his friends are out carousing. It is as if the author herself was in love with Gosta Berling and blind to all of his faults. She neglects the better parts of her novel to follow him. She introduces him to us expecting us to be as smitten as she is but Gosta Berling is definitely not my type."}, {"userName": "Hymerka", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2017", "userURL":

She often let the reader determine the driving force behind her story, and this was long before paranormal literature became the huge genre it is today.

They seem almost crude at first. My Penguin translation of 2011 seems to struggle to describe this work, and I do too. \u2018Sweeping historical epic\u2019, in the book description, won\u2019t do for this interweave of stories, and if, like me, you look askance at the \u2018string of women who fall under G\u00f6sta's spell\u2019, you may, like me, yet be glad you pursued your curiosity nevertheless. The back of my book even sells it as \u2018the Swedish Gone With the Wind\u2019. Plot fiends who expect a Gone With the Wind \u2018sweep\u2019 are likely to be frustrated with these short episodes that focus on different people; and while the majority of tales have to do with love, they don\u2019t add up to a grand romance. Rather they give viewpoints \u2013 women\u2019s and men\u2019s, sad, ecstatic, cynical or idealistic \u2013 and often operate with irony. Trust Lagerl\u00f6f. First woman to win the Nobel. Lived as a lesbian (with a fellow writer) but the literary establishment presented her as a maiden aunt who told charming fairy tales. On the ways she had to let them \u2018present\u2019 her and her work, see this article: \u2018Selma Lagerl\u00f6f: Surface and Depth\u2019.http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/01...The eponymous hero is more an excuse to spin tales with, his counterweight being \u2018the majoress\u2019, in whom the author probably situates herself. There is psychological portrayal; it just does not reside in the \u2018hero\u2019. At times it resides in imagery, in the construction of the brief plots, or of course in whichever from the cast of persons steps forward for a particular tale. The book is notable for personifications, of animals and of an animist landscape. A bravura one is a flood, whose waters have their opportunity to wreak vengeance on humankind. Typically, this tale becomes diverted: another crosses its path and we follow that one instead; I never heard what happened with the flood. Often you hear, though, as if by chance interconnection in another tale.

Probably it is, but one should probably be somewhat suspicious when a Swedish author received a Nobel Prize, awarded by a Swedish committee consisting of privileged academics. I grew up hearing about this book, and, coincidentally, my grandmother came from V\u00e4rmland, the setting of the book. For decades I had ignored this work so its time had come\u2014or so I thought. Well, as it turned out, I should have resisted longer.This is not a novel. I was put off by the chopped-up texture of its presentation. \u2018G\u00f6sta Berling\u2019 is a work consisting of artful meanderings. Lagerl\u00f6f was a literary conjurer. She had great skill with forming phrases and sentences that enchant and charm the reader. And she often goes off-topic to add incidentals. Considerable time is taken to inform the reader about flora and fauna, local customs and the social dynamics of V\u00e4rmland. Intervals are used to delve into fantasy and mythology. We share in the reminiscences of horses and even the wagons that they have pulled. We follow the fancies of an eagle on an excursion. Miss Lagerl\u00f6f was notably enamoured by her character Berling, a shifty defrocked priest, a drunkard and Don Juan. His relationships with women can best be described as whimsical, impulsive and disloyal, even reckless. The author injects a number of other characters\u2014especially headstrong women\u2014to act as accomplices or adversaries (sometimes both) to his egocentric foibles. The women\u2019s\u2019 emotional investments in G\u00f6sta are most often absurdly paradoxical from one moment to the next\u2014from slavishly worshipful to heartlessly dismissive. I very seldom give up on a book. Many books are not exactly gripping or entertaining from page one. Most take a few dozen pages to get the reader interested. My expectations were high for this book but it failed to engage me. With stubborn persistence I plodded through more than half of it before I decided I had had enough. I am sure my dispassionate grandmother, although a contemporary of the author, had no time for such enigmatic literary fare. By today\u2019s standards I think \u2018silly\u2019 would be an apt word to describe the plot of this trumped-up literary work which may have fascinated readers by its non-conventionality a century ago."}, {"userName": "Virtuella", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2333997-virtuella", "userReview": "One of the most charming and intriguing books that I've read in a long time. Not exactly a novel, rather a collection of (sometimes closely, sometimes loosely) linked short stories; I've never seen anything quite like it. I loved the ambivalence of it, floating between folk tale and family anecdote, and how sometimes a later story would throw a different light on something that was said earlier. I enjoyed how various characters took centre stage in turn and appeared later as minor players in someone else's story. Narrator's voice is beautifully balanced and subtle. The result of Lagerl\u00f6f's technique is profoundly convincing portrait of a community, or rather of how a community appears in retrospect to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the protagonists."}, {"userName": "Katy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy", "userReview": "An interesting collection of stories of people in a region in Sweden.

The book begins with Gosta Berling being defrocked as a minister due to him being a drunkard. The book continues with a succession of chapters, which constitute more a series of short stories than the narrative of a novel, all about the characters in the remote Swedish locale in which this defrocked minister lives. All these characters wind up going to invariably gloomy fates, these gloomy fates being brought about by their own apparently endless stupidity.

Very well written, although I am sure the original Swedish edition is much more flowing and wonderful. To the point, the author really pulls me in with her poetic language and then crafts in a rather thoughtful story within that. Lagerl\u00f6f has the perfect ratio of dialogue to description, and I can see her bringing these words to life in some quiet study with the light on at midnight. She seems to take pieces from her own life and age and work them into the pages with unparalleled skill, and I feel like learning more about her life so I can truly see the connections involved. Occasionally, there are small stretches where she narrates, and tells of this tale in her own \"words\" relating to her own life (if that makes any sense).One of the things I really like about this novel is the almost magical, surreal feeling linked to it and the partial-realism. It is like a river, flowing with shining bits and pieces that swiftly drift by before one can fish them out. Magical realism is exactly what this is the precursor to, and I can definitely see Lagerl\u00f6f dreaming and allowing her mind to paint across the pages with their imagery and thought. Such care and originality!Swedish culture is fantastic! Lagerl\u00f6f describes the realm of nature vividly and carefully, making me question her connection with the realm of nature as well as the Scandinavian/European connection\u2026 I wish our modern society had a better view of nature and a correlation with it. This book is eventful, full of natural curiosities, and it emphasizes the power that natural things have over human control. To be honest, the love connections happening in this book interested me less than the nature descriptions of the river and icy landscapes. I think that is what I favor most about Lagerl\u00f6f's writing: the connection to nature.This tale twists down the basement stairs into complete cold and bitterness from previous times of joy and light at quite a few points. Many characters have icy minds of stone with no regard to the innocence of the young, and are deceptive and manipulative as well as selfish and greedy. What\u2019s most interesting about this is that one can tell that Lagerl\u00f6f has developed the characters from young and heartfelt souls to older, more understanding, steadfast individuals. She demonstrates how people can take their anger out on others and how one\u2019s history can manipulate one\u2019s personality. An author who can do this is evidently skilled and their writing is clearly of high quality.However, this book is also a calming and thoughtful tale of love. It is sad, warming, emotional; human qualities cannot escape the power of love and its curiosities. In fact, love can twist the way one sees the world in either a negative or positive way. One stays young inside with age, and time changes the way we see relationships. Truly, what are decisions? What is time, and what is life? One's position evolves over time, but some things always stay the same. Many of the chapters in this book go off on separate tangents, but somehow Lagerl\u00f6f manages to subtly weave them together.In addition, Lagerl\u00f6f uses history within a novel of magical realism. She puts forward the cultural clash in regards to religion while spinning the webs of a magical tale. The story is soft and gradual, thoughtful and harsh. How does the author meld these? There is something about the nature, the landscape, the setting that all contribute to this soft and bumpy texture of delicious pages. Real-life topics AND efficient, beautiful tales of wonder and desire.Towards the end of the book, I began to see a religious tone to everything. I got a feeling of God and a large discussion surrounding him. It twisted away from stories and love and shifted towards a ramble about God, which very clearly shows that the author must have been strictly religious. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She was weaving the tale so well and with ease, with thought and power and real life situations of romance and greed... yet it went downhill. All it became was the ghost of a story with a huge emphasis on God and his ways. Though I greatly enjoyed the mystical nature of the writing, the author began to repeat sequences which made the flavor die a little. Overall, a book that seemed to go up and down quite a bit. With review of the tale\u2019s good moments in comparison with the bad ones, and the reality-based tones within a magical-realism background, the novel pans out to a solid 4.5 stars.4.5/5"}, {"userName": "Ebbs", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65539308-ebbs", "userReview": "This book is a very slow read, but so worth it!"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246350-susan", "userReview": "Selma Lagerlof was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for literature so I have always been curious about her work but had never given it the time it deserved. The Saga of Gosta Berling one of her most well known works is an unexpected surprise-a series of morality tales with a heavy dose of magic realism.The reader follows Gosta Berling a defrocked Minister-he leaves due to his requiring alcohol to avoid the poverty and starkness of his position to being saved by the Majoress and becoming one of 12 Cavaliers at a wealthy country estate-Ekeby. Most of the cavaliers had been soldiers during the Napoleonic wars and provide various interludes interspersed in the narrative of Gosta\u2019s life and loves.Evil makes its presence known early on when the cavaliers believe that their Savior the Majoress is actually in league with the devil and gives up the soul of her 13th cavalier each year. The cavaliers sign a blood oath against the Majoress requiring her removal from Ekeby and placing them and Gosta in charge for a year.Lagerlof interweaves tales such as Wolves snapping at the heels, sinister woodlands, sloth and avarice to guide Gosta and the cavaliers through their year of being in charge. What I liked most about the book was that her use of magic realism adds rather than detracts from the narrative giving the reader a clear picture of a complex scenario much like a fairy tale."}, {"userName": "Aldo Marchioni", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32709649-aldo-marchioni", "userReview": "At first, I had an impression of a book for children, written in a childish style. My impression was, if I had grandchildren, I could read this book at bedtime.However, as the reading was progressing, maybe I was getting used to the style, maybe the subject of the tales that, put together, make the novel, were growing more \"adult\", I felt in love whit this book.All the time it is in somewhere between reality, fantasy, magic, fairy tale ... Some hundred years later, somebody invented the expression \"magic realism\" to address a certain way to mix magic with reality in a natural way. Selma Lagerlof mastered the magic realism one hundred years before One Hundred Years of Solitude: but how evocative she is, and everything from this book smells clean, clear, fragrant, even when it is about some maleficent witch or even when death is evoked (\"Death, my pale friend ...\": the meeting with death reminded me The Seventh Seal, the film by Bergman: and it is not a surprise Ingmar Bergman was Swedish, and for sure he knew, and very likely loved, this book).I have read the last chapters sitting in a forest, partly by choice, partly because the day was hot.

I had high expectations on this novel and they were met from the first pages. I admit it was harder to understand that it is a fictional book with a fictional story (what am I talking... most books are fictional). This author really has a strong imagination! The novel can be regarded as well as a collection of short stories connected between them. It is also hard to fit this work into a certain genre, it has romance, fantasy, magic even surrealism, mysticism. It is places in a mythical time that seem to be eternal, although there are references of the early 19'th century. The narration style is a \"knight tale\", intentionally old fashioned I guess.It takes me quite a while to understand that this story doesn't conclude anything, doesn't have some logic/realistic thread. There is also a strong christian vein in all the narration and the ending also represent some sort of an epiphany for the main character, Gosta who finally finds redemption.An original and interesting book that left me with a warm feeling."}, {"userName": "Conny", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39067790-conny", "userReview": "\"Die Saga von G\u00f6sta Berling\" (1891) ist eine Zusammenstellung vieler kurzer, chronologisch zusammenh\u00e4ngender Geschichten, die in den 1820er Jahren in V\u00e4rmland spielen.
