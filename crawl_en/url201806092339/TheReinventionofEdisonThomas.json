The story opens with Eddy, as he prefers to be called, at his school's science fair. Quickly, the reader learns that Eddy is not your typical middle schooler. He knows the scientific names of what seems like everything as well as recites the elements on the periodic table to calm himself. Each chapter also contains facts from the \"Random Access Memory of Edison Thomas\" which are unusual facts that connect in some manner with the chapter. The random facts were probably one of my favorite things in the book. When Eddy comes in third in the Science Fair and he cannot imagine how he did not win first place. Even though his third place win has secured him a spot as an alternate to the Regional Science Fair, he is extremely disappointed. At school the next day, Eddy discovers that the crossing guard for the elementary and middle school is losing his job due to budget cuts. This greatly upsets Eddy and he decides to apply his skills as an inventor to coming up with a way to alert cars to slow down thus preventing potential disasters. As I read through the story of Eddy, I found myself really becoming quite enamored by this quirky student and his friends particularly Justin, an academically gifted student that befriends him. Houtman does a remarkable job at portraying Eddy, who likely has Asperger's Syndrome though this is never specifically identified in the story. She captures Eddy's struggle to understand facial expressions, deal with sensory information, and social situations. This is often showcased through both his misunderstanding of the actions of one of the popular students who seems to enjoy ridiculing Eddy, and in his lack of responses to the social initiations of several other students. The story has a satisfying ending as Eddy learns many lessons about friendship, standing up for himself, and even what he may have in common with Thomas Edison. When I read a book that is intended for middle grade readers (grades 4th to 7th), I attempt to read the story in two ways. First, how will students in these grade levels receive the book. Who is the story geared for and will the specific audience be attracted to it? Next, I think about how the story may or may not be used in a classroom, or be a resource to parents and teachers. On the first point, I believe that students particularly on the upper age range of middle grade readers are the ones who will best relate to Eddy. This is in part due to the vast amount of scientific references and language in the story. Some younger readers may be overwhelmed by the vocabulary. However, since bullying and struggling with friendships is very much part of the school experience for most children, all readers will relate well to this element of the story. Second, as an adult reader and educator, I can see the story being used to discuss issues regarding social struggles, differences, and finding solutions to your problems. All in all, I think this is an enjoyable debut novel by Jacqueline Houtman. I look forward to sharing Eddy's story with students and teachers as well."}, {"userName": "Angie Fehl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl", "userReview": "Middle grader Eddy Thomas is a science geek and inventor. He likes to dumpster dive for spare parts to make these inventions. His favorite band is They Might Be Giants because their lyrics incorporate actual science. He doesn't like people touching him and he hates loud noises. He recites the Periodic Table of Elements whenever he feels himself getting scared or anxious about anything. Some might call the kid \"quirky\". His uniqueness ends up making him a target for a lot of bullying. Surprisingly, the bulk of the tormenting comes from Mitch, who was once good friends with Eddy when they were just a few years old. But as they got older, Mitch seemed to put more value on being considered popular than a good friend. Strange thing is, everyone sees Mitch's behavior towards Eddy for what it is except Eddy himself. While I don't think it's said outright, the descriptions of Eddy's behavior suggest that he likely has Asperger's Syndrome. He admits that reading facial expressions is incredibly difficult for him and sarcasm is usually lost on him. He instinctively wants to take everything at face value, so he can't understand why Mitch could wish ill-will towards him when they've known each other so long. What else can they be except friends? But over the course of the story, Eddy develops new friendships with people who show him what true, healthy friendships should consist of. This story is geared toward the middle-grade reading age and while it might not be the cup of tea of any reader of that age, I think it will highly appeal to those who love science, trivia, fun facts, that kind of thing. The scenes in this novel are broken up by facts from Eddy's memory, which he cutely refers to as his RAM or Random Access Memory (computer joke /reference). I personally really enjoyed Eddy's sense of humor. Though Eddy says he doesn't \"get\" sarcasm, he's actually pretty good at self-deprecation!One of the moments that cracked me up most was when Eddy was working on a history assignment where he was asked to write a biographical essay on an important historical figure. Well, nearly everyone in Eddy's family is named after famous Thomas's and as you might have guessed, Eddy's namesake is none other than the inventor Thomas Edison. While Eddy initially prefers to choose someone else to write about, time crunch concerns cause him to go with the easy pick. As he reads about Edison though, he finds he and his namesake actually had a good bit in common. What unsettles him is Edison's propensity for fires unexpectedly starting around his work. Eddy makes the observation that for a guy who accidentally started so many fires, it's a wonder he was not the inventor of smoke detectors or fire extinguishers!While I couldn't help but cringe at the bullying traps Eddy unwittingly walks into, I had to cheer when he comes to a point of embracing who he is, quirks and all. It's beautiful when anyone of any age gets to have that moment in life! :-)"}, {"userName": "Sarah BT", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2438338-sarah-bt", "userReview": "Although it's never mentioned in the book, I would guess that Eddy would be a student who is somewhere along the autism spectrum. He has difficulties deciphering social clues, he doesn't like loud noises or crowds, and he is very smart when it comes to science and know lots of random facts in various scientific subjects. I thought Ms. Houtman did a great job making the reader understand what it was like for Eddy-why he didn't like crowds, how some things were more difficult to process. There is a lot of scientific information as well and there were parts of it I found distracting. Eddy mentions the Latin names of animals, food, etc. and it was somewhat jarring at first. There's also little breaks in the story that include various scientific facts that were somewhat related to the happenings in the book, but served more as a quick fact and something interesting to learn. Because of all that, I think the book may have a limited audience. As I was reading, I wasn't really sure what tween or young teen reader I would give this book to. But there's a reader for every book. While the audience for this one may be small, I met a couple of young teens during my school visits last week who said they love science and I think they would enjoy this book. I would be interested to see how a student like Eddy, who sometimes has trouble with abstract concepts, would handle this book. Because I felt the author did a great job with Eddy and explaining things, I think this might be a rare book that readers on the autism spectrum that often have trouble with books being too abstract would have an easier time with. I also really liked the plot line of Eddy standing up for himself to the bullies and discovering what made a true friend, although I wished it could have been developed a bit more. This one would be good for tweens or younger teens-especially if you have readers who always gravitate towards non-fiction and never try fiction. There's a nice mix of both in this one that's it's sure to please."}, {"userName": "Emilee", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2710558-emilee", "userReview": "I am giving away an ARC copy and featuring this book all week long on my blog: http://penultimatepage.com/eddy-week-...My Thoughts:I\u2019m going to start this out by saying that The Reinvention of Edison Thomas (we\u2019ll call it EDDY) is not a book I would typically pick up of my own accord. However, I am pleased to be able to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.EDDY is all about the characters. Jacqueline signed my copy with the quote \u201cnot all great minds think alike\u201d and that really resonates throughout the entire story.Eddy, our main character, is different from the other students at his middle school. What he lacks in social skills he overcompensates for in book smarts. Eddy can build intricate alarm systems that gently wake him up while at the same time feed his fish, yet he can\u2019t seem to figure out that Mitch, one of his oldest friends, has turned into a bully and focused his attention on Eddy.Eddy is constantly growing throughout the story. Into himself, into new friendships, even into his name. I was constantly cheering him on, wanting to pat him on the back, or shaking my head at him. He pulled every emotion from me. This, to me, is a fabulously written character.The plot of EDDY is unique, to say the least. The story of Eddy\u2019s growth is infused with inventions, special effects, and binomial nomenclature. To help us further perceive Eddy, Jacqueline includes \u201cRandom Facts\u201d that Eddy remembers off the top of his head that pertain to whatever the situation. Whether it be about Lapis lazuli or ostrich eggs, this element introduces something completely unique and engaging to the book.I would recommend EDDY to any lover of middle grade books or science. This is definitely something I would pick up for a little brother but am glad I read myself.The Verdict:A fast, fun, intelligent read, EDDY is an emotion-stirring book that is definitely worth your time."}, {"userName": "Erik This Kid Reviews Books", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7532583-erik-this-kid-reviews-books", "userReview": "Eddy is a kid with autism who is super-smart, but has trouble understanding other people. It makes it hard for him to make friends. At first Eddy didn\u2019t want to be associated with the name Thomas Edison (Eddy\u2019s name is Edison Thomas) but after doing a school research project on Edison, Eddy figures out they have a lot in common. Eddy is a genius and can invent all sorts of things from scraps of machines he finds. Eddy enters the school science fair and is sure he will win, but he comes in third. After he was disappointed at the science fair, sticky notes with mean messages like \u201cGEEK\u201d and \u201cNERD\u201d appear on his locker. Someone also put a mean sign on his back during the science fair. Eddy is being bullied and he doesn\u2019t know who to call a friend anymore. Justin, who came in 2nd at the science fair tells Eddy that the boy Eddy thinks of as a friend, Mitch, is the one leaving the mean messages and bullying him. Eddy doesn\u2019t know who to trust and if Mitch is the one being a bully, Eddy wonders if he can have friends.One of the reasons I really like this book is that it is told from the POV of a kid with autism. I thought the character of Eddy was very believable and gave me some information of how a person with autism thinks. I like how the book points out that Eddy is super-smart and shows that just because someone has a \u201clearning disability\u201d, it doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t be geniuses. It also shows how Eddy is very kind and a good person with awesome inventing abilities. I am also glad Eddy finds out who his true friends are. I really like the added RAMs (Random Access Memory [Of Edison Thomas]) that are here and there in the book. They are little facts that pop up here and there to show some of the things Eddy is thinking. I learned some interesting stuff from them (like that platypuses are poisonous). I think books like this one are very important for kids to read.**NOTE - I got a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Jessie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7427100-jessie", "userReview": "Usually, I don't read book with boy main characters because they are rather boring, but this book is one of many that have started to change my mind. I loved that there was an actual purpose to this story, as apposed to some nail-polish fluff you might find in other middle grade fiction these days. I really, really, REALLY liked the science aspect, I was able to learn so much! (24 chicken eggs=1 ostrich egg?!?!?!) One of the great things about this book is how Ms. Houtman makes science really funny. Not farce, like most science authors, but subtle, punny stuff that makes just the right tone. Characters. For this genre bracket, they were detailed just fine. Middle grade characters are not supposed to come off as Shakespearean figures, after all. I think Edison was a great character, and I got REALLY mad at the principle with the catsup incident, which is not unlike something that happened to me when I was in first grade. The one character that annoyed me was Tiffany. Guidance counselors in general don't have a clue, but she takes the cake for ineffective. Okay, she gives Eddy some relaxation techniques. Other than that... does she really help Eddy? No. Like others, I suspected that Eddy had a learning disabillity, but no one really tried to help him. I've known a lot of kids that had learning difficulties, and so I can relate to how they feel and see how teachers can be completely impossible like the ones in this book. So, to sum up my long winded rant, the characters were VERY realistic. Not my favorite style, but worth it. I cannot wait to read more from this author."}, {"userName": "Carol Baldwin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/912370-carol-baldwin", "userReview": "Edison Thomas is a boy genius with a problem. Here is the opening:\"\ufeffEddy sat on the steps outside Drayton Middle School, where the noise from the science fair in the gym still roared in his head. Tiffany always told him to picture a calm place when he felt stressed....Tiffany's strategy wasn't working; his heart was still beating too fast. His body would have to be under control for him to go back into that gym full of people...New calming strategy: think about the science fair project.\" The author, Jacqueline Houtman, has begun to paint a picture of a middle school boy who has Asperger's syndrome. Eddy has a million scientific facts at his fingertips but is unable to relate socially to his peers and is happy in his own world of experiments and science. The book is full of personal conflicts: disappointment when his science fair project does not win first prize, not understanding why his former friend Mitch now teases him, and obsessive fears over children being killed when a crossing guard loses his job. Two turning points occur that change things for Eddy. When he figures out how to stand up to Mitch's bullying and when he accepts the friendship of two other scientifically-minded peers, Eddy's life begins to change.

The story begins when Eddy is at his school science fair and is overwhelmed by the mass amounts of noise in the gymnasium. The story goes through Eddy\u2019s calming methods, and engages readers in the mindset of children struggling with Asperger\u2019s. Eddy is a likeable character who is picked on and bullied more now that he and his peers are in middle school. The plotline is surrounded by Eddy\u2019s love of science and facts, and when Eddy\u2019s school crossing guard is let go, the reader witnesses Eddy put his worry to good use, when he develops a traffic signal. All in all, this book is not only entertaining and helpful in helping students understand the \u201codd\u201d kid in school, but is also informational as there are facts and information on Autism and Asperger\u2019s in the back.

How could he not have won? Eddy suffers from autism and to some he seems very strange. He has trouble in crowds and with loud noises. He is socially out of touch. What I mean is when the school bully picks on him he doesn't understand he is being picked on. With a head full of scientific facts he tends to ignore those who are interested in the things he is interested in and trying to be a true friend. It takes one persistent person to show Eddy who his true friends are, what friendship is and how to stand up to Mitch the bully. He learns that sometimes change is good. I found this book to be very realistic. As a middle school teacher I run across people like Mitch and Edison. It has been my pleasure to work the few autistic kids that have crossed my path.

This one is about an autistic middle-school boy, Edison, who is really into inventing gadgets. As smart as he is about mechanics, he has no social skills and has trouble reading emotions on other's faces. He is clueless that the school bully has targeted him, but thinks the boy is actually being friendly. Edison falls for his pranks until a brainy geek befriends him and sets him straight about the bully. Despite his tactlessness, Edison makes two other friends who seem to appreciate his quirkiness and in the end, he finally recognizes what he has and appreciates his friends. This book was a quick, fun read. It seemed total not based on reality--more like a fairy tale of how we would like middle-schoolers to act toward kids that are different--but it is an enjoyable dream.
