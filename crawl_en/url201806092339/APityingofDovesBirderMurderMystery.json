This second installment feels more solid, now that the stage is set and the main characters have been introduced. I like the main character, Domenic Jejeune, despite the fact that he is difficult to get to know, maybe even because he is elusive.This is another muddy mystery, quite literally as a van has to be hauled out of a marsh. The landscape of Norfolk is very much a character in these books and I\u2019m glad that I have visited there and can picture some of the locations quite clearly. (This could also be an excuse to go back, of course, and reacquaint myself with this lovely birdy part of the world, for as Jejeune notes, birders do like to retrace their steps). Of course the case hinges on the doves of the title\u2014but in an intelligent way, not just a kitschy way. Burrows delves into real conservation issues to provide the clues for his detective. I was fooled for a little while, thinking thoughts about Passenger Pigeons and cloning, a red herring which I am pretty sure Burrows intended. If he didn\u2019t, it worked anyway!I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a birder out there who hasn\u2019t wondered at some point whether s/he could turn the hobby into a source of income. We all flirt with the idea of how wonderful it would be to escape our current employment treadmill to spend every day in the field. Jejeune may be a fabulous detective who can\u2019t shut his mind off just because his superior asks him to, but he longs for a change in vocation. Obviously, since there is a third book, he hasn\u2019t found an escape just yet! That is also typical\u2014field work doesn\u2019t pay very well and being a tour leader has its own kind of drudgery.Secondary characters are asserting themselves a bit more this time around, and Jejeune\u2019s relationship with Lindy assumes greater importance. Is she going to be able to stick with this quiet, obsessed man for the long haul? (Any of us who have dated birder men frequently ask ourselves the same question). A solid second book, recommended for those who enjoy both mysteries and birding."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5809296-helen", "userReview": "There is more internal dialogue in these stories than you usually get in mysteries. You hear from everyone, too, not just one person and you have to remain alert when the narrator shifts. The characters are good, although when the author has to tell you on every third page how brilliant the detective is one has to wonder. I like Domenic Jejeune and think he is very lucky to have two great interests in his life. He's also very lucky to have Lindy.The stories are written with bird conservation in mind but you don't have to be a birder to enjoy these portrayals of Norfolk. The Norfolk tourist board should pay Mr. Burrows a subsidy for the work he is doing because is descriptions make the county almost irresistible to a traveler. I searched for Sorocco doves and European turtledoves and discovered that the Sorocco dove is a quite beautiful bird with a fluffy orangey breast, quite different from the turtledoves which are somewhat like rock doves with the the blue and grey bars changed to shades of brown it appears. From the pictures you couldn't mistake one for the other.We so often think of \"our\" birds, the ones we see, but forget that the birds who disappear during winter do not dig homes in river mud but have a second home in some other country and conservation has to involve those second homes as well.

What drilled it home to me that somewhere in this creation an artificial intelligence was prompting some of the narrative was the repetitive nature of some of the character development. Danny Maik, the closest thing to a partner our lead detective Domenic JeJeune has, likes Motown. How do we know, because it is referenced over and over and over, sometimes incongruously as in when it is brought up at a work meeting. I imagine a popup window that jumps into place when Maik\u2019s name comes up in a new chapter with a reminder to deepen the character by mentioning his love of Motown. Did we mention he loves Motown? How about some Stevie Wonder lyrics? Frankly, it drove me nuts.Other character development is just plain weird. Holland is made of the flimsiest cardboard\u2014why does he exist? It is already clear that JeJeune is not in sync with his colleagues, we don\u2019t need an insubordinate thuggish officer to reinforce that. The academic Dr. Nyce is a walking talking stereotype as imagined by resentful non-academics, predatory, vain, and an intellectual snob. Of course he is!JeJeune\u2019s love interest and live-in love Lindy is a reporter and not interested in birding. Yet she makes bird puns such as \u201csorts the wheatears from the chaffinches?\u201d Really? Lindy also gets inexplicably angry. You know who else does? All the women in the book. Subordinate Lauren Salter, Carrie Pritchard, and supervisor DCS Shepherd, Margaret Wylde and Luisa Obreg\u00f3n, not one of them avoid losing their cool or falling apart. So many overly emotional women. Lucky for Phoebe Hunter, she is dead before the narrative begins, so we don\u2019t see her becoming hysterical.

Maybe the birding angle didn't interest me? Maybe it was the writing style? I really don't know. On the surface of it there was nothing wrong with the premise or the plot line. I quite liked Jejeune's character as well as the lesser characters but maybe there was a bit too much emphasis on insignificant details. We know that Jejeune is an enthusiastic birder, but it seems the only time his personality shines through is at the sight of a flock of mute swans, and even whilst solving a murder his focus is on the welfare of birds. Yes, we know, he's in the wrong job. Part of me wants to tell the author to let him go and study birds if that's what he wants to do. I think Burrows would be better writing non-fiction birding guides, the mix of birding and murders just doesn't work for me. It just reads like an account from an enthusiastic birder and there just happens to be murder thrown in. I won't be investing in any others from this series."}, {"userName": "Vontel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22632750-vontel", "userReview": "It's hard to decide on a rating. The first third of the book seemed to be wandering rather aimlessly and needing some editing, although some of my perception may have been the effect of putting reading it on hold for a while, as well as having already read the third book in the series, which led me back to this one. However, once getting past the first 40% or so of the book, the pace and intensity of the plot certainly picked up. Once again, the author has based the plot on the plight of many bird species globally, and specifically on a particular almost extinct species of dove from an Island off Mexico. That species is pivotal to much heartbreak and death in this mystery. The author raises significant ecological, biological, and social issues which can be of concern to all of us."}, {"userName": "Pgchuis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5195563-pgchuis", "userReview": "3.5* rounded down.I enjoyed the first half of this novel much better than the first book in the series: things happened, actual detecting went on, people were interviewed, it was actually quite fast-moving. But... then it sort of fizzled out. Weeks went by. Jejune eventually went on holiday. Jejeune was his usual uncommunicative self; I cannot stress too often what a nightmare he would be to work for. And then there is his bizarre relationship with Lindy, which I find utterly unconvincing - they seem to have no idea who the other really is and don't particularly like or relax around one another. The solution to the plot was left slightly unknown, but the motivations were in any case a lot of a stretch.

The main character is a transplanted Canadian who works as a police officer in coastal Norfolk and lives with his partner, a journalist. I enjoyed both books very much, and I hope Mr Burrows keeps writing. His descriptions of northern Norfolk and his seamless weaving of bird lore and birder behaviours into his stories are both done wonderfully. The mysteries themselves are less strong, but still good, unfolding in a logical way, without cheats or unrealistic motives. I figured out the reason for the murders quite early in A Pitying of Doves, but I am a lifelong mystery reader who cares more about story and characterization than being fooled by the author, so that did not disappoint me. There were still some interesting surprises as the story unfolded.Mr Burrows' writing is clean and grammatical, a pleasure in this era of sloppy or absent copyediting. The only serious quibble I have with this series is the rather artificial way the author creates tension and mystery around his central character, Domenic Jejeune. It seems perfectly reasonable that Jejeune is a very reserved person. But it is tiresome that Burrows tells us repeatedly, in both books, that his hero wants to work with birds, not bodies. Presumably this is why he is glum and distant with everyone in his life, including his live-in partner and his sergeant. Instead of seeming strong and silent, however, Jejeune often seems merely moody and even a trifle petulant. There is also an ongoing mystery about Jejeune's brother, whom we do not meet, and if Burrows does not explain it in the third book -- and this series definitely merits a third book -- I will be quite irritated. Interestingly, Burrows does a better job of presenting believable and likeable characters in Lindy, Jejeune's partner, and Danny Maik, his sergeant.Burrows has a gift for describing landscape, which anchors his stories beautifully in their location. I would love to see him use this ability to give more physical descriptions of people -- we have no idea what Jejune looks like, for example, or even how old he is -- and also the birds about which Jejeune cares so much. (I admit that I speak there as a birder!)The last few chapters in a Pitying of Doves were wonderful, the best in either book. I hope a third book in the series will match that level of writing, plotting and emotion. I am happy to recommend the first two Birder Murder Mysteries to those who enjoy intelligent plotting, good writing and a little nature lore mixed in with their fiction.WARNING: My book had a pagination problem, so that part of the book was repeated and 30+ pages were missing. I have seen other complaints about this online, so if you buy this book in a store, check for pages 273 to 304. If you buy online, ask the bookseller to check for the problem before shipping."}, {"userName": "Sarah-Hope", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9059923-sarah-hope", "userReview": "Last year, I reviewed the first book in Steve Burrows\u2019 Birder Murder mystery series, A Siege of Bitterns. Since then, I\u2019ve been waiting eagerly for the next novel in this series. Seriously\u2014I wrote the publisher last summer to say, \u201cYou are going to publish more in this series, aren\u2019t you? Please tell me you wouldn\u2019t let this novel be a one-off.\u201d That\u2019s how much I liked the first volume.A Pitying of Doves, the second novel featuring Chief Inspector Domenic Jejeune, is as absorbing and intelligent as its predecessor. Inspector Jejeune, originally from Canada, now lives in a small coastal town in England. He is oddly cursed in his brilliance as a detective: he\u2019d much prefer to be bird-watching. However, having earned national recognition on an earlier case, he faces a steady demand for his services.A Pitying of Doves has a multi-layered plot. It begins with the murder of an odd pair: a grad student who runs a small bird sanctuary and a senior attach\u00e9 with the Mexican Consulate. This immediately sends the investigation in several directions. There\u2019s the grad student\u2019s untrustworthy PhD adviser; the campaign run out of the sanctuary to convince local farmers to set aside land for bird habitat, reducing their production and profits; the widow and son of the reclusive collector of doves, originally from Mexico; more members of the Mexican Consulate; British politicians more concerned with avoiding international slights than with uncovering the murderer; a small-time thief; the former superior officer of one of the sergeants on the case, who severed time in Afghanistan; and the unsteady local woman who insists the sanctuary has stolen birds given to her by her husband.Jejeune, as always, is tight-lipped and highly rational. There\u2019s good reason for any course his investigation takes, but that reason is almost always a complete unknown for those who work with him. The reader, who has slightly more information than Jejeune\u2019s investigative team, still is faced with a multitude of questions as the book progresses.The novel also offers an interesting secondary plot. The grad student had been doing field work in northern Africa studying doves. Now that she\u2019s been killed the position is open\u2014and Jejeune would love nothing more than to leave police work for a chance to work as a field biologist.If you\u2019re a fan of mystery novels with rich characterization and complex plots, put A Pitying of Doves at the top of your summer reading list."}, {"userName": "Breakaway Reviewers", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22317001-breakaway-reviewers", "userReview": "Nom de plumage?!A Siege of Bitterns, A Pitying of Doves, a Cast of Falcons, a Shimmer of Hummingbirds? With titles like these you might be forgiven for fluffy, feathery, ornithological images flashing through your head. And then again you might not!! For this series of \u2018Birder Murder\u2019 mysteries seems to be anything but cuddly. To be fair I\u2019ve only read this second one and to be even fairer still I don\u2019t think the third is even published yet, and the fourth may not even be written! But if A Pitying of Doves is anything to go by we may have a fine series of crime stories ahead of us.Crime and thriller novel series are not hard to find these days but what is harder to find is a series with a unique angle and I think Steve Burrows may have nailed it here.The key player in this series is Dominic Jejeune a detective of Canadian origin living in Norfolk. What makes him different from other detectives? He\u2019s mad about ornithology. And very knowledgeable and passionate about that interest. In fact, he would probably rather be \u2018birding\u2019 than \u2018detecting\u2019. However, he seems to be as good at the latter as he is the former. His record for solving crime is impeccable. He\u2019s a quirky character, more Hamlet than Macbeth, who you never quite feel you\u2019ve got to know but I think that in this case it arouses a desire to read the other books in the series. There are some tantalising hints that there is more to this man\u2019s story than we are to be served in this sitting.The plot is nicely convoluted involving some diplomatic shenanigans with the Mexican Consulate, (What? In Norfolk? I hear you cry) and the bird theme maintains a constant profile without being overdone. I think that is skilful because it would have been very easy to create an uneven balance.The other characters, particularly the team that Dominic has working with him all have their issues and hopefully they will be developed through the ensuing series. And other secondary characters are there to play their parts and that may be one weakness. It\u2019s almost as if the characters that the writer really cares about have been drawn and depicted with greater depth than the bit part players.

I'm a backyard birdwatcher, so I like that angle, but I really wanted to like this series more. If I could keep it out, or if it were much cheaper as a e-book, I would probably finish this eventually and it might even get more stars. For now, though, the characters are not engaging me. And prose like this is not helping: \"At times, she had the air of an art school teacher about her, though with Carrie Pritchard's voluptuos figure leaning over their shoulders, Lindy was sure any teenage boys in her class would have considerably more on their minds than chairascuro [sic].\" The misspelling aside, seriously, who thinks like that? It doesn't help me get into their heads. So if the price comes down, I might give it another chance, but for now there are too many other things I'd rather be doing.Book description: Why would a killer ignore expensive jewellery and take a pair of turtledoves as the only bounty? This is only one of the questions that piques Chief Inspector Domenic Jejeune\u2019s interest after a senior attach\u00e9 with the Mexican Consulate is found murdered alongside the director of a local bird sanctuary. The fact that the director\u2019s death has opened up a full-time research position studying birds hasn\u2019t eluded Jejeune either. Could this be the escape from policing that the celebrated detective has been seeking? Even if it is, Jejeune knows he owes it to the victims to solve the case first. But a trail that weaves from embittered aviary owners to suspicious bird sculptors only seems to be leading him farther from the truth. Meanwhile, Jejeune is discovering that diplomatic co-operation and diplomatic pressure go hand in hand.

The crime/thriller/detective genre is in many ways oversubscribed these days and I think a writer needs a unique yet plausible angle to really pique and sustain the interest of those loving this genre. Having an interest in birds myself went a long way to endear this book to me and the writers own love and knowledge of ornithology was almost palpable here so I feel that box is ticked. I was momentarily reminded of Ann Cleeves The Crow Trap but only momentarily.Inspector Domenic Jejeune is a Canadian detective living in Norfolk and, as is the fashion these days for fictional detectives, is a conflicted, somewhat flawed character. I did wonder sometimes whether he was somewhere on the spectrum as I found him hard to get to know. There were plenty of other characters, maybe as flawed, but somehow more accessible. I also felt there was plenty for development for all of them. My understanding is that there are to be more in the series. Perhaps it would be something of a first to have a whole team as your main \u2018character\u2019 and allow them to develop through a series of novels.The plot is as twisty and as convoluted as you would wish in a good crime yarn.

(Thus a another dilemma for Jejeune as this means that with the directors death there is a position now for a research position studying birds) His moral duty is to solve the crime and solve it he will.A great read by this new up and coming author whose love of bird watching is infectious to the reader. His style of writing is good. The descriptions of the Norfolk coast are absolutely stunning. The author cleverly uses a few twists and turns and as there is a third book on the horizon so there is room for the characters to develop further. A thoroughly recommended read."}], "description": "With murder, everyone pays a price ...Why would a killer ignore expensive jewellery and take a pair of turtledoves as the only bounty?This is only one of the questions that piques Chief Inspector Domenic Jejeune\u2019s interest after a senior attach\u00e9 with the Mexican Consulate is found murdered alongside the director of a local bird sanctuary. The fact that the director\u2019s death has opened up a full-time research position studying birds hasn\u2019t eluded Jejeune either. Could this be the escape from policing that the celebrated detective has been seeking? Even if it is, Jejeune knows he owes it to the victims to solve the case first. But a trail that weaves from embittered aviary owners to suspicious bird sculptors only seems to be leading him farther from the truth. Meanwhile, Jejeune is discovering that diplomatic co-operation and diplomatic pressure go hand in hand.With two careers hanging in the balance, the stakes have never been higher for Inspector Jejeune. And this time, even bringing a killer to justice may not provide the closure he\u2019s looking for.", "title": "A Pitying of Doves\n      \n          (Birder Murder Mystery #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23322785-a-pitying-of-doves", "average": 3.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1422811904l/23322785.jpg", "reviews": 67, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7067716.Steve_Burrows", "name": "Steve Burrows"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Cultural", "Mystery", "European Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23322785-a-pitying-of-doves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29941624-a-pitying-of-doves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17859371-a-siege-of-bitterns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25825991-a-cast-of-falcons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29977286-a-shimmer-of-hummingbirds", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25721506-birder-murder-mysteries-2-book-bundle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33006908-birder-murder-mysteries-4-book-bundle"]}
