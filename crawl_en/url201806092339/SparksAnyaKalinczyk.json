I really hope this subject doesn't come in threes and manifest itself by me bursting into flame. That would just be my luck. Nah, that's too interesting a death. I'm fine.I liked this much better than the first book in the series, so much so that I'm tempted to lower my rating on that one. This had what I felt was lacking in the first one: a greater connection to and presence of her love interest Brian; a big battle that had sides clearly drawn (i.e., I didn't think that I was supposed to empathize with the truly evil person, unlike in the first book where we were supposed to take pity on the really evil villain because he was helping battle someone even more evil, even though it was for selfish purposes--I like shades of gray but this guy was way darker than charcoal to me and I did not like having him be at all sympathetic); help in her epic battle from someone really likable; a really dangerous epic battle where she almost doesn't survive (yes, I know it's formulaic but I like that formula); people, especially her boyfriend, showing great concern for her peril; near death; no sex with evil characters; and so forth.The story was interesting, the pacing was excellent (I read it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down), and there was a nice balance of drama, action, detective work and humor. I really like Bickle's characterizations, each person in the story very clearly defined in my head. I love a new character, Charon, and hope he appears in future installments.I liked the evil villain who is a better/preferable foe than the one in the first book. That guy was evil but supposed to be mildly sympathetic as I mentioned and he just wasn't at all for me. This woman is truly evil, truly powerful, and legitimately scary.\u00a0Anna still has a lot of baggage but some of it was aired out a bit and we gain new perspective on parts of her past. I really don't like that horrible Ishtar painting that the villain in the last book painted for her, the one she slept with after she already knew he was the perpetrator, the guy who she still in this book refers to as a past lover. It's creepy that the woman in the painting looks like her and she still calls it Ishtar and she has it hanging in her bedroom where she refers to it as looking at her. CREEpy.\u00a0There were a few procedural issues that bothered me like the coroner does things in the lab that would completely compromise evidence; a whole lot of evidence gets destroyed because it's exposed but I'm pretty sure that in real life, only one thing is out of its carefully marked and sealed protected container at a time so it is, um, protected, not contaminated by other evidence; and doesn't the coroner have to confirm death on the scene?\u00a0I have to mention one minor irritation that probably won't bother most people at all and that is that at one point the underworld of Greek/Roman mythology is referred to as Hell. IT WAS NOT HELL. Not the same thing at all. Please, people, if you're going to include mythology, fact check.Anyway, I did enjoy this book a lot and it made me eager to read the next one in the series but whoa, there isn't one. Both\u00a0the first and the second books were published in 2010 as was the first book in another series she has, Dark Oracle (which incidentally I didn't really like). The second book in that series was published in 2011. Now she's started a new series, The Hallowed Ones, young adult of course since that's all the rage, which was published this year and the second book is coming out in 2013. Nothing on her site says anything about additional books in the other series even though she has a Twitter account for the salamander in this series I'm reviewing here. (My logic is that if she thinks that salamander is popular enough for that why isn't she working on the next book?) I have discovered a new pet peeve: two book series that haven't been finished that get set aside to start yet another series. Argh.I broke my rule of never reading the last book in a series. I always want there to be one more to look forward to in case it takes the author forever to write another. It's easier for me to hold off after reading a cliffhanger if I know I can always pick up the next book if I want to. It's kind of like quitting chocolate but leaving one bar hidden that you can have any time. Anyway, now I'm regretful because unlike some authors who publish a book in their series every year, this writer doesn't seem to be in much of a hurry.\u00a0Oh well, I have other stuff to keep my occupied until then.\u00a0[My apologies: this was not a well written review, too stream of consciousness, but frankly, I am too lazy to rewrite it.]"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2276205-kelly", "userReview": "In Sparks, Laura Bickle\u2019s follow-up to Embers, Anya Kalinczyk faces another baffling case of magic and mysterious fires. The Detroit Fire Department is confounded by what seem to be instances of spontaneous human combustion. Meanwhile, huckster guru Hope Solomon is amassing wealth and power on the backs of Detroit\u2019s desperate. Anya and her friends are in grave danger when Anya discovers a link between Hope and the fires.Hope Solomon is incredibly creepy. She espouses a blend of the popular \u201claw of attraction\u201d and \u201cpay it forward\u201d philosophies, with a sinister twist. I got a chill down my spine when I realized what she was doing, and I don\u2019t even mean what she was doing supernaturally. If you\u2019ve read anything about cults and/or pyramid schemes, it\u2019ll probably give you a chill too. Hope may be a fantasy villain, but she\u2019d be just as scary without magic and could easily hold her own in a mainstream thriller.Unfortunately, Hope doesn\u2019t get as much page time as one might desire, and the eventual confrontation between her and Anya is a little anticlimactic. Getting there is a harrowing trip, though. Laura Bickle\u2019s depiction of the underworld, which combines Greek myth with a real-life Detroit landmark, is one of the highlights of the book. I\u2019m such a sucker for underworld journeys. I\u2019d probably like it even better if I were familiar with Detroit and the building Bickle describes.Sparks is well-written, but I\u2019m beginning to think this series may not be my cup of tea. It\u2019s simply too bleak, and that\u2019s not just because it\u2019s violent (the violence level is not outside the norm for urban fantasy). It\u2019s not just because Bickle uses Detroit\u2019s present-day social problems as a backdrop either. It\u2019s the pessimism. This is a world where even your closest loved ones may turn out to have a black hole where their ethics should be, and where trying to save someone often ends up with them getting killed anyway. I prefer a little more emotional warmth and a few more moments of triumph.It\u2019s because of this overall pessimistic mood that Sparky, Anya\u2019s familiar, is so very important to the story. In Sparks, Sparky has a plot twist of his own that leads to the book\u2019s few moments of tenderness and comic relief. The salamander is an irresistible bright spot; I plan to continue reading this series, and he may well be the biggest reason.

Although, there were a couple of moments, where I seemed to get close to feeling a connection, she was still all \"facts and nothing but the facts\" and little personality. For the most part, her persona felt impersonal. I appreciated the research and detail that went into developing Anya's arson investigator profession. I believe it. I also think the author does an amazing job with the arson crime enviroments. It was very descriptive and I could imagine walking through and seeing all the damage and smelling the ash and soot. I also think it was cool, that she was still on a self discovery of what being a Lantern was all about. The only problem I had with this, was she seemed to being asking the wrong questions and ignoring the ones that were right in front of her. I had high hopes for Brian's character, so you can imagine my disappointment in him as the story went on. I felt that he loved Anya, but was heading down a path of a mad scientist persona. He wanted to have a more active part in Anya's life, but he was lying to her and she knew it. Pissed me off that she didn't call him out on it. Perhaps, in the next installment. He does have what was suppose to be romantic moment with her, although....Yawn!!! It felt more like booty call, there just wasn't any heart to it. I find that Sparky was still my favorite character. He had no dialogue, but he had the most personality. He was cute, mischievous, and fun. But could be a badass when he needed to be. The author added a surprising and interesting twist as far as he was concerned. (You know a didn't see that coming moment.) Kate was fun and charming as always, and I really hope to see more of the new character, Charon in the future. I thought the plot was very well done. Laura Bickle merges Anya's investigator profession with her Lantern responsibilites quite nicely. I also felt the author did an amazing job with the villian, Hope Solomon, a TV Evangelist who headed an organization called Miracles for the Masses. I found her to be very crediable in a creapy realistic way. Although, her mission was more of a paramid scheme with a sadistic twist. Hope Soloman preached all about paying it forward, helping those who had lost all hope. But in truth, it was more of a \"deal with the devil\" situation. When Anya and Hope interacted...there were definately sparks... Overall, as mentioned above, I liked this second installment, better than the first, Embers. Although, I thought this book lacked the character depth needed to make the characters engaging, I thought the plot was very interesting and it kept me turning the pages. There were several moments, when the story would loose its momentum, but towards the end, it picked up nicely and gave a satisfying ending. I find it refreshing, that Laura Bickle steps out of the norm of urban fantasy and gives her readers something unigue and interesting. It was a nice blend of the afterworld, human spontaneous combustion, ghost hunting, and mythology. It defiantely gives the author a plethora of possiblities for future books."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666242-julia", "userReview": "Review courtesy of All Things Urban FantasySPARKS is many things: a funny tale of a girl and her salamander, an ode to the city of Detroit, a startlingly unique romance, and a gritty, noir mystery. These first qualities worked much better for me than the last. I found the villain tepid and uninteresting when juxtaposed with Anya\u2019s dark past, an impending newt hatching, or the romantic antics of the Detroit Museum of Arts ghost population. This flaw ultimately made me unmotivated to finish the book, despite the aspects that I enjoyed.As in Bickle\u2019s previous book, I thought the relationships in SPARKS were nuanced and well written. In Embers Anya has a brief fling with a man she knows to be an arsonist. Drake Ferrer was a bit too creepy for me to understand Anya\u2019s attraction to him (think Batman if Bruce Wayne had chosen the dark side), though I applauded Bickle\u2019s willingness to deviate from the normal proscribed relationships a heroine can explore. Similarly, in SPARKS, I found myself more impressed with the unusual realism of Anya\u2019s relationship with Brian than with Brian himself. Anya is allowed to have both positive and negative feelings for Brian, and as a reader, I never felt that great sex was meant to signal Anya finding her soul-mate. In breaking common romance cliches, Bickle writes a more noteworthy relationship. Not since Charlaine Harris or Kim Harrison have I found an author who so deftly keeps you wondering about a romantic \u201chappily ever after.\u201dThere are some shades of HEA in this book, just not where you might expect it. Anya may date Brian, but the true love of her life is her salamander. Sparky was a bright spot in Embers, and he truly shines in SPARKS. His hi-jinx are utter entertainment, leavened with real-world consequences. As odd as it might sound, the large, invisible salamander was portrayed with both realism and charm. Bickle takes every child\u2019s imaginary friend and gives it depth by adding the joys (and difficulties) of owning a real pet. The scenes with Sparky are what I laughed at and read out to my husband.Despite all of the individual aspects of this book that I admired, I still found their combination to be missing some essential spark. I am interested in reading more about Anya in the future, but will look for the next book at the library.Sexual Content: Brief sensuality and a non-graphic sex scene."}, {"userName": "Katie(babs)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/179852-katie-babs", "userReview": "Detroit Fire Department arson investigator, Anya Kalinczyk is called to the scene of a gruesome fire at the home of Jasper Bernard. It seems that Jasper was a victim of spontaneous human combustion, although Anya knows something more sinister is at play. She can smell evil magic around the crime scene. Anya has this ability, because she is also a Lantern, a psychic medium who can see and talk to ghosts, as well as help them cross over to the other side.Jasper has a connection to Hope Solomon, a fraudulent psychic who hides behind a non-profit organization that promises miracles to those who have lost all hope. She also goes around collecting spirits for her own devious means. Along with Anya\u2019s salamander familiar, Sparky, and her fellow group of paranormal investigators from the Detroit Area Ghost Researchers, she\u2019ll do whatever she can to stop Hope, even though she may be putting her life in danger, much like she did six months ago when her deceased, unstable lover tried to being forth a demon to destroy the world.Sparks has this great element of suspense where you don\u2019t know what will happen to Anya next as she takes it upon herself to solve unnatural crimes that may just get her killed. Laura Bickle is very skilled at writing a taut police like procedural novel, but with many supernatural elements. Anya is always moving, never sitting still, and does a few questionable things that she should really think about first before she reacts.One enjoyment in reading Sparks is Anya\u2019s loving protector, Sparky, who is adorable and will make readers laugh. The cast of characters Anya surrounds herself with, such as Brian, one of the ghost researchers who wants to take their relationship to the next level, brings forth a romantic element. Even with this subtle romance and the crime Anya is involved with, Sparks is very lackluster and loses momentum as Anya gets closer to the truth. Sparks falters toward the middle where one may question whether they should read to the very end.Even with a few issues on my end, Sparks is a unique Urban Fantasy that has some merit, but one that may become lost in the shuffle of more exciting Urban Fantasies that are being released. If you\u2019re one who likes mystery with a nice paranormal slant, do give this latest by Laura Bickle a try. As for this reader, I\u2019m not certain if I will continue reading with the next release."}, {"userName": "Larissa", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2945573-larissa", "userReview": "*4 & 1/2 Stars out of 5!As much as I absolutely love Urban Fantasy, it is not often that a book or series brings something new to the table. When that happens, I can\u2019t help but feel my love for the genre being reignited. I was pleasantly surprised by Embers a few months ago and was really excited about reading its sequel, Sparks. I have to say that Laura Bickle has done a superb job with this book and she has delivered an even better one than her debut.Sparks starts off 3 months after the events in Embers and we find Anya trying to cope with the happenings of the previous book, while she also gives a shot at moving on and giving her DAGR colleague, Brian, a chance at her heart. I am really loving Anya as a character and I feel that in this book she has evolved a lot. She has to deal with so many trial and tribulations in Sparks and the stakes just keep getting higher and higher.We get an awful Villain in Sparks and she is just vile! We also get to see Anya learn more about her powers, interact with spirits and even deal first hand with her tragic past, which she has been avoiding for a long time. She also learns the truth about her mom\u2019s death and we get a new mystery in the form of \u201cWho the hell is Anya\u2019s father?\u201d. All the great side characters from Embers are back in Sparks and we even get some new ones that I can\u2019t wait to read more about.I really enjoyed the plot of Sparks and the set up for future stories just make me want more and more. I\u2019m really rooting for Anya' and Brian\u2019s relationship, but I feel that there will be much trouble ahead and I can\u2019t wait to read about it. I really want my girl Anya to be happy, now, is Brian is her HEA? Well, that is definitely up for debate.Sparks is such a thrill ride that I did NOT want to get down from! I read the book in one sitting and the pace was perfect and full of non-stop action. I just know now that Laura Bickle is the kind of author that will only get better with each book and I really hope there will be more books in this series. This is an awesome new Urban Fantasy series that you just have to read.

I loved the first book Embers, especially because of Anya's familiar Sparky who outshone everyone and everything in my opinion. That being said: I absolutely love Sparks! And this time it's quite a bit harder to name one specific thing that outshone the rest I can tell you. Sparky does shine ofcourse (both while guarding his bathtub full of newts and while wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting Baby Super Store) but Anya shines as well in a way she didn't and most probably couldn't in Embers. Where she was emotionally quite closed off in the previous book she's opening up in this one, making her vulnerable in a way that makes you want to hug her and kick some butt among those who pester her. The other characters are very intriguing as well, some raising some questions about who and what they truly are and others making you wish you had them as a friend. The one negative thing I can say is that at the moment it's not clear if there will be more books in this series.

I really enjoyed Laura Bickle's gritty urban fantasy novel based in Detroit, Michigan. I'm slightly biased since I'm from Michigan and have been to Detroit many times...thankfully I didn't have to deal with a psychotic psychic ghost snatcher.2). Anya is a Lantern, a special form of medium that has the ability to devour spirits. They are drawn to her elemental light and then she goes through the painful process of eating them so-to-speak. She is also an arson investigator with the Detroit Fire Department as well as a sort-of member of the Detroit Area Ghost Researchers (DAGR).Beginning a few months after the end of Book 1, Embers, we find that Anya is still reeling from the events that occurred previously. She is still part of DAGR, albeit reluctantly. Anya has also decided to attempt a relationship of sorts with Brian. Anya is soon called to the home of Jasper Bernard (Bernie) to find what appears to be spontaneous human combustion or a condition known as the \"wick effect\" (which is explained around page 10). Anya knows the truth as soon as she enters Bernie's home and smells all of the magick in the air. Not sure what she's dealing with, she goes along with the normal processing of the scene of the fire hoping that something other than sinister magic is the explanation. She soon discovers that a TV psychic who preys upon those less fortunate isn't at all what she seems. She's an evil woman that is scooping of the city's wandering spirits faster than Anya can blink her eyes and holding them in vessels where she can completely control them, forcing the ghosts to do her evil bidding. When Hope has her sites set on the Pandora's Jar, a vessel that can hold thousands of spirits, Anya knows her time to stop the evil psychic is limited.In the meantime, Anya's salamander familiar, Sparky, lays a clutch of eggs (51 to be exact), causing Anya to refocus on the protection of not only the entire city and the ghosts within but 51 newt filled eggs. Sparky really steals the show in both books. He's invisible to almost everyone but causes so much trouble with his affinity to anything electrical. When he lays his eggs in Book 2, his whole demeanor changes (he becomes maternal--when you read the passages in the book that describe this, you'll understand how the words \"he\" and \"maternal\" can be used to describe Sparky) and he becomes the perfect protector, trusting only Anya to care for the babies; she carries them in what has been affectionately dubbed the \"newt transporter.\" Anya's character is a little more open in this book, allowing us to see a little softer side, especially in regards to the blossoming romance with Brian. Although there are some issues that Anya has to consider, she doesn't dwell on them incessantly. She works her way through them, for the most part, while handling the other crises that arise within the pages. This gives the novel a very real feeling. No one's life if 100% smooth. We all have to deal with the day-to-day stuff right along with the problems, upsets, joys, and pains that sneak their way in. I really enjoyed Sparks; as much, if not more, that Embers. Laura Bickle has a writing style that appeals to me. There wasn't any part in the book that had me stumped, shaking my head, or wondering when it was going to pick back up. The plot is unique and I found it to be pretty consistent with not only the events that take place in this book, but with what was in Book 1, as well. Noteworthy Quotes:Anya: \"She had to admit, though, that it was hard to believe in a better future for Detroit. If she lay in bed,sleepless in the early hours of the morning, she swore she could almost hear the brittle city rusting\" (L. Bickle, 2010, pg. 38).Brian: \"It\u2019s a sociological fact: People get stupid in groups\u201d (L. Bickle, 2010, pg. 38)."}, {"userName": "keikii", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20276605-keikii", "userReview": "30 points/100 (1.75 stars/5).Anya gets put on a case of spontaneous human combustion, Sparky has babies, and there is a con artist trapping ghosts.How was this book worse than the last one? How? I don't get it. I really did not care about basically everything in this book. I was reading as fast as I could just to get through it since I try not to DNF anything, and it still wasn't fast enough. I thought it was moving at the speed of molasses, and I was reading as fast as I have ever read before. Now that Bickle has moved through arson, she has to come up with another fire related thing, so of course spontaneous human combustion happens, because it is literally the only thing else other than \"completely mundane accidents\". If she ever got a third book, I wonder what she would have managed to come up with then. Anya is just plain boring in this book. Honestly, I finished that book ten minutes ago, and I really couldn't tell you anything about her that makes her into a proper person. She is a puppet for the author's whims. She doesn't seem to think, she doesn't seem to act unless prompted. She just exists to be moved around like a piece on the board.For some unexplainable reason, a very, very large portion of this book was taken up by Sparky giving birth. And Anya having to go baby shopping for the eggs?? And worry about the eggs. And even though she was threatened by the villain of the book naught but the day before, she still decides to leave the necklace, Sparky, and the eggs at home while she goes to work? Why, why, why was this all in this book?The world-building also somehow devolved. While it wasn't really fleshed out before, it took an even further nose dive here. The author kept adding new concepts and mythologies on top of what she had already established. Only, she spent basically no time either doing anything with them, explaining anything with them, or caring about them. Why should I, as a reader, care about something if the author clearly demonstrates that she doesn't give a shit either? I don't get it. A lot of the threads that were introduced were blown off in a way that made me feel like she expected to get to it in other books, but she never got her contract extend so it is just sitting there, unfulfilled now.The romance is also a complete farce. It is only there because the author felt the readers expected a romance. Or, maybe it was there to fill word counts. I'm not certain, because there is no on screen development of this relationship. She seems to constantly forget she even has a boyfriend lying around in wait, except when she wants to have the character fuck him. And then, there was that whole thing about maybe the boyfriend is a bad guy after all, because he did some very questionable shit. Only, that went absolutely nowhere, either. Seriously, I believe both Anya and the boyfriend are horrible people for the way they lie to each other like what is demonstrated in this series.From a quarter of the way into this book, I just wanted it to be over already. Unfortunately, it didn't reward my request for another forever.

She juggles her daytime job as an arson investigator with the Detroit Fire Department, her activities with a paranormal investigation team, and her new relationship with Brian, the ghost researchers\u2019 tech guy. Life is so far is good until Anya is called to investigate a rash of human combustion cases that link to a suspicious non-profit group. To make matters worse, Anya\u2019s loyal salamander sidekick, Sparky, has hatched 51 baby eggs, and Anya has to balance nanny duties on top of her investigations! Soon, Anya has to fight off an evil villain that\u2019s causing the human combustion phenomena and targeting Sparky and his precious babies...Laura Bickle knows how to set up a story. At first, the plot seems to consist of myriad of problems, all seemingly unrelated to each other, but towards the end, all the plotlines just merged beautifully to present this cohesive and fun read that vibrates with humor and excitement. In short, Sparks is as good as Embers (her first book), and it really makes me wish that Bickle could write faster! I must admit though that I am a bit concerned at the lack of an overarching plotline. I mean, yes, Anya is on a journey to discover more about herself and her ability as a Lantern, but I\u2019m worried that without a long-term goal, Bickle\u2019s series will end up like Laura Hamilton\u2019s long running \u201cAnita Blake\u201d - poorly quality, irrelevant, and seen by fans as a way to milk more of their hard-earned cash. I sincerely hope that Anya\u2019s journey has a finishing line. Even though I will be sad when the last book comes, it will make me cherish the series even more.In the meantime, Bickle gives us a wonderful 2nd novel. There are so many times I found myself giggling while reading Sparky\u2019s antics (warming his belly on a foot high flame! LOL). To me, Sparky is the heart of book. His endearing innocence and love is what gives Anya the courage to keep moving forward. Anya is once again deftly brought to life by Bickle. Instead of a stereotypical tough as nail chick heroine that\u2019s been recycled to death, Anya is fragile and conflicted about her relationship with Brian. She can be tough when she has to, but for most of the time, she\u2019s reminds me of Peter Parker from Spiderman. She just wants to be normal, and that is precisely why Anya is a believable and endearing character. You can\u2019t help but root for her. Bickle also introduces a new character - Charon. We don\u2019t get to see much of his personality, but I am excited to read more about him in the third book. Will he plays a much more pivotal role in the future? I do hope so.In short, Sparks is a great read. Bickle has once again proven that she\u2019s an awesome writer that can concoct a wonderful blend of fantasy, humor, and romance. I definitely can\u2019t wait for the next book!

Anya and Sparky are back in Sparks, with more ghosts, more creepies, and more bang for your buck. There is also a new fabulous baddie is in their midst\u2026.shyster Hope Soloman who runs Miracles for the Masses in Detroit who is intent on wreaking havoc, despair and destruction. You name it, she either wants to break it or rule it and she\u2019s giving Anya a run for the money. Anya might have defeated Sirrush and Mimiveh in Embers, but now she may be way in over her head.This time Anya must track down Hope who is capturing entities into spirit jars, and essentially controlling them-forcing them to maim and kill-and she\u2019s leaving a trail of corpses all over Detroit. The ultimate source of power that Hope is after is the reputed Pandora\u2019s Jar that is currently on loan to the Detroit Institute of the Arts. Anya suspects that it could it be an enormous spirit jar. With such an artifact at her disposal, Hope could possibly command thousands of ghosts to do her bidding and eventually tip the power of Hell itself. And Anya must do whatever she can to stop her.Armed with the eternal Charon (who is a hottie), Sparky and a brood of newly hatched salamanders, Anya might finally be on the path of fulfilling her destiny-the hints of Anya being one of Ishtar\u2019s chosen ones is thrilling and hopefully Bickle will pursue this next. One of the most important clues we get in Sparks, is the real truth behind the devastating fire that killed Anya\u2019s mother, as well as her mysterious father, and some harsh truths about Brians\u2019 character. There is little to no romance in Sparks, and Bickle might be hinting that Brian is on his way out (yes\u2026breath a sigh of relief). With the introduction of Charon who is ready and willing to help, I can only wonder\u2026will he be the next in line? There is also the interesting take on the A.I. that Brian develops (ALANN) at the university with a captured soul at its technological core-this concept reminds me strongly of Rachel Caine\u2019s Morganville Vampires series and evil Ada who was the ghost in Myrnin\u2019s machine. Bickle has done herself proud with Sparks, because this time around there are more shades of Anya, and readers get closer to her as a character. There is also the added bonus of new forays into Detroit\u2019s underground which lends Sparks a great edgy, gritty, darkness. Anya ventures to Hell, the astral plane, Michigan Central Station (the way station of the ghostly realm), and even sewers\u2026all great backdrops to the action and suspense that Bickle has mapped out. And that earlier indecisiveness and unsteady footing that might have been present in Embers is missing. In its place, is a competent writer who has realized her vision with this series, plunged head first to write an exciting and visually stunning sequel.

I rated it 4.5 out of 5 stars.Sparks, the second book in the Anya Kalinczyk series, begins a short time after the end of the events in the previous book. Once again Ms. Bickle drew me into Anya's strange and unique world and I didn't want the story to end. Introducing some new characters, both human and paranormal, Ms. Bickle continued the world building which makes this series so unique.Trying to solve a series of strange fires, which have the appearance of spontaneous human combustion, which are spreading across town, Anya is still trying to balance her human and her secret paranormal job. When Anya identifies left over magic at the latest victims house, it turns out the man had a loose connection to Ciro, the head of the DAGR (Detroit Area Ghost Researchers). Uncomfortable with the way her investigation is leading, Anya also has to deal with Sparky's (her salamander familiar) changing behavior. She never planned on having to make a trip down the River Styx or on Sparky becoming a parent.As Anya begins to suspect a local con-woman turned television preacher of being involved in dark magic and causing all of the fires, she finds herself dealing with her attraction to a fellow ghost fighter and with Sparky's need to nest over his eggs. Spending money on baby supplies has just become another weird thing in Anya's life. When the fight becomes personal, her house is burned down in a dark magic attack, Anya finds herself rescuing Sparky and his newly hatched newts and having to temporarily move in with a friend who's a witch.Discovering she'll have to take the battle against the dark magic user to the astral plane and make a visit to Hell is dangerous but apparently Anya's only choice. I really liked how Ms. Bickle continued developing the paranormal world Anya has to deal with and began to address Anya's left over issues from her childhood. Adding a touch of romance also gave Anya a touch of humanity she needed very much. It made it even easier to relate to her since she's got so much bottled up. Will Anya, Sparky and the newborn newts be strong enough to fight their new enemy? And just who is the Ferryman she has to pay to get to her destination?You'll have to read Sparks to find out. I really enjoyed it and I think you will to. My question for Ms. Bickle is if we'll get more adventures with Anya and Sparky - I'd really like to see more books set in this world."}, {"userName": "\u0466\u047a\u2122", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4555905", "userReview": "A spark neglected makes a mighty fire. - Robert HerrickAnya Kalinczyk, arson investigator for the Detroit Fire Department, and her salamander familiar Sparky are back to handle another bizarre case. this time, bodies appear to have spontaneously combusted and spirits are being collected by a charismatic celebrity psychic for her own nefarious gain. if i loved Embers, the first book in the Anya Kalinczyk series, i loved this second one even more. author Laura Bickle has written a worthy sequel. the writing style is consistent with Embers and the worldbuilding is just as imaginative and creative. aside from introducing new characters, the author has also whet my appetite by providing lots of revelations and surprises about Anya, Sparky and some members of the Detroit Area Ghost Researchers (DARG) team. i like Anya better now. her character has grown to a certain degree. what she went through in Embers has allowed her to slowly pull down the wall that she has built around herself. Sparky is as adorable as ever especially with the addition of the salamander familiar's newly hatched newts. the ruckus that Sparky caused at a baby superstore was the lightest and funniest moment in the book. Anya learns something about her boyfriend Brian as well that may or may not threaten their relationship.i wish i could say that this book can stand alone but i cannot. Embers and Sparks need to be read and enjoyed together. i also wish i could assure you that there is a happy ending and all goes well. perhaps, to some extent there is and it does yet ...i found so many good things in this book that i want to talk about but it has never been my style to spoil someone's reading pleasure. all i can disclose further is that i certainly look forward to reading more about Anya, Sparky and the newts, DARG and the supernatural occurrences in the city of Detroit.

It's refreshingly low-key; not that it's boring (not at all!), but there's no contrived conflict or enforced \"high drama\" moments. All the conflict and drama evolve organically. Plus, Anya's romantic and/or sexual liaisons are not overwrought, nor are they the focus of her life (or of the plot). Three cheers for that, for what this series is not, but SPARKS (as well as its predecessor EMBERS) is noteworthy for what is is.It's true urban fantasy in that the urban (the city of Detroit) is just as important as the fantasy. The realism is marvelous, because Anya and her world feels real. Reading these books is like taking a hard look at a city and seeing the magic and the pain and the ghosts that reside just underneath the surface. As one of the characters says, \"[...] when you see beyond the mundane physical world, you realize the fingers of myth are all around you, touching and underneath everything.\" Anya's world is mythic in a way both modern and traditional, but I think it's the ordinariness of the characters, who feel contemporary and are mixed up with magic and myth by virtue of who they are (some with a longstanding interest in the paranormal, others with a religious commitment to keep demons at bay), that keep the story grounded and not over the top. Okay, one character is over the top, and that's Sparky, but Sparky is awesome, and he's a salamander, so he has an excuse.This book really worked for me, and I found it was quite a satisfying follow-up because the consequences of the first book are touched upon, some old mysteries are partially answered (bits and pieces of Anya's history), relationships are built (Katie, Katie, Katie, you are awesome!) or are unsettled (Brian, Brian, Brian, what are you doing?), new developments happen in the lives of the main characters (I won't spoil it, but Sparky!), and the world-building continues to be fascinating and complicated (Hey there, Charon! Let's have another talk about avatars, please!). It's funny and charming at times, sad and evocative at others, and it feels emotionally authentic. Plus, it incorporates one of my very favorite plots ever (a mortal's descent into the underworld), so I'm a happy reader."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477505-mandy", "userReview": "I received Sparks as part of the blog tour hosted by Bewitching Book Tours in return for an honest review. Anya's days are divided between working as a arson investigator and dealing with out of control spirits. She's not alone in her adventure she's joined by her elemental familiar Sparky who happens to be a salamander plus her ghost hunting group. Anya isn't your typical Detroit girl she's a lantern which means that she can communicate with ghosts as well as she has the gift to eat them ending there existence. However life hasn't been easy with the accident that killed her mother, and being afraid to let anyone close she's had a hard time. Anya has a new arson case that she's working on which involves spontaneous human combustion leaving very little remains behind. Jasper Bernard was a dealer is magic stuff from swords to bottles with bones in them, and when his all the magical artifacts go missing after his death Anya has more then just a case to solve. Hope Solomon is a celebrity psychic is in town collecting spirits for her own twisted plans. Anya is also trying to keep her relationship with Brian because after the scare in the first book when she almost lost him she's not ready to lose the chance again. Plus Sparkys has new babies thrown into the mix Anya has her hands full just keeping it together.I really love Anya as a character she's grown so much from Ember and to me she just keeps getting better with age. This is only my second book about ghost but the concept for Anya's character being a lantern I find really unique. Plus she's in not your typical investigator she works for the fire department which is also new for me but I really like seeing a new form of investigator. As with the first book I love Sparky I want my own Sparky that's just like hers. The supernatural world that is created in the book works really well for the series, incorporating a variety of characters that work well. As with the first I found the book well written the story flows along smoothly making it easy to loose track of time while reading. Which this series has done a lot to me but it's that's alright it was worth it. As Sparks progresses we see Anya growing as a character from who she started out as in the first book. I highly suggest if your into ghosts and like a good suspense then you should check out Anya's series. I really hope for a third book because I have questions that still need answers."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3256911-sara", "userReview": "Plot: 4 StarsI really liked the idea of workers and curses, and whether or not the powers are used for good or evil. It was a very unique take the typical \"magic\" or \"curses\" often seen in young adult and urban fantasy novels. The different types of workers and how they operated could've been elaborated on a little more, so I'm hoping we'll find out more in the sequel. I only had a small issue with the plot, that being that I was a bit confused at times. Cassel, the main character, was also confused so I guess it fit, but I just wish a few details here and there could've been explained a little better. Pace: 3.5 StarsThe pace of this novel was uneven. The beginning started out a bit slow, but sucked me in after a couple chapters. Then there was a lull in the plot a chapter or two before the climax, but when it reached that point, I couldn't put the book down and was handed twist after twist. There were some scenes that seemed pointless when I read them, but made sense later on, and then there were one or two that never really fit in.Characters: 4 StarsCassel was a very likeable main character. I like young adult novels with male main characters, and they don't come along all that often, so I was psyched. I liked the inner turmoil that Cassel went through and how he dealt with it. His grandfather was another character I enjoyed. His older brothers were a bit touch and go for me. I could never quite figure out whether or not I should like them, or whether or not I actually did. But that doesn't mean the author did anything wrong; I actually think the reader is supposed to be unsure of those two. All in all, it was a very interesting cast of characters, workers and non-workers alike.Cover: 4.5 StarI'm a sucker for covers with fluffy cats on them. But besides the cute kitty, the color and font choices make for a striking color. The shadows and black background make the cover model look mysterious, which really fits the character. The red and white text stands out without being too crazy, or giving off the wrong vibe.Overall: 4 Stars Disclosure: I bought this book for my own enjoyment."}, {"userName": "Lexie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/712966-lexie", "userReview": "In my review of Embers I remarked that part of why Anya liked Brian was because of his 'ordinariness'. Brain and tech-geek he may be, but he was rather simple at heart. So of course it couldn't stay that way. Like Anya I'm unsure how I feel about the revelation about Brian's character. I mean considering what they do, it seemed odd that he'd mess with things like that. Hope Solomon, motivational speaker philanthropist extraordinaire, gave me the creeps. Even before Anya found the dirt on her she made my skin crawl. I understand that there are honest to goodness helpful folks out there. I also understand that for everyone of them there's fifty of the Hope Solomons in the world. Unlike Drake, who truly believed that what he was doing would help (somehow), Hope was purely in it for the greed. Money, power, fame...this lady cared only about herself. So she was the perfect foil to Anya's growing uneasiness about her powers and herself. Sparky had baby newts! Mind you technically speaking Sparky isn't a he or a she, Anya just labeled him thus, but it gave us a chance to have whacky fun times in a Baby Store and see Anya act like a mother hen. Also fun, all the nifty gadgetry Brian came up with to help Anya out. The whacky fun times in the store though seemed out of place--like this one moment of cheerfulness in an otherwise dark, dark novel. It was kind of jarring, so even though I enjoyed the scene it didn't 'feel' right. Charon pops up again and has a larger role than just cryptic messenger. I really liked him and sincerely hope he appears in the series again. He didn't beat around the bush, though he omitted certain details to keep things moving along. The ghosts in the museum? They were fun and interesting. Kind of like \"Night at the Museum\" but with more mayhem.  I wonder at the consequences of this fight on Anya. Not just supernaturally, but personally. She learned things about Brian that were unsettling, the team itself is headed for self-destruct and the news about her father, and the truth of what happened when her mom died?

(I'm a total wuss about that kind of suspense.) I won't spoil it for you, but I will say that while there was some sadness, it was in keeping with the rest of the series in that it left me hopeful enough to finish reading. That could be said of the rest of the story as well: Anya lives in a dying town acting as a shepherd of sorts for the dead-but-not-departed. Sadness permeates her life, but she's able to take action to make things better for others. (Except when her familiar, the salamander Sparky, accidentally sets things on fire, destroying evidence and retail merchandise, among other things.)The focus of the story is on Anya's work, solving fire- and ghost-related crimes, and her relationship with Sparky. There is a love interest in the form of geeky ghost-hunter Brian, but even Anya has doubts about how well that will turn out. (My reaction: she likes him because he's normal and she needs something stable in her life, but I find him amoral bordering on creepy. I get the feeling that that's intentional by the author, and I kind of worry about what kind of trouble he's going to cause Anya in the future.) That said, if you like your urban fantasy with a heavy dose of romance, this probably isn't going to do it for you.I'll agree with other reviewers that the villain in this book wasn't very interesting. However, the new character, Charon, and the glimpses we get of Anya's biological father -- those were interesting. I'm very curious about how things will play out in future books.If you like UF that's a little more thoughtful, with a focus more on scientific investigations of the paranormal than on swordplay, I highly recommend this series.

It's still not fantastic, there are a few odd elements that continue to snag my attention, but it is above average. I love Sparky and the newts! Sparky continues to be adorable, the perfect side-kick, and caring for him and the newts brought out a welcomed nurturing and emotional side to Anya. She tends to be all closed up emotionally, which is part of the story, but makes it hard for the reader to connect with her. The little ones helped make her more sympathetic.I'm glad we're finally seeing hints about Anya's past and I like the way the author is drawing it out into the next book; good beginning of a story arc.At first I didn't like the Charon character. It felt like an easy out, introducing this guy who can easily give Anya all of the answers she needs instead of finding a way for her to figure it out organically through the story. But he appears again later in the story and becomes more of an integral character, so I ended up liking it. Speaking of Charon, I also like the continued use of mythology. It's pretty typical, but she adds good explanations that make it make sense in the context of this story. I especially like the avatars concept, which explains some of the things I disliked in the first book. The synchronicity concept, the way that Anya is identified with Ishtar, makes the annoying demon possession story in Embers make more sense.The ghosts in this book continued to be great; once again they have the charm and personality that Anya sometimes lacks. Gallus and Pluto were great.What I hated was the sudden conclusions.

Sometimes the best thing about discovering an ongoing series is getting to read the books back to back. I loved being able to go directly from Ember into Sparks. This second book could probably be read as a stand alone, but why would you want to? This story opens with Anya at a new arson case she has been asked to investigate. At a first glance, it looks like Spontaneous Human Combustion. But no one wants that to be the official cause and Anya is ordered to find out what happened. With the stink of magic and several rooms full of magic artifacts all around, Anya figures it has something to do with magic. However, without knowing exactly what the items can do, they aren't much of a clue.When an apparent break in at the Detrioit Museum of Arts leads to the death of two guards, one suffocated from halon gas and the other from weird burns, Anya struggles to find out just what is happening. She knows the cases must be connected, but with Sparky laying eggs, her energy and attention is divided. This was a wonderful follow up book. In many ways it was better than the first. We get a return of DAGR, plus some new characters. Once again, Detriot plays the part of a secondary character and we are shown both the pride and problems of the city. And Sparky was so adorable as a Daddy. The world building continued and though we got some answers, for me it just leads to more questions. Which is what keeps you coming back for more.

This time, Anya deals with possible cases of spontaneous human combustion, ghosts stealing artifacts, and her salamander Sparky having babies!I enjoy the second story as much as the first one. Anya as heroine still charms me. Her fire salamander spirit, Sparky, as well. In this book, Sparky is having babies (Sparky is a boy, but there is an explanation on how he can have babies :D), and Anya shopping for baby stuffs and the scene of her and Sparky protecting the eggs are two of my most favorite moments. It's so tender and touching. Anya has deep connection to Sparky and I'm loving every moment of it.The intriguing element of myth also appears here. In book one, there is a touch of Babylonian myth ... here, there is a touch of myth with Hell, Kerberus, Styx river, and astral trane that brings dead soul across. There are also ghosts that having fun after hours at Detroit Institute of Arts.There is also a sad development at the end of the book. I sort of did not see it coming.The only complaint that I have will be the related to Anya and Brian's relationship. Not the lack of it ... I can take that (this is urban fantasy after all, not romance). I don't like the seed of doubts that planted about Brian's \"moral\" character.
