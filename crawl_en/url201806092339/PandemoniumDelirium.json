That ending. That had to be the most awkward \"awkward moment\" I've ever read in a book. EVER.But then a bit later on, it hits me how hilarious the situation Lena's gotten herself in and the laughter starts.Oh, Lena. You poor, poor girl. But what a hell of a book. Where is the next one when I need it the most?***Before reading Pandemonium, I really doubted that this book could follow up to Delirium and its (tragic) ending. There had just been too many shitty sequels that could make me enthusiastic about reading them. But I really should've known better than to doubt Lauren Oliver.In Pandemonium, Lena is having to survive in the Wilds with her new friends, is having to prove herself worthy to be in the resistance, and is having to forget the boy who made her rebel in the first place, infected her, Alex. I know that in Delirium, a number of people didn't find Lena that \"kick-ass\" heroine that we all love (in her defense, all those rules would scare me too, into rebelling). But in Pandemonium, I feel that she definitely redeemed herself. Now without all those regulations and boundaries, Lena was able to unleash her inner survivalist, which wasn't a very easy thing to do, after all that she's been through. She even is deemed strong enough by her fellow rebels to be part of the resistance. I definitely saw more of Lena in action scenes (and winning) in this book than in the previous. So I definitely think of her as part of the \"kick-ass heroine\" club now.I also know that a lot of you didn't really like the fact that Lena is \"allegedly\" going to fall in love with someone other than Alex, and I'm sorry to tell you guys, but that fact is true. If that is enough for you to run away screaming from this book, by all means, do, but let me just tell you now, you are missing out on a hell of a lot of goodies if you do that. I have to admit though, I did kind of dislike Lena's new love interest. It might be because he, for me, was a little naive or it could be plainly just because he wasn't Alex. Also, at times, I felt that their relationship was a little forced. The love interest, Julian, would say weird things like, \"your hair smells like roses\" or \"your waist is so small\" (yes), that not only creeped Lena out, but creeped me out too. I don't know if it was just lack of being around females that made him act this way (and trust me; I go to an all girls school and whenever a person of the opposite walks by, my beloved classmates throw themselves at him) or what, but I was pretty skeptical of him at first. After a while, though, and getting to know his character more, he grew on me, but of course, before it got more than that, the ending got in the way of everything (as expressed in the mini review above).An aspect of the book I really enjoyed was Lena's life in the Wilds. In Delirium we didn't really get to experience the Wilds too much and that was something I was really looking forward to in this book. As cool as I thought it would be, living in the Wilds, it ended up not being the \"paradise\" that I was expecting. It was actually pretty brutal out there, and with the addition of Scavengers (Invalids that attack just for kicks) it became even harder to survive out there. I quite liked all the new characters too, Raven, Tack, Hunter. Loved them, and the fact that they gave birth to Lena in the woods, as Lena said about Raven in the book. Other than creepy Julian and the random add of Scavengers (and the possible future love triangle as hinted in the ending of Pandemonium), I very, very much enjoyed this book, and you have no idea how much I'm craving for the next and final book. But I guess after that killer cliff-hanger, who wouldn't?"}, {"userName": "shady boots | #20gayteen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4972138-shady-boots-20gayteen", "userReview": "[To be honest, the fact that Alex is still alive kind of makes me happy and horrified at the same time.

I'd give it a one, but I reserve those for books I truly loathe and I just dislike this one. So.I have grown tired of poorly created dystopian worlds that exist not to make us think, but only as a prop for.... what do you think it will be? Guess. Guess. I dare you. Yeah, we are there yet again. In the ubiquitous love triangle. So manufactured and so terribly unneccessary and really, can these authors think of nothing else to add tension to a story or, I should say, to lengthen a story?Again, too much of this book is wandering in the Wilds, in the cold, in the snow, and some of the things make no sense. They have no eating utensils. None. So they eat with their hands. They have plates, cooking pots, they even have metal traps for hunting but not a single spoon or fork. And so I am stuck on that. Why? I think they could find some small tree branch, whittle a bowl shape at one end and you've got a spoon. Surely while they are sitting around in the evenings, someone could be creating some spoons. It just seemed stupid.And again, if you are creating this world, kindly explain it. WHY did the government decide love was a disease? How did this happen? To say, here is this world, but never explain anything about it, well, that feels like lazy writing. It feels like a child stamping their feet and declaring \"because I said so\" rather than crafting an intelligently thought-out society. Yes, outlawing love in general makes absolutley no sense and because of that, the author needs to sell it to me with everything she has that it does in some way make sense to the leaders of this world.There are small things that I feel were put there to make you think there is some weird sexual obsession by the government, but that goes nowhere. Example page 50: \"I hurry to the metal detector and unload my bag, then stand with arms and legs splayed while a man sweeps impassively with the wand over my breasts and between my legs.\" As I read this, I was thinking this is so ridiculous. She could have a weapon in her boot or up her sleeve or tucked in the back waistband of her pants, but as long as she doesn't shove it in her crotch or between her breasts, they'll never find it. What is so scary that they have to scan breasts and between the legs? How about simply saying \"... while a man sweeps impassively with the wand over every inch of my body.\" That would at the very least make sense and not put the message that somehow women's private areas have become the things about which safety experts are the most concerned. What is the point of saying it that way?There is also this which bugged me enough that I went back to reference it.Description of Julian: \"There is a long thin gash that runs from his eyebrow to his jaw...\"Description of Alex: \"... a scar runs from his eyebrow all the way down to his jaw.\"Hmmm. Just bothered me. Oh, well. What I liked best about the first book is completely gone from this one. First, I really thought the chapter headings being reading from The Book of SHHH and others added a lot of understanding and entertainment to the first book. None of that is in this one.Second, I applauded the fact that we didn't have a love triangle. Well, folks, I spoke too soon. As I've said, this entire book is nothing more than a set-up for the third book which is going to be all about the triangle.I also didn't care for the way the story is told in this one, with chapters titled Now and Then as the story goes back and forth between Lena's arrival in the Wilds and her life later in Brooklyn. There wasn't any reason for this, particularly as the Then portion just ends without actually linking up with the Now. And most of the Then is just about how she learns to live in the Wilds and could have really been perhaps one chapter. Again, though, if you're going to write a trilogy instead of one decent book, you've got to fill those pages somehow.The new love feels nothing so much as contrived. Yes I know there will be other readers who will say how much they love Julian and isn't he wonderful. But, in my opinion, the whole relationship feels forced. It's as if the author most of all wanted a new relationship (can't have a triangle without a new guy, after all) so she found a way to force Lena to spend time alone with a cute boy and let the longing glances begin. Really? It feels false. Or perhaps her feelings for either of these guys are nothing special as this is the first straight boy she's been alone with since Alex.And speaking of Alex, Lena just moves on. Oh, yes, she is heartbroken and woebegone, but let's face it, she forgets him in a short minute. She knows that what she's been told, that those who violate the law, aren't always immediately executed. She knows this is untrue by seeing it with her own eyes, not a rumor, not a maybe. She knows because her own mother was assumed dead, but was in fact locked up for ten years. But Lena just trips along in the forest with the notion that Alex, whom she loved and adored and who risked his life for her, is surely dead. How? She makes not even one single attempt to find out if he has somehow survived. She. Moves. On.How are you going to sell me on how much she loves him if she can't even be bothered to check and see if he's gone?And guess what? So, buckle your seat belts for love triangle #4,856,823.Seriously disappointed."}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Darlalala", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5275184-darlalala", "userReview": "[Unlike Julian who's the one who needs to be saved.

It never seems to live up to the hype? Ends up kind of sucking? Yeah... (*cough*Crossed*cough*)... I know all about it and somewhere along the way you have learned this too.I am proud to announce that Pandemonium was AMAZING, it LIVES UP TO THE HYPE, and it won't let you down at all. Such a freaking revelation. Why aren't books more like this?!The thing that saved this book from being a downer was this: the author didn't just write a straight tale where Lena gets to the wild and then keeps growing, keeps getting strong, blah blah same thing we have read about a hundred times. There is some of this in there for sure, but it's given to us in small doses, in between larger sections that are pack full of adventure and \"edge of your seat\" kind of moments. This is what made the book shine. Going between the past and the present is what saved the book from being pretty slow, and instead it makes it a book worthy of being Delirium's second book.Something I can add to this is that Delirium while it focuses on love, your first love to be specific, I thought Pandemonium focused a little bit more on hate, anger and healing. It certainly showed us a new side to Lena that we never saw before. The combination of her new life and losing Alex has made her get in touch with emotions that would have been closed up to her before, and it is very interesting to see how she manages navigates through her new life.I couldn't leave without a note on the new male interest. He is, something else. He is not going away any time soon, and sure you might hate him at first, but believe he is going to grow on you so much. Plus those sexy scenes between him and Lena certainly helped. I swear my breath literally caught on some passages. I felt like I was there, and it was happening to me.I think that anything more that I say will be too much, a revelation. I don't wanna spoil this story for you because it's a fantastic story. So just know this. If the book sucked, I would tell you flat out why, but it doesn't. It's pretty freaking amazing, and I can't believe I have to wait till 2013 to read the sequel. This is heart breaking, because the book is left on a HUGE cliff hanger that made you want to pull out your hair. I squealed. I really did, people looked at me weird, I kept doing this sort of crazy giggle. You had to be there.\nOld Update:The cover is here!Cover Revealed: Pandemonium, a Delirium novel (#2) by Lauren OliverIsn't she lovely? Isn't it beautiful? I have to read Delirium...

Those who are looking for familiar footholds in Lena's world will find themselves lost--the entire mood has shifted. This is not the hopeful side of\u00a0amor deliria nervosa we knew in Delirium,\u00a0but instead readers will be forced to endure its pain, its struggle and eventually, its loss.Lauren Oliver opens Pandemonium likening Lena's difficult journey through the Wilds to rebirth and a new life. While I can see why she chose to compare it to giving birth, I see\u00a0Pandemonium (or Pandy, as Ms. Oliver and my fellow fans like to call it) more like an ode to grief. The ending of\u00a0Delirium stunned many readers, and like Lena, I found myself crawling along trying to deal with what had happened. It didn't seem real, and Oliver doesn't expect readers to forget that loss. The Lena we follow in this book is war-torn and beaten to within an inch of her soul, and yet she is expected to pull herself together and continue to live. I think it is easy to forget that the characters in books like these are only seventeen, eighteen, barely old enough to move out, let alone fight in a revolution. And yet it is that indomitable quality, that spark of bravery that we admire so much in them.\u00a0Pandemonium forced me to consider whether I could be that brave, if I could lose everything dear to me--my friends, my family, the boy I love--and still be willing to fight for the rest of the world.And where in the world could Lena find hope after what she's gone through? The most polarizing aspect of\u00a0Pandemonium, in my opinion, will be the introduction of a new character and their connection to Lena. While I can't say much without spoiling much of the book, suffice to say that I was a whirlwind of emotion throughout much of the novel. I felt deeply for Alex in\u00a0Delirium and the new developments in this book both confused and enchanted me. After all that's happened, I find myself extremely invested in Lena, because I trust her to know the right thing to do. She alone still sees love as love, and not a weapon or a disease or an inconvenience. That unwavering faith in her heart assures me that my adoration for this series isn't going to waste, and that\u00a0Requiem will be a conclusion worth waiting for.That's Not All:> That first chapter tricked me and then made me cry. Basically, you'll need tissues for most of the novel.> Lauren Oliver's writing is even more superb in this installment. The description of the Wilds is breathtaking, despite its physical ugliness.The Final Say:\u00a0Lauren Oliver is truly a\u00a0tour de force when it comes to dystopian novels--Pandemonium will leave readers breathless and amazed once again."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4581159-jennifer", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Venezia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4867166-venezia", "userReview": "I almost had a heart attack when I saw the cover!!!! :) So beautiful! Delirium is one of my favourite books ever!!! The story and Oliver's writing... Gah I can't even explain what it did to me. I finished the whole book in one sitting which should mean something. I just pray for one thing. I'm positive that Alex is alive. I'm not sure if he'll have the cure or not. The only thing I don't want in Pandemonium is a love triangle. I'm sorry but this always kills romance for me. In my opinion someone may like another person while being in love with someone. But true love should be something unique, that can't be replaced or duplicated. I'm not sure if I could continue reading the series if somehow Lena fell in love with someone else in Pandemonium. I'd prefer Alex was dead. I know, hard thing to consider too, but I would know then that romance in Delirium wasn't killed. So, please, let true love conquer all! Let her found a male FRIEND who will not fall in love with her and save her man like every woman in love should do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EDIT: Everyone, including myself, thinks this story will eventually end with a love-triangle. I really hope that Lauren Oliver will surprise us all. Taking the road of a love-triangle is only a way to fill the holes in your plot created by the lack of your imagination.

AND IF YOU HAVEN'T, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???? Uh, I'll start this review off with what I wrote on goodreads as soon as I finished.If you thought Delirium was great you will be blown away by Pandemonium. I wish I had the next book. OMG. I want to both cry and scream right now.....Why, why, why did I read this so soon? LOLI had a feeling it was going to end like that but to actually have it happen is going to drive me nuts now since I don't have the next book.WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOWSo, that was my initial thoughts when I updated my goodreads status.Do I still feel that way? Yes, Yes, Yes. We start off in the Now part of the book. For 2 pages, than we are thrown into the Than part. Confused yet? We are reunited with Lena. She has escaped to the Wild's without Alex. Oh, I'm sure you remember that dreadful ending in Delirium and Alex is still nowhere in sight. Lena suspects he's dead even though she doesn't want to say it out loud. She imagines he's still with her and goes out on her own.She ends up being on her own for a few days until a group of others come across her and take her in, nursing her back to life. Let me tell you about my favorite characters. There is Raven, who seems to be a few years younger than Lena, but has become one of the leaders of the group and takes care of everything. Than there is Blue, who is just a little girl. I really liked Blue but she reminded Lena too much of Grace. Next up is Hunter. Hunter's a sweet guy who is friendly to Lena from the start. Than there is Tack. Tack is independent, strong willed, and tough. He always has a scowl on his face. Of course, there are many more characters but these are just a few of my favorites.Lena survives in the wild with the group for a while. She learns to get supplies, learns to wash clothes by hand, to carry water buckets, how to cook, the whole nine yards. She does what she must to survive and stay a part of their group. Than we are thrust into a whole other world. The future tense. What is happening NOW. Lena is working with Raven to take down the DFA. They are the ones who want everyone to be cured. We meet Julian right away. He is the son of the person who thinks love must be cured. He is due to have his procedure soon. Lena and Julian end up getting captured during one of the meetings and thrown in a room together. They spend days in that room, getting to know each other slowly and awkwardly. They think they have nothing in common at first except that she has been cured (she lies) and he is to be cured soon. He wants to know what it will feel like, will all temptations be taken away? Will he feel like a different person?Lena and Julian end up escaping and make their journey to find Raven and Tack. In the process, Julian is taken back by his father, and set to have his procedure. Of course Lena doesn't think its right to make him have this procedure. He should have a choice, a real choice. Well, I don't want to give away anymore spoilers. That was already a few and I didn't want to give away any! Do we ever see Alex again? Let me just say this, the information we find out about Alex and Lena's mom is insane. It was crazy intense. This whole book was so great. It was full of action, fast paced, and just a wonderful story. I wish I had the third book now. The Than and Now back and forth chapters were a little confusing at first, but I got right into it. The bad thing is, I didn't like skipping back and forth because Oliver pulls you into one than you want to know what happens in that situation, than your thrust into the other situation. I'm sure that was her point, but I was on pins and needles the whole book. (Which is a good thing HAHA) I loved Delirium and I was left crying at the end. I loved Pandemonium even more, and I was left wanting to cry but at the same time, wanting to tell her how genius she is! For all you Alex fans out there, you won't be completely disappointed however you won't be happy either. I was totally in love with Alex but throw another guy in the mix, and I'm as confused as ever. Love Triangle anyone? Overall: Oh My Gosh. I absolutely loved it. Can I marry this book? This was one of my favorite books I've read of 2011!!!Cover: Really like it.

That's what this book made me feel like. I finished it, and these were my thoughts:.........OHMIGOODNESSWHATTHEHECKJUSTHAPPENED? *head explodes*Alright, so maybe my head is still is fine condition. But that was a pretty good representation of what I felt. This book was amazing. If you loved Delirium, you are going to want to eat this one. (Apparently \"eat\" is above \"love\" on my emotional scale. I don't see anything wrong with that.)The book is told alternatively between the present and the past. Not the past-past. Noooo. That old Lena is dead. Whatever happened in Portland is gone. We have parts where Lena is in the Wilds, just newly escaped from the bordered community. And then we have the present, which involves the resistance and all those big guns. Some of it was boring, and the beginning was pretty slow. While I enjoyed reading about the homestead (that's basically a camp for the Invalids), I wanted to skip some of the snail-pace parts.Despite its slow start, this book starts fast forwarding very quickly and the words just hit you like BAM! BAM! BAM! (I'm sorry, but I'm finding a hard time describing this book.) Every single word was a twist in my heart. You have no idea (until you've read this book) how Lauren Oliver has the ability to hold your very heart in your hand and stretch it to her will. Kind of a scary image, yes, but kind of the best I can give you. Her writing is beautiful and descriptive, and kind of just flows over you like water. There were parts that left me breathless and all adrenaline-filled, like I just ran a marathon. I was pretty much on the edge of my seat the entire time. (That was a metaphor; the majority of it was read while lying in bed like the lazy person I am.)And the ending. I don't know how much of it you have heard about, but I will not ruin it for you, because I am a nice person. But WOOOOOOW. After I read that last word, I just kinda of stared at the book with my mouth open. And then my dad made me go to bed, but I kind of just lay in bed for a few hours, thinking. And staring at the dark ceiling. Honestly, 2013 cannot get here any faster.My thoughts? Read. This. Book. While it has a dystopian-ish feel, this book is definitely all about the romance, which Oliver does beautifully. You should definitely read it.

One, I wanted to jump inside the book and throw Alex over the fence; second, I practically cried and pushed Lena into the woods. It was tragic like Romeo and Juliet, and I can't wait for Pandemonium. But watch this happen...Lena is living on her own in the Wilds, having a good time and feeling free. And she meets some guy and he becomes her first real friend while she's there and he helps her learn the ropes (What ALEX would've done if he were there)and she'd start falling in love with him and getting over Alex, who she still cares about.Meanwhile, without Lena or anyone knowing, Alex is being held in the Crypts or something. Waiting there...thinking of Lena everyday...praying she's alright...while she's off with someone else. And somehow Alex breaks free (Maybe -just maybe- Lena's mom comes back to save him. VERY FAR FETCHED POSSIBILITY HERE!!!) And him (and her mom?) make some huge grand entrance into the Wilds, to find Lena in a very...awkward position with the other guy. Alex is outraged and he storms off and Lena's shocked that he's alive and she is torn between the two guys and, ta da, the classical love triangle. If that happens, I won't be surprised, but I personally love Alex, and if it were me, I wouldn't stop thinking about him at all. He sacrificed freedom for Lena (Possibly his life, depending on whether he's really dead or not)and I don't think I could ever forget him.

She was taken in by a group of resisters led by Raven, a girl just a few years older than her. From Raven, Lena learned all she had to know: the way of living and surviving, but most especially forgetting the past.The Now chapters, taking place in New York, told the story of the new Lena. Magdalena Ella Haloway is dead, and in her place is Lena Morgan Jones. Enrolled in a new school and living a new life and identity, Lena was given the task to enter the world of the DFA, the Deliria-Free America, an organization promoting the cure with its leaders standing as role models to its people. As the Resistance\u2019s eyes and ears, Lena was told to watch Julian Fineman, the DFA\u2019s youth chapter president and son of Thomas Fineman, president of the organization.You would see two very different Lenas in the book. In the Then chapters, Lena was like a new-born in the Wilds, learning everything from scratch. To her, she was reborn in pain and agony, having nothing but herself. Alex was not able to cross the fence with her, and now all that\u2019s left of their love were her dreams of him. He was but a phantom haunting her every turn. There were times that Lena wished she never met Alex and that they never attempted to escape, but she knew very well that this was what Alex wanted for her: the freedom to live and to love, to have a choice. Lena and her new group, her new family, have gone through so much. It took great energy and perseverance for them to relocate when needed, and receiving supplies from the other side was risky. Lena\u2019s new life was never easy.This set of chapters made me cry. When I first read this installment last year, it wasn\u2019t this painful. I was feeling twice the ache that I felt before. It was as if I\u2019m reading this series with a new, but fragile, heart. The walls inside me were crushing down for Lena in every scene that she mentioned Alex. You could really feel her loss; like in crossing to the other side she left her heart in Alex\u2019s hands, leaving a deep, dark hole in her chest. Lena was an empty well. All that she carried with her were the echoes of the past.The Now chapters, which occurred a few months later, shows a braver Lena. She had become very different from who she was, as if she had shed skins like a serpent and been reborn like a Phoenix. She was now at the stage wherein she was almost unbreakable, ready to conquer new challenges and threats she would face, because she had nothing to lose anymore.Lena is a character that\u2019s constantly changing. Every page I turn showed me more of her and who she could be. I could say that this installment made me look up to her. She was a broken glass. She may not be whole anymore, but she has become something dangerous.I want to discuss the new characters in this book and there are a lot of them, so I just chose the two very important ones.First is Raven. Raven was born within the borders, but she escaped to the Wilds when she was fifteen. Her personality is strong and very mature for her age. She always knew what to do. I think I never saw her panic. Even in her grief, she was thinking of everyone\u2019s best chance. She was very selfless and I love how patient she was with everyone. Sometimes she could seem rude, hurting Lena through her words, but she was just doing what she thought was good for her. Raven was always there for everyone even at times that Lena thought she would abandon her.I really like Raven. I honestly think that she\u2019s like a mother bird taking care of her nest, warming her eggs cradled in it. Her name suits her very much. Like the birds in the forests, she was always ready to move whenever danger was approaching, or fight when they are caught in the middle of one.Now, I\u2019d like to talk about Julian Fineman. Julian was a bit similar to the old Lena in Portland. He was na\u00efve and believed in the cure but, unlike Lena, he was very curious to the illegal, although something happened to him that made him want to forget about the urge of learning these things. Julian was eighteen years old, but still uncured. He had brain surgeries when he was younger due to a cancer he had, and being cured could kill him. Still, he believed that he had to undergo it even if it could cost him his life. Finally, he was given a schedule to go through the procedure and all the people are anticipating it. Julian was a symbol for the people to look up to, and if this operation would end him, he will be treated as a martyr, a hero.Maybe you\u2019re thinking \u201cBut Alex is so much better than Julian.\u201d Hold your tongue my friend. Let me explain to you why Julian is loveable as well. First, his character wasn\u2019t flat like Alex\u2019s in Delirium. Alex was a whole being, and Julian was just starting to find pieces of himself. I saw how he was changing throughout the book. I delight in how he was towards Lena, how he was distant at first, but at the same time obviously curious. He had a lot to learn and I liked that, through him, Lena was able to share with him her knowledge. It was now Lena\u2019s turn to save someone from her old world. I saw a bigger and better Lena at times that Julian had to rely on her. My feminist side is very glad with the idea that Julian is the one in need of rescuing. With him, Lena was almost invincible, not because of Julian, but because she just was.Julian and Lena\u2019s relationship was a healing process, especially to Lena. Two lost people found a home in each other when they had no one else. Lena and Julian were patching up each other, filling up the space that they were holding inside themselves. But looking from Lena\u2019s side of things, I could say that it was pretty impulsive. Julian was the first boy she felt attracted to since Alex was gone, and it is possible that she was just overwhelmed by her grief, clinging to the possibility of a new love. Her budding relationship with Julian lacked the genuine feelings that she shared with Alex. It maybe swoon-worthy, but deep down I know that it\u2019s pretty unhealthy. In this sequel, readers will also meet new groups of people. First, the Resistance, the group that Lena now belonged to, which was organized, cunning, and established with a purpose: to take down the government and fight those that promote the cure. They live through strategies, a family scattered in different corners. The resistance is ivy, slowly taking root and spreading. Next are the Scavengers. They are almost similar to the resistant Invalids: uncured. But the thing about them is that they take no sides. They live to destroy and to steal, but you could easily buy their loyalty.Underground, there is also this group of deformed people. They live in hiding to protect themselves from the Zombies, the cured. Most of them were considered as Deliria babies. It was believed that children produced out of love are infected, some of them having abnormal features. Aboveground, they could be executed immediately after birth to prevent the spread of the disease.Pandemonium lets readers explore the bigger picture of Lena\u2019s world. Every corner has its own story to tell, a whisper in the wind that you would have to carefully listen to.The ending was so perfect and gut-wrenching. It was a hullabaloo you would not want to miss. If you\u2019ve read Delirium and decided not to continue with the series anymore, rectify that mistake and pick this up. I promise you that you would not regret it. I bet you my book-boyfriends! I felt like screaming out my lungs when I finished it. I felt shocked and exhausted that I had to process my feelings for a while. Lena wanted the freedom to choose; now she got it, and it\u2019s mind-boggling. If I were her I would have had a panic attack. It was a blessing and a curse to be caught up in that situation.If there\u2019s one thing that I learned from Pandemonium, it was that pain is not the end but the beginning, and in the darkest of nights, you\u2019ll find the stars brightest.Overall, obviously, I highly recommend this. Please do pick this up. You have to."}, {"userName": "Beatriz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46560610-beatriz", "userReview": "Reto #33 PopSugar 2017: Un libro situado en dos per\u00edodos de tiempo diferentes\nUna novela pausada y muy intimista, que me gust\u00f3 mucho m\u00e1s que Delirium, la primera entrega de esta trilog\u00eda, que le\u00ed hace m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o y\u2026 eso fue un error.

Wow, what a book. My heart started beating double time from the first page until the last. And, again, a HUGE cliff hanger. First, I'll address what I didn't like about this book. Each chapter is entitled either Then or Now. It goes back and forth between the past and present. Normally I might not mind this so much but the entire book is so darn intense. Each chapter has so much going on and since you are dealing with two different times and each one has huge events happening that you are freaking out trying to deal with both scenarios at the same time. I though my mind was going to implode. Lena has gotten over the fence and she runs. She runs, walks, and crawls through the forest of the Wilds until finally someone finds her and nurses her back to health. Not only is she weak and sick from her escape, she is grieving for Alex. She is told that he didn't make it, that he was killed during the escape. So the book swings back and forth from her time in the Wilds, introducing you to Raven, the leader of the little group in the Wilds, and to the present time when she and Raven and another member of their group, Tack, are in New York, with fake identities, as members of the resistance. As I said before, from page one, you are on the edge of your seat. Lauren Oliver has such a way of making me feel everything. Lena's grief for Alex was so real to me. I was overwhelmed with sadness for her. And, Lena is so brave. She acts first, thinks later. I am so proud of her. I literally could not rest until I finished the final page. But now, with the cliff hanger, I have to get right on starting the final book.

If you picked up the beautiful special edition of Delirium you got the first chapter of Pandemonium. The first few chapters for me were akin with a horrible break-up. It is heart-wrenching to watch Lena in this state. Like Delirium there is few significant characters introduced and its wonderful! I love when I pick up a book and don't have to remember the name of every single person in region *cough* Twilight Saga *cough* The complete anonymity of everyone but Lena a handful of secondary characters forces you to focus solely on Lena's voice.

I will try to be as vague as possible with details, but if you do not want spoilers- please don't read this!I have a theory. You see, I just finished Pandemonium ten minutes ago and couldn't stop thinking about it. I NEEDED to get my thoughts down on paper. This doesn't happen very often with book reviews. My theory is this: the Delirium trilogy is similar to a puzzle. In the first book, Lena is docile, weak, and meek. In this book, Lena is the exact opposite- hard, cold, and most of all ... angry. You can see this in the covers to the books- in the first, the colors are blue. The model is wide eyed and innocent looking. On the cover for Pandemonium- the model is fierce, picking the reader apart with her angry glare. The colors are orange, red, and the plants give the model a wild look to her. Some may find this off-putting. Lena's personality seems to have made a complete 180 degree turn. But if you look at the big picture (and if my theory is correct), you can't look at one book without the other. This trilogy seems to be Lena's path to becoming a complete person. A person who has a balance of strong with weak, passion with common sense, and calmness with ferocity. A complete person. Delirium and Pandemonium are those complete opposites- and I really believe book three will be the book that ties them together.As for the book itself, Lauren Oliver did a fantastic job! At first, I was bothered with how different Lena seemed since the last book (understandably so, but still?). About halfway through the book, I realized- Lena still doesn't have it figured out yet. She will, but she is still struggling to find a balance between the \"wild\" and the \"order\" in herself.Yes, there is a second love interest, and yes he is important, but I don't really think that that is what Pandemonium is really about. Pandemonium is more about Lena's journey and how far into \"wild\" she is willing to go.I hope you will all read this book when it comes out- and when you do get a chance to read it, hop back here and let me know if you agree with me. I, personally, can't wait for the third book.

More like a warrior-resistance fighter, trained assassine kind of girl than the student whose biggest revolution was to sneack out of the house to go to a party. Maybe it was that factor that turned the book into a hunger games kind of book and it felt wierd to me to read it.
