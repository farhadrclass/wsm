I knew from the very first page that I would like it, the author's style was so unique, the premise so strange and surreal... but I just couldn't get into it. Actually, no, I could get into it - at first. I read the first 35% in one sitting. But then when I picked it back up there was nothing to keep me drawn in. My main issue was that it was so gosh darn confusing. I'm never sure who's perspective I'm following, where or whom Cole is, and it bounces around everywhere. I found myself reading and re-reading the same passages over and over just trying to make sense of them. I couldn't relate to Cole. I got so tired of her constantly ignoring Candace for no reason. I couldn't understand why she wouldn't trust her, she just kept saying \"I can't trust her, she could be lying\" as if that was enough for us to go on. After hundreds of pages of Cole getting visions, confusing the heck out of me, then yelling that the visions weren't real and Candace was lying to her, I decided to give up. I really want answers but the narrator is too unreliable and too unrelatable to give them to me. However, the author's style is sublime. The worldbuilding seems incredibly well handled and I'm still really wanting to read more to get those answers. I just can't stand Cole, so I can't. It's just not a book for me."}, {"userName": "Amanda Williams", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14568025-amanda-williams", "userReview": "I love the premise of this book and I feel the storyline is amazing and I loved the characters. However, I have a few small issues that prevent me from giving it any more stars. In my opinion whilst reading it I felt dis-attached from the storyline. Sometimes I had to read a passage a few times in order to understand what is going on. The writing to me feels older than what the intended audience is. I am not saying it is a bad book, far from it. I really enjoyed reading it. I do however feel as if it needs tightening up a little. I would however still be interested in reading what else this author has written."}, {"userName": "Bobbi Wagner", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59956486-bobbi-wagner", "userReview": "This is my first book by this author, I highly suggest reading it. I enjoyed how she took a paranormal story and add some humor to it among a few other things. I also enjoyed the different characters and the journey of twists and turns they took me on. This book is about hopes and dreams and things not being as they seem. About secrets being exposed that could change things. The characters come alive in nightmares and fight to survive in them. They kept the story engaging and reading."}, {"userName": "Tanya", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28956778-tanya", "userReview": "3.5 stars-This book is a great idea- the world is interesting and although the beginning is really confusing, it clears up after a bit. The writing is great and the characters are intriguing- except for Cole. I really dislike the main character and I don't think she smartens up enough for me. Sadly, this colors everything. But if you like the main character, you will LOVE this book. I was still happy to read until the end"}, {"userName": "Milian Glafira", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67479318-milian-glafira", "userReview": "Not my usual type of read but very enjoyable!Dont read this book if you easily get nightmares.....Its a twisty story that makes you stay up all night to finish it.Liked it very much and can't wait to see more from this author!"}, {"userName": "A_MOTUS", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56152116-a-motus", "userReview": "Complicated, mysterious and kind of creepy.

But when one girl learns her society's absolute control and guarantee of safety are both illusions, she risks her hard-won status, her home and her life to rebel and expose its lies.When haunted teen Cole discovers the state's guarantee of safety from the nightmarish Mara in exchange for obedience is a fraud, she realizes hers isn't the only life at stake. Cole needs allies to help her escape execution by nightmare and expose the lies. Now, with a ghost at her back, enforcers in pursuit, and a charismatic rebel leader gaslighting her, Cole must figure out who to trust to bring down the state and stop the dying before the nightmares eat her alive.A YA dark fantasy about identity, trauma & taking back your choices. Ghosts and world-monsters in post-eco-disaster Vancouver.Detailed synopsis:Seventeen-year-old Cole hides a forbidden obsession with death from both the repressive, authoritarian Refuge and Cadence, the ghost who haunts her. Cole\u2019s determined to shake her reputation as a failure, but when she spectacularly fails her probation trials and uncovers the dark lies at the heart of Refuge, her world crumbles around her.Fleeing, she finds an ally in the charismatic leader of the glittering, permissive underground club and rebel enclave modeled after the seven colour halls of Poe's The Masque of the Red Death, Freedom. Ravel offers the chance to bring down Refuge's regime - along with a tantalizingly hedonistic new way of life. But as Cole struggles to fit in and meet Ravel\u2019s expectations, she finds herself drawn into visions of death - and to the silver-shrouded boy who fights back, a boy Cadence claims to remember from her former life. In the waking world, Ravel seems less interested in toppling the Tower and more focused on transforming Cole into his ideal consort - and people are dying in more than just Cole\u2019s visions.To stop the dying and put an end to Refuge's lies, Cole will have to own the hidden power within and choose once and for all who to trust and what to be: an obedient drone, a hedonistic goddess, a solitary hero\u2026 or something else entirely.Ebook, audiobook and print editions coming in Spring 2018.", "title": "Blind the Eyes (Threads of Dreams #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39077719-blind-the-eyes", "average": 3.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520469384l/39077719.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16944344.K_A_Wiggins", "name": "K.A.
