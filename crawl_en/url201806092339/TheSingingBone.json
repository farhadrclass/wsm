Almost like the young boy Stuart, the reader watches the story of Alice and her friends as they become family to Jack Wyck, a convicted killer. The stories twist, pile on top of one another, switching between characters at will to give another perspective. From past to present we see the terrors of Mr. Wyck's home, we watch from the perspective of a documentary filmmaker, from the eyes of Alice a once 17 year old caught up in the romance, and from the eyes of Stuart the young brother of one of the girls. As a reader it's almost like you have ingested the drugs right alongside the characters, it's unsettling, it's disjointed, and it creeps into your mind and plants a seed. I'm not sure any characters were made to be likable, even in 1999 as an adult Alice is odd, a professor of folklore, and unable to face her past. I instantly pictured her, I understood how her life had become folklore itself, how she couldn't separate realities from fantasies. Then there's Jack Wyck, Mr. Wyck, a character not unlike Charles Manson. Through drugs, sex, and companionship he offers four misguided youths a home, a place to get away, but also a place to conform them to his ways. He changes their views, brainwashes them, and uses them in his schemes. From lies to get money and random children's clothing, it is obvious that Mr. Wyck is a bad man. What Beth Hahn does well in her writing though, is allow you to feel like Alice and see how easy it was to get caught up. She watches from the fringe, taking it in but not involved. Her youth is different than the others, her brain and innocence a draw to Mr. Wyck, and when she does step in it seems things start to fall apart even more. I love that she never accepted it all, even though she was just as caught up in it as the others. It's just like we've all been told, there's seduction involved in the cult-following, it's romanticized to the point that the characters feel like this is okay. I enjoyed The Singing Bone far more than I expected to. I actually avoided it at first, it didn't feel like I was in the mood to read it, but once I started I couldn't stop. I loved the investigative filmmaker, his outside perspective at the current Wyckian followers, at Alice and her untold truths, and at Jack Wyck himself. I enjoyed the tales, ever changing, and always sinister. While it is incredibly slow moving, I found myself searching for any moment in the day to pick it up, to find out what was next. I loved the development, the writing style, and how the story wraps itself in the end, just like a folklore tale."}, {"userName": "Nicki", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8862640-nicki", "userReview": "A convicted killer`s imminent parole forces a woman to confront the nightmarish past she has spent twenty years escaping.Have you ever read a book that really pulls you in even though you can't explain why?,I felt like that about this book.The story is not action packed or have any plot twists but it is very creepy and has an air of menace,you know something bad is going to happen,you just don't know or to who.The story flips back and forth between 1979 when Alice and her friends Molly,Stover and Trina are drawn into Jack Wyck`s evil cult and 1999 when Wyck is trying to get his murder conviction overturned and has a new band of followers,one of which is intimidating Alice because his group feel that Alice is a traitor for testifying against Wyck in the original trial.Also adding to Alice's problems is an acclaimed filmmaker who is making a documentary about Jack Wyck and events that occurred while Alice and her friends were living at Wyck`s house,a film that could uncover secrets that Alice would prefer to stay hidden.Jack Wyck is a truly evil,manipulative character and it is chilling how easy it is for him to slowly brainwash Alice and her friends and get them to do what he tells them and turn them against each other.Also it was chilling that there were youngsters that worshipped him,helped him intimidate Alice and believed he was innocent,it just goes to show how much power people like Jack Wyck have over people who are willing to believe,the story reminded me of the Charles Manson case from the late 60s.I did feel quite a bit if sympathy for young Alice who I think was only looking for the love that she didn't get at home and was easily taking in by Jack Wyck`s charm.The book has an open ending,could there be a sequel planned?,that would be interesting.It is Very well written,mixing folk lore,the culture of the 70s,cults,drugs,sex and the frightening fallibility of youth.This is Beth Hahn`s debut book and I will be very interested to know what she is going to follow it with because this is going to be a hard one to beat.

It reads like a dark, rich tapestry, with all the characters' stories looping together in startling, satisfying ways. Once I was fully \"hooked\" (give it a few chapters--it WILL hook you), I found myself wanting to speed through the book simply to find out what happens next, but then was constantly forced to slow down to appreciate the language. Beth Hahn's sentences have more in common with verse than prose--often so stark and graceful that they read like little mathematical proofs. A talent like this writing a thriller? It's like a dream. She has her own distinct minimalist style, which seems unusual in any popular novel these days, let alone a semi-genre novel like this one. She doesn't overwrite with MFA-ese; she's economical, discerning. She knows equally what to add and what to (tantalizingly) leave out. As for the story, what can I say? It'll rock you. It's haunting, fun, dangerous, intelligent, sexy. All the best things. A ghost story dressed in gypsy beads and set to Zeppelin. Savor this one.

It all falls apart one fateful evening as several horrific acts of murder bring about the end of their mind-controlled, drug-filled life with Jack Wyck. The story toggles back and forth between the events leading up to that night in 1979 and 20 years later when filmaker Hans Loomis decides to make a documentary about the case as new DNA evidence that threatens to clear Wyck is produced.Our main character, Alice, was the smart one in high school prior to becoming acquainted with Mr. Wyck. I found her character, as well as a few of the others, to be one dimensional and somewhat stereotyped. As her character devolved into someone completely out of touch with reality, I found the story becoming less and less believable. Her miraculous recovery (though she continued to have some convenient amnesia) and seamless transition into a professor of folklore was a package too neatly delivered for me.There were also parts of the story I would have liked to hear more about. Where did all those clothes in the closet come from? Who did necklace did Alice found belong to? What was Wyck's connection to all of the other missing teenagers? It would have been interesting if bodies connecting Wyck to those disappearances could have been found.

Where did it go??? It was AWESOME!!! This book cover looks more generic. The description sounded exciting- suspenseful - and uniquely fresh. The title of this novel had me very intrigued also.Even though it took me awhile to finally read this novel ( having 20 + others to read with archive due dates)...I was so excited when I sat down to begin \"The Singing Bone\". I had a gut -hunch from the start, that this was going to be terrific.And then...I was so darn confused in the beginning...(I wanted to put the book down-play on Goodreads and grab an apple). The story pick up, no longer confusing, but my enthusiasm dropped a notch. At one point Alice dreamed of singing on the streets in California...( she wouldn't have to endure another cold New York winter). Alice is dreaming to 'dress like a hippie'. Her friend Tina is dreaming to get 'fucked up' and listen to Pink Floyd.Oh boy...I began to ask myself...\"I'm reading this book, why?\" I never was interested in rebelling against my parents....(with a dad who had already died by the age of 4 and a mother working full time),.....living in a small white-wall- apt., I dreamed for a 'family' experience and all that went with it. I wanted all those things I saw people rejecting. I grew up in Berkeley, California ...so it wasn't as if I wasn't surrounded by street people, drugs which I never did, and flower power-beauties catching rides to the Monterey jazz festivals. ( ok, I went to the music festival one year myself)....but I didn't dream of being a hippie. I wouldn't have known how to do it anyway. ( I might be better at it today).....*kidding*! So... About THIS story: The teens in this story were everything I wasn't...yet, still familiar. Impressive teens in 'aw' of danger... which is perfect because Mr. Dangerous has these kids under his spell.

This was far better than I expected. I bought this as one of those cheapo ebook deals which meant that I hardly spent any money on it (if any at all). Usually, this is a kind of hit-or-miss situation with a strong lean towards the \"miss\" side, but from time to time I am lucky and actually manage to buy a decent book!Well, putting my stingy book shopping habits aside: The Singing Bone is a well-written book about the notorious tale of the psychopathic cult leader and his devoted-up-to-a-very-unhealthy-point followers. The seventies are almost over, when 17-year-old Alice Pearson and her small group of childhood friends fall under the spell of the seemingly enigmatic, but actually just narcissist criminal Jack Wyck and his two companions. The friend's original doubts about Mr. Wyck are soon forgotten after a load of drugs, parties, drugs, sex, drugs, some fake religious/ philosophical mumbo jumbo and yes: drugs! And voil\u00e0: Mr. Wyck has his followers or as he likes to call them his \"animals\"! The story takes it turn and will only come as a shock to you if you have never heard of the Manson family before and what they did to Sharon Tate and her friends.Beth Hahn tells the story from a variety of different perspectives which help to give the storytelling a new spin: mainly, through the eyes of Alice 20 years after her stint as a Wyckian cult member, and then through Hans, a filmmaker who is trying to make a documentary about Jack Wyck, now incarcerated, the cult he represented and his vice-like grip on young people, many of whom still see him as a great leader. Even though each narrative is rather slow-paced and even though you'll have a pretty good idea how at least one storyline's going to end, this book manages to lure you into its darkness and makes you want to carry on reading way past your bedtime.Only the ending left me a bit wanting: just a few questions unanswered.

It reads more like a coming-of-age story, if you grew up real fast with a brutal cult leader and had lots of drug-fueled sexcapades with all your friends. The events of the past are laid out from the start, and the only thing that is not clear is the extent of the violence, and the culpability of Alice, a surviving member. There were some indications that this was going to be a thriller, with creepy cult wannabes lurking around every corner and a filmmaker living with death threats, but that came to nothing. In the end, it turned out to be a very well written novel about a girl who gets sucked into a cult and tries to come to grips with it as an adult. There's nothing wrong with that, and I don't wish to discourage anyone from reading it, but I've read this story so many times already. I didn't enjoy the many descriptions of cult life at all. It seems that all fictional cult leaders (and possibly real ones too) are surprisingly unimaginative and happy to do a half-hearted Manson routine; sex, drugs, murder; rinse, repeat. In the unlikely event I ever find myself leading a cult, there will be a wide range of activities to suit everybody and to avoid boredom.

Draw your own conclusions as to why, at this particular point in history, I'm drawn to stories about charismatic sociopaths who attract the weak and vulnerable and lead them to tragedy and ruin, but here we are. I've read a couple lately and comparisons are inevitable. The Singing Bone delivered in places where The Girls fell slightly short, for me: tension-building, mystery, and a visceral view of the characters' unraveling that made the horror simultaneously chilling, tragic, and comprehensible. The writing is elegant and the story layered with elements of folklore and legends. The biggest surprise came on the acknowledgments page, when I discovered the author is the daughter of the Queen of kidlit horror, Mary Downing Hahn. Well.

If you read or were drawn to Emma Cline's The Girls but you wanted more (plot, action, character, third person narration) then this might be more your cup of tea. Hahn takes on the Manson story (parable? cautionary tale?) and grafts it on to the late 70s, switches coast lines, replaces the dessert ranch with a lush forest, takes out the celebrity infatuation and offers much more insight into the psychology of the women who fall for a dangerous conman. I imagine Cline's press sucked up all the air around stories about Manson-esque cults because I can't recall reading or hearing anything about this novel and indeed only discovered it via a search for \"cults\" on Hoopla.

It's the last(?) in a string of books I've recently read that explore how an antisocial or disturbed influence at the wrong time can under the right circumstances produce chaos and violence, and how ripe the teenage female psyche is to be both prey, and predator. By the final third of this book, I felt so attached to the characters that at times I was truly scared to read on, knowing that the core four teenagers, who have known each other since infancy and love each other in a heartbreakingly ordinary, realistic way, would all meet isolated tragic ends (for half the group: death, and the other half: ruined adulthood).

Over the next six months, a series of increasingly disturbing events occur. Only one of the teenagers, Alice, returns home, though she\u2019s anything but free.When the wider world discovers what happened in the farmhouse, Mr. Wyck earns the nickname Bogey Jack, and over the next twenty years, he becomes the stuff of urban legend. He\u2019s the reason kids are afraid to play in the woods, and the reason their parents won\u2019t let them. But even behind bars, he attracts new followers: a group who call themselves the Wyckians.In 1999, Alice has a new life as a professor of folk law and hopes never to revisit her time in the house of Bogey Jack. However, work sees her settled at a college nearby the old farm house. As the twenty-year anniversary of Mr. Wyck\u2019s arrest and his impending release draw near, Alice attracts the attention of a documentary film crew and the sinister leader of the Wyckians, and it\u2019s not long before the secrets of the past begin to stir.The Singing Bone is a sinister, slow-burning thriller, and a seriously impressive debut.It\u2019s also exactly my kind of book: cultish, claustrophobic and spooky as all get out. And the rural New York setting? BONUS! I absolutely devoured this novel.The story shifts between 1978-9 and 1999. The reader experiences the 70s chapters mostly through Alice\u2019s eyes while the 90s narrative is split between Alice, Hans Loomis (the documentary maker) and Stuart (the younger brother of Molly, one of the teenagers who didn\u2019t make it out of the house). As such, the story unfolds slowly. It opens with Hans, who\u2019s trying to decipher between truth and legend to figure out what really happened in the farmhouse. Then the reader meets two versions of Alice: the innocent seventeen-year-old and the haunted woman living under a false name. In the early stages of the story, there\u2019s a chilling juxtaposition between the enchantment of Alice\u2019s early days at the farmhouse and the shadow her time there ultimately casts over her life. Then we get Stuart\u2019s perspective: what he remembers about Alice and her friends when they were young and what he observed when he sneaked into the house. The truth is constantly shifting and distorting.The Singing Bone takes its title from a folk song/story of the same name, which Alice is researching. In the Grimm version:\"A brother kills a brother so that he might marry the king\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s only later that the younger brother\u2019s bones are turned into a horn that tells the story of his death, and then the murderer is stitched into a sack and thrown in the river.\"However, there are many versions of the tale, all equally valid. Indeed, it\u2019s no coincidence that Alice\u2019s work, like the story she inhabits is:\"\u2026Rich in shifting narratives, half-truths, magical revelations. Hidden keys that open impossible worlds are not unfamiliar to her.\"And here\u2019s the thing: Alice doesn\u2019t remember much of what happened at the farmhouse, particularly towards the end. The anniversary agitates her memory, but there are so many versions of what happened\u2014so many ways of looking at it\u2014she can no longer be sure what\u2019s true. As in her work, she has to piece together all the versions to find the facts. It\u2019s very gothic.At the centre of all these shifting narrative fragments is the enchanter, Mr. Wyck. The reader never hears from him directly, and so he remains Other: shimmering somewhere between man and myth. There are very few physical descriptions of him in the book, and those that Hahn includes tend to focus on his tattoos\u2014images he\u2019s laid over his skin (yes, I\u2019m kicking myself for not noting them down).All this truth/illusion, shifting perspectives stuff gets me giddy. It\u2019s Totally my bag. I also loved the story\u2019s unhurried pace. Hahn gives her reader plenty of room to get a feel for what life is like in Mr. Wyck\u2019s house. But throughout the summer, when it\u2019s still all free love, pot and parties, there\u2019s an ominous sense of foreboding. Little by little, Arcadia falls apart.So, yes, I loved this book. But there were a few points that niggled. I understood why Alice and her friends felt they couldn\u2019t leave the house, but I didn\u2019t really get why they went there in the first place. Ostensibly, one of Alice\u2019s friends, Trina, is dating a friend of Mr. Wyck\u2019s who already lives in the house. But when Trina introduces her friends to Mr. Wyck and his existing housemates, Allegra and Lee, it\u2019s suddenly: Whelp, I guess we all live all here now.Four teenagers move into the house: Alice, Molly, Trina and Stover. With the exception of Alice, who\u2019s seventeen, the others are eighteen but still in high school. As you might expect, their parents aren\u2019t well pleased when the kids skip out to go live in a hippie farmhouse owned by a guy in his thirties. They worry a lot. But their efforts to get the kids back? Kinda lacklustre.Now, in this next bit, I\u2019m not going to give away anything too explicit, but I am going to discuss the ending. Becuase Feelings. If you\u2019re planning to read this one, I suggest you scroll down two paragraphs.***HERE BE SPOILERS***The ending was dissatisfying. I was waiting for a climax or confrontation that never materialised. With Mr. Wyck\u2019s impending release from prison, the Wyckians returning to the house for the anniversary, their hooded leader spooking Alice, Hans gathering material for his documentary on the murders, and Stuart coming back on the scene, it felt like trouble brewing. But the tension just fizzed out.To be fair, there is a revelation of sorts, but it\u2019s one of those awkward twists that leaves you blinking at the page like \u2018\u2026was I not supposed to have figured that out yet?\u2019 Maybe Hahn does want readers to join the dots, but even if that\u2019s the case, there aren\u2019t really any consequences that follow from the revelation. Okay, I\u2019m headed deep into spoiler country: Scroll. Away. Now. Alice *does* get closure, but I didn\u2019t feel she\u2019d earned it. One of the big questions of the book is: who is responsible for the major crime? And I felt Alice should shoulder more blame than Hahn attributes her. Not all of it, or even most of it, but a share. Wyck\u2019s agent or no, what she does is horrific, and the idea that she could ever really be free of that doesn\u2019t ring true, especially when the other characters all pay such a high price. So while Alice finds closure, I didn\u2019t, AND I WANT MY CATHARSIS, GODDAMMIT!!!\u2026Annnnnnd welcome back to the spoiler-free zone.Those points aside, The Singing Bone was everything I wanted in a book. It\u2019s a grim tale about the ways in which the malicious prey on the innocent, how quickly individuals submit to the will of the group and how willing people are to believe illusion over truth. It\u2019s sinister, creepy and darkly compelling.Thank you to Regan Arts for providing a copy of The Singing Bone in exchange for an honest review.Get Lectito reviews delivered to your inbox or visit Lectito to see what else I've been reading."}, {"userName": "Tara B", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20705747-tara-b", "userReview": "This book ends with a lot of story still unfinished. You want more when you finish which is how a book should be. I enjoyed this book and feel that the way the story is told is very comfortable. Moving back and forth from the time of the crimes back to modern day gives you several perspectives on what was actually happening. You can not deny the Charlie Manson references that are heavily throughout the story however there is some solid variation and some twists and turns. I would for sure recommend this to people that enjoy a well written enjoyable crime story."}, {"userName": "Michael W Dawson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52131149-michael-w-dawson", "userReview": "RivetingThis was a confusing story to start but was very hard to put down lots of twists and turns lots of feelings for those kids.

It begins with Hans, a controversial documentary filmmaker, who receives a package from a mysterious, legendary inmate, serving a sentence of 25 years to life: Jack Wyck. Hans\u2019s previous film exposed cults and cult leaders and provoked a deadly violent episode at its inaugural screening, and Hans begins to research Jack Wyck\u2019s story with great trepidation. When Hans contacts Alice, a professor of folklore, he unleashes ghosts that Alice has kept at bay for decades. As a teenager, Alice became entranced by the charismatic figure of Jack Wyck. At the time, Alice was inseparable from her friends, each finding refuge from dysfunctional homes, through their friendship with each other, except for Molly, whose parents and whose younger brother, Stuart, adored her and worried about her, and who is ultimately brutally punished for this. Jack Wyck usurped the love these friends had for each other, manipulated it, used it and abused it. In his words: \u201cWhen you put a collar on an animal, you can\u2019t just walk up to it the first time you see it and put a collar on it. The animal has to trust you first. It has to know it is your friend. And you approach from the side, not straight on. There has to be a relationship. You should never use sheer force. By the time it happens, it\u2019s almost a celebration. It\u2019s a shared trust. It\u2019s a bond\u2014not servitude.\u201dNow, with new evidence, Jack Wyck may be freed from jail, and it is Alice he blames for his imprisonment. Beth Hahn deftly weaves past and present with multiple points of view, as the truth eludes everyone who searches for it, or declares ownership of it. Hans\u2019s story, his filmmaking process, ideas about narrative, and his observations of events and people, becomes almost a stand-in for the writer and the reader, seeking truth and coherence. Stuart, whose integrity and compassion hold the narrative together, provides this coherence, honoring his (and by extension, the reader\u2019s) memories and refusing to succumb to hatred."}, {"userName": "Lolly K Dandeneau", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau", "userReview": "\"He uses people up until there's nothing left.\"What I enjoyed most about this book is the exploration of the slow easy seduction a cult-like leader makes. Naturally, the mind wanders to memories of criminal Charles Manson and his own little 'family'- that had to be said. 17 teen year old Alice is the 'intelligent one' among her friends, earning her the nickname Genie from the magnetic conman Jack Wyck. It isn't long before she is just as mesmerized by the mysterious man as her friends are. With a back and forth between past and present we know a horrific crime has taken place and that Wyck is prison for it many years later. But what we don't know is just how involved Alice and her friends were. Set at the tail end of the 70's, it is still an experimental time for drugs and fading hippy ideas of love and community. What's mine is mine you yours and his... and his...and his... Spending days of lazing about and pondering the deeper things in life, casting away their parent's ways of seeing the world, loving each other in all ways physical and open becomes nightmarish as things turn dark and downright evil. The reader knows Alice is the traitor that helped lock Jack away, and now someone is looking to tell his side of the story. Step into the future and Alice has made a life for herself, as a professor of folklore- no one knows about her tie to the long ago crime. The story of the Twa Sisters has become a meaningful tale to her in her folklore studies, but why? Who is the killer of the tale, what does it all mean and why is this story so deeply rooted in the crime?This story is twisted and the mystical web Wyck spins to justify his way of seeing the world and the things he does will trap Alice and her friends forever. No one will be left unscathed by their encounter with Jack. But just who is the real criminal here?"}, {"userName": "Lavender", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21643172-lavender", "userReview": "This was a dark and suspenseful read. The story is told very slow, you get to know all the characters and the author also gives us some time to understand how and why these four bright young people fell for Jack Wyck. It\u2019s still hard to understand but I almost got it. It\u2019s also a book about friendship and guilt and forgiveness. Alice, Molly, Trina and Stover are close friends since they very kids. Trina somehow comes along with a new boyfriend, Lee, and Jack and Allegra, two adults. Jack is almost twice their age. It\u2019 1979 and Jack and Allegra seems so different to the average people in their small home town. With the help of drugs, alcohol and sex they caught their interest and soon the four move into his filthy house in the woods, were they pretend to be a \u201cfamily\u201d. Jack is charismatic and offers a strange philosophy. But it all ended in a nightmare.The story springs back and forth between 1979 and 1999. Alice is now a professor of folklore. Hans, a documentary film maker wants to make a film about Jack Wyck, who is still in prison. Hans contacts Alice, and soon she has to make up with her past and her part in the murders that happened. The book takes its time. The story develops slowly. Little by little you learn what happened, who was killed and who did it. It\u2019s a very dark and complex story. It\u2019s frightening and also, at the end, hopeful. I enjoyed this book, Maybe it was a bit too slow and too long. But I admire the great story, it\u2019s development. I am glad I got a chance to read this exceptional book..

Has anyone seen The Following with Kevin Bacon? Well let me tell ya, if you like this book, you'll love that show. Have you ever read anything about Charles Manson or any other cult novel? This book is no different. Now don't get me wrong- I love a good cult story, but something has to really stand out or be outrageously different from all the others for me to LOVE it. The folklore theme was something I was really interested in reading about, but the author didn't delve much into it. This was my second attempt at reading a 2016 published novel by a new author. So far,  Girl Through Glass takes the cake.

Alice is the main character and we learn of her past as she herself confronts it through the probing eyes of a documentary film maker. Past and present converge as Alice's story unfolds and becomes more surreal. The threads are held together by the \"murder ballad\" folklore songs that Alice, now a professor, studies and preserves, and that also haunt her.

Once it got going it was worth a read. Jack Wyck is basically a Charles Manson type who is able to manipulate a group of teens into participating in sex, drugs, fraud, and a murder spree. We are told the story through flashbacks that begin when the teens still had \"normal\" lives.

In the meantime, she and her three closest friends spend their time listening to Led Zeppelin, avoiding their dysfunctional families, and getting high in the nearby woods. Then they meet the enigmatic Jack Wyck, who lives in the rambling old farmhouse across the reservoir. Enticed by his quasi-mystical philosophy and the promise of a constant party, Alice and her friends join Mr. Wyck's small group of devoted followers. But once in his thrall, their heady, freewheeling idyll takes an increasingly sinister turn, and Alice finds herself crossing psychological and moral boundaries that erode her hold on reality. When Mr. Wyck's grand scheme goes wrong, culminating in a night of horrific murders, Alice's already crumbling world falls into chaos, and she barely makes her way back to normal life. Twenty years later, Alice has created a quiet life for herself as a professor of folklore, but an acclaimed filmmaker threatens to expose her secret past when he begins making a documentary about Jack Wyck's crimes and the cult-like following that he continues to attract even from his prison cell. Jack Wyck has never forgiven Alice for testifying against him, and as he plots to overturn his conviction and regain his freedom, she is forced to confront the long suppressed memories of what happened to her in the farmhouse\u2014and her complicity in the evil around her.The Singing Bone is a spellbinding examination of guilt, innocence, and the fallibility of memory. Weaving together folklore, seventies-era anxiety about sex, drugs, and cults, and dominated by the indelibly menacing Jack Wyck, this richly imagined novel heralds the arrival of a remarkable new voice in literary mystery.", "title": "The Singing Bone", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25986942-the-singing-bone", "average": 3.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451935757l/25986942.jpg", "reviews": 116, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14204059.Beth_Hahn", "name": "Beth  Hahn"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Suspense", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25986942-the-singing-bone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274285-the-singing-bone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28919017-the-singing-bone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29378674-the-singing-bone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39650360-elucidations", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
