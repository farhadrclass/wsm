No one ever accused him of subtlety, but Car loses whatever traction he gained in the right direction with Karate. I notice that in Classic Crews, this and The Gypsy\u2019s Curse are included in full so I am forced to capitulate that what I quite profoundly like about the author is not what the majority of other readers do. Hand to Rod (Stewart): I\u2019m no contrarian and find people who go against popular opinion just to differentiate themselves\u2014and for no reason more\u2014to be fucking annoying. But in the case of Crews, I politely disagree with the consensus. For me, when he\u2019s drawing from a different well than the bullshit \u2018Grit-Lit\u2019 genre (who comes up with these names?), his efforts are far more substantial\u2014in some instances, in fact, they are sublime.Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t one of them. Sure, it\u2019s an entertaining satire of America\u2019s obsession with fame and the absolutely insane lengths people will go to to obtain it (like, eh, eat a car), but I found myself just cringing at the obviousness of the whole thing. Plus, I aim to be more than just entertained: that\u2019s what raising cats for meat is for. Crews was a legendary drinkist and druggist, so I\u2019m going to chalk this one up to his beloved morphine and booze getting the upper hand. Car's tit jokes and thinness seems like something he could\u2019ve knocked out in a single day; it\u2019s that bereft of substantiality. (But, again, it looks like I\u2019m in the minority here, so take the caveat that I\u2019m largely a humorless shit to heart. If you could see me, my eyeliner and 14-holes alone would tell you that I\u2019m a very serious young man that knows that this world is a vale of tears best obscured behind deadly angular black bangs. And no, I\u2019m not crying\u2014I have smoke in my eyes from my cloves. For your information, I cry from two-to four PM, seven days a week\u2014 barring, of course, the days that Mom/Bitch makes me peanut butter and banana sandwiches with the crusts cut-off and arranged into an alternating series of pentagrams and upside crosses.)"}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh", "userReview": "(3.5) I've read: three fiction (now), one non-fiction and one biography about/by Harry.One can say I enjoy his writing and his crazy life. This is Crews at his satirical prime. America's arrogance and consumerism kills is the theme in this absurd anecdote. With his usual cringe-worthy theatrics towards the end, I'd say this is one that will entertain the Crews amateur and enthusiast alike."}, {"userName": "Graham P", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3924545-graham-p", "userReview": "This short novel occupies the spaces between JG Ballard's 'Crash', Paddy Chayefsky's 'Network' and an episode of 'The Waltons'. A disturbing, heartbreaking examination of car culture and fame. When the youngest of the Auto Town family decides that he's going to eat a Ford Maverick, inch by inch, consumerism and capitalism come knocking hard. 'Car' has the usual mix of Crews explicit and surreal material--balls-out and blue collar eloquent. If only the book were longer. And only Crews could have a character describing dedication of craft with the art of fellatio. They don't write shit like this anymore."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/230339-sara", "userReview": "a simple compact story that bends your mind. Crews has a way of making the unexpected weirdness packed full of subtle heartbreak, as well as good old fashioned raw tension. A good book to grab and take out on the town: put it in your back pocket, bring a jacket, then take the book to coffee, on a bus, and finish it at a small bar that you never go to."}, {"userName": "Kirstie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/700282-kirstie", "userReview": "So I felt I had to search for this after work today after my friend Zachary rated in 5/5 stars. I found it at Myopic Books and was able to read it in a single workout, which definitely was one factor in it receiving only 4/5 stars...I tend to prefer my novels less like novellas and more like deliberate literary developments where I can grow attached to the characters over a period of time. 600 pages is about perfect for me, with 900-1,000 pages being an extra special value. I mean, have you ever noticed that most used book stores charge the same amount for a 200 page book as for a 1,000 page one? Where's the value in that? I don't like a Hershey kiss as much as a rich and delicious truffle I'll savor in all my memories!I digress with my venting, which happens when I'm tired. In any case, this novel is mainly about the American psyche and the American dream. It is a little bit about sex and a little bit about cars and family but to deduce it to that would be to miss the point. In some ways, it is about a family that has worked hard all of their lives and longs for this sense of financial assurance but there's this other idea is that the car is where all of the important things for Americans happen...the car is America (no one is trying to eat a bicycle in this book incidentally...made me wonder if anyone has tried...another night, Google!) In any case, it's a grand delusion that if you love the idea and the sense of the car that much your body won't reject it. Our main hero eats quite a bit of one until he really begins to suffer. And I think, in a sense, this is what contorted dreams and materialism does to any person living in America...it eats away at you from the inside and what was once so attractive becomes painful and a little indigestible too. Let's not forget..the car may be where, as one character suggests 10% of babies are conceived but it's also the place where people lose their lives, where bloody wrecks that ruin bodies and stop those from breathing occur. If there's an allure to the Cadillac here and a nod to the idea that the environment of a car is the perfect place to \"respect a woman\" there's also a nod to the fact that a car wreck can leave you dead or deformed, gasping for your last breath, and screaming your last words. In many ways, a car is just a microcosm of America itself, a joy ride and a devourer of dreams both. And, of course, sometimes the American dream, brand spanking new off the lot has a real problem: it squeaks.I thought it was interesting that Crews made a parallel with the man who loves cars with a woman who works as a prostitute...he's so focused on cars that he can't engage her in the intimacy she offers and she's so engaged in this intimacy that she can't reach him on his car level (but again, it's just a symbol or a metaphor for the overarching sense of America and history imo)So, I think Crews does well with making these points and capturing a certain point in time in America as well. We feel a certain sympathy for the family involved, the brother, sister, and father of this hopeless dreamer who thinks eating a car is a pretty good idea to make something of himself. And he also captures a certain vileness of the audience watching our hero Herman devour the car, though I felt that even for 1972, using racist slurs and calling children with cognitive disabilities idiots was a bit too vicious (of course, I am quite sensitive to these things.) In any case, he gets his ideas across and well enough that I'm interested in reading other works, especially longer ones that I can delve into properly.Memorable quotespg. 8 \"Women were emotional and full of gestures\"pg. 19 \"...he thought everybody must be able to look at him and tell he had raised a son who was going to eat a car. It weighed heavily on his conscience.\"pg. 49 \"I only know that I refuse to have my life measured out in cars,\" cried Herman, choking on the knowledge of some awful truth that he could not say, \"Goddam cars are measuring me! Me! Don't you see we're on the wrong end?\"pg. 50-51 \"He solemnly opened his mouth as though about to take upon his tongue a sacrament, but instead his pink lolling tongue lapped out of his mouth and touched the hood of the Maverick car. It was clean and cold and he felt himself tighten around his stomach. He longed to have it in his mouth. To feel it in his throat. To hold it in his stomach. It would amaze the world. \"pg. 73-74 \"Filled with terror and joy, he tried to wake up. But he was not asleep. His eyes filled with cars. They raced and competed in every muscle and fiber. Dune buggies raced over the California sands of his feet; sturdy jeeps with four-wheel drive and snow tires climbed the Montana mountains of his hips; golden convertibles, sleek and topless, purred through the Arizona sun of his left arm; angry taxis, dirty and functional and knowledgeable, fought for survival in the New York City of his head.\" (I thought this was a brilliant nod to Coleridge:) pg. 74 \"Cars cars everywhere and no place to drive.\"pg. 75 \"Tell me about it, darling Herman. And then you'll see it's only a dream...\"\"I was full of cars.\"\"Full of...\" \"They were in my arms and legs and head, my blood, my heart.\"\"Well, a dream,\" she said, trying to soothe him\"Then I was a car.\"pg. 151 \"They went under the arch, she leading him, under the mountain. It wasn't really a tunnel at all. It was just a long series of accidental open spaces.\""}, {"userName": "Luk\u00e1\u0161 Pal\u00e1n", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9742157-luk-pal-n", "userReview": "Jako spr\u00e1vnej mana\u017eer sem si to dobuchtil do Levnejch knih a jak jsem vid\u011bl tenhle fl\u00e1k za 49K\u010d, vyt\u00e1hl jsem z kapsy litr a nechal si p\u011bkn\u011b vr\u00e1tit 951 K\u010d, abych m\u011bl drobn\u00fd na tramvaj.

It read like a cartoon in its absurdity, but it certainly wasn't for kids. It was so funny, but while laughing at the cartoon, there was something earnestly, heartbreakingly real about it. Remember, the car kills. Many may romanticize a joy ride, but no one thinks they'll die in a car wreck. And so America is a Cadillac. No matter how perfect it seems, it's not perfect. It never will be. And people are going to get hurt when they fall for it and eat it up like cake. Love this quote: \"And I think because I love it so much, I can't stand for it to cause that kind of pain in me. I mean I can stand the pain - I think I could stand the pain if it was just pain - but I can't stand that kind of pain from something I love.\"So good.This isn't Harry Crews best.

But the issue I had with Car wasn't its somewhat overly satirical plot, or its less-than-memorable lines - it was that the characters, who were well written and interesting, were dealt such short shrift after grabbing hold of you. If this book had been twice as long, Crews still couldn't have fulfilled the promise that he set out in the opening pages of seeing these characters expanded and understood.
