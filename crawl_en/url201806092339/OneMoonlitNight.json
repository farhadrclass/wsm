Reading the plot outline is just a beginning, but you have to be willing to inhabit the mind and body of a 10 year old boy to really get a sense of the brilliance of this author. The Welsh people seem to be born with poetry in their marrow. This has been compared with Dylan Thomas' Under Milkwood, but for my part, I associated it strongly with How Green Was My Valley. The last two chapters threw this childhood tale into an entirely different realm, and I may be sorting those scenes out for a while. But a worthy read for those not afraid to work for their literary understanding. If I can ever make sense of the book's conclusion, I may change my four star rating to five.My favorite line: The unnamed narrator and his best friend Huw are discussing their possible futures as clergymen. \"But I don't want to be Godly. I just want to be good\"."}, {"userName": "Philip Mitchell", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4192629-philip-mitchell", "userReview": "As the English translator of this book, I'm probably more than a little biased in my appraisal. That having been said, I remain firmly of the opinion that this is one of the greatest novels ever written.For some few readers who lack all heart, all soul, all imagination and all compassion for their fellow men and women, this book will appear to be no more than some boring Welsh bloke going on and on about his boring childhood in boring Wales.For many, many others, however, it's a mind-blowing, life-changing, world-shaking experience akin to being allowed for several hours to stare into the face of God. It will change your life.\"One Moonlit Night\" has been likened to Dylan Thomas's \"Under Milk Wood\" but such similarities as may exist are superficial. Dylan Thomas was a wonderful writer and one of Britain's most eloquent and engaging storytellers. I love his work - but did he bleed his heart and his soul into the pages he wrote? On the whole, I think not.Prichard was also a wonderful writer but, unlike Thomas whose heart lies interred in the earth and whose soul is in Heaven (hopefully), Prichard's entire being, his entire life-force, his heart, his soul, his mind, his everything are contained - alive and vibrant - within the narrative of this book.Prichard worked feverishly, eating and drinking very little while writing the book and, as soon as it was finished, he retired to bed for several days and nights. Such was the drain on his resources.Read it as soon as you can and, if possible, pay for it.I need the money. ;)"}, {"userName": "Bert", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5870798-bert", "userReview": "Weird, skeevy books like this need to be kept alive and celebrated. This feels not quite like any other book, and well, i think that's something. It does do the whole horror of the adult world seen through the eyes of an innocent child thing, which has become horribly tacky, but it did it a long time ago and with a uniquely Welsh valleys lilt; folkloric, unsettling, also endearing. It is a narrative about bearing witness - the kid sees everything, the everydayness of poverty, insanity, death, and adultery in the village, but he also sings a bunch of church hymns, picks berries with his mates, and eats a shitload of bread and butter. It is lots of things at once, but by the end it's the old-world religious fervour and the brooding gothicness that was there the whole time but you never noticed, that really sticks. A great, bewildering novel."}, {"userName": "Aleksandra P.

Why won\u2019t you let Huw come out to play, O Queen of the Black Lake?\"Half-fictional memories of a long-gone childhood are commonplace enough \u2013 but not when they are so hauntingly rooted in landscape, language, and incipient madness as they are in One Moonlit Night. It is an astonishing book. A dreamscape that inextricably melds together the pignut-hunting, hymn-singing, game-playing, bread-and-butter-eating memories of a boy in a Welsh slate-mining village in the time of the Great War with the suicides, adulteries, perversions, violence, and deaths that accompany them. The recurring phrase \u201cIt was a moonlit night just like tonight\u201d only emphasizes the dreamlike quality of the novel \u2013 wonderfully translated from the Welsh by Philip Mitchell. Much of it is actually very funny, though often in a dark sort of way. The old Welsh fondness for identifying people by their trade, residence, and family connexion rather than by their surnames leads to one of the narrator\u2019s childhood schoolfriends being called Little Will Policeman, the policeman himself being called Little Will Policeman\u2019s Dad \u2013 though this is not quite so long-winded as Emyr, Little Owen the Coal\u2019s Big Brother, one of the book\u2019s more disturbing characters. And then there\u2019s the narrator\u2019s Mam, destined for the asylum \u2013 and the mad dichotomy between Brenhines y Llyn Du, the Queen of the Black Lake, and Brenhines yr Wyddfa, the Queen of Snowdon. Are all the villagers creatures of the Black Lake called up one moonlit night? Dew, it\u2019s an odd book this one.

It's not a great book, but it's close to be one. The things I was expecting to find in The Life of Rebecca Jones were here.While in Rebecca, excepting two pages or three, things described could have happened anywhere in a rural setting in the western world, One Moonlit Night is completely Welsh. Everything - geography, language, people, religion - is as Welsh as it can get. I have traveled to the region were the story is set (and Rebecca is set, too), and I can easily relate to it.The story is a first-person narrative, the life in the village told by the eyes of a boy around 10 years old (the books is not very chronological, but it seems to span about three, four years of time). His father is dead and he lives with his mother. As he tells his story, he sees everything with the eyes of a child (the author is very successful in this), the good and the bad - he tells us about a game of football, then a suicide, then he getting lost in the valleys, the chase of a rapist, etc. His feelings and reactions are very well done.From the very first pages I was confident One Moonlit Night was going to be at least good. It keeps going in a good pace, without many ups and downs, in fact without any really dramatic change to the story. Sometimes you could take, let's say, the tenth chapter and change it with the fourth and it won't make that much difference, until the last chapters.I won't spoil anything, but in the chapter before the last there is an incident that is basically the description of something that really happened to the author. It's very credible. But, unfortunately, in the last chapter there is a situation that doesn't seem credible - a conclusion that doesn't seem to fit with the character. Maybe some people will like it, but for me it was like another person writing the ending, or as if Prichard had no idea how to end - maybe he didn't want to tell what really happened to him, going to London to work, maybe he thought it was too banal - and decided to create something a bit exagerated. But this something is not satisfactory imho.Even so, I think the book is essential to anyone that enjoys or want to know about Wales and Welsh literature. But it's not universal - if you don't care about Wales, I couldn't say the book is a necessary reading (even tough it can be fully enjoyed).Four stars - for the strenght of the narrative, the minutiae of rural life, a good rythm that never gets boring, even though the ending seems to follow Chandler's advice - \"When in Doubt Have a Man Come Through a Door with a Gun in His Hand\"."}, {"userName": "Gill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2208255-gill", "userReview": "This is a 4-5 in places, but I found the end part less comprehensible and a bit unsatisfactory. Philip Mitchell has, I believe, captured the essence of the book magnificently in his English-language translation. The language is both evocative and beautiful at times, but Caradog Prichard's intention to write it as 'a radio play for voices' like Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood detracts from its impact for me, because it does not match Dylan Thomas's powerful use of language to drive meaning, but sounds like an echo of such works as Thomas's. One does not get such strong impressions of character as Dylan Thomas draws with his superb and innovative use of language, and the subject matter lacks the joy of such characterisation. Instead the grim realities of a childhood lived in poverty and with deprivation, the frequent deaths, the overwhelming religiosity of the community, and the gradual descent into madness of many of its inhabitants are difficult to read about.  Perhaps I do the book an injustice, and should make an attempt to read it in its original Welsh, but the translator has been clear about his attempt to be faithful to the meaning and sound and function of the language Prichard used. I fear I should remain rather disappointed at the end."}, {"userName": "Huda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9514172-huda", "userReview": "Sometimes I get dreams where some terrible things might happen, and I may be devastated or horrified in it, but I soldier on to the end of all that because in dreams, there's a certain floating quality about things, so you could see bits of a nightmare here and there, but overall, the dream felt right--normal even. I'm not sure if I'm the only one who dreams this way, but One Moonlit Night felt exactly like that. Narrative in this English translation threw me off a little, and I had to get used to name system--identifying other characters based on their designation (ie. Price the School because he was a teacher)-- and things can get a little disjointed when we're following the main character, but it grows on you after a while. At the end of it, I felt like the narrative was certainly the bigger charm of the book. Religion played throughout the book like the higher power that it is. The characters are driven by their religion, and it pretty much governed their lives. There are some pretty heavy things going on in this book, but I felt like I waltzed through it anyway.

Most of it is the childhood/teenager memories of the narrator, a boy growing up in a poor Welsh village surrounded by all kinds of things a child should not have to witness, told in a disarmingly frank tone of voice. Interspersed with that are some chapters of odd, mystic-type poetry which doesn't make logical sense but seems to echo with the story's events. Now I read somewhere (was it in the Afterword?) that all of this story is a run-up to the narrator himself going mad, as his mother did, but I don't know. The ending is too ambiguous for me to be certain whether he did lose his mind or whether he was just very, very sad. But the book is not all doom and gloom.

It's narrated from the view point of a small boy in most parts, telling of his care-free adventures with Huw and Moi.

Originally published in 1961, this Welsh-language novel has been eloquently translated into English by Philip Mitchell, perhaps garnering Prichard the wide recognition his novels have long enjoyed in his native land. Less a novel than a loosely connected series of tales, Prichard peoples his fictional world with characters such as Grace Ellen Shoe Shop, Will Starch Collar, and Johnny Beer Barrel. Though One Moonlit Night has its lighter moments, its story is primarily a sad one: the narrator's mother is sent to an insane asylum; one close friend dies of tuberculosis while another moves away; village men die in the faraway killing fields of the war as the loved ones they leave behind live in unrelenting poverty. Eventually, something terrible happens.  In One Moonlit Night, perfection is in the details--the loving evocations of the townspeople and the physical and emotional landscapes they inhabit. Dark as it is at times, Prichard's tragic tale is leavened by humor and illuminated by prose that is lyrical and deeply stirring.", "title": "One Moonlit Night", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1113669.One_Moonlit_Night", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340716244l/1113669.jpg", "reviews": 42, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/549015.Caradog_Prichard", "name": "Caradog Prichard"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Classics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1113669.One_Moonlit_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4285452-one-moonlit-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34663816-jedna-ksi-ycowa-noc", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25785165-one-moonlit-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2548119.One_Moonlit_Night_Un_Nos_Ola_Leuad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3701785-one-moonlit-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20662158-afal-drwg-adda", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17287626-y-genod-yn-ein-bywyd", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34109887-llef-un-yn-llefain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21843405-canu-cynnar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21843402-tantalus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
