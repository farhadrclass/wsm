If it was, that's even worse. Elaborating on this would be disclosing too much... Both Katya and Marcus Kidder were pretty unsympathetic characters in my opinion. Their relationship was disturbing, based soley on manipulation. But the novel was interesting. I thought the book was really well written. JCO is a very good writer; this is far from my first meeting with Oates. I find that with Oates it's sometimes meat, sometimes bone, but always well written, thougtful, clear prose. There are books by JCO that I've read several times, and then one in particular that I disliked so much that I left it on an airplane. I would say that I liked this book, but I'm glad it was a short, b/c otherwise I'd have felt differently."}, {"userName": "Naksed", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29458352-naksed", "userReview": "Part Lolita, part Blue-Beard, Joyce Carol Oates'A Fair Maiden is a beautifully written, bleak little tale where the line between reality and dream, or rather nightmare, dissolves to the point that by the end of the novel, you are left wondering if the entire thing was not just some figment of the main character's imagination or perhaps wholly lived inside a mind that has totally disassociated itself from consciousness.We meet 16 year old Katya, a working-class girl whose shady New Jersey family is as warm and nurturing as those hundreds of jellyfish that periodically wash ashore on the beaches of the exclusive, Jersey shore enclave where the teenager has found a summer job nannying for a wealthy family. Though Katya is surrounded by glamour and glitz, she keeps thinking of her own relatives who are more akin to those slimy little sea creatures, with their half-alive, transparent tendrils quivering with venom. So when Marcus Kidder, a bastion of society, a man of old money, money that was invisible, the money of true wealth, begins to pay her attention, and then begins to actually pay her to pose for him, she is equally repulsed and flattered by the white-haired, sixty-eight year old. Though she sees all the signs of impending danger, his slick, black, limousine following her ominously around town like a great white shark in pursuit of his small prey, the way that she feels exhausted after posing for her portrait for hours, as if he is sucking the life out of her, all those portraits of young girls and women decorating his house like a morbid gallery of trophies, she can't help being lured back again and again, like she has been hypnotized. And she really has been, in a way, since all she has ever wanted in her entire life of abuse and neglect was to find one person who feels she is special, she is beloved and belonging, and here is this old guy telling her she is his soul mate, his muse, and a person of importance. I really enjoyed the writing even as I was creeped out and depressed by the author's very negative, cynical, point of view. On a windy day, old Marcus Kidder's big, wild, tuft of patrician, white hair looked as if it were being roughly caressed by agitated hands. Katya's gaudy mother wears pale frosted pink-bronze lipstick that, thickly layered on her mouth, looked like an extra skin while her breasts feel like balloons filled with warm water. A hated piece of red, lace, lingerie is crumpled up and kicked into a corner of the whitely gleaming, resplendent bathroom...where like a wounded creature it seemed to huddle.I thought the parallel to Humbert Humbert was too facile, down to Marcus' mysterious little girl who died of a tragic illness decades before and who seemed to have fueled his obsession with beautiful \"nymphets.\" I was also left confused with two important developments in the plot, which other readers seem to have taken literally, but which I strongly believe to be sort of like dream sequences, if not complete hallucination brought on by deep trauma. I am talking about the scene where she believes Kidder has drugged and raped her. The way it is written, I was left wondering if she is not instead re-living the very real rape she suffered at an even younger age by her thug \"cousin\" and which she seemed to have completely repressed and dismissed in her conscious state. The other scene is the concluding scene where she very uncharacteristically abandons her charges, the two children she has nannied and come to love over the summer, and is whisked away to Kidder's mansion, greeted by the housekeeper who behaves in completely opposite fashion to reality as sometimes people do in our dreams and she then assists Kidder in his assisted suicide, as he had wished for her to do. Though I enjoyed the very, creepy Charles Perrault fairy tale vibe of this tale, and the visual, rich writing, as well as all the wry observations on gender and socio-economic disparities as observed through the eyes of an old before her time, downtrodden, teenager, overall, I could not say that I loved or even liked A Fair Maiden though I could absolutely see how someone could fall in love with this book and with the author'style. It was simply not original enough and at the same time too dark for me, in the end."}, {"userName": "Allison Floyd", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/805686-allison-floyd", "userReview": "Bleak! But what'd I expect? After all, Joyce Carol Oates is not Maeve Binchy. She sure knows her way around invoking an atmosphere, though. The themes here are pretty worn around the edges, for Oates and for literature in general. Nevertheless, you find yourself rooting for Katya, and genuinely grieving for her, and hoping that everything will be all right-- although, this being JCO, you know that's not bloody likely. The end becomes pretty predictable pretty quickly. It's just as well that this is a novella, since it frankly felt quite long enough as is. Also! Here commences the \"toxic authors\" shelf, wherein I gently remind myself to partake lightly (if at all) of said author's other endeavors, lest the bleach-drinking--oft-threatened (promised?), never-delivered--actually occur. Call me shallow, call me a wuss, but darn it, my inner landscape is cluttered with enough sad detritus as it is. And while I admire you, JCO, for creating in the pages of this book a powerful scene/image that will take its place there, I say \"Uncle!\" to the relentlessly depressive.Maybe that's why I'm more drawn to T.V. these days.

Abused in various ways since childhood, the heroine also lost her father early on. She is unknowingly on a quest, interacting with men, attempting to evaluate and measure their reactions and actions toward her, allowing them to define her and her identification with the world. She seeks answers to these questions: what is abuse, what is love, and how much control over her own life does she really have? Her slight interactions with women serve to reinforce her already confused ideas about herself and relationships.

Fairy tale references are scattered throughout the book like breadcrumbs. We meet sixteen-year-old blond, tan-legged Katya (aka Cinderella or Snow White), who is working as a nanny for the rich Engelhardts on a New Jersey beach. She doesn't have an evil stepmother, but she does have a mother who prefers gambling and drinking to paying attention to her children. Enter Marcus Kidder (aka Prince Charming/Big Bad Wolf). Yes, I intended to put that slash there. But Kidder isn't the young raven-haired prince of Disney movies. He isn't young at all, or raven-haired- he is a sixty-eight year old man who's very attracted to Katya. And so our story begins with the push and pull page-turning suspense that Oates executes so well. Mr. Kidder wants Katya to model for him (he's an artist), and of course, as in any Oates story, or any story worth reading, for that matter, things get...complicated. On top of that we have her cousin Roy in the picture. He just got out of jail. One thing I've always liked about Oates is her ability to blend in the character moods with nature imagery- clouds splitting the sky precedes a character's frown. Her sentences are spare, yet punch you with their poetry. And of course, there's her incredible talent for suspense. Although Katya and Mr. Kidder are superbly developed, I felt like the rest of the characters were caricatures. The Engelhardts are greedy, suspicious, and spoiled- because that's just how rich people who have summer homes on the beach are, right? And I have yet to read an Oates story where a teenage/twenty-something male isn't pure evil- nothing more but a violent rapist/ex-prisoner with addiction problems. Such is the case with Roy. In fact, it's always been somewhat of a surprise to me that Oates' male characters have always been so two-dimensional, considering she's such a great writer. As for the ending- I guess it worked, but I closed the book feeling kind of...dead. And sad. Not the sweet kind of sadness that succeeds a Hardy or Bronte novel, but a kind of icky sad. Also, there are certain mysteries in the novel that go unanswered- I couldn't figure out if that was intentional, or if Oates just didn't feel like dealing with those plot lines (in which case, why put them there?). Oh well. Still a recommend.PS- For anyone familiar with Oates's short stories, this story seemed to be, in a lot of ways, a reworking of one of my favorite Oates stories called \"The Model.\""}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4585892-anne", "userReview": "I read some of the other reviews before writing mine. I haven't read many of JCO's previous novels or short stories so I didn't know what to expect from this book. I read it as an adult fairy tale. I felt for Katya, a girl who had so little experience of beauty for its own sake that she had no context in which to place Mr. Kidder or his world, hence her amabivalence and the rolling of the dice theme. Certainly she had no experience of being loved or appreciated simply for the fact that she was worth love and appreciation; her mother, her extended family had never given her that and her father, who did, disappeared from her life. In Mr. Kidder's home she sees all the lovely fossil flowers and portraits, hears his beautiful music and wonders Why? What is the purpose? For surely nothing is done without some practical gain. What's in it for me? is the world from which she comes.Mr. Kidder, on the other hand, on the cusp of death, wants to leave his beautiful world in the most beautiful and romantic way possible. He does manipulate Katya and occassionally does come across as a little creepy, but mysterious, too, but I read it more as a man who is truly in love with this young girl, but unable to reach across or down into the class, the life, from which she has emerged briefly, to coincide with his life.I cried at the ending of this book, and imagined Katya inheriting Mr. Kidder's fortune, leaving Vineland,NJ behind, taking speech lessons to get rid of that Jersey shore accent JCO commented upon, and becoming the Princess she wanted to be in her heart of hearts.As I said, a fairy tale."}, {"userName": "Valerie McCoy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3442459-valerie-mccoy", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates. . .Can I ask you what you were thinking?This is probably one of the WORST (again, I repeat, WORST) books I've ever read. Oh, and believe me, I've read my fair share of terrible books. The main character, Katya Spivak, is portrayed as a 16 year old girl who has gone through an unbelievably tough adolescence. Now, if Katya were as broken and tainted as the author would like us, the readers, to believe. . .I daresay that she would never given Mr. Kidder, another character around whom the book centralizes, the time of day. Instead, Ms. Oates uses Katya to take us down a path of confusion and (yes, I'll admit) some intrigue. A few more characters are introduced throughout the entire course of the book; one of my least favorites would be Roy, the criminal cousin. Katya's mother, who is another least favorite, even warns her that Roy is asking about her and for Katya to stay away from him. Now, in this book there are a few scenes of abuse. Let's not beat around the bush. . .Rape. Instead of showing rape for what it really is: a terrible, scaring, life-altering experience that steals away parts of the victim, Ms. Oates uses it as a \"creative writing device\". Katya is raped twice: once by the infamous Mr. Kidder and then once by her cousin, Roy. Ms. Oates uses Katya's background as a foreshadowing of the end. For in the end, Katya is just as, if not far more, ruined than at the beginning of the book. Yes, this book is \"creepy\", in the sense of Edgar Allen Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne, but in no way is this book worth a second read."}, {"userName": "Sunny Shore", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124341-sunny-shore", "userReview": "I usually love everything Joyce Carol Oates writes, but this was one of her lesser efforts. She is such a prolific writer....she pretty much lands on the bullseye with most books....but with such a large body of work, she's bound to miss once in awhile. I listened to the 5 CDs of this sad tale of a Jersey teen who gets in over her head with an old rich man, while being a nanny for a family at the Jersey shore. It's all been done before and we hear every thought in Katia's pretty little mind, whether they are good or evil. It is typical JCO in that she always brings us to the edge of situations where we will definitely...squirm. I like that part, but this is just a rerun of the same old stuff we've seen over and over many times before: poor girl, bad home life, nobody cares, vulnerable for trouble....."}, {"userName": "Felicity", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1251313-felicity", "userReview": "This might be a good book, but I really didn't like it. Joyce Carol Oates can certainly write which is a lot more than can be said about a number of both the good and bad books I've read in the past year. But reading about female victimization, framed in the manner that it is in this book, brings me no joy. Yes, Katya does use her sexuality as a tool of exploitation too. But that's because it's all she knows how to do. And, she's fifteen. It's the responsibility of the adults around Katya to protect her, not to exploit her in the many ways that they do. The story is just miserable, but not even in a kind of heart-wrenching way. It's just plain, pure ugly...not something I wanted to open a book and read about right now."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "I found A Fair Maiden on a discount table at Chapter's, and remembering how I cried while reading We Were The Mulvaneys, I decided I'd give Joyce Carol Oates another read. In the end, I'm not certain this slim novella is a fair follow-up to my previous experience with the author, but reading some reviews here, perhaps it is.Right from the beginning, when Katya meets Marcus Kidder and he asks, \"What would you choose if you had your wish?\", the teenage girl feels like she's being drawn into a fairytale. The fairytale elements continue until, abruptly, the old man tells her the fable of the Fair Maiden and his intentions become explicit. I don't know if I understand why the author decided to stop the allusions and force the plot in this way, but just as it interrupted the flow of the story for me, it also seemed to break the spell for Katya and she reverts to her former self; the lower class partygirl, so desperate for love and attention, that she offers herself up to her rough and abusive cousin in order to feel human connections. That with remorse she returns to fulfill her destiny with Mr. Kidder rings true with both Katya's own sense of compassion and the requirements of a sort of \"happily ever after\" ending.I remember reading a conversation on facebook once where a young mother was lamenting that as much as she wanted to read classic fairytales to her kids, she found it challenging to sanitise them as she went along because they were far too violent and scary. Her friends agreed, this editing is something each of them did, and one of them remarked that she couldn't even show her kids Disney's The Little Mermaid because it was too violent. This is where I itched to jump in, to say that I hadn't let my girls see that movie when they were little because it had been too sanitised. When I read the original Hans Christian Anderson tale, I was struck by the commonsense moral it was trying to impart: a woman should not change herself, give up what is important to her (neither her inherent gifts or her family), for the love of a man. That's a powerful message, one that likely doesn't get through to women in love, and it's a message that Disney totally removed from their version of the story. The last thing I wanted imprinted on my little girls' minds was that they, like Ariel, could give up everything, literally give up their voices, and that would lead to happily ever after. I wanted to tell these young mothers that fairytales have survived all these years for a reason; not despite the violence and fear mongering but because they must satisfy a basic human psychological need. In the end I didn't intrude upon the conversation, just watched it, bemused, as though through a magic mirror.In this modern fairytale, Oates updated some archetypes for her characters. Like Cinderella, Katya has been abandoned by her father to be raised by a mother and siblings who don't seem to care much about her welfare. In Bayhead Harbor, she wistfully gazes at the castle-like homes and imagines what it would be like to live in one.( I was intrigued when, in the fairytale within the book, it said that the Fair Maiden was raised by her grandmother. I was waiting for it to be revealed that Katya was actually the daughter of one of her sisters left in the care of what was her grandmother, but whom she had been told was her mother, explaining her apparent neglect, but that never came out. Still, I wonder if that's the assumption we are meant to make.) Katya keeps assuming that someday her Dad will come back to her, that like Hansel and Gretel's father, he didn't leave on purpose. And Marcus Kidder is a wolf in sheep's clothing, literally, when he removes his \"snow white\" wig to reveal a monster underneath. I was intrigued by the inclusion of crystal meth in this book as it dovetails with some of my reading this year. I must be na\u00efve, but I just don't see meth around me. But, watching Breaking Bad on Netflix and reading books like Beautiful Boy A Father's Journey through His Son's Meth Addiction and Tweak Growing Up On Methamphetamines, I am told that it is everywhere around me and destroying lives and families. As Tina Fey said in a prayer for her daughter in Bossypants:  When the Crystal Meth is offered, May she remember the parents who cut her grapes in half and stick with Beer. This is a prayer I've never thought to say-- could this be the greatest danger my kids will have to face? Is this the real moral of this story? I also recently watched the movie \"Winter's Bone\", and find Katya to be similar to Jennifer Lawrence's character in that she's from a low income neighbourhood, surrounded by meth users, has a missing father (who in the end has a similar fate), a mother who is more needy than nurturing, and a community that is not above dealing violently with her. Is this the modern day dangers that the author is trying to warn the reader about? And does it take the creepy Lolita scenes, the discomfort and danger of this fairytale situation, to imprint the dangers on a deep psychic level? Maybe I'm answering my questions as I ask them, but if there's a way to have my kids turn out more like Jennifer Lawrence's character than Katya, I'm ready to hear it.I can usually find a few quotes to mark and savour but in A Fair Maiden I did not. These seem to be some favourites of others: To the young there are no degrees of old just as there are no degrees of dead - either you are, or you are not. A female is her body. A guy can be lots of things, not just his body.While these might be some interesting observations (and in the second case, while it might be more trope than truism, it at least illuminates Katya's thinking), I don't find them to be examples of amazing writing. And if I may share a peeve about the author's writing in this story: why did she repeat the phrase \"sick-sinking feeling\"? I think it occurred four times throughout this short work and it jolted me every time I saw it repeated after liking it the first time.I can understand why this book was on the discount table-- it wouldn't be for everyone, but it did give me some things to think about. I'll definitely give Joyce Carol Oates more opportunities to enlighten me, knowing that she's not likely to sanitise her storytelling."}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6970638-sheri", "userReview": "Very engaging and well written. The subtle power plays that prove Katya's ultimate powerlessness are interesting to follow throughout. I'm not sure I entirely agree with Oates's strong anti-male (I won't exactly call it feminist, she seems to discuss the lack of control that a women has, but does not really propose any alternatives; her heroine is far from prototypical as a new \"modern\" feminist). In that vein, she has some great quotes: \"A female is her body. A guy can be lots of things, not just his body.\" \"You can be on easy terms with such a man, you can see that he likes you, then by mistake you say the wrong word or make the wrong assumption and something shuts down.\"\"his gentlemanly good nature was possible only when he was obeyed in all things.\" Certainly, Oates's point is that all males (and all females) are interchangeable (to some extent). She argues that men are all driven by sexual motives, and they all hold the power. I get her point, and I like the way she develops the theme, but I don't agree that you can generalize to quite this extent.Another motif that I thought was well done was the daddy/grandpa need that Katya has and which Marcus Kidder fulfills. I loved the innocence that Katya displays by thinking her father is coming back; I loved that she needed Mr. Kidder to love her: she recognized that he was the only one who loved her, but simultaneously acknowledged that he has ulterior motives. I was just as surprised as Katya when she finds out that her dad is most likely dead.Ultimately, Katya is portrayed very well on this threshold between girl and woman-hood. She wants to be sophisticated, she wants to be envyed, but most of all she wants to be loved: \"For Katya wanted to be liked, there was this weakness in her: desperately she wanted to be liked, even by people she resented.\""}, {"userName": "Serena..

She is the winner of the National Book Award, the PEN/Malamud Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and more awards than can be fit into this short review. Her recent short novel, A Fair Maiden, is one of her more minor works. Though I call it minor, it is by Joyce Carol Oates and, by any standard, that makes it major.Katya Spivak is sixteen years old and is working as a summer nanny on the Jersey shore for a relatively wealthy family. She comes from the wrong side of the tracks, a lower class area of New Jersey where most of the adults, if they are working at all, work at minimum wage jobs. Many adults have been in jail or are in jail. Children grow up with no books in their houses and their role models are uneducated, impulsive and often violent adults.Katya is amazed at how the rich live with their maids, nannies, yachts, and affluent life styles. One day she is walking with the two little children who are in her care for the summer and an elderly man approaches her. She happens to be gazing into a lingerie shop, focusing on an intimate red lingerie set. When the elderly man, Marcus Kidder, asks her what she is looking at, she tells him she is looking at a white virginal night gown. He asks her to his house for tea with the children and she agrees.Their relationship develops and it is a strange one, mixed with both longing and repulsion on Katya's side and sexual longing and a fairy-tale like longing on Marcus's behalf for Katya. He sees her as his soul mate, his `fair maiden'. When she visits him a second time he presents a present to her, a package that contains the white gown and the red lingerie set. She can't figure out how he knew she was really looking at the red set and she is insulted, leaving the house shortly.Katya is determined not to return again but she can't help herself. Though the people she nannies for are wealthy, they are not in the same class as Marcus Kidder who is an icon of the town. He refers to himself as a trust fund baby. There are libraries named after him, plaques around town with his family name on them and he is well-known as a philanthropist.Their relationship gets stranger and stranger - convoluted, sexually desperate, ambivalent and wrought with tension. Mr. Kidder tells Katya there will be a big prize for her in the future. What it is she does not know. One horrific night, he tells her a fairytale about a Fair Maiden who helps a great king defy the horrors of death by killing him herself so that he dies rapturously in her hands. This, for him, would be his great gift. It horrifies Katya.Impulsively, Katya does something that sets forth a horrible chain of events. She sees this as a throw of the dice, a saying that her grandfather Spivak used all the time to describe their lives. People do things without thinking and what comes out is like a throw of the dice when gambling. Katya is wrought with guilt but what she has done can not be undone.Like many of Oates's stories this one has a dark and gothic feel. It is like a Grimm fairy tale or a Tim Burton movie. The dark side predominates and the Spivaks are like many of the poor families we meet in Oates's other novels. Oates has a wonderful way of superimposing the lives of the poor and the rich. We see the darkness of both worlds and the freedom that money affords the rich. However, all people are caught up in their own nightmares, no matter how much money they have.This is a short novel, perhaps even a novella, at 165 pages. However, it catches a noir world that does not feel too short.

JCO drew me in, made me uncomfortable and edgy all the way, and then left me disappointed at the end. I'm still not entirely sure what I think of A Fair Maiden. It doesn't help that I read it fast on the heels of seeing Catherine Breillat's controversial film Fat Girl (A Ma Soeur), which deals with a similar theme, although with far less subtlety.From the very start, Oates creates an air of foreboding in the character of Marcus Cullen Kidder. Seemingly harmless, oftentimes clownish, but something is just not right. The \"clown\" comparison just now struck me - how clowns are supposed to make you laugh, but instead make you uncomfortable and a little frightened. His behavior is inappropriate, but by slow degrees, drawing both Katya and the reader into his world.Katya is conflicted - fascinated by Kidder, flattered by his attention, knowing that he is pushing boundaries but tempted by his wealth. She is curious about his past, especially his former (and presumably deceased) models, another element of that sinister undercurrent in Kidder's character. Her relationship with Kidder turns into a game of cat and mouse - with each changing roles.But just when we think we're embroiled in a gothic mystery (is the housekeeper's body in the attic? did Kidder toss the model from long ago into the sea? what's the deal with all the glass flowers anyway?), Katya calls in her version of a knight in shining armor, the spell is broken, and things turn realistically, brutally ugly. In the end, Katya returns to Kidder (her king?) and fulfills his \"mission\" for her - which was not at all expected, given the build-up over the course of the book. So, she was abused (for all intents and purposes) by Kidder, and she was abused by Roy. JCO's portrayal of Roy - sociopathic, criminal, abusive, cruel - makes Kidder's abuse seem loving in comparison. Did Kidder abuse Katya, did he take advantage of her? In the end, this was more of a psychological study of Katya, teenager from the wrong side of the tracks, who was growing up with a lack of positive role models and self-esteem, and was desperately seeking a father figure and an escape from her destiny, than the twisted tale it might have been. Interesting writing conventions - repeated use of proper nouns and full names - search for identity, maybe? Kidder's referring to himself in the third person gave his speech an almost child-like quality, while his \"my dear\" to Katya added an edge of creepiness.Again, lots to think about, but I feel sold short. When I finished, I wished I could call JCO and talk to her about this book, ask what she was thinking when she wrote it."}, {"userName": "David Valentino", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65274049-david-valentino", "userReview": "Dark, Suspenseful, with a SubtextKatya Spivak, sixteen, comes from the wrong side of the tracks, Vineland, NJ, where she feels unloved and badly used, by a father who deserted her, a mother who neglects her, brothers and sisters who have little to do with her, and a sometimes boyfriend who abuses her. So, you can imagine, working as a nanny for a well-off couple in Bayhead, NJ, a wealthy summer community, would be a welcome escape from her normal life.However, even here, though she loves the little girl and boy she minds, she feels the mother takes advantage of her and the husband, when around, leers at her. So you can imagine how the attention paid to her by wealthy and refined Marcus Kidder, sixty-eight, appeals to her, at least initially. That is, until their budding relationship, predicated on his belief he knows her, perhaps from another time, and his use of her as a model, for Marcus Kidder not only is rich, he is a painter, sculptor, composer, and writer of children\u2019s books, strikes you as decidedly wrong. It gives nothing away to say readers will almost immediately suspect Marcus Kidder\u2019s intentions, heightened when he tells Katya that she will one day, when properly prepared, assist him on special mission.JCO\u2019s writing style, here at its most affected, especially in the speech of Marcus Kidder, works superbly establishing character and building the reader\u2019s wariness: something very bad is going to happen. You\u2019ll easily recognize the pattern here, called grooming, and you\u2019ll be even more suspicious of Marcus Kidder, as you observe, along with Kayta, that he has painted and lined his studio walls with numerous young women like her. But things may not be entirely as you fear them to be, and this includes your worst fears.And, upon reflection, after journeying with Katya and Marcus Kidder, you may discover the seemingly simple tale a bit more layered and complex. This is because Oates, consciously or not, raises questions in your mind regarding moral exceptions for artists and the strictures on one\u2019s personal control of one\u2019s life, not to mention the involvement of others, even on a voluntary basis."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie", "userReview": "A strange story by an author who has made thousands of fans by writing about strange things. Katya Spivek, 16, is from a low class family. She is spending the summer in a high class beach enclave, working as a live-in nanny for a rich couple. Her employers seem to regard Katya as a possession -albeit a disposable one. One day, window shopping on the way to taking the children to the park, she meets Marcus Kidder, a long time resident who considers himself far above the new people like Katya\u2019s employers in both money and class. Indeed, the entire town considers him to be such. He and Katya are at the opposite ends of the social spectrum, yet he picks her to befriend.Katya doesn\u2019t know what to make of him- stately gentleman? Old perve after a nubile teenager? He seems innocent enough, charming the three year old, having them to tea. But when he gives Katya an inappropriate gift (red silk underwear), she decides to never go back. Then her drunken mother calls, saying she owes someone bad $300, that she has no one to help her but Katya, and she must send her the money immediately or bad things will happen to her. Turned down by her employers, with no one else to turn to, Katya must borrow from Kidder, putting her in his debt. Already almost powerless by virtue of her social class, now she is completely powerless in this relationship. Things go completely out of her control, spiraling down into a series of dark events. A sense of foreboding fills the entire story. Katya is isolated, not just in the summer town where she knows no one, but also at home. Her father is long gone, her mother an alcoholic gambler, her relatives abusive and violent. Katya stands apart from them because of her love of books and her ambition of going to college. She fits no where. You know all along that bad things will happen to her, that there is no way out for her. She\u2019s young, female and poor."}, {"userName": "Debs", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099587-debs", "userReview": "Oates is always a bit hit or miss for me; I've always preferred her short stories to her novels/novellas. That being said, if you handed me this book without any form of identification and asked me to name the author, I would probably have gotten it in one or two guesses. Oates has a very particular style and the same themes of gender, sexuality and power run through all of her works that I've read.More than anything, Oates' observations regarding female/male relationships and cultural perception always feel spot-on, to me. There's a part in chapter three of this novel where Katya thinks about the difference between women and men where she says something to the extent of \"men can be many things, not just their body. Women are only their bodies.\" This is maybe the part of the novel that stuck with me the most, especially since it seems to keep reappearing in the relationships between Katya and every other character in the book. The women fear her and disdain her because of her beauty, the men--even Marcus Kidder, who proclaims her his soul's mate--see only her physical being. I wouldn't say this is an enjoyable book to read if only because the sinister feel of it that's present from the very beginning. From the moment Kidder approaches Katya at the beginning of the story, we have an inkling of his intentions and that inkling sticks with us as a sinister unsettling feeling until the end. What I liked most about the novel was that it didn't end as expected, and I found the last few pages quite beautiful with their dream-like atmosphere."}, {"userName": "Eliza Rapsodia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6561375-eliza-rapsodia", "userReview": "4.5\"No existe miedo m\u00e1s primitivo que el miedo a que no nos amen y no nos protejan\"Para terminar el a\u00f1o con buen pie, decid\u00ed publicar esta rese\u00f1a hoy ya que es un libro que no quer\u00eda dejar sin rese\u00f1ar.
