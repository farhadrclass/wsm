Multiple topics are covered, and I was astonished at how many I had once heard being told as being true (for example, a teacher once told the \"vacationer who takes in what she thinks is a stray Chihuahua\" story).The only caveat is that Brunvand's writing style can be a little dry at time, but still, the compelling source material makes this a fun read!"}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10051523-paul", "userReview": "Although this book is more of an intellectual study rather than simply a volume of tall tales, Brunvand\u2019s compilation still makes for an interesting read. These urban legends are tall tales which could have occurred easily within our society. Often, Brunvand tries to get to the bottom of the story by tracing it to its source; although often with little success. It\u2019s obvious that many of the stories have had their facts changed too many times for the entertainment value; and there are some things that you simply wouldn\u2019t do. For instance; if it was your birthday would you really abandon you\u2019re your car to walk several miles home? At the end of the volume; Brunvand also fails to reach a conclusion at the end of the volume, instead decides to list parodies of some of the urban legends that he\u2019s just investigated; illustrating how gullible some people can be. It just goes to show that the truth does not stand in the way of a good story, which makes it too good to be true!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32972063-sara", "userReview": "Es un libro que tard\u00e9 en leer y en el que ten\u00eda una idea en mente y me consegu\u00ed con algo completamente distinto.Todos conocemos muchas historias que parecen demasiado buenas para ser verdad, otras que son tan absurdas que es raro que alguien las crea y otras que parecen sacadas del d\u00eda a d\u00eda. Todas ellas, son consideradas de alguna forma leyendas urbanas, esas que han contado tanto que hay muchas versiones o se remontan a much\u00edsimo tiempo atr\u00e1s.En este libro, el autor se encarg\u00f3 de seleccionar y clasificar las much\u00edsimas leyendas urbanas que por a\u00f1os ha investigado; teniendo una idea err\u00f3nea de ellas debido a la pel\u00edcula con el mismo t\u00edtulo, me consegu\u00ed con un libro que es realmente interesante. Contiene una gran cantidad de informaci\u00f3n de cada leyenda, sus variaciones y que, al ser divididas por cap\u00edtulos, poseen una genial introducci\u00f3n a cada clasificaci\u00f3n dada por el autor.Muchas son m\u00e1s hacia lo c\u00f3mico que lo escalofriante y muchas muestran que la naturaleza humana influye much\u00edsimo en los casos relatados.Creo que lo que hizo que no disfrutara tanto del libro como quer\u00eda, fue el hecho de que, al colocar las variantes de una misma leyenda, se volviera algo tedioso y m\u00e1s si le agregas el hecho de que luego se explica detalladamente la investigaci\u00f3n, c\u00f3mo llegaron a conseguirla, etc, etc.Otro punto que fue arma de doble filo, es el estilo de la escritura, el autor al tratar de mantener el estilo de cada tipo de reproducci\u00f3n de las leyendas (e-mails, art\u00edculos, folletos, entre otros) y la falta de separaci\u00f3n evidente entre las versiones, hace que la lectura sea un poco confusa y que la lectura sea m\u00e1s lenta de lo habitual.Le doy un 3.5/5 y lo recomiendo para aquellos que quieran re\u00edr un rato o conocer algunas de las historias que tienen muchos a\u00f1os recorriendo el mundo.

Got us Every.Damn.Time.) I\u2019m now looking forward to my own niece and nephew becoming old enough for me to scare the bejeesus out of, and this book should be a good source for me to mine.A compilation of all of the urban legends you\u2019ve heard (plus many more) ranging from the comic to the horrifying, from the old to the new (including all those warnings about gang initiations, petrol stations and checking the back-seat of your car that people are always sharing on Facebook), Brunvand\u2019s writing style is a little irritating at times, especially whenever referring you to the ten thousand other books he\u2019s apparently written on urban legends, but not enough to detract from the legends themselves."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23898584-monica", "userReview": "Una complet\u00edsima recopilaci\u00f3n, extra\u00eddas de cartas recibidas por el autor a trav\u00e9s de una columna de peri\u00f3dico, de las m\u00e1s famosas leyendas urbanas como el jinete sin cabeza, la planta con bichos carn\u00edvoros, el asesino que est\u00e1 en el asiento de atr\u00e1s del coche, la autoestopista fantasma..etc y sus diferentes variaciones dependiendo del pa\u00eds de origen.Un buen libro, sin duda, para refrescar aquellas fant\u00e1sticas a la par que terribles historias que hemos escuchado, y para conocer nuevas.Entre mis favoritas:El cerebro desparramadoLa mascota mexicanaLa mano lamidaEl testamentoEl garfioConductores decapitadosEl asesino del asiento de atr\u00e1sLa muerte del novioEl cerdo de la carreteraMary sida y harry sidaEl autoestopista desaparecidoPor citar algunas.

Although, I wish it were as analytical as some of his others. He writes interesting books about those stories we are all \"sure\" are \"true\" and exposing them as legends. He also does a fantastic job of expaling what makes an Urban Legend an Urban Legend as opposed to just a rumor or a piece of gossip. Brunvand is also careful to explain and explore situations where the legends have truth to and in them (for example, the idea that people posion halloween candy was around long before there was a case invoving tainted candy - and even then the murderer knew the victims and did not act randomly, relying on the legend to cover his tracks). Buy this one as a handy refrence, but read the others (he also rarely doubles back on legends in the others without a reason to do so or without acknowleding that he's done this before and providing refrence points)."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew", "userReview": "Second only to the Darwin Awards I think urban legends are some of the best and most misquoted stories of exaggeration and impossibility in current oral circulation. Don't get me wrong I am sure we all have a personal story we are adamant is true to the point of blindly arguing their truth if they are questioned BUT you have to admit their sheer impossibility (or in some cases disturbing ease) makes them so appealing. And this book has them all - from pop culture (I have seen them referenced in films and in new broadcasts) to variations told by family members they are the modern Aesop's fables, Baron Munchausen's tall tales and new entries in Edwards Lears book of nonsense - but we can all see their roots in truth and in more than one case I am sure have come close to becoming our own urban legend."}, {"userName": "Richard Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18786509-richard-martin", "userReview": "In 24 chapters and 539 pages ( thus, \"colossal\"), Jan Brunvand presents a cornucopia of urban legends (UL's).

The background consists of how the UL's were obtained and cites sources.
