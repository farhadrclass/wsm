I enjoyed the writing style. I'd be interested in reading more of Hitchens' work on topics I find interesting.But this is a book analyzing political, historical, and literary events in the mid-1980s. I believe the essays are meant to be read in the 1980s, by people with a good understanding of those events. My memories of the mid-1980s mostly involve fingerpainting and watching Popples, so I was not the intended audience. I imagine this sense of bafflement is how my two year year old daughter will feel if, twenty-five years from now, she finds herself reading sardonic analysis of the 2012 presidential debates."}, {"userName": "Erik Graff", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff", "userReview": "Cockburn and Hitchens having been my favorite regular contributors to The Nation, I picked this book by the latter up when I found it. Even now that Hitchens has gone big time with Vanity Fair, leaving The Nation, and has thrown in his hat with the invaders of Afghanistan and Iraq, I still admire the quality of his writing and his acerbic wit.A few years ago I attended a reception for him--by graduate students, I believe--at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. He came, picked up a bottle of scotch and left. I may have seen his back for an instant."}, {"userName": "Katharine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37536586-katharine", "userReview": "A collection of Hitchens' work for different publications, compiled into one book. All excellent. The only problem, which, duh, is that some of the essays are now dated. If you were born after Hitchens himself, expect to have to do some research to understand some of these essays."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8214318-diane", "userReview": "I often wish Christopher Hitchens was still alive, not only because that would be great, but also because I want to know what he would think about all of the events happening in the world these days. Donald Trump, the craziness with Russia and North Korea, the #metoo movement -- everything.But then there are these books. And reading through them it makes me realize that every era has crazy events and controversies and luckily for us, Hitchens wrote about many of them. These pieces about Reagan, Nixon, Nicaragua, South Africa, and more are about another time, for sure, but many of the issues discussed are still current issues. New people, new places maybe; same old world."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4117805-james", "userReview": "Really nice to read Hitchens' early work. I realized I made it all the way to the end of December without reading any of his words. Glad I was able to change that. The reflections on then-current events and particularly the Reagan presidency are not to be missed. And despite the essay collection including articles more than 30 years old, it does not feel dated."}, {"userName": "Lucas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51838782-lucas", "userReview": "I always enjoy reading work that remains engaged and fearless throughout. So many essayists cringe before power or weakness (depending on their political proclivities) that this form of writing has no real future given current trends."}, {"userName": "Mariano", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6772364-mariano", "userReview": "Although some of the political essays are obsolescent, his writing on Kissinger, Reagan, Marx, Guatemala, religion, lobbies, PACs, terrorism, news media etc remains relevant. The book also contains fantastic essays on Borges, Wilde, Orwell and Joan Didion."}], "description": "Hitchens has written a great deal of bracing good sense on politics & literature in the past decades. Much of it has been collected between the covers of this well-packed book. Since these pieces originally appeared in journals as wide-ranging as the TLS, Grand Street, Harper's, Mother Jones, The Nation & Spectator, only the most avid admirer would be likely to have come across them all. In addition to the predictable, eloquent Reagan-bashing, there are thoughtful essays on Paul Scott & his Raj Quartet, the contradictions of George Orwell, the Brideshead phenomenon, that very independent-minded Israeli Professor Israel Shahak, Conor Cruise O'Brien, even something as up-to-date as a perceptive review of Bonfire of the Vanities. Hitchens writes clearly, from a well-stocked mind, & is free of the cant that affects many political journalists. Why the kinds of views that he & his very kindred spirit Alexander Cockburn express so well never receive an airing on TV, where they'd reach a much wider audience, remains a source of shame to a supposedly free medium. In any case, book & magazine readers can feel fortunate that publishers suffer no such self-imposed restraints. -- Publishers Weekly", "title": "Prepared for the Worst: Selected Essays and Minority Reports", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43399.Prepared_for_the_Worst", "average": 4.04, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1284663264l/43399.jpg", "reviews": 8, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3956.Christopher_Hitchens", "name": "Christopher Hitchens"}], "type": ["Politics", "Nonfiction", "Writing", "Philosophy", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43399.Prepared_for_the_Worst", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25590459-prepared-for-the-worst", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43369.God_Is_Not_Great", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13529055-mortality", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1566053.The_Portable_Atheist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7332753-hitch-22", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503150.Letters_to_a_Young_Contrarian"]}
