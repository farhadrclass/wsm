Kind of a shallow choice when you have such a buffet of great one liners and philosophical soul shakers. Raise your hand if you know of a character that can beat Paul \"goddamn\" Hudson. You can't, you ass. You can't. Don't even try. I was so bonded with Eliza that for three hundred and two pages I lived in her paper world, and kissed her rock-stars, and rode on her slow fucking chug a lug train. Man this lady can write. It's always a good book day when a deep, philosophy loving soul, writes fiction. Holy mother of pearl. I am so sad that it's over. I am so smitten with DeBartolo and her brain. She doesn't just write a story, she pumps blood into her characters and then expects us to go on living without them when she decides to be a music exec. Damn you, Tiffanie. I have to go, my pancreas is burning.Over and out.P.S. I'd give this book six stars if I could.

Seriously, if you guys have read this gem, can you let me know how to do it without embarrassing myself?Let\u2019s try\u2026 I had seen this book on GR for a while and I always thought it was just another book about a Rock Star so I wasn\u2019t really interested, not my cuppa anymore. But then, some of the best buddies ever told me to read it. They promised this was something else, different, way better than any other Rock Star book so I decided to give it a try. I was reluctant at the beginning, I thought it was just one more love story and that\u2019s it but there was something else. For starters, the writing style is so damn special, like reading poetry. Just plain amazing! So I kept reading and I soon started to fall in love with the characters.I promised myself I am not going to spoil anything in this story, just gonna tell you guys what\u2019s this one about but that\u2019s it. I am just gonna beg you all to read it and experience this by yourselves.This book tells us the story of Eliza, a young woman who is kinda lost and doesn\u2019t know what to do with her life. She\u2019s passionate about music and after a very lucky encounter she gets a good job that will change her life forever. And that\u2019s why she crosses paths with Paul. That\u2019s it, I am not gonna talk about the story anymore. I know that might not be very attractive but I hope I can convince you with my pics and with some random thoughts that this book awakened in me.Have you ever wished you were somebody\u2019s Sharona??? Not literally, but have you ever wished you were THAT special person for someone? Well, I have. People tend to think that because you are in a relationship everything is unicorn and roses. People tend to think like is black and white but guess what? Life is also GREY. One day you might think your life is perfect the way it is but then one day you might want to change things. And there\u2019s no one to blame, you just know you or your half need a change, right?And then sometimes when you are down and you think life is not smiling back at you, there is a person who you think is just one more person but they might become something else. Back to the book. Do you know what I loved about this story? There is no good ones and bad ones. They were all HUMAN. And yes, we human make mistakes, it\u2019s not the end of the world. I am TIRED of super perfect heroes and super bad antiheroes. NO! Life is not like that. Some authors need to learn from Tiffanie DeBartolo as just a few authors made me believe in characters the way she made me believe in these ones.And then, there are moments in life when you just can\u2019t help but accept your feelings, even if you know you are gonna get hurt because it doesn\u2019t matter, you just need to feel, to love, to give\u2026 no matter what.And yes, we all LIE sometimes. What? Have you never ever lied to the person you love? I did. And it sucks and you hate yourself for doing that (I am not talking about cheating just in case you guys are freaking out) but you just did it and even though is not okay you have to deal with what you\u2019ve done, whether is right or wrong.I know, my review does not make any sense at all, right? I seriously can\u2019t say anything else because I want you guys to read this without knowing anything about the story. It was so goddamn special that I will re-read this one soon because I already miss them.P.S. Loring, I & LOVE & YOU. That is all. I wish I could spend the rest of my life touching the \u2018Y\u2019 of your YALE pants. -------------------------------------------------------------------June 24, 2013This book RUINED me, FOR*FREAKING*EVER!

And the way she used Loring to push Paul away to go on tour without her was a mistake coz that plan clearly backfired. With her stupid charade she hurt Paul and Loring equally. I don't think that she thought about the consequences in detail. Besides, I'm questioning if she really took into account what Paul wanted coz it was more her dream than it was his and she screwed up immensely. Let\u2019s face it, Paul\u2019s goals were not very ambitious. He just wanted to quit his day job and support a family with his music someday. On the other hand, however, she wanted him to become famous. It's the very same thing with our kids, isn't it? We shouldn't project our dreams on our children.

I started thinking, 'maybe I've judged How to Kill a Rock Star too harshly.' Turns out I was right. I still hate this with a fiery passion.I am puzzed by all the five star reviews. Ok, I get it. The story itself wasn't bad and I've got to give props to the author for the good work she did on the plot. The book would have been awesome, had it not been for the terrible heroine. Thick chick... I can't even... She's... Here let me show you. \"The only pen in my purse had purple ink. Purple seemed frivolous and gay and not nearly rock \u2019n\u2019 roll enough.\"  & \"Don't be gay,\" I mumbled, blushing. \"Don't be gay?\" He howled. What the what. Who talks like that? An ignorant child, maybe, but not a mature woman. The crazy thing is, that this happened not once, but twice. If you acted like Eliza in real life, you'd get bitch-slapped. And rightfully so. My favorite color is purple. I guess that makes me gay. Whatever.\nEliza is a lot like me. We listen to the same music. We have the same taste in a lot of things.

They find it hysterical (maybe frightening) that I carry my kindle in my purse with me everywhere I go (you know just in case I might find a few minutes to read here and there). Because I do read so much I am constantly being asked \u201cwhat are you reading\u201d or \u201cread anything amazing lately\u201d? I hate these questions because half the time I am reading my smexy books and I feel a little embarrassed to share the titles (especially when my dentist or someone I barely know asks me) plus they somehow feel private\u2026personal. I also don\u2019t like the pressure of recommending books to people when I read such a specific genre and truly don\u2019t branch out much from my drug of choice. After reading HTKRS I realize I now have an answer to that pesky question. This book is THE BOOK that crosses over and can be so many things to so many different people. THIS BOOK is the book that I will proudly share the title with the stranger sitting next to me on an airplane. THIS BOOK is that book that you\u2019ll always remember; a book that after you have finished reading it has left a little mark on you\u2026a favorite. Now for the meat:What can I possibly say about this book that hasn\u2019t already been said? It is in a word: moving.In more words it is: beautifully written, thought provoking, heartbreaking, inspiring, funny, frustrating at times and absolutely 100% original. Bottom line, it is a book filled with poetry about life and the choices we make.I went into this book blind (which I am realizing is the best way to go). My GR friend, Andrea sent me a little note kindly asking me to make this my next read. She had just finished it and wanted to discuss it (and now I realize purge her emotions about the beauty of this book to someone who would understand how she was feeling). By the time I hit 25% I realized that I had never experienced a book like this\u2026ever. I found myself rereading lines, memorizing them so I wouldn\u2019t forget their meaning. I felt like I should be writing the words down on notecards so I could stick them to my bathroom mirror to later help guide me when life\u2019s challenges start bubbling up to the surface. By the end of the book, I was feeling (a breathless type of feeling) so much that I had to slow down so I could drink everything in and not waste a single word.Because my HTKRS experience was my own and not influenced by someone else\u2019s review, I will not go into details about the story; I can\u2019t stand the thought of ruining this experience for anyone. I will say that this books sticks to your ribs and will stay with you. It will MOVE you; it will make you open your eyes and think about things differently. Even if it is for just a minute, it will be worth it. \u201cReach out touch faith\u201dOver."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4676969-natalie", "userReview": "\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f! How to Kill a Rock Star (stand-alone). Music journalist Eliza moves to New York and falls for talanted lead singer Paul who is trying to make it big with his band Bananafish.LOVEEE...LOVEEE...LOVEEE!!!That a silly little song can alter the course of a person's destiny?This is my third five stars read ever, and it couldn't be more well deserved! if I were to describe this How to Kill a Rock Star, it would probably be with the words pure magic. I had a magical feeling stirring in my body that wanted to get out through this entire book. Like I said, it's sheer, pure brilliance. I don't know how to properly describe my madly, crazy, insane love for How to Kill a Rock Star. If you could have a book as a soulmate, then this would be my own personal matchIt felt like every page was written for me personally. The writing just fucking blew me away! Deep, profound, smart, poetic, witty, raw, honest, beautiful-you name it. Tiffanie DeBartolo has an unique voice. It gave me seriously 'hallelujah moments.\"Not to mention shivers of perfection.Her talent is rare and I'm so in love with her books. It's a gooddamn tragedy that she's only written two (2) books. Both of them has been pure magic to read. Tiffanie is in my top 2 of all time favorite authors. And that says something since I read only two of her books. I pray to her and worship at her altar. That so much I want, need a new book from her. No, the world needs a new book from her. If you aren't already reading her books, seriously! what's wrong with you? We all need a little bit of Tiffanie-magic in this world....She first showed us her magic with God Shaped Hole and made me fall insanely in love with Jacob Grace. With How to Kill a Rock Star she really won me over for life! HTKAR is not your ordinary cheesy rock star romance, nor your typical book either. It's unique, one of a kind. The plot is amazingly simple. Music journalist Eliza moves to New York and falls for the talented lead singer for up and coming-rock band Bananafish. One thing I loved the most was the feel of New York. Not the Upper East Side-kind of New York, but the real New York. The New York with crappy apartments and a genuine, ordinary, simple feeling where musicians tries to get their big brake. This book made me feel more than most books combined. Tiffanie is a genius!I have such an author crush on her. It broke my heart, crushed my soul, I cried a river. I didn't want to continue, I needed a breather more than one time. This was a life altering read for me. My emotions were all over the place. I loved it beyond words can tell. The characters-unbelievable freaking perfection!!! Paul, Loring, Eliza,-I love y'all. But Paul... I feel in love with your personality, your passion, your mind, you goddamn soul! Your point of view is the best I've ever read from a male POV. Goddamn amazing!!! Loring-what can I say about you? Can you be anymore perfect? Seriously? Can you? If it wasn't for Paul, I'd be heads over heals in love with you. What two unforgettable, amazing, wonderful characters Tiffanie has given us. It's something special with her character development we don't usually see, something deep, something real. I guess you have to read it for yourself to understand.\"I was only a child when I learned how to fly I wanted to touch the colors of the bleeding sun and then I fell from the sky You never saw me again not even when I returned you never noticed my broken heart or how my wings were burned But if they tell you they saw me do a swan dive off that bridge Remember I've always been more afraid to die than I ever was to live And on the day I disappear You'll all forget I was ever here I'll float around from coast to coast And sing about how you made me a ghost\".Douglas J Blackman. It had so many 'bigger than life moments,' I want to quote whole sections, but I won't do that here, so you just have to read the book for yourself to experience the magic. Not only is this a great tribute to music, it also has the most incredible love story. I never wanted it to end. Literally never...sigh...it's the least cheesiest ever. Or less cliche.It was like X and X dna pulled them towards each other. One of the most perfect love stories I've ever read. No matter what problems people may or may not have with the characters vs the story, it should be recognised for its sheer brilliance and magic!!!! If you're not convinced to read it by now, I'm at a loss. I want to convince the world to read this gem, this treasure. This has to be the most underrated books of all time.I want to yell my love from the top of my lungs from rooftops!!! To share the love!!!\"There are things we never tell anyone. We want to but we can't. So we write them down. Or we paint them. Or we sing about them. Maybe we carve them into stone. Because that's what art is. It's our only option. To remember. To attempt to discover the truth. Sometimes we do it to stay alive. These things, they live inside of us. They are the secrets we stash in our pockets and the weapons we carry like guns across our backs. And in the end we have to decide for ourselves when these things are worth fighting for, and when it's time to throw in the towel. Sometimes a person has to die in order to live. Deep down, I know you know this. You just can't seem to do anything about it. I guess it's a sad fact of life that some of us move on and some of us inevitably stay behind. Only in this case I'm not sure which one of us is doing which. You were right about one thing though. It's not fate. It's a choice. And who knows, maybe we'll meet again someday, somewhere up above all the noise. Until then, when you think of me, try and remember the good stuff.

Over a year later and a second read behind me (and about half of the book highlighted with quotes - I am not kidding...there is no book I have highlighted more than this one, yet I can't seem to bring myself to want to share the quotes because they are so personal and only mean the most when read in context) and I still can't write a review. Tiffanie DeBartolo dragged me through every possible emotion with this book. She makes me want to take everything I've ever written and throw it away because I'll never be able to do it like this.She is just like her character Paul. Her talent is overwhelming; her words poetic and heart-wrenching. Yet the world doesn't get to see it because hardly anyone knows about this author - only a few of us have have the pleasure of experiencing her brilliance.What exactly is this book, you ask?It's about music. It's about the fight to survive. It's about love, betrayal, heartache, loss, and acceptance. It's about fear and taking risks. This is not literary fiction and this is not romance - don't ask me to put the book into a genre because there is no way to classify HTKARS. It's indie and it's raw and it's a story that wrecked me. *First Read : original blur-fest 2011*Paul, you intrigue me so far...Paul smiled faintly, but all of a sudden he looked sad. \"If I could do something else besides make music, believe me, I would.

And I haven\u2019t smoked in over 25 years.Loring, I loved him too. What a great guy!His only hobby was playing an old Washburn guitar, and in the summertime, when Michael and I were still kids, he used to spend his Saturdays sitting on a plastic lawn chair in the yard, nursing a beer and singing  \u201cBorn to Run\u201d.Michael and I liked to scream \u201ctramps like us\u201d at the top of our lungs.

In the early 1970s, Sixto Rodriguez was a Detroit folksinger who had a short-lived recording career with only two well received but non-selling albums. Unknown to Rodriguez, his musical story continued in South Africa where he became a pop music icon and inspiration for generations. Long rumored there to be dead by suicide, a few fans in the 1990s decided to seek out the truth of their hero's fate. What follows is a bizarrely heartening story in which they found far more in their quest than they ever hoped, while a Detroit construction laborer discovered that his lost artistic dreams came true after all.\nMaybe it was true what Paul said about dreams. When they come true in reality, they never feel the same as they do when you imagine them.\nI want to THANK ...for recommending this one to me.

Absolutely, positively, without a doubt 5 glorious stars!

Tiffanie DeBartolo, I feel like you just kicked my ass in a boxing match and I need to leave the ring on a stretcher. I feel exhausted. Emotionally. But the high I got from this book is worth every tear [happy and sad] I shed while reading it. Thank you!This book is definitely going onto my \"kicking myself for not reading this sooner\" shelf. It sat on my Kindle forever and once I finally got to it, I really did feel like kicking myself or doing this:\nbecause, instead of suffering through some of the mediocre books I came across in the last few months, I should have given this one a chance a loooooooong time ago. My feelings while reading this:\nThis book had me overflowing with emotion because the story hit close to home a couple of times. I am sure I am not the only one who can say that music helped (and still does) get me through some shitty times in life. I don't even think I could have gotten through this book without music so there you have it ... (In no way, shape or form does the last sentence mean that getting through this book was one of the shitty times in my life. Just wanted to clarify.)I can't pick a favorite character in this story if my life depended on it. I loved them all. I loved Paul for staying true to himself. I loved the fact that he loved Eliza as much as he did. I loved that he was a good/true friend which is a very rare thing to find, especially in that industry. I loved Loring for being ... Loring. Once you read the book, you'll know what I mean.I loved Michael and Vera. And I did love Eliza. The girl's got balls.But I haven't experienced this much heartache caused by a bunch of \"what ifs\" in a while. What if Loring did come into his dad's hotel room when Eliza interviewed Doug? What if Bananafish signed with Jack Stone instead? What if Eliza never went back to the Rings of Saturn?I guess the worst \"what if\" of them all could have been - what if I never came across GR and never found out about this book from the amazing bunch that are my GR friends???Did anyone else feel like Tiffanie is the \"Doug Blackman/Paul Hudson\" of the book world who decided to take a hiatus all of a sudden and in her absence we are forced to put up with the \"Amanda Strunk\" type authors who couldn't write their way out of the paperbag??? Anyways, I said this review won't make any sense and it probably doesn't but it doesn't change the fact that this is an exceptionally well-written story & if you haven't had a chance to experience it for yourself, you are trully missing out.

A lot of characters were hurt by nothing being done to shed light on the situation. I really enjoyed the writing style but from the beginning, I never connected with the story or the characters. The one character I really enjoyed was a side character who got caught in the crossfires of the clusterfuck. I felt really bad for them as I knew they were ultimately going to lose the heart of the one they had fallen for. I know this book was written in 2005 and the majority of my friends read it about 4 to 5 years ago and maybe if I had read it back then I might have felt differently about the book BUT the world has changed a lot in that time. There were some words and phrases that just aren\u2019t acceptable to use -\n gay, lesbo and retard.\n A few years ago in my son's Freshman English class, a student had said, \u201dThat\u2019s so gay.\u201d The teacher informed the student they couldn\u2019t say that because it would be like everyone saying, \u201dThat\u2019s so [insert student\u2019s name].\u201d She reminded the students the use of those terms above have a negative connotation. When I read those terms in this book it took me a minute to remember this was written 12 years ago but I still found them to be distracting. The story felt like it could have taken place now and all that was missing to make it feel like current times were cell phones. Overall, I\u2019m glad I read it because I was able to see why this would be a classic Goodreads book. HOW TO KILL A ROCK STAR is on the majority of my friends\u2019 favorite list as a must read book. It\u2019s something that caused a lot of readers to flip pages to see what would happen next. It was also published when there wasn\u2019t a lot of contemporary romance to pick from. It's a book where you have to experience it for yourself to see how it affects you.

A book that made you laugh and made you cry. A book made you dust off old records and listen to the old melodies but never forgotten melodies of the past. A book that made you want to pick up a guitar and play those songs that made your heart bled a little. How?\nContained in this book is a love story. But it's not just a love story between two people but a love story between man and his music. Safe to say, this book is an ode to rock n' roll. A frank and often brutally honest look at the music world. Both Eliza and Paul, and many of other characters, Loring, Doug and the Michaels, lived and breathed music. It was their passion. It was in their blood.\nThe power of music rests in its ability to reach inside and touch the places where the deepest cuts lie. Like a benevolent god, a good song will never let you down.\nI don't want to fill my review with quotes although the book contained so many of them, it was hard for me to choose. But I will tell you that this book was just amazing. Well written, thoughtful, intelligent and brutally frank. Tiffanie DeBartlo will capture your heart, ensnare you minds and will make you ask questions about the things that you really want. \nAt the heart of this story is Paul Hudson, a talented music prodigy, who like other musicians before him struggled to make a career out of the thing he loved most, which is his music. Paul, as I said, was a musical genius. He writes this songs that grabs at you. But Paul is frustrated with the state of the music industry. He had talent but the industry is different now. Pop is the reigning queen and it's the music execs who decides whose talents live or die. I loved how the book takes you on the ins and outs of the music industry. This book will make you question your taste in music, I assure you. I remembered reading the chapters about Paul explaining to Eliza who Mr. Winkle is and I was thinking, \"Holy hell! I don't want my music tainted by Mr. Winkle! No way!\" Mr. Winkle by the way is a representation of money hungry music execs whose main concern is the bottom line. You will realize, as you read this book, at the unfairness of it all. How many talented musician do you think are out there that we'll never get to hear because some music exec didn't think they're good-looking enough to sell an album? Hundreds, if not thousands probably. I found myself nodding my head and agreeing with Paul, Doug, Eliza and the true believers that music, or should I say rock n' roll is dying and is in dire need of a savior. \n\u201cBut sometimes talent isn\u2019t worth shit. There are tons of talentless people out there making zillions of dollars. And unfortunately, an equal number of brilliant artists whose names and voices you\u2019ll never hear.\u201d\nPaul Hudson was supposed to be that savior. With his talent and charisma, he seemed poise to to save American music from itself. The question is who will save Paul? \nEnter Eliza Caelum, a young music journalist who matched Paul's passion for music. She moved in with Paul after snagging a job at a reputable music magazine. And when she and Paul met, they fell in love. Eliza was hesitant at first and Paul's reputation as man-whore didn't help his case. But against all odds, they fell in love.As I mentioned before, this wasn't a gushy love story. It was very sweet but also melancholic and yet the interactions between Paul and Eliza pulls you in with them. They were open, honest and it was funny as hell especially Paul's journal recordings. Those where my favorite. Through his recordings, we learn about Paul's feelings for Eliza, his band, his music and his attitude towards success.\nRemember this moment, my friend the tape recorder. Lying next to Eliza, I had the feeling I\u2019d just found something I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d lost.But trying to describe how I felt watching her dance around and sing would be like trying to build a skyscraper with my bare hands. It made me want to marry her. Made me want to buy her a magic airplane and fly her away to a place where nothing bad could ever happen. Made me want to pour rubber cement all over my chest and then lay down on top of her so that we\u2019d be stuck together, and so it would hurt like hell if we ever tried to tear ourselves apart.\nThey were happy but as Paul said, happiness is fleeting. Just when all stars have finally aligned; they signed with major music label, Eliza and Paul's relationship is solid and looking forward to the future, the shoe had to drop. I won't divulge anything because it would spoil the whole story. But you know the feeling you get during a roller coaster ride when you reached the highest point and suddenly the car, plunges down and you feel heart drop to the bottom of your stomach? Yup, that was how I felt while reading those chapters and it didn't let go until the about 90% of the book. \nAside from that, I seriously, seriously wanted to hurt Eliza and Paul, too. Stubborn shits. But just when you thought all hope is lost, John the Baptist stepped in. I'm not kidding. John the Baptist was in this book. I won't say anything anymore. You have to read the book yourself. But let's just say that the ending will make you happy. I don't know if it will be satisfying for everyone but personally, I was happy with the ending. I thought it was a fitting. It was rebellious, a sort of fuck you to the world who tried to let them down.\n\u201cBottom line, Eliza\u2014 you\u2019re my home and my family, and I don\u2019t want to lose you. I could lose everything else, and as long as I still had you and a guitar I know I\u2019d be all right. Do you get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\nI would be remiss in my review if I don't include some of my fave quotes. Don't worry though, I won't post anything too spoilery.\n Shitney Spears\"Do you understand how big that is? That a silly little song can alter the course of a person\u2019s destiny?

Being in the middle of love is like being in the middle of a war zone.What I love, what it\u2019s about for me, and what it\u2019s always been about, is the music. Everything else I can use to wipe my ass.I\u2019ve got my girl and my guitar, and for me that\u2019s enough.

How to Kill a Rockstar  is the story of Eliza, a young rock journalist who in a twist of fate, meets her idol and follows her dreams. After landing a job as a journalist in a prominent magazine in New York, Eliza moves in with her brother, and meets her new roommate Paul Hudson.  \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t like inherently happy people.

It was magnificent. I think that's the main reason I liked this book as much as I did was because of the writing. The author made this book more than just another rock romance, and I have a feeling if anyone else had written something like it, it would have fallen flat.-Eliza: Yeah she was dumb at times, but I understand from her standpoint she was desperate to help her brother. She was a great supporter and sister.-Loring: I root for the underdog, what can I say? And as the underdog, this guy rocked!  My issues with this book: -My biggest issue? The casual use of the words \"gay\" \"lesbo\" and \"retard\" being used as insults. I don't care if it's half-hearted or a joke. It was insulting to me. Maybe because this book was written 10+ years ago and was placed in 2000 it was okay then, but not okay now (and for me not ever).-Paul: Dear God, I really didn't like that man. I spent most of the second half of the book wanting to slap him and not understanding why Eliza loved him. ^^^in an unconventional rating system from me, I docked off half a point rating for each of these things = 4 stars. I docked another .25 points because I felt the story was fairly predictable even though it was enjoyable.Overall, I really liked this book, but I didn't love it.

It moved me emotionally and I simply could not put it down. I could say I loved it because the book is beautifully written. Or I could say that the book is a favorite because the dialogue is incredibly witty and funny. Yes, that is all true. But that is not why it affected me so deeply \u2013 this book is so powerful because the characters are so completely real. Okay, the book was powerful. The book was a favorite. But what does that mean? It means I stayed up until 2:00 am on a work night to finish it. It means that I cried my eyes out not just once but a three times! It means I got so pissed off at the main characters I almost threw my kindle \u2013 more than once. It means that I cannot wait to read this book again.The story is told from the point of view of two main characters: Eliza and Paul. Eliza\u2019s personality is similar to a friend I knew and snippets of her life as written in this book were very similar to my past. This book is a contemporary romance, but it is also more than that. What many romances authors get wrong is that they write characters which are too perfect and perhaps that is part of the fantasy: the characters are extremely beautiful, the sex is over the top amazing, and the relationship proceeds without any road bumps \u2013 and oh, of course at least one of the main love interests is unbelievably wealthy. These themes definitely have their place in the romance genre, it is a great escape. But How to Kill is not a romantic escape. It is a romance that baptizes you by dunking your head in cold water \u2013 and keeping it under the water until you think you will explode. In a good way, I promise!How to Kill a Rock Star is not a fantasy romance novel. The characters are described to look like real people; the characters struggle financially and the real world intrudes on making their dreams come true. The most authentic for me in this story, was how the author wrote the romantic relationship. No matter what we fantasize about, the love of our life may not be the most handsome and he may not be the sweetest; sure as hell, he likely won\u2019t be the richest. But even with these imperfections, the love and romance can still be a powerful all-encompassing love. Then there is the ugly side of love. When people are hurt and when they feel betrayed, they may do ugly mean things \u2013 to themselves, to each other, to their friends, to their careers; rationality is not always the most followed course during a messy period in a romantic relationship. Ms. DeBartolo does not shy away from writing how relationships devolve, how they break down and how they get ugly.How to Kill is also more than a love story about two young people, it is also a love story of the characters' romance with rock and roll,\u201cIt sounds silly, I know. But for me, the power of music rests in its ability to reach inside and touch the places where the deepest cuts lie. Like a benevolent god, a good song will never let you down. And sometimes, when you're trying to find your way, one of those gods actually shows up and gives you directions.\u201dIf you are looking for an emotional read that will stay with you for a long time, then I highly recommend this book. Below are some of my favorite quotes from this book:\u201cFor the record, if I were Superman, a pale, scrawny guy holding a guitar would be Kryptonite.\u201d\"I wanted to freeze the moment. Freeze it and jump inside of it and stay there until it melted into the warm, swishy liquid of happy memories.\"\"I celebrated the scene as one of those rare instances when you actually catch sight of happiness in motion. Happiness made everything soft and shiny like Vaseline on a camera lens.\"\"The thing is, we loved each other, and on some level we always will, but when you're twenty-three and you fall in love, you tend to think that love will supersede any problems .. no matter how much you love somebody, no matter how desperately you want a relationship to work, life can act as an oxidizer and corrode it to pieces.\"\"'Come on. We had sex. You have to.' He chuckled. 'Eliza, if that were my only criteria, do you know how many girls would know my real name?'\" \u201cCome on. We had sex. You have to. \u201cThere's a big difference between being alone and being lonely.

She possessed this sadness and darkness, almost like it\u2019s always looming over her. Eliza just had stopped dreaming the dream, until the night she meets Doug Blackman.

He is insanely talented, crap I bet he can make the dictionary sound amazing. Yet what I loved more about Paul was his solid truth. He was always about the love and the music. Always trying to stay true to the music. He too had a dark past, a past that helped his art have more meaning. In a way I guess all good artist are.The moment Eliza and Paul meet, its fate. The magnetic pull that draws them in the moment there eyes meet, WOW. As I was reading, I had to stop and absorb the intensity of the connection. As I got the chill and saw that these two people are meant to be. This book was perfection. Their souls knew one another, artist-to-artist, skin-to-skin, and heart to heart. They were different yet so much the same. They had journeyed some of the same paths. They survived to see the light, because they were meant to be. Their love is epic and surreal, and I also knew good to be true. As Paul rises to fame, the darkness that surrounds Eliza attaches itself even more. I hated Eliza for her weakness in overcoming this fear. When she decides to become a martyr, it just about kills me. I wanted to poke her eyes out. YOU STUPID BITCH!!!

It just hurt too much to imagine my world without Paul Hudson. In the end I am extremely happy with the ending and love, I repeat love this book. It wove its way into the core of my heart and will forever have a spot there. Just the extraordinary simplicity of the moment-the kind of moment that has a funny way of making a person believe that life and love can last forever\u2026"}, {"userName": "Penelope \u2718 that awkward girl that doesn't go here \u2718 ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17357717-penelope-that-awkward-girl-that-doesn-t-go-here", "userReview": "I honestly have no idea what to say about this book. My immediate reaction after finishing this was to throw my kindle against my bedroom wall and give this book a nasty review. However, I let myself simmer (well, mainly due to the fact that I had indulged in my idiotic tendencies and read the whole book rather than sleeping for work and had to leave that very moment or else be late) composed myself, and thought to share what I took from this read.There are four messages that I took away from this book:1) The power of music. I don't think this is a novel concept at all, but DeBartolo's depiction of the music scene, especially from the viewpoint of a struggling and brilliant artist/band, brought back sharp memories of when I used to lose myself in music. I could relate to the goosebumps that Eliza got from hearing Paul sing and for the first half of the book, I was in a wonderland of sound. I could visualise the music, the emotions behind it that I literally got shivers from reading it.2) Never allow anyone to mess with your dream. Don't compromise, don't be a sell out, stick true to your dream. Don't be tempted by the easy option, the option that would give you the quickest success possible. Stay true to yourself.3) Never wait until its too late to start living. Don't put off what needs to be done because you're afraid. Face things head on, you'll have less regrets that way.4) TALK. SHIT. OUT. Honestly, I was homicidal for the last half of the book. I swore like a stereotypical sailor. I kept squinting at the bottom left hand of my kindle, wishing the number to magically turn into 99% done so the torture could be over. I felt my eyes glaze over and my brain dribble out my ears. I hated every single damn character, everyone except Paul. I tried to be sympathetic, I really did, but when I remembered that Eliza and I are the same age, I thought, hell naw. My heart shrivelled up at Paul becoming a mess and begging Eliza not to leave him and I honestly wished that Eliza and Loring would just swan dive into the Hudson. My stomach (or it could have been my pancreas) burned for the rest of the story because I was so mad at Eliza for her white saviour complex, for being arrogant in thinking she was the key to saving Paul, for regarding herself as selfless for this sacrifice when everything would have worked out if she just opened her damn mouth and just spoke to Paul about every damn thing she was thinking.OK, sorry, calming down now.After much internal debate, I decided to give this book two and a half stars. I felt like this book could have been so much more if it had gone in a different direction. Whilst I did hate the journey that this book took us on in the last half, I thought it would be unfair to discount the amazingness of the first half of the book, the on point imagery and brilliant writing, not to mention the final twist at the end which became a saving grace of sorts. Would you recommend this? Surprisingly, yes. Because I know I'm an oddball and really finicky about my reads, I know that what didn't work for me would usually work for everyone else. I just like to be a contrary bastard. Have a review from a good friend who enjoyed this."}, {"userName": "Brandi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5494655-brandi", "userReview": "There are no words for how much I loved this book, it is one of my all time favorites. I wish I could find the words to express how wonderful this book is, but nothing I could write would do it justice. It is the best example of how perfection renders me speechless. I feel so guilty for not being able to create some awesome eloquent review, seriously IT.IS.MY.FAVORITE.BOOK.. And all I can say is  READ IT! - Tiffanie DeBartolo is like a genius. Magic flows from each page. This book gives me an affection erection - it's fucking perfection!\n\"Personally, I don\u2019t like inherently happy people. I don\u2019t trust them.

There she meets and falls in love with Paul, they face a number of challenges, but their love for each other is so true, raw, and beautiful. Again - I LOVE THIS BOOK!Eliza and Paul will forever be two of my favorite characters. This story pulled me in right away, I have already read this book 2.3.4. 5 times! I am absolutely in love with Tiffanie's writing style. I have never related to characters as much as I have with Eliza and Paul, I felt everything they felt. A bonus for me is the music and portrayal of the music industry\n\n \"I just happen to comprehend the low standards of the majority of the music-buying public, and I don't care how condescending that sounds, it's true.

Ever see the movie  Almost Famous ? This book is that movie, 30 years later, as far as its depiction of the music industry as it zeros in on one band trying to find success. It was funny, tender, sophisticated. There really isn't much else to say here except that this book moved me and made me feel so much...intensely and passionately! I 110% loved it! \nWhat an incredible author! Why hasn't this book been made into a movie?!?! I loved every minute of it. It was real, complex, involved, and the characters were lovable, yet messy. I loved each of them in their own way... except for Lucy. I definitely did NOT love that bitch! :)But my favorite two characters, even beyond Paul and Eliza...and Loring, were music and this brilliant author, Tiffanie DeBartolo! I highlighted the majority of this book! I would give my right hand to be able to write half as well as this woman does. \n \"...for me, the power of music rests in its ability to reach inside and touch the places where the deepest cuts lie.\"\n~ElizaAnd thank you for writing Paul to be an unconventional book boyfriend with such intense character. We didn't need to read about what he looked like naked or throbbing manhood business (not that I would have minded...let's not get crazy now)...but he didn't dress the part, nor did he care to, but fuck me, he was just as sexy! Give me a guitar playing lead singer with a smart mouth and eyes that burn right through you and the rest is just the cherry on top! Don't get me wrong, this is an INCREDIBLE story...but there is always that special something that when you love a book, takes it from good to great. And for me, it was by far the writing. It wasn't just good \"love story\" writing. There were so many points where I just had to stop and think about a line I had just read and let it resonate. Lines about yes love, but life, music, society, and the world. Here are just a few of my fave quotes:\n \"Hey, don't take this the wrong way, but suffice to say that if I'd seen you in the subway station and not been there looking for you, I would've wished I was.\" ~Paul\"Nobody, and I mean nobody, ever started a revolution playing by the rules\" ~Doug Blackman\"I couldn't feel the truth. Does that make sense? Do you know what the truth feels like?\" \"I know what it sounds like\" ~Eliza/ Paul\"...But when you're twenty-three and you fall in love, you tend to think that love will supercede any problems. That's what Rusted is about. Realizing that no matter how much you love somebody, no matter how desperately you want a relationship to work, life can act as an oxidizer and corrode it to pieces.\" ~ Loring\"As usual, the F train took forever. I decided F stood for fucking-slow-ass-crowded-fucking chug-a-lug train.\" ~Eliza\"Has the music industry done to music what McDonald's has done to eating?\" ~ Eliza\"There are things we never tell anyone. We want to but we can\u2019t. So we write them down. Or we paint them. Or we sing about them. Maybe we carve them into stone. Because that\u2019s what art is. It\u2019s our only option. To remember. To attempt to discover the truth. Sometimes we do it to stay alive. These things, they live inside of us. They are the secrets we stash in our pockets and the weapons we carry like guns across our backs.\" ~ Paul\nGah! There are so many more! I am not exaggerating when I say that I could paste the entire book in here! It was that wonderful!! Castings: Paul/ Eliza\nHmm... and for those of you who need some more convincing that Jared Leto IS the perfect Paul...here ya go:\nIf that's not Paul, I don't know what is! :) Loring\nIncredible love storyBrilliant love triangleBeautiful charactersProfound meaningSome of the most powerful writing you will ever have the pleasure of reading!!!And OH MY GOD that ending!!!!!!!And my very favorite quote of all...\n\"We all start out as little fishes in our daddy's pants, and we all end up a Thanksgiving feast for the worms, and in the meantime we have to find a couple good reasons to give a fuck. I've got my girl and my guitar, and for me that's enough.\"\n ~PaulOver."}], "description": "Written in her wonderfully honest, edgy, passionate and often hilarious voice, Tiffanie DeBartolo tells the story of Eliza Caelum, a young music journalist, and Paul Hudson, a talented songwriter and lead singer of the band Bananafish.
