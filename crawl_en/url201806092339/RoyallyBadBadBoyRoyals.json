I was already a prince - in a sense - so why couldn't it work? We'd dance, I'd put the shoes on her prefect feet, and we'd kiss and laugh, and all would be fucking sparkles and hearts.\"\nI really had a hard time picking between a 2 and 3 stars on this. I mean, I have a hard time judging truly because this isn't really the genre I prefer to read. Still, despite my low expectations it was surprisingly entertaining - despite the parts that made me laugh out loud and think...come on...really.So the book is about this girl, Sammy, who becomes super involved in this family's, the Badd's, personal affairs. From making a wedding a dress, to being a brides maid, to being arrested with them. The day they Badds entered her family was the day her life changed from it's boring and quiet ways.The plot itself was...well entertaining enough. What I mean by that was that it was enough for me to finish the book. There were a few parts that left me wondering...why? Like, the Mr. Badd didn't really know the relationship between Kain & Sammy, but still felt inclined to protect the girl because something concerning her might affect the family.....okay. It wasn't really expected considering his position. The ending was a little predictable, well part of it was, but that's okay.The characters were so-so. Sammy was a cute little feisty girl, but was a little too trusting. Kain was sort of a d-bag. His third sentence in the book was, \"Don't use the worlds 'little' and 'dick' in the same sentence with me.\" I mean serious eye roll, this guy is so into his penis and thinks he is all that. In fact, a lot of the things Kain says is pretty eye rolly-y. He's got that macho protector character down. At least there weren't a ton of hits-his-chest-cave-man moments.All in all, it was a quick and easy read. Funny at some moments with a large dash of cheesy romantic scenes. My biggest problem is I can't get behind a guy who is so fully of himself and having a character change so quickly.

I liked the idea of the gangster prince and the wedding dress maker. I laughed more than expected, although I have to admit, not all of my laughter was necessarily in places where it was supposed to be. Certain elements were particularly far fetched - BUT this was also what I really enjoyed about Sammy and Kain's romance. The drama and escapism.Sammy is awkward and funny. I honestly wasn't sure what she was going to do or say next. She finds herself going from dress maker extraordinaire/unwilling wedding guest, to basically being deeply involved with the Band family and all aspects of Kain's life.I expected to love Kain but he didn't manage to totally win me over. I wasn't sure about how he treats Sammy at times or allows others to treat her whilst claiming to want the best for her.

I thought Sammy was strong and a little rebellious and Kain falling for her was super sweet. I did enjoy the Badd family and Fran was adorable, though like a mouse you give a cookie too. My issues with it were that they were royals. Really, in the storyline, it wasn't important. At all. Other than telling me they were, I didn't see it. Supposedly the next book should have it considering something said towards the end. My other issue was the ending was too nice. It could have been so much more, but it felt like an \"everything is now good, no bad stuff anymore\" ending. Something even happened that had me rolling my eyes, though it was foretold if you read between the lines.

But it's utterly marvelous trash.I mean, I took my kindle with me to take a quick, relaxing bath, and ended up staying in for over an hour, laughing myself silly with this book. Because this thing is hilarious. It's amazing. It's the kind of trash that is more of a comedy than anything else, and I'm dying over here. I'm dying from how stupendously shit this book is.Here, here, don't take my word for it. Let me share with you some of my favorite passages. I bookmarked them because I just couldn't help myself. Obvious warning for foul language, explicit sexual content, and overall bad writing.On page 25 we have this exchange,  \"I'll jerk this cock off to thoughts of you, sweatheart. I especially like it because this is their second (third?) meeting, and this is definitely something you say to someone you're sexually interested in. Nothing feels better than knowing a guy is going to go off and jerk it to you. Page 32,  I want to see those tits of yours in all their glory. FYI guys, you know what really turns girls on? Talking about their tits. Nothing sets the mood like tits. Tits, tits, tits.Then we move along to page 146, to enjoy, ...I'm going to fill you up. I'm coming, I'm coming and coming, and I'm not going to ever stop.\" Now look, I get it, the author wants to impress upon you how virile and manly Kane is. He can just come forever. Impressive. Just what every girl wants. To have gallons of come in her. But upon reading this, one can't help but worry in a medical sense. I mean, he's never going to stop coming? Where's all that semen coming from? His balls? Are they the size of Mars? And how's he ever going to get anything done if he literally never stops coming?And finally, on page 152 (you're all reading along, right?) we've got the sensational, Fighting down my animal urge to rail her with my cock, I revved my motorcycle. I believe that one speaks for itself. Rawr.Look, this is a dime store kind of trash book. It's supposed to be just good fun. It's supposed to be for horny women who want to rub one out with some sexy characters. And that's fine. But the problem develops when you have anyone who's looking for a semblance of plot. I read this whole book. I still don't get why the bad guys were after the girl. I don't get why Kane suddenly went from douchebag with a hard on to knight in shinning armor with a heart on, in the span of twenty pages. I don't get why most things were happening. And I certainly don't understand how the end plot twist just came out of thing air, with no build up and no rational, and then became the focal point of the point.And hey, I may have read better sex scenes in fanfiction on AO3, but I'm okay with reading trash sex. I did grow up reading VC Andrews. But everything in this book seemed like it was written just to lead up to the sex, and that's cheap, dirty, and not enjoyable.But I'm not even mad with this book. It was free, I had a hell of a laugh with it, and in the end, I got to write this amusing review. So no hate.

Everything was instant and there was a lot happening and some of the wording made me feel like I maybe missed something. I was curious enough that I kept right on reading though. I'm glad I did because the story really picked up. I really liked Kain. He was an alpha tough guy but also super sweet. I liked Sammy in the beginning, I thought she was a pretty tough chick that didn\u2019t put up with a lot of crap.

But her ending was better than her beginning. 2) The main guy was hot but his portrayal was sooooo typical. But he was nice to the main character and he developed a bit. 3) Plot....was mainly romance focussed so any hard plot developments are done in the background, only coming up to the forefront when the romance needed it. 4) Kain's older brother looks to be an interesting story. 5) Would have liked to see more development of character for everyone. oh and 6) The father is totally crazy!!!! Overall, a quick effortless read. No brains or even solidifying of emotions needed!"}, {"userName": "\u2661 Jeri's Book Attic \u2661  I am ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20537528-jeri-s-book-attic-i-am", "userReview": "Not sure what to think about this book. The story is interesting in total and well written but I had a slight problem with the writing style. Somehow it felt like it was wandering from a romantic comedy to a slightly dark romance and back.And in my mind those two genres do not mix. It felt like the author wanted to much and could not decide in which direction the story should go.The whole setup was kind of confusing and intense and then again meant to be funny \u2013 it might be only me so you should give the story a try\u2026\u2550\u2550\u2550 PLEASE SUBSCRIBE / LIKE / FOLLOW US \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550Blog : http://www.jerisbookattic.comFB Page : https://www.facebook.com/JerisBookAtticTwitter : https://twitter.com/JeriTRyanGoodreads : https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2...Bloglovin : https://www.bloglovin.com/@jerisbooka..."}, {"userName": "Konny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30952995-konny", "userReview": "Royally Bad by Nora Flite is the first book in The Bad Boy Royals Series.Meet Sammy, a wedding planer and talented wedding dress designer.
