(In this book, one can't speak of \"The\" Crucifixion with a capital C, since there are crucifixions left and right.)This book was artfully constructed and very competently written. Religiously conservative Christian believers may find some elements of it offensive - the author Naomi Alderman, writing fairly conspicuously from a Jewish perspective, begins from the viewpoint that Jesus is a man of the period, a traveling preacher of which there were many, teaching doctrines little removed from those of other rabbis. Historically, of course, with millennia of faith subtracted from the equation, her version of the story makes perfect sense. My reaction to this book is a little complicated ... on the one hand, I admired the artistry of how she structured it, and her bravery in telling her straightforward view about who might have lied and how and why in the process of constructing the Jesus of Christianity. Of course, I'm an unbeliever myself, so I found the realism of her approach very refreshing.There were a few things I didn't like, though. If she had confined herself to the notion of the humanity of the people who lied, and the way in which even the lies circle around people who were still very interesting figures, all would have been well. But instead, halfway or three quarters of the way through the story I started to feel she was getting into the age old question of who was to blame for Jesus being crucified. The anti-Semites' answer, of course, has always been \"The Jews.\" Alderman's answer is the traditional Jewish rebuttal - no, it was the Romans. There are few or no good Romans in her book. Granted, she is writing from the standpoint of Jewish characters, but still ... by dehumanizing the Romans and leaving out their viewpoint, she really introduces a fatal philosophical and aesthetic flaw ... they become an army of mostly two-dimensional monsters. And the book's aesthetic purpose becomes subordinate to a kind of anti-defamation subtext that cheapens the enterprise. That was a disappointing choice to me.The book also follows the tradition of many past historical novels about Jesus in being stone-cold sober with a somber atmosphere (cf. Jose Saramago, Phillip Pullman), if it at least has the virtue of avoiding any syrupy inspirational tone. None of the characters were very likeable or sympathetic (again, cf Saramago, Pullman). And it was all a little depressing. So if you are looking for something a little more upbeat, stick with Christopher Moore's Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal.As for her treatment of the historical aspects of the period, it will probably sound strange for me to say this, but I felt like Alderman's Judaea was, well, a little too Jewish. All the characters have Hebrew names. Well, great, right, didn't they speak Hebrew? Actually, probably not - but rather Aramaic or Greek. Hebrew was little enough used that Targumim, or Aramaic translations of the scriptures, had to be used in most synagogues. Alderman lets us know right up there in the book's dedication that she's studied Hebrew and Latin, lest we doubt her chops, and she does indeed do wonderfully well at giving us the flavor of Hebrew in the character names and the occasional cultural tidbit - but there is hardly any flavor of Aramaic in the book, and less of Greek.In fact, my impression from reading into the history of the period is that the culture was not so monolithically Hebrew, let alone so monolithically Rabbinic Jewish. \"Judaism\" as such did not exist during the time of Jesus, any more than Christianity did - the system of rabbinic rulings was in its infancy and there is no conclusive evidence that rabbinic norms were practised widely before the temple's destruction. Hellenization was a powerful force, there were a lot of pagan cities and pagan inhabitants throughout the region, Greek and Syrian and Aramaic and Nabataean-Arabic cultural elements all had their own peculiarities. The Idumaeans in the south were not all that Jewish, having only relatively recently been forcibly converted to the Israelite religion under the Hasmoneans, and Galilee too had been converted and had not long before been pagan. It was viewed as kind of a backwoods area, is my impression, and the rabbis sometimes called it \"Gallilee of the Gentiles.\" That's why I say Naomi Alderman's Judaea is a little too Jewish, because I think the real Judaea was a much more religiously and culturally fragmented place than she depicts. Now, that said, every writer about this period has to interpret the historical evidence as best he or she can - usually none of us are full-time scholars in the field - and I think by emphasizing the Hebrew and normative rabbinic culture in her depiction, she has illuminated very important aspects of the historical Jesus. So even if it might not be a full or perfect picture, it's still an important one, and this is a valuable work."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Stephens", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7124955-jennifer-stephens", "userReview": "The Liars' Gospel by Naomi Alderman is a \"creative\" retelling of life in Israel under Roman occupation and early on centers on Jesus. Alderman's crafting of words is superb so it's quite disappointing that she put her talent to work slandering a public figure in such an offensive manner.In the novel we are exposed to the viewpoints of Mary, Barabbas, and Judas as imagined by Alderman. I can get behind historical fiction wherein we take a real place or course of events to set the scene and slide in imaginary characters to build a plot. Likewise I enjoy a twist on a known public figure that shows another side of them that is faithful to their overall historical presence but adds a new dimension of storytelling. But I really have a problem with a convenient retelling that absolutely butchers the essence of a character we've come to know through history. Jesus punching his father in the face and the other nonsense that goes on in The Liars' Gospel is disgusting and the character sketch of Jesus as depicted by Alderman is very offensive to not only Christians but to the record of history. What's next, a historical novel about Ghandi detailing his secret role as a fascist, working undercover for the state to stir up insurrection and justification for his friends in power to destroy the people? Perhaps a creative retelling of the civil rights movement with Martin Luther King recast as a drunkard and adulterer whose main focus was becoming famous and having a movie made about himself? Or we could approach it from the other direction and spin a moving story of Hitler and how he was deeply misunderstood?I've read other reviews in a similar vein (thus my voice ads to the chorus) and so I know what's next: cue the godless hoards to leave argumentative comments on this review and attack my coverage of the novel."}, {"userName": "Lyn (Readinghearts)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2124637-lyn-readinghearts", "userReview": "Naomi Alderman's new novel, The Liars' Gospel is defintely not a book for everyone. The book is set in the first century and centered around the life of a Jewish prophet, Yehoshuah (Jesus to us). Although it is ostensibly a retelling of the story of Jesus, I found Alderman's detailing of the political climate in Jerusalem during the rise and fall of Jesus much more interesting. The story is told from four viewpoints. That of Marym,Yehoshuah's mother, His friend and follower Ieudah of Queriot, the Roman High Priest of Jerusalem, Caiaphas, and the rebel Bar-Avo. As you read, it is easy to see that Marym is Mary, Ieudah is Judas Iscariot, and Bar-Avo is Barrabas. I thought that Alderman's decision to tell this tale from 4 vary different viewpoints was a brilliant idea. Each character had a different relationship with Jesus and none of them alone could have told the tale completely by themselves. The switching of voice throughout the book allows the author to cover, not only the different times periods of Jesus' life, but also the different facets of his life. Of the four tellings (or gospels, per the title) I feel the best one was the telling by Judas. It is here that we first get to see what political forces are at work in Israel between the occupying Romans and the Jews. This political background was the most interesting part of the book to my thinking. Since I am not very well versed in the history of Israel, the Jewish faith, or the Roman empire during the time of Tiberius, I found this part of the book illuminating. The idea that the political forces at work during this time period could play such a major role in allowing Jesus to gather a following, and therefore, to become both who he was and who he wasn't, was what I liked best about the book. One reason that I see this book as more than just the retelling of Jesus story, is that the second two \"gospels\" those of Caiaphas and Barrabas do not seem to have much to do with Jesus at all. Although Caiaphas was the High Priest of Jerusalem during this time, he never really came in contact with Jesus in a large way. His focus was more in the arena of the political strife between the occupiers and the native populations, and his efforts to reconcile the two. In the case of Barrabas, he went on to continue to lead the rebellion of the Jews against the Romans long after Jesus was dead. In fact, his story began with the death of Jesus and continued on with the focus on the political. For me this was the second best section of the book. All in all, I found Alderman to present a thought provoking work that captivated me. Both her excellent prose and her development of the characters in the books were definite pluses. Not only was she adept at fleshing out the four characters telling the stories, but her attention to the supporting cast of characters was also well done. In addition, her ability to tell the story of Jesus from and alternate perspective and make it both believable, and more importantly, not disrespectful or preachy, was appreciated. As much as I enjoyed the book, at no time did the writing make me question my faith, or give me the idea that Ms. Alderman was trying to change my beliefs. Only that she was looking at the same story with different eyes. As I said, this book is not for everyone, but if you are looking for something that is a little different, looks at something from a totally different direction, and has the ability to bring to light questions and new information, than this is the book for you. I am giving it 4 stars, and in fact, enjoyed it much more than I thought I might. This book was provided to me by Little, Brown and Company through Netgalley in exchange for my review. I would like to thank them for the chance to read a book that I would probably not ever looked at on my own.

Honestly, read the one-star reviews just for laughs. Naomi Alderman retells the story of Israel under Roman occupation and beset by false messiahs, both religious and military. Being Jewish, Alderman does not believe that Jesus was a god and this novel is short on magic and miracles (although the Jews are desperately waiting for such and the early Christians believe they have found them.) If those are what you're looking to read about there are many more suitable books for you! As always, Alderman is brilliant with language and characterization. She uses characters from the Christian Gospels but treats them as complicated human beings living in the last days of the Second Temple, as Israel rebels again and again against the mightiest power on earth and is finally utterly destroyed and the Jews exiled for almost two thousand years. No character is left as a two dimensional hero or villain, and once again Alderman is Jewish and does not believe that Jesus was the Messiah, so if that sounds infuriating to you don't read this book: try The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis instead, or maybe Heaven Is Real by that six-year-old. If you are Jewish, or not allergic to a Jewish perspective on Jewish history, it is a gripping and tragic read, a powerful novel of historical fiction about a nation that looked for a savior in the face of annihilation and found none. And everyone should read Alderman's \"Disobedience: A Novel.\""}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4412069-stephen", "userReview": "interesting novel surrounding the life of Jesus and split into 4 different versions, took me awhile to get into this novel maybe it was the subject title."}, {"userName": "Samuel Rood", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20975593-samuel-rood", "userReview": "It was an interesting idea, writing a book about Jesus from a Jewish perspective, but I was very disappointed. The first century characters so obviously belonged in the 21st. None of the characters were believable and the character development was stale and predictable. Miriam (Mary) was the most interesting story, but the other three characters (Judah aka Judas, Bar Avo aka Barabbas, and Caiaphas) as well as their stories all fell flat. The cursing and the sexuality in the story so distracted from the world Alderman created that I wasn't able to enjoy it. Most significantly, the central character, Yehoshua (Jesus) was so one dimensional and unimpressive it is difficult to believe that anyone could have mistaken him for the Messiah. It would have been much more interesting if Alderman had left the question of Yehoshua's credentials open-as many Jewish Jesus scholars have done (i.e. Daniel Boyarin, and Amy-Jill Levine)-a question of faith. Alderman's Yehoshua was self-absorbed, arrogant, delusional, and erratic. He couldn't have been less compelling. I wasn't expecting him to be anointed Messiah or worshipped as Lord, but I wasn't prepared to think that he deserved to be crucified-as Alderman portrays him.

Her novel begins in 63 BC with Pompey's Roman army assailing the fortifications of Jerusalem, and ends with the bloodshed of the Jewish-Roman war in the first century CE.Within this context of Roman brutality and Jewish insurrection, Alderman presents the life and death of a charismatic Jewish preacher, Yehoshuah. A year after his death, four people tell their stories - his mother, Miryam; his former friend and follower Iehuda of Qeriot; the High Priest at the great Temple in Jerusalem, Caiaphas and the rebel, Bar-Avo.Read by Stephanie Racine and Tracy-Ann ObermanAbridged by Sally MarmionOne started and hoped for some historical insight, but the getting is only an imagined and romanticised intrigue.Move along, nothing to see.Produced by Emma HardingAuthor Note: Naomi Alderman grew up in the Orthodox Jewish community in north-west London. Her first novel, 'Disobedience', was published in ten languages and won the Orange Award for New Writers; like her second novel, 'The Lessons', it was read on BBC Radio 4's Book at Bedtime.

In so doing she has made biblical figures that are sometimes perceived as one dimensional characters and turned them into ones we can relate to, with depth and conflict and imperfection. Although at times it felt sacrilegious reading some points of view such as the Iehuda from Qeriot, it made you see how Jesus could have been perceived, at the time, in a negative but credible way; a rock star that started to believe the hype surrounding him and got carried away. Of course most believe this to be false as he indeed turned out to be the real deal, but at the time there must have been doubt and Jesus could have come across as a smug, arrogant heretical madman. i thought it was interesting to portray Judas as an over zealous man of God that became disillusioned and rebelled, throwing himself instead at the mighty feet of Rome. I enjoyed reading the part of Yehoshuah's mother, Miryam as you can see how she could have felt resentful and rejected by her son. It simply offered a more human account of an almost mythical character and brought life and reality to her. The characters that surround Yehoshuah are painted in fine detail through Alderman's alternative view point, but Yehoshuah himself is still presented, in my opinion, as a mysterious being that we are never able to get near. We see him through other's eyes. Yet by doing so we are constantly made aware that this is an individual's opinion which allows room for us as the reader to form our own. This is where the genius of this book lays; in the doubt, in the many eyes that reflect Jesus. This is all set against a backdrop of brutal Roman occupation, that often gets ignored surrounding the life of Jesus. I found this book fascinating, poetic, historically insightful and extremely provocative. I also appreciated the biblical motif that naomi incorporated into her style of writing, 'And it is Friday morning, and it is Friday evening. The Sabbath day.'"}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7583770-jackie", "userReview": "\"And in the midst of all that, one preacher by the name of Jesus died. And either something miraculous happened or someone lied.\"This is not the story of Yehoshuah (Jesus)but of the way his existence affected those around him. It is an often bloody tale of a people under Roman occupation, told from the perspectives of Miryam (his mother), Iehuda (a follower), Caiaphas (High Priest of Jerusalem) and Bar-Avo (rebel and murderer).The first half of the book is sublime. Miriam's feelings of betrayal, disappointment and loss in relation to her eldest son, and the strong love she had for him despite all these things, ring so true.My favourite \"chapter\" is that of Iehuda. A man who loses faith, finds it again in Yehoshuah and then loses it again when he feels that Yehoshuah is allowing himself to become the centre of things and more important than his message and his people.\"Losing one's faith is so very like gaining it. There is the same joy, the same terror, the same annihilation of self in the ecstasy of understanding. There is the same fear that it will not hold, the same wild hope that, this time, it will. One has to lose one's faith many times before one begins to lose faith in faith itself.\"After this it becomes more about a city under occupation and the clash between Rome and Jerusalem.

Alderman is a Jewish lady who allegedly writes about Jesus through four peoples perspective. Mary, Judas, Caiphaas and Barabas. Yet only the Mary and Judas section cover Jesus prominently. Caiphaas and Barabas only discuss Jesus peripherally. Even the sections which do cover Jesus more completely include complete lies with absolutely no backing which results in the uncomfortable feeling in reading the book. Jesus allegedly strikes Joseph. Joseph leaves Mary for another woman, Mary never finds that Jesus is gone from the tomb, Judas doesn't kill himself etc.The author cites very few sources for the tale she makes up. The few verses of the Bible she does cite are selective and misconstrued. She conveniently ignores the rest of the New Testament. I think this is an attempt by the author to write a controversial book that will sell many copies and make her famous. Sadly enough that may work in this world.

There are people, like Julius Caesar, whom we know existed, and about whom we know a fair amount. And then there are people like Helen of Troy, lost to pre-history, who as likely as not, never existed. Jesus of Nazareth is perched awkwardly between these two places, and to my mind, this made Naomi Alderman's story about life in Roman-occupied Jerusalem a quite haunting novel about how stories and myths come to be and about what can never be known for certain. And so we have a retelling of the parable of the talents which is quite different in its focus from the biblical account. And it is not Yehoshuah but the political insurrectionist, Bar Avo, who persuades the fishermen of Galilee to throw their lot in with him. It's beautifully written and to this admittedly uneducated reader, the evocation of life in 0BCE Jerusalem feels spot-on. I don't know if her description of the lines of crucifixes on the road into Jerusalem as screaming trees is originally her own but either way, it's a perfect metaphor for the horrors of crucifixion, which Alderman reminds us, was hardly an exceptional mode of judicial killing at the time (somehow, I can't help but picture Mark Lanegan being attracted to the image, which makes me wonder if it is older). I liked the way that the book took a well-established story (although one where I'm embarrassingly reliant on a primary school Church of England version which left out a lot of the awkward details) and looked at it from a different angle \u2013 presenting Judas as a disillusioned follower who fears that his leader is becoming a cultish demagogue, and Caiaphas not as a cynical man seeking to get rid of a trouble-maker making life difficult for the temple, but as a pragmatic leader in a febrile, difficult environment, doing what he thinks will best protect his people from the might of the Roman Empire.It's not without its flaws \u2013 the Epilogue would have been better presented as an author's afterword as it's essentially a \u201cjust in case you didn't get it, my point is that the myth of Jesus was bad news for the Jews\u201d and she'd made that point well enough in the main body of the novel. I was also never quite sure she'd really explained quite why Pontius Pilate had decided to let the people of Jerusalem decide which of Barrabus/Bar Avo and Yehoshuah/Jesus should live and which should die \u2013 surely a Roman Prefect would want to be shot of the political insurrectionist, and be largely indifferent to the fate of a religious mystic? But perhaps I'd missed the point, maybe Pontius Pilate simply wasn't meant to be very clever.[4.5 but I'm rounding up]"}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5447359-renee", "userReview": "The Liars' Gospel: A Novel, fictional book on the life of Jesus, is a visually telling read and gives a realistic look into how people lived, thought, loved, and hated back in Biblical times. There are three main sections which are three very different stories, each revolving around a time, place, verse, or person from the Bible.For example, part one focuses on the life of Jesus from birth to his resurrection and how he was perceived by the family who gave him mortal life. Instead of writing about how his family revered him from the day he was born, the author instead delves into the tough matters of how his differences became too much for his family, eventually breaking it up.Interesting read for those that have read the Bible or have a little knowledge of who the people where inside the Bible, or for anyone who likes to read period fiction.

It's excellent. Read it.I have quite a number of retellings of the Christ myth, so if I tell you that this may be the best, even better than The Good Man Jesus And The Scoundrel Christ, believe it is good. It says something so widely overlooked and even forgotten but so obvious - this is a Jewish story. In traditional Jewish communities, where the rituals and observations and practice in everyday life is kept alive, as it was without change for millennia, the past is not some distant thing, nor some mythical land. It is there by your side, it is living. There is an unbroken chain stretching back from this day to that day, through the centuries, in which people like you said this prayer, people like you broke this bread. The world may be different but people don't change. Miriam (Mary, mother of Christ) is a Jewish mother who hoped for nothing more than for her son to grow up and marry and give her grandchildren. Now he is gone and he has not even left her grandchildren to grieve with, nor help her as she grows old. Iehuda of Kerioth (Judas Iscariot) is a man seeking a return to a more pure and authentic faith in the time of Roman-occupied Judea, when the temple leader is appointed by Rome, by the emperor, by a man claiming to be a living god, in blasphemy. Yet his faith seems unfounded when the new firebrand reformist preacher he follows begins to espouse the same blasphemies of being a living god. Caiaphas is a man holding a difficult peace, preserving his people's way of life and making concessions to its conquerors, trying to mitigate the all-powerful might of Rome and reign in the more extreme elements among his own people who could bring the troubled peace crashing down. And Bar-Avo (Barabbas) is a resistance fighter, a terrorist, a freedom fighter, a criminal, a man who kills his own people as well as the enemy if he believes they have collaborated or become complacent about their degradation. These people could be now as they were then. People holding difficult peace. People seeking freedom and an authentic religious life. People enduring through grief and disappointment. Nothing is mysticised or otherised. And Alderman's writing is so good, these are rich, full, identifiable people.The book is composed of four parts, each narrated in first person by each of the characters. The book is bookended though with a prologue and an epilogue, detailing the first and second sieges of Jerusalem. This gives context to the world these characters inhabit. It is vital to understand what the overarching, defining force was in this world. That every person reacts and lives in reference to this situation. Pompey conquers Jerusalem, he slaughters the temple's men, violates the holiest place in the temple with his heathen presence, and makes the temple leaders appointees of Rome. The religio-ethnic tension between the occupying force and the occupied stems from this. And the fact that the Jews live and worship is a gift merely by the mercy of Rome, and not their right as free people. And their religious leadership becomes a political tool of their oppressor, permanently entangling the struggle for political freedom with religious purity and authenticity. When the book ends, it ends with the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, who believes that the mercy shown to the Jews has not been met with gratitude, and for their defiance, destroys their city utterly. A million people in Jerusalem were starved, slaughtered or hacked through, the buildings of the city razed, the temple burnt and the Holiest of Holies defiled and destroyed. The Jews are scattered to the four winds, those that survived, and must continue on.Once it establishes this historical setting, what makes this book amazing is how sympathetic everyone is in their own way, even when they have diametrically opposed viewpoints. Alderman's writing is so good that with each new character you are brought in and totally on their side, even while recognising their flaws. I loved her portrayal of Iehuda (Judas). I've seen many sympathetic portrayals of Judas in various media, I didn't expect anything particularly new from this one. Yet I got it. Many portrayals of Judas are of a man mistakenly doing what he thinks is the lesser of two evils, or a man racked with ambivalence and remorse. Alderman's Iehuda is neither. He is a man who desperately needs his faith in God and believes Yehoshuah (Jesus) is the one to lead a truly revolutionary reform of the religion, return Judea to a real relationship with God who seems to have abandoned them to occupation. The corruption of the temple leaders who allow a blasphemous, living god to be sacrificed to in the temple every day, the idolatry of the coinage being minted with graven image of that living god, the transformation of their most holy and pious religious positions into political positions won with favours and wealth, where contemplation is not on the spiritual but on the machinations of empire - all these draw him to this new cult. He is heart and soul devoted to it. So when Yehoshuah (Jesus) starts to show the same corruption, same blasphemy, same politicking, by claiming to be a living god, by allowing himself to be anointed in expensive oils as gestures of wealth, by playing favourites amongst his followers about who is in his inner circle of \"disciples\", Iehuda (Judas) can't stand it. For him, it Yehoshuah (Jesus) who betrays him, not the other way around. In fact Yehoshuah (Jesus) betrays the whole cause. And for Iehuda (Judas) it is a true return to God to report him to the authorities, a true act of devotion to the one true God to renounce this imposter. He is not ambivalent, but happy. He has done the right thing. He is reunited with the true faith.Caiaphas is just as interestingly portrayed. Caiaphas is widely discussed by the other characters as being corrupt, and he is, just not as they think. Caiaphas does not see himself as religiously corrupt. He knows he has made concessions to Rome, but he thinks he has won more battles than he has lost, and he has mitigated a lot of the worst excesses of Rome. For him, the most important thing of all is to ensure the continuation of the temple, the daily sacrifices to God, the sanctity of the Holiest of Holies, the ability to wash out his people's sin when he meets with God on Yom Kippur. All else is secondary. There must be peace for the temple to continue, the relationship with God is all that matters. So what if it is undignified? So what if there is injustice? So what if the Romans kill the young men and everyone is too afraid to stop them? Your dignity, your justice and your grief should not be as important as your dedication to God. Call yourself pious? Yet you would risk bringing down their wrath on us all, risk them destroying the temple? True adherence to the faith would require that the preservation of the relationship with God in paramount. Therefore any concession to that end is justified. What is really good in this chapter is that Caiaphas meets Pilate. Pilate wants temple gold to pay for building an aqueduct, and doesn't understand or care that this would sacrilegious, for gold dedicated to the glory of God to be used by Rome's emissaries for projects of their liking. And Pilate bursts out into a rant, that despite the fact he is set up as the antagonist, is massively sympathetic, especially to me as someone without faith. He brays that everything that's in this city is holy, the gold is holy, the food is holy, the building is holy, the coins are (un)holy, everything - EVERYTHING - is a source for religious offence. He's trying to build an aqueduct to bring you clean water, you fucking backwards peasants, and you're too fucking superstitious to even appreciate what's trying to be done for you! It is a great scene, in which Pilate's absolute rightness and wrongness is played off this arbitrator who knows that there will be riots and death as a result of this man's pigheadedness towards those he's been set over to rule. It's every occupation ever. Why don't you love my mercy you idiots!The last chapter is of Bar-Avo (Barabbas), whose name means \"son of his father\" and therefore is understood to be a nom de guerre. He is a resistance fighter, a savvy, smart, quick and ruthless leader who spends his life fighting to free Judea from Roman rule. He has no tolerance for those who capitulate to Rome, who pander to the Romans, who ease their way, who collaborate to bring about a subjugated Judea, and in this other Jews are as much his enemy as the Romans. He commits random acts of \"terror\" to ensure people never become complacent about Roman rule. The peace Caiaphas so desperately craves is Bar-Avo's (Barabbas) greatest nightmare and defeat. He resists to the end, until as an old man, with his band of loyal Zealots, they storm the temple and kill its Rome appointed leaders. For which, Rome pays them back in spades.So where is Yehoshuah (Jesus) in all this? He is far from the centre of things. He is of greatest importance to his mother, and barely remember by Caiaphas and Bar-Avo (Barabbas). He has a decent following, but no more really than a lot of other reformist, messianic, apocalyptic cults had at the time. Does he pose a threat to the temple leaders? Not in a religious sense, but he is an embarrassment to them because they are tasked with keeping the population docile under Roman rule. A few of his scattered followers believe he has risen from the dead, but since no one sees him, they figure that his body was simply stolen in order to be given a proper burial. Not even his mother really believes. This is a retelling of the Christ myth in which Christ is a minor character. Why he said what he said, why he did what he did, why he died how he died, is what's important. He himself is but a shadow. The negative space where religion and politics collide in an occupied land.Absolutely read this book. This may be my longest review ever. That's how much I enjoyed this book. Read it. Read it now."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4856618-paul", "userReview": "I thought I was going to like this - that's why you checked it out of the library Paul you dumbdumb - but I REALLY liked it! A piece of historical fiction set in the time of Roman occupied Judea, early in the first century CE. Before the first of four parts begin there is an introduction that perfectly sets the tone for much of what lies ahead: The ritual sacrifice of a lamb in the Jerusalem temple (that's THE Temple of course, Herod the Great's rebuilt version of King Solomon's earlier destroyed Temple) is accounted for in considerable detail. A twice daily performed ceremony of utmost importance in the Judean (or 'Jewish') religion, the description is at once something that made this reader feel equal parts queasy and awe-inspired. The slaughter is given the context of the daily ceremonial life of the Temple, and the various sacrificial offerings large and small made by the faithful visiting pilgrims rich and poor alike. Then the Romans arrive...General Pompey's forces occupy Jerusalem and eventually take control of the Temple. Under his command the conquering army is obviously tough, but actually reasonably considered and fair. His orders are to not desecrate the temple. The Roman Empire permits the occupied Judeans to carry on with the worship of their God Yahweh.With this setup complete the story begins. It is broken into four parts - each telling a story from the point of view of (in order) - Miryam (Mary), a mother in Nazareth whose eldest son Yehoshua (Jesus) was crucified in Jerusalem a year earlier; Yehuda Ish-Karyot {man of Kariot} (Judas Iscariot), a former disciple of the same Yehoshua thought to be dead, but actually living as a reinvented Romanised gentleman of the regional port town Caesaria; Caiaphas, the Cohen HaGadol or High Priest of the Temple; and finally Bar-Avo (Barabbas), an anti-Roman rebel leader.Alderman does a superb job at convincingly portraying 1st century life in Roman Israel as it really might have been. The sights, sounds and smells of various markets, villages, bath-houses, and homes of the rich and poor, Roman and Jew, really come across. The food and drink is lavishly accounted for - a good selection of olives, figs, white cheeses and a nice glass of wine will go nicely with this book! {SPOILERS AHEAD}Gideon, a boy escaped from an anti-Roman riot in Jaffa, and one who it turns out knew, and followed, the crucified teacher Yehoshua, turns up frost-bitten and nearly dead one winter up in the high hills of Galilee that surround Nazareth. Once nursed back to health he becomes a goat herd and domestic help in Miryam's house. We learn that her husband Yosef has upped and left. The Romans are on the trail and come looking for the escaped one from Jaffa, and Miryam risks the whole village's safety by lying about how long he's been staying with them. At first Miryam is resentful of the fact that this boy seems to have known her son in a way that she could not in the last year or two of his life, and doesn't really want a daily reminder that he went off the rails so to speak and was killed in punishment by the Romans. But at the same time she is glad to have someone in the home who is interested in her recollection of her departed son as a boy. Gideon's stated love for her son's teachings somehow seem to keep his memory alive for her.Yehuda is portrayed as a very complex and sensitive man, and one who thinks quite deeply. Living as an 'enslaved guest' in the home of a wealthy Roman citizen and merchant, Yehuda's party-piece, at his host's behest, is to tell that strange story of the one in Jerusalem who thought he was the King. As with Conrad's Marlowe, Alderman has her character tell the story as a sequence of past events. Yehuda tells how much he loved his wife, and that he almost didn't recover from her sudden death. Once he has encountered a small group of men banded together in the company of their Nazarene teacher, he throws his lot in with them and becomes an especially passionate believer in his ministry. As the group grew and attracted increasing attention, Yehuda finds himself somewhat at odds with Yehoshua's seemingly carefree attitude to those proclaiming him the Annointed One, the Messiah. The episode of Lazarus' sister Mary annointing Jesus' feet with a pint of very expensive spikenard oil (John 12:1\u201310), just before the Passover in Bethany, is reworked by Alderman with considerable verve. Yehuda doesn't understand why such an expensive ointment (worth a labourer's annual wage) wasn't sold to feed the poor, and doesn't understand his teacher's vague response. He becomes increasingly disillusioned...Caiaphas' story is interesting in that it is told in almost complete isolation from the story of Jesus. We learn of the daily comings and goings of a privileged and powerful family. The High Priest is in effect the 'spiritual leader' of the local Jewish population, and as such it is fascinating to see the portrayal of the relationship between the occupied and the occupier. (I couldn't help but draw my own clumsy analogy with the current situation in Israel regarding the 'autonomous' Palestine Authority... but that's another conversation for another day.) His concerns are primarily with the purity of his own soul - which extends to the purity of his wife's soul - as every year on the holy Day of Atonement - Yom Kippur - he must proffer himself before God in the Temple's inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies - where only the High Priest must ever step, and only on that day. A Rope will be tied to his ankle so that he may be pulled out should the Lord smite him there and then as has happened before. Understandably he is preoccupied with his own suspicions of his wife's infidelity as it can truly be a matter of life and death.The events surrounding the arrest and crucifixion of a strange and rabble-rousing teacher from Galilee are told from Caiaphas' perspective almost as an aside in his ongoing struggle with Pilate over the supply of Temple monies for civic projects - forbidden by Jewish law. There is the disturbing episode of a mob disrupting the Temple one year in the days before Passover, upsetting the tables and assaulting the money-changers... Nevertheless, the simmering atmosphere of pending rebellion, disorder and faithlessness is brewing all the time.Which leads the story of The Liars' Gospel nicely to Bar-Avo's tale. His name (not his given name) means \"His Father's Son\" in Hebrew, and we learn why that is so, and why his actual name is never used. Alderman tells Barabbas' story almost as though he were Mario Puzo's young Vito Corleone on his way up through the ranks of hoodlums and made men who run the black markets and smuggle the weapons around the Roman garrison controlled Jerusalem. There are several episodes of violent revolt which lead to Bar-Avo's arrest and the subsequent encounter with Yehoshua/Jesus we're familiar with. His place on the Roman cross is taken by 'King of the Jews' who doesn't appear to have as many friends in town as the king of the wise guys... A long career in increasingly political anti-Imperialist rebellion unfolds for Bar-Avo, yet somehow he prospers, seeming to live a charmed life. He finds himself on occasion thinking back to his moments in the same cell beneath the Prefect's house when he talked with the Nazarene about God and faith, and is thankful that it was not he who died on the cross that Passover.I'd be giving this the full five stars if it wasn't for the slightly heavy-handed way that the epilogue explains why the gospel may be the liars' gospel of the title. I thought it would've been wiser to leave the reader to decide for themselves. On the whole though, this was a very believable and enjoyable imagined story of some of the major figures in Jesus' days, and how we should always be wary of history's perspectives.

The four narrators are all known by their Jewish names, Miryam (Mary), Iehuda of Qeriot (Judas Iscariot), Caiaphas, and Bar-Avo (Barabbas), while Jesus is consistently referred to as Yehoshuah. Yehoshuah borrows a lot of old rabbinical teachings (the Golden Rule is not original to Christianity) mixed with a few visionary notions (\"Love your enemies\" _is_ original), but he's also well-versed in a variety of charlatan's techniques and increasingly prone to megalomania as his following grows. Some reviewers argue that there's supposed to be a Rashomon quality to the depiction, but I felt as if there was a consistent psychology throughout, half wise rabbi and half manipulative cult leader.What's most interesting to me about Alderman's novel is how Yehoshuah is more the entry point to the story than the story itself: the novel begins in a brief prologue with the conquest of Jerusalem, and ends with the destruction of the Temple, and in between the story is largely concerned with issues of power and living under occupation. Thousands of Jews are executed by Rome over the course of the novel, of which Yehoshuah is only one. The possibility for violence exists as a constant background presence. Yehoshuah proposes the idea of loving your enemy as a radical ethic of nonviolence, but Alderman suggests that he's a little too in love with his own myth to take its implications seriously:[From Iehuda]'The man I first followed would never have wanted to king.''You know, I believe that is what Caesar said when he first took power. It seems to be a pattern with them. In this time of special emergency, they say, I must take more power than usual, but this shall be given back in time to the people. Somehow it is always a time of special emergency. It is quite surprising how seductive a crown can be.'Iehuda is shocked to learn how small his movement looks from the outside (Caiaphas refers to the 'inconvenience' caused); and halfway through, the novel moves on to where the power really lies and in the process becomes more Josephus than New Testament. High Priest Caiaphas is portrayed as a savvy political operator given the nearly impossible task of keeping the peace so that the Temple will continue to function. Bar-Avo is something like a professional insurgent, robbing Roman caravans and giving the money to villagers to win their support. Both are keenly intelligent and sharply limited, and their stories are the most immediately entertaining.However, I began to feel as if the frequent violence had become a bit numbing and repetitive, losing some of its power as the story went along. And Alderman sometimes fails to make Caiaphas and Bar-Avo convincing as 1st century characters. (A conversation in which Bar-Avo cannot believe that the Yehoshua cult will attract more followers than Juno is a classic example of heavy handed period piece irony.)I am a little biased in favor of the source material. I was raised in an evangelical Christian home, and while I have been an atheist for more than a decade I continue to be fascinated by books about the 'historical Jesus' and different ways of looking at the myths that I grew up with. So more than usual, my view of THE LIARS' GOSPEL is very subjective. But with that in mind, IMO Naomi Alderman did a fine job at re-casting the life of Jesus in a surprising (and insightful) new light."}, {"userName": "Jennifer S.

Once I picked it up, I was hard pressed to put it down. Historical novels as well as novels about religion fascinate me, and Alderman does such a great job of capturing the time period in such a way as to make the reader feel as if it's familiar. The story of Jesus/Yehoshuah as told from the point of view of four Jews is such a different way of looking at the story. In two of the sections, Yehoshuah is almost a minor character until you realize how heavily he has influenced the action of the story. The main question asked by this story is Was there truly a miraculous thing occurring or was everyone complicit in the greatest lie of all time? I imagine this could be deeply offensive to those with great Christian faith, but I found the book provocative and inspiring. It makes me want to know more.Naomi Alderman is an amazing writer, and while I enjoyed \"Disobedience,\" with \"Liars' Gospel,\" she has made a devoted reader and I look forward to whatever she conjures next."}, {"userName": "Virginia Rounding", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5435014-virginia-rounding", "userReview": "It may be a truism to say that if this book were a fictional account of the life of Mohammed, rather than of Jesus, Naomi Alderman would have had to take cover, but it is nevertheless the case.

It's poetic, sensory, emotional, and spare while not sacrificing passion. And the concept - the story of the Passion of Jesus from the point of view of four people surrounding him - is excellent. Alderman shows the complexity of Jewish society, and the different ways in which Rome is a constant presence in the lives of her characters. Historical figures are not allowed to remain static and distant, but brought to vivid, three-dimensional life.Much of what I found slightly disappointing about this novel may be down to the disconnect between the publicity I'd read about the book and the actual content. Obviously, this is not a problem with the novel itself, but rather with its marketing and the hype surrounding it.The blurb sets up the scene - Yehoshuah the preacher is crucified and soon his followers are saying he's risen again - and then feeds you the fantastic line, \"and then either something miraculous happened, or someone lied.\" I therefore went into this novel thinking the question of what happened to the body was going to be a major plot point - that each character would have their own idea of what happened on Easter morning - and expected this to really engage with the whole question of the resurrection. Instead, this point was glossed over -his followers claimed he rose again, but for the other characters, the line \"oh, and then someone, probably one of his followers, stole the body\" was repeated several times, and that was it. Again, that's not a problem with the book itself - if that wasn't the theme Alderman wanted to write about, fair enough - but the blurb was slightly misleading, and thus set me up to read what I thought was a very different book.Also, much of the publicity surrounding this book was about how daring and groundbreaking it was. I didn't find that to be the case - many of the characterisations are not unfamiliar to well-read Christians (Barabbas as freedom fighter, Pilate as spineless and bad at politics, Caiaphas doing the best he can to preserve what freedoms are left to them by Rome, Judas as the true believer who feels betrayed by Jesus and turns on him - all of this was present 60 years ago in Dorothy L. Sayers' \"The Man Born to be King\"), and while that obviously isn't the entirety of Alderman's intended audience, the fact remains that this concept is NOT exactly new, and the characterizations are pretty standard theology.The Epilogue, I felt, could have had its last three or four pages cut, when it changed from a fantastically atmospheric retelling of the sacking of Jerusalem into a lecture on the history of anti-Semitism in Christianity. Yes, it's highly symbolic from a literary point of view to show Rome elevating the Jewish man they killed and turning him on the Jews themselves - but Bar-Avo made that point himself very well in fiction, in his section, and it WORKED. It didn't need to be repeated, at length, in a style that came across as an essay instead of the epilogue of a novel.And finally, this may be a quibble, but the fact is that this is basic research, and when basic research isn't done, it throws me out of the whole narrative and makes it difficult for me to trust the author - but TOMATOES are a New World food. Nobody in the Middle East ate them until the 16th century, at least. And nobody outside India would have had aubergines until the establishment of the Silk Road, unless you were EXTREMELY important. To show Caiaphas' wife serving both of them in the same meal is ridiculous, and someone of Alderman's stature should have known better.I know this sounds really critical, but I did love the book and would recommend it to others. It's just that I tend to harp on the things I found difficult, rather than what I loved."}, {"userName": "Diane Adam", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23947859-diane-adam", "userReview": "The premise of this novel is that the stories which grew up around the life and death of Jesus, could have been based on lies.

Naomi Alderman gives an alternate telling of the time of Jesus, Yehoshuah in the Hebrew. Yehoshuah is Miryam's eldest son, but he is a disappointment to his father Yosef. Miryam starts the telling of the story creating fiction that Gidon, one of Yehoshuah's followers wants to hear. Iehuda, Judas in the latin, picks up the tale, then Caiaphas, the High Priest and lastly Bar-Avo, Barrabas. For those who are looking for another uplifting story of Jesus, don't pick up this book. Jesus is not a great man in this book. He is disturbed, perhaps a little mad. To be honest if you want an uplifting story at all, this is not the book for you.The period was a time of oppression and degradation. There are no heroes in this book. Each of the people who tell the story are deeply flawed. It is these flaws that drives the narrative as each talks about how their lives intersected the mad-man Yehoshuah. Of all the narrators, only one ends with any sense of hope whatsoever, yet given the bloody nature of this period of history that isn't surprising.It is that feeling that we are being given a glimpse into history that makes this novel compelling. There are many other stories of this time that gloss over the brutality of the conflict between Rome and the Jews. Naomi puts us deep into the conflict and shows the brokenness of both sides. There are no heroes; there are no winners. The tone reminds me of another book in which the world ends while the characters bicker about who is at fault. This is a book that prizes realism over a happy ending.\u2028\u2028To my mind the weakest part of the novel is the epilogue in which we step away from the personal narrative and are given a kind of apologia for the rise of Christianity.

It asks a very simple question: what might have happened, around 2000 years ago, to cause the rise of Jesus Christ and Christianity?It is a thought experiment. Jesus - Jehoshua - is not the protagonist of this story. He is very present, as all three narratives are tangential to his own, but our three protagonists are Myriam (his mother), Yehuda of Qeriot (Judas of Iscariot) and Bar-Avo (Barrabas the murderer). When I started reading the book, I expected those three narratives to intertwine, to be interconnected, to pull together and, because of the title, I expected someone to start conspiring, to start forming gospels, to intentionally lie...My expectations were wrong. This novel is comprised of three separate narratives. Their intersections are so brief and tangential that they are fundamentally irrelevant.Our first tale, Myriam's story, starts a year after the crucifixion, allows itself a flashback or two to Jehoshua's life, but is essentially the story of a woman who has to continue living with a certain trauma, and occasional reminders of her dead firstborn son.Our second tale, Yehuda's story, also starts after the crucifixion, also allows itself some flashbacks, and is the story of a man who has the faith equivalent of bipolar disorder: he is fervently faithful, loses all faith after a crisis, rediscovers faith (as Jehoshua enters his life), has doubts, ... He's a conflicted kind of guy.Bar-Avo, meanwhile, is an alpha male, a physical, rebellious lad's lad; a man who knows how to party, how to fight, how to buy friends. His story starts long before Jesus, and the crucifixion episode is merely a brief part of his life story.Three stories, three lives that intersect with Jesus', but Jesus himself is a shadow, an unknowable character. We hear everyone else's thoughts and interpretations, but we're never invited into Jesus' head. And rightly so, but it means that we are presented with three different Jesuses, each as much of a product of the way he is perceived by our current protagonist as a character of his own. There is a lot to praise about this book. The writing is elegant and slightly ornate - I found the writing voice beautiful. (In my experience, that means some others might dislike the style for being a bit purple prose-y. I think those others would be wrong: the writing here flows with flair. The beautiful phrases do not slow it down). The book is a work of some intelligence and thought. Each narrative is quite believable - although Bar Avo gets to have a perhaps somewhat too swashbuckling life, feels more like a character dropped out of a pirate story.However, there are also flaws. The biggest problem is that the book is just too self-consciously clever. As beautiful as the writing is, and as interesting as the thought experiment is, this book often feels like it has a bit of a smirk on its face. It's just a bit too smug. Bar Avo sounds like any Hamas or Islamic Jihad leader at times. The Romans are comparable in every way to Zionist Israelis today. The recurring theme of Jesus' disappeared body is a playful gimmick that never really has any payoff. We get some quotes from the Bible, used by characters other than Jesus, and we're supposed to cleverly chuckle at the fact that all these different moments and quotes got attached to one man, who said barely anything coherent at all... but there are no chroniclers in the book, no gospel makers. Some of the quotes are out of character to the new characters they are assigned to. I get the intention and the thoughts behind these things, but at those moments when the book is cleverest, it also stumbles and chokes and jars a little, because it disrupts the flow of a narrative.It's like jokes: writers of humorous stories often will spend a lot of time and energy slowly setting up a wonderfully witty, spectacularly funny moment. Think Douglas Adams, here. And then, as we wipe the tears of laughter form our eyes, we read the next sentence, and the story picks up again where it left off. Fine. But The Liars' Gospel isn't funny. It spends similar time and energy setting up a moment, but there is no relief through laughter. Instead, there is an \"a-hah\", but not even with an exclamation mark, not a major plot twist \"OMG!\", but a sort of polite and clever and mellow \"oh, I see what she did there, isn't she a clever one?\"... and then the story picks back up, and you feel a little deflated because you just had a literary hiccup, not a guffaw, a hiccup, not a heart-stopping twist, a clever polite little hiccup, and that's what all that was about? All in all, an interesting, clever, pleasant thought experiment, beautifully written, but just a little bit too focused on being clever, and a little too disjointed to be fully engrossing. Pleasant, rather than great.EDITED to add: I forgot about the Caiaphas sequence! Mea culpa! That sequence tells the story of a high priest with marital troubles (jealousy) and a dose of lust, whose life also intersects with Jesus' very briefly. Mostly it is a story of a man whose personal life is troubled, and whose public life is all about playing politics. He was difficult to like, Caiaphas, and so I'm not surprised I forgot all about him for a moment or two...Second edit: Sometimes, I wish Goodreads (and Amazon!) allowed half-stars, as this would be a 3.5/5 book for me. I initially rounded it down because, when I read it, there was a moment that threw me out of the narrative: I thought there was an inaccuracy which detracted from my confidence in the research. Alas, there wasn't: I'd misread something. So I amended the review, and decided to average the ratings - 4 stars on amazon, 3 on Goodreads."}], "description": "An award-winning writer re-imagines the life of Jesus, from the points of view of four people closest to him before his death. This is the story of Yehoshuah, who wandered Roman-occupied Judea giving sermons and healing the sick. Now, a year after his death, four people tell their stories. His mother grieves, his friend Iehuda loses his faith, the High Priest of the Temple tries to keep the peace, and a rebel named Bar-Avo strives to bring that peace tumbling down. It was a time of political power-play and brutal tyranny. Men and women took to the streets to protest. Dictators put them down with iron force. In the midst of it all, one inconsequential preacher died. And either something miraculous happened, or someone lied.Viscerally powerful in its depictions of the period - massacres and riots, animal sacrifice and human betrayal - The Liars' Gospel makes the oldest story entirely new.", "title": "The Liars' Gospel", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790915-the-liars-gospel", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1352225431l/15790915.jpg", "reviews": 207, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/118226.Naomi_Alderman", "name": "Naomi Alderman"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Religion", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790915-the-liars-gospel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18374746-the-liars-gospel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15726265-the-liars-gospel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15791474-the-liars-gospel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202677.Disobedience", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969858-doctor-who", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7534093-the-lessons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30729818-zombies-run"]}
