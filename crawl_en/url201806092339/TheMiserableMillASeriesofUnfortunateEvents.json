Because of all the eye symbols in the book? OMG I'M SO FREAKISHLY HILARIOUS. (To myself at least shhhh.) So I particularly enjoyed my reread of book because it's truly dastardly. And even when I first read them at 14, I loved how dark they could get. They're never graphic, but they are also 500% disturbing when you really think about it.So just put this together: sawmill + hypnotised Baudelaires + Count Olaf being evil = SURELY NOTHING WILL GO WRONG AND NO ONE'S LIMBS WILL BE SAWED OFF. #legitAnd I also LOVE how the Baudelaires are forced to swap their talents! It's really interesting and I love how they never fail to work together. This time Violet had to do some research and reading while Klaus invented something in a death defying moment.Sunny doing a sword fight with her teeth, however, I can't quite...I just...how.Definitely one of my favourite books in the series because IT'S SO FREAKING UNFAIR. Which is basically what this series is about of course. Don't read it.

It\u2019s not so much \u201cfun villainy\u201d to me as it is \u201cextremely stressful stuff of nightmares.\u201dSo not necessarily the most consistently pleasant reading experience.HOWEVER there is a really cool part of this book! The Baudelaire orphans, up to this point, have very narrow and consistent, like, specializations? What do you call the constant semi-adult-ish habits and passions of a child I do not know. Anyway: Violet invents, Klaus reads, Sunny bites.In this book, Violet reads! And Klaus invents! It\u2019s kind of a fun thing of, like, hey children of the world, you do not need to limit yourself. You can be good at a lot of things, even if someone is better at them than you. Woohoo!Count Olaf\u2019s role in this book is very limited, and therefore not as AMAZING as he normally is in the other books (villain-wise). But there are some great characters in this one! I love Phil. Also there is a gay partnership in this book and no one can tell me otherwise and so there.Bottom line: Not the best book in this series. Maybe the worst?

I'm now 100% positive that I didn't read these books as a child. Perhaps if I did, I would like them better now but unfortunately I feel lukewarm at best about this series. I just feel like these stories go around and around in circles and I'm quite tired of it. I like the kids but the story just isn't working for me anymore. This was probably my least favourite book so far but thinking about it now, the mill was probably one of the stronger stories.

It still truly astonishes me how horrible the adults in these books are no matter how many times I read them. The way they treat the children is absolutely appalling but I think that's part of the charm of this series. The poor Baudelaires can just never get a break! That's what makes this series real though because a lot of the time in real life, orphans do have terrible experiences and bounce around from home to home.

Don't get me wrong - it's still a fun read with plenty of cleverness and wit, and Celyn still seems to be enjoying me reading her the stories. It's also worth noting that this volume has the lowest average rating on Goodreads of all 13 books in the series, so I'm hopeful things will improve. In this book the established formula is applied with little or no variation. The bad point, for me, though was the descent into truly cartoon writing. In all the books before the world was similar to ours, bizarre, but largely believable. Normal laws of physics applies, things were internally consistent.In The Miserable Mill many things are wholly surreal and/or plain don't make sense.Some random examples:i) The signs being made out of chewed up chewing gum ... why?ii) The Boss having no name and his face being wholly concealed by smoke from his cigar the entire time - that steps into a kind of silly that is very different from the previous books' silliness. I cannot see in my mind a cloud of smoke from a cigar that is totally impenetrable and moves with someone.iii) A log being sawed is moved from its path (where it is held by the fact the circular saw is halfway through its length) by a child with a strip of metal using only the force that can be applied through the adhesion of a piece of chewing gum stuck to both the log and the metal strip.iv) A baby has a lengthy 'sword fight' with a grown and murderous woman. The woman is using a sword and the baby ... is using her teeth. We are repeatedly told that the teeth and sword clash.If the books had begun like this I would be ok with us being in a cartoonish world where that kind of thing happens (though I still wouldn't be able to visualize the sword fight in any satisfactory manner). But the first three books aren't like that (though they do move slowly in that direction) and in book 4 is comes as an unwelcome non sequitur.

Same style, but different situations. I think the Baudelaire children can really look out for themselves, so the plot needs to get more in depth. Just like the previous book, \"The Wide Window\", this series is trying to take a darker and more mature lane... so I guess children below 8 years old will not appreciate this book.

The three orphans, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, are sent again to a new home that was acquired by Mr. Poe, their guardian. Will the three children finally escape the clutches of Count Olaf, and his dastardly crew? Could Violet, Klaus, and Sunny find their perfect home? Lemony Snicket (author and narrator) states that you can find out a lot of information about a book by it's first sentence, but the title of the novel can give enough information, too. The Miserable Mill is another rendition of the unfortunate, dismal tale of the Baudelaire's life. Disclaimer: There is child labor laws that are broken in this novel, and abuse. If that makes you feel nauseated I wouldn't recommend these books. Adults were not physically beating the children, or is it graphic by any means, but it is considered abuse to treat minorities this way. I am finally caught up to the Netflix series, which is great by the way. Neil Patrick Harris is hilarious as Count Olaf, and I love him for it. I mean I loved him for other reasons, but he just becomes greater in my book. I can't wait for the next season to be released. I was laughing so hard at the show that my husband thought I was going crazy. I will say for the most part the books and t.v series are similar. Both of them are just ridiculous, and I do have some questions to ask of adults. I do recommend the Netflix series. The one problem I do have with the series is the same basic events happen over and over again, which could be a little redundant and boring. I like to know how everything plays out for our young heroes, but it may take me some time to finish the series, since I basically know how things are going to end up by the end of each book. It makes more sense to read this when the books were released. Maybe, I would be more surprised, or more daring to read the next book, but all the books are out. Thirteen books to be exact, and I have a feeling they are going to nearly escape Count Olaf clutches in most of them. I could be wrong. I would love to be wrong. SURPRISE ME!Why did I give it 3.5 stars? I love how the books are written. I love the witty sarcasm, and I love the definitions that are in the book. I think putting definitions in a book is great for young readers. I never looked up words I didn't know when I was younger. I love the kindle for this reason, where I can just click on a word and figure it out. I LOVE IT! These books are a quick read, too. It took maybe two hours to complete, which is great for me at the moment. I like how dark and twisted Lemony Snicket writes for younger readers, but still really corny. This book felt like a black and white horror film. It wasn't too scary, and the special effects are just ridiculous, but it still held my interest. Lastly, there is something humorous about all the adults. I find them all funny, especially Count Olaf and his hundreds of disguises. How far will this guy go for some money? Determined, and super focus at the task. He could of done something better with his life with that personality. haha. In general, I think this series is different from other books, where everything is just dark and dismal all the time. Will there ever be a happy ending? Hoping. I can be an optimist at times. Lastly, as adults are we blind? Do we not take children's word for what is happening in the world? As adults are we just super focused on our tasks that children's stories don't seem priority? I hope that we take children's thoughts, worries, etc into account, sometimes. I know sometimes I don't always listen to my daughter, but she doesn't fully express her issues, yet. Maybe, I should sit and listen more often. It is funny when she pretends plays now.

There are a lot of hints since the beginning of the presence of the Count, way more than the other times. This made it a little less exciting to discover who he was or when it would be introduced.It was a very fast read and the story overall was fun and enjoyable anyway, well detailed and there are a lot of characters.The book was hard to put down because I just liked the idea so much that I wanted to know what was happening straight away.And I liked that this time there are less \"which here means\" and there are the explanations made as examples that I found more interesting.Oh and I like that every time at the end there's the little note where there's a little introduction for the next book as well as the title, I love the way it's written.Till the next tragedy ;)"}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew", "userReview": "And so another series I started and never got round to finish is returned to. Carrying on my challenge to finish series I started and some how never got round to finishing I have now started back on the Series of Unfortunate Events.

(you get the idea) terrible the life of the Baudelaire orphans has got and is yet to get. I understand its how the author has approached the narrative but it does grate some times. The second is that it feels like it could easily slip in to a formulaic story where each episode is a re-telling of the same premise - over and over again where the children call it out and the authorities first ignore then and then choose to act just a little too late. However book 4 the Miserable Mill shows that is NOT the case - here we are introduced to a new story and one which shows that there is potential for this series to go places I cannot predict or expect - suddenly it has become fresh again.

Additionally to the mental abuse known from previous stories, now they are also suffering from physical ones, working several hours a day while starving. As if that was not bad enough, we also face some mind-control tools, lots of bubblegums and even a death in this story.
