I hope not!Those are the grunts of the undead.Sheriff Penny Miller, you stole my heart when I first learned of you in the Hungry debut. Now you have rightfully brought it back again with some sweet justice in continuing to kill slobbering, rotting, stinky-assed walking corpses.Miller was a unique specimen. The only living person to have received both the zombie virus and the antidote. She went to hell and back and survived. Her nightmares testify to the fact that the last thing she wants is to be back in zombie central to pick up dirty laundry, a place where she and her friends almost died.She is given options: money and freedom for her band of men to get in and out before anyone knows. Back to the unforgiving and hidden violence of the desert plagued with the undead. They promised them greener pastures in return \u2013 and money. Will they be able to spend the money?What people would do for money and freedom.Has Sheriff Penny Miller bargained for more than she can handle?\u201cHell no!\u201d I say. She is one of the toughest gals you\u2019re gonna find on this darn earth, and with plenty of heart.One thing for sure is she and her band of men know what\u2019s to be expected in the unforgiving barren land, and this time \u2018round they\u2019re experienced in killing the undead.We also learn Penny\u2019s heart is as big as the desert she walks on. She\u2019s a wounded soul emotionally and needs some loving.Oh yeah. Another thing is they are in a race against time.There is a clock ticking from 26 hours and 36 minutes down to zero, the annihilation of the zombie zone. Which will then be known as a nuked zone!This second installment involving Sheriff Penny and the zombie outbreak is more fast-paced than the first. Sheriff Penny is not in a wedding dress this time around, just basic apparel; a vest. And she is to be put through one of the greatest tests of her life. Her friendship with her comrades is also under a test and she must know who to trust.In this installment, Sheriff Penny meets an equal of sorts in the shape of Major Francine Hanratty, dubbed Rat by her peers. Together they fight for leadership with Penny and her comrades and Rat\u2019s comrades in tow. They must get through this together in order to survive.Las Vegas had been abandoned and Nevada been placed under quarantine until the whole thing gets resolved.They will find themselves outnumbered, under-supplied, and behind enemy lines again.In zombie central they find life not of the undead but in the form of a strange man who talks of belief and minions of the evil one. He\u2019s just what this story needs, an interesting addition to the already colourful characters within in this story. (For the newcomers, this book can be read without reading the debut.)The already large following of Sheriff Penny Miller will be up in arms rejoicing this fun, fully-loaded, brain entrails explosion of a high-octane charged zombie story.Miller still displays plenty of humour and common sense. For example: \u201cMiller had learned a long time back that a man in lust was also unguarded and dumb as a fence post.\u201dAlso, Rat, with an equal sense of humour: \u201d \u2018What about them [the zombies]?\u2019 snapped Rat. \u2018They\u2019re unarmed, unarmored, uncoordinated, and from what I understand, dumber than dog shit. Like I said, one headshot takes them out. That\u2019s a piece of cake for a first-rate team of marksmen. What are you so worried about, Dale? \u2018 \u201c Review also @ http://more2read.com/review/the-hungry-2-the-wrath-of-god-the-hungry-2-by-harry-shannon-steven-w-booth/Also info on purchasing the book @ http://geniusbookpublishing.com/book/the-hungry-2/"}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/783046-jason", "userReview": "When I was a kid, I loved movies like Aliens and Predator. A big reason for this was the awesome monsters that the military heroes had to kill. Another big reason was the character of the heroes themselves. At that time in my life, I had dreams of joining the military so I could go on similar adventures, albeit without the monsters, because in these movies along with some books I was reading, the heroic military men and woman were a lot like the monsters: bigger than life and stronger than any mortal man. Even when and if they died. The beginning to Steven Booth\u2019s and Harry Shannon\u2019s sequel to the great The Hungry made me reminisce of those older movies and the emotions they summoned within my impressionable and young heart. In Wrath of God we first meet Rat and her team of military mercenaries who are on their way to Nevada for a mission with an odd catch. There are zombies in the desert, and their mission is of the upmost importance.When we rejoin Penny Miller and crew, they are held up in a Las Vegas hotel by the military. General Gifford, however, has other plans for them. He offers the crew a deal that will see them out of Las Vegas with a crap load of money. All they have to do is join up with the mercenaries and return to the scene of the crime from the climax of the first book to retrieve some data.Sounds easy, right? Penny doesn\u2019t think so. In fact, she thinks that the deal stinks, and what follows is a one crazy and fun and entertaining moment after another. What I liked most about Wrath of God is the fun factor. I would even go so far as to say that this volume is even more fun than the first. The characters remain true to themselves as they did in the first, and the new characters, mainly Rat, another hard-edged, ass-kicking female protagonist, was a lot of fun to read. Yet, some of the mercenary\u2019s felt a little flat to me, reminding me of hulk-like men, doing what their told while grunting their displeasure and scratching at their privates.There were also a few scenes at the end that just didn\u2019t seem very realistic to me, but with that said, I am reminded of Sigourney Weaver hanging from one arm in a decompression airlock opened to the big black abyss of space. Large metal crates whip quickly by her head from the vacuum, and yet Sigourney\u2019s harm does not tear off at the shoulder. I also remember Arnold Swartzaneggar stumbling out of the remnants of an explosion equal to that of a nuclear bomb with nothing more than a limp. Sure, his mind was completely gone, but he was relatively unharmed. Right? It\u2019s these things that made these heroes larger than life and worth every inch of my childhood admiration. And I would argue that it\u2019s the same with the heroes in The Wrath of God. They\u2019re as tough as metal, and one would want to double check their sanity in messing with them.Oh yeah, and there\u2019s lots of Zombies. How could you possibly want more?"}, {"userName": "Frank Errington", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3553381-frank-errington", "userReview": "The wedding dress may be gone, but Sheriff Penny Miller is back. If you don't get the reference, then you haven't read The Hungry, a situation you truly ought to rectify ASAP.When last we saw Sheriff Penny Miller, she and a band of misfits had managed to get away from the Crystal Palace, the Top Secret base that was birthplace of the zombie apocalypse. Now, the military wants them to return, in an effort to retrieve vital information. Information that may lead to a cure or, in the wrong hands, could make things a whole lot worse.Penny doesn't want to do it, but when the Government lays a whole lotta money on the table and when everyone else opts in, somebody's gotta go to try and keep them all from all from becoming Zombie chow.To make matters worse, for Penny and her crew, they are burdened with a team of top notch military types, led by Major Francine Hanratty--dubbed Rat by her peers. They've been pulled from the middle of a firefight halfway around the world and for what? Zombies? They aren't too happy, either.No time is wasted getting into the action in The Hungry 2: The Wrath of God. I love the way the writers, Steven W. Booth and Harry Shannon give the characters fun dialog, \"dead as a Kardashian New Year's resolution come February\" and \"If brains were leather you wouldn't have enough to saddle a June bug.\" being fine examples.There are more than a few delicious twists to keep you guessing, including what's up with \"The WrATh of GoD!\" they keep seeing written on walls here and there.True, if you only ready literary masterpieces, this might not be for you, but if you read for fun and if you're looking for a great summer read for that weekend at the beach, the lake, your cabin in the woods or even curled up on the sofa in your air-conditioned living room. This is the one, especially if you have a hankerin' for some Zombies.Considering I've noticed where the books are now being tagged as The Sheriff Penny Miller Series I wouldn't be surprised to see The Hungry 3 somewhere down the line.The Hungry 2: The Wrath of God is available for pre-order from Apple iBookstore on iTunes. http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-h...On July 6, 2012, The Hungry 2: The Wrath of God will be available from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Apple iBookstore, and from your local and online bookstores throughout North America and Europe, and Australia."}, {"userName": "Ashley Byland", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4021669-ashley-byland", "userReview": "As soon as I finished The Hungry, I knew right away that there was going to be another book and that I wanted it RIGHT AWAY! Sadly, I didn\u2019t get it right away, probably because it was written yet, lol. When I got an e-mail from Genius publishing, who published The Hungry asking if I wanted an ARC of The Hungry 2: The Wrath of God to read and review I was beyond excited.The story of Sheriff Penny Miller and her clan is a story that is just enthralling. Scratch \u2013 the biker/convict, kind of sexy guy, Terril Lee \u2013 Penny\u2019s ex husband and Sheppard \u2013 the sexy but gay scientist, this team is a team you do not want to mess with. At the end of The Hungry I for sure thought that Penny was a goner, but I was so excited to see what would happen to the bunch after they killed HORDES of zombies.In the second installment of The Hungry, Penny and the gang barely have time to rest and heal their wounds before the army makes them go back to crystal palace, the birthplace of the zombies. Before they even think about going back, Penny knows this is a horrible idea, and she is right of course. The twist and turns that come out of this book are just simply put, awesome. I caught myself yelling and screaming and cheering at my kindle. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.The Wrath of God \u2013 those words make you wonder what is going on, and when this phrase really comes into play in this book, it is very surprising and sickening (you will totally understand why when you get there) but it works SO well with this story. This just made me fall in love with Penny Miller all over again, and it will REALLY make you love Scratch as well. These guys have done it again with the Hungry 2: The Wrath of God, I cannot wait for you all to read it, it\u2019s a ride you just don\u2019t want to get off and I cannot wait for the next book!!"}, {"userName": "Steven Booth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4494435-steven-booth", "userReview": "Harry and I are very excited about The Hungry 2: The Wrath of God. As the sequel to The Hungry, it has a big reputation to live up to. We feel that this is a better book, a more sophisticated read, while being just as exciting as the first book. Sheriff Penny Miller is back. After being rescued from Crystal Palace by the military, she and her companions, Scratch, Terrill Lee, and Sheppard, are kept in protective custody in a penthouse in a nearly abandoned Las Vegas. The story begins when, after sitting on their butts for a month with nothing to do, the Army offers them an opportunity to end their custody. Return to Crystal Palace, retrieve crucial data, and help end the zombie plague. Miller has a bad feeling about the mission, but goes along to protect her friends. It's bad enough to be back in the middle of the Zombie Occupied Zone, but when they see weird religious slogans scrawled on the walls of the top secret base in what seems to be blood, Miller knows that their chances of survival have dropped to near zero. Again. We hope that you will enjoy this story."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1460100-lori", "userReview": "I have the worlds biggest girl crush on Sherrif Penny Miller. I am serious. She is sooo much fun to read. This review will be short and sweet. Why? Because there was nothing I didn't like about this book. Once again Booth and Shannon knocked it out of the park. This book has gore, humor, horror, intrigue, and action. Lots and lots of action. I mean it. Once again we get on the ride in the first chapter and we are still riding it when it ends. This book doesn't have a cliffhanger ending. It's just uncomplete. Penny hasn't gotten her happily ever after. If there is ever a woman that deserves it is Penny. That Cowgirl has worked damned hard for it. I hope that Mr. Booth and Shannon continue write the heck out Penny and these characters. I want to grow old with her. Sigh.

I loved everything about it, especially the sassy, take-no-prisoners heroine, Sheriff Penny Miller. The second book in the series has everything I loved about the first: Penny Miller back in full-on attitude and ass-kicking glory, plenty of zombie action, and a lot of humor. It also has the addition of \"Rat\", another alpha-female character, and seeing Penny try to deal with a woman almost as macho as she is, is great and a welcome change from so many books where it's two alpha-males clashing as their testosterone levels rise. The dialogue and narrative crackle, and the expressions that come out of Penny's mouth are hilarious. Great combination of action, gore, horror and humor. Next in the series, gentlemen!"}, {"userName": "Faye ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5276203-faye", "userReview": "An excellent fast paced sequel to the Hungry, blooming brilliant.

'The Wrath of God', their second offering in the Sheriff Penny Miller series, has done the unthinkable; the sequel is arguably as good, if not better, than their first book 'The Hungry'.Las Vegas has had a mass exodus and the entire state of Nevada has been placed under quarantine. In return for their freedom, Penny and her band of misfits are handed an offer they can't refuse. After a month of protective custody, they've been given a mission to retrieve sensitive data from ground zero which promises a real cure for Penny. The only hitch...in twenty-six hours, the facility will be nuked. Penny, her ex-husband Terrill Lee, ex-biker felon turned almost good guy Scratch, and scientist Karl Sheppard are joined by an elite military team led by Major Francine 'Rat' Hanratty in the race against time. An introduction of a second alpha female turns into a struggle for power between Penny and Rat.'The Wrath of God' continues the story in third person narrative, but there is an added sense of urgency as each chapter begins with a countdown clock. When the clock strikes zero Nevada will go boom, killing everything and everyone that remains. With tension so thick it could be cut with a knife, the building anticipation lurking behind every shadowed corner will leave readers on the edge of their seats. The zombies appear to be getting smarter, displaying the ability to work in concert to strategize and ambush victims.Penny, the main protagonist, is as snarky as ever. While she has finally gotten some new clothes, the tattered wedding gown is anything but forgotten. The sexual tension between Scratch and Penny is building like a pressure cooker, but when a shocking accusation is made, Penny's faith, and trust, is shaken. New conflicts are introduced; bringing with them some creative antagonists. Some are fairly obvious, while others will blind-side readers with their deceit.The authors have crafted Penny to be a well thought out and fully realized character. What makes Penny such a strong lead isn't the super human abilities that allowed her to best a zombie horde, but her strength to endure. In the face of fear and devastating losses she maintains the inner strength to lead and protect others where most would give up. She will stand up to anyone and fight for anything to save herself and those in her charge. Of course the ability to kill a group of zombies with the arm she's torn off of one of them doesn't hurt. Forget the pen, the arm is mightier than the sword.There is a kinship between Joss Whedon's 'Buffy' and Penny Miller. Could Penny be the new Buffy?"}, {"userName": "Thelittlezombiewhocould", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11647503-thelittlezombiewhocould", "userReview": "Well, Harry Shannon and Steven W. Booth did it again. The Hungry 2: The Wrath of God is every bit as awesome as the first novel was! I seriously couldn\u2019t put the book down \u2013 I ended up finishing it in one day. The Hungry 2 is a quick and fun read with outstanding entertainment value!Sheriff Penny Miller is back for more trouble (along with her friends Scratch, Terrill Lee, and Sheppard), and the zombies are just itching for a chance to get their teeth into her flesh!This novel introduces some new characters to mix things up with the returning cast. Major Hanratty and her \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d crew aren\u2019t quite what they seem but, even suspecting that, I was still thrown for a loop when all the twists and turns were revealed. Father Abraham and his flock are almost exactly what I expected, but the way their story is revealed is terrifyingly satisfying!This novel has everything the first novel did, only ratcheted up to the next level: humor, despair, sexual tension (dear God, the sexual tension!!), tragedy, and triumph. From the very first page, the action begins and the pace just doesn\u2019t let up. Even at the very end of the book, the reader is left wanting more, eagerly anticipating what might be next for our little band of misfit heroes!My only question is: When will The Hungry 3: Penny and Scratch Get Their Groove On be available?Do yourself a favor: Buy this series!!

A team of mercenaries will go along to protect them and they, among other things, are to bring info back to the military.Penney has a very bad feeling about this from the start but really isn't given much of a choice. At least she's not wearing a wedding dress in this adventure.Zombies, bad guys, nut cases, and much more fill the pages of this zombie gorefest.I do wish the authors would learn the difference between waiving and waving.
