Mild-mannered number cruncher gets a life, as he tracks down the history of an elusive acquaintance. His search leads him to a small town with loads of secrets, lots of men with muscles and bad tempers, and A Strong Woman. What could have been almost farcical in another\u2019s hands, works out to be a good, quick read in Pronzini\u2019s. Smoothly descriptive, not too much navel-gazing but enough to understand the protagonist, good pacing and a nicely gruesome murder plot to chew upon, makes this quite enjoyable even to someone who doesn\u2019t usually like westerns. And that\u2019s essentially what this is: a coming-of-age western, a High Noon variant that\u2019s rather more pastel than Technicolor, but entertaining just the same."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1006779-karen", "userReview": "Jim Messenger is a CPA living a dull existence in San Francisco, when he notices a woman in the cafe that he frequents. The woman appears to be as lonely and alone as Jim is, so he works up the courage to speak with her after he notices that she comes in the same time every night. He works up the courage to speak with her, but she makes it clear she wants nothing to do with him. Then she stops coming into the cafe, and Jim is worried about her. Jim Messenger's life is no longer dull."}, {"userName": "Harry Shannon", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1172628-harry-shannon", "userReview": "Atmopsheric, tense, touching and for the most part strikingly original.

They would often have a 'theme', such as 'Horror Saturday', 'Audrey Hepburn Saturday', or 'Jack Lemmon Saturday' or 'Mystery Saturday'. The channel would start off with their movie marathons at 10:00 am Saturday morning and finish up on 8:00 pm. All the kids in the neighborhood would look forward to finding out what theme was going to be coming up next weekend, this was years before cable TV, so we were limited in our choices back then. The first movie would always be an older one, 'B' movie from the 1950's, they would then improve in quality as the day wore on, to the 'B' movie from the 1960's, to vaguely remembered movie from the 1970's, to the more recent movie that didn't perform well at the box office, until they would get to the headliner movie at 8:00 pm, which would usually be a movie that had been first released in theaters four or five years ago. Again, this is before cable. Anyway, this book reminded me of those old movies that this channel would show in the middle of a Saturday afternoon on a 'Mystery Weekend'. These wouldn't be bad movies at all, maybe they'd star someone like William Bendix instead of an 'A' list star like Kirk Douglas, but they'd be entertaining and be well made. So this is a solid, entertaining book with a twisty ending that I kind of saw coming, but Pronzini did such a good job of setting the scene with his description of this rural Nevada town that it didn't really matter much that the story is a bit far fetched. The setting and characters are worthwhile enough to hold interest with this one."}, {"userName": "Kathleen Hagen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291703-kathleen-hagen", "userReview": "Blue Lonesome, by Bill Pronzini. B-plus.Cassette book borrowed from Library for the BlindJim Messenger, is a CPA in San Francisco with a very ordinary life. He eats his meals most nights in a particular restaurant. He starts seeing a woman always by herself at another table. She looks so tortured and depressed that he privately starts calling her \u201cblue Lonesome\u201d. He tries to talk to her but she makes it clear to him that she doesn\u2019t want a friend. Then she kills herself. Jim Messenger decides he must track down her family. No one seems to have any knowledge of her, even her real name, and she has left an inheritance which should go to her family. He gets into her room and finds an old library book from \u201cThe Bulahe Public Library.\u201d He figures out that it is a town in Nevada, and he goes there to find out about this woman. He finds out a great deal, is put in danger himself, is disliked by the whole town who didn\u2019t like the woman he came to find out about. He finds that the woman is hated by the town because she is thought to have murdered her little girl and her brother-in-law. Ultimately his life is changed forever by his visit to this town. Pronzini is a good storyteller, and it\u2019s a good blessedly short read."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnston", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30738760-susan-johnston", "userReview": "Although this is the first full length novel of Mr. Pronzini that I have read (having read several shorts stories in anthologies), it will not be the last. The book starts out with Jim Messenger, our protagonist, spying a sad looking woman in the diner where he eats. He names her Ms. Lonesome as he recognizes the abject sadness of someone cut off from others and life. He recognizes it because he sees a kindred spirit.He attempts to befriend her, is shut down and then becomes slightly creepy in his obsession with her from a distance. His obsession blossoms after she commits suicide so much that he needs to find out what happened to her to make her so \"blue lonesome\".In the process, he goes through a transformation that elevates him from an insignificant colourless slug to a strong and passionate hero.The mystery of Ms. Lonesome involves some pretty shady characters who deal in child abuse and incest, murder, religion and other small town shenanigans. While the final resolution of the mystery was unpredicatable and its unveiling carried me along page to page, the actual final outcome of the book was not. I didn't mind though. I was kind of hoping it would end like that.Good book filled with damaged but decent characters and a fast paced story. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4107148-bill", "userReview": "You\u2019ve felt it \u2013 I\u2019ve felt it \u2013 we all have felt that deep loneliness from time to time \u2013 we have felt, well, lonesome blue, and that\u2019s what the woman Jim Messenger notices and then sees every night at the restaurant where he has dinner is feeling deeply.He sit down with her, but she tells him she won\u2019t speak with him, and he leaves.

Thoroughly enjoyed getting wrapped up in the main character's head, all that loneliness and alienation. I'm sure the fact that I am a mid-career accountant like the main character has nothing to do with it. Seems to me the last Pronzini I read, The Crimes of Jordan Wise, which was fantastic, was also about an accountant who makes some big life choices. Years ago I read a Nameless book of Pronzini's and didn't think much of it. But now after two really good ones, I may have to try Nameless again, or whatever other Pronzini I can find."}, {"userName": "Littoface", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2492515-littoface", "userReview": "Have you ever seen someone who looked so lonely that you were compelled to approach them?
