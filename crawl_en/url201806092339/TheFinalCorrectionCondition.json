Am. Speechless.I think I have been the most highly strung 18 year old in the country this month due to my job, and this book has been a haven for me when I need to kick back and think of something else, and my word did this book get me thinking. I guess I\u2019m sort of a low-key conspiracy theorist (no tinfoil I promise!) and so any little detail I get in these books gets my brain racing like crazy! After the huge plot twist that Alec Birri wrote at the very end of The Curing Begins (no spoilers) my mind started making that whirring noise that old computers do. I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself! My skin was crawling with anticipation at what was going to happen next! What could happen next?!Apparently a lot of things could happen next.The Final Correction begins with a father and daughter from Israel embarking on some sort of religion themed quest, and I was a bit stumped as to what year this was set in due to some of the views the father has. The appearance of futuristic technology however made it clear these chapters aren\u2019t set in the past. There\u2019s a huge theme of religion present in a lot of this book, and at the start I was quite confused again (apparently I\u2019m quite good at being confused) with what this had to do with everything else! But once again Alec Birri\u2019s talent at making it all tie together came shining through towards the middle of the book. Dr. M- , ahem, Dr. Savage boldly faces a lot of controversy to do with his \u2018cure\u2019 for seemingly everything and his AI inventions.There are many points where lines were blurred \u2013 reality was blurred! The world created by Alec is given a choice to comply with the new rules or not.The Final Correction goes very in-depth with science fiction and is the sort of book that may need reading/listening to twice to let everything set in (like the Matrix but a little bit more hardcore).Jonathan Keeble\u2019s voice acting skills continue to be beyond impressive, and the many voices he has faced in this book were incredible. His approach to the voices of AI characters were very well done, not seeming too robotic yet being distinct. This book was incredibly intense, and Keeble projected that intensity in every character and line. He\u2019s an outstanding voice actor and is definitely one to look out for.Alec Birri and Jonathan Keeble have once again created audiobook greatness, and I\u2019m glad that I have had the opportunity to review this trilogy.I received this audiobook as part of my participation in a blog tour with Audiobookworm Promotions.

The gifting of this audiobook did not affect my opinion of it."}, {"userName": "Fee (Ebook Addicts)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570361-fee-ebook-addicts", "userReview": "The Story:This final instalment to the Condition Trilogy was, I have to admit confusing at best, but boy did it suck me in. We are met with new\u00a0 characters in the first part of this book Isra and\u00a0Faruk, and at first I wasn't sure what part in time we were in - past, present or future, but as the story unfolds we discover they are very much in the future and Dr Savage and his AI are dominating the world - ok not fully but the AI interaction has stepped up a great deal. Humans are turning to the AI whist some are still clinging to the old ways and that is were the conflict comes into play. Can a world relying heavily on AI really co-exist or will the AI take over? And the red pill to cure not just dementia etc but more \"deviant\" behaviour like paedophilia and homosexuality and murderers? It is all another form of control, that just blew my mind. To think that this may or even actually happen is a scary prospect at best.If you are a lover of Sci Fi and movies like \"I am Legend\" that focus on the AI then this series is definitely for you - this series really gave me food thought and I loved Birri's way of sucking me into the story from book 1 and I couldn't stop until the very end of book 3 when I finally let out a sigh of \"wow\".Sci-Fi is not my normal genre but Birri may have just changed my mind, and I can wait to read more from him.The Narrator:Once again\u00a0Jonathan Keeble has done a brilliant job at narrating this book and I am glad he was there from book 1 and his voice was one that you instantly knew and fitted well with the story.I received this audiobook as part of my participation in a blog tour with Audiobookworm Promotions.

That being said, onward! :)At the top of book 3, we are once again shocked by Birri as he brings us to the third arc of the story. We begin in the year 2028, by following Faruk and his daughter Isra\u2019s journey through the desert in the middle east. With new characters and events unfolding, readers are eager to push forward so that sense can be made from the stunning conclusion at the end of book 2, with the truth of Professor Savage being revealed. However, Birri takes us further down the rabbit hole of corruption, AI interactions with humans, and the mystery surrounding government control alongside scientific advancements from the notorious \u201cred pill.\u201dWith book 3 divided into three pronounced parts, Birri allows us to see each of these story arcs unfold and then brings them together at the very end. In part 1, we see how Faruk brings his daughter to the prince as one of the \u201cchosen ones\u201d for his mysterious cause, that is seemingly related to the trials, the pill, and the Interworld\u2014the \u201cworld\u201d existing between this world and the next.On a quick RECAP: It came into existence through science\u2019s advances to create a computer-generated environment, where disembodied forms of intelligence can reside. These can include the consciousness of humans (if \u201cuploaded\u201d into the Interworld), AI intelligence, and the like). When connected with the Interworld, apparently enabled by use of the red pill, the telepathic connection of \u201cmerging\u201d is possible, where human consciousness and artificial intelligence can become one, of sorts. This piece of the story is nothing short of complex but it closely relates to each of the areas of the story as they progress.In part 2, we return to the story of Professor Savage and his subsequent release from prison, only to go on house arrest. He continues to feud both in views and actions with his arch-nemesis, Alex Saib who is the polar opposite of Savage, as a feminist far-left politician, aiming to eradicate the \u201cevil\u201d that Savage has unleashed within the world with his trials and AI integration into the human population. Part 3 ties all the arcs together, revealing Dan Passen, Dr. Adams, Emil, Maria, Faruk, Isra, Salib, American President Kalten, and Savage\u2019s purpose in the entire saga, ending with the stunning (if it is possible to be further stunned at this point) conclusion and apt progression of the human race! I\u2019ve decided not to reveal the final and most thought-provoking spoiler at the end, so it can be enjoyed by other readers. All I can say is it is worth the wait!Overall, I give this final installation 5 stars as an excellent conclusion to a very enjoyable series! I would recommend this trilogy to readers seeking an intricate, thought-provoking political thriller. It is an intelligent read and requires really taking time to soak in all that Birri puts before us. A fantastic read!"}, {"userName": "Ana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33471531-ana", "userReview": "https://anaslair.wordpress.com/2017/0...I finished this last night and I am still not quite sure what I read.I enjoyed it as the previous ones but I cannot say I understood everything. That Professor Savage character was just too mysterious, I guess I needed it dumbed down more so that I could fully grasp what the author was trying to say. It's not that there was that much scientific mumbo-jumbo to sift through, I just felt a lot of important information lacked in favour of suspense.Overall I enjoyed the trilogy. I particularly loved the two first books' prologues and how, when I finished each book, I would see them in a completely different light. It is food for thought, if nothing else.Disclaimer: I would like to thank the publisher and Netgalley for providing me a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Nicole Sweeney", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34184993-nicole-sweeney", "userReview": "Review originally posted on The Bibliophile ChroniclesThe Final Correction is the third book in the Condition series, ending a trilogy of mysterious medical thrillers. I really loved the premise, the idea that brain disorders were treatable. But it\u2019s so much more than just treating brain disorders, those with thoughts that are not what society wants them to be \u2013 murderers, those with extreme views, their \u2018brain disorders\u2019 can also be treated. I think with the advancement of technology and how rapidly medicine is advancing this is quite a realistic premise, and as a result that made the book even more enjoyable because it felt infinitely possible.As stated this is the third book in the series. I haven\u2019t personally read the other two books, and this one can be read as a stand alone. After having read the book I do feel like I\u2019d like to go back and read books one and two, because although I enjoyed the story I felt there were some things I had missed out on in the first parts of the series.The one thing about this book is that it constantly surprised me. Just when I thought I knew where things were headed, they twisted off in another direction. It\u2019s a really enjoyable story, and the more you read the more intrigued you get \u2013 as the reader you definitely want to know more. The book is well written and paced excellently, giving the reader time to comprehend the multi-layered plot that is going on. Although there aren\u2019t too many characters, they are very well portrayed, showing plenty of depth and emotion.After finishing the book I went to do a little research before I wrote my blog post and was stunned to find that this series is actually based on the authors own experience in command of a top secret government organisation. For me this made the book all the more frightening and realistic. If that doesn\u2019t give you food for thought, I don\u2019t know what will!"}, {"userName": "Kristine Hall", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6111861-kristine-hall", "userReview": "Audio Book Review. Artificial intelligence, the Interworld, telepathy, robots, virtual reality, and evolution -- for the serious sci-fi fan, Condition Book Three: The Final Correction, the third book of the dystopian trilogy by Alec Birri, THIS is your series (and you must start with book one).As with the prior two books, The Final Correction wastes no time immersing readers into this not so distant world. Birri begins the book by telling one of Aesop\u2019s fables, about the north wind and the sun, which focuses on man\u2019s overconfidence and belief he is in control when he ultimately is not. That is the crux of the story, and the theme is good to keep in mind as readers make their way through this complex story.A new setting and group of characters dominate part one of the book. Initially, it is difficult to tell whether it is past, present, or future. There\u2019s an Islamic father and daughter making a trek (pilgrimage?) and their rituals and attitudes could place them a hundred years back. Soon, technologies begin to emerge, and it\u2019s clear that we are in the world changed by Dr. Savage and sentient robots are the norm. However, some humans are clinging to the old ways and are resistant to the changes away from traditional teachings. As part one moves along, familiar characters are re-introduced and this seemingly new story line begins to get woven into the story lines set-up in the earlier books in the trilogy. From the Middle East, readers transition into the western world and are reminded of how this world is defined. People with brain disorders can receive \u201cthe treatment\u201d to cure any brain ailment. Not just medical problems like autism and dementia are now curable; also, the deviant behaviors of pedophiles and murderers can and are being corrected. As the medical and scientific advances and their applications seem to move humanity into a better world, the lines become blurred when leaders and powerful players differ in how they are defining deviant behaviors and \u201cthe treatment\u201d is being taken too far.Naturally, there are warring factions and people resistant to removing the humanity from humans. With the ability to have a hybrid existence of time in the real world and time in the virtual world, again, the lines are blurred as to where one ends and the other begins \u2013 or whether a real world exists at all for some. There are some deep, mind blowing concepts happening in this series, and especially in this final installment of the trilogy. Birri has some excellent descriptions and depictions that will haunt readers long after the final words are read. The author also does a great job in making readers feel conflicted about their feelings for the various characters as each is more fully developed. Readers will love some of the big reveals, and there are satisfying twists and turns-of-events. Happily, there is some humor sprinkled about, and I got a real chuckle (of course) when a character spoke a clunker, and the doctor responded with \"Maybe it was the Grammar Nazis I wanted to take over the world. Not the jack-booted ones.\" Admittedly, I had some trouble with the last third of the book as it went heavily into the science fiction realm. I couldn\u2019t keep all the sub-plots straight and at times had absolutely no idea what was happening. As much as I LOVE the narration by Jonathan Keeble, The Final Correction got too complicated for me to comprehend by reading with my ears. I need to get this series in print so that I can easily flip back and re-read and let things soak in. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think I could honestly say how the book ended. Heaven, Hell, end of times, or a new beginning? Not sure. I think it was open-ended enough that there could be more stories to tell, so perhaps there will be another series. (Or perhaps not since it\u2019s quite possible that I missed something huge in the chaos.)A few words about the narration and narrator, Jonathan Keeble: Seriously \u2013 seek out anything voiced by this guy; he is amazing. I have nothing but the highest praise for how he handles this huge, international cast of characters. You can read my gushing about him in the prior book reviews. Top notch.Thank you to the author and Audiobookworm Promotions for providing me an audio download in exchange for my honest opinion.

The world has changed thanks to the scientific innovations brought about by Professor Savage and the traditional Faruk has a good deal of trouble blending his old ways with the new face of Islam. Isra, on the other hand, is finding a lot of freedom she never knew before as a young Muslim woman. This particular section of the story is very relevant today as we try, not always successfully, to accept and accommodate cultures and religions that vary widely.Later, we re-encounter Professor Savage, Nurse Tracy and Dr. Addams as well as a host of new characters; in fact, I began to wish for a cast of characters, not that such a thing is very helpful with an audiobook. What began as an attempt to treat---or, rather, correct---brain disorders has morphed into a mishmash of real time and virtual reality as well as an evolution in the abilities of AI's to have the emotions of humans. Unfortunately, the question of who is to decide what is aberrant or deviant behavior in need of \"correction\" is a very heavy issue, as heavy as that of the anti-terror activities that may lead to a new world war.There is no tidy end to this trilogy but much is left to the reader's own thoughts, not a bad way to conclude such a tale.Jonathan Keeble has grown into one of my favorite narrators with his pleasant tones, vivid characterizations (including what seem to be accurate accents in a variety of cultures) and his ability to evoke all kinds of feelings about the story. I don't think Mr. Birri could have asked for a better voice for his tale."}, {"userName": "Elena Alvarez Dosil", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2113437-elena-alvarez-dosil", "userReview": "Although I found the first book in the series really intriguing, I started to lose interest with the second, finding it too confusing at times. With this one I was unable to relate at all. I think the fact that the second didn't move me should have been a signal about the third. It grew more confusing, I couldn't connect to the characters, and I didn't care about anything. Birri had finally lost me.I think the story had great potential but Birri's storytelling skills need some more polishing.
