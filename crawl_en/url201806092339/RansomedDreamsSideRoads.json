She felt she had lost everything - her husband, her career, her peace of mind, and nearly all contact with the outside world - in a matter of mere minutes. Choosing to retreat to a remote Mexican village to escape the trauma of the incident and to care for her disabled husband, she thought she had put distance between herself and her worst fears. But when her father's failing health and her sister's plea to return home forces her to leave her safety zone and her dependent husband, the realities of her strained family relationships, the disappointments of her marriage, discoveries about her parents' pasts, and the feelings she has developed for her savior Luke Traynor are just some of the realities she must face before she can find herself again. For anyone who thinks that fiction is simply an indulgence to escape reality, this book will be a huge surprise. The story will resonate with anyone who has ever found himself in the midst of unexpected and disappointing life circumstances and asked, \"How did I get here, and how can I escape?\" As a person whose life has taken dramatic turns in the area of my health, I empathized with the struggles of both Sheridan's character, who feels forced to swallow the bitter pill of a life lost, and that of her husband Eliot, who is trapped by his body and paralyzed with fear that he will end up alone. But not until they reach the end of themselves and turn back to God, do they find peace to reconcile damaged relationships and rediscover their love for each other. The story is dramatic and action-packed, but it is also full of life-changing truths. This is surely one work of fiction that will be worth your time!"}, {"userName": "Michelle Rayburn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3843107-michelle-rayburn", "userReview": "Sheridan Montgomery had been living her dream as the wife of an ambassador and the director of a program to help underprivileged women. Until a vicious attack changed everything. As she cared for her disabled husband, she watched her dreams slip away. In \u201cRansomed Dreams,\u201d Sally John creates a story that touches readers. With the right balance of mystery, action, and emotion, she knows how to draw a reader in. At the heart of the story is the dream that Sheridan Montgomery gave up to care for her husband and hide in Mexico for protection. She\u2019s restless and disappointed and struggling with how she feels about this loss. She\u2019s desperate for happiness but unsure how to find it. In a society where \u201cfor better or worse\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much, this book provides a refreshing example of a couple who works through some tough issues. From the exhaustion of a caregiver to the depression of a disabled spouse, to the temptation to leave with someone who meets emotional needs not met in the marriage, and the lack of support from family, Sally John has addressed real problems in a real way. That\u2019s what makes this great fiction. It isn\u2019t about a perfect couple with a fairytale relationship. She shows the reader through the good days and bad days in a marriage that\u2019s in the \u201csickness\u201d and the \u201cworse\u201d phase of the vows, the marriage that hasn\u2019t seen \u201chealth\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d in a long time.\u201cRansomed Dreams\u201d is for anyone who has ever wanted to walk away from a difficult marriage, who has ever felt hopeless, or who has lost a dream. It\u2019s an inspiring story of faith and emotional healing.(Note: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my fair and honest review.)"}, {"userName": "Casey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3194216-casey", "userReview": "One shot shattered more than just bodies, it decimated lives and realities, crushing innocent illusions.The story behind this novel was intriguing, and it interested me. The prologue gripped me, the drama intense and the emotions high, planting many question in my mind. But the novel really didn\u2019t interest me until I was about 150 pages into it. As the drama was kicked up a notch and the emotions flowing, the story kept me interested. Two plot lines on different paths, but managing to intersect and wasn\u2019t confusing in the process. I liked the setting, Mexico, and it was refreshing not to wade through much of the language of that region, you got the flavor without the Spanish.But I struggled to enjoy this novel to its full potential, and I have a hard time saying why. I think it was because much of the novel, I was being filled in, instead of experiencing what was going on. It felt more distanced and at times it was too much to want to wade through.This novel wasn\u2019t my favorite, but the story beneath the \u201ctelling\u201d was unique and the ending satisfying.Thanks to Tyndale Publishers for my copy to review."}, {"userName": "Shirley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1906542-shirley", "userReview": "The book was very slow moving and kind of boring.

Sheridan, who felt a calling to community service, helping impoverished women escape life on the streets by teaching them skills and a trade, is now nursemaid to a husband who no longer shares her bed. There is no phone, no Internet - nothing to connect them to the outside world, which is what they agreed on over a year ago when they decided to move there.When not caring for Eliot, who has suffered permanent nerve damage, Sheridan mopes around by herself, thinking things like, \"This is NOT what I signed up for,\" and generally feeling sorry for herself. One morning, as she is sitting on her patio, she sees Luke Traynor, the man who saved her life and stuck with her and with Eliot through the lengthy hospital stay after the attack, walking up the hill to her house. He brings a message from her sister, Lissa. Their father, a long-term U.S. congressman, has suffered a debilitating stroke and is not expected to live. Could she return stateside to visit and to help Lissa?Sheridan does NOT want to go, but she is persuaded to do so. There are secrets that Lissa has found out that she needs to tell her - secrets that changed Lissa's perception of their father and that caused the confrontation that led to his attack.I wanted to like this book. The cover is awesome and the premise is an interesting one. This book is supposed to be about faith, and how our faith can be tested by extreme circumstances. BUT, Sheridan, who is supposed to be the one with faith, never really demonstrates it. She goes through the motions of it, but she is a whiner. She has snits for no apparent reason. She dislikes her sister, again for no apparent reason other than that when their mother died, Lissa left college to come home and take care of her at 13 years old. She dislikes her father, who we find out later WAS a pretty bad guy, but her dislike is really undefined for most of this book. Sheridan, in short, is a character that I really didn't like. I don't like whiners ... I don't care for people who have this, \"Woe is me; life is so unfair\" attitude, especially when things could be so much worse.Eliot starts coming into his own a bit once Sheridan leaves and the village padre convinces him to get out and about a bit. I liked Eliot. Even with all that he's gone through, he has an intense love for his wife and, once he's figured out that he CAN do some things, he's a pretty good guy; however, he has a secret as well - one that may be uncovered with the death of the congressman.Sheridan must battle through her new fear of crowds and crowded places, her attraction to another man, her dislike of her sister, and her hatred of her father. She learns interesting facts about her father, her mother, and her husband that change her perception of her place in the world.This book is OK - just that, though .. OK. I feel that it never delves deep enough into the characters and what really makes them tick. Even the faith that it is supposed to show seems to be surface faith, not true blue, deep in your heart faith. I started to get into the book in the last 15-20 pages, but I had to go through 350 or more pages to get there.Quotes:Welcome to my world, Luke.

It's not really a romance but a book featuring a middle aged married couple facing struggles physically and emotionally that are taking a toll on their marriage. I'm not married or in a relationship right now but I do realize that in any kind of relationship, even friendships, there are going to be rough spots so I thought this would be a good story to read for a change of pace. Ransomed Dreams is the first novel I've ever read by Sally John, and even though it does focus on an older couple, not 20somethings like a lot of Christian fiction, I liked it. Sheridan and Eliot Montgomery are faced with a trial that I can't ever imagine dealing with in their lives as U.S. foreign diplomats in Venezuela. The author presented it in such a way that I was caught up from the first page, however as the story continued the writing seemed to get a bit choppy, it just didn't all flow together for me from chapter to chapter. I did like the characters though and felt sympathetic towards Sheridan who had to not only deal with Eliot's disability and their strained relationship but issues with her sister and father as well. She was real. She thought about another man, she wondered about whether her husband would ever return to his old self, and she had bitterness towards her father. Sheridan was far from the perfect heroine that I'm so used to reading about which was a very refreshing change. I look forward to reading the next book in the Side Roads series to see if we get another glimpse at this family or some of the secondary characters like Luke and Mercedes. ***Special thanks to Vicky Lynch of Tyndale House Publishers, Inc for sending me a review copy.***"}, {"userName": "Pamela (Lavish Bookshelf)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2996699-pamela-lavish-bookshelf", "userReview": "\u201cAt precisely twelve minutes, thirty-five seconds past ten o\u2019clock in the morning Venezuelan time, Sheridan Montgomery\u2019s world ceased to exist.\u201d Probably the best opening sentence I have read in years, it\u2019s the opening sentence of the newest novel by Sally John titled Ransomed Dreams. Sally John has spun an exciting and intriguing tale that leads readers through the high-stakes world of international diplomats into the deep nitty-gritty emotions of family loyalties and secrets. \u201cRansomed Dreams\u201d is as much about espionage as it is about the relationships with those who know you best. By approaching it all with a heart for God\u2019s will, John has written a fabulous book that will have you racing to the end to see what happens, yet not wanting the book to end. The main character of the book, Sheridan Montgomery, has a powerful story reflected in the fantastic opening sentence. As a diplomat\u2019s wife Sheridan\u2019s life is interesting and very unique, but at the same time it\u2019s very real for any modern Christian woman as Sheridan confronts her feelings about her marriage, her goals for her life and her identity as a sister and daughter. Sally John has created in Sheridan a true voice for how a modern Christian woman should behave. Sheridan is extremely genuine in her struggles with God\u2019s will for her life versus what the world would say Sheridan deserves.

The story switched between the current story of overcoming fears and forgiving others and the story of the events leading up to the assassination attempt. They do connect together in important ways, and I thought it was handled well.The world-building was very good. The tension in the story was created by the strain in the various relationships, and it had a slightly slower pacing. The characters were complex and dealt with realistic struggles. However, I never really bonded to the main characters because they weren't very likable, especially at the beginning. I was more interested in some of the secondary characters.Sheridan and her husband were Catholics with an on-again-off-again relationship with God. The characters seemed to view God as real and active but...distant?...useful to ask help from, but usually irrelevant though nice to talk about? Well, something. Sheri would usually go sit in a (usually empty) church when she wanted to \"connect\" with God, and she found her greatest comfort in the familiar motions of taking the Eucharist. Since family and friends (including a priest) loved to give each other snippets of advice on handling fears and relationship troubles, some readers might view this novel as \"preachy\" (though it's good advice). I thought it was fine since the characters' acted like real people do in such situations.The minor amount of bad language was in the \"he cussed\" style. There was no sex.

A year after the shooting, Luke Traynor arrives at their home to announce that Sheridan has been summoned home to Chicago by her sister Calissa because their father is dying. Luke cared for Sheridan in the days and weeks after the attack until she came to depend on him too much and asked him to never come back. John has rendered a world in which a life can be completely changed in a single moment and forces the reader to consider how their own life would survive. Sheridan, Eliot, and Calissa also seem to live with sunburned emotions; even the slightest touch causes flinching and pain. There's also a story of terrible family secrets, the lies we tell to conceal them, and how we move forward from our parents' history.

You can't help but sympathize with her situation and I think the author handled her frustrations and marital stress well. Her relationship with Luke was well done too, the temptation to cross the line into adultery and the struggle not to give in to it. All marriages go through rough patches, Sheridan's aittle more than most, so it was easy to relate and I was happy to see her and her husband ultimately star closer to God and each other as a result of their experience."}, {"userName": "Margie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3819529-margie", "userReview": "I am ( was ) a huge Sally John fan. This one really disappointed me. It began very s-l-o-w and never picked up the pace. There were some interesting twists in it, but it took them a long time to be revealed. It was kind of a depressing book. There are three in the series. I am going attempt number two and three, with the hopes of better results. If you have the opportunity, please pick up one of Sally John's other books. They were amazing."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/691797-robin", "userReview": "When I started the book, I didn't know that it was a Christian book. The religious messages at times got to be too much for me. If they were take out all together, something would have been lost so I wouldn't say that they should be there, heads up would have be nice.I don't always think about a book's title but I did for this one. It just doesn't fit for me. I don't have an alternative title to suggest."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4429368-susan", "userReview": "Sally John was a new author for me. She was a delight to read and I plan to read more of her works. I enjoyed the faith journey of the wife, the husband and the sister in this book. The support characters were well developed and delightful as well. It was easy to picture the tale as it unfolded in my mind's eye. The suspense was just enough to keep the story lively."}, {"userName": "M.M.

It started off with great potential but for me it seemed to drag a bit to long and I had a hard time understanding the climax of the story. With that said, the book wasn't totally horrible. The plot was creative and the message of love and marriage through lifes trials is a worthy read."}, {"userName": "Emorgan05", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7542274-emorgan05", "userReview": "I liked this story. It was an easy read, the characters were interesting, it's got a good plotline. But it was just lacking a little something. Like the author could have done more and just didn't. It was an enjoyable read, but not one that I emphatically recommend."}], "description": "Sheridan Montgomery leads a charmed life as the wife of Eliot, U.S. ambassador to Venezuela.
