All of the books have been set in and around Glacier National Park in the northwest corner of Montana, and to my mind, this one is her best yet.The book opens in Florida with a tragedy that would forever scar the life of Reeve Landon, who is one of the two main protagonists in the novel. Reeve ultimately winds up in Montana, working in the wilderness with his chocolate lab, McKay, for the University of Montana\u2019s detection-canine research program. Essentially, McKay sniffs out the scat of bears and other wild creatures. Reeve then bags it up, labels it, and sends it to be analyzed by researchers who will extract the animals\u2019 DNA and thus expand their knowledge of the wildlife living in the area.Reeve lives alone with McKay in an isolated cabin and prefers the company of his dog to most people. The exception is his young daughter, Emily, who lives most of the time with her mother in Kalispell, a few miles away. Reeve and Emily\u2019s mother were together only briefly, but they both love the little girl and share custody.Out in the woods, Reeve and McKay almost always work alone, which is exactly what Reeve prefers. But late one fall, Reeve\u2019s boss persuades him to allow a journalist named Anne Marie Johnson to accompany him and McKay. Anne Marie is writing an article for a magazine on the university\u2019s detection-canine research program, and Reeve\u2019s boss convinces him that the publicity would be good for the program. Anne Marie spends a long day with Reeve and McKay, working through very difficult, mountainous terrain. Hours later, she turns up shot to death. Reeve was the last person to be seen with her and the local police bring him in for questioning. It\u2019s apparent early on that they have convinced themselves that Reeve is guilty of Anne Marie\u2019s murder.Enter FBI agent Ali Paige, who claims an interest in the case because the murder happened close to Glacier National Park, which would have put the case in the FBI\u2019s jurisdiction. More to the point, although most people don\u2019t know it, she is Reeve Landon\u2019s former girlfriend and the mother of his daughter. Like Reeve, Ali had a troubled past. She believes that Reeve could not be guilty of murder and, naturally, she does not want Emily to lose her father and to be branded as the daughter of a killer. In consequence, Ali begins working the case, even though she has no real jurisdiction and no authorization, and even though doing so could have grave consequences for her career.Carbo excels at creating a sense of place. As these characters make their way along, the reader feels as though he or she is moving side by side along with them in this rugged, beautiful, and often treacherous environment. The scenes with Reeve out in the wilderness are alone worth the price of the book and will resonate especially with anyone who has been lucky enough to visit this part of the country.The author is also very good at writing damaged characters, and both Reeve and Ali are expertly drawn. The story is told in alternating chapters first from one point of view and then the other, and by the time the book is over the reader knows these characters intimately. The story moves briskly and becomes increasingly gripping, so that by the end of the novel, the tension has built to a fever pitch and it\u2019s virtually impossible to put it down. Readers who haven\u2019t yet discovered this series are in for a treat, and A Sharp Solitude would be an excellent place to start. 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Cindy Burnett", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445617-cindy-burnett", "userReview": "This is the first book that I have read in this series, and I enjoyed it. The book appealed to me because we frequent national parks when we vacation. The plot was interesting, and the resolution a bit of a pleasant surprise. I was not a huge fan of Ali\u2019s old boyfriend (and father of her child), but that did not ruin the book for me.I love CJ Box\u2019s Joe Pickett series in which Box incorporates issues related to Joe\u2019s job as a game warden. I was hoping this series was going to be similar; however, Carbo\u2019s book focuses more on the characters and their lives and less on Glacier National Park and issues arising there. Previous books may incorporate the setting more; that certainly would be a big selling point for me in future installments. I received this book to read and review; all opinions are my own."}, {"userName": "Sharon Mensing", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3704807-sharon-mensing", "userReview": "The dangers of the wilderness play a role in this novel, but they don't take center stage. Instead, the book focuses on two damaged transplants to Montana, FBI agent Ali Page and the father of her child, Reeve Landon. Both are reclusive, sharing their personal lives with no one and having found their solitude impossible to share even with each other. Thus, when Reeve ends up as a suspect in a murder case, he is less than forthcoming with the police, eventually disappearing into the vast unpopulated forest. For her part, Ali, believing in Reeve's innocence, becomes a rogue investigator including no one in her inquiries until it's almost too late.This book is something of a departure for Carbo\u2019s series, in that it strays away from Glacier National Park and from a focus on the outdoors that has the wilderness almost playing the role of a character in her previous books. Here, the focus is on the psychology of the characters. Ali grew up in a dysfunctional family, and Reeve accidentally shot his best friend when he was nine years old. Both of them deal with resultant doubts in their professional and personal lives, and their interactions with others are colored by these early experiences. The book progresses through alternating chapters told from Ali\u2019s and Reeve\u2019s perspectives, and from the past and present, and this keeps the reader engaged and anxious to follow the plot lines as they converge.In keeping with the nature of a psychological mystery, even the secondary characters are well developed. In the end, Carbo provides the reader with a twist while not letting either Ali nor Reeve escape the consequences of their actions. The last quarter of the book is un-put-downable.Thank you to netgalley for providing this book for review."}, {"userName": "Mark Stevens", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2410049-mark-stevens", "userReview": "Ali Paige and Reeve Landon have one key thing in common.\u201cWe both seemed to be followed by a certain darkness like a stray dog you can\u2019t convince to go away. It was as if we were always reminding each other that people never completely rid themselves of lonesomeness even in the company of a partner,\u201d Ali tells us in A Sharp Solitude, the fourth entry in Christine Carbo\u2019s Glacier Mystery Series.Both Ali and Reeve, in fact, are haunted by that \u201ccertain darkness\u201d and that is among the reasons they are no longer together.Ali is an FBI investigator. Reeve, father of Ali\u2019s child, works for the University of Montana\u2019s detection-canine program. He\u2019s most comfortable in the woods, alone, doing conservation and biological research. Reeve, we learn immediately, accidentally shot a friend when he was nine years old. Ali\u2019s \u201ccertain darkness\u201d is less tied to a specific moment in time and more from being witness to general family dysfunction and a violent father when she was young.Reeve and Ali\u2019s relationship is amicable, but no longer romantic. They are alone together. Their orbits rarely cross except to manage logistics around visits with the daughter, Emily.But after reporter Anne Marie Johnson turns up dead outside a cabin she\u2019s borrowing and since her murder follows a day that she spent with Reeve, watching him work with his energetic dog McKay, Reeve is quickly arrested. His only alibi is a furry chocolate lab. So who is he going to call?Ali is keenly aware of the nature of Reeve\u2019s \u201ccertain darkness\u201d but she also knows he\u2019s no killer\u2014no matter the circumstantial evidence that points one big finger of guilt at her ex. As a seasoned FBI investigator, Ali also knows that her previous entanglement with Reeve means an obvious conflict of interest and she knows she needs to keep her mitts off the case. Very few people in Ali\u2019s circles are even aware that Reeve is Emily\u2019s father.But Ali also knows the power of false accusations and, well, she can\u2019t help herself. And if she just helps out a little, tries to steer things the right way and ask a few gentle questions, what\u2019s the harm? This tension between Ali\u2019s natural investigative instincts and her yearning need to \u201chelp\u201d lend this novel a special flavor, especially after her status is exposed.A Sharp Solitude is the latest in Carbo\u2019s character-driven series and, as with the previous three, she has a new character on center stage. Ali Paige was a minor character in No. 3, The Weight of Night, while Gretchen Larson and Monty Harris (the stars of No. 3) are relegated to brief cameos here (and readers of the full series enjoy a smile when they appear).Yes, character-driven. But do not for a second take that as code for \u201cslow.\u201d Thoughtful? Yes. Rich? Yes. Slow? Hardly.Carbo flashes through quick, punchy chapters with a neat structure\u2014alternating first-person points of view that stagger back and forth in time. We start in the present, a Thursday, with Ali and then go to \u201cThe Day Before\u201d with Reeve. Back and forth we go until Reeve catches up to Thursday and then we get another glimpse of Wednesday and Ali lurches ahead to Friday and finally Reeve catches up as well. Carbo plays absolutely fair with the reader\u2014you never feel cheated and over-manipulated (in fact, not at all). It\u2019s quite the plotting feat and gives A Sharp Solitude a feeling of looming dread. The whole book takes place in a week.Like the others before it, A Sharp Solitude is always about much more than the surface issues. The surface is a starting point. The investigation is nifty, the clues are fresh, and the final solution plays right to key themes of solitude, loneliness, and self-awareness (a common denominator for all of Carbo\u2019s troubled characters).Reeve and Ali are distinct humans with their own, specific woes. But each draws strength from the great outdoors. \u201cI can feel the timelessness out here,\u201d thinks Reeve, \u201cthe sense of eternity mocking me, pointing out my futile efforts to move through it each day, all day, to gather DNA, to survive myself. It\u2019s a terrible feeling, as if the massive, unforgiving wild is snickering at my uselessness.\u201d Even in the wild, when you can climb up to a high peak and see for hundreds of miles, it\u2019s possible to overlook something right at your feet.A Sharp Solitude is another stellar entry in a series rich with layers and an ever-expanding ensemble of memorable characters. Given the vast landscape and the endless variety of troubled individuals to write about, we can only hope that Christine Carbo has a long, long way to go with this compelling series.++By the way, an interview with Christine on my blog:https://markhstevens.wordpress.com/20..."}, {"userName": "Jamie Canaves", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27454238-jamie-canaves", "userReview": "FBI investigator Ali Paige knows better than to investigate a case not assigned to her\u2013especially, since the suspect is Landon, her daughter\u2019s father. And yet, she can\u2019t stop herself. She\u2019s quickly lying to her partner and doing seriously questionable things in order to prove the investigation is focusing on the wrong person. Told in alternating POV between Ali and Landon, you get to watch Ali try to prove his innocence while slowly watching Landon\u2019s life up until the photographer he was accused of murdering is killed.

When a journalist is found murdered near Glacier Park, detectives naturally look at all the people she spent time with there. When FBI agent Ali Paige discovers the father of her daughter is being questioned as the possible last person to see the journalist alive, she \"checks out\" the investigation to see if he or someone else will be charged without telling anyone of her connection. When Reeve Landon, her daughter's father, is brought in for questioning, he gets angry with the detectives attitude towards him, and does not give the whole story. The bulk of the book is of the two of them digging their holes deeper and deeper (and why) which I found extremely annoying. Both knew better but once they headed down that road, there was no turning back. Will Ali find the real killer before she loses her career, and Reeve his freedom? Will Reeve head into the wilderness for Canada or face the music? Who did kill the journalist and why. A good mystery viewed from the minds of the two main characters. What I found as annoying will just add to the suspense for other readers. So much exposition of the characters' mindset, even though it added depth to the characters and events, still slowed the story down in places.

With all these complications, Ali has to tread lightly while she investigates on her own, thinking all the while of her daughter, who is close to her father.

The natural beauty of the park and the often terrifying threats of the wilderness are always crucial elements in the novels. The park itself is more than setting; it is character as well.Carbo's tendency to take a minor character from one novel and give him or her a lead in the next novel is much the same as in Tana French's novels. This penchant of developing secondary characters contributes a freshness and energy to each succeeding plot. A Sharp Solitude features FBI investigator Ali Paige and Reeve Landon. Landon is Ali's former boyfriend and the father of her daughter. When Anne Marie Johnson (a journalist who was last seen accompanying Reeve Landon and his service dog for an article she was writing) is murdered, Landon becomes the chief suspect. Intensely private and with a secret past he is desperate to keep hidden, Landon is arrested after not admitting that Anne Marie visited his cabin.Ali Paige refuses to believe Landon is guilty and gets involved in the investigation using her FBI position to get information. But Ali is not authorized to do so and is jeopardizing her own career. She is also afraid she may discover something she doesn't want to know.I thought I knew where the novel was going because issues concerning gun control appear early, but while that is an interesting aspect, the truth is something different.Shifting between Reeve Landon and Ali's perspectives, the reader learns of the events in their pasts that contribute to the situation in which they find themselves.Monte Harris and Gretchen Larsen have only cameo appearances.

I read it in two settings, stopping only to snack and sleep. It's that good! A Sharp Solitude is the 4th in her Glacier Mystery series set in and around Glacier National Park in northwest Montana. Some favorite characters from previous novels make appearances in this one, but, as usual in this series, each novel focuses on a different character.The focus of A Sharp Solitude is Ali Paige, the F.B.I. agent who appears as a supporting character in The Weight of Night. Ali peaked my interest in Weight of Night because she was a strong, no nonsense, somewhat abrasive presence who, I felt, would surely make a great main character. She does!Ali lives, works and raises her daughter Emily in the town of Kalispell. Her former romantic partner Reeve, Emily's father, lives with his dog McKay in a cabin in the nearby Flathead National Forest. Reeve has a tragic past and prefers living in solitude and working for the canine scat detection research program at the University of Montana (by the way, if you think nobody could make the collection of wild animal scat an interesting topic you are in for a big surprise). Both Ali and Reeve are loners by choice but are united in their love for Emily.Reeve becomes the prime suspect in the death of a journalist who spent some time with him for a story and Ali, although not officially part of the investigative team, can't help but become involved.Carbo writes beautifully and plots tightly. She has the ability to craft real characters and real settings. Her mysteries are complex and layered but not slow-moving at all. Reading one of her books leaves me satisfied at the solution of the crime, but also leaves me with a deeper understanding of her characters.I've read all of the Glacier mysteries and they get better and better. Christine Carbo should be winning Edgars and Anthonys and be on best seller lists. And does anyone know someone at Netflix?
