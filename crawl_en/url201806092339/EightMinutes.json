But I never expected that I would devour this book in hours! I was grabbed into this fascinating story from the very beginning.I loved this book with its paranormal theme which is a favorite genre that I like to read. But this was a very original story, none of which I remember having come across before. The author doesn't rush the story but gives a steady pace to the storyline. The characters were all well developed and likable with the exception of the husband, Eric, who made me angry at times. Yet, you will also be concerned at the struggle that Shelly and Eric go through in their marriage and hope for the family to stay together. The author did an excellent job with all the characters even the ones who had minor roles.This book starts as a drama with Shelly in labor, waiting for her husband to arrive at the hospital to be with her. I don't want to give any spoilers or repeat the description of the book but I will say that the author gives a well written tale of a sweet little boy, Toby, who has an imaginary friend. Some of the stories about John, the imaginary friend gave me chills. You will find a bit of a mystery, suspense, humor and the paranormal in this novel. It is a very memorable book that truly makes you think about reincarnation and what does happen after death. I definitely look forward to more books from this author. This is her debut novel and it is a really incredible one. I would highly recommend this wonderful book to everyone!* I received an ARC from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25917729-julie", "userReview": "Posted to Julie Reads a BookI received a free \u201ccopy\u201d through NetGalley.On the night that Shelly Buckner finally became a mother, she very nearly became a widow.

Those eight minutes changed everything Shelly thought was possible.Eight Minutes follows 3 main characters \u2013 Shelly, her husband, Eric, and her son, Toby. The book starts off with what happened the night Shelly gave birth, and then quickly jumps to 3 years later when Toby begins to talk about a man named John Robberson. Neither Shelly nor Eric know who this man is, and Toby seems to know so many details about this man. After a playdate, Shelly begins to think that Toby might be the reincarnation of this man. Eric, of course, does not believe her. While this book addresses the tension between Shelly and Eric, it is mostly about how Shelly deals with Toby\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d. Toby is distraught about John, often having tantrums about things that he tells him.There are a couple of twists that make this book interesting. I curious Lori Reisenbichler was going to bring everything together. The last couple of chapters of this book made me ask, \u201cWhat just happened?!\u201d I was confused because the book had been moving at a decent pace and then all of sudden\u2026WHAM! Everything happened too quickly in the end. I give this book 3 stars because I thought the story was interesting enough to keep me reading, the characters were alright (though Eric\u2019s disrespect to his wife\u2019s concerns made me strongly dislike him.

For 8 minutes, he was dead, before he was revived and rescued by the rescue team.Three years have passed since that near fatal accident and the joyous birth of their son, Toby. Eric and Shelly have gone through and survived some difficult times, as he went through the process of recovering from his horrific experience. They have managed to put away their ordeal, apart from the changes that have come about in Eric. His accident has changed him in some ways. While Shelly understands that such a horrific experience can change anybody, she still misses the sensitive husband of hers who was emotionally present for her whenever she needed him.She misses him most when Toby suddenly brings home an imaginary friend, John Robberson. According to Toby, John is a Fighter pilot and all of Toby\u2019s games suddenly change to violent plane crashes which end with a broken leg. Shelly is initially alarmed that a grown man seems to have befriended Toby, while Eric was looking after him. However as Toby reveals more details about John, Shelly\u2019s fears escalate. She turns to Eric and she finds that Eric is dismissive of her worries. \u2018The old Eric would have never done that\u2019 is Shelly\u2019s first thought.Toby, in the meanwhile starts showing personality changes, which has Shelly completely worried. As she struggles to understand what her son is going through, she and Eric grow further apart. Shelly doesn\u2019t understand what exactly is happening, but instinctively knows that John Robberson needs to go from their lives for things to go back to normal. I wish I could tell you more, but you are going to have to read it to find out what happens next, but I can assure you that it is a nail-biting read. I had an inkling of what was coming, but the way it ended \u2013 I loved that.I really liked the characters, believable and real. I liked the premise of the story. It was well thought out. Shelly\u2019s desperation comes through so well, and her motivation. As well as her loneliness, the loneliness of being in a situation where the person closest to you is the farthest from you, emotionally. And even worse, when you know that the true nature of that person is so different. Shelly\u2019s state of mind is beautifully explored.I also liked the way the book explored other belief systems, the way some beliefs are accepted in such a different way in different cultures.

EIGHT MINUTES  by Lori Reisenbichler  is a haunting debut, a tale of one two families drawn together by higher forces for an intriguing twist of paranormal. A happy normal family, Shelly and Eric anxiously awaiting the birth of their child. However, the night of delivery, Eric does not show. He in fact winds up in the same hospital after being seriously injured in a car accident on the way to the hospital. He was dead for eight minutes and those eight minutes drastically changed the course of their lives.With much rehabilitation after the accident, Shelly begins noticing a change in personality with Eric. He is not the same man. Everything is different, from emotions, interests, and even sex. Shelly wants her husband back.  Did his brain change in those eight minutes? To further complicate matters, three years later, their son brings home an imaginary friend, named John. John is not a little boy, John Robberson is a fighter pilot and Vietnam Vet. Toby is very specific when describing his friend, a man.  The presence of John is strong, and his pull becomes more apparent each day and Shelly is obsessed with finding out the truth. Her marriage is falling apart and she desperately wants to protect her child. She wants her life back and her family. She wants John gone. Could John be real, and could he have anything to do with the eight minutes Eric was dead?The story began  as a family drama and slowly turned to more of a reincarnation or supernatural element, without the mystery. While I kept reading to find out what would happen next, not sure I was invested in the characters, especially Eric- felt a little removed. Being I am not a fan of paranormal, not sure I would have chosen the title. However, those who enjoy supernatural or fantasy may enjoy-- would not necessarily classify this one as women\u2019s fiction - a mix across several genres.The novel proposes many thoughts.  What happens to us after death is perhaps the greatest mystery of life. One belief is that we reincarnate; that there is life, after life. Judith D.

I was quite sure this was heading to a four star story, until the end just sort of wrapped up all to conveniently for my liking. I struggled to reconcile how the main character, who seemed quite ballsy, took the way her husband treated her (he became an almost entirely different man after an accident in which he was officially declared 'dead' for eight minutes, on the night his wife gave birth to their first child). But having some understanding of massive brain injury and how that can affect personalities so profoundly, and having NO understanding of the stresses of raising a baby in that environment - I was able to forgive that. But by crikey, I wanted to give the guy a right hook on many occasions. I love the ideas this book explored, and can well imagine the minefield it would be to explore such things if we didn't all have open minded friends, willing to consider possibilities of past life experiences, ghosts, and reincarnation, rather than have you locked up if you ever thought such things were happening to your own children. I was definitely engrossed in this story until the last 3-4 chapters. At which point, it all became a little trite - with that prize ass of a husband, suddenly became Mr Co-operative. For me, that was even less likely than a whole bunch of ghosts or reincarnated souls potentially finding ways to come back to stay close to the people they love! But I definitely liked it. This is a refreshing voice, who with a bit more research and exploration into the metaphysical, could come up with some really good novels in future."}, {"userName": "Kaeri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10842557-kaeri", "userReview": "The publisher has given me a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.What happens when we die?Where do our souls go?

The story\u2019s focus is on Shelly and I liked how the author built up her character. You\u2019ll really sympathize with her and feel for her even if she can get a bit crazy at times. All the characters, not just her, were very well-written (although, I didn't like Eric very much).

An incredible first book, it makes me anxious to read something else from this author. I liked reading the thought processes of the main character and her reluctance to admit her mistakes even to herself. It was enough detail to read as if it could have been a true story without being repetitive and irritating as it happens so many times when an author continues to review the situation in the character's mind. The relationships between the main characters are easily identifiable and contemporary. Finally, I loved that the ending did not get tied up in a nice neat bow with a gold star.

The narrative is well paced and Reisenbichler portrays the gradual development of the situation with John Robberson quite realistically. The situation develops slowly and there maintains a solid pace to show the increases of intensity and the gradual formation of the problem.The strengths are in Reisenbichler\u2019s ability to show and not tell in many instances. The growing strain on Shelly and Eric marriage, as well as the trouble of trying to navigate important conversations around a three year old is evident and it supports the story much more than if things were spelled out explicitly. The characters are compelling and real and many of the interactions are believable and suitable. As a character Shelly can be taken two ways, either as a seriously overprotective mother, or as someone who is trying to do what is best for her kid. She is clearly a mother who is trying to protect her son from something she believes may be a threat, but she is also trying to understand him and help him with the problem John Robberson is causing. It is clear she is trying to be a good mum so you cannot really fault her there, and understanding her point of view means it is hard to see her as being obsessive but it\u2019s not impossible.Where Reisenbichler uses the story, and her characters, well is how she shows both sides of the argument, and makes the readers understand them. Sometimes Shelley\u2019s actions seem on point and reasonable, whereas other times Eric\u2019s arguments seem reasonable as well, which makes the story even more captivating because it adds another level of tension and new possibilities to deal with that have been caused by the problem with Toby.Being less focused on the paranormal element of the story means this is very much a middle-class reaction to the supernatural with Googling possible causes and theories being discussed during play dates. What I liked was that the mystery and search for an explanation is not instantly solved. The story takes place over several months which add a nice realism to\u00a0it, but it also helps with the gradual progression and intensity of the problem. The concept is intriguing and the story is one that is mysterious and has a hint of the paranormal without it being full blown or overbearing.There is mystery throughout a lot of the book as you try and work out what the truth is and what it could all possibly mean, and every theory is possible when you haven\u2019t got a lot to work with. I did work out the ending from early on but the story does not necessarily head in one single direction making it evidently clear. Reisenbichler is smart at keeping the mysterious nature ongoing, but it is never overdrawn or exaggerated.Overall\u00a0this is a curious story, and one that is certainly perplexing. It has an interesting concept but what Reisenbichler has chosen to do with it gives it a new approach and certainly one that is never quite what you would expect.A longer version of this review was published on my blog https://lostinagoodbk.wordpress.com/2..."}, {"userName": "Leonor (Ner)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3648579-leonor-ner", "userReview": "Rating: 3,5 cups/starsDisclaimer: Thank you Kandy Alamenda and Lori Reisenbichler for providing me with a copy.Eight Minutes is far more than what the synopsis gives you. I started reading this book with no idea what to expect from it and in the end I admit I was surprised. When Shelly gives birth to her son Toby, her husband Erica has an accident and is dead for a total of eight minutes. She doesn\u2019t know but those eight minutes will change her life in a way she isn\u2019t expecting. Three after this wonderful and dreadful day, Toby begins talking about a man named John Robberson. When Shelly understands that Robberson isn\u2019t Toby\u2019s imaginary friend but something more, something that can actually change and harm her family, things begin to change.Lori Reisencbichler\u2018s debut novel managed to hook me almost straight away. How she built up the pace without giving too much and without going to fast helped getting to know the characters and sympathise with them. Shelly\u2019s thoughts, fears and her stress at having to deal with something she doesn\u2019t understand really gets into your skin and you end up wishing you could comfort her. The way her character was portrayed, the writing and the plot itself helped keeping the interest up and wanting to continue reading. You would always want to know what was going on despite having theories of your own.The plot of what was happening came to Shelly in a slow pace. Despite the fact that she was a very clever woman, I found it somewhat uncanny that she couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. But that detail didn\u2019t bothered me at all \u2013 if Shelly had immediately acted upon what was happening the book wouldn\u2019t have any substance at all.I have to be honest that the only reason I didn\u2019t give this book a full cup and ended up rating it 3,5 cups has to do with Eric, Shelly\u2019s husband. His character got on my nerves a few times since he was so hard to understand and to understand others. Of course that with the development of the book you get to know what\u2019s actually going inside his mind, but there were a few chapters were I simply wished Shelly to slap him or to yell at him.Other reason why I couldn\u2019t give this book a four cups rating has to do with the ending. Somehow I found the ending lacking something. The whole book had this energy to it that grabbed you instantly but the end kind of ended abruptly. I guess I was hoping for a full disclosure. Maybe this is a way for Lori Reisencbichler to allow us to have our own personal ending or to continue the story. Either way, I felt that something was amiss and that maybe the author didn\u2019t had enough time to come up with a proper ending.Overall Eight Minutes was a unique and an unusual read. With hints at the supernatural and a plot that builds up to a breathtaking page-turner, Lori Reisencbichler is an author to keep an eye out."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/628505-katie", "userReview": "No wonder it was freeWho would pay for such crap?

Shelley is a relatable flawed human being, a mother doing her best to bring up her son and manage her household. Her best-friend is supportive but culturally different and Shelley trusts her instinct and goes against her default logic to make sense of who is John Robberson.

Or is the wife the one who may be a danger to their son? Or is there an altogether different explanation for the goings-on? There are more than enough issues and ways of looking at this story to make for spirited book club discussions."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4345409-kim", "userReview": "I was given a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.This book is something lacking in literature. It is completely original. It is not a story I have read before. I found it a breath of fresh air. The book itself is very well written. I did guess part of the outcome early on (actually it's seemed rather obvious) but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it immensely. I love thrillers that deal with families and how their strength may become tested. The closer I got to the ending, the more I found myself on the edge of my seat not wanting it to end. I think it would make a great film. It reminds me of Stephen King and Dean Koontz, two of my favorite authors. I look forward to more work from this author and will recommend this book often."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2252657-kim", "userReview": "Eight minutes concerns the eight minutes her husband died before he was revived by the rescue team on the night their first child was born.

I was immediately engrossed from the first page and loved the voice of the story from the beginning. Talk about a page turner - I devoured this all in one day and had to force myself to put it down when I needed to do other things like eat. I really cared about Shelly and commiserated with everything she went through. Overall this was a very absorbing, moving, thought-provoking novel that I am happy to have read. I will definitely keep an eye out for future works from Lori Reisenbichler!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61068-jennifer", "userReview": "In this novel, on the night her son was born, the protagonist's husband was in a terrible accident and was dead for the titular eight minutes. 3 years later, things are mostly okay, until their son starts talking about someone who seems less like an imaginary friend and more like a real person. Is there a ghost, is he reincarnated, is his mom just going crazy? Works well as both a domestic drama and a psychological suspense, though I must admit I guessed the twist pretty early on. Still, I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down.

The story dwelled not on the NDE itself, but on what happens to the person as well as to the people around him/her after such an experience. This is something well thought of and brilliantly written.It was very well that the story was related from Shelly's point of view. Just the same, my empathy was not totally lost for the other characters. I very much like the way Shelly fought for her marriage while stealthily (thought without success) pursuing the answers to her many questions.I will definitely look for more from this author."}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10488420-meg", "userReview": "I liked the premise of this book and was drawn into the story. As someone who works with dying people, thus on the line between two worlds, I'm not at all surprised that it took 2 intelligent Western adults a long time to \"get it\". The fact that the couple's viewpoints differed dramatically was both realistic and made the book more interesting. This is a skillful treatment of a challenging subject (the \"paranormal\") As the arc of the story descended to the ending, the deepening relationships of the protagonists were well drawn. I recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30523746-debbie", "userReview": "This was a good book. It starts out with the main character in the hospital in labor wondering where her husband is. She finds out that he had been in an accident on the way to the hospital and was seriously hurt. In fact he dies for 8 minutes.What happened during that 8 minutes changed they're life forever. John is not the same person afterwards, everything is differant. Then one day they're little boy says he has an new friend. If you didn't believe in reincarnation you might after reading this story."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5151012-alan", "userReview": "I was riveted to this book! I was mesmerised and couldn't wait to find out what was happening and whether it was real or imagined. I really liked the main character & narrator, Shelly, a mum who worries that her toddler, Toby, has been inhabited by a spirit. Shelly was easy to identify with and very human, and Toby was a completely lovable kid. I also enjoyed the other characters, Shelly's unsupportive husband and her supportive friends. I think the ultimate reason I enjoyed this book was its language - the narration and dialogue was relatable and rang true."}], "description": "On the night that Shelly Buckner finally became a mother, she very nearly became a widow.
