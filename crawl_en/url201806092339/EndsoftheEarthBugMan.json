I couldn't help feeling that the author didn't really grasp the organic foods concept.There is no way three people are gonna stand around discussing what they know about the bad guy when said bad guy has a lethal weapon out, ready to kill one of them. This is something Columbo would do and it's frankly stupid.If you were an active person and had hair down to your hips, wouldn't you put it in a bun or ponytail? Exactly. I think the author was trying to make Alena mysterious, but she comes across instead as unrealistic. And why do the women in his stories have to be so \"beautiful\"? Alena, Kathryn, Macy, even the autistic girl. I mean, come on. What's wrong with \"pretty\" or \"cute\"? And, anyway, what's the deal with equating beauty to goodness? Sounds like the author's fantasizing here.The whole combine/lost girl scene felt contrived and unnecessary.By the book's end I was indifferent as to which woman he ended up with, though I think it should be pretty clear who he proposes to. What's the most important thing in the world to Nick? Bugs. Kathryn hates them. Alena doesn't. Dilemma solved.All that said, yeah, it was a pleasant enough read."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7738222-tracey", "userReview": "I love the bug man novels.

Couldn\u2019t put it downRecommendation: Fans of save-the-world-at-last-minute action and fans of clueless and quirky heroesNick Polchak is back, and his love and knowledge of bugs comes with him. He is called to the site of a murder, recommended by the victim\u2019s wife. Nick must use his knowledge and experience of bugs and murder to unravel the truth that surrounds the mystery of Michael\u2019s death. Katherine remembers working with Nick before and some old feelings resurface. When the need of a dog team arises, Nick immediately calls on Alena and her pack of dogs. Alena has not forgotten how things ended between her and Nick the last time they worked together. Now the Bug Man is faced with the murder that points to threat of terrorism as well as two women who are vying for his attention. What can I say? I am a huge Tim Downs fan, and there is yet to be a book of his that I don\u2019t like. I have to say that I read this one a little bit faster than the other ones. But that was because I accidentally started reading the next one, Nick of Time, and realized that there was a lot that I had missed in the previous book. And I have to say that I am not disappointed in going back to this one. Yes, there was the possibility of a terrorist attack that the victim unknowingly becomes a part of. But as more bodies come to light, and other weird occurrences are explained, the closer Nick comes to closer to solving the mystery. The terrorist whose plans Nick has yet to uncover are nothing compared to mystery of the two women who are obviously after Nick\u2019s heart. He hates to admit it, but is forced to deal with the fact that he is no longer part of the insect species. Though he is not familiar with the swirl of emotions that are going on inside of him, he knows that it undoubtedly makes him part of the human race. Though it would really be clich\u00e9 to say that every book is an adventure, it would always be the truth. One of the main reasons that I like the Bug Man novels is that you can get so wrapped up in his world, though it\u2019s informative of all things insects, they are more of a side note than a central character. Nick, on the other hand is full of quirks and flaws. He is filled with sarcasm and able to toss out a snarky comment that flusters or upsets the other characters, but the reader can\u2019t help but laugh. There are certain things that have become Nickisms, and are expected in all of the novels. But they are never overdone and always have a way to sneak in. If there is ever a time I am in need of an entomologist, I pray that I am lucky enough to encounter one like Nick. He\u2019s got to be out there somewhere, right? If only the world was so lucky."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3450884-barbara", "userReview": "Tim Downs' Bug Man series, which features a sarcastic, eccentric forensic entomologist named Nick Polchak, is one of the best mystery series out there. In this fifth outing, Nick is called upon to investigate a murder at an organic farm in North Carolina, where he lives. He's surprised to find that the murder victim (named Michael Severenson) is the late husband of Kathleen Guilford, a woman whom Nick once had feelings for (see \"Shoofly Pie\"). A narcotics dog team is suggested by local police, and Nick asks for help from Alena, a dog trainer known as the Witch of Endor (readers remember her from \"Less than Dead\"). While Nick investigates the murder, both Alena and Kathleen subtly (and sometimes not-so-subtly) compete for Nick's affections, with Alena bonding with Kathleen's autistic daughter Callie, who loves Alena's dogs.The murder, far from being a simple case of a drug bust gone bad, soon has multiple suspects--including Kathleen herself. Downs weaves a scary tale of using bugs as part of an eco-terror attack on the United States, which sounds farfetched until Nick explains how this works as the story evolves. At stake are global food prices as Russia seeks to supplant the United States in corn production. Also noted is the fact that the United States uses corn for ethanol, a type of biofuel, while Africans who desperately need corn for food continue to starve. Downs' characters, while a bit off-the-wall, are all realistic. He also has a knack for writing snappy, amusing dialogue, most of which comes from one-liners that Polchak uses to deflect unwanted questions (such as which woman does he really want? And does he really want either of them?). There are also great scenes, such as Kathleen's giving Alena a makeover before her 'date' with Nick--they go to a university social as well as a look inside Nick's classroom where his students present projects such as maggot therapy and the life-cycles of resident Carolinian insects. This is a terrific standalone mystery and a welcome addition to the Bug Man series."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1550566-denise", "userReview": "Excellent. This is a story of Nick, an entomologist, aka the \"Bug Man\" who helps law enforcement by using the life cycle of insects to determine time of death.

An old female friend, Kathryn, who owns an organic farm, calls for his help to discover who killed her husband. She has a young autistic daughter, Callie.

Nick Polchak is back, and he is as delightfully brilliant and bone-headed as ever! If you\u2019re not familiar with award-winning author Tim Downs\u2019 unusual protagonist from any of the previous 4 mystery novels in the Bug Man series, you\u2019re in for a treat. His blisteringly funny sarcastic wit with students and colleagues, his total and utter cluelessness regarding women, his fascination with insects to the point of identifying with them more than humans, and his stunningly brilliant ability to help solve crimes through the study of bugs makes him one of the quirkiest, most intriguing amateur detectives imaginable. \tAs in the previous novels, Nick is faced with the challenge of unraveling a murder mystery, but this one has international entanglements, and cataclysmic consequences of global proportions. If that weren\u2019t enough, Nick also finds himself in not just one, but two potential romantic relationships with women from past cases. Watching Nick painstakingly put the pieces of the mystery together in his inimitable fashion is always worth the read, but watching him struggle to even understand both women, much less take his first halting steps towards his first romantic relationship in the midst of a case was vastly entertaining! Ends of the Earth is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable novels I\u2019ve read in a long time, and I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough!"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1733268-laura", "userReview": "I know this is the 5th book in the Bug Man series, but it is the first one I have had the pleasure of reading. I immediately liked Nick and found his humor to be refreshing. He is too-smart and has zero social skills and knows it. He laughs at himself and just accepts himself for the way that he is. I loved his character! Maybe because I am an engineer and know plenty of people like him, I found him endearing.Even though I have never read any of the other books in the series, I did not feel lost. I am sure a number of the characters have been mentioned in other books, but past interactions with Nick were not necessary to make this story whole. It was excellent as a stand alone book.I enjoyed every bit of this book. There was plenty of humor and wit right along with a good suspense story. The story is well written and believable. I know very little about bugs and farming, but none of the story was too overwhelming and the premise of it was well-developed and timely. I finished this book in the best way possible--with a smile on my face and ready to read more from the characters.Okay, so the ending was a big of a hanger and it can be annoying, but I found it funny and was not bothered by it in the least. I am looking forward to more from the Bug Man series and plan on going back and reading the first four in the series. *I received this book from Amazon Vine*"}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188312-brad", "userReview": "Arthur, you win. This is one of the cases where I'd like a little more granularity in my ratings, as I would probably call this one a 3.5. Polchak is still the enjoyable protagonist that we've come to love over the previous four books.The bad guys this time have agroterrorist plans to destroy a portion of the US food supply. The agro/bioterrorist angle was one that I liked a lot, as this (and obviously biodefense) is one of my favorite subjects in microbiology. My biggest complaints are that it felt like Downs sort of got on a soapbox about organic farming and that some of the exposition felt a little forced (some of the explanations that were given by characters talking to each other were pretty obvious info dumps and didn't seem like natural things that they would have said).Polchak also has to deal with women in this novel, as two of the ladies from his past have major roles and both want a major piece of him. Who will he choose? The book doesn't actually say--you find out when you read the synopsis of book 6. Either way, I had some mixed feelings about the whole romance situation in the book, and was trying to decide whether the women were behaving realistically. I still haven't reached a conclusion.Rating: PG-13, for some non-gory violence."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1757121-sharon", "userReview": "Tim Downs has created an entertaining protagonist in Nick Polchak, a forensic entomologist (also known as \"the bug man\"). Polchak is an academic who is pulled into a murder case to help establish the post-mortem interval on the victim -- who happens to be the estranged husband of Nick's former girlfriend. Another former girlfriend is pulled into the mix because she has a cadaver dog ... and there is one set of issues already, as I'm sure you can imagine.Now put agroterrorism into the mix, based on the true geopolitics of the corn farming industry. In other words, \"Ends of the Earth\" is not just another police procedural; it's an international espionage story as well. Polchak finds himself in over his head more than once.The characters are well-developed and interesting, and it's easy to find a soft spot in one's heart for just about all of them -- even the villains, who see themselves as ultimately helping the world economy with their actions.Downs has left a cliff-hanger for his readers, with alternate endings available for view on his website so that readers may vote on them.

As is standard for this series, the reader is never in any doubt as to \"whodunnit;\" our enjoyment is in seeing Nick figure it out. Two of the strongest female characters from the previous novels make appearances here, which I enjoyed. I also appreciated the plot, which centered on agro-terrorism, although frankly it was fell into the \"all too plausible\" category. Willful destruction of the entire US corn crop... frightening stuff! I am giving this one a mere three stars because I was a little annoyed by the gimmicky ending, after which the author requests his readers vote on two alternates on his website. I would have preferred the character make his mind up on his own. I also could not help but notice two minor continuity errors surrounding the character of Kathryn Guilford: this book stated that the fatal car accident of \"Shoo Fly Pie\" occurred when she was four (that book said she was seven), and that Guilford was her maiden name (it was her first husband's.)

I have one tiny beef--but if I mention, I'd be guilty of revealing too much--it'd be a spoiler. Suffice to say, this novel has a terrific tightly written plot with all the wit and informational tidbits I've grown to love in previous Bug Man books. I feel well-acquainted with Dr. Nick Polchak, entomologist, by this fifth episode. His skill at deducing the significance of insect activity is phenomenal. But without his a quirky personality, he'd be a tad boring. (The guy thinks he's an insect, for pity's sake!) He's torn between two women this time, a new and baffling condition for a loner with such poor relational skills. Which one will he choose?

By far the funniest book in the series in my opinion. Nick finds himself between two women, Kathryn and Alena, as he must track down an agroterrorist plot.

I haven't read the 4th book in the series which is apparently where Alena is introduced (they don't have the book at either of the libraries here - but I have it bought and on the way). With the cliffhanger ending of who he is going to marry I figured I should read Less than Dead to learn more about Alena before reading Nick of Time (I have no clue who he chooses so that's not a spoiler in any way of the next book).
