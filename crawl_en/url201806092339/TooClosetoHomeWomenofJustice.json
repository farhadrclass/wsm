That makes me sad to say about Christian writers but often I feel like the writing is mediocre at best but since it says good stuff about God it's left alone.Within 50 pages I was rolling my eyes. The story seems very redone, conversations are stilted and unnatural and the love at first sight thing is ridiculous. I did not buy the reactions to the similarities between the wife that died and Sam. Even if they looked a lot alike, a sixteen-year-old would not whisper \"mama\" at the sight of her.There are so many cliches! And if a simile/metephor can be used it is even if it's forced.Close to the end there is a section that really stands out in need of editing. \"She'd been right. [The door] was open. Conner banged on it with his fist and it swung open with a crash. A SWAT member kicked the door in,...\" Really? It's open. Why kick it?The characters are flat to me and I'm generally disinterested. A part that should have illicited an emotional response just left me shrugging.I want to like Christian writers better but I need both them and their editors to do better."}, {"userName": "Loraine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1922494-loraine", "userReview": "This book was incredible.

With her expertise in computer forensics, she hopes she is able to dig deep enough to find what the other task forces have missed in solving this case.Homicide detective Connor Wolfe is being pulled in two directions. He knows he needs to spend time mending his strained relationship with Jenna, his defiant teenage daughter, but with a killer on the loose, he devotes his time and energy to the case at hand, causing Jenna to rebel even further.There is immediate chemistry between Samantha and Connor, but for the sake of the case and their race against time, they put personal feelings aside and concentrate on the killer that continues to slip from their grasp. When the killer decides to make his game personal, both Samantha and Connor realize how much they stand to lose as time continues to tick away.I'm hooked! A long time Dee Henderson fan, I've now found another author that compels me to turn page after page. Sure, maybe all of the protocols and procedures weren't exactly on point as other reviewers stated, but Eason's writing technique and ability to captivate an audience far out-shined those minor flaws. I am all for realism, but for me, escapism is the name of the game and while reading this novel, I definitely felt as if I was running alongside Samantha and Connor in their race against time.My only negative regarding TOO CLOSE TO HOME is the fact that I didn't really get to see Connor and Samantha explore their feelings for each other until the end of the book. I am not a fan of keeping the hero and heroine at arm's length until the last few pages. But overall, a great suspenseful read."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah", "userReview": "Excellent romantic suspense. The romance is mostly a side subject, with the suspense building as the killer sets his sights on the team hunting him down. The first half was a bit slow for me, and took me a while to care about the characters, especially when one I liked falls in the line of duty. In the end, the main characters had a nice ending, though it was rushed but two things seemed to not be concluded: was A. \"The Boss\" or not? And did they ever find Sydney's body? Was it unanswered or simply carried to the next book?I'm looking forward to Jamie's story."}, {"userName": "Jolene", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3299958-jolene", "userReview": "I rarely rip apart a book. But this? I can't even figure out where to start?OK, OK. COMPLETELY UNBELIEVABLE. There. That's a place to start. It was horribly written. I felt like the setting was never completely developed. I had this sense at one point that its big city, then it feels small town. I was totally lost. Then, the sequence of horrifying events - they just weren't realistic. I don't know why I read stories like this. I feel like Eason didn't do her research. Things like when the detective makes an announcement at the school. It would NEVER EVER HAPPEN LIKE THAT. I work in a school. I know. Especially now in today's society (in which this book was set). I just had to laugh.The romantic story didn't make sense. It happened to fast, and in a sort of unbelievable way. There's always a twist too - but it just made the story worse to read.The worst part? I read the whole book. I wasted precious sleeping time over this story. I wouldn't read the next in the series. I wouldn't recommend this book.

Aren\u2019t you exaggerating just a tad, my boy?).A lot of initial fanfare for such a measly parade.

Once I got halfway through the book, it seemed to be a little better as I got used to it.I did notice a mistake where the author wrote that a door was open, but then S.W.A.T had to break it down, that was just a little bit confusing.Likes-Sam and Conner's relationship - It was very sweet and gentle romance. And the fact that the romance was a sideline thing was nice, as I prefer more action than mush.Jenna - At times I was yelling at Jenna (in my head) for doing things that I knew was going to end badly, but she redeemed herself in the end when she used amazing courage to overcome the mess she was in.  I liked the aspects of faith and salvation woven into this story. It really was nice and didn't come off as a preachy type of salvation story.I really love Mrs. Eason's works and I look forward to reading the rest of the series and any other books of hers in the future!"}, {"userName": "Kaylea", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883357-kaylea", "userReview": "Ok, when the publisher says \"read this one with the lights on\" um.... you better read it with the lights on - or at least don't do what I did and read it while house/dog sitting.Let's just say, I didn't sleep much that night, because just as I got to an \"intense\" part, the dog I was watching proceeded to \"bark\" at something in the yard. (Yes, the rational part of my mind knew it was a skunk, rabbit or some other creature, but well, the subconscious mind was a bit freaked out).I liked the characters introduced by Eason. I've read some of her other, shorter novels, and I appreciated how in this one, she was able to delve into the back story of the main characters. I think this added depth to the story.I also liked the twists and turns found in the novel. Without giving it away, Eason managed to stump me - which was a pleasant surprise!The only \"down side\" is that I figured out the \"main\" story theme - but not the ultimate villain - because well, I watch way too much CSI and Criminal Minds (I'm pretty sure this was in a Criminal Minds episode this season....which means it was a case of great minds thinking alike since both were probably written simultaneously,)I'm really looking forward to the next novel, to see where Eason takes this series. Keep reading - spoiler alert - information about book two in the series can be found below.On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest, this book is definitely a 4. You'll probably want to keep this book around to read more than once - because if you are like me, you'll read it fast, the first time, to find out just what happens to Cash and the other characters. On the second time through, you can appreciate the different references and items Eason sprinkles throughout her manuscript."}, {"userName": "Rexine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7882754-rexine", "userReview": "This review is from: Too Close to Home (Women of Justice Series #1) (Kindle Edition)I have been struggling to figure out how to review this book. I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it. I finished it but rather than the average three days it takes for me to devour a book, it took over a week.I loved the characters, their own personal strengths and weaknesses. I love how Connor struggled to be a devoted father and cop, wanting both but not able to figure out how. The story was good, but not gripping, the ending was, however, intense and exciting...just took a while to reach the point of exciting.I think its always hard to find a suspense/Christian story where the characters faith doesn't come in at the worst possible times. I mean to say faith should be paramount during times of struggle, but not like...\"hey, I know we are in a gun fight, but you know Jesus loves you right\" it was hard to stay engaged when the story started to get intense and then it would switch to the characters struggle with faith and the intensity would drop off.I gave it 3.5 as it was a good action and suspense story, the characters faith was encouraging the romance not overbearing and out of place, but just didn't feel the suspense and faith storyline was executed right. But I'm not an author, I'm not an expert, I'm not an authority on how it should be done.There are other books in this series, but I'm not sure if I feel inspired enough by this one to buy them and see how the other characters develop, although, Dakota sounds dreamy and he may be worth it..."}, {"userName": "Erin Butler", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4787973-erin-butler", "userReview": "I'm trying to decide whether or not 3 stars is too generous.The plot line was decent, at best. I figured out who the killer was by chaper four. The auther didn't really draw in many new details or suspects, and the characters seemed to circle endlessly around the same basic facts for most of the story.Also, what city cops drive mustangs and corvettes? Seriously.The part that annoyed me the most about his book, however, was the poor writing. The author's sentence structure was terrible. She also used way too much \"fluffing\" material, and rarely made good use of adjectives.The lady cop was WAY too emotional to actually be a cop. And then the whole \"love at first sight\" factor was ridiculous.I rarely read Christian fiction. I've found very little in that genre to actually be quality writing.

People look at me funny when I tell them that I am a sucker for a good romance but that is part of my makeup and that is that. However, give me a romance where cars get blown up, there are sniper attacks and there is a sociopath on the loose and I am a very happy person. It has a lot to do with testosterone I suppose.Connor Wolfe is the agent in charge of an investigation into the kidnappings of several teenagers; a few of which have been discovered murdered with no clues to how or why. Samantha Cash is brought in to the case because of the need to investigate a link to a possible on-line predator. Connor is a widower with a teenage daughter who maybe dealing with the very on-line predator her dad is seeking. Samantha has a sister that is dealing with the results of a major trauma. Together these two bring all this baggage into the case and begin to build a romance on top of trying to catch a kidnapper/killer.\"Too Close To Home\" is a thriller, no doubt about it. Both Connor and Samantha are in deadly danger from page one. What sets this book apart from others in this genre is that the hero is in need of salvation. Normally the hero & heroine bring some other character to salvation but here the need is on Connor. There are so many wonderful themes in this book. The characters are so real and you root for them to complete their mission and you root for their romance to blossom. Ms. Eason knows how to tell a story that keeps you flipping the pages and guessing as to who the bad guys really are. This is an exciting read and I recommend it highly (as long as you are like me and like exploding cars, sniper attacks and a sociopath mixed in with your romance). I am looking forward the the next book in the series.If you missed the interview for \"Too Close To Home\" and would like to listen to it please go to www.kingdomhighlights.org where it is available On Demand.To listen to 24 Christian music please visit our internet radio station www.kingdomairwaves.orgDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Revell Publishers.

Lynette Eason is one gifted suspense writer and after this book she moved up the ranks of favourite suspense writers.The characters. I loved the characters. They were real dealing with real issues. I loved how Lynette showed the reader the inner conflicts the characters are dealing with. This made them feel like someone you know, not a fictitious character.The romance. The romance was not over the top at all. The suspense and the murder stories got more of the limelight of the book, the romance was secondary and not in your face. I loved this.The suspense: Wow, the plot felt like it could be one episode of criminal minds. The suspect was twisted. The writer wrote some scenes from the culprit's view point and you can't believe how twisted this subject was. The suspense was fast and building and there was so many twists that kept me guessing. About 80% in the book I thought I knew who it was, but the way the rest was written , bouncing from the cops to the culprit's view point, confused me up to almost 90% when it was revealed. That for me is great suspense - keeping me guessing right up till the end.Oh and the epilogue - I was planning to read another book first, but the epilogue made me open the second book in the series right away!Highly recommended to all suspense fans!"}, {"userName": "Iola", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164070-iola", "userReview": "I really like Dee Henderson's writing, and have had trouble finding a worthy sucessor since she seems to have stopped writing. Lynette Eason is the first writer who has come close - not totally suprising, as she says in her author note that Dee Henderson has been her mentor for many years. The story is about a widowed detective working on a case of missing teenage girls that have started to turn up dead. At the same time, he is dealing with problems at home, with a rebellious teenage daughter who blames him for her mother's death. As the case progresses, he meets Samantha, an FBI IT expert, and feels an instant attraction, not least because she initially reminds him of his dead wife. She also feels the attraction, but, as a Christian, does not want to pursue a relationship with a non-believer, least of all a cop.This was a free Kindle/Kobo download, the first in a Christian romantic suspense series. Yes, I liked it, and I will be buying the next in the series - hopefully it is as good. My only complaint is that the Jenna sub-plot was a bit predictable, and I worked out who-dun-it about 2/3 of the way through the book, suggesting it was a bit obvious (I don't usually get it that quickly, which might just say more about me than the author...)

I will try to be positive. I actually liked the story. I liked where the story was going. My problem with this book is 1. there is no spacing between the end of one scene and the beginning of another. 2. The bad guy was known as \"The Agent\". If FBI Agents are a part of your story, don't name the bad guy \"Agent\", Especially if there is no spacing between the actual FBI agents talking and the \"Agent\" talking. Are you confused yet? I was. 3. I found a lot of grammar mistakes. 4. There is a lot of religion in this book, that almost came off as everyone peer pressuring this guy to go to church. I'm not apposed to religion in books, but it just was too much and not woven into the story very well.

For someone to be able to write mystery novels that keep you on the edge of your seat, but to also write them in a way that glorifies our heavenly Father.. Remarkable! \"Too Close To Home\" was action packed from beginning to end with amazing characters to keep you hooked from the first page until the very last. From FBI Agents, SLED Detectives to Regular Law Enforcement, there was never a shortage of individuals willing to lay down there lives for someone else. There were a few scenes that I wish I could erase, just due to the victims lives that were lost, but I know that as in real life- the story wouldn't be the way it was without it. The only issue that I found with this novel was the way it changed from one person's view to another without warning. There was a few different times that I have to stop, reread, and begin again because I couldn't figure out who was supposed to be talking.

This hits very close to home, as he himself has a teenage daughter in this town. He is determined to figure out what the link is between all these girls disappearing, and finding them alive if possible. Also called into the case is Special Agent Samantha Cash from the FBI. An expert computer analysist, she will take the computers and examine every part possible and even those parts thought to be erased. Thrown together by work, the attraction is immediate, however very disconcerting to Detective Wolfe. Samantha looks very much like his wife who had died several years earlier in an accident. Even his daughter was amazed by the resemblance. Finding a couple of the missing girls dead, puts the heat on, and a news conference turns the heat up on the killer, and also enrages him, causing him to go on a shooting spree, which kills Detective Wolfe's partner and friend Andrew. Will Connor and Samantha be able to stop this madman before more people are killed? How many of the missing girls will they find. As I finished this book, my first thought was WOW this would make an awesome episode for that detective show that features the FBI profiler team.

Too Close to Home grabbed me from page one, and didn't let go 'til the very end.

Those of you who know me well will understand what I mean by not being able to go on. I'm not a fan of in-depth descriptions of murderous crimes -- or anything involving blood, gore, intense cruelty, etc. -- but, I seem to be drawn to them regardless. I'm SO glad I took the time to read Too Close to Home, and I am SO excited that I get to read book #2, Don't Look Back, over the weekend. HOORAY!!!I always try my hardest to unravel the mystery as quickly as possible, but usually end up being completely bowled-over in the last few pages. However, I'm happy to say, I actually figured this one out in just a few chapters. I'm not sure what gave it away, but something just clicked and I knew who \"The Agent\" was, as well as, the reasons behind his horrendous actions. It cast a completely different aspect on the story -- because I could see it from both sides -- which was an intriguing change of pace.The story revolves around teenage girls being propositioned by an online predator, who they believe to be a modeling agent. He chats with them until they get comfortable enough to send their picture to him, and eventually agree to meet him in person. In this day and age, with technology so easily accessible by kids and teens -- this is a scary reality check for any parent.I wasn't sure how God would be incorporated into this gripping story, but Ms. Eason made everything flow so perfectly that I was amazed with how naturally He fit into every situation.

I really would have liked to give it a 4-star rating, but the plot proved too irritating.I don\u2019t mind feeling a little smarter than the average bear, but it seemed to me that Connor Wolfe and, later, Samantha missed putting together a lot of clues that were laid out for them, and not just available to the reader through the killer\u2019s POV.For one thing, the fact that the investigators didn't consider the possibility of an adoption ring right off seems implausible, as does the form some of the clues take: for example, what kid doing something her parents wouldn't approve of prints out an IM? The police procedure and interagency ops, particularly with the car bombing, also didn\u2019t seem realistic.The conflict between being a cop and being a dad is powerful and plausible, though; I\u2019ll grant the author some extra points on that aspect of Connor\u2019s character. But why would a cop dad fail to inform his daughter about the specific danger posed by this Internet stalker--after she's been threatened? I know that\u2019s not how it works in my own extended family.A few other points likewise pulled me out of the story, and I nearly didn\u2019t finish this book. Would middle-class girls really need to go to a backroom abortion clinic rather than Planned Parenthood? In what normal medical clinic can these would-be models get complete physicals without their parents knowing... or getting a bill? Why would a police officer who knows he's a target fail to wear his protective vest?As some of the other reviewers have noted, the identity of the Agent was clear to me early on. I was expecting Boss to be someone of the opposite sex, though, so the author did surprise me on that account.I certainly would read more of Lynette Eason\u2019s books, even more of this series, but I downloaded this suspense novel for free during a brief promotion, and I would have been bitterly disappointed if I\u2019d paid full price for it."}, {"userName": "Janna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1705916-janna", "userReview": "Every once in awhile a book comes along that just begs to be in a series so I have something to look forward to when the book ends, \"Too Close To Home\" is one of those books.

The book opens with Conner arriving at the scene of another dead body. She is young, obviously murdered and has one very unusual feature... she has been pregnant recently. A pattern is developing, girls disappear for a extended period of time and then show up dead, murdered differently, but recently pregnant. No babies, just signs of pregnancy. These girls are being stalked before they go missing, the police intend to find out how before more girls go missing. Samantha Cash is an expert with computers and they bring her in to figure out the connection between their internet activity and the disappearances.Both Connor and Samantha bring plenty of drama to the table. Connor has a teenage daughter of his own who is struggling with a daddy who isn't around and her mother passed away 4 years before - they are both missing her. Samantha has a sister who suffered a tragedy that she hasn't fully recovered from and it has left Samantha feeling very responsible for her. Together they deal with their personal lives, fight the bad guys and start falling for each other. All while the bad guys are getting \"Too Close For Home\".This book is a definite nail biter as the story races to the finish, time is ticking and Lynette doesn't waste a single word in her writing. Everything has meaning and you will literally hold your breath. I am thrilled that we will see these characters back in a second book and it looks like Samantha's sister Jamie will take the lead... I can't wait to see how the characters advance in book #2. Congratulations on a great new series, Lynette!"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5396610-melanie", "userReview": "Review on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/review/R23DBOSA...Review on my blog (to be posted 2/21): http://christianbookshelfreviews.blog...Too Close to Home was another great suspense read! Having read two of Lynette Eason's newer books (When the Smoke Clears and When a Heart Stops), I was excited to finally read one of her older novels.The mystery was really good and I loved that I was actually able to guess correctly about who the killer was! The case was very attention grabbing and there were many super suspenseful scenes.I loved the characters and, even though I found Jenna to be a little foolish sometimes, she was still a favorite - along with her dad and Dakota. =)The only thing that sort of bugged me was how long it took to reveal who the killer was, and then when he/she was revealed, it seemed like it was supposed to be a surprise, when it was pretty obvious by then. This probably only annoyed me because I had guessed who it was fairly early on in the book. I still went back-and-forth, though, about my guess and was surprised that my initial thought was correct.Still, I loved Too Close to Home and now need to read book two, Don't Look Back, asap. The epilogue was a real teaser! I recommend this book if you enjoy suspense novels with some romance. It was great!*I did not get this book for review. I bought it when it was free on Amazon Kindle. All thoughts and opinions expressed are my own.*"}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7297738-colleen", "userReview": "I had to read this book in fits and starts because I couldn't decide how I felt about it from one day to the next. It took me far longer to read than my average. The plot was mostly suspenseful, but I felt like there were too many detours here. I get that it's a Christian book and that's fine, but I felt like there were two novels being written here, and they just didn't mesh very well. The parts focusing on quetsions of faith felt way too forced and I struggled not to skim past them, which is sad, but true. Additionally, it was extrememly annoying to see the supposedly fantastic cop, Connor, constantly NOT telling his daughter about the details of the case - not warning her how the missing girls were tricked and kidnapped. That is just TOTALLY unrealistic. Any cop who is that careful and that good at his job is going to be very closely watching his own daughter, especially when she is exactly the same age and from the same school/community as the other girls. It just makes no sense. I suspected who the bad guy was, but wasn't entirely sure which was refreshing, and other than the obtrusive faith thread of the story and the HUGE blind spot of not comminicating with his daughter, it would have been rather good. I really wanted to like this book, but it was frustrating. I was very interested in the ending, but I don't think I'll be struggling through another novel in this series. Overall, it was a disappointment."}, {"userName": "Wendy Sparkes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8009950-wendy-sparkes", "userReview": "Missing teens are turning up dead.Connor Wolfe, homicide detective with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, has been drafted in to help, & this case has him by the throat.

I picked this book up as a free Kindle title, and was a bit wary about starting it, as my tastes have been gradually moving away from mystery books and heading for romances. I was pleasantly surprised by this book though! It mixed elements of a mystery with a romance pretty seamlessly and I began to care about what happened to the characters. From the beginning, it reminded me of a Criminal Minds episode, which is one of my favorite television shows. Later on in the story, the author introduced a character that I *knew* would become a Bones type character later on (which she does in the second book in the series!)I found the Christianity woven into the story nicely, and it brought the Hero character into a better focus for me, showing me more of his flaws and making him seem more real to me. I think it brought a good balance to the book, without being too \"preachy\".If you are looking for a strong female lead, this is not the book for you. The heroine in this story is brought in as a consultant, so she is not the \"point man\" on this case. However, I didn't find her to be weak or beneath the men she worked with on the case, she just had different strengths than they did.All in all, I must say that this is an interesting and engaging start to this series, and I would recommend this book to others!"}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "When one girl went missing, there was some concern. Though when another girl went missing shortly after the first one, people started to panic; especially when the body of one of the missing girls turns up. FBI Special Agent Samantha Cash is called onto the case to assist, Homicide detective Connor Wolfe. Connor is good at his job. Some of Samantha\u2019s techniques throw him for a loop. Though when it comes to this case, he is fine with letting Samantha take the lead. You know when you parents warned you about meeting people online, they weren\u2019t saying it annoy you but to protect you. Just when Samantha and Connor think they are getting closer to the killer; a turn of event brings the case even closer to home for Connor then he ever wished. The killer has targeted his daughter, Jenna. Will Samantha and Connor be able to stop the killer before it is too late. Too Close to Home is book one of the Women of Justice series. I thought this book was a pretty good start to this series. Samantha and Connor worked well together as a team. It was nice to see a female lead character be so strong and in charge. There was an issue with the killer in this story. While, I didn\u2019t need this book to be gruesome but I would have liked to have seen the killer become a more prominent character in this book. Though, I can\u2019t wait to see how this story all plays out in book two."}], "description": "Samantha Cash is the FBI's secret weapon. Her methods are invisible, and she never stops until the case is closed. When missing teens begin turning up dead in a small Southern town, Samantha is assigned to help local chief Connor Wolfe find the killer. And he has two problems with that. There's her faith--in God and herself. And then there's the fact that she looks exactly like his late wife. As they get close to an answer, the case becomes personal. The killer seems to be taking an interest in Connor's 16-year-old daughter, who thinks her dad is getting way too protective. Can't a girl just have some fun?
