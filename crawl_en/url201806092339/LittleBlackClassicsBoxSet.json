The rate in which I\u2019ve been reading them has decreased considerably as time went on. I used to review one a week, but it eventually got the point that is was a struggle to do one a month. And now I admit it, I\u2019ve finally thrown in the towel. I managed to read 71/80 of these little books, though I\u2019ve come to the point where the remaining nine just make me feel sad. I don\u2019t want to read them! They are all the ones that I\u2019ve been avoiding and life\u2019s too short to read books that I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m going to end up giving the majority of them bad reviews anyway. So I\u2019ve decided to leave them, and put the remainder back on my shelf never to be read. That being said though, there have been some great things in this series. I completed my goal of increasing my literary awareness and finding a few authors I may never have encountered. All in all, there have been many ups and downs. So this review is a summary of my experience, highlighting the three I enjoyed the most. \n1. The Night is Darkening Around Me by Emily Bronte\n- Penguin Little Black Classic- 63\u201cThe night is darkening round me, The wild winds coldly blow; But a tyrant spell has bound me, And I cannot, cannot go.\u201dTrapped, that\u2019s what the speaker is: she is completely trapped. But what\u2019s retraining her? Is it some deep corner of her conscience or is it some powerful external force? These lingering questions are reinforced in an obscure way through the poem. Firstly, she is held in place by a binding darkness; secondly, she is weighed down by the surrounding forest, and thirdly she is stuck between the sky and the earth. Something is holding her back. But, what is it? Is it her will or something more ominous? \u201cThe giant trees are bending Their bare boughs weighed with snow; The storm is fast descending, And yet I cannot go.\" As the poem progresses this develops further. Certainly, she speaks of physical restraints; however the poem evokes the distinct feeling that she doesn\u2019t want to go. It\u2019s not a simple case of not being able to go, but a more subtle suggestion that she doesn\u2019t want to go. She is possibly stuck, with a complete lack of freedom, but she doesn\u2019t entirely care as well. It\u2019s almost like she has accepted this situation. It can even be read from the point of view that she is not in these places at all; she is somewhere else entirely: she is where she wants to be, and these monumental forces of nature cannot move her from her sanctuary. Whether this is a sanctuary of the mind, spirit or physical realms one can only speculate. Whichever way this poem is read, one thing remains certain, she doesn\u2019t want to go nor can she go.\u201cClouds beyond clouds above me, Wastes beyond wastes below; But nothing drear can move me; I will not, cannot go.\" This poem is very open ended; I always love this in a poem. This was my favourite in the edition, but that\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t any other good ones in here. There are a lot of fantastic verses. \u2018Death\u2019 was also quite good. I do love the Bronte sisters. I need to read more of their works. This was a great collection of poetry, one that I\u2019m likely to revisit. 2. A Cup of Sake Beneath the Cherry Trees by Kenko - Penguin Little Black Classic- 11\n What strange folly, to beguile the tedious hours like this all day before my ink stone, jotting down at random the idle thoughts that cross my mind\n Well, the first sentence certainly caught my attention because that\u2019s exactly what I do with my book reviews. I sit in front of my notebook, with my pen in hand, and write the first thought that comes into my head in regards to the book. Admittedly, the train of thought is less random, but I still write down what comes to my mind. Later on, I organise it and turn it into a coherent book review. I only wish that Kenko had done something similar because this is a very random collection of thoughts. There is no perceivable ordering or any organisation. I struggled with this initially because I like things to be categorised and structured. I don\u2019t like mess and books that are all over the place. Indeed, this edition could be read back to front or odd pages first and even numbered pages after. It could even be picked up in the middle. It is, quite literally, the idle and most random thoughts of the author. He ponders all manner of things in here. However, once I got over the lack of coherence in the writings, I did find some wisdom and perhaps even a kindred spirit.  \"It is a most wonderful comfort to sit alone beneath a lamp, book spread before you, and commune with someone from the past who you have never met\". I found myself agreeing with many of the author\u2019s opinions. He is easy to sympathise with and relate to. He was clearly man who appreciated his books, and understood the comfort and joy that can be found within the pages of a worthy tome. He\u2019s observations on how one should live their life are also quite accurate, at least in my opinion. He suggests that wealth should not be the measure of one\u2019s life because it disturbs peace and tranquillity; it only leads to a corrupt mind, and cause other\u2019s to lust over your treasure. I think in principle its sound advice, but not always in practice. Wealth can be accumulated and used benevolently, though that is quite rare. I just think at times, his thoughts sounded similar to my own. \"What happiness it is to sit in conversation with someone of like mind, warmed by candid discussion of the amusing and fleeting ways of the world\u2026\u2026but such a friend is hard to find, and instead you do your best to fit in with whatever the other is saying, feeling deeply alone.\" I feel like the author has made many true observations that will ring true in the heart of any bookworm. He understands because, by the sounds of things, he was one once too. I\u2019m very glad I read this, and I do recommend it to those that wish to, as Kenko put it, commune with someone from the past.\n3. The Yellow Wallpaper by Gilman\n-Penguin Little Black Classic- 42Here follows the diary of a moronic Victorian husband. >Three days before treatment: I\u2019ve got a great idea. My wife is suffering from low mood. So I, being an extremely practical Victorian man, have decided that the best solution for the problem is to restrain her in the house. This is  clearly  a brilliant idea. Our marriage simply doesn\u2019t restrain her faculties enough.It makes sense you see. I got the idea from the prestigious Dr. Silas Mitchell. He describing what he calls his \"rest cure\" for hysterical women, wrote, \"I do not permit the patient to sit up or to sew or write or read. The only action allowed is that needed to clean the teeth.\" At the end of six weeks to two months of such treatment, he says the women would be good as new. So I\u2019m going to try this on my wife. Can you not see the sheer intellect behind the idea? This will solve everything just you wait and see. >1 day into treatment:I\u2019ve restricted my wife\u2019s freedom incredibly. I direct her every action for her own safety. She eats what I tell her, when I tell her. And she has to stay in our bedroom all day. This will soon be over; she only has a temporary nervous depression. She babbles on to me about her problems at night. I don\u2019t have time for them. I\u2019m a man you see. So that means respectability and shutting down any sign of emotion. I told her to go to sleep, this will soon be over. >7 days into treatment:I caught my wife writing in a journal. What an impetuous woman she is! Does she not understand that these restrictions are for her own safety? I do this because I must have a trophy wife. In public we must be seen as a successful couple with an air of respectability. She can\u2019t be jotting down such nonsense and expressing her thoughts. I told her to stop. She doesn\u2019t need the distraction. She needs to be well again, for my sake. >14 days into treatment:My wife has taken a turn for the worse. She barely eats and she just sleeps all day. She says she needs a vocation; she needs something to do to pass the time, and test her intellects. What silly notions. What she  clearly needs is more restriction. That\u2019s the only way she will get over her aliment. She keeps talking about the wallpaper, says she wants the room decorated because it feel like a prison. She says it reminds her of bars. I cannot be doing with it, I told her to go to sleep. I\u2019ve got man things to do in the morning. >30 days into treatment:My wife has gone mad. I think she will have to be locked away. I entered the room and what I beheld was sheer depravity. Such animalistic behaviour, I passed out. I could not bear the sight. The treatment did not work. I should have restricted her more. She had far too much excitement, locked in the house all day with that extremely entertaining wallpaper. I should have left her in darkness. That would have worked. Note to self- Tell Dr. Silas Mitchell of this discovery. **************************************************************The truly scary thing about this story is how real it is. This is the rest cure Victorian women were subjected to, and the journal I wrote here is the ridiculous rationale that drove it. The author of this story was actually administered this \u201ccure.\u201d Her own experienced informed her narrator\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s terrible that something like this had to be written to show how stupid these ideas were. This is a very powerful story, and this was a very stupid husband.-I\u2019m glad I read through most of them, it\u2019s been fun at times but so many of them weren\u2019t to my taste. It was good to discover what I like though."}, {"userName": "Milen Kindekov", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26068868-milen-kindekov", "userReview": "#01 - Giovanni Boccaccio - Mrs Rosie and the Priest - ***** - (29 July, 2017) Review Here#02 - Gerard Manley Hopkins - As kingfishers catch fire- *** - (05 Aug, 2017) Review Here#03 - Anonymous - The Saga of Gunnlaug Serpent-tongue- **** - (30 Aug, 2017) Review Here#04 - Thomas de Quincey - On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts- **** - (25 Sep, 2017) Review Here#05 - Friedrich Nietzsche - Aphorisms on Love and Hate - *** - (30 Dec, 2017) Review Here#06 - John Ruskin - Traffic - *** - (21 Jan, 2018) Review Here#07 - Pu Songling - Wailing Ghosts - ** - (28 Jan, 2018) Review Here#08 - Jonathan Swift - A Modest Proposal - ** - (15 Feb, 2018) Review Here#09 - Wang Wei, Li Bai, Du Fu - Three Tang Dynasty Poets - * - (02 Feb, 2018) Review Here#10 - Walt Whitman - On the Beach at Night Alone - ***** - (01 Feb, 2018) Review Here"}, {"userName": "MissNYix", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51926621-missnyix", "userReview": "1.
