Here are a few things I learned: The Landscape: There are almost no conifer or evergreen trees in the middle ages so the winter skyline is particularly bleak.There are no grey squirrels, only red ones. The grey variety has yet to reach Britain. Cattle and sheep are smaller than their modern counterparts: much smaller.There are no wolves. The last English wolf was killed in North Lancashire in the 14th century.The People: Half of the entire population are under the age of 21 so everyone is inexperienced and immature. Imagine a nation being run by a bunch of hormonal teenage boys. People marry at age 14. Many commanders in the Army are still in their teens.A woman who is 30 years old is considered to be in the winter of her life. Women are blamed for all intellectual and moral weaknesses in society and are basically viewed as deformed men. The avg medieval person is considerably shorter than their counterparts of today, although nobility are about the same height as today. This disparity in height is due to genetic selection as well as difference in diet. The extra height gives a nobleman a considerable advantage in a fight.Speaking of fighting, it is not unusual to come across men who have lost eyes, ears and limbs in wars. A surprisingly large amount of men have to hobble around without a leg or with foot injuries that never healed correctly.Food: The main staple of food is bread & something called \"pottage\" a thick stew of oats or peas (green pottage) or leeks (white pottage) that has been boiled into a mush for several hours over a fire. If you have a garden, you will throw in some herbs, garlic and cabbage. Add left over bread crumbs as thickener and that's your daily meal when you are not eating plain bread.Most peasants have very few opportunities to eat meat, dairy or even fish. Pickled and salted herring is the only kind of fish they usually eat. If you have a well kept fruit orchard you are very lucky and can make preserves from apples, pears, berries, plums and grapes.A Medieval Street in York, EnglandThe Language:In 1300 the nobility speak French, not English! If you can't speak French, you can't command any respect. Only the lowly poor peons speak English. Nobody commissions any literature in English. Not until 1350 when King Edward the III, who speaks English, expresses pride in the English language, do aristocrats begin to speak English as well as French. Hygiene: People rarely bathed or did laundry but did wash their hands before each meal. A peasant usually had only one set of clothes.Health: In the Great Plague, 35%-45% of the entire population is wiped out in just 9 months. Thousands of villages are left empty. If you are lucky enough to avoid catching the plague, don't relax too much, leprosy or tuberculosis might still get you. If you do get sick, and are wealthy enough to pay a physician, he will not need to see you in person to treat you because diagnosis are based on astronomy. You will also be diagnosed by the color and smell of your urine and the taste of your blood.There is so much more in this book, but I can't tell you everything! Please read it! It's really good!"}, {"userName": "Orsolya", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya", "userReview": "Most of us who read history or historical fiction set in Medieval (or even Tudor) England, can agree on one thing: we can\u2019t understand the ways of life \u201cback then\u201d properly because we tend to apply modern morals and standards to history. However, with the \u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Guide to Medieval England\u201d, readers can finally understand Medieval times. I guarantee you will never look at a history book the same again\u2026Divided into main sections such as the landscape, people, medieval character, what to eat/drink, etc; Ian Mortimer dives deep into medieval life. His depth of information is staggering (but never boring or overwhelming) and allows the reader to fully understand medieval life which extends beyond knights and jousts. Consider it a \u2018Medieval Times 101\u2019 crash course, as Mortimer focuses on the macro view of life versus individual kings or events (although he does touch upon specifics) as we are used to reading. Although academic in topic, Mortimer\u2019s writing style is anything but; as it is easy to understand, descriptive, and witty.The Time Traveler\u2019s Guide cleared up so much information in my mind which has been swimming around from the countless history books I have figuratively consumed. The ranks of clergy, description of the privy seal (and other seals), and even \u201cfun\u201d factoids such as the inception of \u201cacres\u201d, the defining term \u201co\u2019clock\u201d, and even surnames (John Ilbertson used to be John, son of Ilbert) are included and explained in a clear and rational way. The reader truly feels like he or she is visiting the past (sort of like Scrooge with the Ghost of Christmas Past), observing life and almost being apart of it. Mortimer is rich, colorful, and very informative. There ARE some moments of overwhelming presentations, but that is due to the lack of standardization in England during that time and not due to Mortimer\u2019s writing style or expertise. My favorite realization? I FINALLY understood the differences between pennies, shillings, marks, and pounds. In the past, my eyes have always glazed over during money talks in other history books.One qualm was the constant references to Chaucer and \u201cThe Canterbury Tales\u201d. Although Mortimer used a medium amount of sources for the book; Chaucer is readily quoted and referred to. If Chaucer was a brand and this book was a TV show, it would scream, \u201cproduct placement\u201d. Also, the chapter regarding laws and court systems was confusing, but admittedly, I\u2019m not even interested in those topics in modern times so perhaps it just wasn\u2019t my cup of tea, personally. Overall, The Time Traveler\u2019s Guide to Medieval England is an absolutely terrific book: one of those works which you are sad to see end. The crux of it all is Mortimer\u2019s passion for history. There is no escaping it and it bleeds through his work. More importantly, he views history in a different manner than the average person passing this ardor onto the reader, who will never view history or Medieval England the same again. The Time Traveler\u2019s Guide to Medieval England should be used as the sourcebook for every subsequent medieval-themed historical fiction book, play, TV show, commercial, etc. Where was this book over 15 years ago when I was a school child partaking in our school\u2019s \u201cMedieval Faire\u201d? Perhaps, I should travel back into that time..."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "As a history book, this is an interesting format and it's reasonably engaging, though by the end I was starting to get worn down by the sheer level of detail. But what bothered me was that apparently, if you want to time travel, you'd better be male: there's some lip service paid to actually discussing women's role in society, with some references to the kind of work women did (mostly: make ale, I gather), and quite a lot of reference to the kind of clothes women wore, and how likely women were to be assaulted and raped, but. We hear about monks and not about nuns, about merchants and not about their wives, about farmers and not their daughters. And don't give me the excuse about that not being interesting to read about: nor is intricate detail about what a monk can eat on which days, for most people. In summary: to time travel, apparently you have to be male. And only men are interesting. Slightly disappointed I paid for this book right now."}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "It's nonfiction written like fiction, which made it super fascinating to read.

P. HartleyTake this book along on your next trip to Medieval England to help ensure your travel experience is a smooth one. Some things you might need to know for your journey:-- If you are from Australia, you might be impressed that even in the 1300s people have some vague concept of existence of the continent. However, you should keep in mind it's considered much too hot for man to inhabit, and instead is the home of creatures that hop around on a floppy, oversized foot that they use to shade themselves.-- Don't eat meat on Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday. The Church forbids it. Seafood is permitted, but good luck finding some outside the nobility. Water loving species like badgers and puffins count as seafood (but please don't eat puffins!).-- Hospitals are for the sick, but also travelers. If you stay there you might have the fun experience of sleeping in the same bed as someone with leprosy.-- Speaking of lepers, try not to come down with a rash of any sort in the 1300s or you might be declared one and forced to wear a bell around your neck (ask your cat about how this can damage your self esteem).-- You might notice more blind horses wondering around than you'd expect (which would probably be no blind horses at all). Blinding horses was the Medieval equivalent of scratching off vin numbers, meant to insure stolen beasts didn't make their way back home.This book is the slice-of-life history study I've been searching for. It's everything I'd hoped Ruth Goodwin's How To Be a Tudor would be but wasn't. I've never had a strong interest in Medieval times or English history, but that's not required to enjoy this fast paced and fun book. If I had one critique it would be to add more information about the Church and the Plague, both of which dominated 14th century life but were absent throughout most of the book. Highly recommended for history fans."}, {"userName": "Dannii Elle", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle", "userReview": "I have long found this period of history the most fascinating to read about. What compels my interest is not the fierce battles or matters of court, but more the running of the day-to-day life of the common people, during this time.For that reason, it was like this book was penned with my particular desires in mind. Unlike many other non-fiction books, this was not set out in the typical chronological format. Instead, this was split into sections that focused on one particular area of interest - such as clothing, food, and housing. Battles, the Black Plague, and other areas of historic interest were noted but little space was given over to dwelling on those subjects. This is more of an overview of how an average day would look like to an average citizen.I also adored how this book was penned, which fitted well with the structure of this book. With the minimum of dryness and a sprinkle of humour all information was relayed. It was neither sensational nor overly-academic, but instead a steady mixture of them both. As the title suggests, this book is written as if it were to be used as an actual guide for an actual future time-traveller, assisting them on how best to fit in if they were to return to an average day from this period of history. Average seems to be the word to best sum up this book's ultimate focus, but certainly not how I would describe how it delivered what many would perceive these rather banal facts."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/841949-tracey", "userReview": "Obviously, A Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England was a title calculated to gain my attention. The premise: a different take on presenting an overview of a period of time, using the format of a travel guide \u2013 something of a Fodor's England 1320 that might be found in the TARDIS. Exploring the experience of all the senses, this should be a gem of a resource to the writer of historical fiction or fantasy. From the introduction: We might eat differently, be taller, and live longer, and we might look at jousting as being unspeakably dangerous and not at all a sport, but we know what grief is, and what love, fear, pain, ambition, enmity, and hunger are. We should always remember that what we have in common with the past is just as important \u2013 real and essential to our lives as those things which make us different. Er. Almost lost me there. \"Be taller\" I can let pass with a chuckle \u2013 I'd probably fit right in, heightwise, in 1320, tall only amongst hobbits (oh: actually, I'd still be short \u2013 women average 5'2\") \u2013 but I strenuously object to the remarks about jousting. Dangerous? Yes, and so are auto racing and football. Not at all a sport? Pfft. Say that to  Justin Lewis or Justin Ray Thompson's face, I dare you. (And before anyone can chime in, yes I'm aware that the jousting of today bears about the same resemblance to 14th century joust as today's sword fighting resembles theirs. But it's still a sport.)\"W.H. Auden once suggested that to understand your own country, you need to have lived in at least two others. One can say something similar for periods of time. To understand your own century, you need to have come to terms with at least two others.\" I like it. If nothing else, one wonderful thing about looking at another time period in this sort of format is as in the introduction, the oft-repeated, but necessarily so, axiom that people never change. There are some shifts in perception and tolerance \u2013 bear- and bull-baiting are no longer remotely acceptable in much of the world, and the education of children no longer relies heavily on the rod, and it's no longer considered a hilarious lark to set a trap to string someone up by the ankle \u2026 but it's taken centuries to shift such things out of the norm into the abnormal, and the behaviors or the desires toward them do still linger. One point carried through this book is that, fundamentally, a medieval man or woman is not so very different from someone you'd meet on the street right now. (Particularly if \"right now\" you're walking down a path at a Renaissance Faire, but that's a whole 'nother post.)I rather enjoy how almost point for point this book contradicts A World Lit Only By Fire. As described there, the medieval period was dark (\"lit only by fire\") and filthy and pest-ridden, and the peasantry slogged their way through a short and grinding existence until they died of something which could probably be cured or prevented now. In which there is some truth, of course \u2013 but Ian Mortimer points out that a medieval man had no 21st-century standard by which to judge his own surroundings. If it was by our standards filthy, that only means our cleaning methods include chemicals, ready-made tools, and easily accessed fresh water; the average housewife did quite well with what she had. No one expected to live to see their nineties, and while the average day in the life might have been filled with drudgery, the sun shone just as bright as it does now, and it was also filled with laughter and song every chance there was. Otherwise, there were surprisingly few surprises here for a reader of a great many medieval-set books; whatever can be said of some, I have always had the greatest faith that Edith Pargeter's books could be relied on as largely accurate. But it is the handful of surprises, and the much more generous concentration of detail, that make this a terrific reference. How far can someone expect to travel on medieval roads, on foot or by horse or otherwise? It's in here. There is some excellent information here, entertainingly presented. I do wish some parts had been expanded, though. Sumptuary laws are touched on, the origins and some detail given \u2013 but I think if a time traveller had to rely purely on this book as regards to what he is and is not allowed to wear he might end up in trouble: color, for example, was dictated as well as material. A great many of the dictates were moot, as crimson velvet or any material dyed purple was too expensive for most, but on the off chance a time traveller missed this and transgressed he could be subject to fine. Another thing that surprised me was the failure to explain small surprising things \u2026 for example, the mention of a brown scarlet item of clothing. Apparently, I find after a little research, the word (from mid 13th century French) originally meant fine fabric, of whatever color: \"a kind of rich cloth\". (1200\u201350; Middle English < Old French escarlate < Medieval Latin scarlata, scarletum, perhaps < Arabic saqirl\u0101\u1e6d, siqill\u0101\u1e6d < Medieval Greek sigill\u00e1tos < Latin sigill\u0101tus decorated with patterns in relief; see sigillate). The author is very good about most such things, which makes this sort of omission strange. I am unreasonably delighted the licenses required to build castles or fortifications. James Bond can keep his license to kill \u2013 I want a license to crenelate. Also, in the section called \"Organized Crime\", suddenly Robin Hood comes up \u2026 and there came a tiny little light bulb over my head. Of course Robin Hood and his men were organized crime. As with the crenelating, I am insupportably tickled about this. On the whole, while this was a lovely idea, well-written and well-read, and very enjoyable, for me there just wasn't quite the depth of information I hoped for. This was a very nice overview, dipping down here and there for a closer look.

Want to know how to avoid prosecution for murder in case you slip up during your travels? Mortimer lets you know. Want to know what sports you can expect to enjoy? They're all here.

In other words, he places the reader in the moment, advising you where to go, what to see, how to behave, speak, dress and what to expect should you happen to have the good fortune to be transported back to not-so-merry old England in the 1300s. After my second reading of this book in less than a year, I wish I had access to Dr Who\u2019s Tardis because, with Mortimer\u2019s well-thumbed book under my arm, I would head straight for Exeter, where the book opens, prepared for the ordure of the aptly named, Shitbrook, the breath-taking sight of the cathedral, avert my eyes from the remains of criminals clinging to the gallows, and be careful not to stare at the bright and strange clothes the people are wearing, while tripping along the cobbles, one hand firmly on my money so a cut-purse does not take it. Like many contemporary historians, Mortimer believes in social history, reconstructing the past in order to understand how it was lived and not simply by kings, queens, monks, lawyers and nobles, those who have left records of their deeds and desires for us to absorb and through which we judge them. Instead, Mortimer turns to all classes and all experiences and takes the reader on a magnificent and fascinating journey back to a character-filled society with its own delights and dangers. It was so good the first time, I did it again and liked it even better. Explaining where to stay, how to tell the time, greet people (Eg. \u201cfellow or friend, ye be welcome\u201d), about the sumptuary laws, what certain coins look like and what you might be able to buy and where, what diseases we might succumb to if we\u2019re not careful, what we might be served and how to eat it whether it be in an inn, a peasant\u2019s house or a king\u2019s castle (all of which are thoroughly described as if you\u2019re on a guided tour), Mortimer runs the gamut of class and place in this vivid recreation that is at once hugely informative and always vastly entertaining. Even how to avoid running foul of the law and what punishment might be meted out is made clear as well as the significance of religious observances. Medieval humour is also explored as well as, for those so inclined, where you might find the best er hum, sexual services (Southwark, the Stews, in London, in case you wanted to know). He also discusses how to entertain ourselves while we\u2019re there (the Stews aside) and who, among the great figures known to us now, we might expect to encounter on our journey \u2013 Geoffrey Chaucer anyone? He has rooms above Aldgate. Just when you think you\u2019ve stepped back into the present, Mortimer will remind you to take a deep breath and stop. Listen, he advises. What do we hear? Very little. Maybe some bells, the sounds of birds and animals and, above all, the chatter and clutter of people should we be near a town or city. Or, if present at a joust, the thunder of hooves. The medieval world is a very quiet place, something I hadn\u2019t considered, along with many of the other preconceptions and yes, prejudices I had about this period and which Mortimer\u2019s grandest of tours manages to overturn. If you\u2019re looking for a book that will literally transport you to another time and place, than I cannot recommend this one highly enough.

History told in the form of a living guide - up close and personal. It's brilliant. Ian Mortimer shows us the food, the customs, the language, the clothes, the games, the laws, the risks, the illnesses, medicine, the poor, the aristocrats, the merchants, the soldiers, writers, poets, religion, the criminals, and so on. He also brings alive the sights, the smells, the landscape, cities, towns, markets and hamlets. Every few pages there are insightful facts and lightbulb moments that connect the 14th century to our lives in the early 21st century. The Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England: A Handbook for Visitors to the Fourteenth Century really brings the era to life. Take, for example, his section on the Black Death. You may already know that it wiped out a third of Europe's population (dwarfing the First World War) but until you walk through devastated communities watching rats and wild pigs eating corpses or see a man sobbing as he tells you he has buried five sons, I don't think you've probably fully got to grips with the implications of such extraordinary loss of life. The entire book is consistently vivid and instructive. Ian Mortimer uses the second person and the present tense throughout. So, you travel into the city or you sit down at a table, making it an effective technique for fully engaging the reader. This approach may not be for everyone but I found it compelling and involving. I notice Ian Mortimer has taken the same approach in two other books - The Time Traveller's Guide to Elizabethan England and The Time Traveller's Guide to Restoration Britain: Life in the Age of Samuel Pepys, Isaac Newton and The Great Fire of London.

As with the crenellating, I am insupportably tickled about this.On the whole, while this was a wonderful idea, well-written and well-read, and very enjoyable, for me there just wasn't quite the depth of information I hoped for. This was a very nice overview, dipping down here and there for a closer look. But I still love the idea of the Fodor's Medieval England; I'd love to see that. I listened to the Audible version, which despite a lovely reading by Jonathan Keeble probably didn't do justice to the book.

So, starting with this one I think was a good choice. It reads almost like a novel. The idea that you are a visitor to medieval England, discovering what life was like there from your own observations draws the reader/listener into that world immediately. I found it endlessly fascinating, discovering new things. The author imparts his knowledge on the subject with such a light touch that it is never dull, always entertaining, and sometimes amusing (medieval fashions were bonkers - would you want to wear a pair of shoes that made it impossible to walk upstairs in?). I liked that each subject was allocated its own short chapter, so that you could move on quickly if it really didn't interest you. There are many subjects included, ranging from fashion, food, health and illness, hygiene, hunting, travel, jobs, war, religion, royalty, crime and punishment (often arbitrary, swift and brutal) and much more.I wouldn't want to live in medieval England - the chances of dying of something now preventable or curable was immense. Life expectancy was not good, that is even if you managed to avoid getting the plague which was rife.A thoroughly enjoyable read, and a good informative book for anyone wanting to discover more about every day life in that era."}, {"userName": "Santhosh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7006637-santhosh", "userReview": "[~~ The people are basically of three 'estates': those who fight, those who pray, and those who work.~~ Humans, cattle, sheep are all smaller than their modern counterparts.~~ It's very quiet.

Mortimer takes a much more serious and adult stab at bringing life to a long dead world, and covers every detail you might be interested in, including personal hygiene, legal structure, meals, foliage, etc. He attempts (rather successfully, in my opinion), to convey historical reality to the reader without the aid of a contrived plot (a la historical fiction, which I also do appreciate).

Ian Mortimer couldn\u2019t be a more qualified source of information, as a member of the Royal Historical Society, and the recipient of their prestigeous Alexander Prize in 2004.What I love most about this book is the way it\u2019s written, as if you really were travelling back in time to the medieval period, with chapter headings like What to Wear, What to Eat and Drink, and most delightfully, What to Do.Under the chapter heading of Landscape, Mortimer discusses London in some detail, and includes a list of Ten Places to See in London. For example, Sight number 6 is The Strand. Apparently it affords the visiting time traveller, or just plain traveller, the best view of the river, and is were the most prestigious houses are located. Sight number 9 is Tyburn. It is THE PLACE to go if you want to see a good execution. Roll up, roll up, there is one nearly every day!But Mortimer understands the curious time traveller may want to leave the stench and refuse-filled ditches of London behind him or her, and wander throught the countryside, stopping at the small towns and villages they pass along the way. He offers plenty of insight and advise to those wishing to experience the bucolic delights of the medieval countryside.And if you\u2019re confused about who is who in the zoo when it comes to people, he gives the perplexed time traveller a nice little graph so you can see the social hierarchy at a glance. He also splits things up helpfully into those who work, those who fight, the clergy and then, of course, women. I found his information on how women were treated, discriminated against and how that situation was almost impossible to reverse because of the social order and conditions of the time very interesting.He also gives an extremely interesting chapter on the character of the medieval person. How they thought, what their perceptions of the outside world and each other were. He also gives some handy information on the price of goods, and wages and salaries.This is the kind of history text I love. Social history at its best, well-written, often amusing, and yet backed with a great deal of research. If you\u2019re writing about the medieval period, and medieval England in particular, I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "John Brown", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2240923-john-brown", "userReview": "I love learning new things about places and peoples, even if it\u2019s a place I\u2019ve \u201cbeen\u201d to before, which is why Ian Mortimer\u2019s The Time Traveler\u2019s Guide to Medieval England intrigued me. The first page convinced me to buy to book. And I\u2019m so happy I did.I\u2019ve read my fair share of interesting and well-written texts on this subject, including, among others, Life in a Medieval City and Life in a Medieval Village by Frances and Joseph Gies, Standards of Living in the later Middle Ages by Christopher Dyer, The Medieval Castle by Philip Warner, Daily Life in the Middle Ages by Paul B. Newman, and Power and Profit: The Merchant In Medieval Europe by Peter Spufford. All engrossing reads. What sets Mortimer\u2019s book apart is that he not only approaches the topic as a travel guide that leads to you interesting sights and shares fascinating tidbits about the place, but he also helps you imagine how it would be, as a 21st century person, to actually travel there.For example, where would you go if you got sick? What happens if you\u2019re robbed, where do you report the crime, and should you? Where might you get food and would it be something you\u2019d find palatable? How will you get from place to place? Why kind of entertainment can you expect? And what can you wear without offending your hosts?Mortimer focuses on the fourteenth century England, since this period comes closest to the popular idea of the medieval times. He tackles the topics of the landscape, people, the Medieval character, basic essentials, what to wear, traveling, where to stay, what to eat and drink, health and hygiene, the law, and what to do. And he does it all in a chatty, clear, and informative manner, with a bit of humor thrown in for spice.Each page was a delight, and I found myself feeling like I was there. Furthermore, I learned a number of things that I hadn\u2019t picked up in my previous readings.

For anyone who loves historical fiction as much as I do, discovering new insights into the past is just as entertaining as a good story. The Time Traveler\u2019s Guide to Medieval England has much to offer.We learn the life expectancy is much shorter in the 14th century. Throw in the Plague, and you have half of the population under 21 years of age.When you consider that societies with youthful populations are more violent, tend to be supportive of slavery, and see nothing wrong with holding brutal combats in which men fight to the death for the sake of entertainment, you realize that society has changed fundamentally.The book goes on to describe the types of people who live in the 14th century, the class system, the work, and how they conduct their economy. I found of particular interest the clothing, as advances technology allowed for buttons and different fabrics, (not to mention foreign trade, which introduced fashions from abroad) which changed the clothing dramatically. From a loose tunic in the early century, clothing styles changed greatly to be more form-fitting, with shorter hemlines for the men.No wonder monastic chroniclers feel obliged to pass comment; they blame the men for displaying very short skirts and well-packed hose, and they blame the women for being delighted by what they see.It certainly gives credence to the saying \u201cwhat goes around, comes around,\u201d doesn\u2019t it?Other chapters in the book cover subjects such as traveling, where to stay, and what people eat and drink in that era. Imagine you are a weary traveler, and need to find an inn for the night. Mortimer lets you know that if you are not on horseback, you don\u2019t stand a chance of getting a room. If you have a horse, and are lucky enough to secure a room, you will find several beds in each room, and you will share your bed with one or more persons.And don\u2019t get me started on health, hygiene and medicine. Let\u2019s just say that if the disease doesn\u2019t kill you, the remedies of dung beetles, crickets and bats heads aren\u2019t likely to make things any better. Can a person die from being overly grossed out? I\u2019m sure that would have happened to me had I been subjected to 14th century medical practices.There\u2019s much more, but I\u2019ll leave that for you to read yourself.

For instance, we see how people lived in the 1300s, what their houses were like, and what they did for a living.We learn about the large fields that were unfenced and un-walled and how livestock often wandered over the crops.Individual families had about an acre that they were responsible for tending, so when this happened it was quite \u201can embarrassment.\u201dThe forests covered about 7% of the English countryside back in the 1300s and there was hardly any loose timber or branches lying on the ground.People gathered it up and used it for kindling or building. Large oaks were prized for their ability to cross long spans with a single beam. The Great Plague of 1348-9 devastated these people. In 1300 there were about 5 million people in England but in 1400 there were only 2.5 million. England wouldn\u2019t get u to 5 million people again until the 1630s.I especially liked the chapter on wages. You see huge pay discrepancies between the various classes, and even within them.For instance, earls got paid about \u00a31,000 a year from their estates. Barons made between \u00a3300 and \u00a3700 while knights make about \u00a340 and the local gentry maybe \u00a35 to \u00a340. Bishops make as much as earls while carpenters make about 3 pennies a day, or a little more than a shilling a week. That means it takes them about 4 months to make \u00a31.

I loved it in spite of the bias, as the style and the accounts of everyday life are so incredibly vivid and well-written. The only thing I had qualms with were his presentation of matters of gender, as his accounts on the gender politics of the time may be accurate, but the way he presents his data it is rather annoying, especially when he starts going into detail about why he believes that men were also oppressed at the time.

Ich habe jetzt aber wirklich Lust, eines der fiktionalen Werke des Autors zu lesen, denn seine Kenntnisse \u00fcber das Mittelalter (in Gro\u00dfbritannien) und die Lebensweise der Menschen damals sind absolut beeindruckend.Das Besondere an diesem Buch ist, dass es nicht nur trocken Fakten berichtet, sondern tats\u00e4chlich versucht, dem modernen Leser die Denkweise und Mentalit\u00e4t der mittelalterlichen Bev\u00f6lkerung nahezubringen.
