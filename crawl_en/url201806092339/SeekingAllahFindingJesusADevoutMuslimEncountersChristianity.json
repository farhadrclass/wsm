He raised all the same arguments that i've seen presented by Muslims on chat groups and in video's. And he deals with all the truthful answers Christians clearly show.I was so looking forward to what finally pushed him over the edge and allowed him to leave Islam. But the driving issue was eventually Muhammad and the Quran itself. The challenge is that muslims are so afraid to carefully critique their culture and belief they will fight in ignorance to the bitter end. To be fair - I would do this for Jesus and the Bible as well. The solution is to find a way to get Islam to clearly show its true colors. There is tons of scholarly information showing the violence and sexual abuse in Muhammad's life and the Quran...but getting any Muslim to see this is a miracle. They have to desire truth more than they cling to their Islamic culture and families. If I left Christianity I would not lose my parents or friends or job - So I really cannot imagine what all is at stake in following the Jesus of the Bible. But as the author shows: Your very soul is depending on Jesus being your savior and GOD.I can't wait to see what else this author writes in the future."}, {"userName": "Rebekah Rodda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4123340-rebekah-rodda", "userReview": "Nabeel died yesterday so I am sharing my review again in honour of his memory. Sometimes you read a book and love it so much you want everyone you know to read it too! This is that book. It is so good I did not want it to end. I loved the friendship between Nabeel and David - their playful banter but also their ability to discuss controversial faith matters in depth while still remaining best friends. David's ability to question Nabeel while still being a fun and awesome friend is a real challenge to me. How do I share the gospel with my friends who have their own religion? How do I speak of real matters of faith and the heart in a way that shows my genuine love and concern? Nabeel's story shows the importance of being willing to engage people in theological matters, something I tend to shy away from focussing instead on my personal experiences with my loving Creator. This book has encouraged me to reconsider my approach. 'Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus' is also excellent in explaining Muslim beliefs and practices as well as in showing the evidence for Christianity. I feel like telling every Christian I know to read this book. Your own understanding of your faith will be richer and you will also walk away realising why some Muslims do genuinely believe Islam is a peaceful religion (and why some don't). Thank you Nabeel for being so courageous in your pursuit of truth whatever the cost."}, {"userName": "Natalie Vellacott", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34178791-natalie-vellacott", "userReview": "I was a bit dubious about this book due to the references to supernatural dreams and visions that the publisher has splashed everywhere obviously for the purposes of sales. However, I was pleasantly surprised; the supernatural aspects are not the focus of the book, instead the focus is a close friendship developed by the Muslim author with a Christian school friend over a number of years. This (in conjunction with the Spirit of God) ultimately led to his conversion from Islam to Christianity.His account is compelling and very readable; I found it hard to put down. He explains his upbringing in a strict Muslim family, his parents being his role model, and his faith his life. He explains his Islamic beliefs and practice and the difference between the Eastern 'shame' culture and the Western right and wrong/black and white. He provides good examples of how conflicts easily arise in the hearts of Muslims when they are asked to challenge the hierarchy/their elders. They are taught to obey/believe without question from a young age even when their intellect is telling them that something is suspect. The author details how they would rather ignore the facts than risk shaming the family. This he explains at length by documenting his own emotional turmoil when he begins to be challenged by Christianity.  Of course, like all people, Muslims in the East and West generally just believe what they are taught. Rarely is there much critical investigation into historical events, and the few that invest the effort usually do the same thing I had done: attempt to defend what is already believed, potentially ignoring or underestimating evidence that points to the contrary. This is only natural, since it is extremely difficult to change beliefs that are dear to the heart.His friendship with David, a Christian friend, develops due to both of them having a sincere faith albeit in a different God. They stand apart from the US culture which is pretty worldly. The author has reproduced the many discussions they had and the questions that arose in a lot of detail. He read numerous books during this period and it's clear that his search for the truth was sincere. He began his research intent on converting David to Islam or at least proving that Christianity was unreliable. He failed and became more and more aware of this as time went by. He has a strange experience where he asks God (it is not clear which God he is addressing) to reveal the location of his friends in a large gathering and 'God' sends him a sign in the sky directing him to his friends. I'm not sure what to make of this but it doesn't move him much further forward faith wise.His first visit to a Christian worship service didn't assist him in his search for the truth either and we would do well to hear and reflect on his comments;I had never seen any of this before, and it all seemed very irreverent to me. Worship was supposed to be a solemn, reflective time of bonding between man and God, yet these people were banging on drums and asking for money. At the mosque, no one was allowed to stand in front of you while you worshiped so that you could focus on worshiping God. That there were girls on stage during a worship service seemed to border on sacrilege. So the worship service disturbed me and left a sour taste in my mouth. I thought, 'If this is what it means to worship God as a Christian. I want nothing to do with it.'However, David, his friend, was walking the talk and this was undeniable.Effective evangelism requires relationships. There are very few exceptionsI'm not sure I totally agree with the above statement as there are circumstances where the Holy Spirit has prepared the heart of a person and people are individuals and respond in different ways. But I definitely think that relationships are often key in evangelism amongst Muslims as it's necessary to negate the negative image they have of Christianity based on Western culture. This is best done through building friendships and demonstrating a sincere Christian faith on a daily basis and over a period of time.The author eventually came to the point where he knew the truth but couldn't embrace it wholeheartedly due to his ingrained beliefs about Islam and his fears about hurting those he loved and possibly being ex-communicated or worse. It was at this point that he began begging God for dreams, having previously begged Allah with no reply;I would reach a point in my life when I spent many prostrate hours begging Allah for guidance through dreams. And as it turned out. When I got one, I knew it was from Him.Dreams are the only means I know of by which the average Muslim expects to hear directly from God.I wasn't sure what to make of this. The author claims that God sent him three dreams and that he knew after the first one that there would be two more. His first dream was somewhat bizarre involving various creatures and people. The meaning wasn't clear so he asked his Muslim mother to look up all the symbols/creatures in her 'dream book.' He then uses her response to interpret his dream. He does the same with the next two dreams although these seem to have a clearer message; 'leave Islam, convert to Christianity.' I'm not convinced that God would have us use a Muslim's dream book to interpret dreams that He has sent.....However, I don't believe these dreams detract from his story as it is clear to me that he would have converted without the dreams. Maybe God was gracious to him knowing how hard it was due to his family situation....Leaving aside the supernatural encounters that I'm not sure what to make of. This is a great book for a Christian to use for evangelism. It covers many of the common arguments that Muslims have in relation to the Bible and other crucial aspects of the Christian faith. It also reveals a surprising level of ignorance of Muslims about their own faith due to their cultural hierarchy. We can learn from this and ensure we are patient when seeking to evangelise and not unnecessarily offending our Muslim friends.I recommend this book for Christian readers with a heart for evangelism...Read Tim Challies review here..."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "First let me say up front that this is the personal story of a young man who left Islam and became a Christian. That's for those who are concerned. The account is given with respect and love. There are no attacks here only a first hand account of a journey that was not easy and was (and probably still is) often painful.Allow me also to say I recommend this for Christians in \"the West\", that is those of us who live where Christianity is the most common \"religion\". We are often not conscious of the sufferings of our brothers and sisters in the East as persecution of Christians has become prevalent (and has been prevalent) there. This young man had to put his entire life \"on the altar\" so to speak. All he was, all he believed...his family all for God.Yes I recommend this one. 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Trent", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2038023-trent", "userReview": "I've been a Christian all my life. This year I set aside 11 months to travel the world and live in over 11 different countries. Each country has provided a different lens in which to view myself, my faith and my home (America). But in months when I was living in Muslim countries I had a hard time understanding their culture and practices. Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus has proved to shift my perspective and understanding of what it is like to convert to a new faith, especially one as deeply rooted as Islam. Until now, my perspective on Islam was one given by Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC. Now my eyes have been opened and a newfound compassion has been born for Muslim people. Regardless of what one may think about this book, I hope all can see it as a new conversation starter on the similarities and differences between Christianity and Islam."}, {"userName": "Raymond Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/252458-raymond-christopher", "userReview": "If there is a book, that challenges an Islam faith to the root, without trying to hiding its strong points but also without compromising the weak cases.If there is a book, that shows how bias a human being can be; no matter how knowledgeable and wise he/she is; when fierce questions are aimed towards his/her belief.If there is a book, other than the Bible itself, that boldly strengthens a Christian faith both academically and emotionally.This book embodies these expressions. And more.If you are a non-believer (of Christianity, in this sense), this book will help you to think critically (I mean it) about your own belief and not just holding on to a blind or lazy faith.If you are a Moslem, you will be stimulated on re-discussing everything that you believe and not believe about Muhammad and Jesus, Quran and Bible.If you a believer; especially for those having shakings in their faith; you will be reminded on how God can transform one's life miraculously and why God is more important than anything in your life, even your family or work.Me personally ? I was on the latter category, and my soul just got crushed after reading this; as if I re-embrace my first love to God.Not to mention this book is easy-to-read, as it's wrapped up in set of flowing yet thought-provoking, life stories.No matter which position you stand, after reading this book, you can't just ignore what Nabeel Qureshi shared with his life experience.

The ironic thing is that even though the author's faith in Islam was shaken because of contradictions in the Quran and inhumane treatment of people ( e.g. men allowed to rape women captured in war, beheading men and children), he could of used his same grievances against Islam for the Bible, especially in the Old Testament. The author conveniently spent most of his time in the New Testament, seemingly missing the point that the God in the Old Testament (who had men, women, and children of entire civilizations killed without mercy) is the same God in the New Testament. Not to mention that the New Testament predicts that God will kill everyone in hellfire who doesn't believe in Him (\"the wicked\"), women and children included. When the author, referring to how the the Quran mercilessly destroyed families by killing the men and boys while selling the women into slavery, said, \"What if that happened to me and my family?\", I thought that he could of used the exact same reasoning in the Old Testament where similar things happened repeatedly when the nation of Israel, under the command of God and Moses, mercilessly destroyed entire civilizations and even \"took women for themselves\" who were captured. Of course it is easier to make the Bible seem slightly more peaceful than the Quran when you ignore the Old Testament of the Bible and the ultimate fiery doom of the world that the New Testament predicts.Furthermore, there are numerous contradictions in the entire Bible too. The author seems to be oblivious to all of this and doesn't answer a single one of the alleged contradictions. And then there was a weird part of the book where the author has a conversation with one of his best Christian friends, David, and receives an eyebrow-raising statement. Starting on page 130:\"Alright, David, I've been looking into textual criticism some more, and I've found problems.\"\"What do you have?\"\"Looks like I was right about whole sections of the Bible being interpolations. Bible scholars are saying that the end of Mark is not original, and neither the story in John about the woman caught in adultery. You know, the story where Jesus says, 'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?\"\"Yeah, I know the story. YOU'RE RIGHT, THEY'RE NOT ORIGINAL TO THE TEXT. WHAT'S YOUR POINT? [capitalization added for emphasis]\"Later on, David makes an even weirder statement about parts of the New Testament Bible. Starting on page 132:\"And I told you, VIRTUALLY NO SCHOLAR CONSIDERS THOSE SEGMENTS AS PARTS OF THE BIBLE ANYMORE [capitalization added for emphasis]. You need to show me a major change in something we actually consider a part of the Bible.\"David made these weird statements about the end of Mark, an entire story in John, and the part of first John that talks about the Trinity (Father, Word, and Spirit are one). Who would believe any part of the Bible to be true if it has made-up stories in it? This is when I began to realize that David was not the normal Christian who took the entire Bible to be \"the Word of God\". In fact, no where does David or any other Christian in this book attest to the Bible being the \"Word of God\". They make the Bible to just be a collection of manuscripts compiled by men over time that may have interpolations (additions) added to them. Hence the reason David believes entire parts of the Bible are basically fabricated. The author had every reason to be shocked as much as I was shocked at this attitude David and seemingly other learned Christians had towards the Bible.Next, when it came down to answering the author's questions about Christianity at these religious panels someone had at their house where learned Christians would gather with people from other religions, the Christians would say something like, \"Most scholars agree that Jesus rose again. It's a universal fact\". What am I supposed to do with that? If I don't want to seem stupid I must agree with these learned scholars about the resurrection of Christ? And then they brought up some vague account about how a coin was found somewhere in the Middle East that backed up the New Testament's claim that a certain ruler was in power. So what? What does that have to do with the power the Bible professes to have? There was no cold hard facts that these learned Christians could bring forth about the resurrection of Christ being real besides \"most scholars agree that it happened\". They relied on the opinion and beliefs of others to back up their beliefs.In the end, it was not the striking truth of the Bible and its power that pushed the author over the edge away from Islam into Christianity, it was three obscure dreams, two of which required a Muslim textbook to interpret ironically. So what's the message of this book? If you want to be a Christian, the Bible is not enough, you need supernatural events and dreams happening to you in order to make you believe without a doubt that God and the Bible are true.The author could of made this book three times more interesting if he gave more detail as to how his relationships with his Muslim friends and family changed. He spent a great deal in the beginning detailing Muslim culture and tradition, but in the end as he was moving away from Islam into Christianity, he spent no time letting the reader know how his relationships with his Muslim family was changing. He finally gives a scant account at the end of the book about how it changed after he accepted Christianity, but I wanted more detailed conversations instead of a single sentence between his mom and dad. What exactly were their objections to his new faith as he tried to explain it to them in a way a Muslim would understand? I also wanted to know what was life like as a Christian as opposed to being a Muslim. Another opportunity for gold lost. Pick this book up prepared to learn interesting things you didn't know about Islam, not to be swayed by any Biblical truth."}, {"userName": "Craig Cottongim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16736509-craig-cottongim", "userReview": "Aided by an impressive cohort of mentors and legendary Christian Apologists, Qureshi brings to print a very valuable book, showing step by long step his transition from being an active Muslim to accepting Christ. Rarely do I put all other reading materials on hold to focus on one book at a time. Normally I'm reading at least six books simultaneously, but when I began reading Nabeel's narrative, I devoted myself to reading his story straight through. Written like a memoir, \"Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus\" illustrates the Biblical truth that those who have eyes to see, will see. This book is nearly 300 pages long, but I read through it in just three or four sittings -- it was that captivating. Written with the utmost respect for his Islamic heritage, Qureshi sets out his journey of faith from being fully immersed in the Muslim world of his youth, through his long emotional trek to embracing the Christian faith. The grandchild of Muslim missionaries, Qureshi was brought up in a loving home where the Quran was revered and his parents professed their undying allegiance to Allah and his prophet, Muhammad. Nabeel's story is engaging for several reasons. For starters, we read about his admirable upbringing in a very devout Islamic setting; he is raised in an idyllic loving home where he gives insight into the mysterious world of Islam. Most Westerners have no idea what happens within the subculture of transplanted Muslims (Qureshi's family moved to the US from Pakistan) and this glimpse into Nabeel's world is captivating. I found myself more than once infatuated with his homelife as a youth; their devotion to prayer and congregational life was seriously impressive. Secondly, this book is so mesmerizing, because Nabeel is transparent about his wrestling match seeking the truth of Who God is. It's not easy to ask God, \"Who are you?\" and then to go through the process of analyzing all that you've been taught to believe. This book is fitting for several audience: For Muslims seeking to know the truth about the Identity of the True God, for those interested in reaching Muslims, for people who are simply interested in learning more about Islam, for those in the pulpit who would like to address this topic more intelligently in a post 9/11 world, and though it is not a textbook, it would serve well in a Seminary classroom too. I add this last part based on my Seminary experience; I learned more about Islamic culture and the Muslim faith in Qureshi's book than in an entire semester of Communicating Cross-Culturally with Muslims.One of the real gems in this book is the masterful way Qureshi weaves in Islamic terms into the narrative, and then in the margins, with shaded text-boxes he unpacks these unfamiliar terms. The terms are all categorized in a helpful Glossary at the end of the book, for further study. Without employing a dry lecture or boring you with factoids, Qureshi teaches you several key terms throughout the story. It is a very clever and interesting way to impart the knowledge of the intricacies of the Muslim world without making the reader feel like they are working hard to learn new words.Towards the end of the book, once God breaks down all the barriers in his heart and mind, Qureshi experiences one vision and a few dreams from God. I wish Qureshi had elaborated more on the dreams that helped confirm God was guiding him to become a Christian. He goes into detail recording the content of the dreams, but I felt since these dreams were the capstone to his years of researching both faiths, and his impassioned debates along the way, more coverage of this supernatural intervention on God's part would've helped enrich this wonderful book.It's hard not to conclude after reading this book that Christianity has too much fragmentation and petty infighting, and see how this book inadvertently highlights the fact we have bigger issues to address than our personal preferences. We need to look past our denominational squabbles and see there is a field white for the harvest. A major lesson I took away from reading this book is that no one is too far gone or beyond the reach of the Gospel. We can never look at a person who is indoctrinated in another religion (even a Muslim) and think, they won't respond to the message of Jesus. Also, this book reminds us, key relationships are essential in leading someone to Christ. Qureshi had seeds that were planted and watered by some incredible people who were close to him, who loved him, and who were willing to invest in a long-term commitment. I wouldn't be surprised to see this story one day picked up and adapted for the Big Screen. Filled with anticipation, it is a moving narrative with an incredible character arc that has all of the tension, conflict and suspense that makes all stories great. We are indebted to Qureshi for sharing his path from the Crescent to the Cross. May we all be sensitive to the great cost he and other Muslims make, who by turning to Jesus leave loved-ones feeling betrayed and abandoned."}, {"userName": "Erick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31567333-erick", "userReview": "I actually read this book some time ago. I don't list every book I read, that's why it isn't on here. Due to an interaction I had with a person who reviewed this book and was on my friends list, I feel compelled to write my own review. I think most people know the background of Nabeel Qureshi's conversion, but I will give it quickly. Nabeel was brought up in an Ahmadiyya Muslim American home and was a devoted follower of this religion. When he entered college he met a man named David Wood (a devoted Christian) and they became friends. They regularly debated about each person's respective faith and this began as a debate on Christianity, which David was able to make a convincing case for, and they proceeded to debate Islam, which Nabeel couldn't make a good case for. The problem for Nabeel is that he had not read much of the Hadith. The Hadith shows the background of the Suras. That background itself became hard to justify when it became known; at the same time, Nabeel felt the pull of God through the teachings of the Bible. He still remained on the fence for a while though. After a few dreams he had had, he was convinced that God was leading him to become a Christian. This book details in wonderful fashion the struggles Nabeel had. Sadly, Nabeel passed away recently, but this book stands as a great testimony. I also want to comment not on the Islamic reaction that Nabeel received, but the negative Christian reaction. You would think that Christians of any denomination would praise God that Nabeel converted, but that just isn't the case. He received much criticism from fundamentalist Christians who really have nothing better to do than search out every book and teaching that doesn't align with their highly biased and humanly dogmatic take on scripture. It's not surprising that most of the denominations that spill out heresy hunters in droves are Calvinist in background. They carry all the same Pharisaical zeal as a John Calvin standing over the burning body of Michael Servetus. It's hard to hide my frustration over these people. They can quote the Bible, but the one thing they really don't have is Christian compassion. You can see it in some reviews on here and hit pieces by groups like Pulpit and Pen. What usually is at issue is the fact that Nabeel's ultimate decision to convert was due to dreams he had had. As far as these heresy hunters are concerned, God never guides people like that. All I can say is that I am glad God has never had to ask their permission to give me a dream. The ego and pride of these people is what they will have to answer for eventually. David Wood's testimony is really just as powerful as Nabeel's. He was not only an incredibly violent person before his conversion (he attempted to bludgeon his father to death), he was also diagnosed with a psychopathic disorder prior to his conversion. He has a youtube channel called Acts17Apologetics. I watch it regularly. I encourage people to do likewise. I really encourage people to watch the video of his conversion. He uses Plato's allegory of the cave in a Christian context, which I absolutely love. God will keep using people regardless of the so-called \"Christian\" obstacles that stand in the way. There were Pharisees that were obstacles in Jesus' day, and they will continue to exist until the judgment."}, {"userName": "Julie Davis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2125014-julie-davis", "userReview": "This is the book I'd recommend to any Christian who wants to understand how Muslims view Christianity (and Christians) and how they embrace and love their own faith. At least you'll better understand Westernized Muslims, which is the author's background.Growing up between Great Britain and America, Nabeel Qureshi never fit in with Western culture because of his Islamic heritage. When Qureshi meets David, a devout Christian, he finally has a friend who is more like him than anyone else because their faith is such a core element of their lives.Qureshi soon begins trying to convert David to Islam because he is sharing the greatest gift he knows, true knowledge of God. However, he gets a surprise when the arguments that previously planted doubt in Christians all fall apart when raised with a Christian who knows his faith well. In the process Qureshi carefully explains \"what every Muslim knows\" about Islam so that we understand his reasoning. This provided insights into the Muslim understanding of faith and God. What became really interesting was watching when Christian friends began asking about Muhammad and the Quran. We know from the title where this book will end so as it progressed I became increasingly apprehensive, just as Qureshi was, for what a decision to become Christian would do to his loving parents. I really loved the window this book provided into a loving Muslim family and this was one of the most gripping parts of the book. There is an emphasis in this book on history, source materials, and reliability of testimony which I am used to seeing applied to Christianity but which becomes riveting when seeing it applied to Islam. I also appreciated the way that Qureshi was careful to explain the differences between what Westernized Muslims teach versus Eastern Muslims. That in itself was an education and helped me see why some explanations of Islamic behavior (peaceful versus ISIS, for example) are so contradictory.Eye opening, inspirational, and definitely recommended."}, {"userName": "Ian Hammond", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9023834-ian-hammond", "userReview": "Woah."}, {"userName": "Justin Tyme", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7581380-justin-tyme", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone interested in a Christian-Muslim debate.

As a child and youth, he enthusiastically learned the facts and doctrines of his religion, eager to be an ambassador for Islam among his peers. Not until college did he meet a Christian who was willing to be his friend. As two young men passionate about their faiths, Nabeel and David often discussed religion. Through those discussions, Nabeel found his perception of Christianity and its flaws to be inaccurate. And in his efforts to disprove Christianity and confirm Islam, he also uncovers inaccuracies in his perception of Islam.When a friend recommended this book to me, I anticipated a story about conversion and ensuing persecution. Because it was recommended by someone I trust, I never read the synopsis to correct my expectation before reading. Instead of Nabeel's conversion occurring near the beginning of the book, it concludes it. Instead, Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus predominately offers Christians a sympathetic, inside look at an everyday Islam that rarely gains news coverage--a religion truly believed to be a religion of peace and truth by its followers.A missionary who sometimes visits my church likes to say, \"Muslims are not the enemy. Our battle is not with flesh and blood.\" This book humanizes that flesh and blood. It gives an honest perspective on what many Muslims believe as well as the cracks in the foundation that many are not aware of. It shows how genuine, persistent friendship can have eternal rewards.

Over 100 people have already rated this recent publication and 95% of them rated it as a 5/5. I found that rating improbably high, so when the opportunity to read this book for myself arose, I happily accepted.Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus is a story of a man's journey from Islam to Christianity. Qureshi was raised in a devout Pakistani Muslim family where Islam was absolutely central to what they did and how they lived. Qureshi's parents were well-versed in the teachings and practices of Islam and they were devoted to passing these teachings and practices on to their children. In this book, the author provided an autobiographical account of his life beginning in Islam and his journey to Christianity. There is much to like about this book. Qureshi wrote respectfully about Islam. In fact, I learned more about Islam from this book than I have in other things that I have previously read or encountered. He was able to provide a first hand, insider's account of what Islam actually looks like and teaches. He did some without animus or antagonism. The author also treated us to his wrestling with the truth of Christianity and the difficulties with Islam. Through a four year period, he engaged in challenging and difficult conversations with people he came to trust, most notably his friend David, who figures prominently in the book. Qureshi is no intellectual slouch, finishing college in the top 1% a year early and then graduating from medical school. He applied his fine tuned intellect to exploring both faiths in depth. Most importantly, though, I think this book provides a window into what apologetics and evangelism look like in the context of real relationships. So many apologetics books are antiseptic, but real life is gritty and there are real consequences to changing worldview. Qureshi dealt with those changes and shares with his readers the joys and the pains associated with that. Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus is a remarkable book.

I love how Nabell Qureshi came to Jesus through facts and research; it was not an emotional spur of the moment decision. You knew while reading the book, if he did come to believe it would be a life altering decision, one that could cost him his family.I admit I was not familiar to what Muslims believe and this book pointed out certain ideas that are just difficult for them grasp..for example the trinity. Trinity is hard for anyone to grasp, but for a Muslim it was nearly impossible. Also gave me a glimpse how Muslim children were raised by their parents. I love the life time friendship and commitment David Wood had with Nabeel, may we as Christians be in it for the long haul with some of our friendships. I love how David never shied away from Nabeel's questions and was loving in responding to Nabeel's questions and disbelief.Like I said I believe this is book all Christians should read."}, {"userName": "Robin Hatcher", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3932631-robin-hatcher", "userReview": "I learned so much from reading this book.

(If you don\u2019t want to read my review just go get the book & read it, it\u2019s great. You won\u2019t regret it)Nabeel was born the eldest son of Pakistani immigrants, growing up in America & the U.K.\u2014wherever the U.S. Navy assigned his father. His parents were devout Muslims & wherever they went, they attached themselves to a mosque & to the local Islamic community.In college Nabeel began to grapple with the claims of Christianity that countered his Islamic faith. He grappled with the authority & reliability of the Bible verses the authority & reliability of the Koran; he grappled with salvation by faith in Jesus Christ verses salvation by accruing good deeds; he grappled with the deity of Jesus Christ verses the prophecies of Mohammad.Eventually, through years of debates & through deep soul-searching, Qureshi began to doubt everything he had ever believed about Islam.Through this book Nabeel gives an insider\u2019s perspective of the Muslim mindset. This is important as I fear that many Christians today may give in to the stereotypical portrayal that all Muslims are terrorists; thus making no real effort to get to know them, care for them much less share their life & the Gospel with them. The insight Nabeel sheds on the Muslim religion, culture, & the importance apologetics played in preparing him to truly see & trust in Jesus Christ, is both educational & uplifting.In the introduction to his book, Qureshi notes he wrote it with the following three purposes in mind:\u2022\tTo tear down walls by giving non-Muslim readers an insider\u2019s perspective into a Muslim\u2019s heart and mind\u2022\tTo equip readers with facts and knowledge, showing the strength of the case for the gospel in contrast with the case for Islam\u2022\tTo portray the immense inner struggle of Muslims grappling with the gospel, including their sacrifices and doubtsQureshi accomplishes these goals powerfully. He explains the Islamic mindset, something anyone who witnesses or wants to witness to Muslims must understand if he or she hopes to be an effective apologist. By taking the reader through his own process of conversion, step by step, he outlines the arguments that were most convincing to him.I simply cannot recommend this book highly enough, it really is a must read."}, {"userName": "Tariq Mahmood", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2006699-tariq-mahmood", "userReview": "Every one of us needs friends, but I guess some need them more than others. Looks like Nabeel is suffers from a chronic need of being culturally accepted. This overwhelming urge of belonging prompted Nabeel to convert rather than attraction towards Christianity. Would Nabeel have converted if he had remained in a secular UK instead of a very christian USA? Our brain accepts what the eyes see and our eye looks for whatever our brain wants.The story is filled with comparisons with flippant events which are easily contradicted. Like the insurance story for example. Nabeel's has presented the story as evidence of the difference in the two religious based cultures of Pakistan and USA, but it could be easily due to the fact that the insurance system is not as prevalent in Pakistan than USA, thereby making it difficult for Pakistanis to understand its intricacies. Yes of course Islam has a large influence in Pakistan but the culture is evolving there as well. if Nabeel wants to date, he might be surprised how easy it is to date in Pakistan now. The story had little interest for me as most of the issues like the changing of Quran and Hadith are already public knowledge. So there has been changes, but Christianity has had far greater changes. rationally would I stick with a few changes or go with a religion which has made greater changes?I think my issue is that I don't understand people changing religions, when you can easily become a skeptic.

This book is an absolutely riveting account of the life of a Muslim apologist, and his conversion to Christianity. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about Islam, and especially for Christians who want to learn how to reach their Muslim friends and neighbors. I would also recommend it to Muslims who are interested in learning about Christianity, and why one Muslim was convinced to forsake the religion of his parents, whom he dearly loves, and put his faith in Christ.Since the publication of this book, the author has been diagnosed with Stage 4 stomach cancer, and is undergoing treatment as of this writing. I have been following his vlog on YouTube, and continue to be impressed by the humility and faith he exhibits in the face of such an overwhelming trial. I'm praying for his healing, but mindful of the words of Paul, that Christ can be glorified in our bodies, \"whether by life or by death\" (Phil. 1:20).Because of descriptions of atrocities committed by Muslim soldiers (which I skipped), graphic details regarding crucifixion, and other mature themes, I would recommend this only for adults, or mature teens."}, {"userName": "Valerie Kyriosity", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3123581-valerie-kyriosity", "userReview": "Very good. I will never be an apologist -- can't keep that much of that sort of information in my head and find the right bits to pull out when they're needed -- but I appreciate that gift all the more in seeing it applied. I also deeply appreciated David's faithful, patient friendship with Nabeel. He did not pressure Nabeel into a decision, which might have pushed him away from Christ instead of toward Him. This was friendship evangelism at its best, apologetics aptly practiced, and faithful perseverance that didn't attempt to wrest the process out of God's control. The mix of orderly reason and crazy dreams and visions was interesting and the insights into Islam and the Muslim mindset was very helpful. Nabeel's real suffering at causing grief to his family was affecting. Although he was spared any violent reprisals, his conversion was, like Rosaria Butterfield's, a personal trainwreck.The book was excellently read by the author.

I was only about a quarter of the way through when I realized how wonderful of a book this was, and that I wanted to share and experience it with my husband. So I asked Travis if he'd want to listen to it with me, that way we could discuss it too. He started and finished it in just two days (sometimes driving a lot for work has it's perks). He really enjoyed it as well and over the course of the last few days, we've had some great and meaningful discussions! Last night as we were driving home from visiting friends, we got to talking about the book again, bringing up various parts that were awe-inspiring, motivating and/or faith building. I shared with Travis how inspired and challenged I was by David, one of the main players in the narrative. I don't want to say much and spoil it, but he really exemplified two powerful traits of a strong Christian: he 'studied to show himself approved,' and followed the promptings of the Holy Spirit.I definitely recommend this book! Nabeel shares a raw and wonderful testimony, and David's example stands as both a challenge and aspiration to every Christian. And if you decide to listen to the audio, it's read by Nabeel himself. Just last night I learned that Nabeel died of cancer last year. In this book, he left a beautiful and thorough testimony and one I pray his parents and sister will read and embrace too."}, {"userName": "Suzannah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13906136-suzannah", "userReview": "Really, REALLY good. Packed full of apologetic tools and invaluable insights into Islamic culture and worldview (eg the honour/shame culture), this book was most valuable to me as a glimpse inside the life and worldview of a sincere Muslim on his way to finding Christ. It was eye-opening to me to discover how things I had taken for granted Muslims knew about their own religion - like the compilation of a single quran and the suppression of all other versions under the Caliph Uthman, or some of Muhammad's more questionable actions - could be unknown to a sincere and lifelong Muslim.It also explained how there can be sincere Muslims who hold pacifistic beliefs, as well as, um, ISIS.A wonderful, absorbing, eye-opening book - a tool that will help you to be kind and understanding of Muslims even as you witness to them.

Of course some of the references could have been interpreted wrongly by him but some other are just too clear to be misinterpreted and requires to be looked upon objectively and sincerely by any muslim.

Nabeel's story starts in his warm, loving and joyful childhood home where his parents brought him up steeped in the traditions of Ahmadis Islam. Nabeel, a second generation American Muslim, starts his journey of faith in an earnest effort to proselytize Islam and win people over for Allah. In his mission, he meets a devout Christian who challenges him in his faith, setting him on a path to systematically analyze the historical texts, the early testimonies of eye witnesses and more to prove (or disprove) a case for Christianity, and then for Islam. Adamant that Islam is the only way and that Jesus was a only a prophet and a man, as the Quran says, Nabeel honestly and passionately starts down a path that leads him ultimately to Jesus, the Son of God.I found Nabeel's book to be a thoroughly captivating and equally convicting testimony to the power of God and the intensity with which He draws us to Him, through love. Through Nabeel's eyes I learned of the fellowship, worship and beliefs of Muslims and that Islam is a diverse religion, with deep differences between different sects and how they interpret the Quran. Before I read this book, I knew a little about Islam, but Nabeel's story paints an intimate portrait of the heart and life of a Muslim devout to Allah that piqued my curiosity and taught me much about a faith that billions the world over follow. More than that, Nabeel told his story of what happens when a Muslim meets Jesus Christ and turns from Allah to follow Jesus in such detail - I felt that I was there with him. In his efforts and research, Nabeel built a case for Christianity that could not be denied and found that he could not replicate his findings in his research for the case of Islam.What I found very surprising was how convicted I was by Nabeel's story. The questions that he would put to Christians to test their faith in his efforts to proselytize them for Islam had me searching my Bible for answers. Could I have answered his questions with certainty, accuracy and conviction? Could I point him to answers in the Bible and thoroughly defend my faith? Nabeel's story has renewed a heartfelt conviction to get into deeper Bible study and know more about the faith that I profess and love.I recommend this book for anyone who has ever searched and asked questions of their religion - be in Christianity, Islam or another. Nabeel asked questions, did the research and followed their conclusions to the undeniable answer. More than that, his love for God was so passionate, so complete, that he risked losing everything - family, friends, community - to choose God first.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com  book review bloggers program.

He's very analytical and goes in a lot of depth when describing what he believed as a Muslim and the questions that arose when he was trying to disprove Christianity. He goes through each argument one by one, and this was incredibly helpful to me to learn more about Islam.What I really loved about this book was that Qureshi's humility and love emanated from his words. He clearly loves his family and others of Muslim faith and has not taken on a superior, preachy attitude which is very prevalent among western Christians. There was a really good balance of analytical examination of faith and personal stories of his family and friends. The writing itself was incredibly fluid!I would recommend this book to all Christians, especially those who want to know more about relating to Muslims. I really enjoyed hearing about Nabeel's friendship with David, and was struck by how long the process was before Nabeel finally surrendered his life to Jesus Christ.\"Effective evangelism requires relationships. There are very few exceptions.\" (p 120) I originally received an e-copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley but ended up listening to the audiobook instead and I'm so glad I did!

The testimony of Qureshi was exactly what I needed. A very logical and thorough study of both Islam and Christianity. It challenged my own foundation of faith as a preacher! Throughout the book I found myself hoping that he would look at his faith objectively, find holes in his belief system, and turn to Christ! But then I had to wonder, would my own hold on my faith hold up to such scrutiny. I know it would, but the better question is, am I ready to defend it at that level? It was a joy to follow this journey, and was especially thrilling to hear the author read the audio book. Of course the Arabic statements rolled off his tongue naturally, adding a delightful flare of authenticity to the story.I highly recommend this book to those who would seek to understand Islam, but also for those who may need to just kick the tires of their own faith."}, {"userName": "Michael Jones", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6236139-michael-jones", "userReview": "This is the best book I found on understanding Islam from the perspective of an insider.
