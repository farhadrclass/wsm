In this artfully-bound book she includes three short stories and 100 pieces in flash fiction form. Of the three longer pieces \"Madmen\" stood out the most. It explores a society in which when girls get their periods, they adopt an insane person to stay with them for the rest of their lives. This piece highlights Corin at her best, when she nails the authentic and vulnerable voice of an anxious thirteen-year-old, all while driving home an important and non-didactic message about mental health in contemporary times.Her 100 vignettes also carry a a more sporadic strength. While some move into the realm of hyper-intellectualism or self-awareness-turned-dramatic, for the most part they offer a slew of thoughtful themes ranging from the psychological repercussions of imminent death to our intrinsic desire for sheer connection when times get rough. Even though Corin may lack consistency in the quality of her writing in this piece, she still offers much wit, in the form of sometimes shocking and revelatory near-death moments."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "\"Like any reasonable apocalypse, pulsing with intimacy and the anonymous.\"Well I do love a good apocalypse treatment, and this is unique in the handling of the topic. It isn't really a story, but a set of a few longer stories and then a bunch (a hundred, I'm guessing) of smaller little blurb stories, flash fiction really, all in this universe of collapse and destruction. There are fun bits to enjoy and one in particular (\"Questions in Significantly Smaller Font\") sent me on a huge internet rabbit hole, it was more of a poem quoting entirely from the FAQ of the website raptureready.com... which seems to be a real thing, in fact I saw a church yesterday in the mountains of NC that had a \"rapture ready\" banner up. And hey, the church was empty, so you can decide what that means.This book was previously published by McSweeney's so even though I have a review copy, I believe it to be final copy. Mea culpa if I should not be quoting from it.\"This is why we lived twitching, as if we'd ever sense what could help us.\" (from Vibrissae)\"Despite everything, after the apocalypse there are hardly any suicides, no matter what we've done or failed to do. I suppose our minds assure us we can handle it. I mean God only gives you... I mean God only lets you do what you can live with after the apocalypse.

There were times I did not know what end was up in the many worlds she created and I was grateful for the disturbance. She does not tell stories like anyone else I know.

Some of the apocalypses make up the best English sudden fiction I've come across. As Louise Gluck blurbs, \"Corin sounds like no one;\" her prose is uncanny, in the way Freud used the word: fundamentally strange: it's uncanniness aestheticized somehow. Anxious, graceful, frustrated, violent, flippant, cracked-out at times, you're not sure what to do with it, maybe I should laugh, maybe I should reread that line, maybe I should just shut up and careen through and just listen. Flits between hyperintellectualism and pop colloquialism midsentence like DFW, only less inviting. And she's cold, there's the analytical coldness you get with Robbe-Grillet. The fact that I want to reach for these big names to compare/define her work says something, I think, but the point is, it moved me, I'm just not sure how, and I'll definitely attempt anything she writes in future, hoping for more of a balance between style (already masterful) and content/story (jury's out)."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1635175-paul", "userReview": "Apocalypses come in sizes large and small in the title sequence of 100 vignettes and prose poems that never fail to move the reader.

Secondly, there are over a hundred short stories about the apocalypse--what could go wrong? Well, actually, a whole lot could go wrong, but it doesn't, and that is my point. The theme doesn't get tiresome, although I will admit to not having always read through the book in chronological order, but rather by the rules of bibliomancy, through the touch of divination--and I will probably continue to pick the book up, close my eyes, flip through pages and land where my gut says, \"Stop,\" and then re-read whatever story has presented itself. The stories themselves are diverse, textured, and often quite unique.

Where they occur, and when, what caused the apocalypses \u2013even what an apocalypse is (some are sold from under raincoats, others crawl about or enter the body) \u2013 all remain carefully undefined. In \u201cA Hundred Apocalypses\u201d, a collection-within-a-collection uniting a series of thematically linked pieces, there are stories as short as ten words. The contexts of place and character shrink to nearly nothing. Such \u201cflash fiction\u201d sections are apocalyptic only by association; in themselves they are aphorisms, recollections, or anecdotes. Taken as a whole, \u201cA Hundred Apocalypses\u201d implies a vision of the strange as inextricable from the commonplace: when a band plays a concert for the few people to have survived one apocalypse, the narrator\u2019s concern is with dodging the price of the ticket; a man attending an unruly exhibition of computer-controlled holograms is bumped and loses his glasses. Even in the wasteland, we are unable to escape the small irritations and confusions that make us human. Although less obvious, this is another link between Apocalypses and Isle of Youth: both use genre conventions \u2013 albeit from extremely different genres \u2013 to investigate the familial, the emotional, and the personal. In \u201cMadmen\u201d, when the narrator experiences her first period, the time has come to visit the pound-like centre where the mad are kept and choose one. In the battle of wills that ensues between the narrator and her mother, the issue of what is being chosen is hardly important; what matters is the sensitivity with which Corin explores the family dynamic."}, {"userName": "n", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23905242-n", "userReview": "There are moments in this book that felt utterly compelling & on point; but they were not, collectively, enough to save this collection of short stories for me.

In the midst of a recession, international tensions, and environmental crises, it is clear why we might be obsessing over how it all ends. But this interpretation forgets that interest in the end is nothing new, and that it has its roots in more immediate and primary concerns. The question of the apocalypse is, perhaps first and foremost, a question about death: in 1 Corinthians, Paul writes that \u201cthe form of this world is passing away,\u201d words that resonate whether read as a claim about Jesus\u2019 return or about the condition of mortality. Perhaps even more fundamentally, the question of the apocalypse is a question about nothingness, which Heidegger saw as fundamental to human existence. In One Hundred Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses, Lucy Corin takes on the subject with imagination, subtlety, and wit, in visions of the apocalypse that press us to rethink the word\u2019s very bounds.As its title suggests, the collection\u2019s core is a series of one hundred short pieces, ranging between a sentence and a few pages in length. Divided into four epigraph-bearing quarters, each apocalypse vividly treats some fleeting moment, a burst of action or reflection. Many center on what we might call \u201can actual apocalypse\u201d \u2014 a scenario involving chaos, destruction, and the end of the world. But many others avoid this territory, and the thematic coherence of the series shows the unhelpfulness of a dichotomy between \u201cactual\u201d and \u201cfigurative\u201d apocalypses. Though divergent in style as well as subject, the pieces share a strange undercurrent. They all are truly of a kind, though just what that kind boils down to is elusive. Teeming with death, sex, and wonder, these hundred apocalypses press us to ask: What is an apocalypse, and what does it mean?Read more here: http://www.full-stop.net/2013/11/07/r..."}, {"userName": "Keith Rosson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8079673-keith-rosson", "userReview": "Three short stories and then the titular piece, which is a reasonably lengthy collection of (a hundred, assumedly, though I didn't count them) vignettes loosely related to the notions of an apocalypse, worldly, personal or otherwise. I'm torn on this one - had the book kept the same momentum and velocity and mastery of language and dread and flat-out beauty of the first three stories, I'd be lauding this book everywhere I went and buying copies for everyone I know. They're that good; Corin's voice is beautiful and assured and nimble as hell, and the stories are suffused with a kind of slow-burn magical realism that propels the narrative rather than overwhelms it. Just amazing work. Unfortunately, the vignettes that followed were frequently so obtuse and moored in abstraction that I had a hell of a time getting a handle on what was actually being said. So I just went along for the ride, still mesmerized by her use of language itself, but it was definitely a different experience than the joy of reading the narrative-driven stories in the beginning. So, yeah. Still a hell of a lot to admire here, but - for me at least - short of untouchable."}, {"userName": "Jeff Scott", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/321314-jeff-scott", "userReview": "Lucy Corbin\u2019s collection of short stories is filled with lyrical, metaphorical, and mostly nonsensical apocalypses. There are four short stories in the work, but in the last story there are one hundred mini-stories.

It\u2019s more of a\u201dthe end of the world (as we know it)\u201d kind of feeling. It\u2019s poetic in this way as narrative start and stop with irregularity. It reminded me of the book 420 Characters by Lou Beach. The last story gets a little tedious at times. At one point, she even wonders in a story how many stories she can come up with. I preferred the longer pieces in the collection, particularly Madmen and Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster. They both seem to be perfect themes for her concept. The way to deal with the madness and nonsense in this world is to have your very own mad man. What is left if you\u2019ve pinned your hopes and dreams on something that has just been destroyed?

The story really stayed with me.Eyes of Dogs was a retelling of a fairytale that honestly gave me nightmares, which I think is telling of a brilliant short story.However when I finished these longer short stories and got into the paragraph long snapshots of apocalypses I lost interest in the book.I am not sure if this is because of how stressed I am due to school or I just generally couldn't find any humanity in these episodic stories but it was a real struggle to finish the book.I'd highly recommend anyone read the longer stories, I think they are valuable and extremely well crafted.

That adjective describes everything in this book, I suppose, but I thought \"Madmen\" was particularly so, and the entire book is worth buying and reading even if just for that story. A young girl has her first period and now must go with her parents and pick out her personal madman from the available madmen (and madwomen!) options. It's a story about fraught mother/daughter relationships, straining against boundaries, the looming specter of inherited mental disorders, and the complicated way an androcentric culture treats young women, their periods, their bodies, their choices, and their minds. But first and foremost: it's funny, weird, and moving. As I read this I kept thinking of the Gilman's short story \"The Yellow Wallpaper.\" Not that the two have much in common aside from a feminist telling of women and madness, but I couldn't help but feel that \"Madmen\" is a similarly important work and should be considered both a top-tier example of the short story genre as well as a major entry into the field of feminist literature."}, {"userName": "Cheryl Klein", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416689-cheryl-klein", "userReview": "What is an apocalypse but plot--a thing that happens that we are left to react to.

The first few stories in the collection are longer and more traditional, if you can call Aimee Bender/Kelly Link weirdness traditional. I gobbled them happily.

I recognized them, in a detached way, as good writing, but found myself putting the book down for long periods of time. Not my thing. Then they became a bit more my thing.

An apocalypse might come in the form of the end of a relationship or the end of the world, but what it exposes is the tricky landscape of our longing for a clean slate.Three longer stories are equally visionary: in \"Eyes of Dogs,\" a soldier returns from war and encounters a witch who may in fact be his mother; \"Madmen\" describes an America where children who reach adolescence choose the madman who will accompany them into adulthood; in \"Godzilla versus the Smog Monster,\u201d a teenager is flustered by his older, wilder neighbor while California burns on the other side of the continent.At once mournful and explosively energetic, One Hundred Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses makes manifest the troubled conscience of an uneasy time", "title": "One Hundred Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16073074-one-hundred-apocalypses-and-other-apocalypses", "average": 3.59, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366073327l/16073074.jpg", "reviews": 65, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/535433.Lucy_Corin", "name": "Lucy Corin"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16073074-one-hundred-apocalypses-and-other-apocalypses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18668174-one-hundred-apocalypses-and-other-apocalypses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1080834.Everyday_Psychokillers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1352663.The_Entire_Predicament", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20514612-godzilla-versus-the-smog-monster", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16004270-american-short-fiction-vol-13-issue-48", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30314872-three-small-apocalypses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
