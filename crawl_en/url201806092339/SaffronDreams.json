Expecting their first child, they are happy with life. But on the morning of September 11, 2001, Faizan would go to work in the World Trade Center...and never return. Always free to live as a Muslim in America, after the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Great American Melting Pot doesn't seem to blend so well. People who greeted Arissa with a smile before that fateful day, barely look at her. Feeling adrift after her loss, Arissa wanders through the days awaiting the birth of her unborn son, a son Faizan would never hold. The discovery of her husband's unfinished manuscript may be the key to her survival. And perhaps by finishing Faizan's legacy, Arissa will redeem a race.If ever there was a book more eloquently written than \"Saffron Dreams\", I would like to see it. The words simply fly off the page and float into your consciousness; their power touching you in a way like no other book might ever touch you again. The struggles of being a 9/11 widow and a Muslim come together in a moving story that will find you filled with every emotion ever experienced by a human being. Abdullah's masterful storytelling draws you in from the very first moment and does not release you until you've turned the very last page. Anyone who has ever loved and lost will be touched by this heartrending, yet triumphant story of one woman's difficult journey to pick up the pieces of her shattered life in a country that has suddenly put her and an entire race under a microscope in order to make sense of a monumental tragedy. The descriptions and details put you right alongside Arissa so that you are totally captivated by her world, her dreams, her struggles, and her triumphs. The stunning cover art must be seen up close, as it is even lovelier and more striking in your hands than what you see posted here.\"Saffron Dreams\" is destined to add more awards to Abdullah's portfolio. This is a must read book for 2009!"}, {"userName": "Niki Sorensen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2369830-niki-sorensen", "userReview": "Wow, where do I start? Saffron Dreams is an endearing love story, and yet so much more. I fell in love with the characters. I couldn't help it. Shaila M. Abdullah portrays their courtship in a uniquely romantic way. How they express their love and desire for each other is tender, humorous, and very sensual.I enjoyed learning about Muslim culture. Diversity is an extradordinary gift we have been given on Earth. This book gracefully delves in to several important issues. For instance, after 9/11, Arrisa says \"Don't they know that terror has no religion? That religions don't treat terror?\" And further, \"I looked on day after day as the media tried, sentenced and hung my faith ... what proof did I have of the innocence of the rest of us?\" This book felt so real to me, I wondered if I was reading fiction, or if it was a true story. Another favorite quote: \"What would we do without our loved ones? They drive us over the edge and yet bring sanity to our lives.\"My favorite quote: \"Go home and take a long, hard look at yourself in the mirror,\" ... \"You will be pleasantly surprised. Our flaws are what make us unique. Yours make you beautiful.\"I'm going to have my daughters read Saffron Dreams. In this book they will subtly learn some life lessons that are beautifully written by Shaila M.

She moves to New York when she marries Faizan who works in a restaurant in the World Trade Center. Arissa is very happy with her life, her husband and their future prospects. Also, she is 2 months pregnant. On 11th September 2001, with the attack on the world Trade Center, her whole world came crashing down along with the towers. Faizan is dead and the last rituals are performed without a body, her baby is deformed in her womb and will probably never live a full life. Arissa\u2019s friends and in-laws help her move on. But she is alone and scared, scared of living her life without a companion and scared to raise a child with disabilities.As Arissa is managing to live life each day, she is confronted with another dilemma, her religion. After 9/11, the way Muslims were viewed changed drastically. The horror of Terrorism reached people who never thought something like this would happen to them. The targets were the innocent Muslims. As Arissa tells someone,\u201cWhen you put all your potatoes in a sack, you should know they all have unique flavors. Some are rotten, some fresh. Just because they are clumped together doesn\u2019t make then all the same.\u201d\u2026\u201cThey are not my people, but I don\u2019t think you are smart enough to figure that out.\u201dSaffron Dreams is a journey of a young widow away from her homeland and in a country she has adopted. It\u2019s a delicate subject and a book that handles a lot of sensitive issues without wanting to create a sensation. The writing was so raw and honest that I could feel Arissa\u2019s pain seeping through the pages.I did struggle through this book as I found it a little difficult to read, I even had tears in my eyes a couple of times, but the author\u2019s simplistic and crisp writing style and Arissa\u2019s struggle to find some hope in her chaotic life kept me reading and rooting for her. In the end, this book is not about 9/11, her husbands death, her child\u2019s disabilities or even her religion. It\u2019s about what binds us together even though we are from different homelands and different cultural backgrounds, which I believe is the crux of this book. Though not easy, it\u2019s definitely something that deserves to be read.Here are some of my favorite passages:Why was there no fear in my heart? Probably because there was no more room in my heart for terror. When horror comes face-to-face with you and causes a loved one\u2019s death, fear leaves your heart. In it\u2019s place, merciful God places pain. Throbbing, pulsating, oozing pus, a wound that stays fresh and raw no matter how carefully you treat it. How can you be afraid when you have no one to be fearful for? The safety of your loved ones is what breads fear in your heart. They are the weak links in your life. Unraveled from them, you are fearless. You can dangle by a thread, hang from the rooftop. Bungee jump, skydive, walk a pole, hold your hand over the flame of a candle. Burnt, scalded, crashed, lost, dead, the only loss would be to your own self. Certain things you are not allowed to say or do. Defiant as I am, I say and do them anyway.How do you end a story that\u2019s not yours? Add another sentence where there is a pause? Infiltrate the story with a comma when really there should have been a period? Punctuate with an exclamation point where a period would have sufficed? What if you kill something breathing and breathe into something the author wanted to eliminate? How do you get inside the mind of a person who isn\u2019t there?

Arissa's story is painful, fascinating, and doubtless the story of many many Muslims living in NYC who lost loved ones and saw their religion and cultures hijacked. While that is the historic backdrop, the gripping story is Arissa's personal tale of her loving in-laws who come frm Pakistan to nurture her back to health, who live with her for six years and assist in the day-to-day care of her special needs son. Probably the most uplifting incident in the book (and, ironically, there are several) is the exchange that occurs when Arissa collects her injured son Raian from school one day and is quietly fuming to herself as she drives him home, contemplating removing him from the school that would allow him to be injured, so clearly isn't equipped to meet his needs, etc. etc. Raian is gesturing frantically to his mother who must pull the car over to figure out what he is saying. He is so excited to tell her that they learned about Beethoven in school that day and, like himself, Beethoven was deaf and couldn't hear his own compositions. Somehow this remarkable little boy has found inspiration in Beethoven's story and innocently asks his mother whether he, too, might become a great musician. After their exchange, during which Arissa assures her son that he can be anything he wants to, she tells her readers, \"We rode the rest of the way quietly. The school was all right for now, I decided\" (p. 188). My point here is that Arisaa's highs and lows are so realistic, and the joy, solace, and perfection that she finds in her fragile son is what allows her to rebuild a life and move on. The characters in the novel are well developed, the cultural insights are much-needed in a society far too prone to black-and-white generalizations about Islam, and the healing power of art (Arissa is a painter who decides to tackle completing her dead husband's aptly-named unfinished novel, Soul Searcher) is well demonstrated here. This was a wonderful book, and you feel that you might have grown a little bit as you watch Arissa's tremendous journey toward an uncertain future that we share with her."}, {"userName": "Angela Simmons", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2485036-angela-simmons", "userReview": "Writer, Shaila Abdullah, takes you into the life of Arissa Illahi, a Muslim, born into the upper class struggling to find who she is.

It's about the strength of women and relationships. It's about the experience of women left behind in the 9/ll Twin Towers/World Trade Center terrorist attack. And, it's about the Muslim woman's experience in America.Ms Abdullah has a big order to fill on her proverbial plate, and she comes shining through like a bird of paradise! I loved this book for so many reasons, it will be difficult to convey them to you, so you'll ultimately just have to read this book for yourself to understand.The main character, Arissa, is a young woman who was born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan. After having survived a home of material wealth and non-existent maternal love, Arissa becomes the bride in a traditional \"arranged marriage.\" Surprisingly, this marriage is to a young man she had previously met on a trip to New York visiting relatives! So, fortune seemed to be with them. On the flip side of that fortune, however, rests a bad omen flung at them by a seer woman who predicts that the young husband will dance with fire. Arissa and Faizan also have dreams of flames and smoke, but set these things aside and ignore them.We learn along the way such interesting information about Muslim life in the everyday workings of the kitchen cookery, the ritual of the veils the women wear, the landscape and gardens of Pakistan, and the role saffron plays in the life of Arissa. I will never look at or smell Night Blooming Jasmine in quite the same way again.Ms Abdullah knows grief and heartbreak. Her novel tells us truly the pain of loss and the redemptive qualities that keep one living despite the agony of pain and loss. I was widowed at a young age with young children so I speak from experience, when I say that this book conveys the feelings and experiences I had so profoundly and gently that it was shocking.I learned that women and widows are the same no matter what their religion or culture. I learned that not all Muslims are terrorists. That children can save you. That family can hold you up but can't save you. And that somebody else unknown to you can have the same experiences and live to tell about it. Please do yourself a favor and read this wonderful book.

It depicts a veiled Middle Eastern woman with sad eyes shielding her face with her bejewelled arms. How appropriate for this novel about a Pakistani-Muslim woman who loses her husband to the tragic collapse of the World Trade Center.I love novels that are of the multi-cultural genre. And this book is filled with the flavours and traditions of the Middle East. Abdullah\u2019s writing is lyrical and poetic, with a sad tone that permeates this story told from the first person point of view of the main character Arissa Illahi. With flashbacks, we come to learn of her childhood and marriage to Faizan, the husband she knew for barely two years. She is pregnant when he dies and her pain is compounded with the knowledge that her unborn baby will have multiple birth defects.The whole story is Arissa\u2019s struggle with losses\u2014her mother\u2019s lack of love throughout her childhood, her husband\u2019s death and his unfinished novel, her child\u2019s disabilities, the age-old traditions of her former country, and her lost dreams. Through her eyes we see what she endures as a Muslim woman in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks\u2014the prejudices, the hatred, the misunderstandings, and her guilt for not wanting to return to Pakistan when Faizan wished it.Throughout, she voices her frustration and philosophy about death and God. It was clear to me that although she believed in God, she lacked faith in Him and struggled with this, too. Arissa also makes it her project to finish Faizan\u2019s novel, no easy task, even though she is an artist and a writer herself. She keeps her husband alive in her heart and fulfills his dream, making it a lasting legacy.Although this novel received great reviews, I had mixed feelings about it. Overall, it gave me a glimpse into the life of an immigrant Muslim widow in America, mourning her many losses and the decisions she made to cope with them. Sometimes, I had to put the book down and read something else because the sombreness of it was all encompassing. Besides her painful losses, it saddened me that her Muslim faith did not provide comfort or answers regarding death and tragedies. This book also contained mildly explicit sexual scenes and unmarried sex, which I did not expect from a Muslim author."}, {"userName": "Jaime H", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/761550-jaime-h", "userReview": "Arissa Illahi is a wife, a mother, a daughter, a sister, Pakistani, American, and Muslim.

It is the story of Arissa Ilahi, a Pakistani girl who deals with the shocking loss of her husband on the morning of 9/11. Arissa's character, (although unconventionally modern for a Muslim girl raised in Pakistan) is so real, I felt as though she was a close friend suffering through pain of great intensity. Volumes of books have been written about losing the love of one's life, but this is so articulately written, it feels much more like a memoir than fiction. Some readers have questioned this style of writing, oscillating between the present and flashback, but I actually found it uniquely absorbing, and it worked very well for me. The way she allows her thoughts to drift into different parts of her past, not only brings reality to her grief, but also brings an occasional smile to the reader's lips despite the tragedy engraved in the story, as the blissful moments are recounted. The marriage was heavenly, but it wasn't perfect, inundated with arguments between husband and wife, which made it all the more believable.Being a Pakistani Muslim in America myself, the 9/11 tragedy and its aftermath has had a profound effect on me, and I really admire Shaila's portrayal of those sentiments that terror has no religion. The challenges she faces raising her special needs child without his father is heartbreaking and well depicted. The selflessness of her mother-in-law is truly inspiring.Shaila has used language that has the soft and abstract quality of poetry, while preserving the clarity of prose.It is the kind of book that is not only hard to put down, but one that stays with you after you have done so. After reading Saffron Dreams, I will be more grateful to have the blessings which one tends to take for granted:the companionship of my husband, and the health and well-being of my two-year old son."}, {"userName": "Eileen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/945127-eileen", "userReview": "Shaila Abdullah\u2019s novel, SAFFRON DREAMS, is a tale of how one woman, Arissa Illahi, literally rises from the ashes of the September 11th tragedy to remake her life.

How will I explain the viciousness of the world and define hatred to a person struggling with so many physical challenges? How do you convey horror, contradictions, and terror? Perhaps I will instead steer him toward tales of the land we left behind, the country that shaped us and made his father the great man that he was. I might also tell him that when you leave a land behind, you don\u2019t shift loyalties \u2013 you just expand your heart and fit two lands in. You love them equally.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Ellen Black", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2001979-ellen-black", "userReview": "Saffron Dreams is a beautiful story about a young Pakistani woman who is both an artist and a writer and considered the \"ugly\" of three daughters. She's not looking for love and is surprised to find that a man she meets in the New York Public Library startles her with emotion while she's on a trip to the United States. Upon returning to Pakistan, a matchmaker shows the young woman and her father pictures of two available men and one happens to be the young man from the library. The couple marry and move to the states, living in Brooklyn. The husband, who is also a writer, takes a job working at Windows of the World, the restaurant atop one of the Twin Towers, and the wife writes freelance business articles and paints. When the husband is killed on 9/11, the wife faces a new journey, finding herself pregnant with a child who will be born with multiple birth defects and having to find her way in a new world, as a new kind of woman.The story is haunting and sad and beautiful and rich and loving and fascinating. Through my editor, I've been lucky enough to meet (via email) Shaila (pronounced Shella) Abdullah, the author of Saffron Dreams. Shaila is a beautiful soul, filled with love and beauty and talent and wonder and spirit and soul. Not only do I recommend Saffron Dreams, but also pick up Shaila's short-story collection, Behind the Cayenne Wall. I've read two of the stories in this book, and they, too, are rich with emotion and quite haunting."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5320415-melanie", "userReview": "Saffron Dreams is an insightful look at how to find strength and faith in the midst of loss and devastation. While reading this book I was taught the perspective of a woman whose world was flipped on it side - and whose support system dwindled because of prejudice and fear. The author, Shaila, was able to take me on an emotional roller coaster with her main character, Arissa, who - while dealing with the loss of her husband in the attack on the World Trade Center, must also learn to raise a special needs child in a society that now views her as a threat. This book offers a poignant view into the life of a fiercely independent Muslim woman as she struggles with the shortcomings of her family and society - along with a battle to find her own confidence as she is hit with emotional blow after blow. This book will strip away preconceptions of the dutiful Pakistani daughter, wife, and mother - to show you an exceptionally dynamic woman, struggling with faith and pulling her life back together again piece by piece. There is no doubt why this book, and this author, wins awards time and time again. I highly recommend reading this novel.On a side note - my husband snagged the book from me when I was halfway through, and could not put it down.

I felt so invested with the character that I laughed, cried, and obsessed over decisions with her. I even wanted Arissa to be real, not because I wanted someone to have gone through this trauma, but because I wanted to meet her and continue to hear her describe her life in such an engaging, passionate way. I was honestly sad that the book ended.In terms of my ESL students, the subject matter is perhaps too adult for any but my juniors or seniors. Perhaps excerpts could be used in terms of the reaction to Muslims post 9-11 but as much as I loved the book, I probably won't add it to my classroom library. So, in short, I found a fantastic book for me but I'm still trying to find books about Pakistani/Pakistani Americans for teenage readers."}, {"userName": "Wksocmom", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1778996-wksocmom", "userReview": "I won this book on goodreads, and what a great find. This was one of those books I had to carry around the house, since I did not want to stop reading. I think it took me two days and I'm a busy mom. While I could not really relate to the character, I really like books that show me a whole new world, and in particular how people handle challenges. The main character had a wonderful life, and a very romantic story of how she met her husband, even though it was an arranged marriage. She was met with a series of horrible events and news, and while she suffered with grief, she came out of each with a new resolve on life. The author has such a wonderful way of describing each character, allowing you to feel their emotions.

I really really wanted to like it, and I definitely did *not* hate it. But, throughout the book, I realized a certain depth was missing - not sure if it was the plot, the language, or just something else in the writing style. The best way to describe it was like watching a movie on the Lifetime Channel, where the characters go through challenges and the story is good enough, but the plot is simplified, and sometimes, falls into place a little too easily. There were moments when I felt for Arissa, but they were few and far between . A great story pulls you in -- this fell a bit short."}, {"userName": "Sonia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/130841-sonia", "userReview": "Finally after all the books i've been picking up this year..this one kept my attention! I was very much impressed with Shaila's writing, as one critic put it, she's a \"word artist.\" Such beatiful passages, yet not so illustrative/descriptive that you get lost in the dialogue. Kind of had the emotional elements of P.S. I love You, which I also enjoyed. I found the ending to be an empowering move by the author. Loved it!

Not only is this the only tragedy she is suffering from, she is going through a troublesome pregnancy and has been told her child would have disabilities. She finds a novel that her husband had started & vows to complete it, but can't quite seem up to it. Her mother-in-law & father-in-law are staying with her through all this time & she finds a quiet, loving calm that helps her along, as her own mother was never quite the mother she should have been.

It is the story of Arissa Illahi, a Pakistani woman who was living in New York City at the time the World Trade Center was brought down by terrorists. She was barely awake when her husband left for work that morning. She had no idea she would never see him again.Arissa and her husband were Muslim, having married in their home country and moving to the U.S. to start a new life. They were expecting their first child. The loss of her husband devastated Arissa, not surprisingly so.Shaila Abdullah paints a picture with words that is extremely visceral. The grief and anger and loneliness left by the death of Arissa's husband made my heart ache. Arissa wanted to hold onto his memory as tightly as she could. It is through her grief and her reminiscing that we get to see how the couple met, how their marriage was arranged, and how they were living their life once married. They had their ups and downs, but they were so in love.As if the loss of her husband was not enough of a burden to bear, Arissa learns the child she is carrying has birth defects, the extent of she will not know until the child is born. It frightens her, but she knows it is something she must come to terms with.Arissa is fortunate not to be alone through all of this, even in those moments she feels most alone. Her family surrounds her, working through their own grief and helping her through hers. I felt the love and respect she felt for her parents-in-law. Arissa and her mother, however, are estranged; yet another conflict in Arissa's life she must struggle with.Saffron Dreams tells the story of how easily life's course can be changed by unexpected events. It is Arissa's story of how she met with one such horrible event and other challenges that forced her to re-evaluate her life and decide what direction to go next. She has to come to terms with what's happened and what is, It isn't easy for her and she makes mistakes, but she is a strong woman even in her weakest most doubtful moments. I admired this about her.The author captured the cultural and ethnic tensions well during a time when they were quite high (and to some extent, still are). Arissa's decision to wear a veil in public marked her as the enemy in the eyes of some. The veil was a symbol of faith and tradition for Arissa. It was a part of her. She endured threats and nasty looks from people who unfairly judged her. It angered me to see her treated in such a way.I was not entirely satisfied with one small aspect of the ending, admittedly. I think though that was more my wish for a happier ending on that front than anything else when the reality of it is that the Abdullah's version is probably more true to life--and deserved. I also felt that the flow of the novel changed a little too abruptly just past the mid-way point of the book. It was a place in which a major change in the characters' lives had occurred, and so to some extent that could be expected. It was as if there was a shift in the narrative voice even though the entire book is written in first person, in Arissa's voice. Those were minor things though.Overall, I found Saffron Dreams to be an emotionally charged novel, one that will stay with me for a long while. I still remember where I was and what I was doing the morning of September 11, 2001, as I am sure many of you do."}], "description": "\"Saffron Dreams\" is a tale of love, tragedy, and redemption from the award-winning author of \"Beyond the Cayenne Wall.\"..
