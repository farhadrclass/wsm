Have a specific reason for re reading, however, I find much more that I am loving and relating to in multiple ways.Difficult to believe there are few reviews of this incredible prophetic novel. Not only is it like reading the story of the 2008 economic crash but it was the cause of much argument and bitterness in the monied abd intellectual class in New York City. There are a few male wishful thinking sex scenes but I suspect men can not help themselves having these ideas and in the long run we profit from it for they long for us (women). From my experience dashing in and out of that world I find it to be an accurate view of the behaviors of all parties.

Thomas has written about the world of Wall Street and high society with the knowledgeability of Tom Wolfe and Dominick Dunne\u2014and revealed that world\u2019s inner workings with the aplomb of John O\u2019Hara and Louis Auchincloss. Now, in Hanover Place, Thomas paints his broadest canvas yet.Covering seven decades of depression, triumph, war, and tragedy, from the roaring, gilded 1920s to the projected chaos of the 1990s, Hanover Place is a saga of \u201cThe Firm,\u201d Warrington & Co., a great house of finance whose influence spreads far beyond Wall Street. And it is the story of the two families\u2014one WASP, one Jewish\u2014who dominate that firm.First come the Warringtons, whose proud name has graced Wall Street and New York society since the 1800s. There\u2019s Fletcher, the patriarch, and his son, Howland, whose 1924 marriage to Lyda opens the book. The dynasty continues with their children: Lex and Dee, the glamorous twins and heirs-apparent to Hanover Place; Andrew, reflective and decent, unsure about his Wall Street destiny; Jay, volatile and intuitive, a born trader; and Miranda, conceived in a moment of indiscretion, whose personality is dark and dangerous.Then there is the Miles family: Morris, plucked, at Lyda Warrington\u2019s instigation, from the ignominy of \u201cthe cage\u201d to triumph over anti-Semitism and become one of the great men of the Street; his wife, Miriam, fiercely protective of her children and ambitious for them; Max, their son, who believes the world should be his for the asking; and Arthur Lubloff, their grandson, who will emerge as the most influential and legendary financier since Pierpont Morgan himself. Sharing the stage with them all is a rich supporting cast of wives and lovers, heroes and knaves, fools and charlatans, great men and parasites.Hanover Place is not a conventional family epic. Frankly and without pulling punches, it depicts the world of high finance and high society as it was, as it is, and as it may well turn out to be. Its people move through history, now caught up in the great events of our time, now involved with the intimate dramas of passion, rivalry, and prejudice.And always in the background, humming with a million schemes and dreams, is the great city of New York\u2014and, at its beating concrete heart, Wall Street itself.", "title": "Hanover Place", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1962335.Hanover_Place", "average": 3.44, "cover": "", "reviews": 3, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/127148.Michael_M_Thomas", "name": "Michael M.
