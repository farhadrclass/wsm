Have you got that? No? Okay I shall tell you again. My name\u2019s Wolverine. This is my story. My name is Wolverine and I\u2019m invincible. My name is Wolverine and I have an adamantium skeleton. I\u2019m Wolverine. Okay. That\u2019s my name: Wolverine. I can heal myself because I am called Wolverine. It\u2019s my name, Wolverine that is. Do I need to tell you again? I\u2019m Wolverine I can\u2019t die, so there\u2019s no point reading this because there is no possibility that I will be defeated because my name is Wolverine. Oh dear. This was so fucking repetitive. Logan\u2019s monologue just lingered on the same ideas; he kept explaining his abilities over and over across issues. I grew so bored of him. It wasn\u2019t just him though that made this so poor. The side characters were inconsistent; they refused to behave in certain ways because of the sake of honour, but by the end they would do it anyway. Such hypocrites. I hate to repeat the ignorant assumption made by some Westerners that Asian people all look the same, but the Japanese in here did look the same. It was like the same face model had been used for each one, two of the women looked almost identical. I got terribly confused. Perhaps it was just me?Then there is also the fact that every single Asian character seems to know martial arts. Isn\u2019t that just a little bit stupid? Most of the characters had swords. Some were ninjas and there were even a couple of sumo wrestlers. I mean seriously? It\u2019s like Japan only consists of these types of people according to the writers of this. At points it\u2019s like the Japanese culture was viewed through a pair of stereotyping goggles. This just annoyed me. It\u2019s like saying all English people drink tea or all American\u2019s are fat.

(Check out my review of the movie on Shelf Inflicted.)While Logan is off in the wilderness dealing with a rogue grizzly and some dumb-ass hunters, his girlfriend Mariko returns to Japan with no explanation. Logan follows her to Tokyo where he is shocked to learn that Mariko\u2019s missing father Shingen has returned and set up an arranged marriage for her which she was honor bound to go through with. When Logan goes to see her, Shingen tricks him dishonoring himself in front of Mariko and nearly kills him in the process.Ashamed and heartsick, Logan finds himself in a rebound relationship with a female assassin named Yukio who is being pursued by a gang of deadly ninjas called The Hand. Logan tries to get a crime lord off Yukio\u2019s back without realizing that he\u2019s still caught up in a scheme of Shingen\u2019s.The legend goes that Chris Claremont and Frank Miller had a long car ride together when traveling to some event, and the two cooked up a story that would broaden the character of a mutant Canadian ex-secret agent turned X-Men with a bloodlust and a bad attitude into something more. This mini-series helped Wolverine go from being a minor supporting player as a bloodthirsty X-Man to one of the most popular (and overexposed) members of the Marvel universe.The story holds up pretty well for being over 30 years old at this point and while some of the cheesy tough guy exposition that Logan spouts seems like it came from a bad detective novel at times, there\u2019s a lot of moments here that would become iconic for the character including his oft quoted line, \u201cI\u2019m the best there is at what I do, but what I do isn\u2019t very nice.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Sr3yas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23097409-sr3yas", "userReview": "\"I am Wolverine.

But hey, it's Wolverine.... What did you expect?The Four-issue Wolverine limited series does one hell of a job combining Japanese theme and Wolverine's wildness. The ending of first chapter introduces Yukio, a crazy assassin with THE MOST irritating catchphrase.Please stop.The final two chapters are Uncanny X-men issues which follows up the story, but ends up being anti-climatic.

It forms a cohesive whole, but the two X-Men comics that conclude the story are the weak link. In the first two thirds of the collection, the character focus is solely on Wolverine. The last two issues collected here, although still dealing with the Wolverine storyline, spends a lot of time on the character of Storm and refers heavily to previous events surrounding Jean Grey / Phoenix. This shift in character focus is, frankly put, jarring, and breaks the story's rhythm. However, this is still one of the best Wolverine stories you're likely to read. It is the Japan sequence, and also the story being referenced (somewhat loosely) in the 2013 film The Wolverine. You'll be glad to know that there are no giant Adamantium robot samurais in the book. Instead, you have some ninja assassins, loads of intrigue and the villainous pairing of The Silver Samurai and Viper (and no, she's not a long-tongued mutant here either).This is a good example of why you should rather read the stories than watch the films. Anyway, I digress. The story is very good. I think this was Wolverine's first appearance in a series of his own. The Frank Miller art is glorious, even if it has that 80s thing going, and Claremont is obviously no slouch in the writing department if this collection is any indication.Highly recommended. This is mandatory reading for Wolverine fans. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the X-Men issues - I can't help but wonder how this would have been if Claremont/Miller had completed it under the Wolverine banner..."}, {"userName": "Ozan ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5914603-ozan", "userReview": "It was so much fun to read the book. Gave me a chance to sample the one of the most praised writters of comics, Chris Claremont and i liked his writting. I will definetly try his X-Men. The story was very modern, it didn't feel dated but then again as far as i know 80s is the foundation of modern comics so it is being still good is not a big surprise.Wolverine and his history with Japan is amazing. (I love Japan) I would love to see more, like how he met with Mariko Yashida for the first time and all of his time in japan before the mini. Wolverine's fights against ninjas were all so much fun to read even if i was like ''they are partying like it's 1580'' lol i mean katanas, shirukens and even Wolverine was like ''i don't usually do that but i will use a weapon this time'' and he brought a crossbow with him and hunted the ninjas with that lol Hello ! There are more efficient ways of killing people, you know... Have any of you guys ever heard of GUNS ! lol Yukio the wild one was a fun character, i liked her. I wish they showed what Yukio did with Storm to change her in to that crazy punk new look in The 2 issues of Uncanny X-Men which came after The 4 issues Wolverine mini in The HC. And ofcourse the guy who brain washed Mariko to not to marry Wolverine... Who was that guy ? Did he hypnose Mariko or something ? the end stayed dangling in the air with questions... I really want to read that era Clearmont X-Men to find out where all of those go now... It's certainly a minus that the book doesn't have a satisfying conclusion :/ and it's the only minus, really, oh there was Wolverine explaning his powers at every issue's begining too xD i was like ok i got it ! after the second time xD but i gave the book 5 stars never the less :D Wolverine fanboy reporting for duty :D"}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14386596-christopher", "userReview": "This is one of those books where it doesn't even really matter how good it is. This is the 4-issue mini-series from 1982, perhaps the first solo issues Wolverine really had*, six years before Wolverine finally got his own on-going series. If you are a Wolverine fan, it's required reading. I don't even know why you're reading this. Just pick up a copy.Maybe you want to hear about the two X-Men issues included. Fair enough. The 4 issue series is very Wolverine focused (of course), but the two X-Men issues are less so. There is a lot more focus on Storm, and there are some references to Jean that won't make sense because, hey, we're coming in at issue 172 of a series. That there are loose ends all over is just how it goes, but I will say that the two X-Men issues are weaker than the mini-series for that reason. They are still worth your time though because of Rogue. At this time, Rogue is still a new character (first appearance was 9 months earlier) who had started out as a villain. I enjoyed the interactions between Wolverine and Rogue as Wolverine tries to not hate her for what she did to Carol Danvers, and Rogue just tries to gain acceptance. The issues were fun 25 years ago when I first read them and they are fun now. They just don't wrap up nicely like the mini-series does.*I didn't go back and read all the old X-Men books to see if he got solo stories there, but my memory says \"not really.\""}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "3.0 to 3.5 stars.

I gave it 4 stars on my old review, and after letting it settle in for awhile, and then re-reading it, I'm convinced it's a 5 star comic. It's not brilliant, it's not mind blowing, and I couldn't imagine too many people seeing this from my point of view, but this book is just right up my alley. It feels like one of those old Shaw Bros. kung-fu movies, like when I read it, I felt like none of the words should match anyone's mouths.My favorite part is Frank Miller's art, which is amazing and just feels so vintage. I don't know how to explain it. One small thing that I love in comic book artwork, is when someone has black hair, and they shade it with a gleaming blue. It's a small thing, and you don't really see it anymore (except for Superman comics), but I love when they do that, haha.This is a fantastic comic, and a must-read for anyone breaking into the medium. If you're like me and the kind of person who listens to music while they read, I recommend listening to Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon album. The music matches perfectly, Money puts a really cool twist on the fight scenes, and Us And Them syncs up with the final scene almost eerily.5/5"}, {"userName": "Garrett", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36892346-garrett", "userReview": "Meh.

It was the inspiration behind the 2013 movie The Wolverine, which motivated me to pick it up. Logan travels to Japan to confront his lady love, who is engaged to another man. He becomes entangled in a complex Yakuza plot which he defuses with diplomatic class, skill, and grace by rampaging through half of Tokyo with his giant, adamantium claws. Overall I really enjoyed Chris Claremont\u2019s story. The series attempts to humanize Wolverine by giving him something to care about (other than slicing his enemies into little pieces) without compromising the character\u2019s feral nature. The Japanese elements were different and gave the story a unique feel. The artwork was strong and supplemented the story well. If the collection contained just the four issues published in the original Wolverine series, I would probably bump this up to four stars. However the two Uncanny X-Men issues, while relevant to the plot, were not quite as strong and were enough to drop this a half-star for me. Still, a fun read for those who are fans of the main character. Nothing earthshaking here, but very enjoyable. 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76688-eric", "userReview": "Frank Miller has his fingerprints all over the last 30+ years of comics, creating classics for Dark Horse, DC, and Marvel. His resume includes Sin City, 300, some of the most notable Batman comics in recent memory, and a long run on Daredevil. But besides those accomplishments, I had no idea he also did the first four issues of Wolverine's solo run. And let me tell you, it holds up a lot better than I expected from a comic run circa 1982. It is set in Japan, with two intriguing and mysterious women instigating Wolverine's actions, and for very different reasons. The storytelling is really top-notch, much more Yojimbo than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, thankfully. Wolverine is allowed to brood and brawl, and narrates the experience of being a gaijin, or outsider, for the reader. It's really perfect for his character, as a loner outsider wherever he wanders.The collection features not only Wolverine #1-#4, but also appends Uncanny X-Men #172-#173, where Storm, Rogue and the other X-Men get mixed up in the action when they travel to Japan for Wolverine's wedding."}, {"userName": "Donovan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27218681-donovan", "userReview": "[Seriously.

I remember when this collection first came out, but I was more interested in Spider-Man and Daredevil at the time, so I never read it until Amazon put it on sale for $1.99. I don't feel like I overpaid, but I don't feel like I got a bargain either.The story is fine. It's nice to see another side of Wolverine, although I never figured out why he was so in love with this Japanese chick. Maybe there's more background in other Wolverine/X-Men comics; I don't know. I never felt particularly invested in the character, and it never felt to me like he was ever in any real danger. That's the problem with having a character with a super-healing ability and an unbreakable skeleton: there's a lot of \"Boy, it's a good thing I'm invulnerable, or that would have killed me!\" The other thing I never understand about these stories is why Wolverine can take on 20 trained Hand assassins but a single old guy with a sword almost kills him. Is the old guy really *that* much better than these guys who have done nothing but trained to kill their entire lives? How does that happen? The Hand are like the redshirts of the Marvel universe: they exist to be dispatched quickly and easily. I feel a little bad for them.The art is mediocre. I know Frank Miller is supposed to be some kind of artistic genius (and I liked the minimalist style he applied to Daredevil and Bat Man: Year One), but his drawings here seem rushed and amateurish. A female Japanese assassin who I guess is supposed to look exotic just looks weird. The layout and coloring is typical for an 80s mass market comic book, which is to say not great.Overall, a decent read, but there's much more interesting stuff out there."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "Logan heads to Japan to be with his love, Mariko, only to find she's been married off by her drug lord father to a rich and powerful, but abusive, husband. And someone's trying to kill Logan of course. Cue extensive fight sequences involved ninja weapons, swords and ... snikt.Chris Claremont's story is pretty linear with Logan tussling with one group of foes before being knocked into another group and then being knocked back, etc. etc. This book showed that there are only so many silent fight scenes a reader can absorb before it becomes dull. You know Logan can't die so there's no tension, it's just waiting until he takes out whoever he's fighting.Frank Miller's art in the first 4 books is really good, and he provides at least one iconic image of Wolverine sans mask grinning and popping his claws. You can also see the beginnings of his Sin City style being tried out in this book as he experiments with shadows to tell a story than rely on shading or colours.There are 2 issues of \"Uncanny X-Men\" included after the initial 4-issue story arc to conclude the Logan/Mariko storyline but throws up other storylines involving the X-Men that you need to buy other X-Men books to see how they end (for some reason Storm getting a hair-cut is a big deal. Ah, the 80s... readers didn't ask for much did they?).\"Wolverine\" is a pretty tedious read for anyone who's read this character's other books. There's the detail on Logan's true love Mariko but other than that it's non-essential reading for general readers of comics.

First the good stuff.Chris Claremont and Frank Miller are great in this. The writing is for the most part excellent and tells story that is, aside from the retractable claws and healing factor, crime thriller/drama. Its dark, gritty, and really develops the character of Logan/Wolverine. Miller does a great job penciling this shadowy yet colorful world with a sense of movement and life we know he does well. The art and writing immerse us in this part of Logan/Wolverine's life that we don't always get to see and its a great story. I actually want to read the comics that come after (if they exist) showing the wedding.Now for the bad. This is a collection of comics, and each one is written that way. So you are treated to very redundant descriptions of who wolverine is and what he can do and how he's the best at it. I understand practically why this was done, so that anyone reading issue two or three wouldn't be lost, but that isn't an excuse for bad writing more of an explanation. If I was reading a comic today that do that issue after issue I'd stop reading it. Same thing with a tv show too, demand some intelligence from your audience and use some skill in writing to give me plot exposition with out spoon feeding it to me via paragraphs of stuff from the narrator. That is really the only flaw I find in the book. Unfortunately its a pretty persistent flaw that drags the rating toward the middle and away from the excellent.I bought this book from a brick and mortar book store, and I advise you to support them and do the same. And if you can't do that, at least order it online from a real person or an online retailer that does also have brick and mortar locations.

I've always been more interested in the Summers boys and their drama than anything else. Wolverine wasn't anything to scoff at, though, and I thought his part in the X books was an absolute necessity. So I don't love Wolverine. But I like him a whole hell of a lot. Over the years I guess it was easy to become less and less enchanted with Wolverine as the stories became more convoluted. Chris Claremont spent 17 years molding the X-Men into the the best selling series it remains today. With the popularity of Wolverine spilling over the brim of the X books, Marvel put Wolverine in the masterful hands of Claremont to enrich the Wolverine myths even further. With the help of Frank Miller, this four issue mini became the springboard for a torrid love affair with Wolverine and the comic-reading world. It's a fantastic story, told with a little too much exposition (which has always been Claremont's problem), which runs in the hardboiled vein, with plenty of crime, femme fatales, seedy underworld dealings, bars and alleys. It's a love story that helps to endear us to Wolverine, and a flurry of fists that gives us the action we've gotten used to in him. An instant classic, this volume demands to be read.

I'm calling shenanigans on that one since this bears all of the hallmarks of an early 80s Frank Miller story, who just happens to be the illustrator on this little X-Men related gem of a comic. Fast pacing, lots of action, ninjas and an introspective, brooding hero who narrates his way through what resembles a story but what looks a lot to me like one long well structured action scene.Because even when he's fast asleep Frank Miller can write and draw a stunning, epic tale and four issues of his Wolverine wandering around Japan, getting in scrapes, falling in love twice, fighting ninjas and mostly nearly dying is pretty much what I'd call a blast. It's basically a rehash of what Miller was doing on Daredevil at the time and without the build-up around the character and dozens of issues to play with it doesn't come close to having the same dramatic effect. Furthermore its pretensions to being a story about Japan and allusions to Japanese honour are a little tiresome. Miller is quite respectful with it so it never seems offensive, just reverential, but generally the talk of Japanese honour and culture feels a little hollow and reads like a cliche. But then Miller trades on cliches, he just makes us realise why some story tropes are so much exciting fun and well worth re-using.As ever, when Miller's name is on the book one of the main draws is the artwork, and this comic is another reminder of just how much Miller revolutionised the comics industry. Again, it feels a little like these pages could be Daredevil offcuts but even so nearly every one of them is jaw-dropping to look at, with Miller's work drawing you through the story swiftly and engagingly. Action flows and feels dynamic in a Miller comic, characters feel alive, real and threatening. Characters feel menacing in the way they are painted, Miller never strikes for realism, everything is a hyper real symbol that leaps out and across the page in striking ways.Whether you like X-Men or Wolverine generally, read this if you like Frank Miller. No, read this if you like comics. If you don't like Frank Miller you probably don't like comics much."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/205784-tim", "userReview": "It is tough to read this objectively after decades of stories have been added to the Wolverine \"mythos\" (if I may be so overblown as to call it such). I suppose, at the time of its publication, Chris Claremont's Wolverine was a dive deep into uncharted territory: Wolverine was previously a mysterious figure, and this was, so I gather, the first look at the motivations of the character...so, at the time it was probably quite provocative and illuminating.However, it doesn't really age well. Wolverine's ham-handed musings of \"I do bad things...i'm as tough as they come\" are cringe-inducing...and coupled with this early-style Frank Miller artwork that just seems awkward (in a \"not yet developed his signature style and is still kind of stuck in a Neal Adams uncanny valley\" kind of way), it's a fairly mediocre read. Fun, yes, but mediocre.And, well, that's more than I would have imagined I would write about a 90-page comic featuring a guy with claws fighting ninjas."}, {"userName": "Olivia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5607334-olivia", "userReview": "This was my first comic foray into anything X-Men related.

It was a grail title of mine, since I loved Wolverine's character, but it was always too expensive for me to buy to read. At some point, I wound up with the first issue, but I never got any further than that with the story. That first issue starts out strong, though, with an opening line as iconic as \"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed\": \"I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice.\"From there, we follow Logan hunting a bear that's been left for dead, but has instead gone on its own killing rampage. He finds the bear, kills it, and expresses remorse over the act since it had been driven to it; then, he tracks down the man who poisoned it but didn't kill it, fights him, and sends him to jail without any regrets. It sets the tone of his character, and shows him being more animal than man. In short, it defines all that is Wolverine.Then, it moves to Japan. Mariko is Logan's love, back in Japan and not accepting or sending letters. He goes to Japan to track her down, and becomes enmeshed in some crime drama related to Mariko's new husband. That's the point where the story goes off the rails and stops making sense. The Hand is involved, but it's hard to tell what's driving the crime gangs, and what their business actually is. For the story, Claremont only makes it clear that they're criminals, and organized. I guess he feels like this is all we need to know.What we do need to know, apparently, is Logan's backstory. We get it at the start of each issue. In four or five panels on one page, we get his name, hear about his mutant healing abilities, his adamantium-laced skeleton, and his claws. Even at the time of the title's publication, people knew who Wolverine was, and he was already a fan-favorite. Readers didn't need it reiterated with every issue, but that's what we get.Released back in 1982,\u00a0Wolverine is a comic that shows its age. At its time, it might have been a little progressive; it seems like Claremont did some research into Japanese culture instead of just populating the story with offensive stererotypes, and having a female assassin might have bucked some trends at the time. Thirty-five years later, the culturalism comes across as stereotypical, and the female characters are little more than story-dressing. Mariko doesn't have any depth outside of her being a daughter, or Logan's love, and the assassin, Yuriko, is inconsistent. During a fight, she's cut by a sword, and Logan notes that she doesn't make a sound, because she's tough like that; later, she's threatened by a crime boss, who grabs and twists her wrist, and she cries out, saying, \"You're hurting me!\" That she falls in and out of a relationship with Logan only reinforces that inconsistency.I hadn't known Frank Miller had done the art in this book until I started reading it, and it's sufficient. It feels kinetic, and isn't done in such a way that things aren't clear (in fact, there's a scene where, mid-fight, Logan pulls an arrow from his arm to use against another assassin, and it's done subtly enough that it's not obvious, nor does it fade into the background), but parts of it made me laugh. Every time Logan\u00a0snikts his claws, each one has to gleam in the light, and there were times when his mouth would be wide open in a yell (the better to show off those animalistic canines, my dear), only to be saying one word, quietly. The artwork didn't always match the mood of the story.I'll freely admit my expectations were too high for\u00a0Wolverine, but man, did it let me down. It's too much a product of its time to hold up well so many years later."}, {"userName": "Felicia Caro", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58888061-felicia-caro", "userReview": "Seeing that at this point I would consider myself very new to the comic book world, this particular series, Wolverine #1-4 and Uncanny X-Men #172-173 was a great place to start, but only given the fact that I\u2019ve already watched just about every Marvel (as well as DC) feature film that has been released since the \u201890\u2019s. So, I am familiar with the character of Wolverine and that his bones are of indestructible adamantium metal due to a scientific experiment done to him by the shady Canadian government agency Weapon X. Why did the government experiment on him? To create a super solider of course, for such is life in the world of superhero comics. I may add that many subjects of this kind, including Wolverine, are, indeed sadly, forced into it. Many already know that Wolverine is part of a band of superhero mutants called The X-Men. Even before he was experimented on, he was already different because he had a unique blend of healing power (any physical injury that harmed him would magically heal itself over a short period of time) and of claws, these being his bones that stretch out of his knuckles at will, although painfully. My particular fascination with Wolverine starts with the idea that he is an outsider at first, reluctant to join the group of fellow mutants, wanting only to live for himself and whatever else he holds dear. Even when he does join the X-Men he still is fiercely dedicated to his personal life and ideals, such as the life of a woman (the two loves of his life being Jean Grey, also from the X-Men and later, the royal Japanese princess Mariko), or, as in the beginning of this particular collection of comics, the life of a bear \u2013 an animal for whom he feels sympathy for, perhaps because he sees a bit of himself in him, that part being the primitive animal. Now, this makes for a really cool looking comic book. Frank Miller, who drew this series of comics is especially famous, and I know why, though I am not that well familiar with the art of comics yet to explain it. But my experience reading this story, after already having watched The Wolverine directed by James Mangold in 2013, was a positive one. I did not find the drawings from the \u201880s dated; the characters, in my opinion, had an aura of realism, and looking at facial expressions for cues was my favorite part of reading. I like this story \u2013 which starts with Wolverine saving a bear who was punctured by a poisonous arrow of a callous hunter who never finished the job, and then Wolverine killing the bear to save the poor animal from an slow death in agony, and finally finding the hunter to punish him\u2026 and I like how this entire comic features a ton of close-ups and extreme close-ups. Wolverine\u2019s anger expressed in intricate lines, his frowning mouth, his furrowed eyebrows, all express the character in a completely unique way. When I\u2019m reading a novel, I tend to read the print as a reflection, an afterthought, with lots of pauses for contemplation. When I read this comic book, everything seems to happen in real time, and the story flows steady, with every bit of it a part of the action. It\u2019s not better per se, but it\u2019s different, and although I know that this kind of reading is a good thing, I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 I\u2019m still trying to figure out why. Visual literacy \u2013 what exactly does this mean? I have the idea that the more I read comics, I\u2019m going to be better able to answer that question. The rest of the comic book really focuses on Wolverine\u2019s love for Mariko, again the royal Japanese princess, who he has been sending letters to for a while. He finds out that she never received them, or never opened them, due to the fact that she is being forced to marry out of a vague \u201cobligation\u201d her father had to someone he owed a debt to. Of course, it is Wolverine\u2019s duty to get her out of this predicament, which has a lot of bumps in the road. His run in and brief romantic affair with Yukio, one of Mariko\u2019s acquaintances, is presented beautifully, with super interesting renderings of body language. Wolverine\u2019s encounters with Samurai and Yakuza usually ended up in lots of fight sequences, which were so intentional and explicit in both the penciling and coloring (which, I\u2019m learning, is done by a different artist \u2013 this one by Glynis Wein) that it made for a quick and fun read. Lastly, I would like to mention the dialogue. Writer Chris Claremont juxtaposed the language of the Japanese men and women featured in the comic to Wolverine\u2019s language - the former being direct and formal, and the latter being tinged with an accent. (For example the word \u201cand\u201d is said as \u201can\u2019\u201d. He also has an air of teasing - he famously uses the word \u201cBub\u201d, many times when he\u2019s patronizing his friends or enemies, as well as other colloquialisms such as \u201cDarlin\u2019\u201d when referring to women.) I think this is brilliant and although this probably shouldn\u2019t be considered an \u201cethnic joke\u201d, especially compared to what I\u2019ve heard about early comics, I still think that, like the ethnic jokes of the earlier comics, this may actually also have the power to \u201cdiffuse the tension\u201d between groups (Rimer 5/22/16), or at least give audiences some exposure.Perhaps what I\u2019ve written here is trivial to the broader world of comics, but like I\u2019ve mentioned, I am very new to the genre, and these have been my honest thoughts on this series of Wolverine comics. I\u2019d recommend it to all interested, and would regard this as a text for mature young readers and adults.\"...I told him (Frank Miller) the idea that had been swirling about in my skull for some time - that the essence of Wolverine's character was a 'failed samurai'. To samurai, duty is all, selfless service the path to their ultimate ambition, death with grace. Every facet, every moment of their lives is absolutely under control. Wolverine, however, is almost a primal life force, totally beyond control, as graceless as can be. The one might be considered the ultimate expression of humanity - wherein the will, the intellect, totally overmaster all other aspects of existence - while the other is totally animal.\" - from the Introduction by Chris Claremont"}, {"userName": "Aleya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2996545-aleya", "userReview": "I am not very fond of the older stuff.
