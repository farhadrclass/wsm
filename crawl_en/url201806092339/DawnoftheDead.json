I have to admit that I have done this backward. I saw the movie many, many years ago and have finally gotten around to reading the book. In my opinion, George A Romero reinforces his title as the \u201cGodfather of all Zombies\u201d.I love what zombies do, and zombie books are never really about the zombies, but their effects on human nature and society. Zombies reset the playing field and put our moral compasses back to zero. They make us question what is right and what is wrong. Is it morally right to kill a person who is dead, but walking? Is it illegal to take something from someone who may or may not be dead so that you can survive? George A. Romero made us ask ourselves these questions when he unleashed his undead hordes upon the earth.Enough about the big picture stuff, let\u2019s get down to the book, Dawn of the Dead. I loved it! I felt like I was part of the story, going through the same turmoil as Roger, Peter, Stephen and Fran. I was brought back to a time when I was sitting in my parents\u2019 basement watching a movie I wasn\u2019t supposed to be watching, and yes, nostalgia does count for a lot. The tension was high and the monsters were simple, allowing the focus to truly rest on the characters.I don\u2019t care if you think that you know the story or that you\u2019ve read too many zombie books. Dawn of the Dead is a must-read for any zombie lover."}, {"userName": "Silver Thistle {adores JAFF & TEOTWAWKI.

This time I have to say that even though they're virtually scene for scene exactly the same, the book is still better.I never really got with the program on the Dawn of the Dead cult movie fandom. The acting was lame and the zombie's were hysterical and overall it just had a really, really bad 'B' movie feel to it. I know, I know...that's what makes it cult...I just didn't buy into it. The book wasn't that bad though, all things considered.The characters don't seem so cardboard and the zombies seem a 'tiny' bit more menacing, somehow, and I think that if this book was the first of its kind (as the movie was) then this would be great, but it's not the first and it's far from the best. The characters get a bit of an upgrade and have more of a 'zombie apocalypse survivor' feel to them. They're a bit more savvy and hardened to the situation and they're given a bit of backstory each, which makes them a little more fleshed out but you'd still recognise them from the film.I don't know why I was hoping for a better ending this time, since I knew what was coming but still I hoped for a bit more closure this time around. I was left hoping...If you've seen the film it's worth reading for the little bits of 'what's going on in their head' moments, and if you haven't seen the film then it's still worth reading as it's actually an OK zombie book. Consider it written at the same time as the film and you'll have an idea of what to expect. It's a 1970's zombie book. That's pretty much the size of it."}, {"userName": "Benoit Leli\u00e8vre", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre", "userReview": "It wasn't a bad novel per se, just perhaps a little bit unloved. Novelizations are byproducts by nature and it shows here despite Susanna Sparrow's best efforts. The book follows a very narrow path of precise events, doesn't take any chances with the initial product and the quality of writing take a nose dive about halfway through which is symptom of tight deadlines.Dawn of the Dead wasn't bad, though. It's one lengthy action scene with very little character development and Susanna Sparrow is quite competent at telling a gripping tale with very little tools to her disposition. She writes action scenes much better than most people on the market and it is one things that is pretty difficult to write. Dawn of the Dead has a trashy, pulpy charm (it was written in its heyday after all), but it cannot escape its fate of being a supplementary experience."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "The only way to really get the full meaning and quality of Romero's Dawn of the Dead is to watch the original unedited version of the film from 1978, without its unnecessary 3D additives and remastering.

Reader Christopher Ragland does a good job evoking the original iconic characters of the film, but doesn't waste time trying too hard and the reading is smooth and clear.

Romero is the grandfather of the zombie genre, and perhaps the most influential filmmaker of all-thing zombies. His influence has shone down upon pop culture in the nearly-forty years that followed the release of his movie, Dawn of the Dead. You can see it all around you right now with The Walking Dead in comics and on TV, Jonathan Maberry\u2019s terrific Rot & Ruin series, Brian Keene\u2019s The Rising, and Stephen King\u2019s Cell. I doubt that without Romero any of these latter stories would measure up quite as well. They are each a product of a very prolific history that traces back to the Romero movies.So, it\u2019s more than a bit of a shame that I found the novelization of Dawn of the Dead to be so tepid. While Romero is a fine filmmaker, his work as a novelist, along with co-writer Susanna Sparrow, leaves quite a lot to be desired. Originally published in 1978, the narrative holds up rather well and there are only a few anachronistic elements to remind you how many decades have passed since it was written. We get a brief nod to President Carter and, later, a \u201chuge\u201d twenty-one inch TV set that our survivors have to \u201clug\u201d up the stairs. My primary issue boils down to the writing itself, though. Stylistically, it\u2019s a mess. Character viewpoints shift on a whim, as if to capture the frenetic nature of a zombie apocalypse \u2013 however, the prose is fairly languid and wordy, which slows things down tremendously. And this being a zombie novel, we get plenty of references to the undead but with nary a change in descriptors, and I lost count of how many times the authors referred to them simply as \u2018ghouls.\u2019 It\u2019s a lot, though. A lot.With a seven-hour run time, this audiobook recording feels overly longer and much too ponderous. For a story about the fall of humanity and a quartet of survivors seeking shelter in a shopping mall overrun with zombies, it really should be a lot more energetic and punchy. There are only a few really good confrontations between the living and the walking dead, but too often I felt like the human characters existed in this novel mostly to just talk about the zombies. And we get a lot of talk about zombies. We get way more talk about zombies than we get actual zombies. By the time the finale rolls around and the survivors are confronted with a band of bikers/scavengers, the sudden conflict finally gives the book a bit of life, only far too late.Production-wise, the quality is terrific and the recording comes through crisp and clear. This is an Audible Studios production, and, frankly, I expect it to be good. Jonathan Davis\u2019s narration is solid, and he delivers a great reading of the material. Characters were presented well and with enough differentiation to keep track of dialogue. I don\u2019t really have any qualms about Davis\u2019s work here, and he does a serviceable job with the material he\u2019s been given.I\u2019m hesitant to recommend this title for anyone other than die-hard fans and Romero completists. While the film version of Dawn of the Dead is perfect bit of zombie cinema, the novelization is a lackluster affair that oftentimes descends into pure boredom. As far as zombie books go, though, there are many other better offerings out there. Otherwise, stick with the film version on this one.Audiobook provided for review by the audiobookreviewer.com"}, {"userName": "Chrissy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5929953-chrissy", "userReview": "I did not enjoy the writing style of this book... this is one instance where I wish I just watched the movie instead because I feel like I would have gotten the same experience without investing as much time.The book was tough to follow - I had to reread several passages because it transitioned from one scene to the next without any warning.

This is often attributed to the fact a movie can only present so much in an allotted timeframe, whereas a book can present just about anything it wants. I often read the book prior to seeing the movie because this allows me to create my own images of each character, instead of picturing the actor/actress in each scene. DAWN OF THE DEAD is a unique scenario for me because I didn\u2019t even realize a book version existed. Therefore, when I read it, I couldn\u2019t help but picture the cast of the film in my head as each scene played out. But even so, the book is just as entertaining as the film, and I suggest fans of Romero\u2019s celluloid classic snatch up a copy of this one as soon as possible.I love how Simon Pegg was picked to write the introduction. SEAN OF THE DEAD is a hilarious horror-comedy, but it\u2019s also a silent homage to the terrifying world Romero created. As such, Pegg makes the perfect person to set the foundation of the book.DAWN OF THE DEAD is written well and flows nicely, just like its screen companion. The prose is not overdrawn or lengthy, but reads quickly instead, allowing the action and the intensity to mesh into the story. I like this attribute, as it makes the book a quick read and an adrenaline-fueled trip into terror.The story is very much like the film, however we get much more backstory. I found some reviews from readers who did not like this aspect, saying it bogged the story down; I disagree. I think the deeper exposition gives us a broader picture of the characters as well as the plot. This grants a more fulfilling experience with the story.DAWN OF THE DEAD is a definite literary win for me. I recommend it to fans of the film and anyone looking for an introduction into Romero\u2019s dark world. The book is available now in a variety of formats, so give it a look."}, {"userName": "Jack Hambly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38658542-jack-hambly", "userReview": "While very similar to the movie, this story gives us greater detail as to who the people are, what their real motivations may be, and just how the world has gotten this way."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "Novelizations are always a little tricky to review. The entire idea of novelizing a film seems a bit odd. You are taking a separate art form and placing outside its intended existence. You could say that about going from novel to film too. Yet while filmmakers strive, in theory, to form a different creation using all the nuances of sight and sound, the act of novelizing too often comes across as simply another way to exploit and create merchandise to sell. That isn\u2019t to say that it can\u2019t be literature although frankly, I cannot think of one novelization that makes it so. But they can be entertaining and, at best, can add some insight to the characters and action that the reader may have already seen on film. Off the top of my head I can think of a few novelizations that do that very thing well: The Howling by Gary Brandner and Dennis Etchison\u2019s Halloween II and III and The Fog writing under the pseudonym of Jack Martin come to mind. These are examples of good novelizations of horror movies that stand alone as novels and add a little something extra to the films.Dawn of the Dead by George A. Romero and Susanna Sparrow is a novelization of Romero\u2019s classic film of the same name. The film and book originally came out in 1978. This edition from Gallery Books is a reprint published in May of 2015 and comes with an introduction by Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead). It\u2019s an entertaining intro but it doesn\u2019t really add anything of note to either the film or the novel. But I doubt anyone will buy the book for the introduction. So how about the book itself?Unfortunately Dawn of the Dead, the book, does not fare well either. In fact, it is downright abysmal. It does not add anything to our understanding of the film nor is it very entertaining. It follows the film action quite closely but almost to the point of sounding like a exhausted writer reciting a bored treatment. When we do get details that are not in the movie and should help move it along, it is of all the wrong areas. For instance we get detail after detail of our anti-heroes walking through the mall but their inner thoughts and motivation remain cartoonish with no real insight beyond what we saw in the film. What troubled me is that the film itself was full of subtle touches. Much of what is happening as the characters survive and fight the zombies in the stereotypical world of the shopping mall comes across as a satirization of our own consumer driven society. None of this makes it into print. What we get is a not very well written account of \u201cthey did that and then they did this\u201d. There is just bad writing throughout the book. The author will switch between two or even three characters doing something in entirely different parts of the mall all in one paragraph. It makes for a very badly structured and confusing narration.The novelization of Dawn of the Dead has little horror, little suspense, and little emotion. Those few who read the book without knowing the movie will be confused and bored by the haphazard writing. Those who saw the film will be better off passing it up altogether. The film itself is a classic and a must see for anyone who loves horror movies. For that matter, it is a must see for anyone who loves movie making. But novelizations like this one not only add nothing to the aura of the film but does the movie and the filmmaker a grave injustice, no pun intended."}, {"userName": "Martin Belcher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5636083-martin-belcher", "userReview": "In my opinion George A Romero is the \"Grandfather\" of Zombie fiction and of course films. Dawn of the Dead was the first Zombie film I watched probably around the early 1980's on VHS tape from a local video shop just before Margaret Thatcher's government of the time decided to ban what were dubbed \"video nasties\" and included the masterpiece that is Dawn of the Dead. I have watched the film many times since it was \"allowed\" an 18 certificate in Britain around the early 1990's, it has and always will have a profound effect on me, leading on to a lifetime interest in horror and zombie fiction. The setting of a middle America shopping mall in the 1970's and the juxtaposition of modern consumerism versus the walking dead is wonderfully curious and is still relevant today.So, it was with great interest when I saw that the novel version had been re-released with a special introduction by Simon Pegg (he of Shaun of the Dead fame) that I wanted to give it a try. Well I enjoyed it but not enough to warrant five stars, I guess I was expecting a little bit more than the film version but what I got was an exact cut down version of the film, I'm not saying this is wrong but just I was a little bit disappointed not to get a little bit more back story."}, {"userName": "T.W.

It is the movie that put me on the path to the career I am on currently (zombie author). It is easy to see the movie as you read or listen to the audio version of this adaptation. There are a couple of instances where a sliver of something is added to give you perhaps a new insight, but for the most part, this is the movie redone.Just about anybody could have sat in front of their DVD player and written this scene-for-scene adaptation and then threw in the possible thoughts of Steve, Roger, Fran and Peter. This did make Peter seem less likable than in the movie. Also, Steve comes across as a bit of a wimp and Fran sort of toughens up and adopts a hard shell. Not sure if I agree with those choices in the narrative.

Romero's iconic film and novel terrified generations. Now Dawn of the Dead is back to terrify once more. The world is being devastated by zombies. No one knows how far they have spread, or how to stop them. And as the living fight to save themselves, society collapses. Four people escape the chaos of downtown Philadelphia and find shelter in a shopping mall. As the survivors exhaust their greed and the undead scrape at the doors, the refuge becomes a prison. And soon there will be nowhere left to hide ...The classic horror that inspired a genre: if you haven't read this yet, you need to. If you have, you'll want to again. Includes a brilliant and exclusive introduction from Simon Pegg.My ReviewHow did I not know this book existed!! I found it by chance in The Works, on sale and had quite a moment to myself. If you have seen the movie you know the jist of the story but for those who haven't (where have you been!), the story is focused on 4 survivors of the zombie outbreak, trying to survive. As we go in, we start in the news broadcasting room as they try to cover the beginning of the outbreak and make sense of it. Soon people realize this isn't under control and make a break for it. What follows is the story of how they face the terrors and try to stay alive, and out there it isn't just the zombies you need to worry about.I loved the film and to be honest it has been so many years since I seen it (the original) I am not sure how closely the book follows (but a lot of what I do remember seemed to be present. The story isn't just a gore fest, although there is enough to keep the horror fans happy. It also shows the bonds and strains between the relationships, Roger and Peter, both professional killers trying to keep their head during the chaos. Fran and Stephen, in a relationship and now doing what they can to stay alive and help with the two trained killers.My only complaints would be the chapters seemed to morph from one scene to another without any indication it had changed, ie no page break or symbol to indicate where one scene ends it just goes straight to the other. With only 4 main characters (for the most part) it is still easy to follow but that can be a tad annoying. The other is how it ends, I am pretty sure the movie is fairly the same but I like to know every detail and not be left guessing or hanging so therefore it is a 4/5 for me. would love to get my hands on the other books so will have to search and see if they exist."}, {"userName": "Craig Allen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2731841-craig-allen", "userReview": "I'm going with 2.5-3.0 stars for this one. The thing is, you have to remind yourself this is was written a little after 1978 AND after the movie was out. So it's sort of like an adaptation of the movie, except it has parts the movie doesn't have. So with 2013 eyes, the zombies are kind of boring. They aren't really ever a threat, so it's hard to really care. The lead characters are just okay. The action scenes are even boring and poorly written. And I don't mean grammar really, I mean confusing as in hard to picture what is happening. The book also does my #1 pet peeve: jumping in between 3-4 characters thoughts on the same page. It's so difficult to follow. More chapter breaks or scene breaks would have helped, it was all just so confusing. Plus, another pet peeve is when a sentence has an exclamation point when it's not that exciting of a statement, it just seems so silly.

I was pretty disappointed by this audiobook. I would have given it two stars but things got a little better at the end so I upped my rating.

Besides being obnoxious, the sexism dated the book so that it seemed decidedly old-timey.I didn't particularly care for the narration but I think the material just kind of sucked. I doubt a thesaurus was used in the writing of this book--the word \"creature\" was overused to a nauseating degree. I found myself easily distracted and bored while listening to the book so at one point I started counting how many times the word came up. The word \"creature\" was used fifteen times in fifteen minutes and I think that once per minute average held up throughout the book. It got old.

Romero's various zombie movies, including loving even some of the less-well-received later entries. I wasn't expecting to love this book as much as the movie, but I admit, I really thought I'd like it more than I did.Movie novelisations are not generally looked upon as high literature or art, but in my experience they can be very interesting reads if you're a fan of the film. They're often based on early drafts of the script, which can give fans access to scenes that were deleted so early on they don't appear on DVD extras or in official script-books, or a glimpse into the versions of the characters the creators had in mind before a certain actor was cast and a their performance put a slightly different spin on things. In this case, of course, George A. Romero himself is credited with co-writing the novelisation, which could mean anything in theory - he could have taken the opportunity to resurrect (if you'll pardon the pun) all the darlings he had to kill during filming; alternatively, it may just mean that the novel was based on the script he wrote. I don't know what the case was here, but what I did discover, surprisingly, was that this novelisation reads more like it was written by someone who saw the film and then decided to recount more or less shot-for-shot what they saw onscreen than by someone who had access to behind-the-scenes information. Aside from a few paragraphs of backstory for each of the characters, this really doesn't add anything to what you see when you watch the movie. Romero is rightly proud of his finished product, so maybe he really did just want the novelisation to follow it as closely as possible, but as any fan who's seen their favourite book turned in to a movie will know, book-to-screen adaptations don't work if you attempt to translate them directly. Unsurprisingly, it turns out here that the reverse is also true.The prose is straightforward, which keeps the story going at a good clip, but at times it's quite distractingly basic. Any speech or action that's tied to a character's emotional state will be followed by a sentence or two that states in no uncertain terms how the way they were feeling affected what they just did or said. If Steve is irritated by Peter because he can see Peter doesn't think of him as a masculine man in comparison to himself, that is exactly what the novel will tell you. In a way, this does read like it's been pulled directly from the stage directions in a script. Similarly, while the movie doesn't exactly go out of its way to be subtle in its satire on consumerism, the novel will just straight-up tell you that the zombies are acting in a gruesome parody of commercial behaviour. As in, it doesn't even describe what they're doing and leave you to draw the obvious conclusion; the joke is explained in no uncertain terms, in places using the exact key words mentioned above. The book was also not terribly well proofread in places: while I only caught one spelling error, the sentence structure is surprisingly poor for a professionally published novel, reinforcing the feeling you get of reading a fanfic of the movie. Also, weirdly, there are no breaks between sub-sections in chapters, meaning that the action often leaps from one character to another, or between locations and times, leaving the reader trying to catch up to what's going on. Since the chapters sometimes run to fifty pages or so, this can make it quite a slog to get through. Possibly, this is why it took me nearly two weeks to read a 300-page book: I'm usually a very fast reader, and indeed when I did pick up the book I'd usually read at least one chapter in a sitting, but too often the prospect of returning to it once I'd put it down was just not appealing.Not surprisingly since it's based on a movie classic, the plot is the main redeeming point of this novel. In fact, had I not been familiar with the film, I would almost certainly have been tempted to add an extra star, because clunky prose and weird exposition aside, it's based around a great idea. At the same time, it's why I didn't give this book only one star, even though I've been harshly critical of it throughout this review. I haven't really talked about the plot, and that's because if you're familiar with the film you know it all already, except for a couple of little character traits thrown into the mix, like the fact that the mall was owned by an eccentric billionaire, or that Fran was married straight out of high school before her spirited nature led her into journalism, or that Peter had two brothers - one doing well, one in jail. But really, none of that was so ground-breaking as to either increase or decrease my appreciation of the story. They were nice little touches, but that was it. On whether I'd recommend this novel, I'd definitely say it depends on whether you've seen the film or not. If you have, I imagine you'll probably have an experience similar to mine, though you might well enjoy it more than I did. If you haven't, consider watching the film instead if you can. If you haven't seen the film and can't access it right now (as Simon Pegg's introduction in my edition explains was the case for him), the novelisation is probably a good place to start until you can get hold of the movies. It feels sort of sacrilegious to recommend movies on a book website, but there you are."}, {"userName": "Sarah Osborne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4993725-sarah-osborne", "userReview": "Has the staccato rhythm of a graphic novel, with the character development of a 70's B movie."}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8922470-eve", "userReview": "Seemed like a very matter of fact recount of the events of the film with a few interesting exceptions.Shame I read this just as Romero's death has been announced!"}, {"userName": "Zoe Blinko", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16036136-zoe-blinko", "userReview": "In true horror style, I'll try to keep this short and sweet. I felt it is only natural that whilst everyone seems to be on zombie steroids, what with the Walking Dead and the forthcoming release of World War Z, to start at the birthplace of the living dead genres.Expectations rise with Simon Pegg's introduction; the shopping mall idea sounds as though the filmmakers really went to town for their first zombie themed film. Somehow though, the novel, in my point of view, falls short of the praising accreditation that Pegg acclaims to this book. We start off with the conventional scenario (which I quite like at the beginning of my horrors), and are introduced to the quite stereotypical main four set of characters: the experienced, emotionless soldier with his accomplice trying to impress and reach his standards and the at first quite weedy boyfriend with his hormonal pregnant girlfriend in tow. They make the oncoming slaughter of waves of zombies interesting; at least they don't all do the same thing! The character development of the latter Francine character is something to note and probably one of my favourite things about this novel; a female who starts to fend for herself and not just become a crying wreck is something I always like in a horror. The mall scenes are the novel at it's best. I find it rather ironic that whilst the zombies commit carnage around them, the characters take a shine to the flashy new television sets and jewellery. It is most certainly enough action to keep you flicking the pages anyway. However, when the novel reaches a point of standstill, you start to have dwindling interest. After all (SPOILER), I just find it strange that after one character dies, they just all seem to settle into a family life. IN A MALL. The arrival of a bunch of bandits does shake things up abit after that, but after this has ended, the book just seems to end too soon and rushes the climatic events. Maybe if I was watching the film I wouldn't find this problem, but in a book I think this needs to be tuned just right; if it's not just right, it's disappointing. (SPOILER ENDS)I would recommend Dawn of the Dead. If your a horror fan, YOU WILL like it... it's just a case of individual tastes as to whether the eventual crescendo works out for you."}], "description": "When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth.George A.
