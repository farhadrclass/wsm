I enjoyed parts of it and other parts I found tedious.My first encounter with Glory didn't leave a good impression as she waffled about her relationships, she whined about her body, and she went about making stupid moves. I thought we had moved away from that in the last few stories, but yet, here we were again. Glory spent most of the book doing the double-standard thing between Jerry and Ray. It was okay for her to string along Ray because it was all in his best interest and it was okay to force Jerry to accept it for same best interest while all along she resents even a whiff of anything between Jerry and Mara and she admits that she has some interest in Ray. Glory had help getting into trouble in this one, but her decisions complicated things. This was a whole lot of have your cake and eat it too.Now, I had to rant a bit because I was annoyed, but in truth, Glory stays true to Jerry in the truest sense and while she feels physical attraction to Ray and likes him, it's as a friend. She loves Jerry. And as I said, she had a lot of help getting into trouble in this one with the encounter with a Siren who forces their cooperation to help her or they die. Westwood is back in town, Jerry's maybe daughter brought lethal friends, the EV vamps are still a menace, and the paparazzi just won't give them a break. Things got exciting and it took some juggling and some luck for the gang to all sail through only slightly singed.There were some fun reveals in this one and one major story arc was completed. Finally Glory gets to see Valdez in the flesh and get the truth on if Jerry fathered a child. Oh, and for those of us who need our Jerry fix, he and Glory get a couple of really steamy scenes. Whew boy, yeah!So, all in all, this was a good installment and I look forward to further adventures with Glory and the gang. Urban Fantasy fans who like things on the lighter, more humorous side should give these a try."}, {"userName": "CupcakeBlonde", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122689-cupcakeblonde", "userReview": "I really love Glory and Ray's dynamic in this book. Their chemistry is amazing. Almost makes me want Glory to end up with Ray, but she is totally meant to be with Blade. Even though he hurts her pretty bad in this book (and he had good reason to react the way he did to her being half naked with Ray, although nothign happened) their \"make-up\" sex is pretty hot and she truly does love Blade. My only beef with these books is that the storylines are pretty lame. But at least the good characters make up for it. However, once again, the ending was kinda ho hum. There is all this build up and then nothing happens. Or stuff happens but you don't hear about it until later. And then important things, like Glory killing Westwood, is sort of tossed aside as an after thought. But overall, entertianing. I would love to see this turned into a series and see who they would cast for the roles."}, {"userName": " PuMbA's MoMmy*\u2022.\u2665.\u2022* ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4756353-pumba-s-mommy", "userReview": "I love this series!! Summed up in 3 words: Sultry, funny & entertaining! I love Valdez he is my favorite by far. His quirky attitude makes him so hilarious. Glory is very funny & down to earth.

I read the first book in the series a while ago and truly enjoyed it. But as the series has progressed, I've liked it less and less. Glory used to be a character that I admired. I loved that she was a \"heavier set\" lady (even though I'd HARDLY call a size 12 heavy). But as time has gone on, she annoyingly harps on herself. *Slight soap box moment*Nothing irritates me more than when an author writes a female character as a heavy set woman and sucks all of the self-confidence and self-worth out of her. They always write them to have self-doubt and low self-esteem and spend chapters of an otherwise worthy story using it as an excuse to constantly drone on with fat shaming jokes and comments. Is it truly so hard to believe that a \"fat\" woman can't just be happy with who she is? It is inconceivable to believe that she can live a normal life like anyone else regardless of her size? Sorry for the rant, but it's so infuriating! Aside from that, the book was okay. It had a lot going on in it, which was at times a little overwhelming, but the core of the story was solid. The author created a lot of scenarios that kept me wanting to read on, and I did enjoy that aspect of the book. Overall, I think that the author should spend less time making her main character someone I don't want to spend time with, and more time on expanding on this creative world she's built.

So here's another one. *Spoilers after next paragraph* How in the world does Glory get herself into these messes? Jerry should have stayed in town and kept a better eye on her. First her new prot\u00e9g\u00e9e/fake BF gets drunk on New Year\u2019s Eve and loses his voice just before a special appearance at the Grammy\u2019s. Then they are blackmailed into providing Aggie, who\u2019s a siren, with three male vampires for her mistress: Circe. And Circe wants Damian/Casanova. If she doesn\u2019t get him and two other hunky vamps, she\u2019s going to take Glory, Ray and Will instead.  It bugs me that Glory gets so upset when Jerry has to go off somewhere with Mara, though leaving at the last minute on New Year\u2019s Eve isn\u2019t cool. But then while he\u2019s gone, she sure doesn\u2019t try very hard to keep \u2018loyal\u2019 to him. Seems like she has a bit of a double standard and doesn\u2019t think things through in her \u2018relationships\u2019 with other guys. She is such a hypocritical two-timer in this one I almost hate her. And she was so nice in the first books.  I was hoping Jerry would punish her for a least a hundred years. But I\u2019m glad they made up, since I really like them together. Even though he has a Scottish temper, you can tell that Jerry really loves Glory, just by the fact that he keeps getting her out of jams and forgiving her. After this book though, I\u2019m not sure she deserves him. Now if Ray would just get out of the picture. I do feel sorry for Glory with all the water dunking\u2019s and clothing changes. Especially since she hates water and loves to dress fashionably. Having Lily in the story is going to be interesting, especially since she doesn\u2019t like her mother either. And her boyfriend, Dracula, and his two buddies are loose cannon, but very cool. I\u2019m glad they got Westwood. But Glory\u2019s gang still have Simon to worry about. Wow. There\u2019s so many different people and factions at Ray\u2019s party, I had to struggle to remember who was who and what they were doing there and how they fit into Glory\u2019s plans. It was so confusing that I couldn\u2019t pay as much attention to the action line as I\u2019d liked. But it was hilarious. I bet Glory and her gang are glad it\u2019s over. And in such an electrically flamboyant way. Thoughts. 1)Is Aggie going to be around now? Not sure how I feel about that.  2)Flo and Richard are so cute together. He\u2019s so patient with her moods.  3)I hope they drop the whole blueberry thing. It\u2019s too corny and it\u2019s not needed for the story. Besides how many blueberry muffins, etc. can Valdez eat? (Don\u2019t answer that.)  4)And what\u2019s with Simon\u2019s chocolate? I kept expecting something to happen with that. Maybe he\u2019s just waiting. Fave scenes: Glory and Ray captured by Aggie, the 1890\u2019s New Orleans \u2018visit\u2019, Barry and the dumpster and the house fire."}, {"userName": "Erica\u2618", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3160102-erica", "userReview": "In the fourth book of the series, Gloriana St. Claire is back and, as always, in trouble. Jerry has left to search for his presumed daughter, Lily, in England. Glory is left in the care of Labradoodle shifter, Valdez, and newly made vamp, Ray Caine. This book was light and funny, typical of the writing style the author has used in the previous books. Most of the action takes place at Ray\u2019s leased home on Lake Travis in Austin, TX. Ray and Glory are captured by a siren turned sea monster and forced to bring her three hot male vampires in exchange for keeping them from the fires of Circe\u2019s hell. Glory worries that they won\u2019t be able to pull of the exchange in time as they only have three weeks to fulfill the duty. She cooks up a plan to get closer to the EVs (Energy Vampires) in order to lure them to Ray\u2019s home and the lake in the hopes of serving them up to Aggie the siren. What resonates is a chaotic series of events that lands Glory \u201cengaged\u201d to Ray and Jerry fuming because she left him out of the loop.As always, Glory is very entertaining with her \u201cI have fat thighs\u201d attitude about herself. She still cannot recognize that she has two, sometimes three, hot male vamps after her affections. Let\u2019s count them shall we. One, Jeremy Blade, long life lover and maker of Glory. Two, Israel Caine, rock star socialite who is infatuated with Glory for reasons she cannot understand at the moment. And sometimes three, Damian Sabitini, who is just in love with women and general and will hit on practically anything with a skirt. In my opinion, Jeremy Blade is good for Glory, but he can be overly controlling much of the time. If he would learn to let Glory be an independent woman he would be a perfect match. Israel Caine is to die for. He\u2019s got the looks, the voice, and the understanding. He doesn\u2019t try to control Glory and they read one another like a book. She is devilishly attracted to him. In my opinion, he\u2019s the perfect guy. I would have dropped Blade long ago. All I can say about Damian is to stay very far away. He reeks of the love \u2018em and leave \u2018em type. I would avoid him at all costs and that is exactly what Glory does.The story line for this book was great. It was different than many of the other paranormal books that I\u2019ve read before. The introduction of the goddess, the god, and the siren was an interesting twist. Above all it was a fun and light read. It was just as enjoyable to read as the first three books in the series and I can\u2019t wait to dive into book number five."}, {"userName": "Booklover Butterfly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3090545-booklover-butterfly", "userReview": "Real Vampires Don\u2019t Diet, the 4th book in Gerry Bartlett\u2019s Glory St. Clair series, is a good continuation of Glory\u2019s adventure filled life. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Glory has been left with no plans and nothing to do. She resigns herself to a dull evening when she gets a call from rock star and newbie vampire, Israel \u201cRay\u201d Caine. It seems that he\u2019s been drinking, and vampires and alcohol do not mix. Being the kind, caring person that she is, Glory heads off to Ray\u2019s lakefront house to save him from himself. As the evening progresses, Glory finds herself alone with Ray on his boat in the middle of the lake. Things only go downhill for them from there because they have an encounter with a powerful creature that needs help and has no problem coercing Glory and Ray to help.The plot is fun and suspenseful, but it\u2019s light and doesn\u2019t require any deep thought. It moves fairly quickly leaving no room to get bored, but not so fast as to feel rushed. I enjoyed how Bartlett weaves in humor throughout the novel. Glory\u2019s inner monologue cracks me up, but is also full of comments that all women can relate to on some level. This novel explored Glory\u2019s universe more revealing new creatures and mythology which could play a role in upcoming novels.After reading Real Vampires get Lucky, the 3rd book in the series, I was left wanting more of Ray Caine. This book delivered on that front because a significant portion of the plot involves him, so the reader will get a nice glimpse of his lifestyle post-vampire transformation. Glory is as delightful as ever. Every woman will be able to see a part of herself in Glory whether it\u2019s in her insecurities, sense of humor, or spunky attitude. Real Vampires Don\u2019t Diet catches up with many characters from past novels. This novel definitely had its steamy moments, but I\u2019m starting to feel like Glory\u2019s love life is becoming a little too routine. There are a few potential love interests that I would like to see Bartlett pursue for Glory. Every time I think Glory is going to change it up a little, things don\u2019t work out the way I\u2019d hoped. The romance in this novel was a bit predictable and familiar as a result. I\u2019d recommend this novel for those who have read the first 3 in the series. Despite my small complaint, I still plan to read upcoming novels in the series because the potential for some new and exciting romantic changes are there. Also, the ending of this novel makes me think that Gerry Bartlett has some very fun things planned for the next novel."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "Plot Summary: Gloriana (Glory) St. Claire the curvy, stylish, and undead owner of Vintage Vamp's Emporium is spending New Year's Eve alone.

I was enjoying Glory and the Blade/Jeremy. I have really come to like Flo and Richard, Valdez and even Damian. But I think this book has made me realize that I really don't like series which are centered on one woman's romance throughout multiple books. There are a few Series where it's been done ok, but all this back and forth between Jerry and her claim that she can't love someone because that means she will loose her independence - and the stuff with Israel/Ray... can't stand it. Not to mention, Glory comes across in this book as the most self-centered, selfish, witless, powerless, superficial, dummy. Worse then any of these series. And Jerry is one of the guys who throughout the series I can't really fault him for much of anything yet he gets the brunt end of all of Glory's crap. I really like the books with a strong heroine, not a whiney little baby - which is sooooo Glory in this book. I would skip the next except I read a review where the reviewer notes that Glory finally figures out what she wants. Let's hope so or the next will be my last in this series.Plot for those interested: Glory needs to keep up her sham engagement to rock star Israel Caine. So, she heads with him to LA for the Grammys. She also meets a vamp who claims he can help her loose weight. So, all those curves that she's always been so proud of - hell with them, she's going for the diet no matter how much harm it might do her. She continues to lie to Jerry all along the way. and she does the whole, Ray no Jerry no Ray no Jerry flip flopping throughout the book. Turns out the vamp with the miracle cure is a mortal enemy of Jerry's clan. There's promise with the effects the potion has on Glory, but the author doesn't use those effects to any advantage. Glory goes to the Grammys and I won't spoil the end except to say the next book will be back in Texas."}, {"userName": "Archer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933557-archer", "userReview": "Synopsis From: http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/b/g...Gloriana St. Claire - curvy, stylish, and undead - is spending New Year's Eve alone.

So yes, it was a noble adventure and all, but why did it have to happen on New Years? What can Glory do, pout? Nope, she\u2019s a big girl and decides to check out a few chick-flicks to pass the night away.

My only problem is that Glory comes across a wee bit like a whore bag. Open sexuality is awesome.

I would happily read about Glory and her friends again if I came across the other books in the series though I'm not sure I will be eagerly seeking out them out."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1630945-alex", "userReview": "This was my favorite one in the series so far. Glory has really grown on me, and the Siren subplot with Aggie was really fun. My big complaint with these books has been the focus on Glory's weight, which was unfortunately still at the forefront of this novel. I also find myself annoyed with her back and forth relationship with Blade. In this book however, I actually found myself torn between Blade and Ray and wasn't sure what Glory should do. I always thought she should be with Blade, but I'm not so sure anymore. I'm looking forward to seeing what's next in Glory's world."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5646542-michelle", "userReview": "Fun, schlocky, sexy vampire goodness. Bartlett did make a few dumb factual mistakes that yanked me out of the story, though. I can suspend disbelief for a 400-year-old vintage-clothing-shop-owning vampire with curves, her shape-shifting doggy bodyguard, and her ancient-but-hot Highlands honey -- sure, no problem. But tell me that a Jewish superstar pleases his devout mother by refusing to hold concerts on Saturday night, and you've lost me. Come on, if you're going to write a Jewish character, learn the first thing about the religion!"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1545908-andrea", "userReview": "This was another fun book in the Real Vampires series by Gerry Bartlett. Once again it was HOT! This time there was passion not just between Glory and Blade but between her and Ray too. It was fun to add another hottie to the mix. If I were here, I'm not sure who I would choose. I liked all of the action in the story and the addition of the Siren character. And I really liked the ending (although I don't want to give it away). I look forward to reading the next book in the series, Real Vampires Hate Their Thighs, although I have to wait until February, when it comes out!"}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18857429-margaret", "userReview": "Product Description Gloriana St. Claire-curvy, stylish, and undead-is spending New Year's Eve alone.

Having Ray as a newer character in the series definitely made this one a bit more interesting. My favorite part was probably that Valdez loosened up a little in his bodyguard role and we got to learn some more about him, so I'm definitely curious to see what will happen with him in future books."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Bolen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2105328-stephanie-bolen", "userReview": "I could get how Glory would be sick of being the same size for centuries, but the whining about it constantly, got on my nerves. Maybe it was just me, but she was super annoying and shallow this book. Yay, the villain from book one was taken care of, finally.
