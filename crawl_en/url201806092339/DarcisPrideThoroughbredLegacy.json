However, disaster seems to be striking at every turn and the family's legacy may be about to crumble\u2026unless they can find out who is targeting the family and their horses. This series has characters that made me care. It also had mystery, intrigue and, of course, romance. I plowed through this series quickly\u2026.dying to find out what would happen next. My only disappointment is that there isn't a 13th book to the series. I really want the surprise hero in The Secret Heiress to find his own happiness.I have to admit that I'm something of a book cover snob. I would never have picked up these books in a bookstore. However, Flirting with Trouble, the first book in the series, is by an author I enjoy. Because I stumbled across it as an ebook and downloaded it, I didn't actually see the cover until I opened the book on my iPod ebook reader. Good thing!!! I would have been disappointed to miss out on the Thoroughbred Legacy series.The series consists of the following books:(1) Flirting with Trouble by Elizabeth Bevarly(2) Biding Her Time by Wendy Warren(3) Picture of Perfection by Kristin Gabriel(4) Something to Talk About by Joanne Rock(5) Millions to Spare by Barbara Dunlop(6) Courting Disaster by Kathleen O'Reilly(7) Who's Cheatin' Who by Maggie Price(8) A Lady's Luck by Ken Casper(9) Darci's Pride by Jenna Mills(10) Breaking Free by Loreth Anne White(11) An Indecent Proposal by Margot Early(12) The Secret Heiress by Bethany Campbell"}], "description": "Six years ago, Tyler Preston was on top of the equestrian world...until one night nearly ruined him.
