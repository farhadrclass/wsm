Elizabeth was a given and she was such a great villain you couldn\u2019t help but to hate her and feel good about it. I felt sorry for her family for having to deal with her. I was very sympathetic with Rebecca, until she showed how she really did learn the lessons her mother taught her and she learned them well. Even her big act at the end didn\u2019t make me like her. David even had moments where I was cussing him out, mostly because he was so clueless and didn\u2019t get was a drain his family was on Jane. Once his eyes were opened to that loved his actions at the end of this. I was happy with Blaine\u2019s bold move at the end, he deserved some happiness. I really loved how he counseled David without telling him what to do or revealing his unhappy situation.Jane was definitely too good for this family. I hated how they all seemed to put her down at one point or another. I also got why the move was something that she needed, the physical distance just as important as a mental one.

And so, I borrowed this book from my friend. I borrowed it yesterday and today I had finished it.Actually, I started reading it in school, during our lunch break. As I was reading the first part, I find it somehow boring and my attention is not really in it (or maybe there's just full of noise and chit-chats in our room so I can't concentrate.) But when I got home and started reading it again, I find it interesting, that led me to sleeping late at night (or should i say very early in the morning next day).This book is not just all about romance. It discusses also about family, career, social status, and friends. I was really amazed by how Susan Mallery came up to this kind of story. It was actually good. This is a book that I can recommend for anyone who wants to read books that is not just all about love and romances, but also about life.:)"}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/627337-tina", "userReview": "I really liked this book.It is interesting because I don't think a lot of romance novel reading purists would actually like it as a romance novel. It borders on women's fiction even though there is a clear, centered love story with a defined H/h and a HEA. But what makes this book so darned interesting to me and probably why it might not be classified as pure romance is the weight given to all the stuff that is going on around the romance plot.Jayne Scott is the main character and her life is inextricably entwined with the the wealthy Worden clan. Her best friend is Rebecca the rebellious daughter who has a hate/resentment relationship with her mother, Elizabeth. Jayne has always had a major crush on the eldest Worden son, Daniel. He is the super handsome golden boy who is the apple of his mother's eye. Blaine Worden is the benign head of the family. He has a soft spot for Jayne and is generally amiable. And then there is Elizabeth. She is the steely-eyed, society conscious, snobbish matriarch. When Jayne was just a teenager, her own mother, a housekeeper to a neighbor of the Worden's died quickly and left Jayne alone, homeless and penniless. The Worden's took her in and she and Rebecca became fast friends. A lot of the texture of the book is about the shifting relationships between the Wordens themselves and with Jayne.The book starts out very light and amusingly with both Rebecca and Daniel returning home both having lived abroad for many years. Both of them have their own reasons for coming back to LA. Jayne is just thrilled to see her best friend again and a little squirmy to know that the object of her long time unrequited lust/love is back home to stay. Their return sets off a series of family revelations. So as I was reading I was really expecting a very simple contemporary romance. But about 2/3 of the way through a shift happens in the book. The characters, especially Rebbecca, become a bit deeper, more problematic and more intriguing. The drama ratchets up. The lightness disappears. The romance has more resonance and urgency. At first I was a bit jarred, thinking it was a bit of a bait and switch. But the more I read the more I realized that the earlier, lighter tone of the book was just that.. a tone. The groundwork for the characters and their later motivations had been laid. I just hadn't been paying attention.I liked the trajectory of the romance. Daniel finally notices Jayne. He has a lot more substance than we are first led to believe. He was a great hero and I enjoyed the way he and Jayne were able to communicate.Elizabeth is the villain of the book. And she is the great weakness of the book because she is a bit of a cardboard. It was very easy to hate her because she had no redeeming. But I enjoyed the positioning of her and Jayne's relationship in the larger picture because it added to the drama in a big way.Rebecca is probably the most fascinating character study. She, more than any other character, embodies the my feeling of the flow of the story -- starting out one way and ending up another. I really had to think about this character as I closed the book.The ending of the book was a bit abrupt. I turned the page and expected another chapter but didn't get it. I do expect that given he ending, we may see Rebbecca's story forthcoming. I would be very interested to read it."}, {"userName": "Francesca Marinaro", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5750649-francesca-marinaro", "userReview": "Warm, comforting, and sweet--a mug of hot chocolate on a blustery fall afternoon. That was what I expected when I picked up this novel; that was what I got. IF you enjoy light, easy-on-the-brain romance fiction, you won't be disappointed. Susan Mallery's plot is predictable; we know precisely where and with whom the characters will wind up, but like the Jane Austen novels from which Mallery draws upon so heavily, the magic of this romantic story is not the thrill of finding out what happens in the end, but how the characters get there. I liked the way that Mallery laid emphasis on David as the prize plumb; we're all aware--at least if we've read Pride and Prejudice--that \"it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\" but all to often we forget that these young men, semeingly on the hunt for rich heiresses, are frequently the pawns in the match-making games of many an ambitious mother. Mallery drives this idea home (like an icepick to the brain) through Elizabeth's character. an interesting combination of Mrs. Bennet's irritating, nosy interference and Lady Catherine DeBurgh's haughty, overinflated opinion of self-worth, Elizabeth Worden might not be charming, but she's fully alive to the fact that, whether 19th century England or 21st Century Beverly Hills, the mother pulls the strings from which her son must dangle precariously on the marriage market. If we're going to read this as a contemporary retelling of Pride and Prejudice, that's probably Mallery's strongest selling point; aside from that, between the frequent mentions of Austen, the teasing jab at the \"long version of Pride and Prejudice...the Colin Firth version,\" and the Lifetime movie comparisons, I felt like I was being beaten over the head with cliches, though admittedly, I should have expected nothing less and only have myself to blame for not wearing my chicklit armor. I don't know whether Mallery was intending to convince her readers that her novel isn't just another retelling of Jane Austen or if she was trying to carve a creative niche for herself within that sub-genre; if the former, methinks the lady doth protest too much. IF the latter, the novel doesn't strike me as any better or worse than similar stories. Fans of Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones novels might appreciate the sexual tension (not to mention the wink and nudge in the direction of the \"long version\" of Pride and Prejudice that inspired the creation of Mark Darcy, but they'll miss the tongue-in-cheek British humor and colorful pros that make Fielding's novels the perfect blend of hilarious and heartwarming. About the characters: I found them to be simply-rendered, but convincing. We have no problem cheering for Jane as she transforms from a shy, unassuming girl into a strong, self-assertive woman; we fall, with very little pushing, into David's open arms; we're alternately irritated with and sorry for Rebecca--I've-got-everything glamor girl on the outside, insecure child on the inside; we feel a savage pleasure as we witness Elizabeth's downfall. Altogether not one of my personal favorites, but like that cup of hot chocolate, it hits the spot if you're in the mood for something warm and fluffy."}, {"userName": "Aisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/987170-aisa", "userReview": "The Best of Friends is not a romance story. While Jayne and Daniel has their own love story, Rebecca with her torrid affairs, and the rest of the Wordens with their own romance lapses, this is definitely not a romance story. Like its title, it tells us about the friendship between two very different woman, Jayne and Rebecca. Each comes from a very different society but incidentally becomes friends. At the beginning, I believe Rebecca has a heart under her facade. Yes, Rebecca is a selfish person. I don\u2019t expect her to turn angelic but the story\u2019s progress drives her character worse. She becomes the ultimate bitch in the story (if not her mother \u2013 which I am totally alright with her being so superficial \u2013 considering she is a secondary character). The men do not really have their own substance. I mean, now and then, we get a glimpse of what they are thinking, but that\u2019s it. It just comes and goes. Jayne is a push-over, goody-two-shoes, with a specific allergy to the riches. I like Jayne and Rebecca and when they\u2019re together as friends, great. Both of them are not perfect and the dynamics between the characters (all of them) are quite interesting. The ending seems loose. It leaves us the question about the outcome. Will Rebecca get Jayne\u2019s forgiveness or not? Since it is a stand-alone book, we\u2019ll never get the question answered. It will depend on the reader. The upside is it is a unique book with not-oh-so-perfect characters. Real characters. I just wish the author will give a little heart for Rebecca\u2019s mother and a little substance to the male counterparts."}, {"userName": "Sarah Eiseman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4537317-sarah-eiseman", "userReview": "This book was an interesting change from the typical Mallery plots. This book definitely had some nonredeemable characters, which is often a challenge to read. You want to like everyone for something, but these folks left little to work with.Jayne Scott has lived through some tragedy in her life. Her mother died when she was young, but fortunately, Jayne was invited to stay with a wealthy family while she grew up. This family, The Wordens, helped her graduate from college and buy a small condo, but they made her pay a very different price with her life than money. The narcissistic mother and daughter have drained Jayne for years, but because of her giving nature, she doesn\u2019t realize that anything is amiss. That is, until she recognizes her love for the Worden\u2019s prodigal son, David.The complicated relationships between Jayne and the women in this story was truly amazing to read. I\u2019m continually impressed at Mallery\u2019s ability to keep me interested in all her books. The depth of these characters and the emotions that Jayne went through trying to understand the motivations of those around her was immense. A difficult book to read at times, I really enjoyed this book by the time I was done.If you are looking for a more fiction-than-romance book by a romance author, this is a great book to pick up.

Interesting characters, interesting dynamics between all of the characters, interesting variety of personalities and backgrounds. The fascinating feature of this book is the way each of the characters views the world when the book starts and the way most of them are changed by the dynamics of the interactions. I found myself disliking, but understanding the reasons for the mother and daughter's actions and view of Jayne, David and Blaine. The behavior of Jayne, David and Blaine was less comprehensible to me. I loved each of them as individuals, but found their inability to understand and correct the things that were wrong a little contrived. In the end it all comes right, but they had to run away to do so. In my mind a confrontation would have been more satisfying."}, {"userName": "Janga", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1206531-janga", "userReview": "I\u2019m not sure how to grade The Best of Friends. If it\u2019s truly a stand-alone book, then the ending leaves me dissatisfied. In women\u2019s fiction, an HEA for a couple is not enough. I want a clearer sense of closure for the women\u2019s journeys. In this case, I particularly want to see more than just a hint of Rebecca\u2019s redemption. If this is the first of a pair or more books, on the other hand, it leaves me primed for the continuation of the story. But I haven\u2019t been able to find if there is to be another book. Thus my dilemma: if the book is a stand-alone, it\u2019s a three-star read for me\u2014an engrossing story but one that left me feeling cheated at the end. If Rebecca\u2019s book is to follow, then it\u2019s a 4.5 star book that leaves me eager to see this character suffer and grow and to discover whether even her growth is enough to salvage the relationships she destroyed."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3252002-donna", "userReview": "I generally liked this book.

He handed her one. \u201cI don\u2019t plan. Sometimes the opportunity presents itself, and I succumb to the temptation.\u201d \u201cResist,\u201d she snapped. 2)Back to the real world, where girls like her didn\u2019t get the handsome prince, and the glass slipper never really fit.Jayne Scott, poor little orphan girl who was brought into an incredibly wealthy family is, ten years later, still paying thanks by being an \u201cassistant\u201d to the grand dame of the family, Elizabeth. Sure, Elizabeth and her husband took Jayne in when her mother died and paid for her college, but Elizabeth treats her like a parlor slave in the antebellum south. The daughter, Rebecca, bane of her mother\u2019s existence and Jayne\u2019s best friend, is nearly as bad as her mother, whom she claims to despise (hint: they\u2019re exactly alike). And yet, Jayne feels some kind of obligation to the two of them, and continually lays down for them to walk all over her.I liked Jayne. She was a smart girl, independent, kind, but she had a very overinflated sense of duty and had been told (or treated) too many times like she was insignificant and unworthy. At the snap of Elizabeth\u2019s fingers, she comes running to do her bidding. Enter David, the \u201cyoung prince\u201d of the family returning home, the man who Jayne has been in love with for over a decade. Elizabeth insists that Jayne help David to find the perfect house for his future wife and family and other inane tasks such as assisting Elizabeth in throwing parties designed to catch said wife. But not just any wife, someone \u201cappropriate,\u201d wealthy, successful, someone in his league. Which of course, leaves out poor Jayne. The story takes place in Los Angeles, which is entirely suitable for the selfish, self-centered characters that inhabit it. I\u2019ve read stories like this before, about people who are abused in one way or another and just keep taking it. They usually make me mad and I have to stop reading them. But Jayne was a very strong character. Yes, she keeps going back for more abuse, but it\u2019s not because she feels like she deserves it, but because she expects better from them and they keep letting her down. But then Jayne finally finds a way to break away from them, the hits just keep coming. I don\u2019t know how many times the phrase \u201cit\u2019s not about you!\u201d is written, but it probably should have been the name of the book. The love story about David and Jayne was lovely. Overall, I enjoyed the book. I did have a small issue with all the different points of view (almost as many as the number of characters), but it wasn\u2019t so bad. I\u2019ve read a few Susan Mallery books and they\u2019re not generally this depressing (are there really people like this who only think of themselves to such a degree that they think they\u2019re helping you when they tell you you\u2019re not good enough? I hope that\u2019s not the case), but I cannot wait for the more light-hearted Fool\u2019s Gold series that comes out next month.

Surprisingly, I enjoyed this book. After I got into it, I couldn\u2019t put it down.Best of Friends is the story of Jayne Scott, orphaned daughter of a housekeeper; Rebecca Worden, Jayne\u2019s best friend since childhood and daughter of a wealthy family of jewelers, her brother David Worden and Elizabeth Worden, the evil matriarch of the Worden clan.I loved the relationship between Jayne and David. I loved the dialogue they had with each other. They had a chemistry, but it was deeper than that. I liked that Jayne made David think and question his perspective on things.I especially liked that Jayne was not wanting to be saved by David. She had no interest in David\u2019s money. The fact that he was a Worden was actually a strike against him.I liked Rebecca and felt that she genuinely seemed to care fore Jayne. However, her behavior was too one-dimensional. Although she, and her family, kept making a point of noting that she was self-centered, it was almost too much. While I understood that Rebecca liked Jayne because it kept her from being alone, I never understood what Jayne got out of the relationship or why they would remain friends for so long. I did not like that she was so static. Over the course of the book, Jayne went from being a lap dog to the Worden\u2019s to an independent woman relying on herself. Rebecca never changed, if anything, she became more selfish for no apparent reason.I had the same problem with Elizabeth. She was terrible to Jayne. She was terrible to her husband and she was terrible to her daughter. It was never fully explained why Rebecca and Elizabeth didn\u2019t get along. It was a feud that went back a long time, but the reader was never told when or how this feud started.I also never understood Elizabeth\u2019s motivations. She says time and again that she only took in Jayne in order to parade her god deed in front of the others in her social set, but as a reader, I never understood why she was such a terrible person. Elizabeth, too, was static. She never changed. Even as her world began to fall apart, she remained the same bitchy person she had always been.I also wished some time had been spent on the relationship between Blaine and Elizabeth. For most of the book, Blaine was in the background. For a book that is supposed to be about the relationships between Elizabeth, Jayne and Rebecca, this is really Jayne\u2019s book as most of the time is spent on her growth and change.The end, in my opinion, was a bit ridiculous and felt rushed. It didn\u2019t fit with the rest of the book, which did a very good job of moving forward. The end just stopped. I wish things had been more wrapped up with Jayne and Rebecca, Jayne, Rebecca and Elizabeth, and even Blaine and Jayne. An epilogue would have been nice.Overall, though, this was a good book well worth reading. I recommend it for the beach."}, {"userName": "S.J.

It has all the markers of a well plotted story; the reader is exposed to the hubris belief and guilty pleasures of the upper class society.Mallery has developed a great heroine in Jayne Scott, the guilty party in a web of codependency. The other codependent heroine is the wild child Rebecca Worden who is working through her own Mommy issues. Both are best friends who care for each other through tough times. The villain, Elizabeth Worden, is responsible for much of their pain and is compelling to read.Mallery does take time to make the male characters interesting but the focus stays on the three women, who are the controlling forces behind the reactions of the other characters.

The heroine, Jane, has troubled relationships with the women in the hero's family, and much of the book focuses on her interactions with them. The author has an excellent understanding of personality disorders and effectively depicts a mother and daughter who are so narcissistic they are unable to give a damn about anyone else's happiness. In some ways the book reminded me of a Regency romance, because Jane was a poor girl whose mother died and she was then taken in and educated by the wealthy Worden family. Mrs. Worden then expected Jane to be at her beck and call, and Jane complies for ten long years. For many years, Jane has had a crush on David, the family heir, who has never noticed her as anything more than his sister's girlfriend and his mother's helper. When he and Jane become involved, she finally grows a spine, which is very gratifying. My favorite part of the book was the witty repartee between David and Jane--the author is great at dialogue. The mother and sister are sometimes so overbearing that they are one-dimensional, although I recognize that there truly are people like this in the real world."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/949924-maria", "userReview": "My first thought upon reaching the end of this book was that if this is the way the rich think, act, and talk, then I want nothing to do with it and there goes the American dream. My next thought was that Elizabeth and Rebecca could not possibly be as bad as they were portrayed. Somewhere there must be some redeeming features, but search as I did, I couldn't find a single one. The book is really about Jayne, a thoroughly nice and quite capable nurse whose one flight into fantasy is David, Rebecca's brother. You get to know Jayne quite well, David less so, but end up cheering for two of the rich, not quite of this world, characters in David and his father Blaine. Rebecca is a disappointment to her family and to the readers. Elizabeth -- well, let's not go there. My main gripe is that there was very little nurse and medical activity in the book. If your main character is a nurse, even with a broken wrist, I would expect a little more of her work life to be showplaced, since it goes into making her what she is. There was a little but only a very little."}, {"userName": " Arushi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5620615-arushi", "userReview": "Even though it started off as slow- reeeeally slow- it did pick up. It picked up so much that everything was happening at once , so it was a \"O_O\" kinda situation..That aside, I really liked the characters. They weren't extra-ordinary or anything but I liked how Jayne moved from being such a push-over to someone independent. I liked that she finally found her voice and stood up for herself. I liked Elizabeth and Rebecca. They were both super selfish and thought only about themselves and it was interesting how someone like Rebecca bothered being friends -scratch that BEST friends- with someone like Jayne. They're people from the opposite ends of the spectrum. Totally different from each other so I liked reading about their friendship.The relationship between David and Jayne was super neat though. One of the best things about this book was the romance between them. I found it so funny that whatever Rebecca did was actually only to piss her mother off. Except for the ending being a little vague I liked the rest of the book. Fun read :)"}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2053681-tiffany", "userReview": "Outstanding book!!! I have been a huge fan of Susan Mallery's books forever, but I will say I am getting a little bored with the Fool's Gold series. They've been ok, but definitely not her strongest series (loved the Buchanans and the Bakery Sisters). For the most part I prefer her stand alone stories, which is why I was so excited to read this book. Our lead character, Jayne, has to be my favorite female lead since Gracie in Falling for Gracie. Jayne is smart, down to earth, clever, and strong. It was fun to watch her find herself in this book and make decisions that were right for her and her life. I also enjoyed the dynamics of the Worden family. It's been a long time since I have disliked a character as much as I disliked Rebecca and Elizabeth. I won't give away any spoilers, but I was glad to see the author deny us a clean and finite ending. This book reminded me why I started reading Susan Mallery's books to begin with. I can't wait to see what she writes next!"}, {"userName": "Laura Beasley", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3424861-laura-beasley", "userReview": "Would really give this book 3.5 stars. A good story. The ending is predictable but interesting too. Jayne goes to live with the wealthy Worden family when her mother dies her senior year of high school. She has always had a crush on the son David but when he comes back to town 10 years later he sees her as someone other than is sisters best friend.. Jayne has spent 10 years trying to thank Elizabeth- the mother- for taking her in and has been used by her as an unpaid assistant. Rebecca the daughter who sId Jayne is her best friend cares only for herself. How can Jayne break free of this family and be herself? Where or does David fall Into this plan? Also do Elizabeth and Rebecca get what they deserve? Story has some substance and some good life lessons? What should really be important! Enjoyable and quick read. Have read a couple of her books and think this is my favorite so far."}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/803515-gail", "userReview": "I liked this book a lot. Mallery writes great family dynamics and great friendships, and she does her usual stellar job with this one. I really love the way she writes her confrontations and fights and making up and-- well, I just enjoyed this one. Jayne--a nurse--and Rebecca, a jewelry designer from a rich jewelry mogul family, have been friends since high school, since Rebecca's family took Jayne in after her mother died. Now Rebecca's come home after a 10-year exile, and her brother's come home too, which turns the family dynamic into a whole new... mess. Rebecca and her mom have been at war pretty much since day 1, and now it escalates and everybody gets dragged in to the mess and--it's just a great story. I had to go back and re-read parts of it after I finished, and I'll probably pick it up one more time before I have to take it back to the library."}, {"userName": "Brittany (The Book Addict's Guide/Novelly Yours)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4471081-brittany-the-book-addict-s-guide-novelly-yours", "userReview": "I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I was worried at first with the Worden family being one of extremely substantial wealth and lavish life-styles because that's been something I've never connected to in a book, but I feel like I could identify well with Jayne. I loved the one-liners between Jayne and David and the way their relationship developed. The constant animosity between Rebecca and her mother were a little too intense for me at first, but throughout the book you get to know the characters and I like the way they build off of each other and the extreme dysfunction in their family ties together to create an understanding. Overall, I really enjoyed it. I read straight through after I was about halfway through so that's definitely saying something good!"}], "description": "New York Times bestselling author Susan Mallery is at her heart-stirring best in this witty, richly layered story about friendship, love, and breaking free.In high school, studious Jayne Scott and wild child Rebecca Worden became unlikely best friends\u2014a tie that endured even after Rebecca fled her family to live overseas.
