I do think that I liked Dan's first book a bit more, but I still really enjoyed this book. The one negative thing that I can pin point is that this book seems to follow a similar story structure to his first book, The Honest Truth. Both stories are about boys who go on a journey facing big obstacles along the way. I didn't really mind that though, because while they follow similar story structures, this one had nice twists and turns along the way. This book goes into some really dark and violent places and that was completely unexpected, but I'm glad it went in the direction that it did. Overall I really enjoyed this and can't wait to see what's next for Dan Gemeinhart!"}, {"userName": "Colby Sharp", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5186758-colby-sharp", "userReview": "2016 is going to be a very good year for books.

This book is for anyone who has a closeness to an animal/pet that can't be explained, but especially for kids who have grown up with horses. This book is also for the Hatchet fans and Alabama Moon readers. I also see my dormant readers enjoying this story. What's not to like? Set in 1890 at the end of the Westward Expansion Joseph has lost everything. His Dad from a wagon accident and his Mom and sister die from Typhoid. His horse is unexpectedly sold. As a result he sets out to find her. This is a story of family bonds, empathy, knowing right from wrong and being a positive influence in a society that is just learning how to be civil with one another. Along the way the reader will be astounded by the maturity Joseph shows in getting out of some pretty scary predicaments as he trails his horse through the Cascade Mountains. Through this story the reader will learn what it means to respect and honor people of all walks of life. Especially important today when society is quick to condemn people who are different. Highly, highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Mary Lee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221992-mary-lee", "userReview": "Don't tell my students that I finished this book ahead of our read aloud schedule. But it's a good thing I did. If you needed tissues for The Honest Truth, get two packs for this one. I'm sure I'll still cry reading aloud the last few chapters, but at least I might be able to do it without sobbing now.Reading this book aloud right after finishing The Honest Truth has been magical. My students have made so many comparisons between the two books, and you should have heard the collective gasp when we came across the title of the book in the story.Dan Gemeinhart is a master of suspense woven with Truth woven with humor.

His mother, his sister, his father, and now his beloved horse, who's all he has left. But, unlike his family, he can get her back. With surprising grit and determination, Joseph sets out after her, along with a Chinese boy with his own mission, these two trek countless miles through the wilderness, facing bears, Indians, and dangerous men, all trying to find the only thing that will complete their hearts: family. Told in Joseph's voice that's real to the time, these is an adventure of epic proportions that will have readers turning the pages until the end. I really enjoyed this story. Joseph's grief felt real to me, and I can definitely understand how much his horse means to him. I own horses myself, and I'd do the very same thing if someone took my girl away. This author has talent. Not only is he able to describe the location brilliantly, he also knows how to make the reader feel exactly what the characters were feeling. I could feel Joseph's desperation to get his horse back, his anger at the men who took her, his angst at another disappointment, it was all very real. Not only could I feel what Joseph was feeling, but also Ah-Kee.This story will keep you guessing. With twists and turns that you didn't see coming, you won't be able to turn the pages fast enough. Above all that I find great about this story, is it's memorable. If you follow my reviews, you'll notice me mentioning about this. For me, the biggest thing for me about a book is it being memorable. That I will remember the characters long after I've read the book, and it'll make me want to come back to it. You will never forget this story and its characters, I can guarantee that.All in all, amazing book that will definitely be reread for the years to come!"}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21548465-kristen", "userReview": "I loved The Honest Truth, but I wasn't super excited for this one because the two genres it falls under (historical and adventure) are not usually ones that I gravitate to. I thought I would try the audio version and am glad I did--it was great.The story is full of non-stop action and lots of emotion. Even if I wasn't 7 months pregnant I would have been reaching for the tissues (I recommend you keep some nearby). Joseph meets so many interesting characters on his journey to find his only remaining family member--his horse, Sarah--and there's a theme of what exactly things like \"home\" and \"family\" mean.

I can see a lot of kids relating to the adventure, of a boy who has lost everything going after the one thing he has left. I am left uncomfortable by the multicultural aspects of this book. I think that, at this point in time, if you are in children's literature and just going to use the term \"Indian\" without naming a tribe, then you're not doing enough. There is enough backlash and blogs to let you know that's not cool. If it had just been the pony, I think I would have been fine. However, I am skeptical that he wouldn't know a tribal name. Ah-Kee also left me uneasy, but I would be willing to concede that point if someone familiar with Chinese-Americans said it was fine."}, {"userName": "KC", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7582369-kc", "userReview": "Set in 1890 Washington, 12 year old Joseph Johnson has nearly lost everything.

I can't believe I loved this middle school book designed for 8-12 year old children so much! I chose this book because I love the cover and I needed a book with a title that didn't go horizontal for a challenge. As soon as I finished it I purchased it for my two granddaughters, ages 9 and 14...siblings. The 14 year old takes horseback riding lessons and works for her lessons every Saturday. I know they will both connect, even though the book is designed more for my 9 year old. The story follows and orphan named Joseph whose horse was sold by the man who is now supposed to be taking care of him, and Joseph sets out on a journey to find \"[his] Sarah,\" no matter what it takes. He would/and did go to the ends of the earth to try finding her. I am an emotional basket-case right now because this story completely tore at my heart over and over and over again. This is in True Grit style, I guess you could say. It's during the day of cowboy and Indians. And Joseph took off on his own with nothing but a gun really, not even a horse. He didn't care because he was after the ONE thing he had: his Sarah. Along the way he found an unlikely friend, encountered a Grizzly (and what an exciting scene), horse race competitions, white waters, killing, and just a book that will tug at your heartstrings. I don't care that it is easy to read, uncomplicated, geared toward a younger audience, it is an amazing book with a story that will stay with you a very, very long time, if not forever (as I believe it will with me)!Mr. Gemeinhart, if you ever read this review I just want to say THANK YOU for a book/story that has real meaning to it. It's truly quality throughout! Wow! I just followed you on Amazon. LOL Thank you so much for writing this. I can't wait for my granddaughters to read it.Recommendation: PLEASE! Read this book and share it!!! I'm a grandmother and recently retired school teacher, and I am going to make sure my ex-colleagues know about this book, even though I taught high school.

I have a review, which was my very first review and it is very embarrassing, you can read it, but I wouldn't recommend it. Anyway, I'm still amazed at how he managed to create a beautiful coming of age story. It became one of my favorites of last year, so I was eagerly anticipating his next book. Some Kind of Courage is quite different than his first novel. It is a western historical fiction, but still a wonderful, adventurous coming of age story. I adored the writing style in this book. The book is narrated in first person point of view from Joseph's point of view. The writing in The Honest Truth was simple, but the simplicity was what made it beautiful. In this book, the writing has a western feel to it which goes with the time period of 1890. The characters had a Southern accent and I could clearly imagine them talking. If I ever decide to reread this book, I would definitely go for the audiobook.Despite being a historical fiction, the time period that takes place is not one that many would know about. The 1890s doesn't necessarily depict a pivotal time in history, it's mostly forgotten. However, there are many important topics brought up that I was not expecting. The premise seems simple enough. A boy goes on a journey to get his horse back. Dan Gemeinhart really does dig deep into a dark and serious place. He brings up the topic of racism back then, specifically how people treated people who were Chinese or any person of color. They were handled in a tactful way and I enjoyed the addition of those aspects.The main character, Joseph was not an outstanding character, by any means. He's respectful and brave, a little too generic, but I didn't hate him. Mostly, I loved the friendships he developed with the other characters. His companionship with his horse, Sarah was so sweet and even we didn't see much of Sarah, you could tell how loyal the two were to each other. Additionally, there is another friendship Joseph develops with a character that really one of the reasons for my high rating. The two couldn't understand each other since they both spoke different languages, but they understood each other on a different level. The friendship they developed was loyal and strong. Who this character is, I will leave the reader to discover on their own.I did have a small issue with the fact that the story followed a similar format to the author's previous book. It didn't bother me that much but there could have been more of a distinction. Overall, I would recommend checking out this book solely for the writing or the friendships or just the entirety of it. Dan Gemeinhart knows how to write incredible stories, and I will be picking up his future books.

He's been mistreated, but the final straw is that Grissom has sold his horse, Sarah, to the equally horrible Ezra Bishop. Joseph takes his father's gun, the money Grissom got for Sarah, and a few provisions to which he feels entitled, tells Grissom what he's doing, and runs away. Before he gets too far, he meets a Chinese boy who has lost his relatives to disease and who seems unable to leave the town. Without speaking his language, Joseph invites the boy, whose name is Cheng, to join him on his journey to find Bishop and retrieve his horse. Joseph understands loss, since his mother and younger sister both fell victim to diphtheria. It's not a bad idea to have a companion in the wilderness in the Northwest territories in the late 1800s, and the two boys face grizzlies, bad weather, \"Indians\" and plenty of evil doers. Cheng eventually finds his father, and Charlie finds not only his horse, but a home along the way. Strengths: This was the best kind of historical fiction-- fast paced and interesting with lots of good details about what it was like to live in a certain time and place. Joseph's situation is certainly one that would have been common, and the inclusion of a variety of horse dealers was something new. Weaknesses: I very much appreciated the way that diversity was dealt with. This is an extremely tough call with historical books, and Gemeinhard struck a good balance. The terms and descriptions of the Chinese immigrants and the Indians are very true to the time period, and Gemeinhart goes out of his way to talk about the approved terms for the Chinese and how Joseph thinks that they should not be treated differently from other people. Because the author is not an enrolled member of a Native American tribe, however, I am concerned that the depictions of Native Americans will not meet with approval. The tribe dealt with is named as the Wenatchi.What I really think: I was not a fan of The Honest Truth, so wasn't thrilled to pick this one up, especially with the unattractive cover. This also just about lost me in the first couple of chapters, and when Joseph went on and on about his mother and sister. STILL, in the end I was completely engrossed in Joseph's journey, was glad that he ran into helpful people, and was relieved that he found a suitable situation at the end.

It's my new favorite pick for the 2017 Newbery. It's got everything - action, adventure, survival, love, loyalty, heart, courage, hope, grit, friendship, honor, and a horse. What more could you ask for in a story?! It's also a journey story with a reluctant hero. My favorite kind. I laughed, cried, sat on the edge of my seat, and didn't want it to end. I loved how Gemeinhart skillfully dealt with the outlaw's demise in order to keep Joseph's standards for himself intact. I also loved the friendship between Joseph and Ah-Kee. A friendship that was forged and fought for even without a common language. I've never read The Honest Truth - it's one of those Scholastic Book Club books that managed to make its way from the box into kids' hands without me ever getting to read it. My students would read it, wipe away their tears, and tell me I HAD to read it! I brought it home this summer so I could finally do just that, but I managed to read this one first.
