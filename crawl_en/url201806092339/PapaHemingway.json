But Hem was a friend, and The Code dictates you don't stab friends in the back, even dead ones (although Hemingway himself often did, both living and dead friends). So what we get here is Ernest Hemingway at his best and, perhaps, life at its finest, with adventure, lovely women, good friends, good food and drink, beautiful surroundings and honest fun. It's life as we wish we could live it--at least until the pleasure gets sucked out of it for E.H. and he kills himself. So what if it isn't historically faithful? What it gives us are the high spirits and high life of living large. It is a bible on how to live, albeit with a tragic ending that in no way diminishes the beauty of what preceded it.

Basically, it is a memoir, by the journalist A.E Hotchner, of his friendship with Ernest Hemingway, from the late 1940's to his death in 1961. The structure is very smartly done- each chapter is headed by not only a new year, but a new location, as Hotchner often traveled with Hemingway on his exotic adventures. Thus, you can read 4 chapters and read about them go from Havana to the Keys to Paris, and then to Madrid for a bullfight. Each chapter offers a more complex view of Hemingway than a jacket cover- a man of enormous vitality, but also of black moods and self destructive tendencies. With every hunt, fishing trip, bullfight, and hike, we see Hemingway unravel, then build himself up, and finally, in 1961, grow so depressed that he takes his own life. This book is not a tribute to Hemingway, but the actions of his amazing life point clearly to what kind of man he was."}, {"userName": "metaphor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5685453-metaphor", "userReview": "I felt I should get to it quickly now, and I did, but I said it very gently: \"Papa, why do you want to kill yourself?\"He hesitated only a moment; then he spoke in his old, deliberate way. \"What do you think happens to a man going on sixty-two when he realizes that he can never write the books and stories he promised himself?

Hotchner started out as a young journalist who was assigned to interview Ernest Hemingway. He didn't want to do it. He felt he was much too unimportant a person to be bothering the great writer. Flying down to Cuba where Hemingway was currently living he sent him a note explaining his situation and also that he understood that Hemingway probably didn't have time for him.What he received was a phone call from \"Papa\" himself inviting him to a restaurant for dinner and drinks. Thus began a fourteen year friendship between the two men, ending only with Heminway's death. It does not include anything that happened before Hotchner knew him and only includes personal transactions between the two authors.Hotchner quotes a lot of the conversations verbatim. Hemingway apparently did not talk in complete sentences. This may give an authentic feel to the story but it makes for rather stilted reading. I'd rather he had paraphrased.Having read Carlos Baker's unflattering biography about Hemingway it was interesting to compare the two. Because Baker in his biography calls Hotchner's biography unrealistic and fawning, I was prepared to read a biography that was biased.Maybe it was, but I felt that Hotchner was fairly honest about Hemingway's foibles, even if he did leave out or soften some facts that would make Hemingway a less sympathetic character. Mostly it is the story about a man the author obviously has great affection and esteem for. For whatever reason, Hemingway, at least from Hotchner's telling, took a liking to him and did not treat him in the shabby way he treated a lot of people.Even so, I still don't find Hemingway to be all that nice of a person in Hotchner's biography. Most of it is centered around Hemingway telling Hotchner what sound like tall tales, but even if they're not, they are still rather boorish renditions of what a tough guy he was. (\"There I was in WWII, beating up the enemy single handedly...\")The story travels along from Cuba to Spain to Africa, back to Cuba and also the U.S. a few times. Each place Hemingway lived was defined by how he conquered powerful animals . In Spain, he is obsessed with the bullfights. Hemingway never was a bullfighter but he became close friends with bullfighters and seemed to live vicariously through them.In Cuba he fished Marlin from his boat the Pilar. In Idaho he hunted bears and in Africa he hunted all sorts of big animals. I don't understand the psyche that pushed Hemingway to be such an avid big game hunter. He also enjoyed destroying people, although that does not come into this biography. What drove him to do it? Where did this cruel streak come from? Hotchner does not answer these questions. Baker's biography provides more clues.Hotchner doesn't answer perhaps because he didn't see it. Or maybe hooking on to Hemingway helped promote his own career. Certainly writing a biography about a famous writer you were personal friends with guaranteed getting known.Throughout the book Hotchner refers to Hemingway as \"Papa\". I wonder how the moniker started. It comes across as a little contrived and denotes a kindly, gentleness that was not a part of Hemingway's character.But perhaps he was a \"papa\" to some people. Hotchner seemed to view him so and so did others. Who Hemingway showed that side to appears random.The last part of the biography describes Hemingway's mental deterioration. Other biographies describe Hemingway's mental illness, but Hotchner gives a first hand account, allowing for a more accurate diagnosis. This book was published in the sixties so different names were used but I think that \"paranoid schizophrenia\" is how it would be described today. Hemingway became convinced that the FBI was out to get him, that they had bugged all his phones, and if any friend disagreed they had been \"bought\" and crossed over to \"their side\".Hemingway was admitted into a mental hospital at different times towards the end of his life and according to Hotchner was released against Hemingway's wife and also Hotchner's advice. In the end Hemingway was able to divert everyone long enough to pull the trigger. Hotchner wrote this biography soon after Hemingway's death.In conclusion, if you are a Hemingway fan, this is a good biography to include in your library. It is written with the warm affection of someone who knew Hemingway personally and carried on a close relationship with him in his old age, when he had once again invented himself, this time as \"Papa Hemingway\"."}, {"userName": "Jimmy Scharpf", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4016306-jimmy-scharpf", "userReview": "Not your typical biography. This bio does not tell the story of Hemingway from birth till death in a distinctive timeline. It is written by A.E. Hotchner, one of Ernest's closest friends. It recounts events that Hotchner and Ernest shared together, many grandiose tales that define who Hemingway was and how he built his larger than life persona. Epic stories that are hard to believe actually happened, certifying Hemingway as the ultimate \"man's man\".

The way the Mayo Clinic treated him in his final weeks of life (sending him home even though his own wife knew it would be the end of him) was horrific. Granted, this was nearly 50 years ago, but stunning nonetheless. I always thought of Hemingway as a depressed alcoholic and never realized how deep his mental illness and delusions were.

I was put off at the outset by the author's 1999 new preface (in the edition I read) which takes, in my view, a low blow at Mary Hemingway, airing his old man's petty gripes with Hemingway's widow, who, conveniently enough, was dead and unable to refute his remarks. Reading further, we learn that because the author was denied access to correspondence with Hemingway, he re-created, if you will, what he remembered of the correspondence, (for legal, i.e. copyright reasons) in the form of conversations with Hemingway. So how much of it was true? Who knows.I found it hard to believe that the 48 year old world famous author becomes a buddy (for the last 14 years of his life) with a twenty-something attorney/editor - travelling, fishing, drinking, etc. At no time in the book is there any mention of what the author was making off his adaptions for television of Hemingway's works. No, their \"friendship\" was pure, unsullied by commerce, and the author only lived to serve the master. But most disappointing was that the decline of Hemingway and his suicide is not sufficiently examined and worse, comes across cold and detached. I would have thought that someone with a ringside seat would have been able to comment more thoroughly on this - did Hemingway express remorse or regret for the life he had lived, a fear of death, self-pity? What's left is the thought, on the part of this reader, that Hemingway felt he couldn't party like he used to, so what was the point of living? Could anyone have been that shallow? Shouldn't the author have been more interested in motivation? More interested in trying to help \"Papa?\" Was the author feeling guilt at not having done more to help? Two of Hemingway's wives were still alive at the time of his death, yet the author reports almost nothing about them; only a stray remark or two about them from Hemingway. So how close could he have been to Hemingway? Or did Hemingway really let loose about Martha and Hadley, and the author had to hold back for fear of litigation, so that this \"inside\" look at Hemingway is worthless?"}, {"userName": "Wayne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1466146-wayne", "userReview": "Oh dear!Ernest is a bit of a bore and I've only waded to the end of the first chapter!!!!I certainly don't doubt the sincerity of his biographer, A.E.Hotchner, and it will be because of him that I will plough on in whatever form, whether skimming or picking out bits and pieces.I decided to read this, languishing on my shelf for the last 40 years, because my love of Paris led me to read EH's \"A Movable Feast\".That was another disappointment, but I was prepared to do a bit more research before pointing the bone.

Hotchner was dispatched from New York to Havana by Cosmopolitan Magazine to do a story on Hemingway. Hotchner was in awe of the famous writer and tried to dodge the assignment. Well, it didn\u2019t work and even as he was intimidated by the thoughts of how Hemingway would dismiss him without so much as a hint of a story, he screwed up his nerve and initiated the first contact. And from their first meeting at the Floridita Bar in Havana, to Hotchner\u2019s dismay, the two connected. A true friendship ensued and Hotchner traveled to Cuba at least once a year and communicated frequently by letter, wire and phone. Papa Hemingway called him Hotch and Hotch was as close to Papa as anyone. During their general conversations apparently very few subjects were off limits. Most of Papa\u2019s personal problems were discussed; he even talked about some of his writing techniques. Travel was a big part of Hemingway\u2019s life. He paid regular visits to New York, Paris, Madrid, Key West and Ketchum, Idaho. Spain was his favorite destination and the Spanish lifestyle was reflected in his writing from \u2018The Sun Also Rises\u2019 to various short stories.There was no one thing in this book that defined the Hotchner Hemingway relationship unless you consider brotherly love.

The book is well-written, but the self-parody Hem had become by this stage in his life deserved some insightful analysis not an attempt at a Moveable Feast in the nightmare years.

Hotchner into his inner circle. They traveled together, including raucous and risky forays into the bull-fighting ferias of Spain (once Hotchner even was goaded into acting as a matador in an actual bullfight), fishing the waters off Cuba Papa had prowled seeking U-boats, hunted in Idaho, ran with the bulls in Pamplona, and more. For fourteen years, Hotchner and Hemingway shared their thoughts and careers with Hotch acting as agent and representative. As Hemingway reminisced about his childhood, recalled the Paris literary scene of the twenties, and recounted the many real events that lay behind his fiction, including The Sun Also Rises, The Old Man and the Sea, and For Whom the Bell Tolls, Hotchner took it all down. What may have made this book controversial at the time is the final act. This part seeks to unravel why Ernest Hemingway took his own life, shooting himself at his Idaho home while his wife Mary slept. Hotch blames growing depression over the realisation that the best days of his writing career had come to an end and bolsters this with noted conversations and a couple of previous suicide attempts.

I've known a few bits and pieces about Hemingway, that he had been married couple times, lived in Cuba and Florida, traveled the world, and that he had a drinking problem. This book, with its plethora of detail about the man, helped fill in the gaps between those things and flesh out the man that we all know a lot better. A.E. Hotchner was a journalist and writer, and he met Hemingway in the late 1940's. They quickly became friends, and this book chronicles the friendship between the two of them that lasted all the way up to Hemingway's death in the sixties. They traveled the world together, having many adventures and Hotchner saw Hemingway in all of his ups and downs. In this book, you see all of the flaws that made Hemingway such the complex person that he was. The drinking, the fighting, the relationships (and how quickly Hemingway would end a relationship).The complexities in Hemingway's personality and life is such an interesting tale, and it's what makes this book so good. You want to keep reading it, because there's so much detail about this complex man. There's no glossing over of the facts, Hotchner doesn't paint Hemingway as anything more than he was: a complex man with many flaws and many strengths.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in the man that Hemingway was, beyond what he wrote and what the stories he told.

Many of the stories told here are not surprising. Most who are familiar with Hemingway and his work will not be surprised to learn that he liked to fish, drink, make love, and go to bull fights. On the other hand, the Hemingway fan will get a better insight into what made Papa tick and just what led to his ultimate destruction.The biggest drawback that I found to the memoir was that Hotchner sometimes introduces people without explaining who they are to the reader. That is fine with more famous people, like Ava Gardner and Gary Cooper, but there are other people who have a close relationship with Hemingway who just appear in the book without any introduction. I found this to be off-putting and frustrating.Despite this major flaw, I found the book to be helpful in allowing me to know who Hemingway really was as his friends saw him, and I found Hotchner's ending to be poignant, touching, and even a tad motivational. I was also impressed with the obvious influence Papa had on Hotchner's writing style.

Hemingway reminisced about his childhood, recalled the Paris literary scene in the twenties, remembered his early years as a writer, and recounted the real events that lay behind his fiction. And Hotchner took it all down. His notes on the many occasions he spent with his friend Papa - in Venice and Rome, in Key West, on the Riviera, in Ketchum, Idaho, where Hemingway died by his own hand in 1961 - provide the material for this utterly truthful, profoundly compassionate bestselling memoir of the Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author. What emerges is an extraordinary portrait of a great writer who had, and determined, the time of his life.", "title": "Papa Hemingway", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10791.Papa_Hemingway", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1322677932l/10791.jpg", "reviews": 104, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2937536.A_E_Hotchner", "name": "A.E.
