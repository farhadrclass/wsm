The plot was full of twists and turns, this kept me interested and made for a few times of continued reading. The characters could have been real people. I might try and get the rest of these books because the characters really drove the story. I was impressed that this story was easy to read; but had some very deep thoughts."}, {"userName": "Kristine McCord", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10962891-kristine-mccord", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this prequel. I'd read Bait first, so it was cool to go back and get this story, since I'd gotten fond of the characters and had been curious about Liam's relationship with Andrea. As a side note, I've grown picky about suspense since I don't like a lot of blood and gore or super disturbing mental imagery these days. So I found this book did a great job giving me a good story with enough suspense to keep me hooked while still not blindsiding me with too much disturbia."}, {"userName": "Caitlyn Santi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6980753-caitlyn-santi", "userReview": "My first time reading this author so I didn't know what to expect but I really enjoyed this novella. I liked the characters, and while there were many romantic moments (Mainly due to the Hero's desire to protect the heroine, which totally made me melt!) I did feel like it was a little bit too much of an insta-romance for my personal taste, but it didn't seriously affect my enjoyment of the story, especially because I'm sure that even though these characters aren't the stars of the next book in the series, there relationship will develop more in the subsequent books. I also have to say that while the ending was quite suspenseful, there was zero closure, but that was okay it just made me want to read the next book even more! Overall, this was a good novella which I enjoyed!"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8349937-heather", "userReview": "If you're thinking about reading Bait, I highly recommend reading this fast-paced prequel first. I read them in opposite order, but once I read Target I loved the characters and the story that much more."}, {"userName": "Sobia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2125909-sobia", "userReview": "Let me preface by saying this is really not my genre. I was in desperate need of a story to read, and a romantic suspense title seemed to fit the bill. It wasn't til after Id started that I realized this was a Christian fiction title. Now I don't begrudge anyone their genres ( or beliefs for that matter) but I don't like to mix theology in with my fiction. So, usually at the first hint of religiosity encroaching, I will abandon a book, but this time I kept with it (I'd already gotten a good deal into it!) ...and I'm glad i did, if for no other reason than trying something new. Okay,so...Would I read another? probably not, this really isn't my genre, it was alright in the begining, but got a little preachy for the second half of the book. Also the h annoyed me. She's described as distant and remote, and she definitely fits those descriptors. It was just very hard to like her ESP as she kept pushing the H away...then she sorta changed her mind, seemingly arbitrarily, and wanted forever with him instead. The H was pretty decent in the beginning, but sorta fizzled, later on. Also the h's FBI partner was a little too often center stage,.Also and I don't know how to explain it, but the theological discussions, some of,them seemed to just pop up randomly. And while most of the suspensey bits were decently written, though some bits didn't make sense, I'm not sure it warrant being called suspense. It was very light, IMO. Oh also because I'm a spaz, and don't pay attention, I didn't realize this was a novella. And a prequel to boot! Yeah so there's totally a cliffhanger. So 2, 2.5 stars maybe."}, {"userName": "Becky Avella", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4719140-becky-avella", "userReview": "This was a quick, entertaining prequel.

It's very short & sets the scene for Bait. When you finish this you will want to go directly to the next book.

I did have some problems with the story in that it seemed to progress a bit too much quickly and it seemed like there wasn't enough seriousness placed on the situation with the Chloroform killer. Putting myself in the story, I would think that there would be more terror and fear on the part of the characters; some of the lighthearted talk just wasn't in keeping with the somberness of a killer being on the loose.

Enjoyed the fact that Ms. Phillips does not go into gory details about the victims. Our minds can do that on our own. Characters are still developing in the story. Only downside is the high-ranking to the book. I like sequels but leaving the plot hanging is not the way to end the book. That's why my rating is so low.
