The only people who seem to keep a cool head are Karen, the prostitute with a heart of bitter gold, and Mad Dog McCall, an outlaw trapped in the city jail...Weird westerns have always been an easy sell for me. Know what's even better than a weird western? A FREE weird western!Gehenna is told in two parallel threads for most of the book. One thread follows Karen and the people at the saloon. The other focuses on Mad Dog McCall, an outlaw gunfighter who is locked up waiting for the Federal Marshals to decide his fate.The gore level is extremely high, I'd say four and a half out of five exploding zombie heads. Head explosions, flesh being torn from bones, and all sorts of moaner-killing goodness, which leads me to my favorite quote from the book:\"You keep calling them 'moaners'.\" \"Well, they moan. A lot.\" \"But the best you could come up with was 'moaners'? What about 'the living dead', or 'the eternal hungry.'\" \"I'm shooting them in face, not writing a book.\"The ending was really similar to the ending of Those Poor, Poor Bastards but there are only so many ways you can escape a tiny western town crawling with moaners.The writing was a cut above what I expected, especially from a self-published book. Brant did a good job making me care about characters I knew were doomed to be devoured before the story's conclusion.No complaints, especially since I have the second installment primed and ready to go. 4.5 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Mr. Matt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15984059-mr-matt", "userReview": "Gehanna is a western. It has dusty old western towns, trains, cowboys, saloons, whores, and, oh yeah, zombies. I really could end the review right here. It was that fun. The book kicks open the door, blasts a few zombies away, and then hauls you out of the chair and throws you out the door.It is the story of a zombie outbreak in the Old West seen through the eyes of outlaw Mad Dog McCall and the snarky prostitute Karen. What is great about the story is that this, I imagine, is exactly how the Zombie Apocalypse would truly begin. There is no back story about how some science experiment went bad, or how some ancient curse finally hit. Nope. None of that. One minute all is well in this sleepy little town and the next minute you have hordes of shambling dead eating their way through town. And of course, the infected join the horde as soon as they succumb to the strange illness.A solid four stars. The action is all over the top, but it works. This book reads like a big budget Hollywood movie. Think amazing stunts, big explosions and a massive body count. A fun, short little story."}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "Freebie.

The narrator didn't really do it for me but that may have something to do with the fact that the last story I listened to was told by the incomparable Will Patton.The hero is mad dog McCall, a suitable name for a gun slinger on the run from the law and currently situated in jail when things start to go awry. There was a small smattering of mad dog\u2019s history but that was more to prove that he really is a good guy with good intentions.Karen is the obligatory whore, pretty as a wagon to coin a phrase, with plans and a secret stash to get out of town with, unfortunately she\u2019s left it a touch too late as the living dead flood the town.I do like horror westerns but I\u2019ve got to say, I\u2019m not a massive lover of zombie fiction. There\u2019s only so many ways you can describe the living dead chewing flesh from some poor souls neck and again how many different ways can you inflict the fatal head injury that\u2019s going to stop one from trying to eat you.http://paulnelson.booklikes.com/post/..."}, {"userName": "Editing Services by Cynthia Shepp", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7897829-editing-services-by-cynthia-shepp", "userReview": "Jason Brant did not disappoint. Gehenna is a book like no other I have ever read. Zombies, prostitutes, and cowboys in the old west\u2026who would have thought of that? Well, apparently Jason did, and boy did he do it well. This book grabs you from the very first page. The characters are well thought out, the ride wild, and the losing your lunch optional, though I almost lost mine.The very beginning starts off like so many historical romances, believe it or not. The first few pages leave you totally unprepared for what is only a few pages away. The main character, Karen, is introduced as a smart prostitute in a brothel. The brothel owner, Ellis, is berating her for scaring off customers. He tells her, \u201cYou got to be the worst hooker I ever had\u201d as well as, \u201cI knew I should have taken those books away from you. Women got no place learnin\u2019 from those things. Nothin\u2019 good comes from it.\u201d You can tell it is all bluster because he treats his girls well, and has a soft spot for Karen. He was actually one of my favorite characters.I love Karen. She is just my type of girl. She is smart, knows what she wants and will do anything to get what she wants. She does not believe that she has to have a man to survive. She is her own person and she is one of those girls that kick ass. Most of the characters are introduced in the first few pages and then the excitement starts with screams heard from the street. You know that this is not just some historical romance from then on out. The people in the saloon notice that there are two people eating a woman outside. These people are not just ordinary men as they both had multiple arrows sticking out of their bodies and of course, they are EATING a woman!Right after that, another main character is introduced. He is \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 McCall, an outlaw that is in jail. In this part of the book you realize that guns are outlawed in Gehenna and by then you are really glad you don\u2019t live there. McCall is a great mix of outlaw/hero.There are also many biblical aspects of this book, but it was like no part of the bible that was ever pointed out to me. I will give you one clue: Leviticus 26:28. You will never think about zombies again in the same way, I promise you that. I do not want to spoil the whole book but I am going to point out a few things. In the old west, there were no such things as zombies, so in this book they have no idea what in the hell is going on. They have no guns and are totally unprepared for these \u2018Moaners\u2019 that are eating and changing everyone. The scenes are so realistic that you will literally shudder with horror when you read them. I have never read such a graphic book, nor have I ever read one that I had to put down while I was eating like I did with this one. The twists and turns are astonishing. Jason makes you think about the book long after you are done. The ending is like no other. I could not believe it was over with the twist that was just thrown out there at the very end. I am hoping for a sequel or this book is going to haunt me forever. It is just that kind of book. All in all, this book is a non-stop, action packed adventure. It is a must read!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5637391-sara", "userReview": "A read in one sitting excellent ebook..great main characters,good scenes and pacey action..thoroughly enjoyed!"}, {"userName": "Hayat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6116230-hayat", "userReview": "A Free book full of cowboys, outlaws, prostitutes, zombies, a drunk priest who serves as the town doctor and a hero and heroine to die for! What more could you ask for?An epidemic of biblical proportion is about to hit the old Wild West and when it does everyone is caught unaware and ill prepared to battle the hungry zombie horde.  When two cannibalistic, gravely wounded men stagger into the town of Gehenna, all Hell breaks loose. Infamous outlaw Mad Dog McCall, stuck in the city jail, must fight for his life to escape. The lonely, intelligent, and snarky Karen must make horrific sacrifices to survive the night against the growing army of the dead.This gem of a book has an intriguing mixture of wild west with Zombies but it works! The plot is fast and exciting, the side characters are entertaining, the main characters are well developed, engaging and seeing the world from both POV was a such a treat! The little spark of potential romance between Mad Dog McCall and Karen gives hope for their future survival and happiness. These two have won me over in such a short space of time and I'm going to be so heart broken if they don't make it to the end. Now I'm off to read more adventure/horror and see what mayhem and madness waits for the characters I'm fast becoming fond of."}, {"userName": "Elle Casey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7158387-elle-casey", "userReview": "If you like zombie stuff and John Wayne, you'll *really* like this book. I admit to being a zombie newbie (so not cool, I know) but I'm an old hand at westerns, both books and movies. Jason Brant's strong suits are the way he weaves humor into the story, despite their dark nature, and also his character development.

This is the first book by this author that I have read, and I was not disappointed. I am a big fan of zombie stories. There may be more out there written with the twist this one is written with, but if there are, I haven't read them. Oh, and I wouldn't recommend eating while reading this book.Gehenna is a place of eternal torment and suffering, the place of condemned souls. It is hell. There is an old west town by the name of Gehenna. The old west meets zombies. There are your usual characters from the old west \u2013 a bartender, some prostitutes, a preacher/doctor, the sheriff, a deputy, the outlaw, plus the other townspeople. They are well-developed and very believable.These two men wander into town. Well, they aren't exactly men, but they used to be. Each of them have arrows coming out their backs. They really shouldn't be able to walk at all. But they have walked into town and they are eating this woman alive. No one knows what a zombie is. No one understands what is wrong with these men who should be dead. No one realizes that each person bitten will turn into a zombie.While all of this is going on outside, there is an outlaw locked up inside the jail. Things start to get really interesting for him when the sheriff is no longer around and the 'walking dead' begin to come after him. He escapes and teams up with a prostitute in a boarded-up saloon to try and save their own lives from these extremely hungry monsters, the likes of which they have never seen.The preacher/doctor with them begins shouting out how this is the punishment of God upon this city for its sins. That is kind of funny once you realize that he is one of the city's worst sinners.Besides taking place in the old west, there is also a biblical twist added to the story. I'm not going to tell you what it is, but it will make you view zombies just a bit differently. The twists and turns in the plot make you not want to put the book down. The action pretty much never quits. If you are a fan of zombie fiction, this a book that you really want to read.I bought my copy of this excellent book from Amazon.

Gehenna could not have been simpler and is written with a sparse, direct style that will have no-one comparing Brant to Laird Barron or John Logan, but it is all kinds of fun.Brant wastes no time in dropping a group of disparate characters into the midst of a zombie outbreak. The short novel is structured so as to be written from the alternating third-person limited perspectives of the two major characters - an intelligent prostitute working out of the town's bar and a gun-slinging bad-ass who happens to have been locked up by the town's sheriff as the story begins. There's also a host of cannon-fodder characters (who may as well be wearing bright red shirts), but they are simply there to facilitate moments of carnage - moments that Brant describes in great, gore-soaked detail. I didn't even care that several of them became interchangeable after a very short period of time.In short, Gehenna is a fun, survival horror set in the Old West. It won't win any literary awards, but it will have you swiping through the pages quickly. And Brant has had the good grace to turn this into a three book series which I am totally on board for. How about you?4 Kerosene Lamps to Set Alight for Gehenna."}, {"userName": "Zaz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15972406-zaz", "userReview": "A nice Weird Western, mixing well alcohol, pistols and zombies.When people rush out from the saloon, they discover 2 men eating a woman in the street. They succeed to restrain them, gathering some bites during the fight. And yes, hell is coming.I've a nice background of zombie books behind me, so for this part, the book was fine with lots of guts, gore, groans and missing parts. The tension was good, especially with the characters who didn't know what was happening, doing debutant mistakes. I haven't read many westerns and I'm not in a cow-boys country, so I've no idea if this part was good, but the list checked the essential things like weapons, the annoying preacher, the lazy sherif, the whores and the drunks. The lack of current technology was an interesting idea mixed with the zombies, giving a nice horrific atmosphere to several moments.
