Noting against this book per se."}], "description": "Looking Into Trees is the latest collection from the pen of eminent Canadian poet Douglas Lochhead. Drawing its inspiration from time spent looking \"into trees, between trees, around trees,\" behind the poet's house, the collection evokes the wonderful mystery of trees and the way they confront the contemplative viewer. For Lochhead, the ever-changing landscape of trees, their shadows and lights, reflects life itself, the great changes and the small details. Lochhead presents looking into and between trees as a continuing surprise; every hour, every second is different, as light changes and wind moves, leading to reflection on the moods, events, and phases of human life. Lochhead's human world is intimately interwoven with its landscape. The work is illustrated with details from paintings by Kenneth Lochhead, the poet's brother and one of the Regina Five group of abstract painters who were so significant to the development of Canada's fine arts tradition.", "title": "Looking Into Trees", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6885290-looking-into-trees", "average": 2.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348193951l/6885290.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/441964.Douglas_Lochhead", "name": "Douglas Lochhead"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3082749.Kenneth_Lochhead", "name": "Kenneth Lochhead"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6885290-looking-into-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3055944-love-on-the-marsh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3055946-cape-enrage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3055949-breakfast-at-mel-146s", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249518-millwood-road-poems", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3055948-reader-lover-of-books-lover-of-heaven"]}
