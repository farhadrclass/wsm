This was simply an ok, easy read, 3 stars-- while there were some beautifully written passages, at the end of the day, I'm not sure how much I cared about these people and their issues.The book was divided into three sections-- present day Karena searching for her brother, past when Kerena and Charles were children, and present after the big reunion. The middle section was definitely the best written. You did feel how devasting his illness was to the family. However, in this section was also the \"BIG EVENT\", which simply didn't resonate with me as a BIG EVENT.\" It felt like the author needed a BIG EVENT to make the story work (while in reality, having a sibling with a mental illness should have been enough of a BIG EVENT on its own), but I didn't find the BIG EVENT believable.Much more believable would have been finding out as adults that they didn't hit Motorcycle Man at all-- that he had fallen off his bike during a tornedo all on his own and they had nothing to do with it. I mean, what kind of idiot rides a motorcycle during a tornedo anyway? There is no way that two teenagers would have been charged with vehicular homicide for hitting someone stupid enough to ride a motorcycle during a tornedo, a fact that the adult Karena should have know. On the other hand, if they believed that they had killed him, and spent the next 20 years carrying their secret, only to find out that they hadn't, THAT would have been a compelling story.I was also troubled by the idea of having to keep Charles' illness a \"secret\". The story began in 1988, not 1958, yet the characters acted like it was, well, 1958, worrying about people gossiping and having to keep things \"in the family.\" I lived in a small town and even in 1978, people weren't really that interested in other families' business, so that rang false for me."}, {"userName": "Laura Droege", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4845018-laura-droege", "userReview": "I first heard of The Stormchasers while researching comparative titles for my book proposal. (No, I\u2019m not published, but I still needed to know what other novels dealt with similar subject matter.) So I picked up a copy from the library and devoured it in a few days.Karena, a 38-year-old news reporter, has been searching for her missing bipolar twin brother for over two decades. When she gets word that he has been hospitalized, she is both relieved (at last, she\u2019ll see him!) and fearful (has he tried to kill himself again?). But by the time she makes it to the hospital, Charles has disappeared again. Karena believes that he may be with a group of stormchasers, people who \u201cchase\u201d severe weather in search of tornadoes. So she joins a stormchasing tour, chasing after her missing (and unmedicated) brother, and soon finds love, bad weather, and the truth about her darkest secret, the one that only she and Charles know.I really enjoyed this book. The portrayal of Charles\u2019 bipolar disorder is accurate, and having been on lithium myself, I can appreciate his hatred for the side effects of his medications. Having been a friend to an unmedicated bipolar person, I can appreciate Karena\u2019s dilemma, too: Charles being medicated is hell for him, Charles being unmedicated is hell for everyone else. It\u2019s frustrating and scary. The book is worth reading."}, {"userName": "Melissa Storm", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4257833-melissa-storm", "userReview": "Can you imagine the strange incompleteness one must experience when carrying-on life in the absence of her twin sibling?

And, oh yeah, he left her after a catastrophic event tore them apart\u2014a secret they keep sheltered from the rest of the world.One day, Karena receives a call from an unknown hospital three states away. Her brother is being treated there. Karena rushes to the hospital, feeling a rush of excitement, fear, and longing\u2014only to find that Charles has been discharged. This close brush stirs up feelings that she had long attempted to suppress.Settling back into her normal routine would now be impossible. She has to find Charles. But where is he?Karena reasons that the best way to find Charles is to figure out where he will be going, not where he currently is. When manic, Charles chases storms; Karena joins up with a chasing tour, hoping that this dangerous path will reunite the long-separated twins.During this journey, Karena must confront her own fears associated with the adventure and her lingering guilt about the secret they share. She must also figure out what finding Charles will mean for her both practically and emotionally. Despite the risks to body and heart, Karena must find Charles; the gaping emptiness has been leading her life for far too long.\u201cThe Storm Chasers\u201d by Jenna Blum is a fantastic read. At times, readers will be tempted to pause and reflect upon the poetically woven passages. At others, they will soar along with the rhythmic, breathing storyline. The most compelling aspect of the novel lies in the juxtaposition of character development and metaphor.As Charles so aptly points out, he likes the storms, because he can relate to them. The parallel between manic-depressiveness and tornadoes is marked. Both can crop up from seemingly nowhere and leave destruction in their wake. Both are at the same time deadly yet beautiful to behold. They are enigmatic, energetic, and exciting. And so is this novel.Besides having the opportunity to read this fabulous book, I also had the pleasure of twitterviewing its author, Ms. Jenna Blum (@jenna_blum).

Although I enjoyed this narrative well enough at the beginning, the middle really dragged, and the ups and downs of reading about Karena dealing with obstinate Charles (the twin with severe bipolar illness) wore me out and ultimately bored me.Although the metaphor of stormchasing and bipolar \"storms\" was apt, the relentless reminder to the reader of how Charles' illness affected his sister, was overdone. I think most readers will be able to predict the outcome of the story once the \"secret\" is revealed. I did, however, enjoy the technical information about the development and science of storms, particularly tornadoes, since I live in the Midwest where this type of weather is common and often destructive.Another reviewer has remarked about the fact that the two men in the book rarely use Karena's name. Her brother (and twin) calls her either \"K\" or \"sistah\", and her boyfriend refers to her as \"Laredo\" or some other term. I also found that annoying. I really never felt that I got involved with the characters in this novel -- they were very one dimensional and I found myself becoming irritated at times rather than empathizing with their plight. I was basically just glad to get to the wholly anticlimactic end.I will wait patiently for Blum's next novel, and see if she can revert to the quality storytelling that made me a fan when I read her first book. Overall, just found The Stormchasers only mildly interesting, a bit disappointing, and would tell those who ask, \"It's OK.\""}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1879727-valerie", "userReview": "First off I really like the cover. Usually I don't think too much about them unless they are terrible, but I really liked that the sister is on the front and then if you turn it around the brother is on the back (and no faces). I appreciated that the book was set in the mid-west (tornado alley to be specific); an often neglected part of the US. The moment you start reading the book you know this woman has problems. Though she is successful in her job and money, her personal life is another story. Karena has been looking for her twin brother for twenty years. After a call from a from a Wichita Kansas hospital, on her/their birthday of all days, she is determined to find him. How? By chasing the storms -tornados that is- because of course her bipolar twin chases storms. Despite what that may sound like the book doesn't have as much tornado scenes as you'd expect and they weren't as exciting as I had hoped. It is mostly focused on the Karena\u2019s relationship with her brother, Charles, which is of course messed up. There is this huge secret that they both keep and something that Karena did to Charles that she has regretted for 20 years. The book is set up in 3 sections: 1st- looking for Charles; 2nd- Karena's and Charles's past; 3rd- the aftermath of finding Charles. The first part wasn\u2019t very entertaining though you\u2019d think it would be with storm chasing and a romance going on. The romance was pretty fast and I didn\u2019t like it. Karena is all for keeping the fact that her brother is bipolar a secret from the people she chases with. \u201cThis is family business\u201d she remembers her dad saying and I thought yeah this makes sense; it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business what your personal life is. She keeps from telling anyone\u2014for three days\u2014and then she caves in and tells Kevin. By the end of the week everyone in the crew knows about her brother, way to keep it a secret Karena. Also she and Kevin hook up by the end of the week after two meaningful conversations. My only complaint is, why so much build up? They waited sooooo long before they got together. I know she tried to build up the relationship thoroughly before doing anything unwise like sleeping with someone you just met but seriously she waited six whole days! If you couldn't tell I'm being sarcastic.Now the other secret that is major she keeps under wraps much longer, maybe too long. The middle section of the story I enjoyed the most, which is when the reader finds out what the major secret is. The relationship between Karena and Charles is as realistic as I can imagine with a bipolar disorder in the mix. It\u2019s darker than I had imagined but I learned more about the bipolar disorder. There are parts I could feel for both siblings and their mother. There is some cheesy dialect but overall the writing was great. And last but not least the ending, I may be spoiling but I don\u2019t think so. I wasn\u2019t not satisfied, but I\u2019m big on endings. Meaning, I like happy endings. And you would think on how it turned out she would be happy but she\u2019s not, not completely. It was like things are all right, but they will never be any better than that. Karena can never truly let Charles go it seems; she has to be near him all the time (within driving distance that is). I thought I was close to my siblings but they are really close. I could appreiciate their relationship."}, {"userName": "Erika Robuck", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103117-erika-robuck", "userReview": "When The Stormchasers begins, Karena Jorge is turning 38, but in spite of her newspaper job and close friends, her life feels empty. She feels the vacancy of her separation from her bipolar, storm-chasing twin, Charles. Before the day is over, she gets the call she\u2019s been anticipating for years\u2013a psychiatric ward in Kansas contacts her looking for the family of a man who has just checked in. Once Karena is able to get to the hospital, her brother is gone, but she is determined to find him. Karena convinces her newspaper to send her on assignment with a group of storm chasers for a story, while she searches for Charles.From the danger and thrill of chasing tornadoes, to the beginnings of a love affair, Karena gets more than she bargained for at every stop. When her past collides with her present, she finds that the only way around the storm is straight through it.I read The Stormchasers in four nights. Blum\u2019s descriptions of turbulent weather are riveting, frightening, and invigorating, and her family narrative is every bit as rich. The setting and plot are unique and unpredictable, and the ending is very satisfying. Blum does a brilliant job of giving characters redemption without letting anyone off the hook, which to me, makes the best kind of ending.While Blum\u2019s earlier novel, Those Who Save Us, was very different from The Stormchasers, both utilize a split time period narrative structure, memorable characters, and descriptions so clear I envisioned them as movies while I read. Blum is fearless and unflinching in her writing, and it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s an internationally bestselling novelist. She penetrates the heart of what it is to be human, to make choices, and to face the consequences of those choices head-on.Fans of Jodi Piccoult and Caroline Leavitt will love The Stormchasers.

I immediately thought of the movie Twister, a movie that I love, and I had hoped this book would be similar in plot and action, unfortunately my hopes had been dashed. I was disappointed in the delivery of the action sequences. I felt Jenna Blum was a little lackadaisical in the description of the tornado/storm chases. I felt a little let down in some parts, because I wanted more. The feeling of being thrilled or something like that. However, what Blum did do right was present a really compelling look into the mind and life of someone who suffers from a bipolar disorder. When Blum narrated Charles manic episodes, that's when I got that feeling I was looking for, but missed when reading the storm chasing parts. I wanted to feel like I didn't know what was to come, but couldn't wait to get there, well that's how I ended up feeling. Charles was an intriguing, but sympathetic character. He was my favorite overall... He may be crazy, but I loved that about him. As I already said, I thought some parts were slow in the beginning when they shouldn't have been. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprise at how much I ended up liking and enjoying this book, especially the relationship between Charles and his twin sister Karena. Starting in the middle to the end is when I really got sucked into the story. I cried a few times and felt frustrated and anger at others. I have always felt an author succeed when a reader feels emotionally connected.Don't be put off by my not liking that the actions parts weren't there, because the story is rich with other kinds of action and it had a vividly descriptive and haunting narration that will captivate you..."}, {"userName": "David Sullivan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4745369-david-sullivan", "userReview": "Here's my review that I posted on Amazon:Storms are such an apt metaphor for this well-written novel that moves along as if caught in a tornado's cycling winds. There are the actual storms, brought to life with descriptive prose, full of color, fury and passion. Then there are the storms between characters, brother and sister, children and parents, boyfriend and girlfriend. And finally, there is the storm that rages in Charles' head, electric synapses firing in unpredictable sequences, connecting thoughts that do not appear logical and leading him to destructive behavior, both to himself and to others. I found this unifying metaphor to be very satisfying as a reader, it helped me to make connections among nature, human behavior and relationships, none of which are ever completely under our feeble mortal control. The lesson of this book is, in one word, humility, in the face of that which is much bigger than any of us. The sooner we accept that, the more at peace our life will be.

I have never been particularly interested in the weather or bi-polar disorder. Furthermore, these topics seemed like a massive undertaking to merge into one cohesive novel. However, I am really trying this year to read things outside of my normal reading comfort zone and broaden my horizons with new genres and authors. Because Goldberg McDuffie has never lead me astray before in the books they have asked me to read - I decided to take a leap of faith with this one. I couldn't have been more pleased with the result.The Stormchasers follows the difficult history of twins, Charles and Karena. As children, the two were close and often Karena was the only one who could reason with Charles as his dark moods descended. As the twins get older, Charles moods become more erratic and dangerous. He often resorts to using hateful words - slinging them like venom at those he loves the most - and physical strength to get his way. The one thing that soothes Charles more than anything else are the massive storms that roll through southern Minnesota and its neighboring states. Throughout the book, the behavior and structure of the storms becomes a symbol for Charles. At times, he is calm and relaxed, but within moments things can take a very nasty turn.This book also has so many complex layers; it is about far more than just storms and bi-polar disorder. The book also takes a hard look at buried secrets and the issue of trust in relationships. Also, many times in literature, being a twin is painted as this beautiful picture where you're other half is your best friend and support system. It was interesting for me to see a different picture painted in this book. As much as Karena loves her brother, he drains her and complicates her life at every turn. She has to learn to balance her love for him with the need to be able to live her life without constantly worrying that one of his episodes will result in her losing everything.I also enjoyed the way the book was structured. The beginning is set in the present day as Karena is frantically looking for Charles after not being able to locate him for twenty years. She wants to take care of him and make sure he is safe. After receiving a call from a hospital in Kansas, Karena takes off on a storm chasing adventure in the hopes that she will find someone who can show her the way to her twin. The trip proves to be more enlightening than she could ever imagine as Karena finds herself enamored with the storms and her attentive guide, Kevin.The second section of the book takes the reader back to 1988 on the day of Charles and Karena's 18th birthday. It is on this day that their lives will be altered forever and part of why the two go their separate ways for so long. This section of the book was my favorite. Life is full of choices and often these choices lead us to do things and keep secrets when we know that we are in the wrong. I have always felt that in certain situations I would always do the \"right\" thing, but this portion of the novel made me think about how others might be lead down a different path.The last section of the book brought the past into the present as Karena and Charles are still dealing with the incident from the evening of their 18th birthday. The storms in their lives have reached the point of the most destruction, but can they calm the winds and rain to salvage something good for themselves? Can they save their relationship after all the hurt and betrayals? Jenna Blum is an amazing writer who truly took me into worlds I have never been to before and made me care about them. She also brought forward two characters that will stick with me for quite some time, but they weren't perfect. I appreciated that. The beauty of Karena and Charles is in their flaws - the messy parts they hide from view. Beauty comes from chaos. This novel is written like a storm - it grasps you and refuses to let go until all the energy has been seeped into the very last period. I look forward to reading other works by Jenna Blum in the future.One Last Gripe: I wanted to know more about the Motorcycle Guy. Who was he? Why was he out in that storm?My Favorite Thing About This Book: Karena's redemptionFirst Sentence: Karena Jorge's birthday starts as a quiet affair, but she doesn't mind.Favorite Character: KevinLeast Favorite Character: At times it was Charles and at times it was Karena - I did like both characters so these were only fleeting moments"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/362843-jennifer", "userReview": "As a huge fan of Jenna Blum's first book Those Who Save Us, I was disappointed that this book didn't deliver the same impact as her first. And very surprised that the writing style is one of the major drawbacks. The plot is certainly compelling enough - Karena is searching for her estranged bipolar twin among the storm chasers of the mid west. Karena and Charles carry a dark secret that binds them as much as their twin-ness. A romance, a tornado, and a reunion all add to the fairly fast paced storyline. Some of it works (storm chasing is on my bucket list so I was happy to read about their adventures with nature) and some of it doesn't (I'm not one for everything to get tied up with a bow at the end - this was a little too easy, wasn't it?). But more distracting is Blum's incessant use of character names in the dialogue. When I talk to someone directly I rarely state their name - they know who they are! But Karena's storm chaser boyfriend Kevin uses his nickname for her, \"Laredo\", in almost every line of dialogue. I just opened to a random page and found three examples. This sounds like nitpicking but it was very noticeable and really detracted from the naturalness of the dialogue. And now that I've pointed it out you will be hard pressed to ignore it. Sorry. This book has a lot going for it as a fun summer read but if you are a fan of Blum's first book, go into this with reasonable expectations for a fun soap opera plot and a made-for-tv ending."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350236-sara", "userReview": "This book was written well enough to read quickly and was engaging enough that I wanted to keep reading. I loved \"Those Who Save Us\" and was expecting something great from Jenna Blum, but this is nothing like \"Those Who Save Us\" - not in writing style, type of story, nothing similar at all. I was really thrown off by that. I felt very distracted throughout this book. I don't know if it was Blum's writing style so much as her inability to convince me that she knew about bipolar disorder. I felt like it was being shoved down my throat that Charles had BPD. Karena seemed pathetic to me, too hard to either like or dislike -- I can deal with both in a character, but not ambiguity. The middle section was clearly the best. The Kevin character distracted me because he didn't seem genuine or real, and I never could get a picture in my mind what any of the characters looked like-it seemed to change based on different descriptions in the book.

Charles is a storm chaser, following tornados and equating them to the storm of emotions in his own head that his disorder brings him. Karena sets out to find her brother by going into the storms herself. All the makings of a good novel were there, but somehow it just didn't gel together as well as I had hoped.

Estranged for twenty years, Karena receives a phone call one day from a hospital that is treating her brother for anxiety attacks. Karena leaves her life in the Twin Cities to travel to Kansas to see her brother, so long missing from their family. However, by the time she arrives Charles has been discharged from the hospital and is gone once again. Karena explains to the doctor who treated Charles that anxiety is not her twin's primary diagnosis. Rather, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder decades ago and refused treatment prior to his disappearance.Karena's only knowledge of her brother's interests -- at least twenty years ago -- lies in the dangerous hobby of storm chasing. Desperate to see him and terrified of the affect the anti-anxiety medications Charles has been prescribed might have on his manic symptoms, Karena decides to join a storm chasing tour group under the guise of writing an article for the Minneapolis newspaper where she works. Karena falls for a guide on the tour, who has a long history in the storm chasing world, and who has met Karena's brother. Will Karena find her brother, and what will happen if she does?Blum sections the novel into three distinct parts -- the adventurous and suspense-filled storm chasing tour, then a mid-book flashback to 1988 when the twins turned 18 and faced adulthood, and finally a return to the present with the novel's denouement. The flashback threw me for a loop initially. I so enjoyed Blum's introductory pages, that I was stunned by the switch to, not just scenes from, but an entire section devoted to the twins' teenage selves. However, upon reflection I feel that the flashback and background story were an absolute necessity. Blum's transition was a bit too abrupt, but after a few pages I was once again entranced by her writing and deeply involved in the twins' 18-year-old issues.Bipolar disorder is an oft-discussed but highly misunderstood mental health diagnosis. Many people still think of and refer to bipolar disorder by its former name: manic depression. Having worked for several years in the mental health field, I was initially skeptical about an author's ability to translate the disorder realistically onto the page. Movies depict bipolar disorder as many things it is not, and a fictional book struck me as one more way the illness could be skewed for the public. However, as Blum states in the video interview below, she has personal experience with the disorder -- people in her life who have been diagnosed with this illness. Blum's words carry with them a truthfulness when she describes Charles's symptoms: days at a time without sleep, psychosis with auditory and visual hallucinations, grandiose thoughts and ideas. Each person diagnosed with bipolar disorder's experience is different, but Blum does an excellent job of describing at least some of the symptoms individuals with the disorder face.The novel is an extended metaphor of sorts -- Blum uses big storms as a way of discussing bipolar disorder. As she states in the interview below, bipolar disorder is sometimes described as an \"electrical storm\" within the brain, occurring when there is an abnormality in brain circuit structures and/or functions. The lightning of storms is similar to the misfiring of neurons that researchers hypothesize happens in the brains of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The disorder also is known for its cyclic patterns, both long and short. These cycles are mimicked by the tornadoes in the book. Blum describes Charles's initial diagnosis as cyclothymia, a slightly milder version of bipolar. The word obviously has links to the root word for cyclone, an alternate word for circular storms like tornadoes.Blum conducted years of research while writing The Stormchasers, including going on several storm chasing tours with the Tempest Tours group based in Texas. Storm chasing is not an invented hobby, but rather a serious method of research that scientists and meteorologists employ in the study of storms. The National Association of Storm Chasers and Spotters, headed by famous chaser Warren Faidley, partners with The Weather Channel and other media outlets to help alert the public during dangerous weather outbreaks. Discovery Channel also has a reality show which depicts the lives of chasers as they follow storms that pop up on the Great Plains, called Storm Chasers."}, {"userName": "Mookie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/829561-mookie", "userReview": "I love prairie storms. It's hard to articulate to someone not from the prairies what's so beautiful about miles of flat land, and overwhelming sky, and the dark clouds that encroach from the horizon. Jenna Blum writes in ways that is so tangent and real and she articulates perfectly the feel of summer road-trips and solo flights and sitting in empty parking of highway motels. You can taste the scenery. I will read this book over and over again for the descriptors alone.A lot of reviewers have mentioned they dislike Charles, and that the book would have benefited without him. I disagree, I think the storm-chasing was a secondary plot-point for a very good reason. Having a sibling with bi-polar issues, I thought the descriptions of Charles manic episodes was written bang on. Loving brother one day, malevolent force the next. Rarely laid back, you get the sense that he's always spring-loaded. There's an intense current that exists inside many people with 'mood' disorders, again like a summer storm crackling on the horizon, and I thought this tornado theme was an absolutely perfect metaphor. Blum might have hyped his mood swings a bit more than necessary. I think that a lot of readers who don't have loved ones with mental disorders might not relate to how absolutely hard it is for Karena. They might ask, why isn't she tougher? Can't she see that's he playing her? Can't she see that he needs meds? Why doesn't she lose him, he's a jerk. It's not as black and white as that. It's not that easy to cut out your only remaining family. I understand how your life can become irrevocably intertwined with that of a sibling. And medication comes at a great cost, and with my sibling medication completely shifted his personality and cognitive functionality. It really does play with how you view the fundamentals of your brain, and whether or not you should dim the lights down. So it was very realistic to see this intense guy integrating holistic remedies into his life, and native philosophies of mental mania, because a lot of people with these disorders do the exact same things to avoid turning to drugs. Really struck a cord with me. I think Karena did overreact to his rambling journal entries and pinned-up articles on the wall. I know a lot of artists that do the same thing.The person that bothered me the most was the romantic interest, Kevin. On one hand, I liked him immensely. There was just something endearing about this 'loafy' stormchaser always tugging down his shirt like a schoolboy. On the other hand, he was so irritating. As another review mentioned, there was no reason to call her 'Laredo' every other sentence. How many times do you call somebody by their name during a conversation? The dialogue could have gone a lot smoother without the nicknames. And I found it annoying how he lectured her all the time. It felt like in every conversation he would hold up a hand and say \"whoa, Laredo. Hold up. A, we can't do that, B, etc etc\". I get that he's a high school teacher but she's not a student. It was patronizing. He was way too overprotective of her in terms of her relationship with her brother, and at that point I wanted him to butt out. I also understand how he has 'trust' issues, but they've known each other for two weeks, she's not obligated to unload every deep dark secret right away. Aaand they started discussing kids names a wee bit early for my liking. Karena was so great away from Kevin, but when she was with him I felt she became a bit meek and pathetic. I think Kevin was written more as a bulletin brief of stormchasing facts, and Blum struggled with integrating him into a natural character. I like the idea of Kevin, but he wasn't well-written, and I couldn't get a good grasp of his character. Also, for the life of me, I can't envision what a \"pancake face\" looks like. I mean I can, but it's fairly comical.I think the relationships between Karena and both men felt a little forced, which was a shame because an easy solution to that would have been to get rid of them constantly addressing each other (Laredo, K, sistah), having them stop clapping each other on the back, cool it with the lectures, and the interactions would have been much more natural.I make it sound like this book was an awful read. Not at all! Very compelling, engaging story, with realistic people (although unrealistic dynamics), with an incredibly evocative landscape, of which I will read over and over again."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/417156-jenny", "userReview": "I don't remember hearing about this at all when it came out; I found it when I was in the stacks, and picked it up because I'd loved Those Who Save Us. This book, though entirely different in setting, is of equal quality. It is a story about 38-year-old Karena and her bipolar, tornado-chasing twin, Charles, told in four parts: Karena in July 2008; Karena and Charles in 1988, the summer after their senior year of high school; Karena and Charles in August 2008; and an epilogue, set a year later, in August 2009.Karena, a journalist in Minnesota, joins a tornado-watching tour to try to find her brother, who she hasn't seen in twenty years. Reluctantly, she reveals her mission to one of the tour guides, Kevin, who had seen Charles as recently as 2001. As they chase storms and Charles, the descriptions of the Midwestern landscape and towns are gorgeous, the descriptions of the storms evocative and awe-inspiring.The middle section gives the backstory, including a dark event in the twins' past. In the third section, Karena welcomes Charles back into her life, and the epilogue provides resolution. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but this is an exceedingly good book, one I hated to put down for any reason. The parallels the author draws between bipolar disorder and the storms that occur in nature are insightful and thought-provoking.Quotes:Memory is a trapdoor. (14)...Karena reflects as she often does on how strange it is that her twin's disorder is one of just this: moods, the shifting emotional weather healthy people take for granted. (22)And, always, there is Charles....Charles, the fact of her absent twin like a radio signal that's sometimes stronger, sometimes fainter, but one Karena never stops hearing.

How can I learn more to keep myself safe?\" (Kevin to Karena, 60)CG cloud-to-ground lightning (107)She resumes her contemplation of the land flowing by, the horizontal layers of blue sky, green grass, clouds. How to explain why it makes her heart leap, her throat hurt with wistfulness and longing, just looking at it? (123-124)Nature may be beautiful, but it is cruel in its extremes. (155)It is like being on a game show in a nightmare. (210)The amount of pretending she'll have to do exhausts her. And she's suddenly unbearably lonely, as though somebody has taken her by the hand and led her away from everyone else on earth. (230-231)They lie silently for a while, pushing at each other with their minds. Karena things of the axiomatic struggle they learned about in physics class: an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object. And she thinks, there must be a way out. (239)Time will fold over the past, if you let it. (256)It's Charles's disorder...the way it renders Karena unable to feel. The way it takes you by the hand, nodding and smiling slyly, and leads you back to the same old place every time, so just when you think everything might be all right after all, you come home and open a door to a room full of blood. (331-332)But if she had dreamed something, it might have looked like this....The knowledge that sometimes when you throw yourself upon the world, it will hold you up.

This was a fabulous read (and I'm not just saying that because I know her!)! I just couldn't put it down, and it reconfirmed my opinion that boy, can this lady write!Jenna not only explores the lure of storm chasing and all that is involved with tornadoes, clouds, wind, charts and the obsession some folks have with this. She also gives the clearest depiction I've ever read of someone with bipolar disorder. Having experienced this very thing with a family member, I can say that she hits the mark 100%. Layered onto this wonderful story is the familial relationship of twins and how they are mentally and emotionally connected.This is superior writing by a superior author.

Charles suffers from rapid cycling bipolar disorder. They have not seen each other for 20 years when Karena receives a call from a mental hospital in Kansas telling her they have admitted her brother. She rushes to the hospital only to learn that he had been released and the doctor there knew nothing about his bipolar disorder. Charles has always been obsessed with tornadoes, even when they were children. He has been taking off and chasing storms his whole life. He went missing after a terrible accident that occurred when he and Karena were chasing a storm. It is prime storm season and Kansas is in the part of the United States known as \"Tornado Alley\". If she is ever going to find her brother now is the time. She signs on with professional storm chasing tour group under the guise of her real job as a journalist writing a story about storm chasing. She hopes she will find her brother while touring with this group and get him the help her really needs.I was so psyched about this book. I loved the first part, learning about chasing the storms and the part where they actually got caught up in one and witnessed the aftermath. After that this book became very disjointed for me and a bit repetitive. It starts out in 2008, then goes back to the twins past, then back to 2008 and then ends with an epilogue in 2009 to tie everything together. Written this way the story seems to lose the natural flow, some of the relationships seem forced and not believable. The ending seems rushed and again unbelievable. It seems people either loved this book or feel like I do. This is my first Jenna Blum book and this may be her writing style and it just isn't \"my cup of tea.

Since I started reading it to say I was hooked would be an understatement. I'll admit the first thing that intrigued me was the whole stormchasing concept. I've watched the Discovery Channel's hit show \"Stormchasers\" and had the reaction of \"How could anyone in their right mind do this\"? The second thing was the whole twin angle of the book. As a mother to twins myself I've always been fascinated with the concept of \"twindar\" and wonder if my children will admit to experiencing this later in life. And thirdly, I was intrigued that one of the twins is Bipolar. Both my father and sister have been diagnosed as Bipolar and while my parents have been divorced for 30 years and I have no recollection of his manic states, I have been witness to my sister's. There was one point in the book where Charles is Manic and ranting to Karena regarding their mother and I put the book down and went \"Oh My God\" because almost word for word of his rant was a rant that my sister had regarding my mother. I even went so much as to call my mother and remarked that for this book being fiction the author was right on. She must have done some extensive research into the subject.In the end I enjoyed reading this book immensely. I felt like I read it in a whirlwind (no pun intended). I liked the character of Kevin but the only thing I found disturbing was Motorcycle Guy. Did anyone else think that perhaps the tornado killed him and they just ran him over in the melee? Perhaps I missed something, I mean I know about the mirror but the experience they described regarding hitting him seemed like it was a bump (like he was run over) more than clipping the motorcycle. And really? Would someone be out chasing storms on a motorcycle?

Its hard to have such a wonderful book, (Those) and then to have to have any others be compared to it. But I rather enjoyed this. I found the characters interesting, the portrait of bipolar disorder right on the mark, as well as the portrait of Stormchasers, and the connection between. I found the description of twinship and responsibility interesting and compelling. I liked her, the main character Karena, felt for her circumstances, and wanted to root for her. I found their shared family history and interesting one as well, and it begged a question. Not so much how far one would go to protect a sibling, but more apt to the point, what does it take to have responsibility for another, outside of the self, and how are those decisions made? That question was for me, a theme that resonated throughout the book. And made the ending make sense. We need each other and we need our separateness. How do we exist between?

Somewhat, because while she is clearly a fantastic writer, a second novel is often either disappointing or a near-replica of the first book. Authors who continue to write the same book over and over bug me, and so I can thankfully report Blum is not among them. However, I did not love this book like I did the first.This is a modern-day story, of Karena and Charles, twins who grew up close but were separated after high school. Charles is bipolar, and as a child of the '70s and '80s, is never properly medicated. He rages against his disease, his parents, his surroundings, while at the same time discovering a love and sort of kinship with tornados and the giant storms that bring them on. Of course, bipolar disease is a life-long battle, and Charles, though he shares a lot with his sister, is at the mercy of his illness. The book chronicles Karena's search to find him (by joining up with a storm chasing group), then goes back to their childhood together, then fast-forwards back to the present again. I thought there might be many more twists and turns to this story than there actually turned out to be. If you are from this part of the country, you will recognize many of the towns and stretches of interstates that Karena travels, as well as the markers of bad weather. At first, I rated this book a three, but because it was good enough to be a page turner and an easy read, I scootched it up to a four.
