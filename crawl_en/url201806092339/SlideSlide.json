What a very difficult book to rate. I'm still not sure I made the right decision.The thought at the forefront of my mind when I finished Slide is that this author should have written realistic fiction about relationships and the psychology of the characters, rather than a mystery. I truly thought that the explorations of Vee's relationships with her father, her dead mother, her sister, her friend and her ex best friend were excellent. I took something memorable away from each and found the messages about forgiveness and moving on to be very poignant.I also think that Vee is an excellent protagonist, one I could like and understand - even though she is unlike me in many ways. The way she learns to cope with her gift (or curse) and then eventually to control it is told very well. She has made many mistakes in the past and they have shaped who she has become, but she has used each one to improve herself and has learnt from them that popularity isn't worth the price of turning herself into a heartless bitch.All this was excellent. But the mystery - for me - was very lacking. Yes, I didn't manage to guess what was happening, but I thought that was more because the truth was so very far-fetched, rather than a demonstration of how well the author concealed the mystery. When a mystery is unveiled, I want to go \"oh yes, of course, it all makes sense now!\" not \"eh!? really???\" I felt like the conclusion came from nowhere and I wasn't particularly impressed.And another reason this author would be better suited to realistic fiction - I wanted an explanation for Vee's strange ability to slide into other people's bodies. A random paranormal element in an otherwise real-world novel just seems weird and out of place here. It felt like an attempt to be original that went wrong. The sad thing is that the author didn't need to write a paranormal novel, she didn't need to write a mystery, because Jill Hathaway obviously has a talent for getting inside characters' minds.I want her future novels to focus on people, relationships and personal issues. Then I will gladly read them."}, {"userName": "Reynje", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5590906-reynje", "userReview": "[I really have no point of reference here on the US high school experience except for late 90s/early 2000s teen movies (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "Slide is a refreshing, fast paced YA mystery that has original paranormal elements along with great character building; a very quick read that I would recommend to all fans of thrillers. Vee is able to \"slide\" into someone else's head when she gets these fainting spells. This is when she figures out there's a murderer on the loose. I loved this sliding ability. It's original, clever, and it can make for some serious amusement. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't elaborated more thoroughly, though. Curiosity gets the best of me and I want to find out why, how, and the purpose of these paranormal elements in books. Where do they come from? How did they get it? Who else is affected? When these bases aren't touched it simply feel out of sorts in an otherwise contemporary novel. Regardless, I still found it fascinating as it took us into the minds of several characters, and essentially enforced them with personalities. I've been reading murder mysteries since I was in my early teens. I have always loved them - one of my favorite series was Veronica Mars (still sad it was cancelled). Consequently, I've developed quite the talent of figuring out who's guilty, so in my case I thought it was fairly predictable, but I wasn't too put down by it. I was still kept constantly entertained, mostly by the characters' relationships and family dynamics. Jill's ability to write well rendered characters and their relationships is what I enjoyed the most in Slide. We've got very deep, emotional issues that are touched in this story. Absentee fathers, deaths (including suicide), bullying, affairs - she was able to create serious life problems that are dramatic, but also deeply realistic. It's incredible the way Vee deals with difficult situations she's thrown into. I loved her relationship with her sister the most. Being basically the one raising her, she has incredible patience and maturity to stand by her, supporting her through all her rights and wrong. This is only one of the many reasons why I absolutely admired Vee's character. The mystery is fun, the characters are wonderful, and the pacing keeps you on your toes. Even though it didn't blow my mind, Slide is definitely a book I'd suggest for all fans of murder mysteries - a rare gem in current YA. --For more of my reviews, visit my blog at \nXpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Nomes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3842653-nomes", "userReview": "Slide is a refreshing, energetic YA debut for fans of Veronica Mars.Sylvia (Vee) can slide into other people bodies, bearing witness to what they are doing, but having no sway over them. It\u2019s pretty much a perfect premise for a sleuthing novel as Vee can sleuth her way around people minds (helping progress the plot forward with conveniently witnessed scenes).I liked Vee from the first chapter. She is funky without being try-hard. I loved her narration: She is my sister and my exact opposite in every way. If she\u2019s the pink glitter on your valentine, I\u2019m the black sharpie you use to draw mustaches on the teachers in your yearbook. It\u2019s pretty much a mystery story and the plot is expertly woven. The stakes continually rise (as does the body count). The red herrings are plentiful and really make for a page-turner.Set in a high school, type-casting* is initially used to set the scene, yet Hathaway (mostly) pushes past cliches to give all her characters depth, which I really admired.The climax is everything you\u2019d expect a climax to be in this genre: secrets are unveiled, past and present tragedies collide. I can see why it has already been optioned as it has all the drama and intrigue (and originality) to play out gorgeously on the big screen. It would make a fun high school flick, hey. As for the Big Reveal... nicely done. I guess I saw it coming when I was supposed to see it coming (?) and it was sufficiently daytime drama to give thrills but not overly melodramatic, still matching the tone of the rest of the book. I am not usually a huge fan of YA stories featuring cheerleaders, arrogant jocks, high school cliques and all the petty/vicious girl-warfare that goes down. But in Slide it was fun looking on. Vee is an ex-cheerleader and far removed from the scene (thankfully), it is through other peoples eyes that we get involved. Vee herself is a blend of gorgeously achey, pragmatic and funky. Her best friend Rollins is so much fun, a little bit enigmatic and a lot crush-worthy (hey, I am a fan). It\u2019s a fun story, dramatic in parts and sad in others. It also has patches of heart (particularly in regards to relationships: Vee and her sister, Vee and her best friend, Rollins (LOVED Rollins), and Vee and her father ~ he is a broken man and their relationship is tenderly handled). Vee and her sister, Mattie: Then I climb into bed and wrap my arms around her, pretending we\u2019re stranded in Antarctica and I have to use my body heat to keep her alive.  Recommended : I read this through in the space of 24 hours. I grinned a lot (some of Vee\u2019s narration is so likeable) and had a relaxed time reading it. This is a book for fans of YA mystery, Veronica Mars, high school stories and for those wanting an addictive story with a lot of energy in it. In terms of genre, it has the (paranormal?) premise, but it reads like a contemporary novel.  a solid 3.5 stars, perhaps teetering towards 4 as I did have an awesome time reading it...  *I like typecasting in plot-centric books. It\u2019s a great strategy with many strengths and Hathaway utilises all the strengths without falling prey to any weaknesses of typecasting (such as overusing cliches or creating one-dimensional characters)"}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "Slide is one of those exciting books that you can (and probably will) read in one sitting, and then gladly re-read it a year or so later. It is a fast-paced thriller with a single paranormal element. I was honestly surprised by how quickly I finished it and how much I enjoyed it. The idea of slipping into the minds of others is certainly not new or unexplored, but I liked Hathaway\u2019s version of it. Vee\u2019s ability can be defined as a form of psychometry \u2013 touching emotionally charged objects causes her to see things through other people\u2019s eyes. Vee has only tried to share her secret once, with her father, who promptly sent her to a psychiatrist and refused to talk about it again. That experience has thought her never to reveal what she sees, not to anyone \u2013 her sister, or even her best friend. I expected Slide to focus more on the romance, but the first half was practically romance-free, and I must admit I\u2019m glad that was the case. It allowed me to take the rest \u2013 the mystery, Vee\u2019s ability, her loneliness and her fears, more seriously and it gave the story more weight. By the time the romance came at the center, I was already fully invested in this page-turner and eager to discover the identity of the killer. In style, Hathaway reminds me a lot of Kim Harrington, which is a big compliment in my book, with one very important difference. Harrington\u2019s Clarity (or Perception), although equally long, never seemed rushed but rather perfectly paced, while Hathaway\u2019s desire to be concise worked against her.In the second half, things started coming together at a head-spinning pace. On the one side, this was good because there were no fillers, nothing to dilute the main storyline and as I already mentioned, I was kept on my toes the entire time. On the other side, though, it stopped me from forming strong emotional connections with the characters as there was simply no time to get to know them, and I was never given a chance to become fully invested in their relationships, be it father-daughter, boyfriend-girlfriend, or those between best friends. By far the most impressive and memorable part, at least to me, was Vee\u2019s relationship with her emotionally distant father. After Vee\u2019s mother died, the brilliant pediatric surgeon started working himself almost to death, avoiding home at all costs and leaving Vee to care both for herself and her younger sister. Although Vee is full of resentment and feels utterly abandoned most of the time, she can\u2019t find it within herself to stand up to him because he looks so utterly destroyed that her first desire is to protect him. Their reversed roles, their entire situation was done extremely well and it really struck a chord with me. To make the short story even shorter, Slide is a thrilling read perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon when you need something to fully occupy you for a few hours and then let you go in time for work/school on Monday morning."}, {"userName": "Temi Panayotova", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2101501-temi-panayotova", "userReview": "\u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0438 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0430 -

Slide defines what an awesome murder mystery novel should be like: twisting, original, somewhat creepy yet completely unexpected. I couldn't put this down until I was certain who the killer was, and in this rare case, it wasn't until the very end of the book! Fast-paced and enticing, this is the kind of novel you should clear your schedule for because you won't be able to stop! Not only is this one of the most surprising mysteries I've read to date (and as a girl who dreams of being the next Nancy Drew, I've read a lot!), but Slide also incorporates a really cool supernatural element too. Our fantastic, spunky, and pink-haired heroine Vee can slide into the minds of other people. She can literally see things from a person's eyes just by touching an item that belonged to them. Vee is such a multi-layered and realistically flawed character that I felt for her from the beginning, and connected with her even more as the story progressed. Each of the secondary characters \u2014 from Vee's little sister to her dad to her best friend Rollins (who was an amazingly genuine character!) \u2014 had their own little mysteries surrounding them, and that made it all the more intense to read. You also can't help but second-guess the incredibly sweet new boy, Zane, just because the sweet new boys are always suspicious. I bet that 99.9% of you won't guess the killer correctly if you were to stick with one person! My only wish is that the mystery could've been wrapped up a bit better because mysteries should be able to stand on their own (although that doesn't mean this end on a cliffhanger at all!), but other than that, Slide is definitely one of the better YA mysteries out there! ;) BUY or BORROW?: This book is a must-have for anyone who loves a great mystery \u2014 especially a riveting murder mystery with a cool supernatural element, awesome characters, and a twist at the end that will throw you off your feet! :) (Original review at Mimi Valentine's YA Review Blog)"}, {"userName": "Isamlq", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4016030-isamlq", "userReview": "[control the other.

I loved this book. Love, love, loooooved this book. Do you hear me, Jill Hathaway? I freakin loved your book, woman! :) Here's why: The writing....is lovely. It's done in a way that its easy on the eyes, and the reader is drawn in right from the start. The use of descriptive language is something that I always look for when reading a book, and this one....yes. Just....YES.Love the cover. It's trippy, is it not? Just like the main character, Vee's \"slides\". There is so much I wish I could say about this book, about the plot, the characters, and everything in between. But I can't. Why? Because I could give EVERYTHING away. And the whole awesomeness of this book is not knowing what's next. It's the mystery.Vee rocks. She's tough, she has pink hair (duh..that's cool!) and she's the only person that has an inside eye to what's going on. She's the fly on the wall that isn't really there at all, and she's hurting since the loss of her mother. The way this book is written makes Vee's loneliness so tangible. You can literally feel it as if it's your own.I want to say more. I do. I want to spill everything about the relationships between Vee, Rollins, and Zane, and the secrets that her father has, and the mystery behind who the killer is. And who is next. But...I can't. I just...can't. Maybe if you can slide into my mind, you'll know. I promise if you do, you'll go pick up this book.

There are things about this book that I really liked, and things that I either didn\u2019t like or kind of disappointed me.Everyone believes that Sylvia \u201cVee\u201d Bell is narcoleptic, but she isn\u2019t. Instead of falling asleep when she passes out, Vee slides into someone else, seeing the world through their perspective for a short time. The only person Vee has ever told about her sliding- her father- didn\u2019t believe her, so she keeps her ability a secret, even from her best friend Rollins. But her ability feels more like a curse, especially after sliding into the person who murdered Sophie Jacobs, Vee\u2019s little sister\u2019s BFF. Everyone believes Sophie committed suicide, but Vee knows the truth. So Vee sets out to uncover the identity of the murderer, but this proves difficult as she realizes that more than one person could have had a motive to kill poor Sophie. Things get even more complicated for Vee when she starts to spend time with the new hot guy, Zane and her best friend Rollins starts to act distant.Slide has a very intriguing and original premise, and I was truly captivated by it. Vee\u2019s sliding ability isn\u2019t one that I\u2019ve ever really read about before, so I found the whole concept refreshing and fascinating. I think Hathaway explores Vee\u2019s sliding ability in a way that gives readers enough information and backstory to understand Vee\u2019s mindset, without burdening readers with too many details or info, and yet, still leaving enough mystery about why and how her ability developed (is it genetic? did Vee\u2019s mom have the same ability? was Vee touched by some supernatural power? Etc) to keep readers enthralled.Vee is certainly a compelling character, but I did have issues with her development and characterization. Throughout the book, we learn that Vee was once a popular cheerleader and best friends with a girl named Samantha, but after one traumatizing sliding event during sophomore year, their friendship was ruined. Vee then changed- she died her blonde hair pink, she stopped wearing preppy clothes and started wearing Converse shoes and band t-shirts showcasing all the 90\u2019s grunge, alternative and punk bands she started listening to, and she started hanging out with Rollins. To me, Vee\u2019s transformation or rebellion is incredibly clich\u00e9. I get that Vee\u2019s character is trying to distance herself from the social group she used to belong to, and perhaps from the girl she once was, but I just feel like having her go down the \u201clook at me-I dyed my hair (insert color)- and now I listen to indie/alt/punk/non-mainstream music-cause I\u2019m such a rebel\u201d road is just unoriginal and kind of over done in YA. And this is coming from someone who pretty much dressed the same as Vee in highschool (honestly, I still dress the same- band t-shirts, Converse, occasionally multi-colored hair and all).But that\u2019s not to say that I didn\u2019t like Vee\u2019s personality, because I did; she\u2019s quite a complex and emotionally layered character. Hathaway does an excellent job of exploring the emotional and psychological toll Vee\u2019s ability, her mother\u2019s death, her role as caregiver for her sister and her father\u2019s emotional and physical distance has taken out on her. Despite her clich\u00e9 transformation and choice of rebellion, I did find Vee relatable and likable. And I did like that Vee\u2019s obsession with 90\u2019s music is given a very emotional and touching explanation.At the core of this novel, I think the story is about relationships- Vee\u2019s relationship with her sister Mattie; her father; Rollins and Zane, Mattie\u2019s relationship with her two BFF\u2019s Amber and Sophie, and others- and I did find myself really invested in several of these various relationships, especially the sister relationship between Vee and Mattie. Vee and Mattie have a very complicated, messy, fragile relationship that I found very believable, realistic, and at times, heart achingly poignant and beautiful.Rollins and Zane are very different, yet they both give Vee things (in an emotional and mental sense) that she needs. Neither guy wooed me, but I found them interesting enough.The murder mystery aspect of the story is not without its twists, turns and shocking revelations, but overall, I found the story predictable. I saw most of the major events and revelations (including the identity of the murderer) coming. I enjoyed the ride, but wish the final destination was more of a surprise. There are a lot of interconnecting subplots and stories, and overall, they come together cohesively and without continuity issues.I do want to mention that I think for some people- those who suffer from depression, self-harm, suicidal thoughts or tendencies- this book may be triggering. The topics of depression and suicide are often treated in a very cavalier manner by characters (students, school officials, police officials), and while I think this reaction to these intense subjects is pretty realistic, it may be too much for some readers.MY FINAL THOUGHTS: For the most part, I really liked the main character and premise of Slide, but the overall story, with its predictability and clich\u00e9s, failed to WOW me. But I will certainly be reading the next book in the series.

Slide is the story of Vee (Sylvia) who is diagnosed as a narcoleptic, but she really gets unconscious and slides into our people's bodies. She slide into a person's body just as they murdered her sister's best friend Sophie.  The whole idea of Sliding was very cool but it was very similar to [book:Wake|1661957. The pages flew by when I read Slide because of it's fast paced plot and skilled writing. I loved how it was a paranormal thriller and it really pulls the reader in.  The writing style was great and really pulled me in. Jill Hathaway is a writer that really writes characters well and their relationships. I couldn't connect with the characters at all because I couldn't relate to them. I love books when you feel like you could be in the character's situation but with Slide it wasn't like that. One of my favorite character relationship is Vee and her dad. Hathaway really nailed what a true father-daughter relationship is like. Vee's relationship with her dad and sister felt very realistic.I didn't really like the love triangle at all because I felt like it was just a distraction from the action and mystery of Slide. Zane and Rollins just didn't cut it for me, they just were not that interesting. Rollins seemed to be pretty inconsistent with Vee and he really annoyed me at parts in the book. Zane seemed like he was pretty flawless for almost the entire book and that really annoyed me because nobody's perfect.  Slide is a great read for fans of The Lovely Bones and Wake. I kind hope in the sequel that the reason why Vee slides will be explained or maybe we will learn more about sliding. Hathway created an intricate story that is filled with surprises that readers will devour. Also I love the cover and the book trailer!

The characters were fairly cliche and the story wasn't very good. But the last fifty pages made up for it.I was not a fan of the main character. I wanted her to stand up for herself more, but she never really did. She was the classic 'loner' in school and everyone thought she was crazy. She acted normal and 'didn't do anything to attract attention', but you know what I would have done in her place? If everyone at school thought I was crazy, being normal and not standing up for yourself wasn't going to change anything.I would have acted crazy. I would have plastered an insane grin on my face all the time, I'd wear weird clothes and be super overly friendly to everyone. I'd skip to class, I'd hum songs out loud and BE A LUNATIC.

Sometimes she can help it and sometimes she can\u2019t. When her younger sister\u2019s friend dies of a so-called suicide, Vee must put the puzzle pieces together to find Sophie\u2019s killer.This book wanted to be a thiller but it didn't meet the mark. It felt too formulated. The main character is a girl who is has traded in her \u201cglory days\u201d of popularity for pink hair and a bad boy best friend with a lip ring. She has a younger sister who thrives in the social limelight (read: cheerleader), a mother who passed away, and an always-absent -father. I\u2019ve seen it many times before in YA books and nothing about this particular situation made this book stand out in any way. This was a plot driven story and it just felt slow at times. The pacing went from slow to super fast and back to slow again then super fast. I felt too jerked around while reading this book.

I thought this was a standalone book however from further research, I saw that it does have a sequel, about which I\u2019m confused. This book had a wrap-up indicating a resolution and I\u2019m wondering why the author would created more conflict?Overall, this book just didn\u2019t feel original and that\u2019s something that I feel YA authors really need to strive for in a market where there are so many books.

It\u2019s something you gain. Death is always there, whispering in your ear. It\u2019s in the spaces between your fingers. In your memories. In everything you think and say and feel and wish. It\u2019s always there.Everyone knows Vee has a problem, they just don\u2019t really know what it is. Diagnosed as narcoleptic, Vee passess out on an increasingly regular basis. What everyone doesn\u2019t know, is that when she\u2019s unconscious, she slides. Vee finds herself looking through the eyes of other people, an unwilling passenger to their lives, unable to look away. When her little sister\u2019s best friend supposedly commits suicide, Vee\u2019s the only witness who knows the truth--Sophie didn\u2019t kill herself, she was murdered. Now, Vee is forced to remain silent for fear of being labeled crazy, but she is compelled to solve Sophie\u2019s murder and stop the killer before more harm can come to her sister.Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: Guy and girl are best friends, but their friendship is on the brink of unraveling because it\u2019s pretty clear that one (or both) of them has feelings for the other beyond friendship, but they\u2019re too wound up to actually talk about it and instead start pushing each other away. New guy comes to town and sees said girl as \u2018special\u2019, and is totally into her even though she\u2019s probably not hot/popular/his type enough for him and her life is completely screwed up right now, but he sees beyond all that to the unique flower that is her.Sound familiar? If so, you might find aspects of Slide as tedious and wrote as I did. But (yes, there is a BUT), I will tell you that luckily, this played out love triangle is a considerably minor part of the plot. For me, there was plenty more to Vee and the mystery and suspense of Slide to keep me turning pages at top speed until I reached the end, leaving me liking Jill Hathaway\u2019s debut much more than I was expecting to when I was about \u2153 of the way through.Thankfully, Vee Bell isn\u2019t just about the boys in her life. Vee is quite possibly one of the best big sisters I\u2019ve encountered in recent YA. She doesn\u2019t smother her sister, she lets her make her own mistakes (though let\u2019s face it, I did have that scene from 10 Things I Hate About You where Kat tells Bianca why she \u2018quit\u2019 being popular running through my head...they have just about the same dynamic), and yet she has her back and makes taking care of her when she\u2019s down her top priority. Of course, Vee doesn\u2019t see that she has a choice. Her mother has passed away, and her father is largely absent due to his job as a surgeon. Vee has pretty much shouldered the emotional responsibility of an adult twice her age, which is common for the oldest children in this type of family, but the fact remains that she does have the option not to take care of everyone around her. She\u2019s strong and she does, despite her own cavalcade of problems, and this makes her a winning lead.Of course, there\u2019s also the mystery. Slide was a fairly fast paced and thrilling read; Vee\u2019s affliction in which she passes out and \u2018slides\u2019 into others was both unique and terrifying. Vee is drawn into other\u2019s bodies through an empathetic connection made when she is touching an object with emotional significance to another person. This means she\u2019s basically become OCD, avoiding other people\u2019s belongings and used items (like books) with due care. When she does slide, she is stuck in that person\u2019s mind. She cannot read thoughts, control anything, or look away. As a result, Vee finds herself the only witness to a murder, and knows that if she ever tells she\u2019ll be labeled \u2018crazy\u2019 instantly. In order to appease her fears, Vee must learn to use her curse as a gift.Slide, for me, brought up some interesting privacy issues. Vee cannot really control when she slides, and despite her efforts to control who, often seems to overlook items that might direct her. She realizes the secrets she knows about people because of her affliction are a horrible invasion of privacy, and yet, she also begins to feel that it is okay to invade someone's privacy if you have good intentions. I had a hard time with this sentiment, although I could see the logic that brought her to this conclusion. As someone who values our privacy and freedom with the utmost dedication, I found it hard to stomach the notion that this type of \u2018spying\u2019 might be justifiable in order to make someone feel better. It does help to solve the mystery, but it's also no surprise that it blows up in Vee's face as well.I appreciated Slide\u2019s nauseating typeface on the cover, but will say that I was disappointed in the story\u2019s end. It just seemed too convenient to me. All in all, a take it or leave it kind of read. It went very quickly, and I enjoyed it, but I didn\u2019t have to have this book in my life. The concept for me was cooler than the actual story."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12248943-mike", "userReview": "[Amber's suicide.

Instead, when Vee loses consciousness it\u2019s because she has \u2018Slid\u2019 into someone else\u2019s mind and can see what they are doing. Unfortunately she can\u2019t control what they are doing, or hear their thoughts though.Vee has been coping with this problem by simply taking a lot of caffeine tablets, but the sliding is becoming more and more frequent. The only thing Vee can do to combat this, other than taking the caffeine tablets is to make sure she doesn\u2019t touch anything belonging to another person as this seems to trigger the sliding.One night Vee slides and finds herself in the body of someone with a knife in their hand, standing over the dead body of a girl that Vee recognises \u2013 her sister\u2019s friend Sophie.Who can Vee confide in though? Who would believe her? Or should she try to work out who the killer is on her own?This story had a very interesting premise, but it wasn\u2019t anywhere near as thrilling as the blurb suggested.Vee was a bit of a wishy-washy character. She had very few friends, and had no idea what to do with the information she had, so she basically did nothing. While this may be a realistic reaction to accidentally seeing someone get murdered, it doesn\u2019t really make for an edge of your seat thrill ride.This \u2018sliding\u2019 as Vee called it had been going on for a long time, several years it seemed, yet Vee had no clue what to really do about it other than to not touch things belonging to other people, and to take multiple caffeine pills (which as a friend pointed out \u2013 she took way too many of - to the point where she could have easily put herself into cardiac arrest). After at least 3 years of this sliding, you would have expected her to have tried to use her sliding in some way, or to see if she could slide into a specific person etc. only she seemed to have done nothing other than try to stop it. Again; not exactly a thrilling tale.Vee was obviously upset over seeing Sophie murdered, but for me, telling no-one was not the right thing to do. Especially considering that this was someone she knew fairly well, and someone that her sister knew even better.The murder mystery part was also a little dull for me. From the blurb I expected a gripping, thrilling mystery, and instead we just got Vee basically doing nothing other than speculating. There were a couple of likely candidates for the position for murderer \u2013 a girl who made fun out of Sophie, a guy who had had sex with her, and another possible lover too, but there was very little to go on, and no obvious culprit. By the 75% mark I just wanted to know already, and I was getting pretty tired of wondering who did it.In the end the murderer was not easy to guess at, but not for any clever reason, just because the murderer barely featured in the book at all. It was kinda like someone conversationally telling you at a bus stop \u2018they caught that killer you know; he lived next door to my best friends hairdresser.\u2019; mildly entertaining, but not exactly nail-biting.Otherwise the ending was okay, though not exactly happy, and like the rest of the story was pretty mediocre.Overall; a less than thrilling, paranormal YA murder mystery.6.5 out of 10."}, {"userName": "Ferdy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596358-ferdy", "userReview": "2.5 starsSylvia (Vee) has the ability to 'slide' into other people's minds, her abilities are triggered when she touches an object that holds some meaning to the person she 'slides' into. Vee has very little control over her powers and so she finds herself 'sliding' at inconvenient times, like when she is at school. Vee's family and friends believe she suffers from narcolepsy.Vee inadvertently 'slides' into someone who is holding a bloody knife over her sister's best friend, Sophie. When Vee finds out that Sophie's death is being labeled as suicide, she decides to use her powers to invesigate the murder. I did enjoy the premise of Vee's powers, she could see through other people's eyes but she couldn't read their minds or feel their emotions. I would have liked her powers and it's origins to be explored more, it was suggested that Vee's mother had the same abilities, but other than that, much of Vee's powers remain a mystery. I think it would have worked better if their were other people with powers, I hope that the sequel will expand on why Vee has powers and if there are other people like her.Vee was quite an annoying protagonist, she thought she was better than everyone else and she was also quite boring. I felt sorry for her best friend, Rollins - Vee expected him to do all the work in the friendship, whilst she did nothing. Vee got pissy with him if he didn't call, even though she made hardly any effort to call him or reach out to him. I really don't know why Rollins bothered with her.The love triangle was boring: Zane - the hot new guy, who much to Vee's suprise was interested in her and then Rollins - the BFF, who is secretly in love with Vee but for some reason has never made a move on her. Seriously enough with the rubbish love triangles!! I have to say, I was pleased to see that the love triangle was no more by the end and I do hope that there are no additional love interests in the sequel. Vee's dad and sister were not very likeable, I couldn't muster any sympathy for either of them. They both did horrible things and didn't think how their actions would hurt the people who they supposedly cared about. I was suprised to find out who the murderer was, it just came out of nowhere. I was disappointed that there was no confrontation or satisfying resolution with the murderer, it felt like the author couldn't be bothered and just decided to get rid of the murderer because it was easier to write. The girls in the book, apart from Vee are either 'slutty' or turn into bullies & heinous bit**es when some other girl 'steals their man'. I find it hard to believe that teenage girls would be that horrible to another girl just because said girl is involved with the guy they have a crush on. It's absolutely ridiculous and way over the top the way teenage girls other than the heroine are potrayed in YA novels.I did feel that a lot of the book was quite simliar to Kim Harrington's Clarity - Girl is an outcast, said girl has power, 2 guys interested in girl with power, random girl is murdered, girl with power uses her power to invesigate, girl with power gets in danger whilst investigating, girl saved by a love interest, bad guys are bad, mystery solved, the end."}, {"userName": "Ashelynn", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3428991-ashelynn", "userReview": "this review is also posted on Gypsy Book Reviews! disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange of an honest review.Slide has an interesting premise; I love that Vee is able to slide into other people\u2019s bodies, and then when she slides into a killer\u2019s body\u2026 dun dun dun. However, the execution behind the premise makes for a very predictable read.I liked Vee as a character. Her voice pulled me in right away and hooked me. However, as I read, the book sort of fell apart. Vee doesn\u2019t pick up on everything until the entire picture is pulled up, which annoyed me, a lot actually, because I figured out all the twists waaay before they came to light.The mystery is a bit clich\u00e9d and predictable. While I understand the killer\u2019s motivation, I didn\u2019t QUITE get it. REALLY? You\u2019re destroying peoples\u2019 lives over THAT? The secondary characters were a little blah, and seemed more 2D than 3D. The high schoolers sounded like high schoolers, but I didn\u2019t like Maddie and Amber at all\u2014especially for what they were doing to Sophie. It annoyed me immensely. If you\u2019re friends with somebody, you don\u2019t try to ruin them because they like a guy you like.I think readers are supposed to like Rollins, but I didn\u2019t. I hated his very being. We never really know why he was pulling away from Vee\u2026 and it was SO OBVIOUS he\u2019s in love with Vee (of course! In YA, there\u2019s always the best friend who is in love with the main character.)But I\u2019m SO TORN over this book. It hooked me right away and I read it all the way through in the same day. It was an emotional rollercoaster of liking it and being disappointed. I think what really did it in for me was the ending. I just didn\u2019t LIKE the motivation behind the killer.I will be reading the sequel, because that has a premise I\u2019m just so freaking curious about. I wonder how Hathaway will execute it."}, {"userName": "Farah Jay", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6521946-farah-jay", "userReview": "As I started reading SLIDE, I never expected to slide into a book full of a surprising and captivating storyline. SLIDE was definitely one of my most anticipated books of 2012, and I was so glad to get my hands on it. Jill Hathaway's writing was fun, and the flow of the book was good. I never felt bored, and always wanted to turn to the next page.The main protagonist, Sylvia, known as Vee, has a special power. She slides into people when she passes out, and when she does, she see's the world through that person's eyes. One day, Vee slides into a person, and that person was holding a knife, standing over Sophie's dead body. Vee witnesses a murder. While everyone believed it's a suicide, Vee was determined to find out the killer. Vee is definitely one of my favorite protagonists. She's very unique, especially with her pink hair. Vee and her best friend, Rollins have officially occupied a place in my heart. I just love Rollins; He's awesome, and I loved how Jill protrayed their friendship. It felt realistic to me, where they had their fair share of fights and misunderstandings.I love mystery novels, and one thing I look for in one is for it to surprise me, and SLIDE did a great job at that! I never expected the killer to be who it turned out to be, causing an induced mental slap but at the same time a huge smile on my face with how the book ended. Overall, I really enjoyed reading SLIDE. I especially loved the epilogue, and I just can't wait to get my hands on the next book of the SLIDE series! It is a mystery novel with a touch of paranormal that kept me hooked till the end!"}, {"userName": "Veronica Morfi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5510829-veronica-morfi", "userReview": "[Especially since it seems like she is going to end up with the BFF because the other guy is out of the picture by the end of this book.

Everyone has been told that she's narcoleptic, which excuses her random blackouts, but she knows that narcolepsy isn't her ailment. When she blacks out, she \"slides\"- goes into someone else's mind and sees the world from their eyes. It was random, at first, that she slid. But now, she's gaining control. It's because of this gift that she knows that the girl who committed suicide was murdered, and she was in the mind of the killer. With more than a few suspects in mind, Vee works to solve the murder, stop them from killing again, and on the way, digs up some family secrets.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was quickly paced and easy to read, which is always a plus for me. I liked that for awhile I had no idea what in the hell was going on- and I mean that in the highest of compliments. Just when I thought I knew who the killer was, a new kink was added to the plot, and I was left just as puzzled as Vee. I give it four stars out of five: I very much enjoyed the story, but I felt that the end was a bit rushed, and I wanted more details concerning Rollins. I felt that I never really got to know him, despite the brief look into his life.I recommend it to the teen/young adult audience, it's definitely worth a read."}, {"userName": "Isa Lavinia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016831-isa-lavinia", "userReview": "Slide I really, really hate giving 1 star reviews because I know authors work very hard on their books.
