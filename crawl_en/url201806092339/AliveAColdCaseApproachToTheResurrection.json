I left the book unsatisfied and disappointed."}, {"userName": "Godly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8820755-godly", "userReview": "A short book that covers some of the evidences that point to the authenticity of Christ's Resurrection event.

Overall worth checking out and when I get the chance gives me a taste of what to expect in Cold-Case Christianity (which until reading this book didn't have a ton of motivation to read). Looking at his arguments he gives some compelling evidence why many of the ideas Liberal scholars will take against the Resurrection are often found lacking when real world applications of how evidence is used in a crime scene investigation are used. If you compare this work to Ehrman (as an example, but as any Christian who has spent more than 10 seconds on the Internet knows, these arguments are everywhere) who often makes the claim that he's using the same logic one would use in a trial to make the case against the Resurrection one might find Ehrman's argument lacking (and not to go all fleshy/natural on this one, but who are you going to believe about solving a crime, a detective or an academic, wait don't answer that). That being said this little book is worth a look."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie", "userReview": "\"Alive\" is a short apologetic booklet that looks at the evidence surrounding Jesus' resurrection from the point of view of a cold case detective. What is the most reasonable explanation for the accounts found in secular, historical sources and in the Bible?The author explained his process and then examined the possible explanations using his experiences as a cold case detective. He did a good job of covering the various, possible scenarios surrounding the crucifixion and resurrection. His reasoning was easy to follow and logical. Overall, this would be a good resource for those who are uncertain about Jesus' resurrection and only have time for a quick read. It will especially appeal to those who are interested in detective work. However, this will be too brief for anyone wanting a thorough, deep look on the subject."}, {"userName": "Shane Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38943316-shane-johnson", "userReview": "Examining the evidence for the ResurrectionThis is a short book on how to examine and evaluate the evidence for the Resurrection.

As far as doctrines go, it's a game changer. Many accept the resurrection without giving it much thought. But isn't something so important worthy of our wrestling with it? What if we approached the issue of the resurrection in an unbiased manner and assessed it as a cold case detective would evaluate a crime scene? Author J. Warner Wallace is a cold-case detective. He also used to be an atheist. Follow along in this brief presentation of his approach in applying his detective's expertise to the accounts of the resurrection.
