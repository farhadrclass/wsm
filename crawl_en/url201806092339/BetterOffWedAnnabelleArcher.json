If I have to start a shelf for \"cozy mystery\" or \"was made into Hallmark movie\", and I start using phrases like \"he's a hoot and a half\", just fucking shoot me. I'm walking the razor's edge here with some of my questionable reading material lately. I blame the internet since I can't blame Obama anymore.Good times. I miss them.When you read a book a day, you become like a junkie. I use the library through Overdrive, get daily spam emails from freebie sites, troll the Amazon free offerings, am a member of bookbub, and may or may not check out some questionable places for books. Like all junkies, I have to whore myself out every once in a while too. New authors love book-whores. All of this is to say, \"I read this because it was free!\" Don't be thinking I'm turning into a cat-lady in a Snuggie who keeps tissues close in case the Lifetime movie makes me cry. NOT happening!As it should be. This book is cutesy. She's a wedding planner with a gay bff and a dumb/whore, but lovable, assistant. They find a dead body at one of the weddings they planned and enter Mr. Hunky Detective. Of course, sparks fly! But, she is warned to stay out of his investigation, and she keeps playing Miss Marple. She also has a cute old lady who lives downstairs because, well, that's the kind of book this is. Cute Old Lady loves \"Murder She Wrote\" (for you kids, that was a show where an old lady solves crime each week. If you ask me, SHE was a murderer, but whatever... seems awfully convenient that people kept dying around her. Just sayin'), and wants to help solve the murder by being nosy and trying to set-up our main girl with Detective Hunky.If only Detective Hunky decided to go for Grandma Nosy. THEN, we would have an original story here.Oh, the hijinx and hilarity! Mr. Gay Bestie is hilariously gay! Ms. Whore Assistant is sexy and dumb! Grandma Nosy is always showing up to nose around! Detective Hunky is flirty when he reprimands our Junior Detective Squad.Some things are just expected...If you like the cute chick-lit and cozy mystery thing, this book is for you. Lots of cute/funny going on. And, on that note, I'm going to go and read something either gory, smutty, or dark as a palate cleanse....Aww, that's more like it."}, {"userName": "Obsidian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian", "userReview": "Since I am pressed for time just going to say that I really enjoyed the first book in this series. It was everything you want a cozy mystery to be. Not gory, funny, and a cast of memorable characters.The main character is Annabelle Archer, wedding planner. When a demanding mother of the bride ends up murdered on the wedding day (can you imagine) Annabelle starts snooping though everyone tells her to give it up. Things I loved:I loved that this took place in Washington D.C. Apparently the author has visited or lived in and around D.C. She actually describes Georgetown, the Key Bridge, and Chevy Chase in accurate terms. I always get a kick out of books that take place in a city I commute to every day.Annabelle and her sidekicks (her employee Kate and her friend and caterer Richard) are hilarious. Plus all of the food Richard was supposedly making sounded delicious. Too bad no recipes though.Annabelle being a terrible at times amateur sleuth cracked me up. She definitely has a couple of memorable run-ins with clients and a photographer.The book was short enough that you didn't feel like it went on overly long. The writing was concise and the flow was okay throughout.Things I didn't love:Eh to the detective. I know that all cozy's must have a love interest (so it is written) but the detective was a big snooze to me.The next door neighbor was aggravating and not in a cute way. In a, too bad she didn't end up maimed way to me.There is no real why for why Annabelle starts investigating. In most cozy mysteries the first book (so it is written) the main character always is seen as a suspect. The synopsis says that Annabelle's friend Richard is considered one. However, he really isn't and I forget at what percent when the police arrest someone else."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870875-laura", "userReview": "I don't usually read this sort of thing, but they're written by a dear friend from highschool.

My disclaimer: I read Better off Wed  back in its first incarnation in 2005 when I both met Laura and acquired a signed copy of her book at the Malice Domestic Convention. She was at the convention having fun and promoting her debut book, Better off Wed , and I was there with my first and second books. As authors, we crossed paths. By the way, she\u2019s as delightful as her book. I read and thoroughly enjoyed my autographed copy ofBetter off Wed . Just this month, when I saw that she had revised the book and was putting it out there again, I got the new version via Kindle. I\u2019m glad I did. Of course in the ensuing years I\u2019d forgotten the ins-and-outs of the plot, so I could thoroughly enjoy reading it again. Laura Durham\u2019s main characters\u2014Annabelle the wedding planner and Richard the caterer-- are delights, both fresh, charming, intriguing, energetic. I particularly enjoyed the contradictions in protagonist Annabelle--outwardly organized and efficient, but with an apartment so messy that it borders classic Oscar Madison. She\u2019s protective of her heart and her career and both are at risk as the story develops. Richard the caterer is also a great character, smart, tart-tongued, and capable of great one-liner zingers. He is admittedly self-interested in salvaging his caterer\u2019s reputation, but very protective of Annabelle and a loyal ally as they seek out the truth behind the murder of the mother of the bride at Annabelle\u2019s big, break-through society wedding. The pace is fast, boom boom boom, no long monologues or pointless digressions in this tightly woven story. Durham\u2019s sense of place and world building are excellent and authentic, as well they should be given that she sets her story in her own world of Georgetown and Washington D.C.Definitely a cozy/romantic mystery with a dash of chick lit, but I don't count those as negatives when you want to just enjoy a fun, charming book. A delightful read\u2014or reread."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49714390-kat", "userReview": "FUN Read! If you like mysteries and want a quick read- this book is for you. Downloaded this book for free on Amazon and was not disappointed! Annabelle and her friends were an amusing and likable bunch.

Annabelle is an event planner in DC who runs into a murder and can't turn down an opportunity to play detective and gather clues with her friends Kate and Richard who are also in the wedding industry. I enjoyed the banter between friends while discovering clues and attempting to solve the mystery.

Always the bridal consultant and never the bride, she's seen her fair share of bouquet tosses. But there's no telling what surprises a ruthless killer will throw her way if she gets too close.Ok, so this was...well, to be completely honest, I'm not too sure exactly how I feel about it. There's definitely potential here, but at the same time I got really frustrated and annoyed with several of the characters.I really liked how Annabelle was trying to solve this, if only to clear Richard's name. Richard was mildly hilarious in all his minor freakouts, but some of them I was kind of confused about why he was having a meltdown. It was interesting the way that Annabelle got most of her information and I did like how she'd think through her actions. Oftentimes it was either as she was about to get caught by someone or after the fact, but at least she was considering a course of action. And I do kind of want her to contact Reese. There's definitely potential for something there. At least if certain people don't drive him away...Leatrice was nice, but I really wished she'd just butt out. I mean really, she butts into Annabelle's apartment without notice, invites herself over for food, claims that Annabelle gave her a key (not too sure I fully believe that...based on other things her character did, I wouldn't put it past her to have somehow managed to nab a key from the super) and then wouldn't stop trying to set Annabelle up with Reese. Now, on it's own, that part isn't so bad, Annabelle clearly does need help in that department, but the fact that she glares at anyone else who so much as smiles at Reese just didn't work for me.Kate was a little too much stereotypical hookup girl. Plus, what was with her mangled sayings? I mean, some of them I'll give you. But the way she mangled others felt almost physically impossible for someone with half a brain. And while Kate admittedly appears willing to sleep with anything male, she also seems to have a decent head on her shoulders. Although, she really can't drive, so maybe that's part of it.I also had an issue with some of the editing. There were a few different spelling errors and also at the end Fern suddenly became Fem. Not sure if that was something to do with my NOOK or something that's throughout all the books, but it was a little frustrating.All in all, this was a cute story and interesting way to start the series.

Better Off Wed introduces readers to Annabelle Archer, wedding planner and amateur sleuth (with extra emphasis on the \"amateur\" part). When the overbearing mother of one of her high society brides suspiciously dies at the wedding reception, Annabelle's curiosity is piqued and she immediately starts asking questions. She is accompanied by her assistant, Kate, who has an annoying (and unconvincing) habit of messing up idioms, and Richard, her go-to caterer and best friend. The synopsis on the back of the book states that Richard becomes the prime suspect in the murder investigation, which is what prompts Annabelle to take action, but that is not the case; Richard is barely considered as the murderer, even when a second death occurs. Annabelle just wants to get involved in something that is way out of her depth. And it is; throughout the entire book, Annabelle goes bumbling around, trying to find clues, and generally just causing problems that highlight her own ineptitude. Why the investigating detective, Reese, seemed to like her, I have no idea.The supporting characters were pretty distinct, I will give the author that. However, not many of them were very likable; I mentioned Kate earlier, but Leatrice, Annabelle's elderly neighbor, would have been cute if she didn't butt in literally every time I turned around. She had no concept of minding her own business, and it got annoying very quickly. Detective Reese was okay, but his character kept jumping back and forth between a serious, no-nonsense policeman and a complete flirt, all within the same conversation! I wasn't convinced by him, either.As for the mystery itself, it was interesting enough to hold my attention, but towards the end, it just became obnoxious as Annabelle and co. danced around the same two suspects. By the time the killer was revealed, I was just glad to be done with the constant conversational circling. Also, the way in which Annabelle figured out who did it was a bit of a reach; pulling some obscure fact out of her head after sustaining a concussion, even if it was a mild one, wasn't very realistic. And then, all of a sudden, it was over. The final showdown, the arrest, and the \"resolution\" took place in about four pages, leaving things feeling a bit unsettled after such an abrupt end.

Katie's messing up the favourite sayings didn't annoy me too much but maybe it is kind of stretched out too far even if many times Katie's version fit right into the situation at hand.
