It begins with a family of entertainers walking into a talent agent's office, who asks them to perform their act; the joke's midsection depends on the teller, who then ad-libs the most vile, lewd and disgusting things imaginable: murder, rape, pedophilia, incest and others. The joke ends with the shocked talent agent asking: \"what is this act called?\", to which the family responds with unusual flourish: \"The Aristocrats!\"Decadence and eventual degradation - economical, physical but most importantly moral - of the aristocracy and general upper class is a subject of many novels, among them The Grotesque - in which it is taken to a truly grotesque level. Much like McGrath's second novel, Spider, his debut novel The Grotesque is a work of modern Gothic fiction, with a strong central figure of the main protagonist and narrator.Set in Crook Manon, a Gothic mansion in the English countryside, The Grotesque is narrated by sir Hugo Coal, a self-described paleontologist, scholar and traveler, who is both suspicious of and repulsed by Fledge, his butler, whom he suspects of feeling exactly the same way about him. This would not be anything new or particularly interesting, were it not for the fact that sir Hugo is completely paralyzed - locked in after what he describes as a \"cerebral accident\", which left him \"for all intents and purposes a vegetable\". No one can know if he is conscious - his doctor denies the possibility - but he is biologically alive, and spends what remains of his days in a wheelchair, imprisoned in his own body.Dennis Clegg, the narrator of Spider was a troubled but ultimately likable character; it's easy for the reader to sympathize with him and care for him, as his mental state begins to unravel. In comparison, sir Hugo is thoroughly repulsive - but also infinitely funnier. Dennis's narration is often desperate, a plea for help; sir Hugo calmly recollects what we might perceive as his worst moments, not even troubling to excuse any of them since these are not his worst moments; this is just how he is. A misogynist and a homophobe, sir Hugo proudly recalls how he terrorized everyone around the mansion and lusted after the Butler's wife, while at the same time completely ignoring his own. Fledge, sir Hugo's nemesis, is an ideal Gothic villain - despite witnessing sir Hugo fiddling with his wife he remains calm and collected, which makes sir Hugo despise him even more.The theme of decay runs throughout this book on multiple levels - the physical decay of sir Hugo's paralyzed body and the growing decay of his mental state, the decay of his marriage and aristocratic influence in his own house. No Gothic novel would be complete without a murder, and there is a murder in The Grotesque - and a particularly ghastly one; a young and promising student, engaged to sir Hugo's daughter and aptly named Sidney Giblet will be dispatched from the world in a particularly gruesome way. The question is - who did it? Of course sir Hugo points the finger at the proverbial butler, but did he? Can we know what happened if the person telling us the story is not even able to prove that he is alive, and is a massive prick?The novel is remarkable because of sir Hugo's engaging narration, who is entirely oblivious to the fact at how revolting he is, and is at times almost a pastiche of itself - though always conscious and never venturing into camp territory. The humor in this novel is as funny as it is black: sir Hugo, himself a dinosaur and a relic, has spent 20 years of his life to reconstruct a massive skeleton of a \"phlegmosaurus\" which he keeps in a shed, now abandoned and overgrowing with moss after his accident - much like he himself is slowly growing into his wheelchair; the various names of people and places, such as the Ceck parish in Berkshire, on the river Fling and near Ceck's Bottom; the mentioned unfortunate Giblet, and the Crook estate housing a remarkable Crook as its master.Like Spider, The Grotesque has also been adapted into a film which I have not seen, though this one seems to be a rather obscure adaptation. The novel, though, is certainly worth reading for sir Hugo alone, and his remarkable narration - read the first few pages; if you like them, you're certainly going to enjoy what comes after, a not very scary but truly grotesque story told to you by - who else? - The Aristocrat!"}, {"userName": "Michela De Bartolo", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75871806-michela-de-bartolo", "userReview": "L\u2019origine del termine grottesco risale alle pitture e agli affreschi ritrovati in antiche grotte e in ville romane.

Si tratta sempre della rappresentazione di una situazione ai limiti della realt\u00e0 in cui vengono evidenziati ed esasperati gli aspetti pi\u00f9 comici e paradossali. il romanzo di McGrath offre una piacevole e arguta sintesi di tutti questi aspetti.

Although the Englishman had come out with a volume of shorter pieces earlier that year (\"Blood and Water and Other Tales\"), \"The Grotesque\" was his first foray into the world of the longer form, and was, happily, a stunning success. As of 2013, and having just released his eighth novel, \"Constance,\" McGrath is deemed one of our leading purveyors of what has come to be called \"the new Gothic,\" and a look at his first novel will indicate that his considerable writing ability was already fully formed, right near the beginning. In the book, we meet a cranky, curmudgeonly, highly unlikable British squire--and professional paleontologist--named Sir Hugo Coal. Coal tells us his story several months after having suffered a paralyzing stroke. Now confined to a wheelchair, unable to move or speak, he thinks back on the events of the previous eight months or so at his Berkshire estate, Crook Manor. (The fact that Sir Hugo could not possibly have managed to write or dictate this memoir in his current state may be seen as an inherent flaw in McGrath's novel...or as just one more bit of head-scratching strangeness, in a book filled with so much.) Things had started to fall apart at Crook when his wife, Lady Harriet, had hired a new butler and maid, Mr. and Mrs. Fledge. As Sir Hugo tells us, Fledge had silently mocked his master, seduced his wife, and had even been spotted by Coal himself in the middle of a tryst with Sir Hugo's future son-in-law, Sidney Giblet. When Giblet (the book is replete with outlandish character names) went missing, Coal immediately suspected Fledge of foul play, and when Sidney's buried remains later turned up in the middle of nearby Ceck Marsh, our narrator became even more convinced of his butler's nefarious schemes. But how to prove his suspicions? Readers who thought that the members of TV's Addams family constituted a bizarre household will love reading Sir Hugo's account of his own domestic situation. He himself is a gloomy old coot who spends his days assembling dinosaur bones in the barn; Harriet is a prim and proper biddy who is nevertheless only too willing to give in to her butler's licentious advances; Cleo, the Coals' 18-year-old daughter, is a depressive, suicidal mess, especially after Sidney's remains are found; Mrs. Fledge is a, uh, full-fledged alcoholic; and Fledge himself...well, the man is a cipher of sorts, a blank slate on whom Coal manages to foist all his dark suspicions. As unreliable a narrator as has ever told an untrustworthy story, Sir Hugo himself reveals that his memory is faulty, that his paralyzed isolation has perforce limited his worldview, that he hallucinates frequently, and that he knows that he is telling his story in a faulty order. So ultimately, we don't quite know what to believe, and the solution of Sidney Giblet's murder remains somewhat nebulous. However, as author Peter H. Cannon writes, when discussing why he chose this novel for inclusion in the excellent overview volume \"Horror: Another 100 Best Books,\" the resolution of the book's central crime \"is ultimately of less interest than [McGrath's] memorable portrait of his unreliable narrator as well as of [the book's] minor characters....\" In this book, atmosphere and characterization are paramount to everything except a love of language, and my goodness, what a remarkably great writer Patrick McGrath turns out to be! Offhand, I cannot recall a writer whose use of language has so impressed me since I read Mark Helprin's \"Winter's Tale\" several decades ago. To read this book (and yes, it HAS been my introduction to McGrath's work) is to want to devour many more by this terrific author. It is simply astonishing that \"The Grotesque\" was McGrath's first novel, and makes one wonder what the author had been doing with his life prior to 1989 (working in a north Ontario institution--which doubtlessly gave McGrath a great background for his psychological tales--and as a teacher in the Queen Charlotte Islands off British Columbia, as it turns out). McGrath always seems to know just the right word to use--his vocabulary is immense--and just the right macabre detail to throw in. In short, this is a masterly first novel; a most impressive debut. I was only able to detect one other minor flaw in the entire book: Coal tells us that he had first met his gardener, George Lecky, more than 25 years earlier (the tale takes place in 1949); so that would be 1924 or earlier, right? But a little later, Coal sets the date of their first meeting as 1926. But I am certainly willing to concede that this might be just another bit of unreliable detail on the part of our stroke-addled narrator. \"The Grotesque\" was turned into a film in 1995 and features what I would imagine to be a perfectly well-cast Alan Bates as Sir Hugo and Sting as the mysterious Fledge. Theresa Russell, an actress whom I greatly admire, would seem to be an unlikely choice for Lady Harriet, a plump redhead in McGrath's book, and I am now greatly interested in catching this film, to see if Theresa did indeed manage to pull this characterization off. The film does not enjoy a good reputation (unlike the filmization of McGrath's second novel, 1990's \"Spider,\" as brought to life by David Cronenberg in 2002), and it would be difficult indeed to live up to McGrath's original conception, with its booklength interior monologue and gorgeous use of language...despite the fact that McGrath DID write the screenplay himself. Creepy, spooky, at times hilarious and beautiful, macabre and original, memorable and altogether winning, \"The Grotesque\" novel is certainly a tough act to follow...."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike", "userReview": "This is the second book I\u2019ve read by Patrick McGrath coming fast on the heels of his original collection, \u201cBlood and Water and Other Tales\u201d. \u201cThe Grotesque\u201d echoed some of the darker and stranger stories found in that previous read. As a whole it was very dark, Gothic, and, to me, ponderous. There are a few passages where action occurs quickly, but for most of the book the pace is languid.Perhaps this is to reinforce the somber tone of the story or the state of the first-person narrator. No matter what the reason it makes the book weigh heavily on the reader as they wend through the shaky recollections of Sir Hugo Coal. Plots and motivations float through the head of Sir Hugo as he recounts past events. At times he only gives us a dim view of the past at others we see and hear the action as it happened.The last of a *ahem* dying breed, he is a gentleman naturalist interested in paleontology and, of course, dinosaurs (often considered slow and ponderous). His is the quiet, bucolic life of a country gentleman puttering about with a collection of bones dug up in Africa many years ago. Yep. A quiet man, a nice man, that is to say, when he is not raging in his own hall, accosting and being accosted by the help (two different ones), dealing or avoiding distraught women, attempting to upend the decades-old taxonomy of official scientists, or having a seizure.Purposefully, the story is murky in places. The central crime and some of the lesser mysteries are never solved, despite his constant suspicions. The progression of transgressions and crimes escalates throughout the book. The descriptions of items and people are often ornate and gratuitous. The author gleefully (this is only conjecture on my part) mocks \u201cserious gothic literature\u201d with his plot and characters. But at the same time he captures the air of such stories, reminding me at times of Poe.I have to admit that the death of Sidney and the final revelations of that event amused the heck out of me. So, sue me. I have a black heart, to which I truthfully admit.This book feels like it was written by an outstanding author, but one who perhaps hasn\u2019t turned in his best work or hasn\u2019t yet grown to that \u201cgreatness\u201d that we believe is within him. Like other books that rely heavily on a familiar backdrop (in this case British language and cultural nuances) to which I am not completely privy, I feel like I ought to have enjoyed it more than I did. But even so, I think I would be dissatisfied with the whole. It\u2019s a very solid, very demanding book, but I can only give it \u201c3\u201d to \u201c3.5\u201d stars.

He can't communicate, except through this novel. Aristocratic, entitled, and horribly class-conscious, he oversees his manor, Crook, in England. He likes things just so, and he has no tolerance for those who differ with his opinions. He's a little difficult to like. Even if he's a paleontologist. A new man-servant and his wife are hired. Hugo dislikes them. Distrusts them. He also dislikes his daughter's fianc\u00e9. He ignores his wife, and worries excessively about his academic reputation. He thinks dinosaurs turned into birds and this idea is more important to him than the living people in his life. Then things go wrong. He discovers his daughter's fianc\u00e9 in a gay relationship with the man-servant. Snobbish and intolerant, he has no sympathy for such forbidden love. Then the boy disappears. So much of the novel is inference. After Hugo becomes paralyzed he can't actually investigate and much of the story is his reconstruction of what happened. One gets the sense that his disregard for people has led to his sad situation. His best friend is accused of the murder. The man-servant, he describes in great detail, is sleeping with his wife. And all along the reader doesn't know if any of this is actually happening. Parts of the novel are quite funny, and some actually pretty gothic, but overall there are too many question-marks. Significant events happen and are simply dropped. And when it's over you never really know if any of it was real, beyond the accident that left the narrator paralyzed."}, {"userName": "Luana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4879879-luana", "userReview": "Patrick McGrath, intelligente, ma non si applica.

Sir Hugo is of the Humbert Humbert/Charles Kinbote mold, but for the much of the novel he's in a vegetative state, thinking over how this set of circumstances came to be. It's through his eyes that we see his (perhaps) unfaithful wife, the (perhaps) menacing butler Fledge, the bumbling Sidney, the drunk but tender Doris Fledge, and the melancholy daughter Cleo. It's also through Hugo's eyes that we get the crumbling mansion called Crook, situated at the fringe of an ominous bog in the English countryside, where something terrible has happened. McGrath's language, filtered through Hugo's sharp vocabulary, meanders and second-guesses--the way great unreliable narration should--but it's rarely dull. And if the slim book perhaps could've been a bit shorter and it's last third doesn't match the rest, these are minor complaints. The pleasure of reading \"The Grotesque\" is not finding out how reliable Sir Hugo is or who's the culprit; it's letting Hugo's version of events supplant \"what really happened,\" and for his voice's manipulations and acrobatics to run the show."}, {"userName": "Romy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7376849-romy", "userReview": "A while ago I saw someone make a recommendation request for \"something with a wide cast of eccentric or quirky characters (preferably set in a small town), maybe some dark secrets, preferably with an underlying supernatural events (but not mandatory). I'm not looking for a direct rip-off, but something along the same vain and/or with the same tone (extra points for bizarre events, surreal moments, dark or quirky humor).\"I LOVE Twin Peaks so when someone recommended The Grotesque for this request, I picked it up.Now I'm fully aware that I may have given this book a more favorable review had I not read it with this Twin Peaks frame of mind, but my god, this book was such a disappointment.Firstly, it's British, so it doesn't have that small town America-feel that I was hoping for. Secondly, there are only a handful of characters and none of them are quirky or eccentric. There are some dark secrets but I found myself just not giving a fuck. Right up until the last page I was hoping for a twist that would redeem the book, but it wasn't there.It's a gothic book, but not a particularly good one, and definitely not one that you can compare to Twin Peaks."}, {"userName": "Alessandro Balestra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20967692-alessandro-balestra", "userReview": "Crook \u00e8 una splendida villa cinquecentesca situata nella verde campagna inglese ed \u00e8 qui che vi abita la famiglia Coal.
