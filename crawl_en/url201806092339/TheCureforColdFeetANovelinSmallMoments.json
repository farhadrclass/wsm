This is especially important given that IZZY is targeted more toward the 2nd-4th grade audience while COLD FEET is more for the 4th - 6th grade group. THE CURE FOR COLD FEET is written in verse that perfectly captures the breathless angst and excitement of middle school - as I was reading, I couldn't think of a more appropriate way to convey these emotions. Middle school is messy and unpunctuated and Ain has done an impressive job of using a more-grown-up Izzy to show that. The storyline is poignant, with themes of new friendships and changing old friendships, alongside the story of her parents' new relationships following their divorce. I adore how Ain has included a same-sex relationship for Izzy's mother without that being the focal point of the entire book - as most of us know, parents are important for middle schoolers, but typically THEIR drama doesn't trump that of the middle school crowd. Highly recommended for grades 4-6 and for middle grade library collections."}, {"userName": "Diana Berrent", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17448691-diana-berrent", "userReview": "Izzy is growing up and so are her readers. This book couldn't come at a better time as my daughter is just finishing up her sixth grade year. I can't wait to see her reaction to Beth Ain's painfully realistic description of the trials and tribulations of the start of middle school. This is not the typical suburban divorce YA novel of my youth as the new normal has become more... well... normal. Ain handles complicated issues deftly, crafting Izzy's story in free verse. Don't worry if you missed the first Izzy Klein book (Izzy Klein has Butterflies), you can read this as a standalone, but even better if you followed Izzy through her fourth grade year. Buy this for your fifth grader who will identify with all the nerves of leaving the nurturing halls of elementary school and buy it for your sixth and seventh graders who will identify with the daily struggles of surviving the Lord of the Flies world otherwise known as the Middle School Cafeteria. Izzy, I only wish I had known you when..."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "Like many middle graders, Izzy Kline finds navigating the social groups much more challenging than the classes. Part of the problem is that it seems at least one of her friends is starting to move in a completely different social orbit than Izzy, and another part of the problem is that her social studies teacher insists on the class learning social behavior through dancing, and Izzy's partner is Jackson Allen. Sometimes he seems friendly enough, but at other times, he does stupid, insulting stuff like bringing her dog food in an attempt to ridicule her. As Izzy's mother becomes romantically involved with Jackson's mother, Jackson seeks to blame the woman for breaking up his own parents' marriage, even making derogatory and misguided remarks about her sexuality. Then, too, her older brother James is behaving badly. As her father prepares to marry his second wife, he has second thoughts and almost throws away all that is good in his life. Thank goodness that Izzy has friends, a supportive mother, and a great English teacher who encourages her to write about whatever is on her mind and who nurtures her love for language. Anyone who enjoyed the earlier book in which she was introduced, Izzy Kline Has Butterflies, will enjoy this follow-up novel in verse. Although the author covers some familiar territory about shifting friendships and fitting in here, she also moves readers into some less-familiar areas, doing so with a fresh, authentic voice. She effectively captures the thinking of a unique sixth grader looking for her place in the world. Middle grade readers will enjoy this title and root for everything to work out for Izzy although they know it won't be easy."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18489144-hannah", "userReview": "The Cure for Cold Feet: A Novel in Small Moments by Beth AinThanks to the @kidlitexchange network for the review copy of this book \u2014 all opinions are my own.\u00a0Through clever and honest verses, Beth Ain presents us with, Izzy Kline, the world-class-6th-grade-no-friends-club-founder herself. Izzy is having a rough year. In just a few months, her parents divorced, her father got himself a new girlfriend (cough, cough, I mean, fianc\u00e9), her mom is constantly eating salad and doing yoga with her new best friend (don\u2019t ask), and her older brother. Oh yeah, and she just started middle school too. Not only does it feel like her family is falling apart, but her friends are suddenly completely different people! The kind of weird that used to make Izzy and her friends fun is now \u201ctoo weird,\u201d girls are shiny, boys are sweaty, and everyone is awkward. Yes, Izzy Kline is having a rough year. This novel is a quick, but authentic peek into the chaos of middle school life, commenting on real-world issues most adults assume go unnoticed by middle schoolers (divorce, depression, alcoholism, and the damage smartphones and texting can do to face-to-face relationships).Beth Ain has created a powerful story that gives every bit of credit to the challenges our middle schoolers deal with on a daily basis. This is a must-read for students, teachers, and parents alike!"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8263607-susan", "userReview": "Thank you to @kidlitexchange for sharing the review copy of this book. All opinions are my own.Izzy is in sixth grade. Not only is she navigating middle school, she\u2019s also adjusting to her parents\u2019 divorce, her father\u2019s new fiance, her mother\u2019s new girlfriend (who just happens to be the mother of one of the FOUR ANNOYING BOYS from elementary school) and her adored older brother who has dyed his hair blue and abandoned her for his own friends. Both middle graders and middle school kids will find a lot of themselves in this wonderful novel in verse. They will find much reassurance to learn their struggles with friendship, first crushes and family issues are not unusual, but actually very normal. I especially loved the relationship between Izzy and her mom. It made me think this would be a perfect story to partner read with your daughter. It provides so many opportunities to begin a conversation about the angsts of growing up, as well as to share many laughs. I highly recommend The Cure for Cold Feet. This is a book that needs to be added to both elementary and middle school libraries."}, {"userName": "michelle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73983-michelle", "userReview": "Thanks to the author for providing @kidlitexchange with a review copy of this title - all opinions are my own.I am torn on how I feel about this novel, but I also know that I am not the target audience and it needs to be gauged by how it could help a 4th-6th grader feel. The story was told in verse, which I initially didn't get, but by the end understood how verse was almost like stream of consciousness and allowed Izzy to get out all of her emotions and the confusion that is 6th grade life. The story aptly covers how relationships change as you get older. It focuses on friendships but also a touches a little on family issues and relationships."}, {"userName": "Debbie Armbruster", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19367100-debbie-armbruster", "userReview": "I have been eagerly anticipating this book, ever since reading Beth Ain\u2019s thoughts on its writing. A pleasant story of young adolescence, the transition to middle school, the emotions that come with the divorce of parents, and the turmoil of navigating their new relationships. Personally, I enjoyed reading a novel with Jewish characters that wasn\u2019t centered around the holocaust (something I could have used as a young reader!) I happily anticipate book talking The Cure For Cold Feet to in-coming middle schoolers. Recommended for grades 5-7."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8784116-elizabeth-robinson", "userReview": "The Cure for Cold FeetBy Beth Ain#partner @kidlitexchangeThank you to @kidlitexchange for the review copy of this book.
