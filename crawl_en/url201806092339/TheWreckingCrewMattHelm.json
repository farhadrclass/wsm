He's in Sweden, so we get a fair amount of comparison between the two countries, what he thinks makes sense & what doesn't. More, he is working with another agency who think his job - find & kill the bad guy - makes him a monster. Several darkly ironic situations arise proving the need for men like Helm & why his service exists. They might not like or respect him, but when the bad guys don't play by their rules, they need him - an overriding theme of the series.Hamilton nails traveling across the Swedish landscape & wilderness. I'm currently reading On Guns and Hunting, a collection of his hunting stories. I've read two so far, \"Arctic Hunt\" & \"Hunting the Great Alg\" (or something like that). Both were published in magazines & bits of each appear in this book. In other words, he describes walking across the land so well because he actually did so. Of course, he was hunting birds & moose, but it still...This book is not without it faults, but luckily the most glaring didn't arise until the end. A character has her hands tied behind her & yet stoops to pick a package up off the ground. There's a bit more going on, but I don't want to spoil it. I guess this goof in logic proves that this edition wasn't edited at all. I don't recall noticing this before which is rather strange, but I checked my original paperback, published in 1960, and it is identical in this respect. This is the new edition that just came this week (Feb2013). Anyway, this is one of the few times Hamilton screws up with a logical detail of this sort. It's one of the reasons I like his books so much. He usually gets things like that just right which lends to the realism of the stories. Helm doesn't have a lot of gadgets, mostly makes do with a lot of common sense, logic, & ruthless determination. He's no superman - swears that hitting someone with his fist is pretty useless except for show. He does know some tricky moves, but since his opponent usually does as well, they tend to even out. Overall, it was a great adventure for Helm & sets up the continuing character well. It is one of the few books where his age is specifically mentioned - he's 36 - considered a bit old by many for this game, especially since he hasn't been part of it in 15 years, since WWII.Please help support this wonderful series by buying them. If they do well, we should get to read the final book in the series that Hamilton wrote shortly before he died. The next book is due in August, the fourth in October. Let's hope they stick to the schedule."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "April 2018: This was an emergency read. I listened to the first one Death of a Citizen not long ago & loved it all over again even though I've read it a bunch of times & listened to it just a couple of years ago. I've got a bunch of audio books I'm not sure of, so I dumped all the Matt Helm books on my phone's SD card & plan to keep one ready in the 'started' library just in case I can't take the book I'm listening to while driving. That happened yesterday with a Librivox recording of Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat. The quality is awful, so I switched to this book at a stop light.It was great again. Stephen Rudnicki does a great job narrating. Hamilton took the descriptions of Sweden from personal experience & several of the outdoor scenes are cribbed directly from his nonfiction articles hunting there. Well, Helm was hunting too, just different quarry. As usual, his pragmatic point of view was great.July 2015: The first was so good as an audio book that I couldn't wait to start the second even though I have a couple of other books I want to listen to. This one was fantastic, too. They're even better as audio books, although that's hard to imagine.I've reviewed this book in both its paperback editions & don't have anything to add, although in audio format, I missed his logic goof at the end which I mention in one of the reviews linked below.https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."}, {"userName": "Monnie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie", "userReview": "A while back, I discovered Kindle versions of the 1960s Matt Helm books (there are 27 in all) and decided to work my way through at least a few of them. As I learned from reading the first, Death of a Citizen, they're both well written and very dated - and therein lies the appeal for me, a survivor of teenage years in the 1950s. It's quite a hoot to get the author's take, through the eyes of his government operative Helm; put another way, we've come a long way, baby. Consider this, for instance:Describing a female companion, Helm notes, \"Well, at least she'd had the decency to wear nylons. If there's anything that turns my stomach, it's a grown woman in bobby sox.\"Or this: \"For kicks, you might as well pat Joan of Arc in full armor, as a modern woman in her best girdle.\"Ah yes. As one who remembers trying to wriggle into one of those rubber Playtex girdles (and worse, trying to extricate myself after sweating in what quickly became an up-close-and-personal sauna), that's just plain funny.The story lines are a little dated as well, but only when it comes to more insignificant things like weapons and modes of transportation of choice (Helm is a more-than-decent photographer who uses real film cartridges and typically develops his own pictures, for example). But the action works in any decade, and there's plenty of that to go around. For the record, the books also are on the short side, so a dedicated reader should be able to polish one off in a day. This begins as Helm, whose code name is Eric, has been reactivated into the government organization in which he basically was an assassin after 15 years of living a comfortable life with a wife and family (his wife left him when she discovered what he really did for the government and decided she just couldn't live with a killer even if what he did was for a good cause). Here, Helm is sent to Sweden for the purpose of putting the \"touch\" on a man (or woman) named Caselius, an enemy agent. A man whose writing threatened to \"out\" the agent has been murdered, and his wife, who somehow survived the attack, is trying to carry on her late husband's work. As she collects information, Helm, under the guise of a professional photographer, tags along as she pursues her journalistic efforts. As in most spy stories, though, no one can be trusted - including the widow, Swedish police officers and tough guys who supposedly represent other government agencies. No one knows that better than Helm, and he's keenly aware that he must remain alert to threats from any direction, especially as bodies pile up and he gets closer to his target.Given that many books follow this one, it's no spoiler to say that Helm manages to come through the experience still breathing (something that can't be said about several other characters). All in all, it's another fun book in a series I highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Sidney", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1842024-sidney", "userReview": "Tough, cool and devoid of sentiment, this novel finds super-secret operative Helm on a mission on the heels of Death of a Citizen.

Helm, the hero, is a government assassin sent to kill off a spy who has proven too deadly for the other spies - a typical job for him. He doesn't mow people down in rows like a movie James Bond, but carefully takes out just those he needs to. It's not easy. He's tough & well trained, but so are his opponents. He has to be careful not to offend the local sensibilities too much. It is peacetime & he's a foreign operative in a friendly country with limited latitude. As usual, Matt Helm's tough logic carried him through a dangerous situation, made more so by soft-headed politics. There were several memorable scenes, but one epitomizes Helm's thinking & how at odds it is with the rest of the world. At one point, he must kill a man, a guard for the bad guy. His ally exclaims, \"You shot him in the back!\"Helm agrees. \"He was facing that way.\" No apologies or worries on his part. He needed the man dead & the direction the man was facing wasn't important to him at all. He's extremely pragmatic.One of Hamilton's strengths is his ability to pick out pieces of another country & serve them up in choice bits with his hero in the midst. There wasn't any doubt that he'd visited the country & walked through the areas he described; both the towns & the countryside. (Actually, he was born there.) He gave me a feel for it with a few, well chosen words.See these pages for more of Hamilton's work, about him, & the latest releases.http://www.matthelmbooks.com/intro.htmlhttp://www.benish-industries.com/hami...http://goodreadergonebad.net/donaldha..."}, {"userName": "Skip Maloney", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2168637-skip-maloney", "userReview": "On a whim, I opted to record a TCM showing of the 1968 film, \"The Wrecking Crew,\" starring Dean Martin as secret agent Matt Helm. I knew from experience that this wasn't likely to be a story-telling gem of any kind, having seen the other three that had been made. But not remembering \"The Wrecking Crew\" specifically, I half-wondered whether as the last one made, it might have been akin to some sort of crowning achievement.Fat chance.Same un-talented actor, mugging for the cameras, pretending to be irresistible to women, all in service to a terrible script that bore no resemblance to Donald Hamilton's 1960 novel of the same name. I assumed the 'no comparison' thing at first, because it had actually been a long time since I'd read it. I shut the movie off, less than half way through it, went to my bookshelf and took down my copy of \"The Wrecking Crew.\"\"I awoke early, shaved, dressed, draped myself with cameras and equipment, and went on deck to record our entry into the port of Gothenburg. I couldn't think of a likely market for the shots, but I was supposed to be an eager and ambitious free-lance photographer, and I'd be expected to be alert to the chance that somebody would fall overboard or the ship would hit something.\"I didn't analyze this when I read it. All I did was keep reading. And reading, and reading, and before I knew it, I had finished this second installment of this 27-chapter series of novels by Donald Hamilton, about and narrated by the protagonist, Matt Helm. Only after the fact, did my curiosity take me back to the opening paragraph, where I discovered some essential story-telling concepts. Although personally, I go out of my way to avoid a first-person narration tale that begins with the \"I\" pronoun, Hamilton does this blatantly, and then constructs a terrific sentence that identifies the location of our hero, Matt Helm, and tells us what he's carrying. Then he rather slyly lets us know that he's only \"supposed to be\" a photographer, and that his trip to the ship's deck to take photos is phony. Ending with a joke about somebody falling overboard or the ship hitting something. It's not so much that it's brilliant writing (although I think it is), it's just that, for me, as breezy as it sounds, that opening paragraph, from its five-activity opening sentence, to the joke that completes it, shows signs of being crafted. Maybe it came out of Hamilton effortlessly, in which case, hats off, or maybe he worked at it for a little while, deciding that instead of four activities in that opening sentence, he'd go for five. There are alternatives to delivering the information in this opening. He chose the ones he did, wisely, because sure enough, I moved on to paragraph two and beyond.A little late, here, but don't get me started on this whole series. I have read them all, and now that I just finished #2 again, I might well go on to #3 and beyond. I will also, for sure, track down #28, a novel called \"The War Years,\" written by Keith Wease, which offers a prequel (WWII) back story to the whole Matt Helm tale, which I have only just become aware of.It's a terrific series (and you really should start with \"Death of A Citizen\" - #1), and as a spy, Helm is the best. Better than Bond, better than Bourne (even in the Ludlum, pre-movie days) better than any number of espionage heroes that have come down to us through the ages. He's just a good guy to spend some time with, and you'll learn as much, if not all you need to know, about the nature of spying, and the nature of humans. . ."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "Have you ever heard of Matt Helm? If so, was it from the old movies? the old TV series? (Frankly I'd forgotten there even was a TV series). Hf you know Helm from there, well you still don't know Matt Helm.I started with a few strikes against me as well. I was a fan of what is generally called \"spy-fi\" back in the '60s. Most are familiar with James Bond (007) written by Ian Fleming. There were also other books and movies that leaned heavily on action and sometimes on \"gadgets\". I liked The Man From U.N.C.L.E., I Spy, Secret Agent (called Danger Man in the UK). I had my walls lined with shelves of paperback books.But after seeing the movies (at the drive-in with my girl [so I can't guarantee I actually caught the movies every time) I decided that I wasn't interested in Helm.See in the late '60s and '70s along with a rampant swing left movies and TV series also began to parody anything that might picture the US or Western intelligence community in a positive light. We got Our man Flint and The President's Annalist. Along with these Dean Martin played a campy Matt Helm surrounded by skimpily clad \"girls\".Okay so what is Matt Helm (the original or \"real\" Helm in the books) like. Well many have described him as a more realistic James Bond. Far from being \"campy\" and humorous Helm is a deadly serious agent. While you have to do a little suspension of disbelief on the time line (he would get a bit too old to perform if he stayed in action as long as the books actually go) the man is a good character. Coming out of WWII he is called back at \"times of need\" because he's good at what he does.The Matt Helms books are a bit darker, grittier and in some ways more violent. Helm gets dirty and does his job, even when it's unpleasant.In the movie Wrecking Crew it's a group of \"girls\" who are the \"Wrecking Crew\". Again, forget that. We get some insight into \"who\" the \"Wrecking Crew\" are here and where the term comes from. We get to see how people can be manipulated by those who are willing to use them. Personally I think we get a chance to look at our own attitudes.Up front, Helm is an assassin at least at times. He asks a question in the book that I think needs to be asked. When a woman tells him she \"just can't get past what he does\" he questions. The pilot who dropped the atomic bomb is a hero but because he directs a single bullet to a single chosen target he's condemned and looked down on. How's that work? I've thought of that for years. War can be necessary and I respect our fighting people. That said sometimes you need a scalpel not a sledge hammer. Why do people feel okay about being judgmental toward people who fight one on one on the shadows?Oh well. Good books, recommended.

MacDonald started his Travis McGee series, Donald Hamilton started his Matt Helm series. THE WRECKING CREW is really the first proper Matt Helm book. The earlier one, DEATH OF A CITIZEN, isn't worth bothering with, IMHO. [John D.'s McGee novels are notable for tangents where McGee will make acidic observations on society--a good argument can be made that John D. stole this riff from Hamilton's earlier Matt Helm novels and expanded on it.]Matt Helm novels require a bit more suspension of disbelief than the average pulp novel, but they are a superior ride. The Matt Helm Signature Move, throughout the series, is allowing himself to be captured and/or tied up by the Bad Guys in order to somehow advance the objectives of his mission. This Signature Move is first introduced (sort of) in THE WRECKING CREW for a legitimate plot reason: Matt has to remain true to his \"cover\" by demonstrating how incompetent and harmless he is. I remember one time my Dad gave me a new Matt Helm that he had read, but I hadn't. I said something like, \"Don't tell me. Matt gets tied up before page fifty.\" I don't remember what he said back to me, but his answer could have in no way been a \"spoiler\" because we both knew that it wouldn't really be a Matt Helm novel unless he got tied up at some point or other.@hg47"}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42426054-ellen", "userReview": "A book from 1960, but it still feels quite fresh. Matt Helm, our killer/spy hero, is a sexist bastard, who dismisses women after a glance if they for example wear pants, since that \"does nothing\" for him. But that feels OK, the era these books were written in was nothing like my life in Scandinavia today, and of course there are huge differences. Helm is a James Bond kind of guy, just bloodier and less \"fun\". In this book he travels to my part of the world, and it is interesting how he points out prejudice from both Scandinavians and Americans - like that Americans believe Scandinavians are more primitive and runs in the mountains all the time, and that Scandianavians believe Americans to be soft and even unable to drive without automatic gears.

That is a much better book however than the one being reviewed: THE WRECKING CREW. WRECKING CREW isn't a bad story, it contains the requisite action, femme fatale and Mac (my favorite character in spy fiction), the necessary base ingredients for any Helm outing. I've read every novel in the series at least twice except for final ones numbered 19 through 27 (once was enough), but in THE WRECKING CREW Eric's voice just doesn't sound right to me. It's off the way Robert B. Parker's is off when doing a Marlowe pastiche (which is not to say Parker didn't do a good Chandler impersonation, he did!).THE REMOVERS, the third in the series, reads more like the sequel to DEATH OF A CITIZEN than this second entry. My theory is DEATH OF A CITIZEN started life as a standalone book and Fawcett told Hamilton they wanted a series about Helm's shadow world. I can just imagine them ordering him to fire up the production line and crank 'em out. I believe THE WRECKING CREW was either the current book Hamilton was writing or a reject from the past. He'd never written a series character before and just changed some names and called THE WRECKING CREW the second Helm volume before getting to work on THE REMOVERS.I give THE WRECKING CREW three stars, but measured only against the spectrum of the first 18 Helms, after THE TERRORIZERS #18 the series died despite nine more published works. Helm's suspenseful adventures thrived in a 140 to 190 page format. In the latter volumes Hamilton had to add 100 or 150 more pages to make a Helm book hefty enough for its $2.95 price tag. The longer stories became lugubrious with superfluous incident and detail that bowdlerized Hamilton's short-form suspense formula. A pity of Hamletic proportion.The only other discordant note than THE WRECKING CREW in the first 18 exploits of Matt Helm is THE SHADOWERS, a book that starts out great but stumbles to its knees and whimpers to an end. There are two other misfires in those initial 18 editions: THE RAVAGERS #8 had the usual Hamilton verve but lacked his usual punch despite a clever twist in Act III; THE RETALIATORS #17 is a fourth weak point, but only because Helm should have shot the maddening female lead in that one as fast as he could draw that five-chambered .38 S&W snubnose he dislikes so much. These four books don't approach the zenith of the series: Citizen, Removers, Murderers' Row, Ambushers, Devastators, Betrayers, Menacers, Interlopers, Terminators or Terrorizers. Those ten books are the pillars of strength shoring up the Helm legend. The remaining four, Silencers, Poisoners, Intriguers and Intimidators, are excellent reads but not great like the aforementioned ten. They're two different words in my vocabulary. There's a lot of excellence in this world, but so very little greatness."}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5900387-paula", "userReview": "I enjoyed The Wrecking Crew even more than the first one, Death of a Citizen.

Through the first pages/chapters, Helm is relatively unaffected (yeah, normal for the genre) over his wife's choice to divorce him. This is filled in towards the end, but Matt resists introspection (bad for a spy's health). He has much to ponder as partners and acquaintances die like flies along the way, but he reminds himself it serves no purpose at the end of the day.However, Hamilton has taken a big step away from a lot of baggage in his writing. What remains is still good pulp. What is interesting is the step away from urbanized mystery(The Pink Panther has overtaken that property) and out into the tundra north of the Arctic Circle. The Wrecking Crew also sustains a consistency that has spanned Hamilton's previous spy novels. First: naive young women never survive, and seldom do world-worn ones. Second: their death is tied to the wilderness even if it has to be a park in Stockholm, a flea-bag motel in the desert, or the distant, wooded Chesapeake properties around Washington D.C..In Death of a Citizen, Hamilton describes Matt Helm as a writer of Westerns. This is reflective of his own authorship in that genre, and an amusing tag put on Helm. Matt, the Western story writer, reflects how simple it is to use Comanches as the universal villain. Hamilton doubles down at Matt's expense in The Wrecking Crew to put Matt into a Stetson and cowboy boots clambering off the train in Stockholm--amusing.These touches combine here in the grand finale which is staged like an indian attack on the isolated settler's home.This is not to diminish Hamilton's work. Geoffrey Household did it in Rogue Male back in 1939. I would suggest readers of the Matt Helm series to look into this title. Another author who similarly went into nature to find the dark was John Buchan (Governor General of Canada) with his Richard Hannay series: The 39 Steps."}, {"userName": "Ardee-El", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51792960-ardee-el", "userReview": "I think this is an improvement over the first Matt Helm novel (Death of a Citizen): We__re already somewhat familiar with Helm__s world, he__s jettisoned his wife and family, he__s back at his cold-blooded work__he is a government-sanctioned assassin, after all__and he__s out of his accustomed southwestern element. What hasn__t changed is that no one__s agenda is quite what it seems to be, and nearly everyone he meets is lethal, one way or the other. Helm is, above all else, a practical man: He spends no time grieving, will shoot members of the opposition in the back, and feels no sympathy for an annoying ostensibly friendly-side agent who is stupid enough to stand in a lighted window, thereby drawing a gunman__s bullet. The book is also an interesting time capsule: The sixties won__t be the Sixties for a few more years, so most of the attitudes are 1950s holdovers. Much ink is also used musing over attitudes Helm finds hypocritical, that people (such as his ex-wife) can look down on his kind of surgical assassination while lauding, say, a bomber pilot, simply because the kind of death a pilot doles out is impersonal and done during wartime. In that regard, Helm is simply ahead of the curve."}, {"userName": "George K.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4675995-george-k", "userReview":
