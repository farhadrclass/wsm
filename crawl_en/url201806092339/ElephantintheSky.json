Childhood mental illness is not a common subject, and I was eager to learn how a family navigated the journey. However, I felt the book was simplistic, the boy was very childish for a 9 year old (super-heroes at age 9? I think not) and the mom was ridiculous. She ignored the daughter, doted on the son, was always so perfect in her job & consideration/interactions with her husband. Completely not realistic. And the moment she says no to her boss he backs down & says they need her & they'll take her whenever she's available? Please. Also, it seemed to me that Nate was showing signs of schizophrenia, not bipolar disorder (but I am not a doctor). I'm giving this a 3 instead of a 2 because childhood mental illness is important and anything that gets people educated is a start."}, {"userName": "Nina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11215896-nina", "userReview": "What an amazing book.

Widely acclaimed for her ability to tell emotionally powerful stories that capture the real lives of women, bestselling author Heather A. Clark tackles the subject of childhood mental disorders. ELEPHANT IN THE SKY is told from both nine-year-old Nate's point of view and that of his mother, Ashely, an overworkd ad executive who struggles with a demanding workload and the worry that she's not spending enough time with her family - especially as her son's battle with mental unbalance and paranoid delusions escalates. The two narratives converge in a deeply moving tale of a family dealing with mental illness. ELEPHANT IN THE SKY is a story about unconditional love, and it articulates a complicated, real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity. It looks at what it means to be different in our society and beautifully explores the distance a mother will go to protect her child. My Review:ELEPHANT IN THE SKY was a riveting read. The characters were well fleshed out and the situation of dealing with mental illness was real, it was like reading a true story. I felt that Ashely and her husband were a bit slow on the uptake in picking up the fact that their nine-year-old son was exhibiting behaviours that were very inappropriate for his age and felt they should have sought help for him much sooner than when they did. However, they finally did become involved with the right people and the story moved at a steady pace holding my attention page after page after page.This was one book I really enjoyed! Heather's first book was titled: Chai Tea Sunday and was also an excellent read."}, {"userName": "Emily Burns", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22142900-emily-burns", "userReview": "Throughout my time reading Elephant in the Sky, I felt so very torn. At once, I felt both engrossed, so invested in the story of Nate's diagnosis and recovery, and simultaneously annoyed and furious with the personality and inner dialogue of his mother Ashley. The constant repetition at times of the offensive phrase 'crazy people' and the should-have-been-edited-because-it-was-included-far-too-often 'our son' - even though Ashley often claimed ownership over Nate and made important decisions without discussing them with her husband - were frustrating. Her own painfully uninvestigated biases and stigma about mental illness, her simpering and one-dimensional desire to protect her twelve-year-old, her naive realization that she had never had to not be 'normal' in society because she is a white straight able-bodied woman and how upset she was that this privilege would be revoked once people found out about Nate's condition... Were she real, I would not want this woman in my life. She was not likeable.Secondly, as a Torontonian, this story did not ever, once, truly feel like it was taking place in Toronto. Mentioning Bloor and Sassafraz does not a Toronto story make. The brief mention of Oakville, when her neighbour says they are moving there so they have a parking space for their car, fell flat and did not contribute to anything else in the story (except to serve as a shout-out to the author's hometown).All of this said, I found Nate's voice truthful and convincing, and I think that telling stories about mental illness in children and in families is important. The dimension of the novel that focuses on Ashley's father is strong. I don't usually write Goodreads reviews, but I had such a conflicting experience reading this novel that I just had to distill those thoughts."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13060256-elaine", "userReview": "This is a good read which really grabbed me. It is the story of Ashley and her nine year old son Nate and is told alternatively from each perspective. Ashley is a hard working career woman whose husband Pete stays at home every day to look after their two children. Ashley is convinced that something is not right with Nate, but Pete will not take her fears seriously, claiming Nate is just a normal kid, who gets moody, naughty and acts hyper now and again. As the story progresses into the tale of mental illness in the young, it becomes absolutely gripping. It covers the suspicions, the diagnosis and early attempts at medication and as it is told from both viewpoints you really get an idea of what it is like for both of them. I really felt for Nate as he suffered and the parts of the book in his voice could be quite moving. I equally empathised with Ashley and how she was torn between wanting to be with her son 24 hours a day and her career, which at the end of the day she needed in order to pay medical bills if nothing else. It is a very difficult subject to tackle, but I felt it was handled sensitively and realistically. I could feel the strain it was putting the whole family under, not to mention the relationship between Pete and Ashley. It is not always the easiest story to read, because of its content, but one that is well worth reading.

Childhood mental illness has touched several families close to me lately. I was looking forward to learning about the diagnosis process and the disease and impact on the family. Unfortunately, the terrible writing and lack of editing completely got in the way of any actually learning or reading pleasure. I found Ashley, the mother, completely selfish and unbelievable. Her self-absorbed way of processing everything was flat and lacked realism. This would have benefitted from reality checking with actual working parents. Nate, though ill, was not delayed. The dialogue for Nate sounded so much more like that of a much younger child that I found it distracting. It takes years for a family to come together and realign after a diagnosis of mental illness. This dysfunctional family (on arguably at least three dimensions) healed completely within four months. This implausible feat would have been fantastic to learn about as an accomplishment- but since it is so implausible that even the author likely didn't believe it - it was added as the last chapter .... A kind of look how well we are doing now.

Although the over-arching message of the book was a good one and I think there need to be more books concerning mental health issues, I found the story to be overly simplistic and the writing to be rather juvenile.

I really liked the premise of the book itself as it is so rarely talked about in books. I really felt for Nate, especially when it came to the kids bullying him in class; it was unfair and harsh. Ashley was definitely stuck in a hard place as she had to deal with her career and Nate's failing health. I felt that the author portrayed each of the characters well by outlining their ups and downs as they dealt with Nate's illness. I also liked how the book was told by both Nate and Ashley's perspectives, although I would have loved to read of Pete's perspective being that he was the main caregiver of the children while Ashley was at work.

His disappearances and medical treatment paints an image that is believable and heart-breaking. The storyline of this book and subject matter was good and interesting.

I had an imaginary friend when I was about five and I think a lot of children do but the extremes that Nate demonstrated clearly indicated his illness and the line between imagination and illness. Parents can rationalize extreme behaviour as normal boy behaviour when they don't share their concerns with anyone. It's like admitting you are a bad parent that can't control your child.

The style that Clark was using to write seemed easy to follow, and seemed to read smoothly. Unfortunately, it didn't take long before I grew bored and uninterested in the story because the style seemed to become juvenile.The subject of mental illness is a difficult one to take on, especially where the point of view of a child is concerned. I have yet to find another book that has attempted to portray what this might be like for a child, and as such I feel like Clark bit off more than she could chew. Her portrayal of Nate was very skewed and unbelievable (she writes that he is of the age of 9, but his dialogue and love for superheros depicts his maturity level of someone of a much younger age). His bipolar tendencies are described as horrific hallucinations, which does not seem to mirror the appropriate symptoms of bipolar disorder.Nate's mother Ashley also comes across as a very selfish individual, and everything about her seemed very delusional. She is described as this very important career woman, but her skill set and position itself are very poorly developed. I felt like Clark was trying to depict her as a magazine big-wig from New York in a high rise office building, being pulled from one meeting to the other in an attempt to keep all her clients happy. Yet, when she is finally faced with making a choice between her work and her home life...she has a heart to heart with her boss and all is right in the world of advertising!When the big \"plot twist\" is revealed, I wanted to stop reading. I actually rolled my eyes and thought - \"that's the best you could come up with?\"Maybe I am still coming down off of the high of Shutter Island (a VERY well written suspense surrounding mental illness)... but this book just wasn't it for me."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2378632-kate", "userReview": "There are aspects of this book that I really liked - notably Nate's point of view - and others that I didn't.The story overall is an important one. The more stories out there like this the better but that doesn't make this one perfect. The story seemed almost a parable. I found the parents to have had their roles and reactions assigned to them rather than being actual, holistic, parts of their character. There's also an almost infuriating emphasis on the maternal instinct - mother Ashley knows right away something is wrong while her stay at home husband Pete is in denial (denial brought on while trying to convince Ashley that there's nothing wrong which I just find suspect considering what plot points are revealed later. I sympathize with any parent having to tackle mental illness with a child so young but, as I said, I just couldn't connect with the parents - mostly the mother, the father didn't have much of a presence aside from Nate and Ashley's impressions of him. It would have been interesting to have his perspective as well; especially considering that his relationship with Nate I think was sacrificed for the narrative of a mother knowing best.I did like Nate's chapters a lot, both the brevity and the content, and I found that quite realistic. I also enjoyed the parts in the hospital and after as they struggle to find a treatment that works for Nate. Despite my criticisms I do believe that we need more of these stories and I'm glad that this books exists if only for that.

I could not put this book down. As a teacher, I have seen the struggles some families face when mental illness begins to emerge. The novel, based on a true story, did show the gold standard in treatment of children's mental illnesses, which I only wish was a reality for children suffering. Too often, we see the more negative results of misdiagnosis and misunderstanding. I liked how the author showed the struggles between parents/partners due to the stress it puts on everyone involved. I loved the perspective from the 9 year-old boy, and could truly feel his frenzied state juxtaposed with his depression. I could also relate to his teacher's desire to help, yet not knowing how to best approach him or how to deal with the other students in the class with their bullying. Schools really don't have the resources to appropriately handle complex mental health issues, unfortunately. I did find parts of his sister's character a bit out of sync with the rest of the novel, but not to the point that it impacted the story. The struggle of a parent trying to balance work-home life was well done & I was glad to see a stay-at-home dad instead of the more stereotypical stay-at-home mom. I also enjoyed the ending & how she left us with everything so wrapped up with a pretty bow on top.

Without spoiling this magnificent read, things start imploding and the family must figure out how to live the new normal.First, as a working woman I LOVED the portrayal of the working mom. The honesty to show that it is hard for the parent that is at work to be completely in the know at home also was great. I loved the arc of this mom as she made more of an effort to work on the home/work balance and how that is a struggle to be fully present in both places.

So far so interesting, but Ashley herself is a deeply unlikeable and self-centred character, and the chapters in which we see the world from Nate\u2019s point of view seem far too articulate for a child. There are some good points to this otherwise flawed novel \u2013 the constant pull between home and work is sympathetically portrayed, as is the denial that anything can be really wrong with a much-loved child plus the pressures of family life in general \u2013 but the ending is far too pat, and the true heartbreak of such situations never really acknowledged.

But reading this book wasn't really easy for me. Yes, I had encountered numerous novels about teenagers and adults dealing with mental disorder but never of a nine year old boy with a bipolar disorder. It was different and must be hard on Nate's part. It teared me up when I was reading about his agony. On the other note, his mother Ashley who's a busy career woman working as a creative director in an advertising company struggles to balance her work life and her family. As a result, when Nate began to show early symptoms of his illness, she instantly knew something was wrong. It was a heartwarming novel that moved me.

I also found it ended quite abruptly and was a bit too happily-ever-after. (The abruptness is partly because I read it on my phone so didn't have a sense of how much of the book was remaining, but it still seemed fast.) It made sense why it ended so quickly, and maybe I wasn't quite ready for it to end, or to end so neatly. The majority of the book was quite suspenseful but it kind of lost its steam in the last part of the book, for good reason but it was quite a change of pace.
