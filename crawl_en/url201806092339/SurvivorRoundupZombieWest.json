I haven't read book one of this series and I think I wish I had first, just because I enjoyed the characters so much that I wanted a bit more of a back story for them. Although, I didn't read book one, I wasn't so left out of details that I couldn't really get into a good story. I still plan on reading book one to fill in some of the spaces. SURVIVOR ROUNDUP is a unique twist on the zombie genre. I love that the author mixed cowboys and zombies. I was also intrigued with the premise and just after reading a couple of pages, I was hooked. It's such an original, fast paced read that will have you feeling a string of emotions.The characters were nicely written and expressed well. I loved Red(Elizabeth). I couldn't imagine going through what she has in such a short amount of time. It was tragic. I also enjoyed Trance. He's a great character who's loyal, loving and determined. I felt pain at the loss of a certain character, but I guess there's always loss in a zombie apocalypse. One thing I have to say is because I didn't get the full introduction, since I missed book one, I didn't really see it as a YA novel. Not much indicated it as such. I may have missed the part where she told her age, but I couldn't seem to find it mentioned said in the novel. Either way, YA or adult, this novel rocked! It has The Walking Dead touch, where you have a variety of characters you're routing for and seeing them survive is one hell of a ride! I can't wait to read Dead Plains, which will be released in the Summer of 2013. Come onnn Summer!"}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10627459-tammy", "userReview": "Imagine it! Zombies in the wild west! What an exciting mixture of zombies and cowboys! That is the only world that Red has ever known. Red and her new family have found shelter in an old fort. Surrounded by thick walls they don't have to worry about the walking dead outside. New beginnings and a food shortage force Red and Trace to go salvage for supplies. With Red's special \"ability\" they can get closer to the zombies than most people.Red and Trace soon run into trouble. Someone from Red's past has not forgotten about her and would do anything to have her back. They have some tough choices to make, not to mention there are a lot of people counting on them back home. Will they make it back in time?When I first started reading this book, I was unaware it was the second book in a series. It was not until I was half way through that I realized it. There is enough back story that the book can be read by itself, though I really want to read the first to get caught up on all the action. The characters are wonderfully written and well liked. Red and Trace have to go through so much and still prevail. I also enjoyed the Native American characters we are introduced to. Aponi, a great healer and her little brother Kitchi, who is destined to be a great warrior. I am a true zombie lover, I have read all types of zombie genre. Some great and some not so. This is one of the great ones. You can't go wrong reading Angela Scott's Zombie series."}, {"userName": "Misty Baker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4056115-misty-baker", "userReview": "You know that saying \u201cI don\u2019t have to be faster than everyone, I just have to be faster than you?\u201dI call bullshit.See, I am not a runner. As a matter of fact, \u201crunning\u201d is a four letter word in my house (strictly forbidden upon pain of spork in eye.) Knowing this (the running part, not the \u201cI\u2019m one step away from a loony-bin spork threats\u201d part) I\u2019ve had to devise my own zombie Apocalypse plan.1. Running is for suckers (or really skinny chicks names Kelley <\u2013with an e.) Avoid it at all cost because one block in your ass is going to be on the ground puffing like a hypertensive blow-fish.)2. Guns blow. They are loud and unless you took a \u201cbullet making\u201d course at your local community college, chances are you are going to run out of bullets before your town runs out of brain deprived mommy munchers.And 3. Swords worked for King Arthur they are good enough for me.So feel free\u2026run. When you get tired (and inevitably die a horrible death that is bound to involve missing limbs of some sort) I\u2019ll be sure to collect you scattered parts and use them as kindling.Why does this matter? It doesn\u2019t\u2026 I just wanted to talk about my awesome plan. Oh\u2026and this book about zombies and a girl who uses a sword. Take that naysayers!!!\u201cRed always knew she would have to face the man who nearly destroyed her. She just didn\u2019t figure it would happen so soon\u2026With the plague sweeping across the nation, destroying many and turning others into walking corpses, survivors head West in search of a chosen land, a place designed to keep the infected out, while sealing survivors inside. In theory, the idea seems the only way to keep humanity alive. In practice, it doesn\u2019t matter whether a person is on the inside or the out\u2014there is no humanity.\u2026And even though John Gatherum hunted her down and instigated their reunion, Red\u2019s no longer the passive girl he once manipulated. This time, she has a hidden agenda of her own.Kill him. Save her family. Save herself.\u201dOk, so now that you\u2019ve confirmed that I may in fact be a lunatic, how about we talk about Survivor Roundup (book #2 in the Zombie West Series)Keeping with the tradition of me being a total hardass, I\u2019ll start off by saying SR was not as good as it\u2019s predecessor. Good but not AS good.Why?Because I didn\u2019t like the Indians. (Hmm\u2026maybe I should have worded that differently. You know, where I don\u2019t sound racist.)Anyways, in the beginning of SR we are reintroduced to Red and Trace. The super/awesome/we-can-survive-the-end-of-humanity-as-we-know-it power couple. Things are great (minus the almost starving part) and the zombies are out of arms reach. (Cha-ching.)But, this is a story about zombies and Red the \u201calmost zombie\u201d (<\u2013yes, that is a technical term. *cough*) so things can\u2019t stay happy right? Right! So Red and Trace set off on an epic journey to find food. (Duh\u2026 I did say that almost starved, remember.) And after one day (I think) tragedy befalls them. They are separated and this is where the story really starts to take shape. (Ahem\u2026Indians.)So what was my problem with the Indians?Nothing really\u2026the actual Indians were great. I loved their individual personalities and they served a purpose. The problem I had was that I was bored. For some reasons these particular chapters (which happened to be from Trace\u2019s POV) seemed to drag. Maybe it was the repetition of \u201cyou are weak\u201d \u201cyou are lazy\u201d that had me yawning and clamoring for Red\u2019s chapters. (We get it!!! He got his ass handed to him.) Maybe I just have a raging girl crush on Red. (Come here honey\u2026give mama a hug) Regardless, I found myself sighing (on more than one occasion) when I flipped the page to find I was no longer with the red-headed hotshot, but her long-lost beau instead. (Boo!)Indians and perpetual boredom aside\u2026Ms. Scott had absolutely zero problem delivering in the ick department. Need proof? Ok! The passage below illustrates just how proficient she is at building a scene. A nauseating/completely rad scene.\u201cThe thick smell of blood and rotting fish hit him hard, but that wasn\u2019t what threatened to turn his stomach. Metal pans, scalpels, saws, butcher knives, ice-pics, and unidentifiable tools of equal destruction reflected the dim light. Bottles filled with god-knows-what sat on shelves. Hooks hung from the edges of a large, wooden table that appeared stained with\u2026Oh jeez.\u201d Still not convinced? Try this on for size:\u201cFoamy saliva leaked through the cracks of her mask as she snapped and growled, and the table shook when she banged the back of her head against it over and over again. One end of the rubber tubing plunged straight into the top of the girl\u2019s skull, the other stuck straight out of her open chest, revealed her blackened, un-beating heart.\u201dMakes you hungry doesn\u2019t it? (lol)All kidding aside, though not as good as her debut\u2026it was still one heck of a kick-tush zombie romp. One that genuine zombie fans are sure to enjoy.Drama + Zombies + Evil Dr. Frankenstein-ish type wacko =awesome, bang-up, capital, champion, excellent, fine, first-rate, fly, top, whiz-bang, wonderful.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: Swords only need to be sharpened!!!!"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745176-maria", "userReview": "I received a complimentary copy of this book as a part of a book tour in exchange for a fair and honest review. I rated it 4.5 Stars. In an alternate old West roamed by zombies and survivors, Angela Scott's Survivor Roundup, the story of Elisabeth, aka \"Red\", a woman stuck between both worlds, and Trace aka \"Cowboy\", the man in love with her, begins where Wanted: Dead or Undead left off. Introducing a handful of new secondary characters, new adventures and a climactic faceoff with Red's nemesis, John Gatherum, this rousing addition to The Zombie West series is sure to please any paranormal or western romance lover. It kept me turning the pages late into the night.Beginning where we last left the resilient group of zombie fighters; Red and Trace little family gets a new addition when Wen and Carolyn have a baby. Realizing the fort where they've been living is getting low on supplies, Red and Trace know things will have to change in order for all of them to survive. Leaving Wen, Carolyn, and the children behind, Red and Trace decide to leave the fort and forage for supplies agreeing to come back within a month with whatever they've been able to scavenge. As Red and Trace travel in search of food, it becomes obvious Red's body has truly changed as a result of her continued exposure to zombie bites. While still human, Red is now able to walk among zombies without them even picking up her scent - she appears invisible to them. While Trace considers this a miracle - it makes Red uncomfortable. She's worried about the state of her humanity. When Red and Trace are split up by a group of roaming cowboys - it'll take more than all of the skills each has acquired to survive. They'll end up having to rely on the help of acquaintances they make along the way. I really enjoyed how Ms. Scott continued to develop Red and Trace's relationship as both a couple and as individual adults; we get to see them at both their best and at their worst. We also get to meet some really interesting and incredible secondary characters in this installment, from Kitchi and Aponi, two native American Indians, who help Trace survive his experiences to Nash, Red's temporary kidnapper and Davis Story, her older brother, two men who are instrumental in helping Red face off against her enemy, John Gatherum. Ms. Scott did a good job developing and exposing us to John and the evil he has become - he was the perfect villain and it was easy to root for Red and her group to win.Will Red and Trace be able to make it back home together in time to save their friends? And what new secret will Red have to share with Trace? You'll have to read Survivor Roundup to find out. I enjoyed it and can't wait to read the next installment in this series, Dead Plains, set to release in 2013."}, {"userName": "Nancy (The Avid Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7149266-nancy-the-avid-reader", "userReview": "The following review is my opinion and not a paid review. I received a free copy of the book from the author for an honest review.Red, Trace, Wen, Caroline, their new baby girl, Rivers, Fisher and Ira are all still living in the military fort. What few supplies that they have are dwindling away. If they are going to survive someone has to risk going outside the walls of the fort to face the zombies and bring back more. So Red and Trace volunteer to be the ones to go find more food for everyone.They run into a whole world of trouble outside the walls. The zombies are not the only thing they have to worry about on the outside. Humans are their biggest problems. Red and Trace is kidnapped by some evil and cruel brothers. They end up separated from each other and Red thinks that Trace is dead.In Survivor Roundup we have some new characters join us Aponi and her little brother Kitchi along with Nash one of her kidnappers. Red's brother Davis also joins them after he figures out what kind of person John Gatherum really is. John has been using Davis to lure Red into his lair only Davis did not know this. John will do anything he has to in order to get his hands on Red no matter who it may hurt or how many lies he has to tell.Red has a plan she is tired of running and hiding from John so she is going to find him and kill him. Then she can go back to her \"family\" and not have to hide any more. She has to be quick about it or her \"family\" will not survive without her. Her \"family\" is waiting and depending on her to bring food back to them.I love reading books or watching movies with zombies in them. I have been known to watch a few westerns like Lonesome Dove in my time too. But to have zombies and cowboys together in the same story is one extremely brilliant idea. I love it! Wouldn't you just love to see Trace on the big screen? I loved reading the first book WANTED: Dead or Undead in the Zombie West Series. I also love Survivor Roundup. And now I can't decide which one I liked the best. They were both so awesome.I can't wait to find out more about Red, Trace and all the other characters in the next book Dead Plains which is not due to be published until summer 2013. I got a sneak peek at the first chapter at the end of Survivor Roundup. All I'm going to say about it is it will be another fantastical read. I sure am going to miss Red, Trace and everyone else. Summer is a long time to have to wait for the next book. I have so loved reading the Zombie West series and would like to say thanks Angela for writing it and giving me the opportunity to read it.

The undead have surrounded their home, and more keep coming every day. Their stocks dwindle by the day, and she's no longer sure whether they'll survive the winter.

With Survivor Roundup I definitely got my wish granted. This story takes place not too long after the first book in the series ended. Supplies are getting low so Trace and Red decide they will be the ones to go and scout for supplies. Any time they leave the confines of the fort they know they are taking a chance, and those odds haven\u2019t lessened at all. The number of undead seem to be increasing. So they are off and running, and then the unthinkable happens \u2013 they are discovered and separated. This book really tugged on my heart strings at times. I really love these two characters, and their happiness is important to me. They are so good together, that even when they are separated and they don\u2019t even believe the other is alive \u2013 they are still acting like a married couple. During their time apart they could both easily go their separate ways. There were definitely times I was fearful that\u2019s what was happening. But their story definitely wasn\u2019t over. This book has a multitude of different reunions \u2013 and it includes reuniting Red and Trace, thankfully. I\u2019ve become attached to these characters, and I loved reading more about them. The action was terrific in this story. There are monsters that are definitely more scary than the zombies, and that is the monster that is within the living. Everything was definitely amped up in this story. It was very engaging, and I was quickly turning the pages to find out what happens next. There are also some big surprises in this book. One of those looks like it could lead to a book three, so I am crossing my fingers. I definitely want to know how this will be handled, considering that Red is the person that she is. If you read the first book in the Zombie West Series, you will definitely want to continue on with this book."}, {"userName": "Steph", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2142019-steph", "userReview": "... zombies, uglies, nutters, undead, walkers, unfortunates ...

I really enjoyed the first book, Wanted: Dead or Undead, I think the second, Survivor Roundup is even better. I feel like the characters have matured a little in this book and as in the first Ms. Scott creates an amazing dystopian world in the old west. The characters in Survivor Roundup are funny, easy to like and full of complex emotions that we are allowed to see and be a part of. I felt that in this second book the characters are even more approachable and it was easier to dive in and be a part of the book.

The continuity and fluidity of this series\u2019 storyline makes the combining of reviews that much easier. Even if a listener had not heard the installments practically back-to-back, as I did, Angela Scott (the author) makes it extremely easy to jump back into the story as if it never ceased. This also makes it hard for me to recall precisely which installment certain events occurred in, which is not necessarily a negative thing. The continuous nature of the writing is one of the series\u2019 greatest appeals. There were miniscule bits and pieces of the storyline that bothered me from time to time, the main one being the steady weakening of the way the main character was written and my declining opinion of her that went along with it, but it was never enough to murk my overall opinion of her or of the story, in general. There were times towards the end of the second installment and especially in the third when I questioned the way she and Trace were written, but in reality, I was just being nitpicky and impatient. Having finished the series, I can clearly see that now. Which leaves my largest standing complaint as being the extremely graphic, vivid, and revolting descriptions. Before you yell at me, I know this is a zombie series. I\u2019m sure those kinds of descriptions are par for the course among zombie literature and there would probably be a lot more fans upset if that type of thing was excluded or watered down. Heck, the graphic nature of this series may pale in comparison to that of its contemporaries. I don\u2019t read enough zombie stories to know. I\u2019m just saying that, for me, it was a bit much. I quickly learned that I couldn\u2019t listen to this while eating or trying to fall asleep at night. Not big sacrifices. But there were a couple of times when I actually had to stop listening for a period because the descriptions were so stomach-turning. I don\u2019t consider myself overly squeamish either. Mind you, this type of thing may appeal to some listeners, but consider this a warning if you are not one of them. I would find it completely unnecessary and any other type of story, but in a zombie series, I\u2019m guessing mine was probably the intended reaction. And it isn\u2019t like the guts and gore didn\u2019t serve a purpose because that would have really disappointed me. It all added to the story\u2019s atmosphere. This story was woven together exceptionally well with relatable characters, plenty of heart warming moments, and some laughs thrown in as well. Speaking of heartwarming, let\u2019s talk about that epilogue. It positively made my heart swell and also made me ache for a spinoff series set several years in the future. The epilogue set the stage perfectly for that type of thing, should Angela Scott ever feel so inclined. I would definitely, definitely have to get my hands on that. I\u2019m salivating just thinking about it! I felt this series was extremely well-balanced, well-developed, and well-written. The Zombie West series tops my burgeoning list of favorite zombie stories, for sure."}, {"userName": "Sherry Fundin", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9198006-sherry-fundin", "userReview": "Spoiler Alert: Survivor Roundup is Book II in the Zombie West Series by Angela Scott. I could hardly wait to start this book, after finishing Wanted: Dead or Undead, Book I. This is any unlikely story for me to rate 5 STARS, but it is full of suspense and surprises, as it twists its way down the dusty trail. If you like Zombies in any way, shape, or form, this book is a must read.Caroline was having the baby and called for Red. Red was afraid to help. She knew she was different from the others and was afraid of what she might do to the baby when she smelled the blood. Rivers said she would help her and took Red\u2019s hand, leading her to Caroline.The Zombies outside the fort were screaming and howling more than usual. It was like they knew the birth was imminent. When the baby gave its first cry, the Zombies went wild, trying desperately to enter the fort, losing body parts as they walked and climbed over each other, scratching at the doors.Their food supplies were getting very low. They knew they would have to do something, and soon, or they would all starve to death.Red knew she was their first and last line of defense. She would have to go out among the Zombies and open the way for Trace to get the wagon out of the fort. She was shooting and slashing, blood and body parts flying through the air. The blood covered every inch of her body. The plan worked.The rest of her \u201cposse\u201d would be safe in the fort, until they returned.They had been searching for anything of value, anywhere, but came up empty. After two days, they came across a cabin with smoke rising from the chimney. The old woman told them she had nothing to give them. She was barely able to take care of her kids. She told them not to go to Mill Creek, because it was overrun with Zombies, so they knew that was where they had to go.Red entered Mill Creek, walking among the Undead like she was invisible to them. She scavenged whatever she thought they could use.Trace never saw the men coming. What was worse, they saw Red in town with all the Zombies.When Red returned to the wagon, the men descended upon her.What would become of her?Red had a secret and it gave her a reason to survive.What about her posse?5 STARS \u2013 Would Buy It For Them (lol)First off, I am not a big fan of Zombies and haven\u2019t read many Westerns since I used to read my father\u2019s books many years ago. I don\u2019t get into Zombie movies and have not read a lot of Zombie books, but this one was amazing. The book took it to a level that made me want more. It captured my heart and my imagination.Sometimes a second book will not compare to the first, but this just kept getting better and better. I find myself smiling as I picture some of the scenes. Pretty sick, huh? The more I read, the more I liked the story. It made me realize I have missed reading Westerns and will be looking for more of them. The book was so realistic, at times I would forget about the Zombies.The book is very well written and the suspense kept me racing through the pages, wondering how this could end well. I kept thinking, what can you do with the story? Where can it go?The characters seemed so real to me. I loved most of them. But, there must be a bad, evil, black-hatted monster for the white hats to fight and prevail over.I love Rivers. Even though she was only eleven, being raised in the Wild West gave her a maturity that the kids nowadays sorely lack. Due to the harsh living conditions, she was forced to grow up fast. She didn\u2019t think about things much, just did what was necessary.Desperate times call for desperate measures.It seems Man sinks to its lowest, loosing their most evil depravities on humanity, when the chips are down. The most corrupt seem to rise first. Then, it is up to the white hat to take them down. Is that because we dwell on the awful and don\u2019t see the good?The part where the bandits were being attacked by the Zombies was awesome. I could picture the Zombies under the wagon, grabbing the guy and pulling him off his feet. Sounds like something I saw on Supernatural. I love seeing the bad guys get their comeuppance.Munchers, uglies, nutters, undead, walkers, unfortunates.When Angela talks about the young boy eating his own fingers and toes and Red giving him the freshly killed rat, I could picture it. How gruesome. So, be prepared and be afraid.I will be looking for Book III, Dead Plains, due out this fall.I won a signed, first edition, paperback Arc of Wanted: Dead Or Undead, The Zombie West Series Book 1 by Angela Scott, back in December. Then, in April, I won Survivor Roundup, Book 2. The books were screaming at me to be read. I am so glad I won Book 2, because I wanted to start reading it as soon as I finished with Wanted: Dead or Undead. So I can. And you can too.Be sure and read the author bio. I love learning about the authors of the books I read and oftentimes find them as entertaining as the books themselves. Like a super short story.\nAngela Scott"}, {"userName": "Tara Shaw", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4827400-tara-shaw", "userReview": "Hello again, my sweet little cupcakes!!Back so soon? Yes, I know!It\u2019s only because the wonderful author from my last review, Angela Scott, has me hooked on her books!!This round is the second in the Zombie West series, Survivor Roundup!Survivor Round up picks up a few months where Wanted: Dead or Undead left us yearning.Yes, yearning my dears.I did quite a bit of yearning..for about 10 minutes.

Reminds me of my own sisters!This time, we travel alongside the couple from the fort, to an abandoned, but zombie infested town, into an Indian camp, to the last place Red ever thought she\u2019d return to..But fear not! Our heros find more than they ever imagined in three most welcome new friends and return home!Worse for wear, but happy in the end..The third installment to the Zombie West series is due out in October!!So feel free to twiddle your thumbs, lose all focus and wait, oh so impatiently, for the next book!!I know I will!!"}, {"userName": "Tamara! aka Amy G.

How can someone top a 5 Star review, get another one. Admittedly I am fairly stingy with them, but this series has kept me guessing and anticipating the next chapter from the beginning of Wanted: Dead or Undead. A group of strangers brought together in book one, due to various circumstances, some within their control, and others totally out of their control, have gone from strangers to being a family. A changed world surrounds them, and the need for survival is the uppermost thought on everybody's mind. Having found a safe haven, the reality that they will have to move on hits them hard as supplies dwindle and biters gather around their temporary home by the hordes. Even the zombies are hunting for the last vestiges of food in the wilds of the west. What do Red, Trace, and Wen need to do? The answer is the premise of the intense book that is Survivor Roundup. Winter has strapped the group of supplies, everything is running low and with a new mouth to feed, they have to make some hard choices. Trace and Red, the fittest of the bunch head out to scavenge for supplies, promising to return to the group within the fort, return to their family. Red, has changed, in more ways than one. Love, can be both a wanted joy, and a dangerous enemy. For love, we sacrifice much more than we normally might. Here is where Scott marches into a tremendously powerful plot, filled with emotion, action, challenges, and definitely evil. Survivor Roundup is packed with poignant decisions that the characters must make in a split-second or risk death or maybe worse, undeath. Every character is challenged and new characters appear that have been perfectly crafted to fit within the existing story seamlessly. The story is superb, I cannot tell you how deftly Scott has taken you from one book to the next without a hiccup, and moved forward with the plot, only strengthening the foundation of an awesome series. The ending of book two, also was less sappy and more realistic to the story being told... my one tiny criticism for book one. The end was solid and very touching, providing closure on some fronts and opening new doors on others. I personally am 100% addicted to Angela Scott's writing style, and in particular this series, but will definitely be checking out her other series (see below) very soon. I see great promise in Scott's skill and talent, and many more top sellers in her future."}, {"userName": "Ryan Snyder", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4730743-ryan-snyder", "userReview": "3.9/5I had a serious emotional breakdown when I was around 56 percent through with this book. lol. I am going to be honest with you. I had a small problem with one of my beloved characters and almost stopped reading because they were pissing me off. O.O But then I thought about it and a lot of it was overreaction on my part. Some of it was justified because my character just CHANGED and I was a little dumbfounded. But it was a justified change and my character was having a moment, so I decided to let it go. I put my big girl pants on and told myself to stop being a whiny brat and keep reading. It got better and I am happy to say that I still loved the book. Not nearly as much as number one, but it was still good. (: And I am working towards forgiving this character. Not quite there yet.. but working. I will say this though, I was into the book enough that when that one part presented itself, I nearly lost it. haha. You can ask Tiffany, I was venting at her. But it caught my attention and stuck with me and it earned my respect due to that. Any book that can make me attached enough to the characters that when something goes wonky with one of them, I become that upset... well, *shrug* like I said, respect. You guys! There are more characters in this book that I have come to love. *smiles* meep! Oh. *shrug* And a few that I absolutely HATED. whatever, I'm over it. *pouts*I feel like in each book, a new character is added that I just want to hug so hard. lol. and in this book, that character is Kitchi. He was great. (:Also, this book made me smile so hard it hurt in this one part. It was just so hilarious to me and I completely sympathized with Trace. haha. Smiling just thinking about it. \"KAW!\" *giggle*And then BAM another part made me want to curl up in a ball. D:There was some serious darkness in this book and at some points I was just like... O.O You are going to break my heart, you MONSTER. lol. But.. I kind of loved it. I know, I know, I'm SICK. Also, WHOAH, Villain alert. O.O That is one crazy B*****d. *shudders*So.. all in all? The second book was slap full of some new and AWESOME characters with unique personalities, and plenty of dry humor. There was some crazy darkness, but there is still that fantastic underlying since of family love and devotion. Oh, right. Can't forget about those crazy zombies! :D They were all \"IMA EAT CHOO\" and people were all... \"OMA GAWD! D:\" It was great. :D"}, {"userName": "Meganm922", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327196-meganm922", "userReview": "review originally posted at Love Literature Art and ReasonSurvivor Roundup was action packed and full of zombie mayhem. I loved the plot and the way the series seems to be progressing. It had me on the edge of my seat, especially when Trace and Red got separated. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, if either of them would live in their new circumstances, and if they would find each other again.It was so agonizing to see the two characters separated. Trace was injured and inside of an Indian camp. Red was kidnapped by people who saw the Wanted posters. I was so worried about both of them and also worried about the people around them. An Indian girl tended to Trace\u2019s wounds and was giving him googly eyes, while one of Red\u2019s captors was being super nice to her. My brain was screaming NO NO NO! the entire time. Survivor Roundup mirrored some of the same type of set up as in The Walking Dead in season 3 with the compound that seemed to work relatively well under the supervision of one man who is thought to bring hope to everyone. And much like in the show, that place wasn\u2019t all it was cracked up to be, but that wasn\u2019t news to Red. The man running the compound was the same man who did all sorts of horrible things to her. I was happy to see Red handle things the way she did. I really love her character. She\u2019s always tough. I liked the plot and the way the author kept me on my toes by separating the two characters and intertwining their stories. The zombie horror was awesome, too. I absolutely love the way the author writes about the zombie apocalypse. It\u2019s terrifying and gory and gross, but the plot revolves around the characters, too. I\u2019m invested in the story and the fate of the characters, while also being thoroughly entertained by the zombie mayhem. The fact that it\u2019s all set in the Wild West makes it even more interesting, especially with the addition of the Indians in this book.I definitely recommend the series and I\u2019m glad that Survivor Roundup was a wonderful addition to the series. I still think I liked the first book more, but I\u2019m excited to continue and see what happens to the characters in the following book."}, {"userName": "Laura Thomas", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7491783-laura-thomas", "userReview": "The story picks up where it left off. The author gave me just enough back information to catch up and then the story took off, pulling me back in time, to the west and the characters I\u2019ve come to love.The relationship between Trace and Red strengthens now that some of their secrets have been shared.Red and Trace head out to gather much need provisions, making it past the horde outside. Their journey takes them to Mill Creek.The town is like undead central, zombies everywhere. Red\u2019s secret comes in handy as she slips past the zombies as if she\u2019s invisible, scrounging up as much as she can and heading back to Trace, waiting at the wagon. The zombies might not have noticed her, but others did, and now they want Red.She may have made it past the horde, but will they survive what\u2019s coming? Either of them?I always to into the next book in a series with a bit of trepidation. Will it give me the answers I seek? Will it be as good as the first book?My fears were allayed in the first chapter. Survivor Roundup is as awesome as Wanted: Dead or Undead.I\u2019m also big on character driven stories, so the group dynamics were important. Those of you who watch apocalyptic movies and read the books know it\u2019s not just about surviving the cause of it. It\u2019s also about making those life and death decisions, recognizing trouble when it raises its ugly head, and compromising when necessary. Their has to be give and take if the group is to survive. The author had me so wrapped up in her characters lives. Even the ones I couldn\u2019t stand.And for you die-hard zombie fans. Angela can write those gut-clenching, gory, munching and hacking scenes. What\u2019s a good zombie story without some gnashing and slaying. She does this so well I\u2019d call it writing in color.The ending for the first book was hopeful. One of the best I\u2019ve read. The ending for this one is darker, harder to take, and you do get left hanging. But that\u2019s what a series is all about. Just like your favorite TV show, you can\u2019t wait for the next episode.And there\u2019s a big surprise waiting for you in this one.

Zombie books are one of my favourite reads, and when I was given a zombie western to review, I was intrigued but figured that it would not work. I almost willed myself to hate it, being a die hard zombie book fan, but the opposite happened. How wrong I was, I grabbed this sequel as soon as I could to hear more of the characters Red and Trace. Their stories have moved on somewhat, and it is as atmospheric and gripping as the first was before it. I loved Nash, which was a surprise to me for reasons that become apparent when you read it, and the integration of characters old and new is brilliant. To pull off an accurate western book is hard: to chuck a load of zombies into the mix and still make the story realistic, endearing, shocking and unputdownable too is an awesome feat, and Angela Scott pulls this off with aplomb. I have only one question: when is book 3 out?One not to be missed, in my opinion.

The zombies are awesome too cause who doesn't love a little zombie action?Again, the people of The Zombie West books are trying to keep away from the zombies and fight for survival. These books are about hardship, rough times, survival, laughter, friendship, love...*swoon* They are just fantastic.
