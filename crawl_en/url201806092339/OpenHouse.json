It's been sitting on my bookshelf for the longest time just waiting to reach the top of my TBR. Samantha Morrow is 42, has an 11 year old son Travis and is happy in her life and her marriage. Unfortunately her husband is not happily married, has moved out and decided they'll be divorced. Sam is devastated and simply doesn't know how to make this new life work. I'm fortunate not to have experienced this first hand however Berg certainly made this experience real for me. Sam is insistent upon staying in the family home so to enble this she decides to rent out a couple of rooms. She also decides to find work for the first time in her adult life. With wonderful skill Berg managed to bring her characters to life and with them I traversed their journey and experienced the gamut of associated emotions. There were some light moments, even some humourous ones and the author managed to shine a light on human relationships of various shapes and sizes. Fortunately Elizabeth Berg was selected as the BT Author read for December. I've read a couple of her titles and have enjoyed each one and this was no exception. Given it's only the 2nd of the month I might try to squeeze in another of her titles before the month is out. If you enjoy womens fiction you could certainly do worse than this and I'm very glad to have finally read this book."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie", "userReview": "Elizabeth Berg might just be my favorite author for a guaranteed, enjoyable comfort read. I may need to keep one of her books handy at all times. Her stories are true to life, her characters are relatable and I tend to fly through her books and end them with a sense of satisfaction for time well spent. This was no different. Samantha \"Sam\" is sailing along in her marriage, keeping a home for her husband and Mothering her son Travis, but when her husband leaves her the boat capsizes and leaves her rather adrift. She starts to question everything in her life. After her initial shock, (and rather fun reactions....which includes a call to Martha Stewart and a shopping trip at Tiffany's) she gets busy trying to create a new life for herself and her son. She backslides some but gets quite a bit of help from her no nonsense friend Rita, \"clueless\" Mother and a new friend, King. Her son Travis even offers up quite a bit of 11 year old advice.....mostly, \"You really are crazy!\" This is a thoughtful and often humorous look at the end of a marriage and one way of life...and all the new avenues that can open up to you if you are willing to travel them. I would imagine many women have been in the same place....or helped someone close to them through it. The story is not all feel good, but somehow you know it will end up well. \u201cI remove my wedding rings and put them in the jewelry box. So many others have done this. I am not the only one. I am not the only one. But here, I am the only one.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Janice Williams", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3574288-janice-williams", "userReview": "I read \"Open House\" by Elizabeth Berg for the first time four years ago. I discovered her books at the library and read all of Berg\u2019s titles available there, then purchased some additional titles as well. I\u2019ve now read all of her books except, oddly considering my profession, her book on writing, which I haven\u2019t finished yet. A few weeks ago, I decided to purchase paperback editions and re-read a few of Berg\u2019s books. I started with Open House.I\u2019ve just now gone to Berg\u2019s site to grab a short synopsis, and see that Open House was published by Random House in 2000. This novel was the author\u2019s first (written), but not the first she had published. Here is the synopsis from Elizabeth-Berg.net.A woman whose husband has moved out decides that, rather than selling their house, she will keep it and rent out rooms to boarders. This novel, which was an Oprah pick, is about finding the gifts inside yourself that you've ignored or not been aware of. It emphasizes the fact that sometimes it takes a tragedy to get you to the best place you can be. Here is mine:When husband David leaves Samantha after many years of marriage, Sam first reacts by imitating Martha Stewart in an attempt to create the perfect home for her and her 11-year-old son, Travis. When this soon wanes, Sam, determined to keep the family home, opens the doors of her house and the doors of her heart to a few strangers and a man named King, who has a degree in astrophysics and works for a temp agency. Sam starts working there, too, and as the book progresses, Berg weaves the story of how a person\u2019s heart can heal and open to the beauty of the world around them once again, even when they are so profoundly changed by circumstances that they may feel unrecognizable to their former selves. When Sam faces what she thought she once longed for, and makes a surprising decision, some readers may recognize having been faced with a similar dilemma as time marches on and our old dreams boomerang back in our faces, challenging our new desires.Open House is not simply my favorite Elizabeth Berg book; it is one of my very favorite books ever. This is because it is well-written, well-woven, and I can relate to much of the storyline. My first marriage lasted about the same length as fictional character Samantha\u2019s. My boys were about the same age as Sam\u2019s son, Travis. I, too, had to figure out how to earn money, how to handle a life that had suddenly changed in what felt like every single way, how to parent pre-teen sons and in that process re-invent myself, or find myself, or just grow and change, like many people do. But this commonplace process takes extraordinary strength, I believe (not compared to humanity but compared to what we might have been called upon before to have), and Berg seems to think so also. She blends strength and a fragile sensitivity into the character of Sam (as well as King), and this makes the main character someone you would want as your best friend; someone you want to be happy and to be loved.As a writer, I find it impressive that in the 241 pages of Open House the author has created endearing characters and a story that touched me so deeply because as I read it I thought, Yes, that! I did that same thing. I felt that same way. This is the magic of Berg\u2019s writing, in this book and in others. If you haven\u2019t yet discovered her books, start with one of her many titles soon. Note: This is not a paid review, nor a requested review, and I have never worked with Elizabeth Berg, though I have liked her Facebook page.~Janice Phelps Williams, writer, illustrator at www.janicephelps.comAuthor of \u201cOpen Your Heart with Pets: Mastering Life through Love of Animals\u201d (Transformation Publishing 2012)"}, {"userName": "Dylan", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2491754-dylan", "userReview": "Open House is a celebration of self-absorption, self-centeredness and self-pity in women. The book centers on a recent divorcee, Sam, who whines incessantly and feels sorry for herself. Sam reads like a misogynist\u2019s idea of what a woman is, alternating between a nagging, vindictive shrew and an emotional, ultra-sensitive, self-pitying sad-sack who\u2019s always one slight away from crying. Seriously, why exactly are we supposed to give a damn about this pathetic individual? There are people like this in real life and they do deserve help, of the psychiatric kind; that doesn\u2019t mean their self-centered antics have to be celebrated or legitimized in \u201cliterature\u201d (if an Oprah Book Club pick can count under that distinction). Talking about self-centeredness, there\u2019s a slobbering interview with author Elizabeth Berg featured in the back of the book, in which she says \u201cA lot of men have told me that my books help them understand their women better...\u201d. If I thought there was even the slightest truth to the notion that most women behave like this, and not just a certain sector of Oprah-loving upper-class divorcees who feel like the world owes them something, it would be enough for me to swear off the female sex for life. What makes the whining and self-pitying of Sam so perverse is that, by all accounts, she lives a really good life. Better than most of us do. She\u2019s never had to work a day in her life. She lives a luxurious, upper-class lifestyle. Even after the breakdown of her marriage, she gets to keep the house, and the fact that she needs to bring in tenants to help with the pay is treated as some major life-changing development rather than the reality it is for most people. Here\u2019s someone who has had everything handed to her on a platter in life and yet cries, whines, and never learns a goddamn thing. There are people struggling to pay their bills, people starving to death in third-world countries, people suffering with severe disabilities and mental illness, and all she can do is whine about how her divorce is the end of the world. Look, I get that divorce can be a hugely upsetting and catastrophic event in some people\u2019s lives \u2013 my parents divorced, but they never took it as cart blanche to forgo all their responsibilities and act like immature children. Among the litany of Sam\u2019s offenses: -\tAfter finding a pair of her husband\u2019s dirty boxers in the laundry, she buries her face in them and tries to inhale the scent. Then, she sews up the fly on the boxers. If you think this was some stupid spur-of-the-moment decision, to quote Sam, \u201cWith great care, I do this, with tenderness\u201d. Oh yeah, in case that wasn\u2019t enough: \u201cThen I go back to the pile of laundry and get some of his fancy socks and sew the tops of them shut\u201d. -\tDetermined to live in \u201celegance\u201d following the divorce, Sam decides she will make her son freshly-squeezed orange juice...despite the fact that he doesn\u2019t like it. When he says she doesn\u2019t have to make it, she insists. When he asks for a glass of Tropicana from the fridge instead, she refuses. When he asks if they\u2019re out of it, she lies and says yes. When he opens the fridge and sees the jug of juice, she dumps it down the sink. That will show the stupid kid for wanting a glass of juice. -\tSam insists on being the one to break the news to her son about the divorce. Then, she tells her son that the reason for the divorce is because his dad is self-centered and she hates him. Following this outburst, she begins to mope about her bad breath, gray hair and cellulite rather than the fact, you know, that she just horribly upset her son.-\tDeciding not to resort to vindictive pettiness, Sam goes to \"Tiffanys\" and charges $12,000 worth of stuff she has no need for to her husband\u2019s credit card. She\u2019s then shocked when her husband freezes their account and cuts her off. -\tShe eavesdrops on her son and his friend. When she hears them playing a harmless prank call on a girl in their class, she storms into the room, takes a bag of cookies from the friend and decides she will lecture her son on how to treat women properly. Prank phone calls? No. Charging $12,000 to someone else\u2019s credit card? Sure, why not?-\tSam goes on a blind date with a man. She acts like a real floozy, kissing him in the restaurant and asking \u201cShould we do it here? Or should we go and make out in the car with the heater turned up?\u201d They end up back at his place, where they begin making love to each other. Midway through, she asks this man playfully, with a laugh, to stop. When he doesn\u2019t, she tells him seriously to stop. He immediately stops. Sure, he is mean to her afterward, but he does stop. Then she goes home, tells the man who is babysitting her son as a favor that all men are assholes, and then claims she was date-raped, \u201cAlmost\u201d. So you ask a guy to stop and he does, and that\u2019s date-rape? You wanna try telling that to a woman has actually suffered through the trauma of date rape, Sam?-\tAfter getting a temporary week-long job literally doing nothing but sitting behind a desk and making change, Sam is offered a full-time position. She turns it down. She says she can\u2019t commit to a full-time job. Really, what the hell else do you have to do? If you actually have the time to delicately sew the flies shut on your husband\u2019s boxers, I think you have time for a job. -\tSam prepares a Thanksgiving dinner for herself. She mixes all the food on her plate, and when she doesn\u2019t like the look of it, dumps all the perfectly good food down the garbage disposal. Meanwhile, somewhere out-there is a family of four starving. -\tThroughout Open House, Sam rents out rooms in her house to different tenants. If I remember correctly, at one time or another she enters each of these tenant\u2019s rooms without their knowledge and pokes around, lies on their beds and just plain out invades their privacy. As a final note, besides the general nastiness of Sam, I was fairly disturbed by the abundance of racist and homophobic stereotypes throughout Open House. I consider myself a fairly politically incorrect person; it takes quite a bit to offend me. However, even I was a little put off by some of the characterizations in Open House. There\u2019s a black guy who carries a boom-box blasting rap music, a black mom begging for change on a street corner with her kid, an old Asian Laundromat owner with \u201ctea-colored teeth\u201d who speaks in broken English with monosyllabic phrases such as \u201cDetective!\u201d and \u201cDumb\u201d, a flamboyantly gay hairdresser, and a teenager who is, of course, an emo. We get 241 pages about the troubles of middle-aged, upper-class, white women and you can't throw in a single minority character that isn't a stereotype straight out of the 1920's."}, {"userName": "Suede", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8253-suede", "userReview": "Next time I find myself thinking that I need a really easy read, I'll edit my thought to be \"I need an easy, BUT STILL WORTHWHILE, read.\"Although I hate to love, and love to hate on Oprah and her book club books, they usually are pretty decent.

I've been enjoying Elizabeth Berg's books since I picked up a copy of Say When at my library in 2004-- since then I haven't read one I didn't enjoy a great deal...until now. This story was awkward, weird, and depressing. The characters were very hard to connect with, or even like. Finally, the conflicts were tied up with a neat, tidy, and abrupt bow in the end while glossing over a great deal of pain and trauma. It also had the feel of trying too hard to be something it wasn't.

Berg described feelings and characters in such detail that I was eager to read more of her work.

I was debating between 4 and 5 stars because I kept thinking about what would happen at the end and I was really into the book.The last 1/4, I wanted to throw it out the window. I don't like to review with spoilers because I like to think my friends occasionally use my reviews to help their next choice for what to read, like I do with most books. :) Anyway, there was an incredibly unbelievable plot twist that totally ruined it for me. I no longer saw Sam as a real person but rather a fictional character who was desperate and cheesy and all the things she didn't seem in the first half.

I flipped a page, like I'd just been doing from the first, and now I realize I have no more pages to flip! Its finished. And I am wondering what an ending should do to me as a reader, leave me wanting more, hanging or just plain bored. Well, this book was certainly entertaining. Even incredibly readable. The perfect kind to take you into another world, wherein you find life true, almost familiar.After her husband leaves her, Sam wants to recreate her life. First there is the issue of dealing with her 11 year old son. What is he to know, how much, when and how? Then there is her mother who thinks that Sam needs to move on, date, have fun, and live. While she looks at her son and feels like a cheap failure, she looks at her mother and remembers the loss of her father, and how the mother went on to date man after man. Sam cannot find one thing she likes about herself. She even thinks of accidental death. Rather desperate and torn, Sam is ready to do anything. But she would not let go of her house. With little money to her credit, she opens up her house to borders to in the hope of getting a little help in paying the mortgage. But each of the three individual come with their own set of worldviews, some good, some bad. But each in their own way impact on her life. This is an immensely readable book.

This is probably the fifth or sixth time I've read it, and it never gets old.On its surface, it seems like a familiar story: husband abandons wife, wife is crushed, her circumstances and responsibility to her child force her to pick herself up and eventually embrace life again.But Berg's writing is heartbreakingly beautiful and poignant, her characters so real and funny and likeable. Berg can move me to tears and make me laugh, often in the same sentence. She's so good that reading her books makes me want to throw my hands in the air and say, \"I give up!\" when it comes to my own writing.For example, to show tenderness and love, she has a man take off a woman's glasses, clean them for her, and gently replace them. Who but Berg would think of that? I seriously have savoured every line in this novel.It's how she never fails to make ordinary life extraordinary, and how she connects seemingly disconnected things.

I understand how devastating a divorce can be, but was thoroughly irritated by how pathetic Sam became (at one point even throwing herself at the very man who abandoned her and her son). I could've really gotten behind this character and cheered for her if she had pulled herself up, quit feeling sorry for herself, and strived to create a new life for herself. She did eventually do that but I still felt that she was letting life happen to her rather than living life. Also, while reading the book, you get the sense that the time span is over several months, when actually the whole book takes place inside of a couple of months. So basically, if you nothing else to read, then by all means curl up with this book.

I cared about the key characters. Alot of what happens in the book felt true to life, and I particularly enjoyed the relationships between Sam and her son, and Sam and her mother. I also thought that Berg used her secondary characters, the people who roomed at Samantha's, quite well. The evolution of the characters was good. The plot was engaging, overall. Some of the imagery is quite stunning.So why not a full five stars? I've struggled with that; I read this book ages ago and I've avoided reviewing it because I've been torn. The problem is that although the book was good, it wasn't particularly great. In the first three or four chapters, it seems like Berg is going to really let Samantha struggle, and we're going to get to see some of the real pain a person can feel as they rebuild from a separation. The problem is she never quite goes far enough; the emotional depth isn't quite there. Everything seems to be wrapped up too quickly and easily. I wanted to get a better understanding of who David was, and why the marriage broke up (to be fair to Berg, she does write some effective flashbacks, and this really is Sam's story, not Sam and David's story). And I wanted to like the character of King more. He was just goofy to me.In short, if you want a book that's well written and a fast read, you'll like this book. If you're looking for something with really deep insights into how a woman recovers from her husband suddenly walking out, this book doesn't quite live up to it's potential.

I recommend it to anyone who wishes to be amused by the antics of a recently separated woman (\"Sam\") with an 11-year-old son, who takes on a roommate to help pay the mortgage. The subsequent revolving roommates are absolute characters who add immensely to the drama. Sam's preteen son's indifferent, sometimes nasty attitude is right on (I would know). I loved the other characters in the book as well. Sam's long-distance friend, Rita, is blunt and honest and over-the-top but at least you know where she stands; and her new friend \"King\" is likable and sweet (the way they meet is quite interesting). What a great friend he turns out to be. King not only hooks Sam up with a temporary job agency but babysits for her as well. The story follows Sam as she struggles with her sadness and low self-esteem after her husband leaves her, how she handles her intrusive mother and grudgingly accepted blind dates, and how she \"finds\" and finally loves herself. The ending will surprise you. Really. It will.Elizabeth Berg's writing is similar to Jennifer Weiner, whom I adore. She's witty, funny and surprisingly - very surprisingly at points - straightforward. Throughout the book I giggled like a school girl, grinned like a circus clown or laughed out loud. Can't wait to read her other books.If there was a 1/2 star, I would probably give it 4 1/2.

The first thing I noticed is that it is kind of dated: characters still watch movies via VHS tapes, and people still calculated long distance phone call costs. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the book felt like a historical novel in that sense. I found this book very weird: it seems like Berg couldn't decide on the tone of the book. It starts out sad and wistful, but she goes into comedic situations. And I never understood why Samantha needed borders, when it was established her husband was rich. So a lot of things confused me. But, it's very much readable and never boring. Still weird, though."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/584609-beth", "userReview": "In this book, Samantha, a woman in her forties with an eleven year old son, must face her grief, helplessness, and frustration when her husband leaves her. She ends up renting rooms in her house and taking temporary jobs to make ends meet. Through these, she meets characters who help her boost her confidence and build a new life. I love Elizabeth Berg's writing and the way she develops realistic characters, so the only reason I gave the book less than 5 stars was because I felt Samantha was a little pathetic and weak."}, {"userName": "Martha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7344161-martha", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3873886-karen", "userReview": "A sweet, easy read.

I think my brain just sucked up the words greedily like a kid with candy on Halloween because it was easier fare.This is my first Berg book and I have seen her work touted all about the book blogosphere. She does have a way with making everyday simple actions, settings and emotions quite remarkable and relatable to her readers. This story opens with a woman feeling the sucker punch of being left by her husband for reasons she doesn't quite understand. She is lost and a bit of a mess - except for her 11 year old son. She has an odd fascination with Martha Stewart, has humorous and continual incorrect internal assumptions about those she meets, and struggles to find her way earning a living. She takes in roommates to help with the mortgage and they also help to mend her heart.It is a fairly predictable tale, one that I have read in several variations with the same general result a few times over the last year. So the plot itself is nothing outstanding, but the way that Berg shares the private thoughts and emotions of her main character is very touching. Right from the beginning your are on her side, nodding your head all the way through in support of her stumbles and eventual discoveries of confidence and self-worth.The characters are vibrant, the plot is flat. A nice book to spend a few days with - especially to offset those that require lots of study."}, {"userName": "Alexa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4014456-alexa", "userReview": "The main character of this book is a little down trodden, a little mopey, and didn't show nearly enough spunk, even at the end, but still, I couldn't help but like her. Her main romantic interest is also likable, and though their romance, such as it is, did not exactly spark a fire in me, it was sweet. I also liked that neither character started out gorgeous or had a major makeover to become gorgeous. Other than that, there's not a whole lot positive to say. The book reads as more of a chronicle of divorce than as a romance or even a novel. It feels more like a journal than anything and, like a journal, it's long on emotion and short on plot. What little plot there is is ridiculously predictable--as though the plot isn't really the point. And I don't think it is. I think this is MEANT to read as a chronicle of a middle-aged woman with low confidence who more or less cobbles her life back together when her husband leaves her. Her heartbreak is very real, and her upswing is realistically imperfect, and while I liked the sense of realism, the book lacked sparkle. I LIKE romances/chick lit that is unrealistically positive at the end, when the main character gets to kick some ass and take some names. Here, she comes into her own a bit, but there's not enough of a character arc to make the entirely character-driven story pack much punch.Also, I hated her best friend, who makes her feel bad about herself, a situation which is never resolved or even dealt with."}, {"userName": "Sterlingcindysu", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946086-sterlingcindysu", "userReview": "A satisfying read, great character development and a good pace.

A new friend, King, an untraditional man, suggests that Samantha get out, get going, get work.

I come from a split marriage, so it's a topic I kind of like to avoid. I was pulled, though, for some reason. The first couple of chapters were a bit depressing and difficult to get through, but by chapter four, I was hooked and wanted to keep reading to see how Sam, the main character, would develop throughout the pages. Berg did an amazing job at character and plot development, but she could have incorporated a few more light-hearted moments. In sum, though, the book in itself was extremely virtuous. It was moving and I found myself not wanting to put it down! I found in the end that it wasn't so much a book about the emotional paralysis of divorce insomuch as it was about one woman's triumph over it, and her self-renewal/awakening throughout the process. She learned that she had to learn to love herself first before she could love any other man, other than (of course) her 11-year old son, Travis. The ending was so sweet, I wanted to savor it-- it made me realize that sometimes, happiness really can triumph over moments of despair in life.
