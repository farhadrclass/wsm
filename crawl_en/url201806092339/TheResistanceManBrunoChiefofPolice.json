The loving descriptions of food, wine, dinners among friends, life in the French countryside... oh, yes, and there is a murder or two as well, a mystery to solve, to keep things interesting. This is the second book I've read in the series and I can't get enough of it. Maybe, after a full dose of all 6 books, I might feel a bit bloated and as if I had over-indulged at the dinner table. But there is also canny and topical political commentary, and a keen observation of cultural differences which keeps this series fresh and interesting."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "Benoit Courreges, Chef de Police in St Denis and known to everyone as Bruno, was enjoying a relaxing morning out in the garden with his two geese, Napoleon and Josephine plus the chickens and pheasants he had procured for their delicious eggs, while he was attempting to train his basset hound puppy Balzac. Teaching Balzac to treat his feathered friends with courtesy was beginning to work as Bruno found this breed of dog to be highly intelligent. But as his phone vibrated in his pocket and he was distracted, Balzac charged towards the chickens where a furious squawking and flapping of wings ensued. Grabbing Balzac Bruno apologised to the local priest, Father Sentout then proceeded to learn of the death of Resistance veteran Murcoing \u2013 his death was to start a string of events which had begun in 1944 with the legendary train robbery at Neuvic by the French Resistance; 2,280 million francs had never been recovered. (approximately $400 million in today\u2019s money)With burglaries occurring in isolated homes where all that was taken were valuable antiques, Bruno was shocked to learn of another one \u2013 this time at the home of the former head of Britain\u2019s Joint Intelligence Committee, Jack Crimson. And with the investigation barely started he was called to the site of a vicious and brutal murder. What on earth was happening in his quiet little town? As Bruno began to source facts about the players in both investigations, he discovered some alarming information \u2013 it seemed there were secrets within the political arena which just could link the Neuvic robbery with the events that were currently taking place. Suddenly the danger was deadly; could Bruno sort the tangled web before there was another murder? This is my first by Martin Walker, so of course my first about Bruno, Chef de Police. A thoroughly enjoyable character, he even has his own website! http://www.brunochiefofpolice.com/! The author\u2019s information at the back of the novel tells of the July 1944 Neuvic Resistance train robbery and the fact the money was never recovered \u2013 it occurred exactly as it has been portrayed in this book. A gripping and intriguing thriller which I have no hesitation in recommending.With thanks to TRR and the publisher for my copy to read and review."}, {"userName": "Loretta", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4511561-loretta", "userReview": "I see that most people give this a four star. And although I did enjoy reading the story, I felt the train robbery was a weak thread that did not hold the real events together very well. It was almost like Mr Walker had read about the event and decided it would make a good tale, but there wasn't enough info to work with, so he added a murder too.The title is another problem for me. Again, the Resistance Man had little if anything to do with the major action in the story.And you know, Bruno is just going to have to get his act together and find a good wife. I am not particularly fond of any of his women ( no, I am not jealous of them ) but none of them have the depth or mettle to match him."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11410659-jim", "userReview": "This sixth novel focusing on Police Chief Bruno of the fictional Perigord commune of St. Denis again not only tells a cracking good mystery but also makes you want to travel to see the world in which Bruno and his author live. The life, history and culture of the Perigord compete in the best sense with the narrow mystery and chase aspects of this novels and put it well above the normal European mystery."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2598826-lesley", "userReview": "I adore this series...

Although the story is not worth 5 stars, I always enjoy learning about some new aspects of the Dordogne (which I know well) or French history that I hadn't heard of before. In this novel I learnt about the biggest train robbery of all time, which really did happen in Neuvic in 1944, making many people, including Andr\u00e9 Malraux, become suddenly rich. Fascinating! Woven around that is a historically accurate account of the secret U.S. assistance to the French nuclear program after 1970, and a storyline about gays, burglaries, and illegal antique trading. So, all in all, Martin Walker has given us a cozy mystery with a bonus.

The setting of the Perigord in France is perfect. The food, the wine and the easy and spontaneous camaraderie of a small rural French village enchanting. Bruno, as the main protagonist is smart, kind and likeable although I can't say as much for the two women in his life. Neither seem to recognize his 'specialness' enough to deserve him. I mean really...the guy is charming, sensitive and can cook..what more could a girl ask for? The mystery in this instalment shed some light on an interesting part of France's history - the French Resistance and a great train robbery. However, I was somewhat disappointed in the storyline as I figured out the real 'bad guy' about halfway through- I hate when that happens. However, that aside, it's still a great yarn, a deserving instalment in the series and well worth the read."}, {"userName": "Shirley Schwartz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278399-shirley-schwartz", "userReview": "I absolutely love this series and I love Bruno and his friends. This book is more of a manhunt than a mystery. Bruno is worlking with several local police agencies trying to find the man that violently mutilated and killed a gay man behind a bar. At the same time there has been a series of antiques burglaries in St. Denis and a former veteran of the Resistance passes away from natural causes. Among this old fellow's possessions are historical documents that hint at his involvement in an infamous train robbery during WWII that netted the Resistance a pile of money. The further Bruno digs, the more he realizes that all these events are connected. I enjoyed the book, but it fell a bit for me this time because there was really no mystery. As usual, I loved all the historical information about the French Resistance and French nuclear program, and I loved all the food and wine references. The beautiful Dordogne area is a foodie's mecca, The book does set up nicely at the end for the next one because Bruno finds out some devastating personal news that rocks his world just when the tension of the hunt is at it's highest.

If you like the Bruno series, you will like this installment. This time, the timely and heavy topic is American interference in Western European elections during the Cold War. And somehow that's just weaved into the background of a crime mystery and Bruno also goes horseback riding with his puppy in the countryside. It's something brilliant how Martin Walker does this.The narration of the series is quite good. Often with audiobooks set in France, the pronunciation of French is horrifying, but this reader does a nice job of keeping French words comprehensible to English speakers without butchering the local lingo."}, {"userName": "Michael Brown", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26793984-michael-brown", "userReview": "Bruno is a trouble magnet. And outside of a few minor injuries his friends seem to suffer the most. No international terrorism or hidden bigotry this time. Just your usual house break-ins, murder and old grudges from the Vichy days of WWII. We learn of an old train robbery where the resistance plundered the French reserves enroute to a safe haven with the Germans near the end of the war. Some money was recovered, some was known to go to various people involved and much more just vanished. This sub plot weaves through our tale as Bruno hunts down an antigue ring specializing in stripping the homes of absent owners and leaving almost no clues. When a body shows up at one possible site the case jumps to a priority level even getting the intelligence services involved. A bit slow but then most of these books are best read slowly to catch all the little hints and to appreciate the local history and background material that makes them a change from the norm."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37849031-elizabeth", "userReview": "Bruno has complications with his romantic relationships in this installment of the series. That brought a very human element to the characters that really moved me. The mystery plot itself was intriguing, but at times the action dragged. Involving a civilian in one of the action sequences was not at all believable. New professional characters were introduced and at times that was confusting. Overall, I really enjoyed the book, though at times I wish the pace had been quicker, as it has been in other Bruno mysteries."}, {"userName": "Andrea Seiffertt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51530625-andrea-seiffertt", "userReview": "***MAJOR SPOILERS*** But I'm not blocking it out because I hope Martin Walker reads this. I'm so disappointed, since I loved the first 5 books- I was primarily reading them for the food/wine, the bits of history, and the light but sweet and realistic romance (and the rather far-fetched and simple wrap ups of the mysteries). But there are 2 glaringly horrible problems with book 6:1. Perpetuating stereotypes of gay men as generally pedophiles AND *either* criminals or artists (and nothing else despite several gay characters in the book) is reprehensible. If that part of France is still largely alt-right like the US, fine, say that, but do NOT by your characterizations and plot make true/normal the stereotypes those kinds of people use as a defense for their prejudice and bigotry. Unless you are 'those people,' which means I'll actively tell people to avoid buying your books.2. Isabelle, as she has been written for 5 previous books, and if she was not on birth control for whatever reason, would NOT have been so ridiculous as to not know she was ovulating during a one-off sexual encounter and not taken precautions since she was 100% set against having children. If she's the way she's written, she'd have had an IUD this entire time, full stop. These aren't teenagers who haven't been taught sex ed. And Bruno, if he's the 'gentleman' you've written him as so far, would have understood her previous decision and they'd have had the adult conversation that needs to be had before engaging in a sexual relationship long before that night--- and whatever understanding about who'd bring the condoms should have been long previously discussed and acted on. It isn't that I'm saying she wouldn't have considered having a child with Bruno, or that she should have done something different, or even that his train of thought wasn't understandable-it's that this plot device is so outside her character that it makes no sense-- and further, having it be 'unforgivable' without argument is to blame and shame and demean women who've had to make that decision for any reason. (Secondarily, the morning-after pill would have made 100% more sense if she did indeed have a passionate idiotic moment, I'm 100% certain she'd have realized it quickly enough).I also considered that maybe you're trying to make an argument about Isabelle's subconscious desires and that the only true fulfillment for a woman (or a man or any gender) is to be a mother (or a father)? If so, I'm extra sorry I wasted money on your book.There are good ways to handle issues like these two that affect so many people, Mr Walker, and you've done it quite badly, I'm sorry to say."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789615-alan", "userReview": "The Bruno Chief of Police series is one of my annual favourites, but this one fell a bit short of my usual 5 star rating for the books that feature the rural policeman in the Perigord region of France.The usual touchstones of the series were in place, i.e. a meal cooked by Bruno for his friends with its preparation lovingly described, the interactions with his basset hound and his horse, the camaraderie with friends such as the Mayor and J.J., and, of course, the ongoing dynamic of the relationships with Pamela and Isabelle.What missed the mark for me was a too-quick resolution in the space of the final few pages of the book with no reflection or discussion. It just ended too abruptly and something felt missing.Partly this was because the title \"The Resistance Man\" and the entire setup of the book (a cover tagline reads \"War casts the longest shadow. A case for Bruno, chef de police) leads one to expect that the book will centre around some modern day results or solutions of the July 26, 1944 Train Robbery in Neuvic by the French Resistance of the Banque de France reserves of which a large portion remains suspiciously unaccounted for. This however becomes a very minor subplot to the main crime and mystery story that Bruno is called upon to solve.So, nothing wrong with the book, I just had slightly different expectations about the story and they weren't quite satisfied. It seems like the marketing led this one astray for me.Regardless, I am a Bruno fan still, and eagerly await the next one."}, {"userName": "Michelle L", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4423562-michelle-l", "userReview": "It's Bruno's sixth, and my sixth, in this usually satisfying series. This time around I have to agree with those who felt it lacked depth, despite the presence of several supposed emotional crossroads for not only Bruno, but the mayor and Isabelle. They were there, like signposts, but they didn't reverberate.It's also true that the title meant nothing in terms of what the story beneath the plot supposedly was about. When you find yourself wondering from time to time \"What resistance man?\" instead of reading on, something's out of kilter.There's also been a disturbing evolution of Bruno into something of an Ayn Rand character. He's just a little too free-standing lately, even arrogant in his way. His circle is too self--satisfied. It doesn't feel like a circle of well-off, well-meaning, and responsibly-acting influentials; more like a developing power structure beyond the civil structure. In fact, until now, I hadn't realized just how far that's gone.

Now with the completion of his sixth novel in his \"Bruno, Chief of Police\" series has moved to an intricate plot relating to a significant historical event from his early cozy story of crime events in his beautiful Dordogne with magnificent food and wine. The Resistance Man includes references to the wine and even includes his favorite wines in a robbery. There is little talk of cooking, only passing references to the gardens and cooking, and no mention of truffles. Fortunately, he still has a dog. I missed this cozy food talk. The more intricate plot was interesting and made his work appear more sophisticated. It appeared to have been sketched and charted before he wrote the book. I think he spent more time on his plot than on his writing. His paragraphs seemed rougher than his earlier work.

This book is in the middle of the series so other characters who have been collected along the way are added.

Bruno seems to be a likeable person and has a wide range of friends and acquaintances who make appearances throughout the the story.
