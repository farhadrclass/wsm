For one, it written by a fictional character. Who would have thought to merge the Tao with Patrick Swayze's film quotes? To actually succeed shows creative genius.

Your Swayze's in my Tao. Within the ancient passages of the Tao Te Ching there is great wisdom on how to live your daily life; how to live the \"Way\". The same life lessons can be found in the sage-like colloquies born out of Patrick Swayze's storied film career. This book pairs the philosophies of the Tao with Various quotes from Patrick Swayze's movies, offering inspiration and humor. Proceeds from this book will be donated to help fund Cancer Research.
