I was agreeably surprised to discover that her style is a pleasant mix of Jane Austen and the Bront\u00eb sisters. This novel combines to excellence well-drawn and fascinating characters, mysterious settings, family secrets and gothic atmosphere. I was swept away in the story within the first few pages and had a really hard time putting it down, because I simply had to know what would happen next. Emma Smallwood and her father arrive in Cornwall where Mr. Smallwood has accepted a position as tutor to the two youngest sons of the Weston family of Ebbington Manor. Strangely, although Sir Giles Weston has invited them, there is no one to welcome them upon their arrival, and they are made to feel unwelcome at Ebbington by Lady Weston's chilly reception. Already, the reader is aware of a tensed atmosphere of mystery and intrigue, and that atmosphere only gets better and heavier as the story goes on.Soon, Emma is aware that someone is entering her room at night; she finds a toy soldier on the ground, receives strange love notes and her diary goes missing! Who could be entering her room and why? And why does it seem as though everyone had a secret at Ebbington Manor?Sir Giles seemed to have forgotten that he'd invited the Smallwoods to his estate and Lady Weston is obviously displeased to have them there. Emma also meets Lizzie Henshaw, Lady Weston's ward, and though the girl seems friendly enough, she is clearly hiding something. Then, there are the four Weston brothers; Julian and Rowan, who will be tutored by Mr. Smallwood, and Phillip and Henry, whom Emma already knows, having met them while they attended her father's academy in Longstaple. Phillip had been a kind friend to her in the old days, always attentive and smiling, while Henry had teased her mercilessly and had shown himself arrogant and overbearing. She hesitates in blaming him for the pranks however, as she can see that he is a boy no longer and surely has enough maturity by now to forgo such silly teasing. She remains on her guard, but will soon learn that there is more to him that meets the eye...Emma was a truly wonderful heroine, and I could relate to her in many ways; her love of books and order, having a designated spot for everything, writing in a journal, having a special teacup, making lists of all kind, calm and tranquil demeanour and secret romantic aspirations. Emma is clever, courageous and noble, and she was the perfect heroine for such a complicated tale of dark secrets, love tangles, forbidden north wing, strange whisperings, romantic tension and dangerous Church tower.The hero of this novel was a true swoony knight in shining armour and I loved him from the beginning. Also clever, courageous and noble, he was the perfect match for Emma, and also the perfect man to set everything to rights at Ebbington manor. There were many touching and heart-warming moments throughout the story, which offered a nice contrast to the otherwise tensed and dark atmosphere.Filled with suspense, romance, adventure and danger, The Tutor's Daughter was an amazing read, perfect for reading on a dark rainy afternoon, wrapped in a warm blanket and drinking tea from a special teacup. Strongly recommend to anyone who is looking for an engaging tale of romantic suspense in a light Gothic Regency atmosphere."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "3.5 stars, rounding up. This is a pretty good historical romance, with a little bit of semi-gothic mystery and suspense mixed in, sort of like a Christian version of an old Victoria Holt novel. Emma, the daughter of a widower, accompanies her father to Cornwall, where he will be the in-house tutor for the younger half-brothers of Henry and Phillip Weston, whom she knew as younger boys when they used to attend her father's academy for boys. Phillip was the outgoing, friendly one who flirted with her; his older brother Henry was the one who was awkward and standoffish ... except when he teased her. They're wealthy gentry while Emma just helps her father teach school, so of course there will be no romancing going on. Of course.The plot is thickened with some run-ins with local villagers, who rely on shipwrecks (which often happened in the dangerous Cornwall coastal area) for salvaged goods that they can keep or resell, vs. Henry, who's trying to rescue shipwrecked seamen and help them protect their cargoes. There are also mysterious noises in the house, a secret the family is obviously trying to keep from Emma and her father, and someone sneaking into Emma's room at night and stealing things from her room. There are also some friendly, semi-love letters left under her door from some unnamed admirer -- which actually struck me as rather out of place and out of character at the time for the person doing this, but whatever.There are expressly stated Christian themes in this book: the hero is encouraging the heroine to find God again. It's not too overwhelming and doesn't overpower the plot, and it's nice that the hero is such an honorable guy, not a jerk in the least (just trying to make up for a few jerk moments from when he was a teenager, hah). The heroine is one of the quiet, practical sort, not gorgeous but quietly attractive. She thinks she's tall and gawky, but the guys seem to like the way she looks.I'm not a huge Julie Klassen fan, but every once in a while I pick up one of her books. I have to say that this is one of the better Klassen books I've read. It's not terribly deep, and it gets a little slow in spots (I succumbed to the temptation to peek ahead), but it's a satisfying historical romance if you like -- or at least don't mind -- some religious content. So far this one and The Maid of Fairbourne Hall have been the Klassen books I've liked best of the five I've read, with Fairborne Hall having the edge as the slightly better book."}, {"userName": "Loretta", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4057814-loretta", "userReview": "If I were rating this book solely on the first half of the book I probably would give it 3. To a certain point I really like Klassen's writing. That point would be when about half way through the book it begins to draaaaaaag on. And on. And I start holding it up and comparing pages to see how much longer it is going to last and think 'SURELY I have to be further than this'. Because although Klassen is an interesting, perhaps even entertaining, author, she just doesn't have the chops to sustain interest for 400 pages, particularly not when one can easily figure out within the first 50 just where the story is going and who, in the end, 'gets the girl'. If you like Christian fluff fiction with an historical bent, you'll probably enjoy this. She's decent at the genre. Don't look for depth of writing or really anything remarkably interesting to happen with the plot. Definitely no plot twists, not if you've read anything else by her, or in this genre. And the one remotely unpredictable mystery...just who that girl is whose name I've already forgotten? Yeah, that's going to be dispensed with in about 2 sentences. Maybe a full paragraph. Sigh. We COULD have had some intrigue there."}, {"userName": "Tito", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21907583-tito", "userReview": "UPDATEI just realized that I somehow forgot to add this book to my read shelf. Concerning the book, all I can say is that it I actually liked it which is an absolute shock for me since I had already determined that I would dislike it, but I really enjoyed the story. In fact, this is the only Julie Klassen book that I like. Every other one I've read was boring or the characters seemed plain to me. With this book however, I was totally invested in the plot and needed to know what was going to happen. Plus the romance was really sweet and I enjoyed seeing flashbacks of the main characters as children. They were adorable. In addition, the mystery in the novel actually kept me guessing, and was written skillfully so I was hooked. However the best thing about the story was that there was no love triangle. What a relief.4 surprising stars for me.2016I really wanna read this, but I smell a love triangle, and I can't stand those. I always find myself rolling my eyes at them. Maybe I'll try it, but if the love-triangle is a big part of the book, I'll put it down."}, {"userName": "Caz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4368838-caz", "userReview": "4.5 starsPublication date 1 Jan 2013, 28 Feb in the UK according to Amazon UKThe Tutor\u2019s Daughter is an well-written and engaging romantic mystery set in Cornwall in the early years of the 19th Century, at a time when the Cornish coast was a haven for smugglers and \u201cwreckers\u201d (locals who would plunder the goods of foundering and wrecked ships, often ignoring the plight of the crew in favour of saving the cargo).Emma Smallwood lives with her widowed father at his small boys\u2019 school in Devonshire, but since the death of her mother two years previously, Mr Smallwood has not taken a great deal of interest in his school which has led to a decline in the number of pupils attending. Following the departure of their most recent pupil, Emma decides to try to drum up some business \u2013 this is their livelihood, after all \u2013 and to that end writes to Sir Giles Weston, father of Henry and Philip Weston, who attended the school some years ago, to ascertain if he has any interest in sending his two younger sons (twins Julian and Rowan) to be educated at the school.Surprisingly, his response is to invite Mr Smallwood and Emma to his home, to tutor the boys there, a proposal which Mr Smallwood is keen to accept.Emma has fond memories of Philip Weston, but not so of his older brother who used to tease her unkindly and continually subject her to pranks; so while she is keen to see Philip and even harbours some romantic feelings for him, she is more apprehensive about meeting Henry again.I really enjoyed the story. There is a Jane Eyre-ish quality to the early part of the book in that there appears to be a mysterious stranger in the house who is prone to wandering around late at night. That part of the mystery is, however, solved about half-way through the book (and the attentive reader will probably have made a reasonable guess as to the solution by then anyway!) , but there are many more sinister goings-on at Ebbington Manor which kept me anxiously turning the pages. The Weston family is clearly hiding more than just a \u201cmadwoman in the attic\u201d, however. The second Lady Weston rules the roost; Sir Giles is often apathetic and usually goes along with his wife\u2019s wishes in order to have a quiet life. Their teenaged sons Rowan and Julian are surly and rude, and her ladyship\u2019s ward, Lizzie Henshaw is at one moment a vapid girl desirous of nothing more than pretty dresses and town gossip, and the next is spiteful and catty, a mass of contradiction. Emma hasn\u2019t had a lot of female companionship in her life and initially hopes that they can be friends, but it soon becomes apparent that Lizzie is rather unstable and only interested in herself. I don\u2019t like to say too much about the plots of the books I review so as not to spoil them for potential readers, and I think it\u2019s even more imperative that I don\u2019t give too much away when reviewing a mystery story. Suffice to say that I found the mysteries and their resolutions to be satisfying and that although I had my suspicions as to how certain characters were tied together, there were still some surprises along the way.Running alongside the mystery is the story of the deepening friendship between Emma and Henry. Initially, she distrusts him intensely, believing him to be the same boy who tormented her at the school. This may seem very na\u00efve \u2013 and in fact there was the odd time I rolled my eyes and thought that she needed to realise that Henry has grown up in more ways than one; but it\u2019s very clear that Henry\u2019s pranks and teasing cut her quite deeply and so I suppose it\u2019s natural for her to retain her suspicions of him until he begins to prove to her that he can be trusted.But prove it he does. Henry and Emma strike up a tentative friendship which quickly turns into mutual affection and understanding. Emma is surprised to find herself attracted to him and the romance between them develops at a good pace \u2013 it doesn\u2019t feel rushed, although I did think that the reasons that (briefly) separated them towards the end of the book were somewhat flimsy.If I have one quibble about the book, it is with Henry\u2019s questioning of Emma\u2019s faith \u2013 or lack of it. Clearly, this is a book with a Christian message, and I have no problem with that, provided that message is handled subtly - which for the most part it is. I just felt that the passages in which Henry tried to restore Emma\u2019s faith in prayer were somewhat jarring when set alongside the presentation of the rest of the story. I would almost say that those sections felt like conscious \u201cinsertions\u201d rather than an organic part of the novel as a whole. That said, however, I thought that the part where Henry tried to talk to his brother about God and his concept of Him worked much better contextually.Taken as a whole, I found this to be a very enjoyable read. The characterisation is consistent, the various plot threads are skilfully woven together and the romance is charmingly done.Recommended.With thanks to the publisher and NetGalley for the review copy."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19799133-maria", "userReview": "Emma Smallwood\u2019s life suddenly changes when she decides to move to Cornwall to help her widowed father teach two sons of Sir Giles Weston and cheer his low spirits up.

The only member of the family she is happy to see again is Phillip, the second son of the baronet who attended her father\u2019s Academy years before as the elder son Henry did. Phillip was always very nice to her and very friendly. On the other hand, Henry was a mischievous boy who was always ready to tease her and argue with her. When things get more dangerous and someone tries to send her back home, will Emma learn who is worthy her trust? Will she be able to understand what and most of all who her heart truly wants?I do not know if I can perfectly explain how much I loved this novel. I loved everything. I was completely enchanted and hooked by Emma\u2019s adventures and the people she dealt with, especially one of the Weston brothers (but I will not tell which one because I do not want to spoil anything). I wanted to finish it soon to see how it ended but I did not want to finish it because I was very sorry I could not read it anymore. I know, I am a little crazy!Anyway, I enjoyed reading about the places Emma visited and the descriptions of the landscapes she explored. I was thrilled about all the mysteries, secrets, misunderstandings she experienced with some people in the mansion. Every time I imagined what would happen there was an unexpected twist that pleased me! I felt close to Emma because she is a passionate, clever girl and book lover like me, also she prefers a good book over a long afternoon spent shopping. I liked the strength of the words used to speak about God and religion and I was pleasantly surprised to read about first impressions that were totally wrong, about different characters. Truly, there is nothing I did not love. I even liked Lizzie Henshaw\u2019s (Lady Weston\u2019s ward) lack of privacy and Lady Weston\u2019s pride.

I loved the combination of romance, intrigue and mystery--it was perfect.Just when I thought I knew what was coming, there would be a plot twist that totally took me by surprise. Klassen definitely excels at giving the reader just what they need to know but not too much. The supporting characters were delightfully complex and perplexing. They are all hiding secrets, both malicious and benign, and figuring out who is hiding what kept me turning the pages until the very end. For me, this plot had better pacing than some of her other novels. I never felt like the story line slacked off or that the tension lessened. I didn't care for the prevalence of flashbacks that she used, but they were never very long, so it wasn't too much of a bother.Cornwall was the perfect setting for the story. It seemed to be such a brooding, slightly wild place, and it made for a lovely backdrop. I also must say that Klassen excels at endings. My biggest complaint about endings is when they are too abrupt and don't answer all of the questions. I like how this one came full circle without dragging on with unnecessary details. I liked this nearly as much as The Lady of Milkweed Manor, which is my favorite Klassen novel. This is definitely my favorite since reading that one. Just an all-around fun, romantic historical. Fans of this period and type of setting will not be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2965894-renee", "userReview": "I'm so glad that the first book I read in 2013 was a Julie Klassen book. Her books are always so well written with intriguing settings and characters reminiscent of the classic romances. As was the case with her previous novels this starts out slowly but continually builds so much so that you can't put it down! At first I was bit worried that this was going to be too much of a Jane Eyre copycat with a mysterious \"ghost\" at Weston manor causing all sorts of mischief but I was genuinely surprised by just who that said ghost really was. The Tutor's Daughter not only is a romance but a unique look at what life was like for those who were considered to be \"different\" in the 19th century. It's what touched me the most in this book and I couldn't help but fall in love with such endearing characters like the elder Weston brothers, both the hero and his brother. All aspects of this story were perfection and The Tutor's Daughter has earned it's spot as my new favorite Julie Klassen read and quite possibly a favorite book of 2013!*I received a complimentary copy of this book for review from the publisher. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255.*"}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11040622-bethany", "userReview": "Out of all six of Julie Klassen's books, I've read four, and by far, The Tutor's Daughter was for SURE my very favorite and the most clean of the ones I've read. I was very impressed with it and thoroughly enjoyed every page! Some of Julie's other books were for older girls as they had some mature content that I really didn't care for, but this book pleasantly surprised me in the fact that it was very clean. I especially appreciated how the romance level was very low, and how the author chose to save the romance for the end, so that you can enjoy the story without it being overly romantic the whole time. I've recently come to have a great appreciation for books that have a balanced amount of romance, as so often this is the main focus of a book and kind of drowns out the actual story, not to mention put wrong thoughts in your mind from time-to-time, but this one had the perfect amount and was well-balanced.Another thing I enjoyed was the suspense! It was such a page-turning book, and very exciting! I really liked how Julie accomplished getting a very healthy dose of suspense in the story without involving any deaths, murder, crimes, etc, that are so often found in suspense novels. Their were also many twists and turns that I never saw coming, and kept the story from getting dull. Right when I thought all the questions were answered, there would be something else that would come up that I never saw coming! As for the characters, I loved them all from the start, well... maybe not all of them....Henry for one, wasn't exactly my favorite male character to begin with.... *Shows knowing grin to those who had read The Tutor's Daughter and remember Henry's famous speech concerning a dance he would perform at Emma's wedding.....* The main character, Emma, however I did love from the beginning. She is a very likable character and I loved how she kept a journal and was very orderly, oh and she LOVES books - that we have in common. ;) After reading that part, I was like, okay, I really like this character now. New best friend. She's my favorite. :) But anyways, this book had a very wonderful moral speaking against judging \"a book by it's cover\" so to speak, as we see clearly how someone can change drastically for the better; as well as the other side of someone's character getting worse with age. I'd say which of the two brother's was my favorite, but that would basically give the book away so I won't tell you, but if you've read the book, I assure you that you will know, as we will most probably agree.Another thing I was very enthused about was all the history packed into this book! In the author's note in the back after the story, I was surprised to learn that some of the characters, as well as the places, were all true and actual people and places-most of them so accurate down even to the names! I love books with a well-written story, but to get history in there as well...I'm all for it, and wasn't disappointed with this one! Another favorite thing in this book was the level on Christian values involved. At the beginning of the story, Emma wasn't on speaking terms with God after her mother's death. However in the story a certain male character gets to share Christ with her and she renews her faith and lives her life more profitably in the end. I loved the scene were this took place, it's one of my favorite parts in the whole book!The only thing I didn't really like in this story was their were a few little scenes that got, well, to be a bit more than I'd have written. But it really depends on what you are used to. Their is one scene where Henry makes a certain comment sarcastically early on in the book, as well as a few other little things such as two of the main characters unexpectedly being in each others presence at night in their nightclothes due to an \"emergency\" involving blood. As well as a disturbing image that was painted on one of Emma's missing journal pages that was stolen. They weren't at all a deal breaker or anything so bad that you'd not to read the book because of them, but I didn't really care for them. Romance-wise this book was very clean, and the farthest it ever went was some kissing. Total I think their were three kisses towards the end. While they were a bit descriptive, they weren't at all inappropriate, but again, it all depends on what you are used to. Girls who would most enjoy this book the most would be those who love Christian historical fiction, with a bit of romance mixed in, with a regency era style."}, {"userName": "Naomi Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40096835-naomi-sarah", "userReview": "I have mixed feelings about this book.

Once again, I found myself staying up late at night, in need of answers, turning page after page, sinking in the mystery and romance, dashed with gothic suspense, this book has to offer. This author is definitely one of the best I\u2019ve ever read, and her passion and commitment for storytelling are visible in the pages of each of her books.The Tutor\u2019s Daughter is a wonderful gothic romance set in the coast of Cornwall, that starts when Emma Smallwood and her father leave their academy for boys and go to live and teach the younger children of Ebbington Manor, home of the Weston family, whose older sons, Henry and Phillip, both studied with Mr. Smallwood as kids. Emma remembers both from the past, as they played lots of pranks on her as children, and is more eager to see Phillip than Henry, since she recalls him being the kindest, most attentive from the two brothers. But trouble starts head on. From the moment they arrive at Cornwall, things start going oddly wrong. No one shows up when they were supposed to be picked up by a carriage, their rooms aren\u2019t ready when they get to the Manor, the masters of the house have completely forgotten they would arrive that day\u2026 And from there, things start to go wrong.I confess that a part of the mystery didn\u2019t engaged me, simply because I could predict what was going on. The mysterious nocturnal visits to Emma\u2019s room, the handprint on her mirror, the piano playing on its own in the empty music room\u2026 That was no ghost. From the moment I read Lady Weston forbidding them to visit the house\u2019s north wing, I knew that the mad man/woman locked up and isolated plot was coming. It isn\u2019t badly written, but it can be seen coming from miles away, and instantly reminded me of another, classic novel with a mad woman locked up in a mysterious, dark, echoing attic (you all know which I\u2019m talking about). It\u2019s not a wrong decision from authors to choose this path, but the thing is that, in my opinion, that other book I mentioned is the first thing that pops into our heads upon reading it. Again, it\u2019s well put, but it\u2019s been read a lot of times before, it\u2019s an overused plot point. Although, as we get to know, this particular madman isn\u2019t exactly crazy; I guessed he was another Weston brother after the brief conversation between Henry and Lady Weston that Emma manages to overhear, but the surprise part for me was to read that Adam wasn\u2019t aggressive, and never meant any harm; he was just curious, as a child, and although the book doesn\u2019t say so, his case sounds more like a case of autism than insanity. It is horrible that having such a child was considered shameful for these grand families, that decided to give them away to be elsewhere, but I loved how Henry still remembered he was his brother, wanted him to have a loving, comfortable home, and loved him for who he was, in despite of everything.As usual, this book is full of deep constructed characters, and there\u2019s some you love, and some you hate. Emma Smallwood is utterly adorable, and I loved her. She\u2019s smart and organized, and isn\u2019t afraid of anything, she\u2019s bold enough to do whatever is needed, no matter what. I loved the fact that nothing could stop her once her mind was made, and didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval to go ahead with her plans and ideas (when she slapped Lizzie, she did something I had been longing to do myself). Somehow, I felt I could be friends with Emma. Julie Klassen\u2019s characters are always deep and passionate, with both virtues and flaws, and I could truly see some of me in Emma, in her doubts and fears, especially as a Christian, and in that feeling of not-belonging, of not being there, but neither here. As tutors at Ebbington Manor, Emma and her father aren\u2019t servants, but neither part of the family. They are somewhere in the middle, and for the well-organized, always-in-control Emma, that\u2019s a difficult position in which, I believe, most of us have been, are, or will be. And creating a relatable character is key in any piece of fiction, because it can make the reader connect with the character on a deeper level. And Henry! I loved him from page one. He acknowledges he did wrong in the past, and wants to become a better person and Christian. He has to keep his head cool and think as his family\u2019s heir, and that means watching for the state and its grounds, managing finances, and of course, marrying the right woman, which his stepmother already chose to bear the Weston last name (she doesn\u2019t care which brother marries her, as long as one of them does). He is a hero for me, in the way that he doesn\u2019t care what happens to him if that means he can avoid a greater evil. He\u2019s seen enough of men drowning in the sea during storms in the coast, and when his time comes, he does his best to save as many lives as he can. It was very impressive, and mostly because the rescue is based on a real rescue occurred in the area, when a man on horseback was able to rescue sailors from the sea after a shipwreck. Again, Julie Klassen proves how well she knows how to use her research, and how much she cares for historical accuracy.Even when I was afraid, for a moment, that this book would contain a love triangle (I hate them), I was relieved to find out that it didn\u2019t. I never thought, not even for a moment, that Emma would end up with Phillip. She had fond memories of him, but clearly, she wasn\u2019t going to fall in love with him. She was too smart for someone like Phillip, who always felt like some foolish, soft guy, not at all at the level of what Henry could be. Unlike his brother, Phillip is guided by his feelings and acts upon them, he leaves Oxford at midterm to see some girl of humble origins he\u2019s in love with\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s too much space for doubting and guessing. Phillip is clearly depicted as somewhat inferior to Henry, and there was no reason for Emma to fall for him, and I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t, for her relationship with Henry had me rooting for them the entire book, eagerly waiting for them to kiss, and when they did\u2026! *sigh* I read that kiss over and over again, it was beautiful, emotionally open, and raw honest, they stopped thinking and for once listened to their hearts. It\u2019s not like I feared for their lives, but I imagined myself in the whole situation, and it gave me goosebumps (for the record, the flooding chapel, not kissing Henry, but it could be applied to both). Although Emma doesn\u2019t acknowledge her feelings for a big part of the book, she sees Henry\u2019s superiority of character and personality, and how he struggles to improve every day, but knows, the whole time, that he can\u2019t marry her, given her station as the tutor\u2019s daughter. I\u2019ve read many other books in which the characters want to be together, but they struggle to hide their feelings and remain apart from one another simply because they shouldn\u2019t, whatever the reason for that (mostly social standing, but also money conditions, stubbornness, reluctance to accept feelings\u2026 you know, the usual), and I liked very much the fact that Emma and Henry know the barriers between them, but they avoid this endless rambling that normally takes lots of pages about all the reasons why the shouldn\u2019t be together. And that\u2019s great, because it speaks of an author behind the book that cares about not exhausting her readers with repeated information, assuming they are smart and don\u2019t need a constant repetition of the same thing over and over again, which happens a lot with other authors. After the disaster in the Chapel, I was engrossed with the whole explanations around the mysteries build as the novel moved forward. The plot around Lady Weston was engrossing and I felt outraged, because it was justified. Many times, villains don\u2019t have a believable goal, they exist for the sole purpose of opposing the hero, but you can\u2019t figure out why exactly\u2026 But in this case, it has a purpose, and I even understand it. I know why she acted that way, thinking as a mother, going beyond the law for her sons to have something for their future lives. I loved that Rowan decided, in the end, to do the honorable thing, proudly calling Henry his brother and apologizing to Emma for all those pranks, bordering cruelty. But Julian! That prepotency! Upon the ending of the book, seeing him talking to his father and brothers like that, I was thinking \u201cplease, sir Giles, slap him as the disrespectful brat he is, he deserves it!\u201d. But he didn\u2019t, instead sending him to the navy. Not everyone gets a happy ending in this book.There\u2019s something I would like to mention, that doesn\u2019t get completely clarified. Was Phillip in love with Lizzie? That\u2019s probably the only loose end, because everything is an assumption, there\u2019s no clear affirmation that they actually wanted to get married (and they don\u2019t). On the other hand, Aunt Jane\u2019s happy ending left a big smile plastered on my face, because even when she had little part on the story, she was an adorable character and I was very happy that she got to make her delayed dreams come true.Not much else to add, except that I loved this book, and I wish to do justice to all the awesome little details it has. All authors need the passion Julie Klassen expresses with each page, and of course, I\u2019ll eagerly grab any book with her name on it, because it\u2019s guaranteed to be excellent!*If you like what you read, you can find me in my blog for more reviews and other articles: http://abookandateacup.blogspot.com.ar/*"}, {"userName": "Tammie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3506989-tammie", "userReview": "Emma Smallwood agrees to travel with her father to the distant Cornwall coast when his academy fails.

The Tutor's Daughter is a Christian Regency romance with a bit of Jane Eyre (the large mysterious house with a family secret and odd noises in the middle of the night), a little of Jamaica Inn (the wreckers who profit off of ships sinking off the coast) and a dash of Sabrina (The 1954 Audry Hepburn movie) thrown in. I liked this combination a lot. I also really enjoyed the slow build of the romance.I did feel like the book was kind of long and I usually prefer the religious aspects of these type books to be more subtly woven into the story.

She has a good heart and I liked that she stands up for what is right, I kind of wish she would just loosen up a bit though. She sometimes came across as an old matron then a young lady. I did like our hero; he has always had a crush on Emma and is always looking out for her. I liked their relationship, I liked that it is built on friendship and you can really believe that they\u2019ll get a happily ever after.

Determined to help her father get back on his feet, Emma takes matters into her own hands and writes to the parents of one of her favourite former pupils, hoping that they\u2019ll offer to send their two youngest sons to her father\u2019s school. She\u2019s surprised when the recipient of the letter, Sir Giles Weston, responds with an offer for her and her father to move to Ebbington Manor in Cornwall to tutor his youngest sons. Emma doesn\u2019t expect her father to accept the offer, but he decides that a change of scenery might be good for them. Emma is secretly hoping for the chance to meet Philip Weston again, having long held on to fond memories of their time together at the academy. She\u2019s not so keen to run into his older brother, Henry, given the pranks he used to play on her as a child. But Henry has matured far beyond Emma\u2019s wildest dreams, and she\u2019s surprised to find herself far more interested in the older Weston brother, especially given her prior feelings towards Philip. Life at Ebbington Manor definitely isn\u2019t as straight-forward as Emma anticipated. The younger Weston brothers talk of a ghost, and Emma would normally dismiss such talk, if it weren\u2019t for the mysterious noises she hears at night and the distinct feeling that someone visits her room while she\u2019s sleeping. The presence of Lady Weston\u2019s ward, Lizzie, is unexplained and the girl appears to be hiding something. Even more mysterious are Henry\u2019s attempts to build a warning tower to bring aid to the ships that are often wrecked during storms along the Cornwall coast, and the reaction this brings from local wreckers, some of whom seem too involved in the Weston family\u2019s affairs. Can all of these circumstances create a suitable environment for Emma and her father to recover from her mother\u2019s death, and possibly form new relationships? Or is their visit to Cornwall far less simple than they anticipated?Not being quite as obsessed with Jane Austen as some women, I never felt the desire to pick up a Regency romance until my book group chose to read Julie Klassen\u2019s The Maid of Fairbourne Hall back in March. After devouring the novel in a matter of days, I immediately realised my mistake in avoiding her novels for so long, and have been eagerly awaiting the publication of The Tutor\u2019s Daughter ever since. Although I didn\u2019t love this novel quite as much as Julie\u2019s previous book, I still immensely enjoyed it, and may have stayed up long past midnight to finish reading it.What I appreciated most about The Tutor\u2019s Daughter was Julie\u2019s ability to make all of the characters come alive, regardless of how small a part they played in the novel. I noticed this when I read The Maid of Fairbourne Hall, and was pleased to discover that she continued her manner of developing characters in the lives of the Weston family and their friends. Although a few characters may initially seem a little villainous, their motivations were revealed as the novel developed. I particularly appreciated the way that Henry\u2019s feelings about his stepmother were put across and this made me sympathise with him all the more. Even the younger Weston brothers are given distinct personalities, which makes the revelation towards the end of the novel all the more surprising. I don\u2019t want to go too far into the details of the plot, but I will say that the plot twists weren\u2019t easily anticipated. Sometimes the suspense in a romance novel isn\u2019t as dramatic as it could be, because you know the hero and heroine are going to get out of their perilous situation and be married by the end of the novel, so you don\u2019t have to worry too much about them. This wasn\u2019t so much the case with The Tutor\u2019s Daughter, and even though I knew that the hero and heroine would somehow find a way to be together, there were still several points in the novel where my heart was pounding and I was worried that they wouldn\u2019t live to see the next morning. It makes me sound rather silly, as if I\u2019d forgotten how romance novels work, but I\u2019ll defer responsibility to Julie\u2019s wonderful writing. I\u2019d also like to credit Julie for making Cornwall come alive and inspiring me to put it on my \u201cMust Visit\u201d list. Since I\u2019m one of the few readers of this novel who actually lives within driving distance of Cornwall, I probably should visit it someday. Interesting unintentionally, this is the second novel I\u2019ve read in the last few weeks that was set in Cornwall, and both books made the location seem far more fascinating than any school history lesson or friend\u2019s holiday stories have in the past. As always, Julie includes her snippets from history books or local newspapers at the start of the chapter, detailing Cornwall\u2019s history and facts about shipwrecks and tutoring in the period. These details are also scattered throughout the novel as Emma investigates Cornwall\u2019s history. The history might not be as detailed as other historical novels, but there\u2019s enough to get a feel of being in the fictional Ebbington Manor in Cornwall in the early nineteenth century.The one factor that holds me back from giving this novel a higher rating is actually Emma herself. As fascinating at the details about Cornwall and shipwrecks were, along with the development of the minor characters in the novel and their motivations, I didn\u2019t actually feel like I got to know Emma all that well. She wasn\u2019t a terribly distinct character, compared to some romantic heroines, so it was very easy to imagine yourself in her place and feel as if you were visiting Ebbington Manor and trying to figure out the family\u2019s secrets. I think this is good, to a certain extent. But it wasn\u2019t until close to the end of the novel when Emma began to make some changes in her life that I realised that this was the first real sign of character development that I\u2019d witnessed. Emma does have some flaws, but I felt like they were abandoned a little in the development of the main plot. It was very easy to place myself in Emma\u2019s shoes and see Ebbington Manor through her eyes, but I didn\u2019t relate to many of her conflicts or flaws. At times, I actually felt like it was easier to relate to and sympathise with Henry, given his many relational and moral conflicts.Likewise, as well as I felt that Emma\u2019s spiritual conflict was handled, it wasn\u2019t the most inspiring conflict. I seem to have come across a spate of novels recently where the main character\u2019s spiritual journey simply focuses on them reclaiming their lost faith. I did feel that Emma\u2019s journey was the most realistic presentation out of those I\u2019ve come across lately, so I\u2019ll credit Julie with that, but I do wish that authors would be a little bit more creative when it comes to the spiritual side of their novels.Although I wasn\u2019t quite as enthralled with The Tutor\u2019s Daughter as I was with The Maid of Fairbourne Hall, I will freely admit that my issues with the novel are fairly minor. Julie\u2019s long-standing fans are sure to be pleased with this latest offering, and any Christian historical romance fans who have not yet picked up a Julie Klassen novel are definitely missing out.

Emma Smallwood and her father leave Longstaple and their boarding school and failing academy for Ebbington Manor on the Cornwall Coast. It is there that Mr Smallwood is hired to tutor the two youngest Weston boys, Julian and Rowan. Ebbington Manor is laced with secrets and has a little bit of mystery with many complexities developing throughout. The Tutor's Daughter is filled with many well crafted characters - some likable and some not so likable. Emma is not quite a guest, not quite a servant, and certainly not family at Ebbington. Who is her ardent admirer and sending the presumptuous notes to Emma? Are they a prank or are they sincere?Phillip and Henry, the two eldest Weston brothers, are quite interesting. Phillip, who seems to be the kind, mild and friendly one, and Henry, who is rather laconic - at least early on.Lady Weston, the stepmother, comes across as an unkind woman who is very fond of money and not pleased to have a romance develop between one of her stepsons and the Tutor's daughter, Emma. And what secret was she hiding?Sir Giles, the father of the Weston family, tries his best to appease Lady Weston, but a nearly impossible task. He very often retreats to his library and drinks brandy as problems arise.Lizzie Henshaw, Lady Weston's ward, was my least favorite character - a bit hard to like with her sharp tongue. And what was her troubling secret?And finally, the two younger twin brothers, Julian and Rowan who were full of pranks and also a little hard to like at times. Julie Klassen never disappoints me with her beautifully written books, a style similar to Jane Austen. I know I'm in the minority, but I have to say that this is not one of my Klassen favorites. My favorite is still Lady of Milkweed Manor. A negative comment I have is that the storyline moved too slowly in the first third of the book.

Reminiscent of Jane Eyre, there appears to be a mysterious stranger (a mad woman in the attic?) who is prone to wandering around late at night. That mystery is solved about halfway through the book but there are many more sinister goings-on which kept me anxiously turning the pages. The character development is excellent--believable and consistent. The various plot threads, with plenty of unexpected twists, are skilfully woven together and the romance is charmingly done. Klassen is known as a \"Christian author\" who tastefully weaves her message into her fiction without beating you over the head with it. Here is an example:\u201cDo you not pray, Miss Smallwood?'She avoided his gaze. 'No.''God is speaking to you every day,' he said softly. 'You might return the favor.'She raised her chin. 'I don't hear Him.''Do you listen?'She looked at him, clearly offended, then turned away again.

Haven't not yet read any books in the genre, I was pleased when Netgalley offered up a copy of THE TUTOR'S DAUGHTER, by Christy Award-winning Julie Klassen. The bookish heroine sounded promising...Yet it wasn't the novel's religious aspects (which are really quite understated, coming up overtly only during a near-drowning scene between hero and heroine), but rather its painfully sluggish pace and its all-too-obvious plot turns that made this so difficult to get through. The text constructs its ideal reader as someone so innocent of romance conventions that she can't see the secrets of character and plot that a more experienced reader can see coming a mile away. Is the reader, then, supposed to be as innocent as Emma, the book's protagonist, I wonder? Are the heroines in all Inspirationals?The romance between Emma and the boy who once tormented her at her father's school, now a grown man, is sweet, the one redeeming aspect of an otherwise tedious read.ARC supplied courtesy of Netgalley."}, {"userName": "AnaCembo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72511187-anacembo", "userReview": "No conoc\u00eda a Julie Klassen pero, como amante de este g\u00e9nero, debo admitir que se nota que ambas somos grandes fans de Austen y Br\u00f6nte.Lo que m\u00e1s agradec\u00ed al leer la hija del tutor fue encontrarme con una protagonista bien cultivada y que considera a sus libros como el bien m\u00e1s preciado de su casa...

When the suspicious acts escalate, can the clever tutor\u2019s daughter figure out which brother to blame\u2026and which brother to trust with her heart?My Review:Emma Smallwood lost her mother two years ago and her father, John, runs \u2018The Smallwood Academy\u2019, a school for boys. Emma is the tutor who helps her father run the school, but they no longer have any students and can\u2019t survive without any income. Her father is very depressed over the death of his beloved wife and has no ambition whatsoever to try and find new students to enrol in his academy. A few years ago, two of the Weston family\u2019s sons, Phillip and Henry, had attended the Smallwood Academy and Emma knows they still have two younger sons who she hopes will enrol in their school. This prompts her to write a letter to Sir Giles Weston, a baronet, offering seats in their school for the two young boys. However, Sir Giles replies and invites Emma and John to their mansion to privately tutor their two young sons at home. Once they arrive on the Cornwall Coast, the home of the Weston\u2019s, all is not as it appears. There are a lot of unexplainable things happening during the night and someone is playing tricks on Emma. Each member of the Weston family seems very weird in their own way and the matriarch (step-mother) of the family is a stoic, snobbish woman who appears very untrustworthy from the beginning and the patriarch (Sir Giles) just seems to go along with whatever rules and demands his wife makes and not really paying any particular attention to what she is doing. Something is very strange about this entire family and their house and who and why is someone trying to scare Emma? This family is hiding a secret of some sort and Emma intends to discover just what that secret is. Why is there a room that no one is allowed entry too? Why would someone steal Emma\u2019s personal journal then finally return it with a page torn out? That missing page is eventually slid back under her bedroom door with a terrifying and threatening drawing on it. However, even with all this going on, Emma is falling in love with one of the Weston brothers. Will this person responsible for the drawing be caught before there are possible deadly consequences for Emma? Will Emma discover the family secret and will the Weston brother realize that Emma is in love with him? Julie Klassen has written a superb story that will grab you in the beginning and not shake you lose until the very end. I found it very hard to put this book down. I\u2019ve read other novels by Ms. Klassen but The Tutor\u2019s Daughter is something special!\"Book has been provided courtesy of Baker Publishing Group and Graf-Martin Communications, Inc.
