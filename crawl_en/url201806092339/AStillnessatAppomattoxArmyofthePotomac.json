And then you have the fight-grounds and sites of massacre from three centuries of Indian Wars, which seem to fall on either side of a fine line separating the comical (Tippecanoe, Little Big Horn) from the weirdly resonant (Fallen Timbers, Wounded Knee). I could read about this war indefinitely\u2014especially the final twelvemonth scourge. Every new narrative makes me a rapt listener at the Homeric campfire. Tell me again how it went. (Next to chant: Melville and Whitman, the former\u2019s dark little poems on Shiloh and ghostly guerrillas, the latter\u2019s army hospital recollections in Specimen Days and painterly, Winslow Homer-ish vignettes\u2014\u201cCavalry Crossing a Ford\u201d\u2014in Drum Taps.) \u201cUp-to-date\u201d is idle praise for a book on this war, because it\u2019s the original, partial accounts that make one\u2019s flesh creep, and they are rediscovered and rearranged to varying effect by later writers. Every American generation beginning with the one that fought has done some kind of literary justice to this transformative conflict\u2014our Great War and catalyst of modernity, as Gertrude Stein saw it. Catton, writing in the early 1950s about black troops at the Crater, is less sociologically comprehensive but just as affecting as Slotkin, a dedicated scholar of race relations, writing in 2009. As a storyteller, Catton makes particularly his own the weariness of the men. They hiked rough country blindly at night, during the day launched and repelled savage assaults, all for an entire Somme-like month\u2014May to early June 1864\u2014at the end of which everyone who hadn\u2019t been shot was mad or nearly so with shell-shocked fatigue. Catton is also very eloquent on the disappearance of celebrated units under the wheels of war. This or that decimated regiment, brigade, division or even whole corps (two were wrecked at Gettysburg) would be struck from the army\u2019s rolls, its few disbanded survivors scattered to other formations whose commanders sometimes indulged the aggrieved pride of the exiles by allowing them to continue carrying their bullet-riddled banners, on which the names of old battles\u2014various -burgs and -villes, and mysterious Indian-named rivers\u2014were sewn."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1751300-richard", "userReview": "This is the third installment in Bruce Catton's great Civil War trilogy. Similar to the first two volumes, \"A Stillness at Appomattox\" continues the style of writing history for modern readers, concentrating on the human motivations central to important events. These books are as readable and enjoyable today as they were originally in the 1950's. Beyond the broad appeal inherent in them, these three volumes, and especially \"A Stillness...\" were important components in the mid-twentieth century's rediscovery of the American Civil War, and the awakening of enthusiasm for the epic struggle, which continues. This volume runs from early 1864 until the end of the war in April, 1865. The populace supporting each side in the conflict was becoming extremely war-weary, but the events of the previous few years showed that General Robert E. Lee's Confederate army was willing to suffer any hardship and keep fighting as long as the slimmest hope for survival existed. President Abraham Lincoln finally found the individual who would be capable of leading his army to ultimate victory. He placed Ulysses S. Grant in charge of all of the armies of the United States. Although this position involved huge organizational responsibilities, the commanding general would not spend the rest of the war behind a desk in Washington, D.C. Grant's previous brilliant field leadership in the western army theater would be needed to directly manage the army on the ground. He established his headquarters with General George Meade. Meade was thanked by a grateful nation for his effective leadership at Gettysburg, and he retained the role of commanding general of the Army of the Potomac. However, he would be kept under direct, daily supervision by his superior, Grant, who would be in charge for devising and carrying out the army's strategies. The overall strategy at the beginning of 1864 would be similar to earlier Army of the Potomac plans, namely, to get the army into Virginia and defeat the Confederates in the field, enabling the capture of the Confederate capital, Richmond. The significant difference this time was that the federal army was not going to return home until the job was done. There would be no fighting the enemy to a bloody standstill, followed by a disengagement by both armies to prepare for the next battle, until the changing seasons allowed all of the forces to go into winter quarters and contemplate the next year's objectives. Grant, and his core leadership cadre, consisting of generals who fought with him in the West the last several years, infused the spirit of winning into the army. The federal army's existing leaders, including Meade, were forced to re-think their approach to fighting a war. The basics of this new way of thinking rapidly spread through the ranks and became the foundation for a surge of wide-spread higher morale and tenacity among the soldiers. Catton describes the ensuing clashes between the two armies as Grant tried to maneuver between Lee and Richmond, and Lee worked his characteristic magic of constantly falling back with his army in time to prevent the federal army from forcing an end of the war with its superior strength. The death tolls mounted in battles as bad, if not worse, than some of the scenes of horror already enacted in previous years. Thus, Catton tells us how events unfolded at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and Cold Harbor. Lee finally stopped Grant's advance at Petersburg, just outside Richmond, and the war settled into armies fighting from entrenched, fixed positions. Catton shows how, when the end finally came with Lee breaking out of his fortified position in the spring of 1865, and having his exhausted army's movements finally blocked at Appomattox Court House, the prevailing mood in the Army of the Potomac was relief instead of jubilation. So much would happen during the time period covered in this volume, and Catton tells it masterfully."}, {"userName": "Evan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1248986-evan", "userReview": "This is not a book. It is a holy thing.It's holy for what it says, how it says it and how well it understands it. It is not read, it is lived. It is experienced in short bursts and set aside, so that you can close your eyes and imagine and contemplate and feel, and pay all proper homage -- as you try to grasp its enormity. I've been to Civil War cemeteries where thousands of headstones radiate in all directions, endlessly, but even that does not make me feel the accumulated weight of death and struggle and pain like this book does.Bruce Catton felt the Civil War down to his very marrow. It percolated and boiled hot in his blood and animated his very being. It inflamed his imagination. His love for it was passionate. His rumination on it was deep and profound. His feeling for it created electricity that shot to his fingers and moved them to write beautiful words about a terrible and momentous time.And because of that, he wrote this; this inexpressibly beautiful and moving account of horror and hope. It is one of the very greatest books I have ever had the pleasure to read.This, my friends, is how it's done.Trotting out superlatives for this is like someone who's too late for the party arriving with appetizers. What can I possibly add that hasn't already has been said? The book is famous, and justly so, and it's actually a relief to see that it is this good, because my elevated hopes were not only not dashed but amply fulfilled and exceeded.Catton set a standard for popular histories that is rarely equalled (yes, I know, Mr. Shelby Foote; he is imminent). But there I am, with the superlatives I said I wouldn't attempt. I was moved, not just by the content, and not just by how beautifully it was stated, but by the fact that someone wrote this, period. I was moved by the fact that someone achieved this in a book. The achievement alone moves me.The book opens dreamily at a celebratory ball where soldiers and their most-favored ladies danced in a makeshift, large pine-scented hall, arrayed with flags and chandeliers. (There are pencil illustrations of this ball on the Library of Congress website that match Catton's description; and seeing them makes for a haunting supplement to the reading). It was the Washington's Birthday Ball of Feb. 22, 1864. Its soldierly participants had no idea their war would drag on for another year, and this evening of finery and dance and civility was an attempt to suspend time and sublimate, if just a little, the inevitability of the savage battles soon to come, for they had no way of knowing that General Grant was about to unleash a new kind of war rarely seen in the memories of history. It would be total war. There would be no quarter, no letup, no mercy, and scorched earth, and all to the last man if necessary. Catton makes us know that very few of the men dancing on this night would long last, and that the women with whom they danced would lose them.From there, Catton introduces leaders, battles, incidents, and issues that often seem so disparate that they shouldn't fit so smoothly together into a flowing narrative, and yet they do without pause. It is the mark of someone who knows his subject -- this war -- inside and out; who knows it so well that telling it with absolute mastery, authority, and with more than a little poetry is second nature to him. These are words written not just out of duty to scholarship but in the service of love. Catton loved his subject. And this is a love letter to it. A bittersweet love letter from someone who sees the terrible beauty in unimaginable pain and in stubbornly clutched hope.Some might say this is a \"history written by the victors\" text, and certainly the book's slant is Northern. The book is, after all, largely about the trials and tribulations of the much-aggrieved Army of the Potomac. But there is balance aplenty, because Catton respects all of his combatants, and his over-arching poetry is the driving sensibility here, not how many column inches are devoted to this or that side. This is about how the war was won, by dint of a thousand cuts to all.The Germanic-order gene in me says I am doing all wrong starting with the third of Catton's Army of the Potomac trilogy instead of starting with the first and proceeding therefrom. But I don't listen to that spoilsport anymore. Besides, I read Catton's The Civil War reduction overview primer of the war in advance so I knew my place in the order of things. I have context.I am glad I have finally come to the Civil War, and to Catton. I will be returning to him, with hat in hand, and properly humbled.(KevinR@Ky 2016)"}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1254714-steve", "userReview": "I re-read this a few years back, and it's simply one of the best history books I've ever read. Grant's brutal sledgehammer campaign, Lee's ferocious response, it's all here, but written in a way that comes across, at times, like some sort of dark war poetry. I think I saw on Goodreads where someone said that Catton was a historian with great heart. I couldn't agree more. And as a Virginian, I love the way Catton captures a familiar landscape, since I actually live only a few miles from the Chancellorsville and Spotsylvania battlefields."}, {"userName": "Riannon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929288-riannon", "userReview": "I guess I read this book out of order, I didn't realize it was the third book in a trilogy. That being said, it worked just fine as a stand-alone book. The last few months of the Civil War were really brought to life for me by this book (sorry for the cliche phrase). It's well-written and reads like a novel, but it also contains a lot of quite interesting historical information. I've always found the Civil War a fascinating subject, and knew a moderate amount about it before reading this book, but the heights of bravery and cowardice attained by regular troops, the ineptness or heroic nature displayed by their commanders, and the terror of being under fire, were all thrown into vivid relief by A Stillness at Appomattox.I'd recommend this book to anyone, whether particularly interested in the Civil War or not. I could only wish that it had been assigned as reading for my high school history class in lieu of the reading material on the Civil War we were actually provided with!"}, {"userName": "Larry Bassett", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett", "userReview": "This is the third book of the famous Bruce Canton trilogy about the Civil War. Published about 65 years ago it is much heralded and maybe the most famous telling of the story of the Civil War. And I did find it mostly compelling reading although I am far from a fan of Civil War history. The portions of the book which retold battle strategy and the movement of troops etc. etc. were most arduous for me. And there was a lot of that. But the stories about what was going on inside the heads of the people was often compelling and fascinating. The book is told predominately from the union point of view Which must be particularly irksome for southern readers. But it just confirms what most everyone knows which is that the winners get to tell the story of the wars. I have just recently read a biography of Robert E Lee so I had a little bit of that point of view in my head.I always thought trench warfare began in World War I. But in reading the biography of General Lee and finding that he was trained as an engineer and relied heavily on digging trenches and digging in artillery, I was not surprised. Possibly the biggest difference between trenches in the Civil War and in World War I were how close they were to each other. Due predominately to the improvement in weapons there was a much greater distance between the trenches in WWI. In the Civil War the trenches were sometimes very close to each other.One of the more interesting things shown was the occasional camaraderie between soldiers on opposite sides. The final confrontation between the two sides at the very end ended without gun fire with opposing sides faced off. Out pops a rebel with the white flag and both sides end the fighting to let the generals work out the details. I gave this book 3 stars instead of four mostly because this is just not a book that I enjoyed a lot. It\u2019s not really my kind of book. But I was left feeling amazed that you could get thousands of men to stand up and run across the field while people on the other side shot at you. And there were of course the incredible descriptions of bodies piled up two or three high. Incredible and unbelievable.The story of Grant and Lincoln meeting once it seemed like the outcome was determined but not yet reached has probably been told over and over. They both favored fighting all out until the war was finished but then taking a fairly \u201clet bygones be bygones\u201d with the south once the war was over. The story of how they would get that to happen is left for another book. The opposing soldiers on the battlefield seemed willing to slap each other on the back and say they were all the same when it came right down to it but the bigger picture between the north and the south after the war was hardly so positive.I live in Lynchburg Virginia, a town that is very close to Appomattox and is mentioned quite a few times in the book as just being up or down the road. Lynchburg was apparently always trying to be prepared for the onslaught of the war but was primarily used as a location for hospitals and treating the wounded. This book does make me want to learn a little bit more about the role of Lynchburg but somehow I think I won\u2019t do it because ultimately I\u2019m just not drawn to the topic."}, {"userName": "Robert Snow", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15373887-robert-snow", "userReview": "I read \"A Stillness at Appomattox\" while touring the Richmond / Petersburg area at the end of May.

This is a good book to read in order to understand the command structure, the middle leadership of the Army and the logistics of getting an Army ready to attack and then pressing forward, failing and pressing forward ever so slowly cutting supply lines and turning Lee's flank around Petersburg.

Sheridan finally puts his army south of Early in the Shenendoah Valley, lays waste to the countryside and is finally able to rout Early\u2019s army. Sherman takes Atlanta, Richmond falls and Grant has Meade\u2019s troops surrounding Lee and the final surrender.This is a book written for the general reader as well as the scholar and keeps you enthralled to the end.

This is the final volume of the Army of the Potomac trilogy written by Bruce Catton about the Civil War. After spending some time visiting historical sites in and around Richmond, VA, I particularly wanted to read this account of the last year of the Civil War. In 1954, it won both the Pulitzer Prize for history and the National Book Award for non-fiction.In A Stillness at Appomattox, Catton walks his readers through the various battles that took place during that final bloody year of the Civil War. We gain glimpses into the character, relationships, military movements, and stratagems of major players such as Grant, Sheridan, and Lee, as well as of numerous more minor characters in that great tragedy. We see moments in which, but for this or that misstep, the way could have ended months (maybe years) earlier, saving untold thousands of lives. The Battle of the Wilderness, the Bloody Angle, the numerous battles in and around Cold Harbor, the massively destructive explosion (and squandered opportunity) of the Crater, and many others come to life through Catton's writing. Just a few days before reading this book, I had been wandering through these same battlefields, imagining the troop maneuvers and encounters, picturing to myself the circumstances in which so many men with differing loyalties, but similar values, found themselves. Standing near the edge of the Crater, I could almost see the stunned expressions on the faces of those who saw the land rupture and explode from within, and hear their anguished cries. My only disappointment was that there wasn't more about the immediate aftermath of the war, the encounter of Grant and Lee at the courthouse, and the dissolution of the armies. I would like to have learned a bit more their experiences following the war. But that is a very minor complaint when held up against the vast sweep of the Civil War saga thoroughly and expertly covered in Catton's account. Well done!"}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29560882-dave", "userReview": "For anyone interested in the Civil War or American history in general, author Bruce Catton's trilogy of books should be on your short list of 'must reads'. \"A Stillness at Appomattox\" is Catton's final book on the Army of the Potomac. This book follows the army from 1863 when U.S. Grant took command to Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse in April 1865. The first two books, \"Mr. Lincoln's Army\" and \"Glory Road\" take the reader through the first two and a half years of war. Together, these three volumes are a masterpiece of historical narration.In my opinion, this third volume, \"A Stillness at Appomattox\" is the best of the trilogy. Catton's writing, research, and use of primary resources (diaries, letters, and original records) is excellent. He describes the army's actions and movements in detail, and relates that to the experiences of individual soldiers, officers, and leaders in superb detail. His prose draws the reader into the emotional and physical experiences of the people involved and paints vivid pictures of the horrors of this war. At the end, if you don't have a catch in your throat as the armies realize the killing is finally over, you haven't paid attention. A 6 star read and highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12053631-kevin", "userReview": "Bruce Catton is from my hometown: Petoskey, Michigan. There is a statue of him outside of the Petoskey Carnegie Library where I checked out books as a child. I have read his short memoir \"Waiting for the Morning Train\" as well. In it, he writes, very beautifully, of how he, during his own childhood, used to listen to the old men tell stories of their Civil War days, and how the stories would awaken in him a certain poetical feeling.In his book, he passes the poetical feeling along to us. It includes amazing scenes: recounting the difficulties of integrating recently freed slaves into the army, and the songs they would sing around the campfires at night, about how deep inside General Grant was still \"the young officer who longed to get away from camp and parade ground and live quietly as a teacher of mathematics,\" and about how, at the peak of the war \"the nation itself had been heated to an unimaginable pitch ... and now it had been put on the anvil, and the hammer was remorselessly coming down, beating a glowing metal into a different shape.\"However, the beauty of his language is offset by the horror that he describes. I suppose I had been saving myself for greater maturity before I approached the US Civil War. Now I feel I was right, the casualty counts seem inflated by an order of magnitude over what I have ever read about before: according to Catton, at its peak, the Civil War was resulting in 2,000 Union deaths per day ... that's averaging out the single day battle counts, during which losing 7,000 soldiers was routine.Worse than the numbers of casualties alone, is the sickening feeling of confusion and senselessness. For example, when he describes the Battle of the Crater. During the long siege of Petersburg, a group of soldiers, who were professional coal miners, sold their commanding officer on the idea of digging a tunnel 500' under the enemy lines, then exploding a massive charge, and charging on the lines at the same instant. In this way they could break the siege. The problem is the officers didn't really take the scheme seriously. The miners succeeded totally in exploding the enemy's lines, however, the army was not prepared to exploit the breech, and took a very long time to charge, eventually going down into the crater created by the explosion, then becoming trapped there, and easily killed by the reformed Confederate lines.It's an almost inexplicable story, and sheds light more, for me, on just how tired, hungry, and ill, these men were, and additionally, likely poorly educated with little ability to communicate using writing or maps.Additionally, I believe there is insight into the reasons behind the bitterness of \"civil wars\" as a genre. Catton points out the high casualty and long length of the war stemmed from the confusion, mixed loyalties and general overall stew going on in the country\u2019s leadership at the time: some generals were appointed for strictly political reasons, and not war leadership competence. Washington DC, located within a day's travel of much of the fighting, would attempt to control the situation, resulting in muddled instructions. After 3 years, Lincoln appointed Grant as 'Lieutenant General' (overall commander of the army entire) in a move of power consolidation, and even then it remained difficult to limit the micromanaging.All in all this book is not difficult to read, it's exhaustively researched, detailed and easy to follow, with numerous fascinating asides into relevant areas. As a stretch goal, it's highly literary, and hits a mature note when summing up: it occasionally presents the war as glorious and \"sacred,\" but then it quickly turns bitter, showing at least the glamor, if not the sacredness, to have been an illusion, and then immediately cataloguing the awful consequences of the violence ... Although it's not difficult to read, it is a difficult read, in that it leaves you with a heaviness and sadness and a wish that the Civil War might somehow have been avoided, but still remarking on how much the character of the country was, in a sense, created, by that trauma."}, {"userName": "Keith Lovell", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15281252-keith-lovell", "userReview": "A little dry but overall a nice union perspective of the end of the war in Virginia."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/719560-elizabeth-kennedy", "userReview": "I loved reading this beautifully written series, which is part love song, part elegiac hymn to the ordinary Union soldier."}, {"userName": "Margaret Harris", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41188828-margaret-harris", "userReview": "The title of this book is misleading, for there is no \"stillness\" until the last paragraph of the last page. We read, rather, a powerful and exquisitely written story of the final thirteen months of American Civil War noise\u2014the thundering boom of cannon, rat-tat of a thousand muskets, zinging rifle fire, clomping horses, crunching wagon wheels, yells from infantrymen making attack, raging fires of woods and buildings, and screams and cursing by wounded men lying between enemy lines.The sounds begin with music, at a dance in Washington on February 22, 1864, to celebrate the first president's birthday. Union officers in dress uniforms dance with their wives and ladies wearing colorful hoop-skirted gowns. It is the last time the men will be clean for another year. But the officers will be cleaner than the soldiers in the ranks, who will march through mud or dust, pounding rain, numbing cold, and sweltering heat, between halts to dig endless deep trenches and fight ferocious battles along a two-month trek for 150 miles to Petersburg, Virginia, where the survivors will live in filth and misery for another ten months until their final breakout to war's end at Appomattox Court House in April 1865. Besides ear-shattering noise, their eyes will witness unspeakable scenes\u2014when cannonballs hit men and scattered their body parts, blood, torn flesh, mutilated faces\u2014and their noses will be assaulted by the stench of medical tent hospitals amputating gangrenous limbs, of unburied corpses, or just unwashed bodies, grimy clothes, and camp sewage.It is the last campaign of General U.S. Grant, after he has been appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac following his successful defeat of Confederate armies in the western section of the southern states. The Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee will not go down easy. Indeed, in the 1864 springtime confrontations at The Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and Richmond, it will not go down at all. But both armies sacrifice thousands of soldiers in the desperate fight against each other, and Bruce Catton walks us through the heartbreak of it all. At the ten-month siege of Petersburg both sides spend a long summer, then a long winter, marked by intermittent efforts to break impenetrable defense fortifications.Mr. Catton puts his readers there by referencing the letters and memoirs of the soldiers themselves. We live again with them their exhaustion, frustration and fury\u2014and their courage, determined will, and compassion for each other as well as for the enemy soldiers they faced. And he does not leave out the story of the weary generals\u2014and of President Lincoln himself\u2014who struggled not only to defeat Lee's Army but also against civilian news editors and Union political foes who publicly advocated quitting the fight.No other of at least three dozen books I have read about the American Civil War\u2014not even James McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom\u2014can compare with the beautiful writing of this award-winning volume.

He also provides some descriptions on battles that weren't fought by the AotP but had an effect on the war nonetheless like the Shenandoah campaign by Sheridan and the failure by Butler on the Bermuda Hundred campaign. The most touching story was the tragedy of Petersburg, not just the malfeasance on part of the commanders who failed their duty before the Confederates established the defense after all the opportunity was wasted but also the Crater with all its low points especially the lack of true leadership. Again, I couldn't give this 5 stars as with most of my comments, I hate books that describes troop movements but fail to accompany them with a map or maps."}, {"userName": "R.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23305080-r", "userReview": "'A Stillness at Appomattox' shares the battles of the Wilderness, the Bloody Angle, Cold Harbor, the Crater, the Battle of Fort Stevens and on through the surrender at Appomattox. This final volume of The Army Of The Potomac trilogy relates the final year of the American Civil War, and Catton shares the pathos of the time. It is a stirring account of the longest year, and shares a detailed history of the Union army.Compared to works such as 'A Savage War: A Military History of the Civil War', the military context (distances, infrastructure, and nationalism) is not quite so examined, but the events and movements which had historic after effects are highlighted. Catton's history is peppered with the writings of spectators and participants of the time in the work. Quotations of letters by Federal soldiers, personal diaries of spouses and relatives, memoirs of soldiers and their families and official war records add to the drama."}, {"userName": "Matthew Perry", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56501070-matthew-perry", "userReview": "If you are unfamiliar with Bruce Catton, he was arguably the most renowned and well-respected Civil War historian of the 20th century. His works have stood the test of time, even forty years after his death. In his last installment of the \u201cArmy of the Potomac Trilogy\u201d, Catton tracks the end of the war from the summer of 1864 to the surrender at Appomattox in April of 1865. Told with stunning clarity and amazing narrative, Catton weaves the successes and failures of both armies through the dying days of the war. While I don\u2019t love to give perfect ratings, it would be utterly pretentious for me to give this masterpiece anything less than a perfect rating. It is geared towards the enthusiast, but I feel anyone with a passing interest in the Civil War would thoroughly enjoy the book."}, {"userName": "Aaron Crofut", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4096056-aaron-crofut", "userReview": "Bruce Catton is the Yankee version of Shelby Foote, and I hardly have higher praise than that. A beautiful little book about a savage time, where the high politics and strategic maneuvering enter the story only as it relates to life for the average Union soldier. The Army of the Potomac is no longer an army of volunteers or idealism, but a hard, \"regular\" force led by a determined driver who means to end the war come hell or high water. The man who really stands out in all of this is Phil Sheridan. It's not pleasant, but wars are won with such men. This is the kind of book that makes you sad when it ends."}, {"userName": "Bobsie67", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1102847-bobsie67", "userReview": "Calton's description of the battle at Spottsylvania is devastating.

Wonderful writing! Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Robin Friedman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22269025-robin-friedman", "userReview": "Bruce Catton's \"A Stillness at Appomattox\" was the first adult Civil War book I attempted after, many years ago, I was captivated by a series of Civil War stories geared to pre-teens. Since that time, I have continued to read about the Civil War and recently have recaptured something of my boyish fascination with the subject -- I hope at a more thoughtful level. I was reluctant to struggle with this particular book again because of the memory of my struggle with the book as a child. But I needed at last to go back to it to round out my reading of other works by Catton.Catton's book tells the story of the Civil War in the East beginning in the winter of 1863 following the Battle of Gettysburg. The first thing to notice about the book is the clear, lyrical quality of the prose which somehow frustrated me as a child. Catton writes in a propulsive forward-moving style. He tends to like long sentences joined with series of \"ands\". This makes his account move quickly although sometimes a bit stringingly. Also Catton has a gift for lyrical metaphors to drive home his points -- whether in describing the fields or in describing the emotions of the men. His writing at its best has a poetical, moving quality. Most importantly, Catton writes lucidly. His descriptions of the battles and of troop movements are relatively easy to follow. Many of the accounts I have read since I first tried this book are detailed and ponderous. This is never the case with Catton. He gives a good, basic picture of the battles he describes which will stand the reader looking for more detailed accounts in good stead.Besides the quality of the writing, A Stillness at Appomattox is notable for the story it has to tell. Broadly speaking, Catton focuses on how the Civil War changed after its first two years, and he explains why. Although the carnage of the first two years of the war was immense, the scope of the war increased markedly following Gettysburg. The Civil War became the first total war, bringing trench warfare, sustained fighting, destruction of property, and hardship to noncombatants in its wake. Many later writers have also made this point, but Catton unforgettably drives it home.Catton thus describes the final Union campaign in the East (There is little in the book on the Western theatre of the War.) of the Army of the Potomac from the Wilderness through Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, and Appomatox. He describes the desperate, harsh nature of these engagements under the leadership of U.S. Grant. Catton also pays a great deal of attention to Philip Sheridan, to the destruction he wrought in the Shenendoah Valley Campaign, and to his key roles in the Battle of Five Forks (Petersburg) and the final race to the Appomattox Court House. Catton's discussion of Sheridan brought home to me the cruel all-out nature of the final stages of the War.Catton also integrates well the military aspects of the Civil War with the political aspects. There are good pictures of Lincoln and of the war-weariness of the North which threatened the military efforts of the Armies until the last phases of the conflict. Catton's work emphasizes, in line with recent scholarship, the critical role of African-American soldiers in the Union's war effort. But he also tends to support a reconciliationist approach following the end of the conflict rather than what might have been a more committed attempt to protect the rights of the Freedmen. Although Catton writes from the Union side of the line, he clearly is impressed with the military and personal character of Robert E. Lee and with the valor shown by the Army of Northern Virginia under the most trying of circumstances.I was enthralled by the pace of the book, by Catton's writing, and by his love for and knowledge of his subject. This is a book to come to as an adult. It will encourage the thoughtful reader to reflect upon the Civil War as the watershed event in our Nation's history.Robin Friedman"}, {"userName": "Harlieu Katz", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82198587-harlieu-katz", "userReview": "My father and I read this together, I was 13 and we shared a deep love of history.
