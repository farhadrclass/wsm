The hairs stood on the back of my neck as this was something I had never ever thought about as Ireland had been neutral in the past wars and while thousands of young Irish men volunteered to fight the Germans alongside the British in World War II conscription was not a factor. I dread the empty nest syndrome when College comes into play  But what must a parent feel when a Child is drafted in Wartime to fight...........for me it just doesn't bear thinking about and when I saw this book I felt I needed to read it as this small town had lost so many to WarJune 6, 1944: Nineteen boys from Bedford, Virginia--population just 3,000 in 1944--died in the first bloody minutes of D-Day. They were part of Company A of the 116th Regiment of the 29th Division, and the first wave of American soldiers to hit the beaches in Normandy. Later in the campaign, three more boys from this small Virginia town died of gunshot wounds. Twenty-two sons of Bedford lost--it is a story one cannot easily forget and one that the families of Bedford will never forget.The book is well written and the war scenes well depicted and gut wrenching but the author focuses more on the human element of the story with so many interviews from family members and surviving soldiers and letters home from men that would never return. So many young men died instantly on D. Day and as one of the Interviewees stated  the heroes were not only the ones who died but also the ones who came home and lived with these images for the rest of their lives.A worthwhile and engaging read that focuses on the sacrifices made by these men and their families and a book that will stay with me."}, {"userName": "A.L.

With no alternative, the boys, as new members of the U.S. Army, A Company, 116th Infantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division were quickly swept away for escalated extensive training in distant locations. The book is very griping at times. I was personally saddened to comprehend and read the accounts of some members, who looked forward to an emotional farewell visit home that never materialized.

Company A was largely composed of residents of Bedford, VA. population 3000 in 1944, 22 Bedford Boys didn't return From Europe.Kershaw relies on first person interviews for the bulk of the book, which gives the combat scenes a visceral quality. Kershaw takes you right down to the water line, as bullets whiz past your ear, and you wait for the ramp to drop. I have read many books on WWII, and these combat scenes are the best I've ever come across.What sets Kershaw's narrative apart however is his ability to juxtapose the combat scenes with scenes from the homefront so as to give the reader a more complete understanding of the true cost of war.The Bedford Boys is my #2 book of 2003, and my #5 book of the decade."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10999025-john", "userReview": "I tend to favor regimental histories, or personal memoirs of World War II experiences. I thought this paean to the lost men of Bedford, VA would be maudlin, or trite. I was wrong. Alex Kershaw completed meticulous research, interviewed countless townspeople, family members, and survivors, and researched the regiment so thoroughly that the reader feels he knows the members of Company A. Yes, I realized what was coming. But, Kershaw didn't dwell on the landing and the death of the soldiers from Bedford. Instead, he struck an excellent balance, talking of family, depression challenges, advanced training, and the thoughts of the soldiers. He captured the aftermath of the war, and the pain, sorrow, and slow recovery for many, but not for all. It is a very good read, and one worth the investment for someone wanting a better understanding of the social history of war."}, {"userName": "Shane Gower", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5472106-shane-gower", "userReview": "Sad, compelling, and important. The story this book tells is infinitely relatable to anyone who lived in a small town in America. My Grandfather served in the war and grew up in a very similarly sized town in Maine. I remember hearing their stories of how the war impacted the town. I can't imagine the impact on the town if 19 of its own had died in one day. This is what happened to Bedford, VA and why the author chose the title he did. I recently travelled to Bedford, VA to visit the National D-Day Memorial located there. While perusing the gift shop, my eye caught this book and so I bought it. Having toured the memorial, and driven around the small town of Bedford, the story was so much more meaningful and heartbreaking. In many ways this story symbolizes what the war was all about. The sacrifice made by the people of this town was great and we owe them a great deal. This book does a great job of following the boys through training at Fort Meaded, in Florida, in New Jersey, and then the agonizing months in England waiting for their chance at combat. The author brings several of the Bedford boys to life so that when they die on the beach you feel the impact even more. Company A was chosen to be the first to hit the sands at Omaha Beach where casualties would be the highest. Most of the Bedford boys were in Company A and so many died soon after hitting the beach on D- Day, some without ever having fired a shot at the enemy. The author does a nice job interviewing the families of the Bedford boys as well as those few who survived to show how the war impacted the community and what led to the building of the memorial. Bedford was chosen by the US Congress as the site for the memorial because it had way more of its citizens die per capita on D Day than any other Allied town or city in the world. It was hard to put this book down, but if you are interested in it, please visit the National D Day Memorial in this town. The Memorial is very large and magnificent and well worth one's time. It makes the book even more relatable and compelling. It's hard to explain but when I got out of the car and looked at the Memorial with its \"Overlord\" arch, it's marble replica of a Higgins Landing craft, and the bronze soldiers struggling up a faux beach with water around them surrounded by the glorious Blue Ridge mountains and peaceful quiet of a small town, I just got goose bumps. The whole thing is just perfect, I think the Bedford boys would approve. Great book and great story!"}, {"userName": "Lch", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29766272-lch", "userReview": "Gripping account on how personal war was and will be. Since Spielberg\u2019s Saving Private Ryan it is well-known how much the first waves of soldiers suffered on Omaha Beach. It happened to be that a lot of the Bedford Boys were at the wrong place at the wrong time: the dog green sector at Vierville on June 6, 1944. Kershaw builds the story up in a traditional way, with all the training and preparations that the men went through. What I did not really expect, but appreciate, is the detailed description of the actual fighting and aftermath. In this way the book is a valuable military addition to the works of (among others) Ambrose, Ryan and Beevor."}, {"userName": "Jessie Gussman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24376684-jessie-gussman", "userReview": "An interesting book on D-Day, focusing mainly on the men from one town in Virginia who happened to be some of the first to step, and fall, on the French sand.

And by events I'm not talking about the Montgomerys, the Eisenhowers, or the Churchhills. But rather the group of boys (for so many of them were incredibly young) who were the first ones to storm the beaches at Normandy; the first group of soldiers to die on June 6, 1944; and the small little Virginia town that was never the same after they lost so many of their husbands and brothers in just one day. Bedford had the unfortunate distinction of suffering the highest one-day loss of any U.S. town (a population of only 3,000, it lost 21 men on June 6). It was heartbreaking to read about the men whose lives were cut short much too soon but then even more so when reading about the survivors, the men who survived D-Day and the rest of the war but then suffered from immense guilt and PTSD for the rest of their lives, always wondering why they made it through when 21 of their fellow brothers did not. And of course the lives of their families who were never the same after they received those telegrams letting them know their loved one would never be coming home. There are fewer and fewer WWII veterans still living but reading books like this helps to keep the memory and the unimaginable things they did alive."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27122833-mark", "userReview": "The author tells the story of boys from Bedford Virginia who as part of the National guard participated as part of Company A in the D-day invasion of Normandy on Omaha beach.

There were many times I had tears in my eyes as I read. War is so cruel. Something that those that fought in will never get over. I have always wondered why people that went to war did not talk about it later. I thought it was because it was so terrible to describe what they endured and witnessed.

Loving families and young men who joined the CCC and the National Guard to earn money during the Depression. Farmers and factory workers and folks just trying to get by. D-Day changed everything for Bedford, and the reverberations are still being felt by the people who were living there then, and who are descended from them. Bedford is the community in the United States that lost the most people in any one day during the War. Because the National Guard was formed into the Army units that served, this meant that units seeing action were sometimes formed entirely of people from the same communities. Sometimes these groups included family members. During heavy combat, you can imagine what will happen. Back in Bedford, the dreaded telegrams came, and came, and came after the 6th of June, 1944. Alex Kershaw shines a light on the boys who left Bedford for England in order to serve their country. He tells us what their training was like, the horrors they saw even before they got to England, and how they attempted to cope with the unmitigated carnage of Omaha Beach. If you think PTSD is a new thing, you'd be mistaken. Back at home, Kershaw tells us what it was like for the families who were left behind. How nervewracking it was to wait for news and not know if your loved one was still alive, and then the abject, unsoothable grief that came along with the telegram. There were men who survived, and were forever changed. There were men who never even made it to the beach. There were families whose lives became calendars of \"before D-Day\" and \"after D-Day.\" The connecting thread is Bedford itself, where the National D-Day Memorial is fittingly located and where these young men are still fondly remembered. Thanks to Alex Kershaw and his beautifully-written, fascinating and heartbreaking book, their stories will continue to be told."}, {"userName": "Ted Duke", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6864706-ted-duke", "userReview": "If you know nothing of the sacrifices of the young people (and their families) who served during WWII protecting our freedoms, YOU MUST read this book.

The book shows resemblance toward the movie \u201cSaving Ryan\u201dPrivate. The novel follows a rough journey of brave men during the bloodiest year of WWII in which half of them will not come home. The book tells the real story of war and the amount of loss and grief that every soldier has to deal with.The Bedford boys enlist in the military. However, it was the worst time to ever to this which later will come with huge consequences.The boys go to England and while they were there they get intel that over 200,000 men are deployed into action and more than a quarter have perished. The Bedford Boys are scared and they know that it's not just any war. The commander said to everyone, \u201cWhen you're scared you show defeat toward the enemy\u201d (Kershaw). This was a turning point to the characters\u2019 emotions. Over the course of the novel, The Bedford boys go through tough times in the military. While deployed the boys come together and make a pact. Then during D-Day they go through huge emotions. For example, one of the scariest parts of war was hearing men crying for their \u201cMom\u201d or saying they \u201cwanna go home\u201d before dying. This made Bedford boys distraught to fight. I strongly recommend this book because it shows the real life effect of war and that war is not a fantasy. Also it shows what war can do to you while in service and what could happen during months of in service. The book showed great inspiration for the boys.
