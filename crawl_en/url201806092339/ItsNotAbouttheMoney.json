For those who are not familiar with Bob Proctor, he is one of the best motivational speakers of our time. I purchased it thinking it was something totally different, but boy was I in for a great surprise. The way Bob breaks down how we can set realistic financial & life goals was great. Plus, he forces us to really take an inventory of what we love to do, what we're good at doing and if we focus on that and doing it well, then the money will follow.I would recommend this book to everyone looking for a lasting and meaningful change in their lives.Enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21721296-mike", "userReview": "I've read many books on the law of attraction. Napoleon Hill is my mentor, but Bob Proctor has really mastered the method of articulating the law in the clearest way I've yet to encounter. If you can't grasp the concept from listening to him, you probably never will."}, {"userName": "Yaakov Bernadyn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36539370-yaakov-bernadyn", "userReview": "Disclosure: I listened to the audiobook.I guess I'm getting more and more confused by this Law of Attraction business. In all fairness, I do believe that positive thinking begets great things. I might even buy that people flock to those that closely resemble their values.Now, spoiler alert ahead. The law of attraction essentially works like this (according to this book): If great things happen to you because you thought positively, you caused that but if negative things happen to you it is your fault that you attracted that, as well. So, this is untestable. It's the old damned if you do and damned if you don't. Very cult like if you ask me.I wasn't impressed. Nerve wracking. Back to my business, philosophy, and thriller genres. Law of Attraction? Um, I think not."}, {"userName": "David Geschke", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8986449-david-geschke", "userReview": "Well, after reading Bob Proctor's book \"You were born rich\", which I consider one of the best books I've ever read, I had to read \"It's not about the money\" as well. GREAT book on the mindset needed to create wealth in all areas of your life. I'm reading anything Bob Proctor puts out from now on. I put both books in the top 10 of the \"creating wealth\" books I've read along with \"Think & Grow Rich\" - Napoleon Hill and \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" - Robert Kiyosaki to name a few..."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6899594-alex", "userReview": "You can't beat Bob Proctor. His points are so profound yet so basic. Makes you think about society and what silly standards we often put up with when we don't really need to! We were all born wealthy and its up to us to \"cash\" in on our potential.Listened to twice! Feb '13 and then again in March '15. Always new insights when you get in touch with Bob's material :)"}, {"userName": "Mark \"Lefty\" Holencik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17375911-mark-lefty-holencik", "userReview": "If you go to work for the money it is work.

Bob Proctor is awesome!"}], "description": "The valuable lesson contained in this book is that the best way to attract prosperity is to abandon the pursuit of wealth and allow it to flow toward oneself. The ancient laws of attraction are explained in plain language and applied in an economic framework\u2014a new perspective not found in other popular explications of these principles. A path to prosperity is offered in tandem with guidance for achieving harmony in both professional and personal spheres while strategies to overcome destructive thinking patterns and to sustain the flow of wealth while channeling it constructively are delineated. Profiles of individuals who pursued their passion rather than profit, and subsequently reaped immense rewards, will inspire those seeking to transform their lives.", "title": "It's Not About the Money", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3316089-it-s-not-about-the-money", "average": 4.25, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328696193l/3316089.jpg", "reviews": 11, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/72625.Bob_Proctor", "name": "Bob Proctor"}], "type": ["Currency", "Self Help"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3316089-it-s-not-about-the-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/685190.You_Were_Born_Rich", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25310606-the-art-of-living", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398988-the-abcs-of-success", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24098638-thoughts-are-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13493852-goal-achiever"]}
