It hits all the Sherlock and zombie formulaic notes and doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. Moriarity, Mycroft, England in peril, London overrun with zombies and oh yeah, let\u2019s hit them/shoot them/do the stabby to them. In the noggin. It's elementary, kids.I say, brilliant deductive reasoning and all that.Bottom Line: If you\u2019re not sick of zombies and/or Sherlock Holmes, give it a go.Oh, and don\u2019t let Mrs. Hudson near a loaded weapon.What a fiendish turn of events!

This is Holmes in Rathbone mode, a smart, dynamic man of action who solves the mystery and saves the day by bravery and initiative as much as deduction - which is not at all out of character, just one possible perspective. It can be argued that Holmes should be disproving the supernatural, as he did in the case of the Sussex Vampire, but zombieism is presented as a phenomena that is amenable to scientific analysis. The interplay between Holmes and Watson (and Mycroft) is nicely done, the scenes under London are excellent and the great detective actually does do his fair share of detecting, even if you have to pay attention to notice it amongst the more overt hi-jinks."}, {"userName": "Devann", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4135942-devann", "userReview": "Look, it's just ...exactly what it says on the tin.

In March 1854, an alien ship lights up the skies above London. Some thirty years later, Scotland Yard calls on Holmes and Watson to investigate the odd occurrence of the dead who refuse to stay dead. Edginton wisely populates his tale with classic Holmesian elements: Mrs. Watson, Mycroft, Lestrade, and most importantly Holmes himself deducing the opaque and improbable. Eschewing the trend to portray Watson as a buffoon, in Victorian Undead the war veteran and respected physician functions as an valued ally and aide-de-camp. Additionally, unlike Tony Moore's cover, artist Fabbri illustrates Holmes in the far more accurate bowler and suit than the popular deerstalker cap and Inverness cape coat, an ensemble never worn in the city. As Holmes digs further, he discovers a massive government cover up and a long-dead foe's horrific machinations. A visual delight, the well written Victorian Undead: Sherlock Holmes vs Zombies emerges as a welcome addition to the Holmes mythos."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2756498-christine", "userReview": "If you can say \" a fun twist\" on a story about zombies that is how I would describe this book.

While Max Brooks may have written the current authoritative guide to the zombie fighting biz, it seems that Elizabeth Bennet, Ebenezer Scrooge and even Abraham Lincoln each had their own preferred fighting method and it now appears that even Sherlock Holmes threw his [deerstalker?] hat into the proverbial [zombie infested] ring. In Victorian Undead: Sherlock Holmes vs Zombies, Ian Edginton and Davide Fabbri take the world\u2019s most famous consulting detective and his trusty sidekick Doctor Watson on a hilarious and horrific romp through the zombie infested streets of Victorian London.In March of 1854 a group of cockney clich\u00e9s witness a meteor streaking across the sky above London and, as the masses stare in awe, one wise biddy predicts doom. It turns out that biddy was on to something as, only a few months later, London has been gripped by a deadly plague that is baffling scientists [John Snow gets to make his long overdue comics debut at this point]. Although deadly probably isn\u2019t the right word as the plague victims show a troubling tendency not to stay dead for long. Fortunately, the zombie outbreak is limited to a relatively small area of the city and so the government are able to contain [read: eradicate] the undead hordes and hush the whole business up.However, zombies are a pesky bunch and they don\u2019t stay hushed up for long. Twenty years after the meteor sparked the plague, the undead are once again walking the streets of London. The dastardly and decidedly decaying Professor Moriarty has hatched a devious plan to create his own zombie army in an attempt to overthrow the British government. Fortunately, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson are on the case [Queen Victoria, Demon Hunter presumably being busy with other matters] and are ready to face off against the duel forces of MI5 and the zombies.While horror was no stranger to Victorian London, this is certainly not your common or garden Sherlock Holmes tale. The whole zombie thing is beginning to feel a little played out, particularly in the graphic novel genre where only The Walking Dead seems to have any kind of durability, but Sherlock Holmes vs Zombies is, after a rather slow setup, actually a fairly decent read. Yes, it\u2019s completely bonkers, and highly unlikely to appear to fans of the traditional Sherlock Holmes stories, but it\u2019s still a fun and entertaining romp.Ian Edginton has done a good job of crafty a reasonably likely detective story for Sherlock Holmes to feature in and worked in zombies as plausibly as possible rather than simply cashing in on the current undead trend of wedging zombies in to pretty much every classic tale available. The story is gimmicky and rather disposable but, taken as a whole, offers an exciting, fast-paced adventure that provides an hour or two of shameless escapism. As well as getting the tone of the story right, Edginton also has a good ear for Victorian dialogue so that there are no major dialogue clangers that pull the reader out of the story. The banter between Holmes and Watson is in-keeping with their traditional Conan Doyle style patter and their respective characters come across as authentic.As well as being able to draw a great zombie, Davide Fabbri\u2019s art also sticks close to the traditional portrayal of the characters although he succeeds more with Watson than with Holmes who seems more chiselled and square-jawed here than he should be. The backgrounds are well drawn and coloured and are also generally true to the desired Victorian aesthetic.Unsurprisingly, despite being played straight, Sherlock Holmes vs Zombies is all a bit silly really, but the tone and authenticity of the story set it well above the average zombie comic offering. Apparently, Messrs Holmes and Watson will be battling vampires in the near future."}, {"userName": "The Cannibal", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25756716-the-cannibal", "userReview": "Voil\u00e0 un apocryphe de Sherlock Holmes que j\u2019aime ressortir de mes \u00e9tag\u00e8res de temps en temps.L\u00e0, \u00e7a faisait un certain temps que je ne l\u2019avais plus lu\u2026 Et il me fallait un truc pour mon 665\u00e8me post sur mon blog avant le 666\u00e8me !Pas de diable ou de sorci\u00e8re sous la main (post\u00e9 Black Butler trop t\u00f4t, la 659), donc, on r\u00e9cup\u00e8re les zombies qui puent avant de sortir le diable demain.Ce livre \u2013 un comics en fait \u2013 je l\u2019avais zapp\u00e9 en d\u00e9couvrant sa couverture pour le moins \u00ab horrible \u00bb.On y voyait une sorte de Sherlock Holmes en zombie, bouff\u00e9 par les vers, en d\u00e9composition totale.Bref, peu s\u00e9duisante\u2026 J\u2019imaginais un Holmes en zombie, revenant d\u2019entre les morts, les bestioles en prime. Beurk !C\u2019est sur un forum holm\u00e9sien que j\u2019appris que la couverture \u00e9tait ind\u00e9pendante du contenu (merci \u00e0 Jean-Claude pour l\u2019info, en passant). Il y a des zombies, mais ce n\u2019est pas le grand d\u00e9tective !En fait, la couverture \u00e9tait juste l\u00e0 pour un coup de pub. Cela avait eu l\u2019effet contraire chez moi, ne cherchant m\u00eame \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir cet album.Une fois que je le sus, je me mis en qu\u00eate de cet album et je le d\u00e9vorai, tel un zombie assoiff\u00e9 de chair humaine.Oui, il est bien ! Du moins, pour ceux que la pr\u00e9sence de zombies dans un univers victorien ne rebutent pas.Je n\u2019ai rien contre les zombies, mais ce n\u2019est pas mon genre de pr\u00e9dilection. Walking dead, avec tout le succ\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a, je ne regarderai pas.

Examen r\u00e9ussi : les auteurs ne se sont pas plant\u00e9s.Voyons ce qu\u2019ils nous ont concoct\u00e9 comme histoire\u2026L\u2019histoire d\u00e9marre par un flashback, nous ramenant en 1854 alors qu\u2019un m\u00e9t\u00e9ore traverse le ciel londonien, emmenant dans sa tra\u00eene un mal profond et inconnu.Et, comme un malheur n\u2019arrive jamais seul, c\u2019est forc\u00e9ment sur l\u2019East end que s\u2019abat cette vague de peste zombie. Les gens meurent, reviennent \u00e0 la vie et contaminent les vivants\u2026Oui, pas de nouveaut\u00e9s dans le genre : les bons vieux zombies restent les m\u00eames.Les services secrets r\u00e9ussiront \u00e0 contenir la menace, ensevelissant au passage une partie de la ville pour prendre le maximum de pr\u00e9cautions.Mais 44 ans apr\u00e8s (alors que le quatri\u00e8me de couverture parle de \u00ab 20 ans apr\u00e8s \u00bb), \u00e0 l\u2019aube du XXe si\u00e8cle, le mal refait surface. Mhouhahahaha.Sherlock Holmes est revenu d\u2019entre les morts (fa\u00e7on de parler, hein) apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9pisode des chutes du Reichenbach (mais nous savons qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mort puisque non tomb\u00e9, au contraire de Moriarty \u2013 vous suivez toujours ?) et il est bien d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur ces morts qui ne le sont pas tout \u00e0 fait, quand bien m\u00eame les services secrets le lui interdiraient.Quant \u00e0 l\u2019origine de ce regain de peste moribonde\u2026 Chuut, c\u2019est un secret !Comme je vous le disais, le sc\u00e9nario aurait pu sombrer dans les tr\u00e9fonds de la connerie ou du farfelu, surtout avec une couverture kitch \u00e0 mort et son c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00ab s\u00e9rie B+++ \u00bb.Cela ne laissait pas pr\u00e9sager une v\u00e9ritable histoire, avec une intrigue d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e et bien construite.Bon, je ne vais pas vous mentir non plus, je me suis dout\u00e9e de certaines choses\u2026On sent que l\u2019\u0153uvre de Conan Doyle n\u2019est pas une inconnue pour l\u2019auteur et la passionn\u00e9e de l\u2019\u0153uvre holm\u00e9sienne que je suis, \u00e7a fait toujours plaisir.Gr\u00e2ce soit rendue \u00e0 l\u2019auteur : Watson n\u2019est pas le ben\u00eat de service !

Un plaisir aussi de d\u00e9couvrir que Mycroft, le fr\u00e8re de Sherlock, est \u00e9galement bien utilis\u00e9.N\u2019oublions pas Lestrade et ce bon vieux colonel Moran\u2026 Ironie, pour le colonel.Graphiquement parlant, le dessinateur s\u2019en sort haut la main.Les d\u00e9cors de Londres sont fouill\u00e9s, on a l\u2019impression d\u2019y \u00eatre, les plans sont tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9s et le rendu des sc\u00e8nes d\u2019action sont de bonne facture.Oui, il y a de l\u2019action, des combats et du d\u00e9gommage de zombies \u00e0 la sulfateuse (de l\u2019\u00e9poque), \u00e7a \u00e9clabousse la cervelle et les morceaux un peu partout, mais je vous rassure de suite, \u00e7a tache pas les mains et ce n\u2019est pas en odorama !Bref, une belle variation sur notre l\u00e9gendaire d\u00e9tective tout en introduisant un \u00e9l\u00e9ment fantastique sans (trop) d\u00e9naturer le mythe.Comme pour les b\u00e9d\u00e9s o\u00f9 Holmes \u00e9tait face au suceurs de sang, les auteurs s\u2019en sortent haut la main.Le d\u00e9coupage est tr\u00e8s \u00ab cin\u00e9matographique \u00bb, c\u2019est rythm\u00e9, on ne s\u2019emb\u00eate pas, on frissonne et c\u2019est visuellement soign\u00e9.Le seul probl\u00e8me pourrait venir du trop-plein d\u2019action. Oui, il en faut, mais trop d\u2019action nuit \u00e0 l\u2019action et aurait pu causer la mort de ce bon sc\u00e9nario.Attention, je ne sous-entend pas que le trop-plein d\u2019action est pas l\u00e0 pour masquer le manque de sc\u00e9nario, comme dans certains blockbusters.Non, le sc\u00e9nario est fouill\u00e9, mais nous avons l\u2019habitude de voir (enfin, de \u00ab lire \u00bb) Holmes disserter et aiguiser son sens de l\u2019observation et de la d\u00e9duction. Ici, il le fait moins. J\u2019aurais aim\u00e9 plus de r\u00e9flexion et moins d\u2019action \u00e0 la James Bond (Sherlock a les gadgets en moins).Malgr\u00e9 tout, hormis ce petit b\u00e9mol, j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 un bon moment auquel je ne m\u2019attendais pas du tout.Un r\u00e9cit culott\u00e9, fallait oser, ils l\u2019ont fait, prouvant que avec un bon sc\u00e9nario, rien n\u2019est impossible.Lecteurs sensibles, attention, il y a de la d\u00e9capitation dans l\u2019air\u2026 \u00e7a grouille de vermines et quand il faut s\u2019en d\u00e9barrasser, on ne le fait pas avec de la dentelle.

Para resolver a quest\u00e3o, o governo isolou a \u00e1rea, escondeu os fatos, aterrou o lugar e construiu de novo por cima.Anos depois, j\u00e1 ap\u00f3s a virada do s\u00e9culo e retorno de Holmes do Grande Hiato, dois trabalhadores escavando um antigo t\u00fanel acabam encontrando o que n\u00e3o deveriam e quando Holmes \u00e9 chamado para ajudar na Scotland Yard, \u00e9 para encontrar pessoalmente um zumbi.O problema \u00e9 que aparentemente Moriarty \u2013 que at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o se acreditava morto \u2013 conhecia a hist\u00f3ria da epidemia e tinha se preparado com certa anteced\u00eancia caso seu encontro com Holmes em Reichenbach n\u00e3o fosse de acordo com seus planos.Sim, senhoras e senhores, Moriarty \u00e9 um zumbi. E um zumbi que manteve seu intelecto superior e planeja tomar o mundo com um ex\u00e9rcito de mortos-vivos com fome de c\u00e9rebros.Por que foi mesmo que eu li isso?Ok, a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 bizarra mas, sendo bastante sincera, faz sentido.

It is up to Holmes to uncover the source of the undead before they engulf all of London and he finds himself face to face with an enemy he thought dead. The folks at Wildside have done a fantastic job of bringing the undead masses to England while keeping the focus on Holmes. While there are a few traditional Holmes moments in the series, Holmes also takes on more of an action hero role with more battles and physical actions versus exhibiting the power of deductive reasoning. While it is understandable given the context of the story it would have been nice to see more of those moments. Victorian Undead brings forth some excellent zombie art with all the gore that comes with it and a good story to boot. It comes along at an excellent time, as the graphic novel of Pride, Prejudice, and Zombies has been released and this would make a fine complement. It is important to note that Victorian Undead is not a mash-up, where a classic book has additional content added to it by another author. Rather, this is an imaginative Sherlock Holmes pastiche, which takes the familiar characters of Watson and Holmes and throws them into the incredibly popular zombie plague. This is a highly recommended title for libraries when it comes out in trade paperback in October. While a fun story on its own, it could also be paired with the original stories by Arthur Conan Doyle Holmes, other Sherlock Holmes pastiches, and other graphic novels such as The Hound of the Baskervilles (Illustrated Classics): A Sherlock Holmes Graphic Novel by Ian Edginton, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and I.N.J.

His hair color here is chestnut, which was Jeremy Brett's original hair color before it had to be dyed black for his take on Sherlock Holmes in the award-winning Granada series from 1984 - 1994. Well, I thought it was an interesting detail, anyway.The text is actually quite faithful to the original Sherlock Holmes stories (well, except that zombies exist, but anyway) and a few familiar faces (or what's left of them) pop up here.

The pacing of the series is very much akin to traditional Sherlock Holmes, full of investigative detective work, slow reveals and wonderful dialog. The writer captures the dialog of Holmes and Watson very well.I was also very pleased to see the inclusion of several other characters from the original works (who will remain unnamed for the sake of those who have not read the series yet). The art was good. Not mindblowing but enjoyable and not distracting. Even the zombie plot was plausible and not over the top extraordinary as it could have been. At the end of the series, I truly felt I had read a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Definitely worth checking out."}, {"userName": "Francois Arsenault", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1966449-francois-arsenault", "userReview": "It took me a while to figure out what bugged me about this story. It's pleasant enough while you're reading it and there are fun nods and ingenious ways of working the classic Holmes story elements in. While the dialog doesn't quite ring true, there are some striking visuals. Comets and zombies in victorian London, steampunk-ish artillery to deal with them and buried Edwardian streets. The artwork's pretty enough even if the characters are a little stiff.What didn't work for me is the basic premise that pretty much goes against the classic Sherlock Holmes story. Usually, he is presented with the appearance of the supernatural only to go on and disprove it. Maybe I would have had less of a problem if there had been an actual mystery for him to solve instead of just finding clues to get him to the next location where more of the plot can be explained to him.Nice try overall but a little lacking."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23051470-rachel", "userReview": "Sherlock Homes....zombie apocalypse...not much else need be said. Setting aside the fact that the original Holmes would never have been so open-minded to the supernatural, undead, and non-factual, this is actually a fairly well-conceived idea. Little time is spent on deductions, or Holmes' theatrics, and frankly there is little need for it as the culprit is all too readily revealed as an undead Moriarty who wants to take over London. These events are inserted into history, just like many Holmes tales are, and it bares a style of dialogue that resembles the English from this time period. The illustrations are full of colour and lighting, which together with a smattering of gore, creates an appropriate tone for this mash-up. Purists will undoubtedly wish to avoid this title, but for those seeking something slightly different, a what if scenario if you will, than this action-packed mystery/horror graphic novel is worth a try."}, {"userName": "Oscar", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22438584-oscar", "userReview": "It's Sherlock Holmes and Zombies. What can go wrong? Well, a lot, I should imagine. Zombies are hugely oversaturated, so I was more than prepared to be disappointed by this. But it actually tells a pretty solid Sherlock Holmes story. It's not really meant to fit into the proper canon of Sherlock Holmes, and is more of an alternate take. It's set after Holmes comes back from the dead (though not as a zombie, thankfully).It does the things that all good zombie stories do where it doesn't focus too much on the zombies. They're all part of the mystery, and it's not action set-piece after action set-piece.The art is also very good, in that very detailed way that I like for a lot of zombie things. However, I did feel it was a little \"clean\" in places. There was a fair amount of gore too.A surprising hit for me, and a pleasing, short read that any Holmes fan will likely enjoy."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1975413-matthew", "userReview": "This was more entertaining than it has any business being. The overall plot is derivative but decent, and Edginton does a surprisingly good job with the characterizations of the core Holmes characters. I also appreciated the light Steampunk touches. The artwork overall is pretty strong with some pretty active layout designs, but when we get to the real gore it looked a bit plastic at times. The real weakness to me is that when I pick up a Holmes story I want to see Holmes really solve a mystery (and I want to try to solve it along with him). But it's made pretty plain early on who's behind the zombies, and while the main culprit makes perfect sense I would have liked having a couple of red herrings thrown at me to keep me guessing. Fun, but by no means a necessary read."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9182388-kristen", "userReview": "A fun romp, delicious art, but simply lazy storytelling at points. I was disappointed especially by the inclusion of 20th century weaponry. I was looking forward to Victorean-Era zombie warfare, but that was subverted by the tired \"secret government weaponry\" trope. If it was an attempt at Steampunk, it was simply too unimaginative about envisioning the weaponry for me to recognize it as such.Sherlock also seemed a bit too friendly and not deductive enough. It was more the idea of Sherlock than the Holmes Doyle presents in his narrative.That said, the literary and historical references were top-notch. It's a smart comic, for what it lacks in other areas. Enjoyable, but with definite hitches."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2378632-kate", "userReview": "You would not think to put Sherlock Holmes and zombies together, or at least I wouldn't, but it works out very well! It's very Victorian, very Holmes and Watson fighting the bad guys, but with the addition of an uncontrollable outbreak and the walking dead. What more could you ask for?Bonus points for zombie!Moriarty who is that much creepier in that he is King of the Zombies thanks to some serum he's dreamed up that allowed him to keep his wits.

These are the two words that can help in summarising my feelings about this book. This pastiche portrays Sherlock Holmes as a true hero (supported by some of the best drawings that I have seen in recent graphic novels), and Watson as a worthy individual who can be relied upon even at the most exacting times. Moriarty and his horde of cannibalistic zombies are drawn (literally) with devastating effect, as steampunk and Victoriana (along with references to the canon) combine to give us an immensely enjoyable read. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Cari", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2206459-cari", "userReview": "Some cute in-references to Sherlock Holmes, pretty decent artwork, but that's about it. Holmes doesn't really deduce anything (his main canonical trait!) and Watson is the same portly caricature we see all too often. Story doesn't make a lot of sense, either.

But after the bitter disappointment I felt for the graphic novel of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, I was a bit afraid this book wouldn't live up to its potential. It did!
