I would have certainly checked it out at the library and been equally dissapointed but $... dollars richer.I feel cheated as a reader and a fan because it seems as though Karon took advantage of her fan base. This magazine-length story is marketed to \"appear\" like all her other books, while a quick flick through the pages indicates larger fonts and hyper-margined text pages. While I might have forgiven her for what could have been a publishing decision, Karon obviously left her writing talent elsewhere while penning this story. There was nothing new to add with this addition, and even what there was wasn't written very well. I kept asking myself, \"why bother?\"Well, I've learned a good lesson from this purchase, and I have lost some respect for the author. I'll give her another chance, but not on my dime!"}, {"userName": "Jocelyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3143350-jocelyn", "userReview": "I really liked the part where got to experience the other character's ponts-of-view.

I think it was the quotidian element that captured me. They both faced paralyzing fears before their marriage. That's not uncommon. The work of blending their lives involves decisions and negotiations. No surprise. Their premarital counselling is a tad awkward. Sounds familiar. We see their relationship deepen and open as they approach their wedding day. The letters and prayers are a highlight for me.The word common is related to community. The magic Jan Karon weaves are the responses and reflections of the community around Father Tim and Cynthia. Several residents reminisce about their own courtship and marriage. The wedding cake, flowers, music, jokes, and food are all gifts from the heart, a way for Mitford to enter into the celebration instead of simply spectate. [No spoiler] There is another wedding written about in great detail at the end of the Mitford series of books. I am eager to set the two weddings side by side and admire both."}, {"userName": "Ali", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/804942-ali", "userReview": "Well I said I needed an antidote to the gritty reality of my last read. This certainly fitted the bill. Although the 6th in the Mitford Years series - this story is chronologicaly out of time. It is the story of Father Tim and Cynthia's marriage. Father Tim 62 years old, marrying for the first time, his neighbour, children's writer and illustrator Cynthia Coppersmith. We see Timothy contemplating his marriage, thinking about his feelings for Cynthia as composes a letter, and we see what the marriage of these two lovely people mean to the other characters of Mitford, including of course the adorable Dooley Barlow, the troubled boy Father Tim took into his home a couple of years earlier. It was also wonderful to encounter again the marvelous Miss Sadie - who of course died in an earlier book.

For me, this rewinding of time was not a problem. I loved seeing various Mitfordians as they remembered sweethearts who they had loved...and in some cases, lost. One of my favorite parts is when a lovestruck Father Tim sends his fiancee a letter...by way of his stubborn dog...and as a result we see Cynthia, usually so bubbly and outgoing, as this missive strikes deep within her soul, and she is moved to tears. Cynthia has not been without loss, she has been divorced and her first husband scorned her for not being able to bear children, but she has found her missing piece, her soulmate, within the episocopalian rector.This is a beautiful story, that any fan of the Mitford books will zip right on through, and it comes complete with a picture-perfect ending <3"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/815058-julie", "userReview": "As soon as I realized that the \"sixth book the Mitford series\" was just about a wedding that happened in an earlier book, I took it back to the library.

Nothing soothes the soul like a Mitford novel. Except Christ, that is. These books have been such a blessing to me over the years! Sometimes I yearn for there to be a real Mitford to which I could go and definitely live. All these precious characters have set down roots in my heart, forever to stay!This one is the book celebrating the wedding of Father Timothy Kavanagh and Cynthia Coppersmith. Only the wedding. For more, you'll have to read the rest of the Mitford novels. The love between these two, Father Tim is now 62 and Cynthia in her fifties, is just the most precious thing ever. Father Tim writes to Cynthia, \"I have given my heart only once, and that was to Him. Now He has, Himself, set aside in my heart a room for you.\" Any woman receiving a note with that sentence would just feel the most precious woman in the whole world! And their love for each other is just that precious. Through this and the remainder of the Mitford books. I cherish each one!

This book might be confusing to someone who didn't know the characters.I love the many varied characters in the Mitford series. Uncle Billy Watson is one of my favorites. I love his jokes! I love the way the author takes flawed people and makes them valuable without changing them.Dooley is one of my favorites as well. He doesn't have a big part in this book, but the part he has is significant.

It's also an intimate portrait of the unfolding love between Cynthia and the shy Father Tim, complete with fears and hesitations, professions of commitment, and Barnabas the dog delivering love letters. But there's nothing heavy-handed here. The tensions don't run any higher than wondering if Cynthia will make it to the wedding on time after getting locked inside her own bathroom, or guessing if Esther will make her famous three-layer orange marmalade cake for the reception. Told in the warm, down-home style that Karon has built her reputation on, A Common Life is sweet without being saccharine, charming without being cloying. It's an invitation to a literary reunion of the best kind, and like all weddings, it will probably coax a few tears and plenty of smiles. --Cindy Crosby --I love this series!"}, {"userName": "Joy Gerbode", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5049682-joy-gerbode", "userReview": "This installment in the Mitford series is a quick and easy read, with some details regarding Father Tim & Cynthia and their courtship and wedding.
