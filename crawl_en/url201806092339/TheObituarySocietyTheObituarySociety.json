The first time we go to Grandpa Isaac's home we drive the old beast of a truck across town and a few chapters later the house is across the street and still later it's next door to Aunt Ada's!! Whaaatt???? Also, was the creepy pond behind Ada's or behind Grandpa's because the first time she got rescued they went into Ada's to get changed and the next time she's at the inherited Grandpa Isaac's house. Confusing!!I would have liked to have seen Aunt Ada's character fleshed out a little more, it was lacking some depth.Also, there was a dis-jointedness in the transitions that could probably be polished to make the story flow so much nicer. The last half was better than the first half.I would say to Ms. Randall and all other self-published writers; PLEASE stop believing your friends and family when they offer to edit/proof-read for you!! They ARE NOT unbiased! It's way too exciting to read something your family member, friend, writing group member, etc. wrote that all the little details are missed!Ms. Randall has the talent to be really good if she pays attention, or pays someone to pay attention, to the small details of the story, smoothes out her chapter transitions and makes sure ALL of her main characters have depth and meaning."}, {"userName": "Katie W", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/988087-katie-w", "userReview": "(3.5 Stars) There's something so comforting to me about a novel full of mystery, small town characters, and delicious food. Lila inherits her grandpa's house and goes to live with her aunt in small town Nebraska,\u00a0while deciding what to do with this house. It seems that someone wants her gone and between those threats and the mystery of the pond in her backyard, Lila thinks she's going crazy.As Lila works through the mystery, these interesting characters, and this dangerous mystery, her true character, determination, and bravery are revealed. I think a lot of young people who are city dwellers would be bored with this slower-paced life, but Lila is an exception. Max, her neighbor's grandson, and his daughter, Juniper, have a lot of intrigue and mystery surrounding them, as well. I love the quirky characters and the\u00a0peril is a fun twist, to what I thought was going to be just a smooth-sailing mystery.I thought everything would be resolved by the conclusion, but some things are left open for a continuation in another book. I am curious to how everything ties together.Content: mild violence; very mild romance.*I won a copy through a giveaway, which in no way influenced by opinion."}, {"userName": "Tobias", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4253565-tobias", "userReview": "I agree with many of the other reviewers-- the story had an interesting premise (woman inherits home in grandfather's hometown, decides to start a life there). However, there were just way too many plot holes and the timeline of events was way too confusing. In addition, I feel like the author spent way too much time talking about the baked goods rather than explaining some critical pieces of the plot- for example, I literally had no clue who Uncle David was until the very end (were we supposed to know all along it was Ada's husband?). Also, why was Lila so \"lost\"? I feel like they brushed over her past too much.I also didn't like the supernatural aspect of the book. Like is this supposed to be a chick-lit romance? Or a mystery? Or sci-fi?Overall, I finished this book because I wanted to find out what happens to Lila (and I'm stubborn about finishing books that I start), but getting through this one was a little painful."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13116274-jan", "userReview": "This was disappointing - I was so drawn to the title and the cover of this book. And I really enjoyed the characters and the feel of the town of Auburn. But unfotunately, there were just way too many problems. The chapter transitions were awkward and I found myself confused at times wondering if I missed something. There were also several inconsistencies in details and way too many gramatical errors and mis-spellings. If the author had found a better editor it really could have been a much better story. 2.5 stars though I'm rounding up to three since it has some good elements amidst the problems."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33654562-tina", "userReview": "First, I'll say that I thought there was a decent story buried in this book. Getting to it wasn't all that easy. The characters didn't seem to be very well developed and I found myself confused over the family tree. Part of my confusion was over the original ownership of the house Lila inherited and who chose the Raspberry Rumble paint color. Early in the book, \"Phoebe\" chose the color, but at the end of the book, \"Grandma Elaine\" was given credit. The whole pond thing seemed weird -- are we supposed to believe David was still alive or that his ghost haunts the pond?"}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6328907-chelsea", "userReview": "More reviews available at my blog, Beauty and the Bookworm.Don't let the cover fool you on this one--it's no sugar-sweet chick-lit novel about a group of ladies talking about obituaries. A group of ladies talking about obituaries does appear, but they're not really the focus. No, the focus is something completely different--a girl who just moved to her grandfather's home town to deal with his estate following his death, and who finds that her family history there is a little darker than she thought...and that it's haunting her to this day.This was a great book. The main character is Lila, who takes on the task of renovating her grandfather's long-abandoned home while staying with her great aunt Ada. The longer she stays, the more involved she becomes with the town's other inhabitants including Gladys, one of Ada's best friends; Max, Gladys' grandson, and his quirky daughter Juniper; Asher, the handsome cinnamon-scented lawyer who offers to help Lila with her grandfather's house and estate; and a host of other minor characters who all lend Auburn its small-town charm. But beneath all the sweet cakes and savory \"Rocky Mountain oysters,\" there's a bit of menace about Lila's stay in Auburn, and when someone else turns up dead, it looks like Lila is in far more trouble than a few rusty pipes and bad wires might merit.Randall did a great job with the town of Auburn, making it seem like a real, charming place--though it came across to me as more southern that midwestern. Still, with church auctions and harvest festivals, Auburn was a cute place full of quirky residents, and felt very genuine. The characters had their own quirks and personalities and while not all of them fulfilled vital plot functions, none of them felt outright superfluous, which can be a problem with minor characters. As it was, Auburn felt very complete, and its presence went toward motivating Lila to stay, rather than just serving as a random place in the \"stories have to take place somewhere, so this one will take place here\" vein.I don't want to say too much about the plot, because I don't want to spoil anything, but there were a few slight (SLIGHT!) issues I had with this one that I think I can touch on pretty easily:-It needs a few more line edits. There are a bunch of cases of missing quotation marks, line breaks that make things more confusing, etc. that could easily be done away with, but overall it's very well edited for a self-published title.-I didn't really see a point in Erica's character. I think tension with Max and Lila could have been built very easily without her coming back into the picture, and her involvement in the plot came across as a bit contrived.-There's an element of supernatural here. I didn't dislike it, but it did seem a bit out of place in the story because there's really never any explanation given for it. I think this could have either been worked in better, or done away with entirely--the plot could have easily worked without a supernatural element if other bits had been tweaked just a tiny bit.However, I would like to note that these are very minor complaints, and I really, really enjoyed this title. Randall has a companion novel out, The Stranger's Obituary, that I will definitely pick up the next time I fall into a reading slump, because I have no doubts it will be just as good as this one.A very solid 4 stars out of 5."}, {"userName": "Sabine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7435366-sabine", "userReview": "Lila Moore brings her dead grandpa home so he can rest with his family. The cozy little town of Auburn is charming and the first time in her life Lila feels like she belongs somewhere. She inherits the old house of her grandparents and thinks about staying and renovating the house and learning more about her family. Her great-aunt Ada lets her stay with her and soon she has two handsome men vying for her attention: the sleek lawyer Asher and the nerdy computer geek and single-dad Max. But there are many secrets out there and the pond in the backyard seems to be haunted and soon Lila is not sure if everybody is as welcoming as they seems..What a cozy little book! I was absolutely smitten with the storyline and the writing and loved the mystery and the people of Auburn. The love story was more in the background and the big family secret was interesting but I guessed some of it early on. However, I liked the writing very much and have already downloaded the second book. I hope we get to see a bit more about the little girl Junie with her talents - seems to me like she can see ghosts but it was never really explained what her gift really is besides finding things nobody else can.

The characters were well fleshed out and I felt as though I knew most of the townspeople. Zany happenings, quirky folks and a really intriguing mystery filled out a wonderful story. This was a clean romance with a twist due to the mystery. The characters were \"real\" with everyday issues and as usual with a small town, everyone knew everyone and most of their secrets. I love the way the townspeople cared about each other and helped each other. There were laugh out loud moments and scary moments amidst the intrigue and romance.

There were a few short \u201cflashback\u201d sections with different dates in the past that didn\u2019t seem to go anywhere or add anything. There were supernatural elements that didn\u2019t sit well with the cosy mystery/warm baking \u201cfeel\u201d and only seemed to exist as a deus ex machina to save Lila from the brink of death. Also it seemed to be fine for the good guys to kill the bad guys, but not vice versa. So who decides which is which?
