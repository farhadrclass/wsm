The stores have all been decorated and about the only thing yet be done is the selection of the first annual Haunted House contest. When the winners and runners-up are announced, the second place winner, Ernie Bolton, is livid. The prize is $10,000 and he desperately needs the money to pay his back real estate taxes. Before he leaves, he accuses the head of the judging committee, Lucille Foster, of having swayed the other judges into voting for the winner, Barry Lindquist. The next morning as Liv and Whiskey are out for their morning run, Liv notices that Lindquist's winning display has been damaged. Crossing the vacant lot next door to access the damage, she also calls the sheriff. As the police arrive, actors for the community theatre come to help with the clean-up. It is one that happens to discover the lifeless body of Lucille. Bolton, naturally, becomes a prime suspect, but Liv has her doubts. Where are her designer shoes, where is here car and did her husband really pick her up after award ceremony? So she enlists Ted, her assistant and Chaz, owner of the Celebration Bay Clarion and former investigative reporter to find out who sent Lucille to an early grave.I really enjoy all the characters in this series. Even Janine Tudor, Liv's nemesis has mellowed on this book. Once again, Dolly Hunicutt, owner of the Apple of My Eye Bakery is back helping Liv and keeping Whiskey happy dog treats and BeBe Ford, owner of the Buttercup Coffee Exchange is back with her lattes and tea for Liv and Ted. The Zimmerman sisters are there to help and provide Liv with the lowdown on the local residents and also to provide Whiskey with love and treats while Liv is off sleuthing. Chaz, good ol' Chaz. Liv and Chaze still seem to be dancing about as to possibly starting to date. But with Jonathon Preston in town, and someone Liv knew from her days in New York City, Chaz might have some competition. And Ted, Liv's assistant, seems to know what is going on in town practically before anyone else does and is a very valuable assistant to Liv.

The one downfall I had was the very slow pace of the story. It was making me lose interest very quickly, it took me a few more days than normal to finish because the story was not as exciting. At first the characters seemed very one demintional to me but I loved the small town gossip and rumor mill and the extra marital affairs that made it more interesting and the characters seem more like real, flawed people.FTC Disclosure Thank you to the publisher and/or author for providing us with a copy of this book for review.This did not influence our thoughts in any way.

The residents pull out all the stops. This time, though, in Shelley Freydont's Trick or Deceit, someone wants to ruin Halloween. A vandalized haunted house is one thing. But, event planner Liv Montgomery draws the line at murder.Liv is already nervous. An old friend, Jonathan Preston, is on his way to town to check it out for possible funding from a philanthropic foundation. The fate of the town's community center is in his hands. But, when the Museum of Haunted Horrors is vandalized, Liv fears the house won't be able to open for the town's Halloween celebration. But, it's worse than she thought. In the nearby overgrown lot, amongst the scattered mannequin parts, is the body of one of the judges from the haunted house contest. One haunted house ruined; the owner of another is a suspect. What will Jonathan think about Celebration Bay when he arrives in town? Now, Liv is angry \"that somebody trashed all of Barry's hard work, jeopardized the community center's future, and murdered one of the judges.\" And, the entire town turns to her to fix the problem.Any reader can understand Liv Montgomery's motivation. The townspeople have grown to trust this newcomer, although she's only been in town for a year. \"She planned all the major events in town.

I am so glad I was introduced to this series with this book. Liv and Ted are great characters as is her dog, Whiskey. Shelley creates the perfect small town that you wish you lived in. I felt right at home in Celebration Bay from the very start. Why can't more towns be like the ones in cozy mysteries and Debbie Macomber novels?What I found really unique about this series, is that there's no love interest for Liv. There's some tension between her and Chaz, but nothing really going on.The murder was one that really got you thinking. From the start there are a few suspects and there are enough twists and turns that you are kept guessing until the very end. There were a few times when I was sure it was someone and then...boom! It wasn't.What I really liked about Liv, was that even though she was in the thick of the investigation, but she didn't really do the stupid things that a lot of cozy mystery sleuths do. She worried about the case, but she was really focused on her job.I also hope we get to see more of Yolanda in the upcoming series. I'm all for a real quirky characters, and if that character might be witch.

There are three finalists in the contest for the town\u2019s official Haunted House, and ten thousand dollars will go to the winner, with the rest of the contributions and proceeds funding a new community center. Event coordinator Liv Montgomery has invited her friend Jonathan Preston, the debonair CEO of a philanthropic organization, hoping he will award a grant to the center.But after the Museum of Yankee Horrors wins first place, the transformed Victorian boarding house is vandalized \u2026 and among scattered mannequins of Hester Prynne, Lizzie Borden, and the Headless Horseman, a real dead body is found\u2014one of the contest judges. Now in addition to playing host to Jon, Liv has to play detective and coordinate the clues to unmask a self-appointed judge, jury, and executioner. (Goodreads)Review:Trick or Deceit, the fourth installment in the Celebration Bay Mystery series, is a fun romp for readers who, like me, enjoy fall and holiday themed cozies.Celebration Bay is a bucolic, charming, small town in New York that is making a name for itself as a holiday tourist destination. It is in desperate need of a new community center and has planned a haunted house competition for the residents with all proceeds going towards a new center. Liv, who is the town\u2019s event coordinator, is overseeing the Halloween fun and hopes that Jon, her friend from her former life in Manhattan, will use his influence in awarding a grant for the project. Barry Lindquist\u2019s Museum of Yankee Horrors is crowned the winner, but the celebration is short lived. The museum is vandalized overnight, and all of the exhibit mannequins have been dumped in an adjacent field. It is quite a shock when the body of one of the judges, Lucille Foster, is found a midst the detritus. Now time is of the essence to put things to right in time for the haunted house tours and before Jon comes to town to inspect the current community center, all while trying to get to the bottom of Lucille\u2019s death. Liv has gained a reputation about town as a problem solver, and it seems the entire town expects her to unmask the murderer. Hopefully, she can do so without losing their chance at the grant money as more and more motives and suspects, including Jon, surface.This is my first trip to Celebration Bay, but it will definitely not be my last. Even though I have not read the previous entries in the series, I had no trouble jumping right in with the characters and setting. I am a sucker for holiday themed cozy mysteries, especially those set during the autumn months. The town has a lot to offer its visitors, and this setting is perhaps the book\u2019s biggest draw. I would love to participate in the Zombie Walk and tour the haunted houses, all while enjoying the food and sundries that the local shops provide. There is even a witch newly arrived in town to add to the Halloween vibe.Liv is a practical, level headed protagonist who does not thoughtlessly place herself in the path of danger. Her friends, coworker, and landladies all seem to genuinely care for her. Their sometimes bumbling assistance provides some light moments throughout the story. I do wish, however, that they were more richly developed. I appreciate that the local law enforcement is treated with respect and not simply portrayed as inept investigators. Liv and Sheriff Bill have open exchanges of ideas and work together to solve the crimes. Many times in cozies the amateur sleuths have no real reason other than nosiness to ingratiate themselves in an investigation, but Liv has a vested interest in the outcome since it affects the town and her job. Whiskey, the Westie, is my favorite character. He brightens every scene he was in.As much as I like the setting and the basis for the characters, I think the mystery itself is a bit mundane and predictable. There are times when the story drags for lack of development. However, I do not think that this took away from my enjoyment of the book.Overall, I enjoyed Trick or Deceit. It is a frothy, entertaining trip to a quaint town. I recommend it to fans of holiday themed cozies."}, {"userName": "Debbie Lester", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2847613-debbie-lester", "userReview": "Shelley Freydont continues the Celebration Bay mystery series with her latest book, Trick or Deceit. Halloween is the perfect setting for murder! Readers who are looking for a great cozy for the fall season will love this one. With everything from haunted houses and witches to preachers and town skeletons in the closet, this book has it all. Freydont's trademark quirky characters and the small town setting give this one all the makings for one haunted read...What I liked:Halloween was always a favorite holiday of mine for more than one reason. Candy, candy and more candy, but more importantly getting to transform myself into a character from my favorite books. I took it seriously when it came to celebrating the season. I had a party once and even made my own graveyard with the names and funny epitaphs for my friends. So when I found out this cozy had a Halloween theme I was totally on board. Celebration Bay was the perfect place for this theme. This small town goes all out when it comes to holidays and I was excited to see how they decked out for the scariest of them all. The haunted house competition was a brilliant idea. I loved reading about the entries and how each person that entered interpreted it differently. The $10,000 prize certainly made things a little intense and somebody was a very sore loser. The mystery aspects of this one centered around the murder of one of the judges. Freydont gave readers plenty of suspects and the motive was pretty obvious, or was it? I thought the clues were plentiful and the red herrings were not too far out of the realm of possibility. Freydont did a great job with the Halloween theme and the murder mystery.Liv Montgomery, the heroine of the series and Celebration Bay's event coordinator is a perfect amateur sleuth. Celebration Bay is looking to get a grant to build a new community center and it's up to Liv to figure out the clues to this murder before a New York backer comes in. I liked that Liv is curious by nature but not necessarily foolhardy or reckless in her investigations. She is a pretty logical thinker and I like that about her. The other secondary characters in the book, add so much to each story. They are well written and always provide a different perspective on each mystery. Great characters all around. What I Didn't Like:There has been a lot of tension between Liv and Chaz for awhile now. They seem to be dragging their feet about whether or not they want to be a couple or not and that's getting a little frustrating, since this is Book 4 in the series. I want them to just pull the trigger so to speak, but that may just be a pet peeve of my own.Bottom Line:This was a good cozy for the season. Halloween is right around the corner and this one really hits the spot of those of us readers who like the creepy factor when it comes to murder. The mystery was believable and not to easy to figure out. The motive seems clear, but there are a lot of factors in this one. Liv is once again a great sleuth and seems to have settled into her role as event coordinator. She and Chaz need to figure it out though! LOL... A very good addition to the series!"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie", "userReview": "\"Trick or Deceit\" is a cozy mystery. You don't need to read the previous novels in the series to understand this one, and this one didn't spoil any previous whodunits.While this mystery had clues, it was not one where you could puzzle out whodunit based on timing and the physical evidence. There was no evidence/proof of whodunit until whodunit confessed. Knowing how cozy mysteries work, I had a good idea of whodunit and was correct. But I still prefer mysteries that are mental \"puzzle\" challenges.I was also disappointed in a subtle message in the story. A man tried to hit another man he felt had harmed him, and it was immediately broken up. But the occult shop owner's coven cast a spell on a man who was verbally harassing them which knocked the guy down. No one objected and the women were still considered \"light witches.\" Later, a woman slugged a male jerk, and people practically applauded. So...it's perfectly okay for women to hurt men, but it's bad when men hurt others? Hmm. Personally, I don't think violence is okay except when defending yourself or another against physical violence.There was no sex. There was some bad language.I received this book as a review copy."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6240796-christine", "userReview": "This series by Shelley Freydont is charming and has such a clever premise.

In this installment, it is Halloween season and the town has a contest to name the official town haunted house. The prize of $10,000 is awarded to Barry Lindquist for his Museum of Yankee Horrors. Ernie Bolton, second runner up, storms off after yelling that Barry bought the judges off. The next day Liv Montgomery, Celebration Bay's event coordinator finds the Museum vandalized and a body is discovered in the carnage of mannekins Liv has worked hard to bring the event to life and has a potential grant source coming for a visit. A murder is not one of the events she has planned. This was an OK book but it really seemed to drag along in places.

Celebration Bay in Upper New York State embraces and celebrates every major holiday drawing in thousands of cash spending tourists. Halloween is no exception with a Haunted House contest that has a $10,000 prize starting off the party. Dissatisfaction among the contestants ends with the murder of one of the judges. The town's event coordinator, Liv Montgomery, is pushing to solve this newest murder so that grant proposals for a new community center can proceed. The characters are like family and pull you into a very complex murder plot with a totally surprising ending. This has been an adventuresome series that only gets better. I really enjoy how the behind the scenes dramas of putting on a major celebration is presented. This blended with devious murder plots will give a fun night's reading that will make you impatient for the next book to come out."}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2930137-toni", "userReview": "I was really excited to read a Halloween cozy to get in the mood for the holiday but I had a hard time with this one. Maybe its because I just finished another cozy book in a different series that I really liked and so I compared them. Or maybe it's because I did not read previous books in this series but I felt very disinterested and had I not been reading this for a challenge I am in I would have not finished it. The premise sounded interesting to me initially--a haunted house contest--and a murder and a cute Westie dog named Whiskey. Many of the characters just annoyed me and I was not thrilled about the ending either. Anyway I wanted to love this book but unfortunately it fell flat for me."}, {"userName": "Georgiann Hennelly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1946881-georgiann-hennelly", "userReview": "Liv Montgomery is the event planner in Celebration Bay .
