They seem to be obsessed with conspicuous consumption, yet rather judgmental about others who are similar (ordering M&Ms in colors to match the office, while criticizing in-laws who want a big blowout wedding, etc.). It was funny to read how the sister who was marrying wanted a \"small\" wedding, while planning a bachelorette party which included renting an entire spa, \"ridiculous\" hotel suite, and 2 limos.Jodi (the main character) seems quite immature for her age and sadly dependent on men, while she trumpets how man-savvy she is.I find it hard to connect with her characters, which is a shame, because the author is clearly a very smart girl, and I really want to like her books.

I skimmed through it just to see how many times they would insult me. I am a WASP, I am a mother, and mother-in-law, and a grandmother. The description of the WASP future mother in law: \" She has a helmet of perfectly frosted hair, a slim figure, and the placid lack of expression that seems to come with BOTOX or Xanax or both\"...... \"Please do call me Grace,\" she says in a breathy, nasal voice that makes me wonder if the perfectly upturned button nose is original or a reproduction.\"  I am also a member of a country club and golf regularly. \"So what if you've always thought that golf was a white-elitist waste?\" Pick any ethnicity or religion, and paint a simplistic, totally stereotypical picture of them that matches this one, and the social justice warriors will run you out of town on a rail. But it's perfectly okay to do so for White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. They were equally condescending for religious people, conservatives, and people who value families. This while one of the characters was sleeping with three men at once. I do not think that our society has a whole has benefited from our move away from families and toward sexual abandon. I don't think it has freed women, I think it has just enslaved them in different ways. Children as well. I don't care if your family is headed by two women, two men, or a man a woman, I just ask that you at least try to form a stable family before having them, but she again dismisses \"family first\" people as being nuts. As you can probably tell by this rant, I am just tired of it. I am tired of condescending people who think they are tolerant writing absolutely intolerant garbage."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21389269-wendy", "userReview": "This wasn't well written and was predictable.

And what if you are wildly successful at it? Then in between broadcasting your weekly satellite radio talk show, writing your latest advice book and launching \"Spinster Sisters\" licensed merchandise in major retail outlets, you find yourself thinking about one particular guy? Since her divorce, Jodi Spingold has dated three or four different guys at a time, all while spending time socially with her trendy and highly regarded spinster aunts and working closely with her sister, Jill, on all aspects of their corporation, Spinster Inc. When Jill gets engaged to a wonderful man, the press jumps on the story and the sisters' many single fans turn bitter and disgruntled. The situation escalates when Jodi's ex-husband's horrid new fianc\u00e9e begins threatening to plant negative publicity in the press unless they pay her off. But for all of her many worries, Jodi is most concerned about Connor, the intriguing man she met at the grocery store while trying to buy the last bag of mini-marshmallows for her Thanksgiving sweet potatoes. She's specifically concerned with whether he will call, whether he likes her as much as she likes him and whether she needs to stay single in order to keep the corporation viable and profitable. From inside the minds of dating advice experts, Stacey Ballis creates a network of supportive sisters from their elderly aunts to their fortunate coworkers and all of their adoring fans. Practical and pointed advice, excerpted from Jodi and Jill's advice books, starts each new chapter to contrast the changes in their lives with the reality of their business. Ballis addresses the dilemmas of empowered, independent women who are proud of their single status, but also looking hopefully toward settling down with someone special with grace and eloquence. She asks the hard questions, like what gives our popular relationship experts their credibility, and can THE SPINSTER SISTERS continue to expand their woman-centered corporate empire if they loose their spinster status?"}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1332648-jenny", "userReview": "I thought this would be a funnier book, but instead it was quite predictable and blah. Jodi and Jill are sisters two years apart but as close as twin, even living in the same house above the apartment their two spinster aunts inhabit. Jodi is divorced and has two guys she's seeing part-time and Jill has just become engaged to Hunter (there should be a drinking game for every time Jodi notes how perfect Hunter is for Jill). Naturally, this book isn't just about Jodi's fear of alienating their supporters (called the Spinster Sisters) now that Jill is going to be married, but also about her new relationship with a guy named Connor as well (I did think that his picking her up in the food mart was cute).I gave up on the book for a couple reasons:1) I didn't really like Jodi... she has a 28-year-old boy toy that she isn't sleeping with and a 48-year-old Silver Fox who she is ... and then there is Connor to add to the mix. I'm 32, and maybe it's because I haven't lived through a divorce but I just couldn't take her seriously as a character. In fact, all the characters were very flat and stereotyped, in particular the aunts. 2) Speaking of Jodi, I didn't buy that a 34-year-old would go around saying \"bod\" in the same breath as the F-word (and there were many cases where the dialogue just didn't seem real, like Paige's rant against Jodi's ex's new girlfriend - it was too smart and long to be real.)3) the fact that everyone thought Jodi's lunch kit ideas were cute. I thought they seemed stupid and knick-knacky to me (she suggests they make a \"Spinster Sisters'\" lunch kit for listeners to enjoy using during their radio station lunch hour)Anyway, I thought Ballis would be funny and that a very vanilla book would be more enjoyable because of some laughs.

A spinster is a woman who has never been married. One sister had been divorced in this book. So the name is inaccurate from the start.Then I really disliked Jodi.

Between this and her aunts, she has been inspired to write about the single life. Jodi and Jill soon build an empire on the concept of a full life as a happily single woman. They have books and a radio show. They're doing quite well for themselves and while they're not exactly saying that they encourage staying single, a lot of their fans (and critics) see that as the takeaway. They do call themselves the spinster sisters after all.The book begins with Jill's engagement.She's very happy about it but Jodi sees the chance that her sister getting married could screw to the whole message of spinster sisters. She's happy for Jodi, but scared for their business.It doesn't take long before the critics join in, some fans are upset, didn't Spinster Sisters tell them it was better to be single they ask.Critics call them hypocrites.And during this time, Jodi is juggling three different men and some drama from an ex.I liked the characters and the style of writing.

This is the best word I could come up with to describe what I thought about this book. Just meh. It wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't great. It was just meh. A story about two sisters who run a conglomerate focused around empowering women to be true to themselves, the plot was predictable and fairly boring. The characters were likable enough, but pretty much a dime a dozen. Lots of use of the f-word, which made it stand out a little from other chick lit books. But I felt like maybe Ballis was over using profanity just for the shock factor because it didn't seem to fit in with the narrative. Every time one of the sisters said fuck I felt myself pulled out of the story and I am by no means a prissy type who never cusses. Fuck no. But it just seemed overdone. One of them even calls the other the c-word at one point (for some reason, I found myself unable to even type the real word. Weird, maybe I am a prissy type!).

Their main focus is the happiness and empowerment of women. Jodi is divorced, but Jill has just announced her engagement to Hunter. Hate mail and negative publicity ensue, and Jodi begins to worry that their empire will crash around them. Their two single aunts inspire them tremendously from the time they were little. Jodi and Jill's parents died in a car crash and from that point on Aunt Shirley and Aunt Ruth has been their foundation. It is an interesting story of the two sisters, Jill is devoted to her finance Hunter while Jodi dates like there is no tomorrow.

Some authors/people think cursing gives a sentence special effect, but I personally believe that girls should NOT frequently uses curse words. This is not a gender bias type of thing - I don't thing men should use curse words either, but it sounds MUCH worse coming out of the mouth of women.As for the rest of the book - it's basically a chick flick in a book!!! And there's much more soul to the book then \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 days\" and \"Failure to Launch,\" etc. I love the way that Stacey Ballis writes and she has a way of portraying women to be so intelligent and successful, but yet keeping them down to earth so every reader, regardless of their personal status can SOMEHOW relate to the characters.This book also encouraged me to start traditions in my new family and with my girlfriends - the best piece of advice from the book - stop pressuring men about Valentine's Day. Instead, start a new tradition with your best friends or your mother or your sister - and enjoy the day together doing girly things."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/220833-melanie", "userReview": "As I was reading this, I kept getting annoyed by the dialogue - there would be like a page and a half of articulate, well-thought-out speech for one character, then another would respond with a page and a half of the same. But the more I thought about it, the more I felt like maybe that was the way these characters talked (I'm pretty verbose myself sometimes) and that it's just hard to read in a book as dialogue. So I was torn on that part, whether it was unrealistic, or just didn't work pacing-wise. Either way, I liked the concept of the book - two sisters running a business focused on single women living their best lives, then one is getting married & the other has to reconcile with that and her own choices in life - and I liked a lot of the advice the sisters gave, even if it didn't always read beautifully. I didn't love the ending, but it was sort of inevitable.

Stacey Ballis has made it on to my favorite authors list! \"The Spinster Sisters\" is a book about 2 sisters, Jodi & Jill, and their relationship through the years. How it has changed and evolved all while the Spingold sisters are building a business together. The main plot driver being that one of the Spinster sisters gets engaged, thus no longer being a spinster...now what?! Ballis is a great story teller who shows the real side of being an independent woman. She sheds a light on the bullshit that women have to deal with in society today, mainly at the hands of other women, how they are quick to judge or criticize each other rather than supporting and encouraging one other.

About the time that I would get annoyed with the main character (long story short - if you aren't committed to a fella, don't expect him - or any of them, as was the case here - to be committed to you. I also found it hard to sympathize with the romantic loneliness of someone who had not one, not two, but three part-time boyfriends. Have an actual dry spell, and then you can share my ice cream. Also, actively choosing not to commit relinquishes your right to whine, \"What is it about me that makes men not want to shower me with undying devotion?\" That's easy - your unwillingness to do the same for them. /rant), one of the other characters would swoop in and save the day by saying to her EXACTLY what I was thinking.
