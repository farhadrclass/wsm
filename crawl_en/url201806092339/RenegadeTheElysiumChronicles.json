Right? Don't be fooled! The world inside Renegade is not pretty. It's not beautiful! It's gory, disturbing, sick, and the more you advance in the story, the more terrifying it all becomes. It starts innocently enough. Perfect life, in a perfect garden, everyone is \"perfect\" with perfect blue eyes and perfect blond hair, perfect genetics to make perfect babies in this perfect world full of perfect flowers and perfect fish--for real! They live in an underwater dome-- you get my gist. It's a utopia. At least until Evelyn realizes she's been forgetting things. Her memory is not what it should be, and neither is Mother. \n\"Failure will not be tolerated. The only result of failure is death-Enforcer Statute 104A.3\"\nMother... That's what she goes by in this world. She is, of course, the perfect leader. More like, the perfect villain. Like the world itself, the more we learn about Mother, the more perturbed you will feel. This woman has some twisted plans and has been working on sick, gruesome experiments that made my eyes widen in disgust--me: the lover of all things horror. It was not always from the gore either, although there is plenty of it, but also from a psychological perspective. Brainwashing, manipulation, memory alteration, all from an alarmingly young age; there is nothing this woman has not tried. It is all so disturbing in so many ways.\n\"\"Oh my God,\" Gavin says, and starts gagging.Even I can't blame him. The hallway is covered with dead bodies. The floor is sticky with partially dried pools of blood. The walls and even the ceiling are covered in sprays of blood. And it drips from the ceiling like sprinkles of rain.\"\nEvelyn is Daughter of The People; mother's best and brightest. This girl was chosen as Mother's daughter as she is the epitome of perfect. She will grow up to be the next perfect perfectness. It comes without saying, this girl did not evade Mother's maniacal engineering. What does this give us? A very broken, messed up protagonist! A girl who is stubborn and resilient, with a mind that has been so altered, that she, herself, is not sure what is true anymore. I found the psychological aspect of this character--this novel as a whole, really-- to be incredibly well done. Layer after layer we see the mental instability of not only Evie, but this whole sick \"utopia\". Evie shows us her amazing strength and determination, then in the blink of an eye, she turns into someone completely different with seemingly no control over her own thoughts and actions. Now she can't even trust herself! I love books that add in psychological twists, they both terrify and fascinate me, and Souders did this brilliantly. Some may consider the romance insta-love. I saw it more as a quick bond founded on this need to survive. Living through horrible life and death situations with another person forms unimaginable bonds, and this is what happens to Evie and Gavin. It's not the clich\u00e9 all-empowering-end-all love, but a sweet, believable romance that has quickly, but believably formed between two teenagers running for there lives together, keeping each other alive. And this escape is serious; Imperative. There is a LOT riding on it and will be the difference between a new life, or a life that is worse than death. The pace is set high with constant action, though not so much that it deprives us of character or world building. The horrors that we see along the way makes it even more electrifying; and what's worse, is it's all frighteningly real. Even the dome is described in such great scientific detail that it convinces of its plausibility. When we get to the ending, we see ourselves at the start of a new journey that will take part in book two. Oh, the wait will be a killer! Renegade is the kind of book where the more you read, the better it gets. So for a book that starts already uphill, by the time I was done, I was not only on top of the hill, but I had leaped over, and into an abyss of bloody muffins. Yes, it all comes down to the muffins!\"Way down yonder, down in the meadow,There's a poor wee little lamby.The bees and the butterflies pickin' at its eyes,The Poor wee thing cried for her mommy. -Children song, part of the pre-school curriculum\"--Quotes in this review were taken from an uncorrected proof.An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "shady boots | #20gayteen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4972138-shady-boots-20gayteen", "userReview": "This review is also available over at my blog.______________________Holy crap.Um, wow, I'm not even sure where to start.Okay, so, in the underwater city of Elysium, which is ruled by a woman that goes by Mother, Evelyn Winters has been trained to be the Daughter of the People, and the one in line to be the leader of the city. She had a perfect life, loved by Mother and all the citizens of Elysium. But when Gavin Hunter, a Surface Dweller, somehow manages to enter the city, Evie starts realizing that her whole life is a lie. Her memories are constantly altered and her mind not under her own control, and the city's beloved Mother is a monster. As Evie and Gavin form a bond together, they plan an escape to the surface. But Mother has many terrifying secrets, including one that could destroy everything.I loved how this was written. I liked that during the first few chapters, there were ones that started exactly the same, with sentences like My life is just about perfect and It's nice to have someone to talk to and so on. You could definitely tell when Evie was mind-controlled or not. The whole mind-control thing overall was a very nice touch with Evie, because during the last half of the book, it caused a lot of crazy shit to go down. Actually, something hella crazy happens at the end of the first chapter, so that's pretty much a warning about how intense the book is gonna be.Evie was likable. When she was in control of her own mind, of course. She didn't make any stupid choices, and she was definitely far from a Mary Sue. Starting the book, I actually was expecting her to be a Mary Sue. Imagine my surprise when she turned out a pretty borderline-kickass heroine. Especially nearing the end. Holy shite. My jaw went straight through the floor and into the ground several times.I also quite liked Gavin. He has a southern accent, which I rarely see YA heroes have. xD And I thought he was pretty sweet and never came off as a douche. The romance between him and Evie was unfortunately insta-love, but, get this: I was not annoyed with it whatsoever. I know, right? What sorcery is this? Insta-love has always been a one-way ticket to a low rating for me, but this time the book was just so damn awesome that it made me overlook the insta-love. And to be honest, I really liked their chemistry.Mother. Okay, this bitch is straight-up batshit insane. Seriously. She's way past the point of drunk with power. She's so obsessed with wanting her city to be completely flaw-free that she would do anything to ensure that. And by anything, I really do mean anything. Double, triple, quadruple emphasis if needed. Besides Mother, there's also Father, but he was pretty much just a shadow. He only appears, like, once in the whole book, and had about one or two lines. I felt like he was the King from Alice in Wonderland: barely there, completely passive and letting his woman take care of everything.I liked the world-building, and the whole Enforcer thing I thought was very...unusual. They're females that are selected from the age of three to become these assassin-type murderers that serve Mother. It was crazy that all of them were these really young girls, most of them barely sixteen. I give props to the author for that whole concept, because I think it's pretty damn original. Although I did feel like the details of how Elysium came about were very brief and sort of vague. And I also kept wondering what it was like in the surface. Was it like our modern world? Or was it completely torn apart by wars, as Mother wants the citizens of Elysium to believe? There weren't any details about it, really, besides the quotes at the beginning of each chapter (which are all from Mother's words so that's why I'm skeptical) but I'll let it slide because this is the first book, and I know there will be more info in the next one.Around 250 or so pages, I started getting into this book so damn much. The amount of action was overwhelming, and all the scenes were very gripping and intense. I was so into it that I swear I was panting as I read. I was ready to give the book 4 or 4.5 stars, until the last half. I thought if I rated this book any less than 5 stars it would be a friggin' crime punishable by law.I'm glad that the ending wasn't quite a huge cliffhanger, or I would've been pissed the hell off. I am extremely excited to see where this series goes, because there are countless unanswered questions swirling in my head right now.To put it shortly, this book was pretty damn awesome, despite its few flaws. Hell, the simple fact that the insta-love in it didn't annoy me at all just proves how awesome it is. I would recommend you get your hands on this book as soon as possible.Billions of thank you's to NetGalley and Tor for sending me this galley!"}, {"userName": "TheBookSmugglers", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1223249-thebooksmugglers", "userReview": "Originally reviewed on The Book SmugglersSixteen-year-old Evelyn Winters' life is just about perfect. Adopted by Mother and made the Daughter of the People, Evelyn is being groomed for the inevitable day that she will take over Mother's illustrious position as the head of the suboceanic society of Elysium. The war and strife of the hateful Surface Dwellers above led Mother to start a new society of her own, concealed by the ocean's murky depths. It is Evelyn's job to listen to the people, to learn from Mother, and most pressingly, to select a mate with whom she will Couple - from the predetermined pool of matches that Mother has authorized, of course.When a surface dweller makes his way into Elysium, however, everything Evelyn has ever known changes. Gavin - the young, handsome, and impossible Surface Dweller - causes Evelyn to question her society, her own mind, and Mother. As she grows closer to Gavin and decides to help him escape Elysium, she uncovers devastating revelations about Elysium's past, Mother's true nature, and Evelyn's own clouded, brainwashed past.I was drawn to Renegade because of the killer premise for the book - I love a suboceanic SF tale, and I love dystopian societies with unreliable narrators even more. When I started Renegade, it truly seemed that the book would deliver on this incredibly promising premise - it has a cool sort of Bioshock-ish vibe, combined with a distinct sense of foreboding creepiness, as Renegade's heroine is completely unsuspecting that her actions and thoughts are so bizarre. Evelyn's brainwashed, repetitive thoughts and the little pieces of information she lets slip about her daily life are unsettling and effective in painting a picture of a deep-seated wrongness in Elysium. So, yes, Renegade starts with an undeniable bang. That said, while the first chapters are solid, the book quickly devolves into a puddle of tepid ridiculousness: Renegade is a classic case of great idea, terrible execution. A poorly conceived world that is blandly written with a nonexistent plot and laughable characterizations, Renegade is not a good book. Let's start with the (nonexistent) plot. From the description and the first few chapters, you'd think the book will be a girl's journey to uncover the secrets of her past and come to terms with the conditioning and brainwashing she has had to endure for years. It isn't. Essentially, the plot of Renegade involves Evelyn and Gavin running around Elysium for the entire book, desperately looking for escape exits and dodging DNA-scanning guns (it's ok because apparently Elysium has no shortage of \"shadows\" in which Evelyn and Gavin can hide from guards and gun turrets). While fast-paced, the lack of actual meat and emotional integrity to the story is deeply disappointing. Instead of character development and realistic motivations for character decisions and action, we get slipshod worldbuilding (replete with ludicrous technology - more on that in a bit), people that are EVIL for EVIL's sake, some good old fashioned insta-love, and a dystopian society that inherently makes no sense. In Elysium, Mother has declared that only blonde, blue eyed, light-skinned people fit her perfect race. The rationale behind the genetic tinkering and Aryan-esque standard for genetic perfection is never satisfactorily explained, however (which is actually incredibly troubling when you think about it). Nor is it explained HOW exactly Mother had her rise to power. She's been in power for 30 years, yet generationally this does not account for the older people in the society, and it does not jive with the \"gene manipulation\" that Mother has implemented for all of her Citizens (e.g. there are older people in this society that are middle aged or the same age as Mother - how, exactly do they fit in with her Perfect Blonde/Blue-Eyed World?). Unless Mother brainwashed every single person on a regular basis, unless every single person that was initially invited to Elysium back when it was a vacation resort was blonde, blue-eyed and white skinned (or there were a sufficient number of blonde blue-eyed white skinned people around that Mother could create a society with them after disposing of all the dark haired/skinned/other colored eyed people)?* The character of Mother herself is comical, portrayed as both unstable (there's a scene where she melodramatically whispers \"Why does everyone leave me?\" to an old photograph of her dead mother before smashing all of her precious perfume bottles in an insane rage), and an Evil Mastermind Dictator that has unlimited resources and loyalty from her police force and guards.** It's incredibly hard to take Mother seriously as a character because of this skimpy motivation and characterization. Why does Mother do the things she does? Essentially, the reason comes down to this: Mother is Evil and Insane and harbors some unexplained prejudice against Surface Dwellers (and people with dark skin/dark hair/non-blue eyes). After Evelyn discovers Mother's Super Secret Diary, she concludes:[Mother] grew to hate free will. She believed she had a pure vision of a perfect society - a perfect family - but the Citizens did not comply. She saw the city falling apart before her eyes. The harder she worked to bring her vision to the city, the more the people rebelled against her rules. She wanted them to be more docile so she worked with a scientist to experiment with gene manipulation.And with that brilliant observation, Mother's character is explained away by Evelyn. Case closed! She grew to hate free will! That explains everything!Beyond Mother's characterization, there is the utter ridiculousness of the science and technology in this world. I can accept that a suboceanic society has some fast and loose science at the helm, harvesting power from oceanic volcanoes and nanobots to prevent the bends - that's fine. I can swallow that. BUT, the ridiculousness of the computing systems/Elysium's technology and Evelyn's magical skills to crack said systems are laughable. Such gems include Evelyn's deductive skills:Then I reach another section in code. I can't make out much, but the dates correspond with the journal from Sector One. Finally, I find a blue hyperlink within the code and I know I have to see where it leads. And Evelyn's supreme (and utterly convenient) hacking skills:The computer immediately asks for a password. At fist I panic [...] But still, I barely breathe while I fight the computer. My fingers fly over the holographic keyboard ad my arm aches like a bad tooth, but I don't dare stop. Even though I've never done this before, it's like the codes an sequences are all there in my mind just waiting for me to use them. Somehow I know how to peel down each wall of security as if it is an orange [...] with every step I take forward to break the code, the more concerned I am the computer will tell Mother what I'm doing. Finally, just as another drop of sweat dribbles down my back, the desktop appears on the holoscreen. I cracked the password.And to cover her mad computer prodigy skills, there's this kicker:\"If Mother was able to see that you fixed Macie's coupling thing, wouldn't she have just removed us from the computer again?\"I give him a thin smile. \"No. I made it 'read-only.'\"Seriously. No, SERIOUSLY.But there's more! Beyond the ludicrous computer information technology, more importantly there are fantastically convenient devices and nuggets to bail Evelyn and Gavin out of trouble, and also to cause drama to make sure they don't make it to the ever-illusive exits too quickly. There are conveniently left behind and perfectly preserved notebooks detailing Mother's past (from both Mother's perspective, and that of her unfortunate father), and there are caches of weapons from decades earlier that were never removed or discovered in a secretly preserved older sector in Elysium that Evelyn and Gavin just happen to stumble upon. There's the deus ex machina factor, too - the (incredibly beautiful, genetically perfect) Evelyn is able to: kick ass because of her Super Secret Past Training. She has secret undiscovered knowledge of weapons and computer systems; she was the youngest enforcer to ever excel at all the things in the world. In order to throw a wrench in this perfect person's path, there's a magical failsafe that kicks in \"when she tries to help a Surface Dweller escape\" (because...that's something you'd program for in your suboceanic society in which there are no Surface Dwellers?) - how does this work? WHEN does it work? Why does it only kick in at the eleventh hour? Needless to say, the gaps in logic here are insurmountable. And this is just ONE example of the crazy lack of internal logic in Renegade.***Then, there's the issue of the inconsistent world - Evelyn doesn't know the meaning of slang like \"hot\" and touching is outlawed, but \"sexy\" is a normal word, stiletto leather boots are around? No livestock are present underwater because the space and resources they consume, but she knows about other animals from the surface? At the end of the book - when the equivalent of 28 Days Later genetically modified/experimental ZOMBIES show up (I shit you not) to throw yet another roadblock in our intrepid couple's attempts to escape, the following common popular song is being sung:There's a poor wee little lamby...The bees and the butterflies picking at its eyes.Praytell, HOW would this underwater society, whose every move and piece of literature and knowledge has been carefully sanitized, where everyone is a vegetarian because livestock takes up too much room, know what bees and butterflies and lambs are? And then, of course, there's the problem of the insta-romance - Gavin and Evelyn know each other for, oh, 3-4 days, and Evelyn is willing to throw away everything she has worked for as Daughter of the People, and she can miraculously overcome the ingrained conditioning and brainwashing that has dominated her life since she was a child. Needless to say, things feel a little rushed, and the character development is stunningly unconvincing. Compounding the problem is Souders' writing, which ranges from blandly competent to intensely annoying - stomach flutters, breath catches, and phrases like \"I lose myself along with my breath and my heart\" abound.There's also the problem that Evelyn and her friends are so very ridiculously STUPID and slow to put together the pieces (e.g. when friends start acting strangely and issuing weird canned responses - He's a Filthy SURFACE DWELLER! You are Silly Flighty Girl! - the thought of brainwashing never crosses her mind). I could keep going on. I really could. But I think you get the picture. So far as Renegade is concerned, there's only one word that comes to mind to embody my dissatisfaction with the book. Just NO.--------------*It's also worth mentioning that in this dystopian society, people are all apparently heterosexual and expected to Couple with someone from the opposite gender - a problem pervasive in so many YA SF dystopias, rearing its ugly head here.**Again, how did she win this loyalty? HOW does Elysium actually run, when it seems that Mother has killed all the scientists and she herself has grown up underwater for most of her life without - apparently - any education in the sciences?***Another key question: the motivation to keep Evelyn alive, according to Mother, is that she needs Evelyn to procreate with another perfect genetic match to pass on her AMAZING genes - but in a society in which genetic tinkering is supposedly commonplace, WHY put up with the drama and hassle of keeping Evelyn around and alive? Why not, I don't know, artificially inseminate her eggs with ideal sperm in a laboratory environment?"}, {"userName": "Kendra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4901709-kendra", "userReview": "As Daughter of the People, Evie Winters\u2019 life is just about perfect. Chosen as a child for her perfect genetic profile, she was adopted and raised by Mother and is being groomed to one day take her place as leader of the underwater society Elysium. But not everything is as it seems, and something is wrong in Evie\u2019s practically perfect life. She finds herself missing chunks of time, and experiences splitting headaches accompanied by flashes of forgotten memories. When Surface Dweller Gavin crashes into Evie\u2019s garden one day, she is drawn to him, and they soon find themselves on the run from Mother and her terrifying Enforcers, searching for a way to return Gavin to land, and recover Evie\u2019s clouded past.Renegade takes an intriguing premise and unfortunately turns it stale. The protagonist Evie starts as a fascinating and troubled character. As the book is written in present tense, we are able to see the depth of Evie\u2019s brainwashing, and the reasons behind her eerie repetitive thoughts. Unfortunately, once she starts putting the pieces of her situation together, the novel loses most of its suspense and originality to become a predictable action story.The biggest loss is the potential for Evie\u2019s character arc. She begins cowed, brainwashed, and manipulated into believing unquestioningly the lies of the society, but makes an almost immediate switch to kick-ass, confident heroine. For a character that has sustained years of emotional isolation, memory wipes, and encoding, she shows no sign of internal struggle, or damage. While there is a predictable back-story to help explain this, I found the ease and speed of her emotional transformation to be unrealistic, as well as a wasted opportunity for complex characterization. For instance, in Elyrian society there is an emphasis on modesty of behavior and dress, with severe punishments for infringements. Initially, Evie spends quite a bit of time making sure her skirt is covering her knees, and avoiding looking men in the eye. Yet a couple chapters later, she\u2019s sashaying around in a negligee, and flirting with guards as a ploy to distract them.Like Evie, her love interest Gavin also seems undercooked. He\u2019s attractive, he has a Southern accent, and he occasionally challenges her assumptions. The best thing about his character, unfortunately rare, is that he is neither controlling nor rape-y. While there are instances where Evie thinks he might be jealous of the man Mother has chosen to Couple with her, he doesn\u2019t say anything, or try to stop her from going through with it. Hallelujah! His concern for her is that she isn\u2019t able to make her own decisions. Similarly, I appreciated that Evie had started to figure things out before Gavin, and that her life did not start when the guy showed up.While the characters were generally bland, much of the world building actively did not make sense. This underwater society was built to escape the hate and violence of the surface world, and only the best (read: blond, blue-eyed, pale) were allowed to join. There are strict genetic tests to determine whether two people will be allowed to Couple, as well as moral laws about touching before being paired. However, for a society with these extreme dystopian elements, much of the book reads like it takes place in current day North America. Evie casually orders a chai soy latte after one of her Citizens is dragged away to be executed, and observes a sushi restaurant while walking downtown. \tGavin\u2019s world, on the other hand, resembled the Old West. His town has a Sherriff, he hunts to trade for cloth and oil for lanterns, but later makes reference to watching horror movies. This limited supply of electricity would presumably have gone to something more useful than a movie theater, especially since it was mentioned in such an offhanded way, not as if it were some unusual and special event. \tSimilarly, there are no animals in Elysium, with all protein coming either from fish or plants, and Evie is shocked to find that Gavin hunts for sport. Yet later she casually refers to her \u2018leather stiletto boots\u2019. First of all, in this society that prizes public modestly, where is the market for this kind of footwear, and second of all where did the leather come from?? \tMy final observation is the conspicuous use of the metric system in what is presumably a former American society (no specific reference to the US is made, except that they are just off the coast in the Atlantic of a North American country, in tropical waters). This would could have been an interesting aspect to address with the political climate changing during the surface wars, but it was never explained and just felt like a detail that was thrown in as \u2018look, things are different!\u2019. The best word to describe this book is bland. And that\u2019s saying something for a book that revolves around genetic perfection. The impetus behind selecting blond, blue-eyed, white people is never really explained. Clearly the person in charge is CRAZY and EVIL, but what was the motive behind this kind of selection? In a future where DNA cameras exist, what scientific evidence do they come up with for appearance to be genetically \u2018superior\u2019 than the others? Especially with actual science demonstrating that a diverse genetic profile makes for healthier individuals. The best that can be said is that Souders deals inoffensively with offensive topics, but it also means that nothing is really said or addressed by it other than it\u2019s BAD.The plot was rather familiar and predictable. It is far more action/chase oriented than I was expecting, and much of the plotting did not make sense. If Evie is being trained to take over as the head of the society, why are they constantly erasing her memory? Wouldn\u2019t they be turning her to their side, not keeping her completely in the dark? How can she rule if she is basically non-functional, wouldn\u2019t they just have tried again with someone else?The inconsistencies in world building, and un-intriguing plotlines weigh down a book already all too familiar and weak. If you\u2019re looking for a book that addresses mind manipulation, I suggest checking out A Long, Long Sleep and The Adoration of Jenna Fox."}, {"userName": "Keertana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7584700-keertana", "userReview": "Rating: 4.5 Stars Wow. I honestly don\u2019t know where to start when it comes to Renegade. While I was excited beyond measure to first read the synopsis of this novel, and even later when it\u2019s beautiful (and very relevant) cover released, I found myself dreading the moment it would arrive for me in the mail as, with each passing day, I became convinced that Renegade would be \u201cjust another\u201d dystopian novel with insta-love, predictability, and downright flat characters. Well, let me reassure you now: Renegade is not \u201cjust another\u201d dystopian novel. Although its premises mirrors that of other utopias, only underwater, Renegade is the rare example of that typical dystopian plot done right and believe me, it is spectacular.Elysium is an underwater utopia, ruled by a woman who calls herself Mother. Evie, the adopted daughter of Mother, has been hand-picked for her set of perfect genes and is the Daughter of the People, training to become the next Mother. Evie\u2019s life is just about perfect, but her world is turned upside down with the arrival of Gavin, a Surface Dweller. Gavin, unknowingly having found an entrance into Elysium, is held as a prisoner in the underwater utopia Mother built away from the wars, famine, and pain that regales the lives of those living above. Upon interrogating Gavin though, Evie slowly begins to realize that not only is everything Mother said about the Surface false, so is everything else about her life: Evie has been brainwashed time and time again, conditioned only to remember what Mother wants her to remember. With this newfound knowledge, Evie sets out to help Gavin escape, but unknown to them all is that Mother still has plenty of deadly cards up her sleeve\u2026I really have to hand it to Souders \u2013 the woman knows how to write. Renegade opens up by introducing us to the extent of Evie\u2019s brainwashing, even from page one. We can see that Evie thinks the thoughts she\u2019s meant to think and whenever she\u2019s just beginning to break free of that mold, her memories are wiped out. It\u2019s all rather horrifying and the glimpses of the real Evie we get to witness in-between her conditioning only make us admire her resilience, strength, and loyalty. Thus, I really liked Evie; she was everything I look for in a protagonist and her story kept me flipping the pages, frantically needing to know what happened next. Evie aside, I loved the world Souders had created. Not only is Elysium beautiful, but the world-building surrounding it is richly detailed and complete. Souders slowly peels back the layers surrounding this mysterious realm, from its creation, to the inner workings of its independence from the Surface, to the madness that drives its ruler, Mother, to brainwash the members of her land. Yet, what impressed me most of all was that Souders approached her utopia with a new kind of cunning. In the majority of dystopian novels, we are given a faulty utopian society and eventually, the citizens come to realize this and they rebel. In Renegade, however, Mother knows that her citizens will rebel \u2013 which is exactly why she brainwashes them and uses genetic manipulation to get her way. It\u2019s all eerily haunting and remarkably cunning at the same time, making Mother a villain to fear. Nevertheless, despite my enjoyment of this novel, I did have one slight qualm with Renegade: the romance. I\u2019ve heard the romance in Renegade be called insta-love, but it isn\u2019t. Gavin and Evie meet quite by accident and with time, they become friends. Evie is the only person Gavin can trust in the strange realm he\u2019s found himself in and to Evie, Gavin is the one person who seems to truly know what\u2019s happening and help her remember when her brain resorts back to its conditioning. From the moment these two escape though, their friendship turns into romance and I wasn\u2019t really feeling it. I loved Evie as a character on her own and Gavin is a really nice guy, but I never felt as invested in their love story as I wanted to be, perhaps because Gavin could, at times, be extremely cheesy and almost unrealistically male. I have to admit though that I was overjoyed by the ending of this story, which made me realize that while Gavin and Evie\u2019s romance didn\u2019t do much for me for the duration of the action and fast-paced adventure that graced this tale, I ultimately still did really like them as a couple, even if it was only by the very end. Frankly speaking, Renegade is a novel I might have skipped over if I hadn\u2019t received an ARC, so I\u2019m warning you all now: this is not a book you want to miss out on. Souders creates a deadly utopia, part dystopian and part psychological thriller, which is bound to keep your eyes glued to the page. Furthermore, her characters are well fleshed-out, her romance is realistic, her world-building is absolutely, and her villain deserves a hearty round of applause for her evil schemes. J.A. Souders is a debut author I will be eagerly watching out for in the future and I am already counting down the days until the sequel to Renegade releases. If the first novel was this could, can you imagine how mind-blowing the next installment will be? ;)I was given a copy of this book from the publisher on behalf of DAC ARC Tours in exchange for a honest review.

Her Mother rules all, and she\u2019s a queen that rules with an iron fist. When Evelyn\u2019s memory flashes pop up in her mind\u2019s eye, it causes her to question her perfect utopia. Even more so when a surface dweller somehow stumbles upon their city in the water and starts to tell her the truth of what happened back on land.Evie didn\u2019t exactly pick up on her trashed memories until it started happening more frequently which I found bored to read with. It kept happening and replaying again and I found it boring and tiresome. I felt no connection with Evie whatsoever, minus the fact that the plot kept me so entertained.Mother reminds me of a woman Hitler. She\u2019s downright tyrannical, leads her people with an iron fist, and is more crazy with the idea of perfection than you have ever seen in a character. Naturally she ends up being the most interesting character. As the story progresses, the history of how she came to be is revealed. And thank God there were answers. Nothing annoys me more than a book that leaves all the questions unanswered.The romance was downright abysmal and I\u2019m always a sucker for romantic relationships in novels. I even enjoy love triangles, but this one fell short. It had a lot of potential to be a great book but it was sorely lacking. Not to the writing style itself, but to their character personalities. It\u2019s always such a sucker punch to the gut when you can\u2019t connect with the characters you read. *sighs*CharactersEvie does grow a lot during the story, so that was a big plus.PacingIncredibly fast paced in the beginning, a tad still in the middle, and huge climatic ending. Wonderfully done.Cover & DesignBrilliant. Love the colours and the type suits the book well, but I felt the girl on the character to be too CG\u2019d.PlotIncredibly woven with a twist or two here and there which made it fun to keep reading.Lots of potential, and I wished I liked the characters more."}, {"userName": "Ria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4400254-ria", "userReview": "Ugh, any enjoyment I may have had for the book's (somewhat interesting) plot (but made clumsy by all too convenient coincidences), was COMPLETELY ruined by the fact that this book DIRECTLY perpetuates the pernicious LIE that the \"perfect\" human can only be white, blonde, and pale. There may or may not have been an indirect hinting of racial cleansing in Elysium (because don't expect me to believe the utter tripe that only white people are rich), but there is no denouncing of said racial cleansing (which just bloody perpetuates racism! Aside from the whole \"white is the perfect default\" thing, we get no explanation of the ~war on earth, devastating, cruel WW3-esque tragedy~. If not for the egregious racial agenda, I probably would have given this 2 stars (for the interesting premise because I've been waiting for a novel set under the sea), but not so much for the sloppy writing (and the really awkwardly misplaced sexual tension/advances)).

From the very beginning, you can tell all is not right in this underwater 'utopia', but you can't imagine the full extent of control and insanity that Mother has inside her little head. The main character, Evie, is made to forget things almost daily, so this was a little confusing in the beginning because it's told from her POV, so you're like 'what is going on?'. The romance was cute, but kind of builds out of thin air. Evie just feels these intense feelings for the surface dweller, Gavin, for no apparent reason. But they grow to trust and depend on one another and refuse to leave the other behind. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because the twist was just kind of blah for me. Instead of an 'oh my gosh!!' reaction, I was like 'umm oooooo.....kay.', but still an interesting read."}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746727-arlene", "userReview": "My life is just about perfect\u2026Creepiest words EVER for the rest of my life!! Holy oceans of freaky fish!! This book was really good and mentally taxing all in one nightmare! I was not expecting to be this drawn into a dystopic YA thriller! But, J.A. Souders grabbed my attention and toyed with my imagination to the point where I just allowed myself to be pulled by the intensity and momentum of this story. The high energy and constant action of Renegade continued to build as the novel progressed. By the end of the book\u2026 I was spent!!In Renegade, we meet Evelyn Winters who is Elysium\u2019s Daughter of the People. She\u2019s being groomed to take over the rule of this underwater world that was built during the Surface War. Elysium is self-sustaining and the people of this community hold one thing sacred. The do not allow \u2018surf dwellers\u2019 to enter their perfect community made up of perfect humans. Surf dwellers are looked at as evil and destructive, so when Gavin finds his way from the surface into Evelyn\u2019s garden and is targeted for immediate elimination, she comes to his aid in order to help him escape.Each chapter commences with a chilling revelation of this underwater world that is controlled by \u201cMother.\u201d She\u2019s the supreme ruler of Elysium and her sole focus is to control the citizens through any means necessary, including destructive conditioning, cruel elimination of people and bio-manipulation. As Evelyn fights to help Gavin escape, she slowly uncovers the lengths to which \u201cMother\u201d has gone to control Elysium.This is a great story\u2026 no doubt. It was creative, creepy and captivating. Everything I typically require to rate a book as flawless. However, I did find a few elements that sort of caught my attention and made me consider a few things. For example, I\u2019m curious how readers will react to the characteristics that are used to describe the \u201cperfect human\u201d in Elysium. Some readers might be put off by the stereotypical \u201cblond hair\u201d and \u201cblue eyes\u201d as being the ideal human, so I wonder if that will create a negative reaction for some. However, I wasn\u2019t put off too much by it because it\u2019s this same group of people that are manipulated and conditioned to act against their will, so the balance between ideal and flawed is somewhat leveled in my opinion.In addition, I wanted to know more about the world building, including the war that occurred among the \u201cSurface Dwellers.\u201d It didn\u2019t feel post apocalyptic, but at the same time we weren\u2019t given enough information to determine if the world at the surface was destroyed to any capacity, so it left me slightly curious if anything.More importantly, it did take an ample amount of reality suspension to grasp the concept of an underwater world that\u2019s completely self-sufficient. It was captivating, but rather light on the details as to how that was all developed. As far as the characters go, I really liked Evelyn\u2019s (Evie) instincts and constant battle to fight her conditioning. As the story progressed and her delicate hold on reality was challenged, I was left at the edge of my seat to see how and if she\u2019d completely fall apart. It was eerie if anything to hear the mental battle going on in Evelyn\u2019s head. Her Mother is one twisted lollipop double dipped in psycho! Talk about the epitome of evil! I feel Gavin was the perfect pair for Evelyn. Where some might feel their immediate attraction and loyalty to each other was rather abrupt, it\u2019s important to consider their dire circumstance and complete reliance on one another to survive. Overall, I sort of bought into their connection for each other, so I was rooting for them the whole way through.Lastly, I wish Souders would have positioned this book as a stand-alone rather than shelf it with the overwhelmingly large number of trilogies that at this point is simply overwhelming. I was taken on a roller coaster of a ride that left me satisfied with the conclusion. With a few loose ends, I can close this adventure with my own imagination. It was an extremely satisfying dystopic thriller that I\u2019m sure YA readers will highly enjoy! Great book!"}, {"userName": "Ezmirelda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3800177-ezmirelda", "userReview": "Guys, this book blew my mind away...seriouslyFrom the beautiful utopian underwater setting of Elysium, to the deliciously sweet romance, the got-to-love-them characters, and the heart-pounding escape\u2014what\u2019s not to love about RENEGADE? It is rare that I find a book that is able to keep me so entertained and invested in the story. Guys, seriously, don\u2019t let the cover fool you\u2014Renegade is not just a gorgeous cover. It has a beautiful, action-packed, kick-butt storyline to match.Utopias, claustrophobia, and brainwashing, oh my!Reading Renegade gave me my first real case of readers-claustrophobia. While Evelyn didn\u2019t seem to mind her underwater utopian home of Elysium I constantly kept getting the chills thinking what life would be like if I never got to see real sunlight again. The setting and world-building is what did it for this book. The technology, the way the society works, and the explanation of how the heck a society of people can survive underwater was pretty darn fascinating. I loved Evelyn\u2019s character, especially toward the end as she began to get back some of her old memories and she became this awesome kick-butt heroine as opposed to the fragile meek brain-washed girl we meet in the first few chapters of the book.Romance, and my overall thoughts on the book...Words cannot express how adorably sweet Gavin and Evelyn\u2019s relationship is. Seriously, I awwed! for like half the novel. Although it may look it at first I didn\u2019t feel like there was any insta-love. It genuinely felt like Evie and Gavin grew to like each other gradually, and for the right reasons. Not just, hey I think you\u2019re hot. I think a great deal of Evie\u2019s initial attraction to Gavin was brought on with her fascination with everything to do with the surface, and because she liked learning about the surface so much that sparked a lot of their conversations in the beginning.In a nut shell, Renegade is a tantalizing debut novel worthy of re-reads. I seriously can\u2019t wait to read future books in the series!Confusions with Renegade:What happened to Evelyn\u2019s \u201cfather\u201d toward the end? He all of a sudden just disappeared in the middle of the book. His only purpose seems to be giving Evie the necklace which unlocks a few of her memories, but after that he practically vanishes. He didn\u2019t seem like he was brainwashed like the others, or that he was particularly approving of Mother\u2019s way of ruling Elysium.

There's nothing either of us can do about it, so I need you to just do it.\"I'm not going to tell you what the thing is that's going to hurt, but trust me, she's pretty badass. I started off this book bored, not really expecting too much from the over the top sweet cover \u2013 despite having a pretty kickass blurb. Have I ever been so wrong? The first chapter, the first chapter met my terrible expectations, but please please read to the second. What the author does is so clever, and honestly quite impressed me (although I was reading this late at night). Just read the first two chapters before you make up your mind, because I guarantee this book will mess you up.Theres this whole idea that looks can be deceiving, even carried out with the cover that like I said earlier, looks super sweet. The actual book is terrifying, full of dead bodies and even deader minds. If you take some time to think about it, the whole premise is seriously disturbing, even more so than places like Panem (the hunger games) in my opinion. Okay, maybe that wasn't a good example because it's become so mainstream, thus losing a lot of the horror. Um, maybe think gone girl? Evie's mother is worse than that. Despite all of the chilling experiments and other going ons, Souders still manages to make the characters realistic. \"I can see up your dress, okay? It's distracting.\"I do admit, that this kind of dialogue isn't something I actively look for in books, but let's be real here. I know all the other books go on and on about perfect guys with perfect manners and even more perfect bodies, but they're teenagers, so that's probably the most unrealistic part of the book (this applies to the girls as well btw. especially those 'special snowflakes'). I thought this realism kind of added to the horror of it all? It made us remember they're 16, alone and terrified. There were a couple of things that bugged me, the ending got a bit confusing and almost changed genres for a little bit? Also, there was barely any diversity (I know that most of the people are meant to look the same, but what about the surface dweller? At least make him a little more different... Anyway, I spent the whole book imagining the Evie having dark skin and black hair. Sorry not sorry).

Hello Little Mermaid, where is King Triton. That is exactly the impression I got, I even went back to Goodreads to read the synopsis again just to make sure this was not an alternative version of the Disney fairy tale. Once you get past the first couple chapters though it is nothing like what I was expecting. This is an amazing action packed story with twists and turns at every angle. This is definitely not the typical dystopian type of novel; it was a unique and intriguing story.Evelyn was resilient against all odds; think of a Katniss character in Hunger Games. Her \u2018Mother\u2019 was trying to create the perfect world in Elysium and used any means necessary to ensure her world was how she wanted it to be. Despite this fact Evelyn maintained a strong will and pure heart to overcome manipulation and make her own choices about right and wrong. She was constantly thinking of ways to get beyond the many changing obstacles that faced her and thought of only protecting the ones that she loved. Gavin was a great hero, using his own instincts to guide him through and make the right decisions about whether or not to trust Evelyn. He was good on his word and a protector at heart. I loved him throughout the book and he grabbed my heart right away.Overall, the author created a fascinating world that characters had to live in. The time frame was not exactly clear so the story is able to fit in any future time. The plot gives off a great lesson of right and wrong and standing for what you believe in and not just going with the flow.Note: I received this book from Netgalley.Also on http://lrjohnson13.blogspot.com/2012/...

I\u2019ve been totally glad when I\u2019ve got the book and also after the first shock, I\u2019ve liked it really much. Why a shock? The first pages were written very easy, the statements and thoughts of the central figure Evelin, or briefly called Evie, were childish and very irritating, because they sounded like rehearsed texts and they\u2019ve also confused me, to be honest. I already thought \u201aoh no\u2019 \u2013 what is this for a weird person and the book probably won\u2019t be right for me. Moreover I had the feeling to be stucked in the movie \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 and I was already expecting the worst.But there I have judged a little too rash, because Evie has entirely changed and transformed and then her \u201atrue-self\u2019 appeared and there is also a reason for her first weird behavior and thinking, which got explained and solved throughout the story.Of course at this point you ask yourself what has happened to start this abrupt change, in a society which lives completely isolated and self-sufficiently in a built world below in the sea \u2013 in the so-called \u2018Elysium\u2019. The people of Elysium fled from the war, which has ruled some decades before on the surface, to live in this refuge and come to peace. Of course they are ready to do everything for this peace and for the protection of their town in the deep ocean, some more than others. Particularly \u201amother\u2019 \u2013 the leader in Elysium \u2013 has prescribed her life for this town and for the backup of the future. Evie is her adopted daughter and therefore she is trained in all to become the next leader in the Elysium.But her destiny changes, after a surface dweller succeeds in breaking into Elysium. He gets arrested by the guards and now Evie should try to receive special answers from him. How did he find them? How did he get in? Whether there are even more, which will follow? etc. But Gavin \u2013 this is his name \u2013 doesn\u2019t let himself get into this questioning so easily and involves Evie in a questions\u2013answers-play and with that he not only lures her slowly from her reserve and win her for himself \u2013 but also the readers and above all me :)I also liked Evie, because she\u2019s a figure which can also sort things out and stands up for herself and for other people or important values. I found that great \u2013 no matter which consequences she may gather from it. But Gavin, Gavin, was simply great! Slowly I\u2019ve fallen in love with him together with Evie more and more, also although he had bright hair and I have pictured him at first dark-haired. He is the typical warrior, with a gentle side and a bright mind. He only could have had quietly some more rough edges, but I think, we will see them in the next part.Otherwise, according to other characters in the book, it was quite thin. Primarily it was about these two figures, or also about \u2018mother\u2019, the remaining ones were just minor characters and thus they also appear neutral in the action.There we would be at the story of the book, which has increased greatly, with a slow entrance \u2013 to describe the situation in Elysium \u2013 with growing tension, which tapers almost at the end to the final highlight. Sometimes it was a little bit nerve-wracking for me and particularly the second part \u2013 at the end \u2013 it was also a little fierce. So the also appears blood \u2013 a lot of blood \u2013 dangerously, also terrible scenes for the head cinema and though here it hasn\u2019t disturbed me, I even found it super-duper. But I think that the recommended age for the book is too young with 13-17 years, and I think it should be raised to 15+.I have liked the end very well and I was glad about how it has gone out. For me it was a \u2018true end\u2019 and if you ask me, this book also wouldn\u2019t need a second part, but could also stand alone. It even would be refreshing to read once again an independent stand-alone book in the fantasy/ YA book genre. But of course a few threads and questions stay open and point to another, second part and I\u2019m curious on the further ideas, Souders still has to offer here.For more Info: http://martinabookaholic.wordpress.co... Deutsche Rezension: Zu allererst \u2013 das Cover ist zwar total sch\u00f6n und es gibt auch teilweise den Inhalt dieser Unterwasserstadt wieder \u2013 ABER alle Protagonisten in diesem Buch sind BLOND \u2013 und nicht wie hier gezeigt schwarzhaarig. Bitte daran denken, ich habe mich n\u00e4mlich dar\u00fcber etwas ge\u00e4rgert w\u00e4hrend dem Lesen.Aber nun weiter zum Buch \u2013 Ich habe mich total gefreut, als ich es bekommen habe und auch nach dem zweiten Schock, hat es mir richtig gut gefallen. Warum noch einmal Schock? Die ersten Seiten waren sehr einfach gehalten, die Aussagen und Gedanken der Hauptfigur Evelin, oder kurz Evie genannt, waren kindlich und sehr irritierend, da sie wie einstudierte Texte wirkten und sie haben mich auch ehrlich gesagt verwirrt. Ich dachte schon, \u201aoh nein\u2019 \u2013 was ist das f\u00fcr eine schr\u00e4ge Person und das Buch wird wohl nichts f\u00fcr mich sein. Au\u00dferdem hatte ich das Gef\u00fchl in dem Film \u201aUnd t\u00e4glich gr\u00fcsst das Murmeltier\u2019 festzustecken und ich war schon auf das schlimmste eingestellt. Aber da habe ich etwas zu vorschnell geurteilt, denn Evie hat sich von Grund auf ge\u00e4ndert und verwandelt und ihr \u201awahres Ich\u2019 kam sp\u00e4ter zum Vorschein und es gibt auch einen Grund f\u00fcr ihr anf\u00e4ngliches bizarres Verhalten und Denken, was im Verlauf der Geschichte erkl\u00e4rt und gel\u00f6st wird.Nat\u00fcrlich fragt man sich an dieser Stelle, was passiert ist um diese Ver\u00e4nderung auszul\u00f6sen, in einer Gesellschaft, die v\u00f6llig abgeschieden und autark in einer erbauten Welt unten im Meer lebt \u2013 im sogenannten Elysium. Die Menschen von Elysium sind vom Krieg, der einige Jahrzehnte zuvor an der Oberfl\u00e4che geherrscht hat, in dieses Refugium gekommen um ein Frieden zu leben. Nat\u00fcrlich sind sie bereit f\u00fcr diesen Frieden und f\u00fcr den Erhalt ihrer Stadt im tiefen Ozean alles zu tun, manche mehr als andere. Besonders \u201aMutter\u2019 \u2013 die F\u00fchrerin/ Herrscherin im Elysium \u2013 hat ihr Leben verschrieben f\u00fcr diese Stadt und f\u00fcr die Sicherstellung der Zukunft. Evie ist ihre Adoptivtochter und die somit wird sie in allem ausgebildet, um die n\u00e4chste Herrscherin im Elysium zu werden.Aber ihr Schicksal ver\u00e4ndert sich, nachdem es einem Oberfl\u00e4chenbewohner gelingt in Elysium einzubrechen. Er wird von den Wachen festgenommen und Evie soll nun versuchen gewisse Antworten von ihm zu erhalten. Wie er hierher gefunden hat? Wie er rein gekommen ist? Ob es noch mehr gibt? usw. usf. Aber Gavin \u2013 so ist sein Name \u2013 l\u00e4sst sich nicht so einfach auf diese Verh\u00f6r ein und verwickelt Evie in ein Fragen \u2013 Antworten Spiel und somit kann er nicht nur Evie langsam aus der Reserve locken und f\u00fcr sich gewinnen \u2013 sondern auch die Leser und vor allem mich :)Ich mochte ja auch Evie, da sie eine Figur ist, die auch anpacken kann und sich einsetzt f\u00fcr Leute und Werte, die ihr wichtig sind. Das fand ich toll \u2013 egal welche Konsequenzen sie daraus bezieht. Aber Gavin, Gavin, war einfach klasse! Ich habe mich gemeinsam mit Evie langsam immer mehr in ihn verliebt, auch obwohl er helle Haare hatte und ich ihn mir zu Beginn dunkelhaarig vorgestellt habe. Er ist der typische Krieger, mit sanfter Seite und hellen Verstand. Er h\u00e4tte ruhig ein paar mehr Ecken und Kanten haben k\u00f6nnen, aber ich denke, das werden wir dann noch im n\u00e4chsten Teil sehen.Ansonsten war es Charakter-m\u00e4\u00dfig ziemlich d\u00fcnn im Buch. Haupts\u00e4chlich ging es um diese zwei Figuren, oder auch um Mutter, die restlichen waren Nebenfiguren und so farblos erscheinen sie auch in der Handlung.Wo wir bei der Geschichte w\u00e4ren, die sich gut gesteigert hat, mit einem langsamen Einstieg, um die Situation in Elysium zu schildern, mit anwachsender Spannung, die sich fast zum Ende hin zu einem H\u00f6hepunkt zuspitzt. Manchmal war es etwas nervenaufreibend f\u00fcr mich und besonders der zweite Teil, zum Ende hin, war dann doch schon etwas heftig. Also es kommt auch Blut vor \u2013 viel Blut \u2013 gef\u00e4hrlich, auch grausige Szenen f\u00fcr das Kopfkino und hier hat es mich zwar nicht gest\u00f6rt, fand es sogar ganz toll. Aber ich denke, dass das empfohlene Alter von 13-17 zu jung ist, und es auf 15 angehoben werden sollte.Das Ende hat mir sehr gut gefallen und ich war froh, wie es ausgegangen ist. F\u00fcr mich war es ein richtiger Abschluss und wenn es nach mir ginge, br\u00e4uchte das Buch auch keinen weiteren Teil, sondern k\u00f6nnte auch so alleine stehen. W\u00e4re auch einmal ganz erfrischend ein eigenst\u00e4ndiges Fantasie-/ Jugendbuch zu lesen.Aber nat\u00fcrlich bleiben ein paar F\u00e4den und Fragen offen und weisen auf einen weiteren, zweiten Teil hin, wobei ich gespannt bin auf die weiteren Ideen, die Souders hier noch zu bieten hat.F\u00fcr mehr Infos: http://martinabookaholic.wordpress.co..."}, {"userName": "Zuleeza", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4883387-zuleeza", "userReview": "[Before I end this review, my one little criticism is that I hope there were more descriptions given as to how the citizen actually live their life.

Sixteen-year-old Evelyn Winters was raised and trained to be Daughter of People, to rule over the underwater utopia known as Elysium. her life was close to perfect, or at least that's what she believed. When she met a surface dweller named Gavin, and helped him escape prison, she realized everything she believed is was nothing but a mere lie and result of her memory alternation.Together they tried to escape Elysium, but would they succeed to escape the iron fist of the women whom she called Mother, who is nothing but a control freak monstrous women. Underwater UtopiaI fell in love with the book, and the world building. I was amazed to experience the underwater utopia, the brilliant creation of the author. It was vivid and well planned. The underwater world seriously sucked me in. I mean, seriously that evil women who claimed herself as Mother of People, really scared me. She proceeded to destroy everything and everyone who was against her. She wanted to control Elysium in her own terms which was nothing but domination. Brainwashing and Surface DwellerI have always valued character's growth with progress book, and I love when a character discovers her true potential. That's another reason, I loved Renegade so much. In the beginning, Evelyn was just a fragile girl, more like a mechanical being or rather an empty puppet of her fake mother. She kept repeating lines such as My life is just about perfect or It's nice to have someone to talk to, and that strongly implied something was wrong with her, and her behavior also worried Gavin. Together they discover the truth behind her strange persona. I loved her strength and courage and curiosities, qualities that must require for a strong protagonist. Gavin was just adorable, a good male lead or rather a great support to Evelyn's character. I don't have much to say about him, as in most part of the book Evelyn overshadowed Gavin. All Well That Ends WellHoly Mother of Elysium.......this book was breathtaking. I finished it in one one sitting. The book conjured a desire to go on, even after the ending, I couldn't stop myself from thinking about the book.I really have a high expectation for the upcoming squall, and it better quenches my thirst."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8833797-jason", "userReview": "I was expecting a kickass twisted version of The Little Mermaid based on the quite cool-sounding concept and the excerpt of the beginning. I got\u2026another in a long line of 2012's meh standard YA dystopias. I guess the plot and prose are okay, if pedestrian, except for sporadic gross gems like this: \u201cIt\u2019s sexy and scary at the same time.\u201d The characterization is very flat and one-dimensional, with the most disappointing character being villain Mother who sounds like a teenage girl, throwing out lines like \u201cYou know. The basics.\u201d It reminds me of Lisa Simpson trying to fit in with the other kids by saying, \u201clike, you know, whatever.\u201d The heroine is your typical bland but supposedly \u201cbadass\u201d Chosen One Mary Sue, who falls in insta-love with a bland guy who she\u2019s just Not Supposed to Be With. Guess what Gavin Hunter enjoys doing in his spare time? Though to be fair, initially she\u2019s a dazed bland girl and he\u2019s incredibly annoying, so I guess they get better. She really is \u201cselfish, flighty, and foolish\u201d the way Mother says she is, but there are worse YA heroines.The world-building is very poor. Maybe it\u2019s because the dialogue sounds like it could come from any YA book, and Gavin references \u201ccreepy horror movies\u201d and baseball in such a way that it sounds like he lives in 2012 despite some war that apparently ruined most of America so that the few cities left are gated and guarded. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s down to Souders being lazy. And I\u2019m not sure why the book is in present tense; Souders isn\u2019t nearly a good enough writer to pull it off, and it serves no apparent purpose.Other things: Vegetarianism is evil is a random message the book sends.

Before its release I read reviews from people who had read ARC\u2019s of it and they were all glowing. People loved how bloody it was and how twisted the books bad guy, Mother, was. I went into this with super high expectations, I had an opening in my review schedule and thought it was finally time to sit down and soak up the awesomeness of this book. So sit down with it I did, and wait for awesomeness I did. Did that awesomeness come? Yes, but in the last 70 pages or so. And this leads me to want to talk about expectations.I always try my hardest to stay away from reviews of books that I know I want to read eventually. I don\u2019t want my opinion to be clouded by what I have read about the novel and I\u2019ve come to realize that I also don\u2019t ever want to go into a book with high expectations. I had expected some over the top bloody fun and a sick and twisted, sinister woman who calls herself Mother. I think I had glorified how epically twisted this tale would be because of what I had read about it. I honestly was wondering throughout if I was reading the same book as the people who wrote those glowing reviews. The story revolves around Evelyn, who was adopted by Mother and deemed the Daughter of the People. She is being trained to take over for mother once she can\u2019t rule anymore and she is also expected to couple at 16 and start popping out heirs so Mother can ensure the world of Elysium will remain under their family\u2019s rule. I have to say that Elysium was a fascinating place, the view that is described when they look out the glass walls and see the marine life going about their business was just gorgeous. I also loved the idea of Evelyn\u2019s garden, when I pictured it in my head it was breathtaking. While the scenery was stunning I longed for more in depth world building as far as the DNA tracking goes. The people of Elysium are all described as blonde haired and blue eyed, needless to say it seems only white people are chosen to live within the confines of the glass walls. Never are we told what makes the perfect genetic code in mother\u2019s eyes. At one point they run a surface dwellers (someone who still lives on land, not under water) DNA through their scientific DNA readers and he is said to have the perfect genetic make up to produce children in this society, but why? I wanted to know WHAT made a person suitable for breeding, and not just their hair and eye color (his eyes weren\u2019t even blue, they were grey.) Now onto the grey eyed weirdo of the story. Gavin is a boy who lives on land and finds his way into Elysium via a tunnel that he finds in a cave. He is quickly captured and thrown into prison where he becomes one of Evelyn\u2019s many tasks. She is to find out how he got into Elysium. Of course there has to be a romance, so once Evie starts questioning him she finds that surface dwellers are not the evil beings Mother has made them out to be. I wasn\u2019t a big fan of neither Evie nor Gavin so I didn\u2019t give a hoot about their romance. Maybe I didn\u2019t like Evie because she was constantly being affected by her conditioning (brain wiping) and we never got know who she actually was. She was just all over the map in this and it seemed like every 50 pages she turned into someone else (which was always attributed to the conditioning.) I tired of hearing about what had been done to her about half way through and just wanted to get to know her. Gavin was pretty blah, he fell in love with Evie pretty fast even when that definitely was NOT a good idea (can\u2019t say why because it would be a spoiler.) The story mostly revolves around Evie helping Gavin escape Mother\u2019s evil clutches and the twisted world of Elysium. I didn\u2019t really find mother to be as intense as I had expected (once again high expectations suck people!) I ended up finding her pretty hoity toity and boring to be honest. Which sucks, a lot. I really need to be careful moving forward about reading glowing reviews of books that I am going to be reading myself. Would I have liked this one more if I didn\u2019t have those expectations? I\u2019m not sure and I guess I will never know."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "A copy of Renegade was provided to me by Tor Teen/Netgalley for review purposes.'We are all Mother's children. It is a privilege to show her our ultimate obedience to her laws.'Evelyn Winters is the Daughter of the People in the underwater world of Elysium. She is a flawless specimen with ideal genes perfectly suited to create flawless children. Mother has worked hard to solidify Evelyn\u2019s perfection and the perfection of all citizens in Elysium. Mother will do anything and everything to make sure this remains so. All is not as it appears in Elysium. Look carefully, beyond the perfection.... and you'll see the malevolence hidden closely beneath the surface. 'Greed has poisoned men's souls. Surface Dwellers have destroyed what was once beautiful and turned it into a ghostly illusion of what they call peace. But down here, we have real peace. There will be no fear, or sickness, hunger, hate, or greed. We have created our Utopia. And it is magnificent.'Evelyn is told from an early age that her people escaped to Elysium to hide from the evil Surface Dwellers that war with one another but when a Surface Dweller manages to breach Elysium Evelyn can\u2019t help but be intrigued by him. His name is Gavin and with his help Evelyn realizes that the very world she lives in is a complete lie.An underwater utopia? How. Awesome. I loved the descriptions and details of how everything worked and how people managed to not only survive but to truly thrive and be completely self-sufficient under the sea. I would have loved for it to be explained more in detail in the beginning rather than a conversation between Evelyn and Gavin when he\u2019d ask a question here and there. I believe an introduction in the beginning on the underwater society would have been better.Very intriguing from the very first page, it\u2019s quite obvious that something is wrong with Evie and it all has to do with Mother. The introduction of Gavin had to be done in order to set in motion the entire story, but I didn\u2019t buy how incredibly easy it was for her to understand and accept that she was being brainwashed. You'd think that for someone that was brainwashed for over almost her entire life wouldn't just begin having doubts just because someone (that she doesn't even know) randomly suggests it once. I think if there was more time spent on the overall character building that I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with Evie trusting Gavin immediately or their instant bond which while it wasn\u2019t quite insta-love veered a bit too close for my liking.\u2019\u2026I shiver at the sounds surrounding me: Gavin\u2019s gasping breaths. The thunder of my heartbeat. The ripping of flesh. And, making it all worse, the man\u2019s rasping voice as he sings.\u2019The action is intense and ongoing and it never seems to let up throughout the extent of the book. Towards the end though, the story takes an extremely gruesome turn. Mother was a truly evil villain and one that conducted some particularly shocking experiments in order to secure her perfect society. A textbook villain is one that is willing to do whatever is required to get what she wants, and Mother was definitely prepared to do that. You don\u2019t realize till then end bits just how far she had gone with her experiments and what the end result was.When I began this story I was under the impression that it was a standalone novel but there were far too many questions that were left unanswered for there not to be a follow-up. I will definitely be reading the follow-up, I\u2019m quite excited to find out how everything is explained and to see where the author takes the story. Despite the few issues I had and the lower rating this was still a highly enjoyable, edge-of-your-seat kind of read that fans of dystopian and sci-fi genres will enjoy.2.5 stars overall"}, {"userName": "Beth  (YA Books Central)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5064568-beth-ya-books-central", "userReview": "I went into Renegade not really quite sure of what it was about...I read some others reviews and could tell that it was definitely Dystopian so of course I had to read it. Let me first say that the cover is COMPLETELY gorgeous and is a perfect portrayal of what I had imagined for Evie. I love the soft blue colors and the fact that she is holding the rose and looks so innocent...PERFECT COVER...The first couple of chapters were a little hard for me to wrap my head around..and only because Evelyn seemed like a robot. Everything seemed to \"goody-goody\" to be realistic. Once I continued reading I realized that this was the entire purpose of the story. WOW...I seriously could not put this book down...From the first few chapters I was hooked. The whole \"sunny bright everything is perfect\" concept in the first chapter got me. I knew that it meant something badddd was going to happen and I dived into the book to find out what..I found myself turning pages late into the night..The whole world of Elysium is breathtakingly fascinating...The whole under water-new world concept immediately grabbed me. I couldn't wait to find out how this was possible, how they survived this long, and the story explains it all. Evelyn, also known as Evie, starts the story out describing her perfect world and life. She is so sweet and innocent and then almost immediately the story is thrown into turmoil and pain. It completely shocked me. I mean wow...Then comes the other main character, Gavin. Ah, Gavin....He is ruggedly handsome and a Surface Dweller. He has broken in to their secret world and this is unacceptable. As in all good stories it is good vs evil and as far as Evie knows..Gavin is evil..He is the abomination known as Surface Dwellers and must be stopped. Little do they know there is a bigger \"Evil\" to come...\"Mother\", as she is known to the her people, places Evie in charge of Gavin's interrogation. She hopes to discover how he reached their underwater world and how he got in. Of course, she has ulterior motives...AS soon as Evie and Gavin meet you can immediately tell it is a romance written in the stars. I loved the way they grew to each other and the way they affected each other. The moments they had were mesmerizing. This book has so many twists and turns that I am afraid I may give away to much...It was just so awesome and I loved it. I loved how creepy \"Mother\" is and how she ended up......HA!

Not only did it sound fantastic, it looked fantastic (see (1) below). So color me excited when I got my hands on a sweet ARC to read!Here are five things I have to say about RENEGADE:1) I adore this cover! It's seriously one of the most intriguing (and beautiful) covers I've seen in ages. From the colors to the hair, dress, and body language of the girl, it completely drew me in and made me want to read it.2) There is repetition in the novel done for effect, and I loved it. Seriously, it brought a smile to my face as I turned the page and started the new chapter. I enjoyed looking for the small changes and seeing where the story diverged. And it totally helped me understand and sympathize with the main character, Evelyn.3) So I'm guessing this is the start of a trilogy, and lots of times, in the first book of a trilogy, we're left wondering at the end, \"how did things ever get like this?\" It made me so happy that RENEGADE explained the world and how it had come to be in its current dystopic state. Sure, that may change or we may not have the whole truth, but for now, I have my explanation and am happy.4) I have to mention the romance, because I really loved seeing how the main characters were pushed/pulled together. I enjoyed watching their trust of each other grow alongside their feelings. Neither character is perfect. Both have some serious issues. But together, they are fabulous!5) It's like MATCHED meets SERENITY, under the ocean. RENEGADE is packed with adventure, betrayal, deception, and romance.

And yet another greatly-reviewed book that I couldn't love, or, as it is the case with this one, even tolerate. Dystopias lately have turned into a formula, and it repeats itself novel after novel. I don't think I was wrong to think Renegade would be different, and in some aspects it was, but, when it came down to it, this novel suffered from some of the major flaws that most dystopias suffer these days.The whole concept of the underwater Utopia had me from the start. As a fan of Bioshock, my mind made the immediate connection and through the first chapters, as the whole world unfurled, I was mystified. Sounders did a pretty good job in the physical construction of this world. Where it failed was in the backstory, but I'll get to that. Those first chapters kicked the novel off with a bang. It was incredibly engaging at first, and it managed the concept of the dystopia extremely well and it also began to establish a very formidable and convincing antagonist. But then it all went downhill after that.This novel is not short on action, suspense and intrigue, and it is also nicely written, but there were some very important key factors that ruined it. First off, the romance. It was of the insta-love variety, - no, of the really hardcore insta-love variety. Two days and she was in love. Two conversations and she was risking her life for him. I had a really hard time connecting that Evie to the one from the very first chapters. The entire narration changed inexplicably when Gavin came in, and the entire plot lost its coherence. A lot started to surface after that, a lot more than the plot could handle at such speed. Genetic modification, selective memory erasing, secret trainings; it all came too fast for the character of Evie to accommodate it into believable character development and the whole character fell shortly after that. Her behavior was inconsistent, her development erratic, and the romance was unbelievable, chemistry-less and even slightly irritating. My biggest problems with this novel are the lack of world-building and the convenient plot-devices strewn all over the story to make the convoluted plot progress when it couldn't on its own. The world-building in this story is nothing short of terrible and incredibly inconsistent. We get a short explanation for this underwater Utopia's existent, but the novel barely touches on that again or on the history of the world outside that lead to this, and when it does, it is not convincing in the slightest. Furthermore, Evie's entire world was full of unexplainable technological inconsistencies that I had a hard time reading about. I'm supposed to believe that they are so technologically advanced that they can manage genetic modification, selective memory erasing, even freaking healing wands and yet there's flat screen TVs and normal looking computers about? That there are security devices that identify DNA and yet they have an interrogation room that has just one camera without sound recording? The list goes on and on, with inconsistencies that stretch into language comprehension (Evie somehow couldn't understand the use in slang of some words, like hot and suck, but she knew others like sexy), and cultural (supposedly the world rejected religion, but there were several mentions of it). Moreover, the convenient plot-devices were equally frustrating. Every time the plot hit a stop, one of two things would happen: Evie would either listen to another person's conversation which would be conveniently focused on the information that she needed right that moment, or she would find a journal that would be extremely specific in its entries with the information that would lead Evie to realize the purpose of one area in the dome, the role of one person or what was happening with her. These happen several times in the novel and it got cheesier and more and more cliched each time. This novel was a very good idea with a mediocre execution. It started okay, but it progressed forcefully using terrible and cliched devices while carrying a heavier load that it could bear to hold. Bad romance, underdeveloped characters, terrible world-building and frustrating inconsistencies, Renegade is a novel that had the potential to be great, but, in the end, simply failed to live up to it. -----------------------------------------------------------------------After Reading Impressions:There's no nice way to say this, so I'll just go out and say that I am extremely disappointed with this book. Renegade has one of the most interesting concepts I've read about in a while. An underwater dystopia? Genetic modification, advanced technology and kickass women? It simply sounds amazing. And then the reviews! Most of the reviewers I trust have loved this one. Obviously, I went into it expecting my mind to be blown with the sheer awesomeness that this book was supposed to be. I won't say it is terrible because that would be a lie. It is not badly-written or terribly-plotted or even boring. It packs a lot of tension and action, as a matter of fact, and the the novel managed the concept of a dystopia extremely well.But then there's the inconsistencies with the world-building and plot-points, the irregularities with the technology (DNA detection cameras, but no sound in the cameras in the interrogation room / selective memory erasing and magic healing wands but common-day computers and flat screens TVs / incompetent guards that fail to actually guard anything and are easily fooled by a sixteen-year old girl) and lapses in knowledge in the characters (she knows what sexy means but not hot), the super insta-love (two days, two conversations and she decided she wanted to couple with him), the predictability and the convenient plot points. Needed to understand what was going on? Evie just pressed her ear to a door, listened to a conversation and got all the information she needed, which happens several times throughout the novel. And then there's the cheesiest and most cliched of the convenient bridges between plots: the tell-all and extremely specific journals that everybody seems to be leaving lying around for others to find with detailed entries with every type of back-story knowledge or explanation the protagonist might need. I am extremely pissed with this book because I was honestly expecting this to be amazing, and the worst part is that it had the tools to be just that."}, {"userName": "Christina (A Reader of Fictions)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions", "userReview": "I suspect I know what you're thinking. You're looking at that cover and imagining that this will be yet another cheesy romance disguised as dystopia, with a world built solely to keep the hero and heroine from being able to get it on. Well, let me tell you right now, this is not the case here. The cover is beautiful and has a girl in a dress and just doesn't look like the cover for a true, creepy dystopia. You know what, though? This cover fits the book perfectly AND Renegade also happens to be a true dystopia, one that is freaky and creepy as all get out, and, oh my, did I love it.You're still skeptical, right? I mean, the first sentence is \"My life is just about perfect.\" That's a little barf-inducing. That was my thought too, so I don't begrudge you this suspicion. I worried at first because it did seem like what I expected: a selfish, naive heroine and a cheesy setup for a romance. I mentally prepared myself for the imminent headdesk that didn't come. I promise you that there's a reason that Evelyn acts the way she does in the beginning, and that reason is dark and shiver-inducing.What's funny is that for the first couple of chapters this book is straight-up The Little Mermaid. I could think of nothing else at first, and it still makes me laugh. Evelyn likes to spend a lot of time in her garden, the privileged favorite of Mother, the leader of the people. Evelyn, though mostly a good daughter, is a little forgetful, a little disobedient. More obviously, Evelyn gets into trouble for collecting a coin from the surface, since, you know, they live in a community under the sea and aren't supposed to be interested in those on the surface. Mother's wrath reminded me heavily of Triton's when Ariel was all obsessed with the Eric statue and saved the real Eric and everything (though his anger pales in comparison to Mother's when the surface dweller Gavin appears, though that's a topic for later). Anyway, this concludes my discussion of The Little Mermaid.Things quickly take a turn for the much less Disney, however. Enjoy the lava-shiny happy bits while they last, because it's pretty much going to be a mindfuck for the rest of the journey. As I've mentioned Mother is one scary bitch. She reminds me a bit of Eldest from Across the Universe for those of you who are familiar with that: willing to do anything to make sure her utopia remains just that. She has some serious control issues. Perhaps, though, you need a concrete example of just how horrifyingly awful and terrifying she is to believe my assessment. Well, I'll do you one better: I'll give you two examples. 1. Mother has created her idea of the perfect society in her underwater paradise. Elysium is entirely self-sufficient, can produce all of its food, technology and materials right there, with no need to go to the violent, war-torn surface. They are safe and happy. Every single person in Elysium is also blonde-haired and blue-eyed. Yeah, if taking a page out of Hitler's book doesn't have you fetching a straitjacket to stuff Mother into, then I think you probably need to go get some more education.2. Even more horrific, since Mother could perhaps have just collected good Aryan stock to bring down with her and not created her society of people with what she believes to be perfect genetics through genocide, are the Enforcers. Every society needs police, of course, because accidents happen and people aren't perfect. Mother's Enforcers, though, are all women, taken from their parents at the age of three to be molded into the perfect killing machines.Yeah, so this one definitely is not in the camp of fluffy books packaged as dystopias as an effort to make more money. It IS a dystopia. Hurrah! I really appreciated Souders' world building and writing, which worked really well with the story she's telling. I also thought the snippets of the society's governing tenants and documents were used to great effect at the beginning of each chapter.The only weak point for me at all was in the characterization. Of course, this is largely intentional, I think, though I cannot explain precisely why without spoiling something I want to leave completely new to you. I think she gets the narration exactly right for what she's doing, but Evelyn is a little hard to feel with as a result. I will say thought that Evelyn will probably surprise you. She grows and changes constantly as the book progresses; like the ocean, she has hidden depths. Because we get everything through Evelyn's lens, however, the other characters do not coalesce into anything tangible.More troubling is the instalove. Yes, I know, I hear you crying. While not ideal, I do think the instalove here is less obnoxious than most because of the circumstances they're in and because the society does not exist solely to keep them apart. The romance is there, but it's not the central struggle of the book.Renegade is jam-packed with action and will totally mess with your head. There are a lot of dissapointing dystopias out there, as happens in any absurdly popular genre, but this one rocks and is definitely worth a read for dystopian fans. I am so excited to find out what will happen in the next book, because the story could go so many places right now and that's just fabulous!"}, {"userName": "Anorielt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5995959-anorielt", "userReview": "Erster Satz: Mein Leben ist absolut perfekt.Eine Unterwasserwelt..... erfrischend neu und mit einer Geschichte die aus der Masse heraussticht?

Souders. In my opinion, every single aspect of this book deserves high praise, from the detailed cover art to the depth (no pun intended) of the author\u2019s prose. She has created a captivating and unique underwater society in which the residents all have entertaining personalities and are a huge part of why this novel is so wonderful. In a way, this book could represent dystopia, but excluding the whole \u2018end-of-the-world\u2019 theme. It has different districts with a matriarch called \u201cMother\u201d, who right of the bat to me seemed\u2026off. She rules over an underwater settlement called Elysium, in which there is power, surprisingly, and the mer-people actually do inhale oxygen, once again, surprisingly. She\u2019s everything you don\u2019t expect a mother to be. Complete opposite, totally batty, I can\u2019t say enough times how much this woman is crazy. But she\u2019s not only crazy, she\u2019s creep-tastic, and exactly as described in the synopsis, a monster.I really liked Evelyn as a main character, although my relationship with her character had a rocky start. I\u2019ve learned to not judge a character by the first few chapters, ok, maybe the first few sentences, a while back, but I still end up judging them anyway. And this is why I didn\u2019t like Evie in the very beginning. She came across as a very annoying and dull character, and I was instantly turned off with her perspective. But thank god for character growth because she gives Sharpay from High School Musical (XD) a run for her money with the sudden twists of personality. Evie grows from wimp to kick-ass, and dull to pretty damn interesting. I mean, come on, she faces a mother who tells her to dress up in a baby doll black dress and go hunt for boys, I think that crossed the line of attention-grabbing a few sentences ago. As she discovers more about her past and who she truly is, the book takes a turn for the better with even better dialogue and more of an engaging plotline. I really hope that there\u2019s an ever bigger growth in her with the second book, but as of now, Evie has been the perfect main character for Renegade.The romance in this book was very sweet and natural. It wasn\u2019t rushed, but it wasn\u2019t torturingly slow either, it moved at a perfect pace. Gavin has a very down-to-earth, funny, and charming personality, which I felt was very refreshing from the regular tough bad-boys I read about. His interactions with Evie and their adventures together exploring the whole of Elysium and its different societies were entertaining to read about and very engaging. Gavin was definitely a great add to this book, and I will be looking forward to reading more about him and his relationship with Evie in the next book. Overall, a great novel with jaw-dropping plot-twists, a unique utopian society, and a romance that\u2019s sure to warm your heart."}, {"userName": "A Canadian Girl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2986731-a-canadian-girl", "userReview": "If I could sum up J.A. Souders\u2019 Renegade with one word, I\u2019d use a word like messy because the frenetic pacing of the plot made it hard to follow what was going on. It also caused the development of the world, characters and romance to be sacrificed.My first problem with Renegade was that the worldbuilding was sketchy at best. As a reader, I knew that Mother, her dad and their friends moved to Elysium to avoid war on land. That\u2019s all I got though, really. I couldn\u2019t fully comprehend the way that Elysium was set up \u2013 a map might have been nice since Gavin (who I still feel like I barely know!) and Evie were running all over the place \u2013 nor did I know what was going on on the Surface because Gavin doesn\u2019t really speak much about the subject. I assumed at first that the people of Gavin\u2019s community were living almost a pre-Industrial lifestyle since Gavin talks people getting married at a young age, trading and going hunting; but I later had to amend my thoughts when Gavin mentions video games.I also couldn\u2019t make myself care about the characters. Initially, the tone of the novel was great because although things seemed perfect for Evie, there was this underlying feeling of menace. However, over time, Evie\u2019s repeated episodes of forgetfulness became more annoying than chilling to me, and made it hard to connect with her. When characters themselves don\u2019t know who they are, how can you get to know them properly?! Evie\u2019s forgetfulness also seemed as if it was just a convenient way for the author to get her characters to uncover another secret.Lastly, I hated the romance because I thought it lacked chemistry and involved insta-love. From reading Evie\u2019s perspective, it felt as if the reason she fell for Gavin was because he looked so different from the people of Elysium \u2013 meaning not only was he a Surface Dweller \u2013 something she\u2019s fascinated by \u2013 but also because he had gray eyes instead of the Aryan qualities sought and cultured by Mother. As well, I was a bit weirded out by the fact that Evie could be so casual about Coupling with a guy she didn\u2019t know anything about!With its flimsy worldbuilding and weak characterization and romance, this dystopian, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t for me!"}, {"userName": "Schokigirl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27136310-schokigirl", "userReview": "German Review:In \"Renegade - Tiefenrausch\" von J.A. Souders geht es um Evie, die die Tochter der Regentin der Unterwasserstadt Elysium ist. Sie f\u00fchrt scheinbar ein perfektes Leben. Doch als der Oberfl\u00e4chenbewohner Gavin auftaucht scheint ihre Fassade zu br\u00f6ckeln. Sie hat immer \u00f6fter Ged\u00e4chtnisl\u00fccken & komische Flashbacks. Und ihre Mutter, die Regentin, erscheint ihr auch immer agressiver & radikaler. Ist Elysium doch nicht das Paradise f\u00fcr das Evie es gehalten hat? Der Schreibstil ist fl\u00fcssig & angenehm. Die Geschichte wird aus Evies Sicht erz\u00e4hlt.Die Charaktere wirken auf den ersten Blick klar durchschaubar. Doch je weiter die Geschichte voran schreitet, umso vielschichtiger erscheinen sie. Sie wirken sympathisch & sehr gut nachvollziehbar. Die unsympathischen Charaktere lernt man schnell zu hassen. Sie sind aber nicht unrational, was die Geschichte spannender macht.Die Handlung war actionreich & spannend. Sogar blutig wurde es gegen Ende. Sie konnte mich voll mitnehmen. Der Plot & die Ideen haben mir gefallen. Es gab Wendungen & immer neue Informationen, die man nicht erwartet hat bzw sehns\u00fcchtig drauf gewartet hat. Ich hab es unheimlich gern gelesen.Fazit: 5 Sterne BUCHTIPP! Kann ich allen empfehlen, die eine spannende Dystopie suchen."}], "description": "Since the age of three, sixteen-year-old Evelyn Winters has been trained to be Daughter of the People in the underwater utopia known as Elysium.
