(those motherfuckers danced in the rain! talk about risking it all!)this is the middle book in a trilogy, so don't go running out to read it based on the \"strength\" of this review without first going out and getting hater.it is a fun bloody romping zombie-ish book that is a page-turning good time for those of us with anger management issues.i like that this book takes the genre of zombie fiction and gives it a little shove into deeper waters.the basics: about half of the population remains \"unchanged\", and the rest have gone mad with zombielike urges. these \"zombies\" aren't corpses, they are just people infected with the urge to kill. kill, kill, kill, dismember, smash, punch, kick, start over.good stuff.but they don't destroy mindlessly, like zombies, not entirely. this second volume mostly takes place in the mind of an infected, so you can see that they are thinking, or one of them is anyway, but there is a compulsion to kill and a planned rationale, of sorts, for their actions. it is a little more chilling when there is a methodology.when david wellington introduced zombie birds in monster island, i got crazy excited because it was so unexpected and frankly terrifying and as someone who has seen a ton of zombie movies, it was something new, finally. this one pulls a similar move. children!! rage-infected children!! badass vivisecting feeling-no-pain children!god, like they aren't scary enough already! for example, this fantastic movie:apparently guillermo del toro has snapped up the movie rights for hater, which is pretty lame, if you ask me, considering there is already a movie and a remake of same movie covering pretty much the same ground. but who am i to question the man? if you're not going to make the damn hobbit anymore, you do whatever you want, dude.is this a review? i can't tell anymore. all i know is, i took the day off work because my back refused to give me a break yesterday, and this was a fantastic companion for my day of rest. i will leave the billy bragg here, because i think the question remains, \"which side are you on, boy?\"me, i would probably have the rage.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbddqX..."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg", "userReview": "Karen's review says just about sums up the book. I read books like this for cool shit to happen. For instance, to read about a child killing an adult by eating through the persons chest. Maybe this isn't too realistic but it's cool shit. I want my horror novels to read like they were written by a sociopath. I want blood and gore, and fuck redeeming social value. More blood, more gore! Kill! Kill! Kill! This book delivers on the good stuff at the start and end of the book, but then gets mired down with story and social commentary. I don't mind social commentary or plot, but get back to the killing now and then. Horror novels shouldn't have to feel legitimized by adding redeeming qualities to them, leave that to the academics who want to make careers reading between the lines. More blood more gore! More vicious little children killing everything in sight!!"}, {"userName": "Schnaucl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/345066-schnaucl", "userReview": "Two and a half stars. (Some spoilers for Hater)I realized about halfway through that I was forcing myself to get through the book. Never a good sign.Part of what made Hater so good was how chilling Danny's behavior was after his change. He was 100% certain that he had to kill the Unchanged or they would kill him and during the kills he experience euphoria.In this book there was a bit of the euphoria but I never found his behavior chilling. While in Hater he acted on instinct in this book Danny spends lots of time whining about maybe not being \"good enough\" for the rest of the Haters. He feels like he should kill people but in a pretty half-hearted way unless there's actually an Unchanged person near him. It actually feels very like the daily grind of going to his old job except, you know, it's killing people so you can't really identify with him.It's hard to identify with anyone in this book (besides, maybe, his cousin who we only see for a short time. Maybe we're supposed to identify with Danny's drive to find his daughter, Ellis, except the reason he wants to find her is to care for her and so they can kill people together. So I wasn't rooting for that reunion. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a commentary on terrorists or unending war. There are some explicit references to terrorism so it might be that. Whatever the intention was, what's missing is passion. People may continue to fight a war long past the point where the original insult is forgotten. But they do it so that one day the war will be over and future generations can have a better life. People become terrorists because they believe in an ideology, because they think someone is occupying their land, because they think someone is keeping them from living their lives the way they want to, or teaching their kids the way they want to, or even because they don't believe in ideology but know if they become a terrorist, their family will be looked after financially. The Haters don't fight for anything. There's a line or two about after the Unchanged are dead but there's no passion for it. They fight against the Unchanged because they believe the Unchanged will kill them as soon as they realize what they are (of course, they wouldn't kill the Haters if the Haters weren't killing them). The problem is there's the occasional moment of fear but mostly the Haters are portrayed as feeling vastly superior (physically) to the Unchanged. So instead of a threat the Unchanged feel more like an annoyance.The Haters don't care about the future, or individuals. They only care about the fight. They only care about children insofar as Hater children make excellent fighters. I had the distinct impression that if the Haters managed to eradicate all of the Unchanged they wouldn't know what to do with themselves. Maybe sit around all day and talk about how great it was when there were Unchanged to kill. I realized by the end of the book that I couldn't imagine an ending to this trilogy that would leave me feeling satisfied. The Haters win and then sit around or they get wiped out and the Unchanged try to rebuild. Maybe there's a cure and I guess the Unchanged feel horror at what they've done. But none of that would satisfy me which is why I'm not going to bother with the third book. The real shame is that I think there was a genuinely moving and meaningful story to tell here. One of the characters says that the Unchanged are the true Haters because they promised \"never again\" after World War II but the moment they felt threatened they built slaughterhouses to kill the Haters in gas chambers. The problem is, you can't tell that story from the point of view of the Haters because they lack the emotional capacity for it."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "4.5 StarsI am such a big fan of David Moody as an author. I also love the genre that he specializes in, the post-apocalyptic. This book, Dog Blood is the second in the hater series. As I have mentioned before Moody does a superb job at making these horror stories about people. He creates characters that are true to life and three dimensional. Moody's Autumn series worked by creating a world filled with characters like you and me. There were no superheroes in that one, and many were very likable. In this series, The Hater series, we have a much tighter focus that centers around one man Danny McCoyne. This series has an awesome spin on the zombie genre, in that there are no undead here. We do not yet know why, but one day an apparent gene that is present in everyone suddenly turns on. Over one third of the world become changed, they become extremely violent and quite hopped up as well. They suddenly find that they have the insatiable need to kill those whom are unchanged.\u201cIn many ways the situation the Unchanged found themselves facing was indefensible. This conflict wasn\u2019t faction versus faction or army against army; it was individual versus individual, more than six billion armies of one. Beyond that, the Hate didn\u2019t care who you were, where you were, or what you were. You were simply on one side or the other, your position in this new, twisted, fucked-up world decided without your involvement by unknown variables and fate. Within weeks command structures at every level were compromised. Organizations fell apart. Families crumbled. The Haters were everywhere and everyone, the whole world beaten up from the inside out.\u201dThis creates a very interesting end of the world scenario, one that seems to be a bit more plausible than that of the dead coming back for revenge. The incredible pain and suffering that people must endure seeing their loved ones get killed by their family and friends is unimaginable. I can see this scenario being quite similar to say, putting a parrot in a room with a cat. You will see immediate fear in the poor bird, and the instant desire to kill in the cat. Sure, this is a predator \u2013 prey scenario, but it is not far off from the things that Moody paints about the humans in this series.This is an extremely violent novel. Not too heavy on the gore, but definitely over the top on the killings. And let me remind you, this is about people killing people\u2026 Our hero Danny is pretty much the only POV in this book. He is much less whiney now, focused on finding his daughter Ellie, and he uses his intelligence to drive himself forward. Danny becomes captured and has an interesting conversation with his captor, where he is told:\u201cPeople tell me I\u2019m wasting my time with your type. They tell me you\u2019re no better than animals, that you\u2019ve got dog blood running through your veins and you should be rounded up and shot.\u201dI will not give away any spoilers, so I will say that this is a very fast and violent book. The plot is simple, our hero Danny trying to find and reunite himself with his 5 year old daughter. The world is continuing to spiral downward as the \u201cHaters\u201d fight with the \u201cUnchanged\u201d. I highly recommend David Moody as a whole to all those that love zombie novels, and I am sure that the thriller readers would like him too."}, {"userName": "Alina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32420578-alina", "userReview": "Nice page-turner, with lots of action, killing, gore.

His wife, Lizzie has taken the family, the two boys and daughter, Ellis and hidden somewhere. Danny has been searching for months for his daughter, trying to save her so she can kill with him. He runs into and afoul of many different people in this book and is finally captured and sent to a mysterious group who imprisons him and injects him with a serum that begins to work on his genetic structure. These mysterious people eventually teach and train Danny to control his Hate and he moves on to meet their leader and understand that he is part of a plan to become a first strike weapon, with others of like mind. They are to infiltrate the Unchanged, almost like a terrorist cell and then cause explosions and mass chaos to where the military will respond in the only way they can, to carpet bomb the masses to try and eliminate as many Haters as possible. This is the way the Hater hierarchy has surmised will destroy many more of the Unchanged than they can by the current chaos that they deliver. Danny and crew enter the city and he goes out of his way to try and find his daughter, after looking up information on the only remaining database in the U.K., devoted to listing the survivors and last know addresses, compiled by the military. Danny finds his wife eventually and discovers that Ellis killed both of his sons. Lizzie and Danny's cousin, Mark have Ellis tied up inside an abandoned car. After much trials, Danny frees Ellis and catches up to her as she goes, hell bent on murder. He gets he eventually and as the city is being bombed, finds a way out and gets a vehicle to escape with. Danny can control his Hate but he has trouble controlling Ellis, who has become a killing machine. He gets out of the city in a stolen vehicle as the military drops a tactical nuke on London and its surrounding suburbs, flattening the region. Danny loses Ellis as she almost kills him to get away and kill more of the Unchanged. He is found by more of the militaristic Haters and saved, but Ellis is gone.This book continues on from the last first book and it is a roller coaster ride through Hades and back. I couldn't stop reading it, the interest overwhelmed me. I had to see what was going to happen. Rarely does a book captivate my attention so fervently. This one was amazing and I highly recommend it, as I did the first in the series. I just received the third book in the mail yesterday.

(And judging by Dog Blood's end, I'm going to posit that this is the middle book in a pending trilogy.) I am familiar with moody through the Autumn quartet, which I read four or five years ago and which have become something of a self-publishing success story, not only launching what has since become one of the most popular small horror presses in existence but also gaining Moody a contract with a major house. Which brings us to Dog Blood, the first book Moody has produced for Thomas Dunne (which previously re-released Hater).Dog Blood focuses on Danny McCoyne, one of the Haters, humans infected with a virus that drives them to kill anyone uninfected (the Haters call them the Unchanged). There are varying levels of Hate infection; Danny, for example, is still reasonable and intelligent, while others are what the Hater community calls Brutes, who have lost all reason and exist only to kill. (Hate infection is paralleled with addiction a number of times in the book, and Moody does an interesting job of drawing the distinction between maintenance addicts and junkies, if only anyone would listen.) The driving force in Danny's life is to find his daughter Ellis, also a Hater, and who has been missing since the initial outbreak of Hate four months previous. Meanwhile, a large number of the Unchanged have barricaded themselves inside the confines of a small city, and we get various updates on the state of life among the humans as we go on. You know these two storylines are going to collide eventually, and while it's kind of predictable, I love the connection Moody makes between them. Also, as in the Autumn novels, the guy really, really knows how to write a satisfying-yet-ambiguous-and-really-downbeat ending.A lot of the same problems I had with the Autumn quartet I had with Dog Blood. The writing is decent, if nothing spectacular; when you look at Moody's self-published work, it stands head and shoulders above much of the vanity/self-published stuff simply because Moody can actually write. Put him up against the bigs, however, and the shortcomings become clear pretty quick. Moody's writing is readable enough and well-paced, but it's often emotionless and always far more concerned with advancing the plot than with characterization. I rush to add this is not always a bad thing in genre fiction, and it's a lot less crucial here (where plot is king) than it was in the Autumn novels (which are much slower and focus more on character). Readable it is; I blew through it in an afternoon after finishing another short book. I wonder if I'd have gotten more out of it had I previously read Hater, but can't really answer that question for obvious reasons. To be on the safe side, I'll tell you that if this one interests you, go ahead and grab Hater first. ***"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369169-lori", "userReview": "From author for review - It's war baby, and the Unchanged don't stand a chance.In Dog Blood, the sequel to David Moody's novel Hater, No one cares about what caused the Hate anymore. Self-preservation is the priority. The world is beginning to fall apart, buildings rotting away or damaged in battle. Food and clean water is becoming harder and harder to come by. Unchanged men, women, and children slowly begin to move into the cities, cramming themselves into office buildings, and apartments, waiting for their food rations to be doled out. Soldiers take teams of volunteers out beyond the exclusion (or safe) zones to seek out people who have been surviving on their own, to bring them back to the home base. They feel safer and stronger in groups.Haters join together and attack these rescue missions, picking off the Unchanged one by one. The war between \"us\" and \"them\" is inescapable. And it won't stop until one or the other are wiped off the face of the planet.One Hater, our Hater, Danny, bounces from place to place, preferring to remain alone. He finds comfort in the shadows and the outskirts, believing that his ability to remain hidden, his hunger for killing, and his desire to find his 5 year old daughter Ellis is what has kept him alive this long. Yet, ironically enough, it's during his search for Ellis that Danny finds himself captured by a group of Unchanged people... who are determined to teach Danny how to hold the Hate.Can Haters be taught to control the urge to kill? Will they ever be able to walk among the Unchanged and blend in with society again?David Moody creates a bleak and devastating world in which man has turned against man, where trust and companionship no longer live, a world of constant turmoil and chaos. He takes us deeper inside Danny's head and introduces us to the filthy, brutal life of a Hater. Though Danny appears to be selfish and self serving, we discover that looking out for number one is the only way to ensure ones existence. It's the new way of life, and one that most people quickly adapted to.Brilliantly narrated, violent and ferocious, unlike anything I have read before it - With his Hater Trilogy, Moody ushers in the newest fiction monster craze! Say goodbye to Zombie and Vampire Lit, shelf the wanna-be-breakout novels about Angels and Unicorns. Moody's Haters are taking the world by force, and leaving a sea of bloody corpses in their wake.

In the very beginning I felt the author took a cop out when he said it didn't matter what caused this to happen, it did, now we just have to deal with it. I was looking for more of an explanation and this made me feel like the author couldn't explain it so he made it seem irrelevant to the characters in the book. Now, I praise Moody all the time for his books being realistic and if this were to happen I can bet people would still wonder how it happened despite also having to struggle just to survive everyday. It is not unimportant. I just felt the author made it irrelevant so he didn't have to offer up any further explanation.That being said, I did enjoy the book. It lagged in the beginning for a while and was kind of boring, but then it picked up about 30% in and kept my interest throughout. I was quite surprised at the turn of events. I thought the Haters and Unchanged were headed in a direction that turned out not to be the case. It was for the better.\u00a0This whole book Danny tries to find his daughter Ellis and he encounters some interesting people along the way such as Joseph and Sahota, who were pretty cool. We are also introduced to Mark, an Unchanged and follow him as he tries to survive the Haters with a pregnant girlfriend and in-laws housed up with them in some tiny apartment. Then they are forced to take in an Asian guy and are also taking care of some other woman. His part was not merely to show us the perspective from the Unchanged but to play a role with Danny later on in the book. After this encounter, the book gets really interesting and once again I didn't see that coming. This and the ordeal with Joseph and Sahota were the best parts of the book.So this book continues the story of the Haters vs. the Unchanged and introduces a few twists that knock your socks off. Now I am so curious to see how it all ends that I will gladly\u00a0go on to the third one next."}, {"userName": "Badseedgirl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20662786-badseedgirl", "userReview": "Dog Blood by David Moody is the second book in his \u201cHater\u201d series.

It is some kind of a miracle worthy of a visit from the Commission of Miracles, Danny s not the biggest arsehole in this book. Apparently becoming a Hater instantly turns a person into a giant murderous douche. Danny is actually one of the sensitive ones.

The people infected with it are called haters. Those who have gone through the change have an overwhelming desire to kill those who have not. The unchanged masses are pushed into secured areas patrolled by heavily-armed soldiers. Rations and living space are becoming more and more difficult to come by as any excursions out of the secure zones are generally met with hordes of homicidal people attacking relentlessly.The haters themselves are attempting to organize to better battle and eliminate the unchanged. For the most part, their people are simply roaming randomly from place to place to kill the unchanged as frequently as possible.We also find that the haters are not all the same. There are those among them who are much more aggressive and brutal, which is saying quite a bit with this bunch.The main character of this novel is Danny, a man who has evolved (or devolved if you want to think of it that way) into a hater. He is on a quest to locate his daughter, who he found to be like him in this series' first book; Hater. Danny is attempting to track down his former spouse in order to locate his daughter in a post-apocalyptic war torn England. Needless to say, this is no easy task and there are numerous obstacles and distractions from his own kind and the unchanged.I have to say, this is my favorite book of Moody's thus far. It is well-written and easy to fly through. I found myself really enjoying the thoughts and actions of the main character and wanting to see what happened at the turn of each page. The violence and action are both quick and easy to picture for the most part. Moody does not seem to feel that it is necessary to share every gory detail of every drop of blood shed and I am fine with that. It becomes dark and depressing at times. At other times you might find yourself filled with hope. Any of this can be shattered or changed in a heart beat. Expect the unexpected and don't trust anything or anyone at face value. Although this story is filled with action, it also takes time to explore the confused thoughts of Danny. After all, he still has all of his memories from before he changed.I would like to mention that I listed this on my Zombie shelf. The haters are not zombies per se, as they are living and breathing people. They are similar in the manner of the infected of 28 Days Later (although nothing like them beyond their aggression toward those not affected) in which I consider it close to a zombie outbreak. I'm sure that bit can be debated left and right. I just wanted to make it clear that by the book zombies do not play a part in Dog Blood.Anyway, pick up both books in this series.

Hater had the perfect build up, and I was right there with the McCoyne's as the world went to hell. In Dog Blood we are once again treated to alternating perspectives, but here we have, of course, Danny's perspective and we alternate between that and a third person narration following an unchanged named Mark around as he tries to survive in a changed world. While this one was definitely less exciting than its predecessor, it was a worthy follow up in the intensely strong world building.I loved how the two stories presented in Dog Blood intertwined throughout the novel and we got to see the characters tales blend together a bit. Danny's story is intense as he charges through, trying to find his daughter Ellis, who he knows is like him but was taken away by her mother. I was worried in the beginning that the novel would be a dragged out journey as he works his way to his daughter but the roadblocks he encounters really served to make it an interesting journey. This one gets a bit more political as the changed plan an uprising and a way to infiltrate the unchanged. I do feel that the first page of the novel stating that it doesn't matter why or how the change occurred was a cop-out and I really hope that those answers are still coming. I mean you can't have this happening to people and the world falling apart at the seams and not tell the reader what made it all happen. I don't care if it's a disease that comes from the saliva of bunnies, I just want some sort of reason.Once again we are left with an intriguing set up for the final installment in the series. I am dying to see more of the changed children and just what they are capable of (even though I am certain it will not be pretty.) What sets this series apart for me is really brought to light in this second installment; the changed have a method to their madness. They are intelligent and have the ability to be organized & reign in their desire to the point that they come across as calculated in their actions at times. This is a frightening concept, and it's what keeps me hungrily turning the pages.

The couple of issues I had with the first book still exist, and my questions have yet to be resolved. Nevertheless, it's a good read and does introduce a couple of new elements to the mix. Like the first book, I felt that the first two thirds of this were a little slow, but once it picked up momentum it really packed a punch. David Moody really knows how to finish a book! I can't help thinking that the final instalment will make up for the relatively minor issues I had with the other books.I stand by my review of Hater though, I think this would have made a near-perfect single novel. By splitting it into three, padding it out, muddying and diluting the messages, it loses a little credibility for me. Moody has some seriously big and important ideas that are hinted at throughout these books, and I would have loved for him to sharpen and hone this element of the books a little. Much as I appreciate straightforward narrative prose, I think the writing felt a little bit too lean even for me. I would have loved a few poetic phrases here and there to create a stronger mood. Don't get me wrong, the violence and horror elements are fantastic, but I think that with a little more finesse, they could have had a lot more impact. That's not to say there aren't some truly horrific scenes though -If the last part of this book doesn't punch you in the guts, I'd be very surprised!I have a bunch of questions jotted down about the plot, but I'm going to hold onto them until I finish the third book. If I've learned anything by now it's to trust Moody to finish things up well! And if I haven't made it clear enough to everyone, I DO recommend reading this trilogy, and I am SERIOUSLY looking forward to the final instalment....."}, {"userName": "David Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4353110-david-bradley", "userReview": "This is a weak follow-up to Moody's Hater, the first book in this series. What I loved about the first book was the main character's development arc -- how Danny reacted to a world going to hell, mostly by not reacting (until the end of that book). In this second book, the world is already hell, and remains hell. In the first book, the world changed, but Danny didn't, and it worked. In the second book, the world stays the same, but Danny's changes, and it flops. Problem is, the changes Danny undergoes don't make any sense. The plot twists don't make any sense either -- the mad scientist with initially ambiguous motivation comes to mind (how did he manage to fool so many people?).What I really loved about Hater was how Danny, the main character, was an everyman. He represented probably how most people would react to a \"rage virus zombie\" outbreak -- a bit of concern, but mostly just hoping the whole thing will blow over. In Dog Blood, Danny's special. He's got a skill that will help his side win the war. Suddenly he's important. Suddenly he's a character that matters to the world, not just to his family (and the reader). This is a big step back for the series, or at least for my enjoyment of the series. It was inevitable after the end of Hater -- how else could Danny have a plot line, given the ending of Hater, except to become important in the war? How else could the character and the world-building continue apace? But it is a shame.I would recommend this book to someone who liked Hater, liked the world Moody created, and wants to see it through to the end. Hopefully I'll be picking up the third book in the trilogy, Them or Us, and my perseverance will be rewarded."}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5680530-joanna", "userReview": "I really liked this book in the beginning. I enjoyed the way the author layed out the story on a day to day basis. Internal narrative of a person. Followed by the first person of the man character.The work interaction was funny, bringing back fond memories of office space and TP reports.The protagonists kids in the story were annoying and left me thinking they needed that nanny from the reality show. Then it just got boring. I can't say exactly when it happened, but it did. At some point what I was reading just wasn't interesting anymore and I found my mind wandering while sitting on the train thinking of twenty eight days later and how the book reminded me of it in a way. And then...nothing. The first person narration was repetitive and vanilla. Rushed and boring. I wanted more of what he was going through, more feeling, more anger? Just....more. Moody had the potential to write something interesting, engrossing, and fairly original, but he fell short of claiming that victory.When I finally reached the end of the book I was awakened from my doze and plowed through to the end, slightly annoyed with the author\u2019s explanation of the characters actions as \u201cjust because\u201d but otherwise content, I guess. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d pick up the next book and read it.

We got a taste of different factions; if you will; of Haters...or maybe, different levels of Hater-dom; not really sure how to describe it. I have the feeling that the children were much worse, than the adults. \"children have no memory of before, ...they are pure hate.\" We get really in depth with how our main character, Danny McCoyne; is adjusting and evolving as a Hater. This is why this book received 3.5 stars. I did not need to know his every waking thought or mood. At times it was a little too much. His flashbacks and thought processes, drove me nuts.

I really enjoyed this one as well, it didn't lose my interest and was just as good as the first, in my opinion. No vampires or zombies, just human monsters; but monsters nevertheless.

Our protagonist Danny is a \u2018Hater\u2019, a zombie who rampages across the countryside in search of his child: also a zombie. I use the word \u2018zombie\u2019 cautiously (it occurs only once in the book) for, although Haters have some zombie-like traits (they kill non-zombies indiscriminately) they are essentially normal individuals; they aren\u2019t \u2018undead\u2019; they will injure and die as humans; they are rational and caring towards their \u2018own\u2019; they have fears and doubts. While \u2018Dog Blood\u2019 is billed as a sequel to Moody\u2019s 2006 book (\u2018Hater\u2019) it reads as a standalone. I haven\u2019t read the first one, but will probably seek it out as I enjoyed this one. There are many references to the destruction of London so I assume that is the ground covered.When we first see the \u2018Haters\u2019 in action they are classic zombies. The \u2018Unchanged\u2019 (you and I) are conducting a sortie into danger zones for supplies and survivors when it goes wrong and they are surrounded and attacked. The Haters en masse behave just as classic zombies do and bloodshed ensues.Towards the end of this opening chapter we follow one of these killers (in the third person) as he stalks and brutally dispatches his quarry. In the next chapter we are surprised and somewhat horrified when the author changes perspective and the story proceeds (in the first person) as an account from behind the zombie\u2019s eyes. This marks the difficulty of the book. We are asked to identify with a relentless killer. Readers will naturally balk at this. However, once you see the zombie as your tribe you begin to view the Unchanged themselves as the real zombies. The book really illustrates what it is to identify with one type:- \u2018tribe\u2019, community\u2019, dare I say it: religion? Once you have successfully integrated you begin to view everyone outside as \u2018other\u2019, a potential threat. On one level \u2018Dog Blood\u2019 brilliantly illustrates the invidious nature of \u2018in group/ out-group\u2019 mentality and, as such, it is a powerful analogy for our times. There is an elephant in the room; the word \u2018jihadi\u2019 is, like the word \u2018zombie\u2019, only used once- but you notice it.We come to (partly) understand Danny\u2019s motivations. He was a caring, though stressed, father of 3 children. He knows that one of them, Ellis, (5 year old daughter) is a Hater like him and he embarks on a quest to find her. This will involve no tender scenes of reconciliation though- Ellis turns out to be even more murderous than her father.The Unchanged -the \u2018normal\u2019 people- can only tell the Haters apart by their murderous behaviour. The Haters, on the other hand, can tell if someone is of their tribe simply by looking at their face (they do have to see them- at one point in the darkness Danny doesn\u2019t know who he\u2019s talking to, pp130). This ability is never explained, just accepted. Danny: \u201cThey need DNA tests and records and the strength of our reactions to be able to see what we are. But we, on the other hand, simply sense them. We know what they are without a word being spoken.\u201d (pp 182)This being a sequel, the zombies are already here: Hate has arrived. We do, however, hear stories in flashback of the day it began. It seems Hate just took hold (not simultaneously, but over a short time). Some instantly became haters, others didn\u2019t: \u201cNo one knows why we\u2019re like we are, and why they\u2019re different\u201d (pp 125). Mark (the hapless Unchanged who is trying to hold his family unit together as refugees in a \u2018safe\u2019-zone) would give anything to return to his humdrum and unfulfilling prior life (pp.123). Danny, in contrast, feels ultimately fulfilled in his new life as a Hater and can\u2019t believe that he spent his old life doing such pointless stuff. Why do the Haters kill? \u201cWhat we do is instinctive.\u201d says Danny (pp.48). However there is an attempt to finesse what they do so naturally: their behaviour is generally referred to as \u2018fighting\u2019 and their object is \u2018war\u2019. Later (pp.151) Danny further rationalises his actions: \u201cWe had to kill them for protection; this whole war has been fought in self-defence\u201d There is an overall problem with the premise of this book: how can such rational actors assimilate their own irrational murderous actions. For all that the Haters can \u2018see\u2019 the difference between themselves and the Unchanged there is no physical distinction. But the difference is definitely not an ideological one either (even though at one point it is suggested that Unchanged children could be trained to become Haters- pp. 51) - the Haters get a sort of high feeling when they kill Unchanged which is likened to a drug habit; they don\u2019t want to convert the Unchanged, they just want to wipe them out; they have no compunction against killing their own families: \u201cIf they were the Unchanged, they had to die. Simple as that\u201d says Danny (pp.158)However Danny later becomes able to control his Hate and move freely among the Unchanged without feeling compelled to kill them. Here we are offered some hope that the cycle of destruction can be resolved- this is certainly the hope of the Unchanged therapist who guides Danny through the desensitizing process. But this is all dashed away when Danny, under the guidance of Sahota, uses his ability to infiltrate the Unchanged safe-zone as a member of a Hater fifth column. To the end Danny stays true to his Hater identity- he is fighting a war against the Unchanged and they must all die. This is undoubtedly heavy going and not a book for dislikers of gore- especially after we are introduced to the feral, terrifying, 5 year old Ellis, but the books pacing and sporadic humour make it exciting and strangely life-affirming. This is a book which confounds expectations and provokes some thought on the human condition. A very intelligent zombie novel and an antidote to \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019.

The country has descended further in to chaos as the Unchanged up the ante against the Haters and what could have been simply rinse and repeat (like the Autumn series) has an interesting quirk. Midpoint, by which point nothing has really happened, Dog Blood turns in to a scenario more akin to the military genre, where the concept (although never directly correlated) of Hater-terrorism emerges. The concept of sleeper cells in a 'zombie' novel is very astute of the author and although it never realises itself with any tension or memorable moments it is enough to save the novel.
