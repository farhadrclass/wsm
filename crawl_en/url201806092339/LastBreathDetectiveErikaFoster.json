How many authors have we read that begin to lose their mojo 3-4 books into their series? I'll admit to holding my breath before picking up book #3 in the series, Dark Water, as I knew we were getting to that pivotal moment, the one that shows if a series will stand the true test of time or become a flop like so many before it. I was so pleased and grateful when it turned out to be a 5 star read for myself, and once again found myself doubly pleased at how amazing book #4 was as well! If you haven't started the series yet, I would highly recommend going back and picking up the first book titled The Girl In The Ice and read them in order. While each book can be read as a stand alone, I would encourage you to put in the time to experience Erika and her crew from the beginning; there are so many little details and meaningful moments you'll miss out on otherwise.Sometimes I wonder if I'm demented for loving books as dark and twisted as this one is. What has enabled Bryndza to rapidly publish these books we are all clamoring for is the delicate balance he creates between graphic, thrilling content and personal, engaging moments with his characters in their private lives. I remember having an instant connection with a minor character named Isaac in the first installment and practically begged the author for more from him. Sure enough, the very next book brought him to the spotlight and gave us a deeper understanding of who he is and how he fits into the bigger picture. Rob has managed to do this in each book, bringing characters he could have very well left as background noise to the forefront of our thoughts; this is what has made him a 1-click author for me. You know, the ones you'll purchase anything they write just as long as their name is slapped on it? In fact, speaking of characterization, it's the main focus of this particular novel. Last Breath is by no means a whodunnit; we actually find out quite early on the who, with the method following shortly behind, and finally are revealed as to the why in the end. My point is, the plot is fantastic, thrilling, and expertly written, but it's not the show stopping feature that makes this an excellent read. In lieu of continuing to use a formula that could be considered a ritualistic pattern to the series, the author chose to go a different route and spice things up. Instead of making the focus on the cases and some big, unexpected twist, he chose to use this platform as a means to deepen our connections with the characters and forge a stronger bond to these fictional beings who are the reason our feelings are so emotionally connected to these stories. I can't say much, but many of the \"twists\" I found were involving the direction of the characters' lives; this was clearly a gamble well spent as it worked wholly in hooking any remaining part of my being that wasn't yet fully invested in this series.I'm sure you've seen my reviews for these books popping up on Goodreads over the past 18 months and thought Gee she loves these books WE GET IT! I implore you to give this series a chance if you enjoy this type of read and haven't yet done so. These are books that are easy to fly through; once you pick them up you simply can't put them down. The writing just continues to get stronger with each installment and I find myself having a serious book hangover upon completing each one. Highly, HIGHLY recommended to fans of crime fiction and police procedurals. Well done Rob and looking forward to #5!*Many thanks to the author and publisher for providing my copy via NetGalley; it was a pleasure to take part in the blog tour!"}, {"userName": "Mary Beth *Traveling Sister*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14233569-mary-beth-traveling-sister", "userReview": "I don't have enough stars to give out on this one. It deserves more than 5.This is the fourth book in the Detective Erika Foster Series set in London. I recommend to read this series in order. The books get better and better and are very addictive. I was jumping up and down with excitement when I got this copy from NetGalley. I just love this series and savor every minute when I read a book from this series.A young woman is found tortured in a dumpster. Erica Foster is one of the detectives first on the scene. She starts out working on her own since she is no longer working for the Murder Investigation Team. She is determined to be involved in the investigation at all cost and convinced that she can bring the murderer to justice. She does this by working out who the killer is and why he is targeting these women in this chilling series of murders.I really love the character development in this series. Erica Foster is still determined as ever. She is tough and stubborn. Her greatest struggles involve her inability to conform to authority and her apprehension at the growing intimacy with Peterson. Due to the loss of her husband she has built a very high wall around her but this high wall is starting to crumble down.I loved this one the best of the series. I felt it was a bit darker than the previous books and the killer really creeped me out. I loved the grittiness, the twists and turns. This one definitely is not for the faint of heart. Very gripping and hard to put down. I can't wait for the next book and hope that I don't have to wait to long.I want to thank Robert Bryndza, Netgalley and the publisher for the copy of this book in exchange for a honestreview."}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "Grab yourself a hot piece of pizza, a fresh cold beer, and Robert Bryndza\u2019s new novel and be prepared to escape into another non-stop, adrenaline-pumping, thrilling ride!LAST BREATH (Detective Erika Foster, #4) by ROBERT BRYNDZA is an action-packed, exciting, and a gripping suspenseful mystery/thriller that pulled me in right away and didn\u2019t let go once as the story races along at high-speed to the breathless and exhilarating ending. ROBERT BRYNDZA delivers another well-written read here with non-stop action, although some things are revealed to us early on it is the tone, the well-developed characters, and the storyline that grabs your attention. \u00a0I really liked all the characters and loved how Bryndza balanced their work and personal lives in this book. \u00a0I absolutely love Erika Foster as we see a little softer side to her in LAST BREATH but she is still that extremely likeable, interesting, entertaining, and strong character who is just as cutting and determined to get results.To sum it all up it was an entertaining, exciting, tense, fast-paced, and a quick read with a very satisfying ending.

And no surprise, this one is another huge 5-star winner.There is a murder in sentence one of the prologue and the action races on from there. Erika has been removed from the Murder Investigation Team and it\u2019s killing her. In typical Erika fashion, she manages to get herself situated as Senior Investigative Officer on the case with the privilege of handpicking her team. She of course selects Moss, Peterson, Crane, and John McGorry amongst others. I love these guys!The baddie is using social media to entrap beautiful women whom he tortures and then kills. We learn the identity of this person early on, enabling us to get into his head. I think this adds depth to the story and enhances the cat and mouse game between him and the police. Since we know \u201cwho done it\u201d, Mr. Bryndza is feeding his little clues to Erika and her colleagues, rather than to us, and he makes this work quite well. The suspense progressively ratchets up as the team races to catch the murderer before he kills yet another young woman. Erika keeps running into roadblocks from her superiors as she tries to expedite her hunt with some dodgy moves, making us sweat all the more. The last 25% of the book is a page burner and the finale is downright thrilling. I thought I was going to jump right out of my chair!As outstanding as the plot is, what I liked most was the further development of Erika\u2019s character. I liked her before, but now I really love her. I can\u2019t say she\u2019s mellowed out all that much, but she is letting in those she cares about a bit more, and we are finding out more about what makes her tick. It\u2019s also clear that though she can be impulsive and intentionally ignores some rules and orders, she does so because she passionately cares about the victims of the crimes she is investigating. The only thing that struck me as a bit off was how Erika could get away with some of the things she pulled off, especially in the beginning of the book. But that\u2019s the Erika I know and love so my 5-star rating stays intact.I blew through this book and am sad to have to wait for Mr. Bryndza to write the next installment. I would like to put in a plug for him to his publisher, Bookouture, and urge them to offer their client a 16-book deal like they put together for my beloved Angela Marsons. I know a lot of readers who would be overjoyed if that happened. The Erika Foster series is most highly recommended for all readers of crime fiction/thrillers. Start with book 1, The Girl in the Ice, unless you care little for character development. This series is much too brilliant to miss."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13427823-maureen", "userReview": "A strange thing happens when I begin a Robert Bryndza novel - two small voices vie for my attention. The first is insisting I have other more pressings things to attend to, and the second is demanding that I carry on reading regardless. No prizes for guessing which one wins!Detective Erika Foster is back in the Murder Investigation Team, but she's not there without a fight, she's had to grovel to get her place back on the team, and she's eager to get on with the latest case.A young woman is discovered brutally murdered in a dumpster, this beautiful girl has been tortured, and has numerous cuts and broken bones. Some of the cuts had started to heal before she was killed, suggesting that she'd been held for some days before her death.The killer is connecting with young attractive women via social media. His fake profile suggests that he's handsome, successful, and funny, but he's like a spider with a fly - simply waiting in the shadows for the right time to pounce!With Detective Erika Foster on the case we know we're in safe hands, this lady will stop at nothing to bring the bad guys to justice, and she quickly discovers a link to a murder committed a few months earlier. She still manages to upset her superiors in a way that no one else would dare, but it's always with the sole intention of solving a case, and if that means she ruffles a few feathers then so be it. Robert Bryndza has set the bar high yet again. This is a phenomenal read, there's action from page one, and basically it never stops! It's the kind of story that makes your heart race, and left me in danger of hyperventilating. It moves along at such a pace, it's exciting, scary, and something that won't be easily forgotten. We have such a well developed character too in Erika Foster. She's as abrasive as ever, but I think we got to see a slightly softer side to her this time around. A great storyline, well written, totally gripping. Gosh, what else can I say?

Start from the beginning of the series for the best possible experience. Highly recommended to fans of crime thrillers and badass women.Robert Bryndza never disappoints. This is another intense, well written, absorbing thriller with a main character we've gotten to know and love. She has grown and changed as the series goes on, and I'm very attached to her and several recurring characters that continue to feature in the novels. The mystery in this one was chilling. We find out who the culprit is far before Erika and her team do, and get glimpses into his demented mind. It'll make you think twice about what you share on social media, that's for sure. Erika tags along with Detective Peterson when he gets a call. It's a horrific sight: a badly beaten young woman dumped like rubbish in a dumpster. She immediately feels that urge to help, but it isn't her case. Her stubbornness and determination wins out, and she's transferred back to the murder investigation division. And it's lucky she was, because it's Erika that finds a link to a very similar murder from months before. Someone is snaring beautiful young women into his web and abducting and torturing them... and he's not going to stop.I was given an ARC of this book from Net Galley and Bookouture, thank you!

She's been given her old team back and the opportunity to bloodhound like never before. The murderer keeps ratcheting up the tallies with more missing young women. And Foster is not about to be kicked to the curb this time. Robert Bryndza reveals a bit of a transformation in his main character of DCI Erika Foster in this one. Still intensely fierce and a take-no-prisoners attitude, Erika vents her private nature in a different direction. \"It wasn't just the circumstances of the victims' deaths which haunted her, it was the lives that had been snuffed out prematurely.\" From the very first sentence, Bryndza sets the story at a rapid pace. Short, spirited chapters catapult the storyline from one breathless action to the next. Bryndza reveals the killer from the onset. We, the readers, snap on our seatbelts (and you're gonna need one) as Foster and her team get closer and closer. Just how is this person staying one step ahead of them?

Its called being a police detective. She can't let go of a case until she solves it. Even if its not her own. In Last Breath, by Robert Bryndza, women are connecting with the most amazing guy online. He seems funny, gorgeous and sexy .. and the women? They can't wait to meet him. And when that happens? He abducts them and holds them captive for days. Then he brutally murders them. When Detective Foster finds out about what appears to be the first murder, she's not even assigned to the Murder Team. She's on the Projects Team. But you know Foster.. she just can't help but insert herself and investigate. After all, she just wants to solve murders. Superintendent Sparks has other ideas however. There is bad blood between he and Foster. If only that was enough to keep Foster at bay. Luckily for her, Foster has Detectives Peterson and Moss to back her up and together, they make a great team. In a crazy stroke of events, Foster gets a spot on Murder and she, Peterson and Moss work to investigate the murders, which are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated. This guy stalks his victims. Preys on them and they are none the wiser. But you know Foster, she can't give up when trying to solve a case, even when faced with horrific danger. In Last Breath, the author Robert Bryndza, shows a new depth of character for Detective Erika Foster. She has become more vulnerable and is learning to open up to others, which she wasn't able to do in the prior books in this series. Her relationship with Peterson and Moss continue add layers of humanity to her, as does her relationship with best friend and confidant, Issac Strong. Her romantic relationship with Peterson progresses as well and we see a new side to Foster. Moss, funny as always, makes you laugh out loud and shows Foster how important good female friendships are. In my opinion, this is the best book in this series. The author, Robert Bryndza outdoes himself with each book and here, he kept me totally consumed by the storyline and the characters, whom I adore (murderers aside, of course!). This thriller is one I'd recommend to anyone who loves a good mystery/suspense. It can be read as a standalone, though I think that reading all of the books in the series gives you great insight into these fantastic characters.Thank you to NetGalley, Bookouture, Robert Bryndza for an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.Published on NetGalley and Goodreads on 3/19/17.*Will be Published on Amazon on 4/12/17."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "First and foremost, a large thank you to NetGalley, Robert Bryndza, and Bookouture for providing me with a copy of this book, which allows me to provide you with an unbiased review.I devoured the previous three novels in this series and could not get my hands on this latest piece fast enough. While family obligations slowed my completion of this book, this should not be indicative of my interest in the story or Bryndza's writing in general. As the story opens, DCI Erika Foster is still struggling with her assignment outside of the Murder Investigation Team (MIT), while making the most of still having a job. When a call comes to one of the MIT while Foster is present, they both head to the scene, where a young woman has been found murdered and left in the Dumpster. Quick to take charge, Foster tries to control the scene, only to be ordered away. This creates significant headaches for her later on, something with which Foster is only too familiar. Working leads on her own, Foster meets with a former colleague to pass along information, only to find herself in the middle of a harrowing medical emergency. Soon thereafter, Foster seeks and receives another secondment, giving her a chance to lead an MIT as they look for the killer. This one lurks in the shadows as he lures victims through social media, posing as a number of highly attractive men, which proves to be the opposite of his own appearance. The killer's distinctive crime pattern offers some insight for Foster and her MIT, though it will take more than apt police work to catch this cunning individual. As both Foster and the killer struggle with personal issues, it will be a game of cat and mouse until one makes an irreversible error. Another stunning read that will surely help reestablish the Bryndza conversation and leave a new round of fans scrambling to learn all about Erika Foster.Bryndza's effectiveness is not lost on me or the scores of others I know who rush to devour every book when they hit the market. Be it the wonderful cross-section of characters or how well they mesh together, the reader can fall in love with the character development alongside a powerful mystery. The narrative is strong and leaves the reader hanging and wanting to read 'just a little more', which is complemented by extremely quick chapters. This quick march through the story has the reader sitting for a period and seamlessly digesting large portions of the book, loving every nuance. The only downside to this is that when the 'high' of the story comes to an end, the reader is left crashing and begging for more. Bryndza has such a way with words, settings, and realistic depictions that anyone can read them and feel completely at ease. There is no geographic snobbery that the reader ought to know areas of London and environs to properly navigate through the story. Taking the time to offer an interesting argument about the pitfalls of social media, Bryndza's social commentary leaves the reader pondering their own online fingerprint and how dishonesty fuels privacy. Brilliant work again, though I am forced to bide my time and hope that there are a few more ideas percolating inside the author's mind as we speak.Kudos, Mr. Bryndza for yet another spectacular novel in this series. I find myself impatient, but highly excited what you have planned next for DCI Foster and the rest of the team. Thank you for entertaining so effectively with all you publish.Love/hate the review?

Erika has been shunted onto the Special Projects Team and she is understandably not happy. Things come to a head when she finds herself on the scene of a grisly discovery. A young woman, Lacey Greene, has been abducted, gruesomely tortured for days and murdered by having her femoral artery cut, then dumped as though she was trash. The serial killer's identity is no secret as we get his perspective and actions alongside the police investigation. Erika gets involved in the case and nothing is going to stop her getting on the Murder Investigation Team despite Superintendent Sparks opposition. Erika discovers connections with a previous murder with the same MO and finds herself as Senior Investigating Officer picking her team, as Sparks suffers a heart attack. The team struggle to identify the perpetrator, there seems to be no trace of him anywhere. This pushes Erika down unorthodox paths and facing problems with the police hierarchy. The killer is a hugely compelling dark and manipulative character who stalks his victims online on Social Media, slowly infiltrating their lives until they feel comfortable accepting a date with him. The multiple threads begin to eventually connect as Erika and her team race against time to find the serial killer in their efforts to ensure that no further women are endangered.This is a fantastic addition to a series that only seems to get better. There is development with Erika's character as she is more open to being vulnerable and opening up emotionally to her team and best friend. She is in a relationship with James Peterson which is going well. However, she is never going to be a sweetness and light person, she is going to do what she needs to do, and for that, her abrasive side can be a strength. This is a fast paced read with short chapters that utterly grips the reader. There is plenty of tension, twists and suspense.

Erika just cannot stay out of trouble. Still not able to get assigned back to a Murder Investigative Team, she is miserable in Projects Team. The book has barely started when she's butted in on someone else\u2019s murder crime scene and lands on Superintendent Spark\u2019s sh** list. Still, she's like a dog with a bone and refuses to stop looking into the case, even after a suspect is arrested. I found myself shaking my head at her tenacity. This is a woman who hardly has a life outside of her job. She consistently takes advantage of the few friends she has, such as Peterson and Strong. You know she's desperate when she's willing to apologize to Sparks. Bryndza does a wonderful job of painting this obsessed woman. This book is a definite page turner. From the beginning, you know who the killer is. But if anything, that just ratchets up the tension, as he is one depraved soul. Just an amazing series. Definitely add this book or the entire series to your TBR list. Thank heavens Mr. Bryndza is a fast writer because I\u2019m already anxious to read book five.My thanks to netgalley and Bookouture for an advance copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Dash fan ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61989809-dash-fan", "userReview": "5\u2606+\u00a0 Nail biting, Non stop thrillerLast Breath is the 4th book by Robert.However it was my first book and I absolutely LOVED IT!! I was hanging onto every word. It was captivating, scary, exciting, pulse racing, and highly addictive... you have been warned!What I loved most about this book was you found out who the killer was within the first half. Well in fact it was a little tease for all of a few pages when I was convinced it was someone else!Robert has restored my faith in Detective books. I was beginning to tire of them till I read Last Breath.Erika is the main character. She is the lead detective and I loved her!\u00a0She was strong, determined, charismatic, A fantastic leader, sometimes a little too strong minded as she got her self into trouble. But overall she was passionate about her job and I believe that is what made this book so great! The story took on a cat and mouse chase, early on in the story. The killer was extremely clever he knew every detail to the last letter/ cctv camera... well that was until he became sloppy and lost control.The killer had a very dark past and it is only at the end you come to realise he's torture and torment he faced growing up.My only wish was that he's back story had more exploration as it was equally as disturbing.It was extremely worrying how real this story could actually be. There are people out there who take on fake identities and lure innocent people. But it's to what cost...when does it become dangerous!! I would like to applaud Robert for a fantastic piece of writing. It was such a quick read and kept the reader gripped till the very end.I highly recommend this book to everyone. It was cleverly written and had a great female lead. It was fast paced and gripping. If you love exciting books with a great twist, a scary true to life enthralling crime thriller then this is Definetly one for you!

This is the 4th installment of the Detective Erika Foster series, and I'm happy to say that this one does not disappoint! Bryndza truly has a way with words. Not only has he created a strong yet at times vulnerable protagonist, he has surrounded her with a team of detectives that each have something to contribute to make the whole story come together. With each book he allows the reader to get to know Erika just a little bit better than the last book, but not 100%. She still has some secrets left to be revealed.He's also not afraid to get his hands dirty with violence, but it's never done in a way that makes you feel it was just for a reaction. These scenes are done incredibly well and used to draw the reader in, creating a mood and painting a picture of what's ahead. Each of his books have a main plot, but there are always side stories going on throughout. It's never too much or too distracting, and he provides the perfect amount of closure at the end so it all comes together seamlessly. I often find myself being very disappointed when I've read that last word...This particular story relies heavily on the use of social media, which I found incredibly fascinating. Not just in how the investigators use social media to assist them, but I was more disturbed by how it was used by the Killer. Creating a fake profile, friending people connected with the victim so when he finally reaches out, the victim feels safe to accept a friend request. Using social media to track their movements, establish a pattern. Getting their address and other personal information to help him plan. All so calculated, but so very real....It is just too easy to access this stuff, and it has really given me something to think about!!I did take off a half star for the final confrontation, as I felt there were some details that didn't ring true, and honestly I don't think were needed. But again these were minor.I'm looking forward to what Bryndza comes up with next for one of my top 5 leading police detectives.

I have followed this series from the beginning and it is proving to be a very rewarding series! The investigation was excellent and the characters keep getting better and better. Bryndza knows how to write crime thrillers well and how to scale up the tension and maintain the reader\u2019s interest.Someone is checking you out on the internet. Can you feel it? You\u2019ve actually met him once or twice but when you connect on social media, he's actually handsome, successful, and funny. He friends your friends, scrolls through your photos and learns all there is about you. He waits in the shadows until it\u2019s the right time to pounce!I loved the angle of this plot. Bryndza used the complexity of social media to base his killer on and it was fantastic.Erika Foster's character keeps getting better as the series continues. I love that she\u2019s still rankling superiors and speaking her mind. This is a woman who doesn\u2019t have a life outside of her job.

I was so looking forward to reading this that I feared I may have set myself up for slight disappointment but I needn't have worried. A young woman's body is found in a dumpster, brutally murdered and Detetcive Erika Foster is one of the first on the scene. The only problem is it isn't her case. She is immediately drawn to the case and fights tooth and nail to become part of the investigation. When she finally gets her way she quickly links the killing to a similar killing four months ago and fears there is a serial killer on the loose. Both women have been horrifically tortured for days before being killed, both in the exact same manner. As another young woman goes missing she faces a race against time to solve the case before more women are murdered. Our killer is finding and grooming his victims on social media. Posing as an attractive sporty young man he manipulates his victims into agreeing to meet with him for a date before kidnapping them and ultimately murdering them. Who is the real killer? How is he covering his tracks so well? He's like a ghost in the night. Untraceable online and nowhere to be seen on the numerous cctv cameras in London. Can Erika solve what seems an impossible case?Last Breath is another cracker of a book in the Erika Foster series. The story zips along as you are drawn straight into Erikas world again and indeed the serial killers. One of the things I really liked about this book was(and I don't think this is a spoiler) we the reader know who the killer is quite early on in the book. In fact we spend many chapters of the book with him, both in his \"normal\" life and his life as a serial killer. In fact Erika nearly takes a back seat in this one as the killer was the star of the show for me. That's not to say that she doesn't feature heavily and a hell of a lot happens to her again here apart from chasing the killer. It's just that the time spent with the killer is truly fascinating. It's also great fun knowing who the killer is, yet still reading and spending time with Erika and her team as they try to piece the scraps of evidence they have together to try and solve the case. I really love this series. Mr Bryndza really has a well established and beautifully written central character in Erika. The stories have been great, effortless reading and thoroughly satisfying, this one stands up to and is as good as, if not better than the predecessors. An easy five star review for me. I'm already looking forward to the next instalment of this series.

A possible serial killer on the loose. Unrest and a big shake-up in England's Bromley Police Department. And that's just for openers in this, the fourth in the author's series featuring Detective Erika Foster. What more could any mystery lover want?Nothing, says this mystery lover (and lover of this series in particular) - except possibly a few additional chapters to give me more time with my nose in these pages and/or a very short wait till the fifth installment is published. Meantime, I thank the publisher, via NetGalley, for the opportunity to read an advance review copy of this one.The beginning finds Erika in a sort of informal personal relationship with fellow police officer James Peterson and no longer working on the Murder Squad. But when the dead body of a woman who had been horribly tortured turns up in a dumpster, Erika wants her old job back so she can take the lead on the case. The powers that be aren't exactly hot to trot on the idea - Erika isn't known for mincing words - but after another surprise twist (and the discovery of a possible tie-in with an eerily similar murder a few months earlier), her wish is granted, at least temporarily.All the investigative team can figure out is that the killer apparently is stalking his victims online and using an online dating service to lure them to him. Finding who and where he is, though, proves far more difficult; even learning the color and make of his car isn't much help - it's one of the most popular in all of England.The story moves along quickly, and I love how new bits of information on the characters are worked in as the action becomes more complex and exciting (I finished the last quarter of the book nonstop just because I was totally wrapped up in what was happening). I couldn't wait to get to the end but didn't want it to end, if you know what I mean.I know reviewers aren't supposed to use quotes from advance copies without checking them against the published version. But I've noticed what may be a trend, especially among British authors, to work in a reference or two to the current political situation here in the States. This won't appear on my review at Amazon after the book is released, but it's just too good to not mention here (I'll also say it is my fervent hope that it makes the final cut). As one police department character questions whether to allude to a serial killer in a news conference, the response is this:\"...I think there's enough other crap happening in the media right now. People are more concerned with who is President of the USA.

It's a sure fire HIT! Sorry for the caps, but they're beyond deserved. Robert Bryndza, you are in a league all your own now. I have my favourite authors but sometimes even their titles sometimes disappoint somewhere. You just don't, no matter a half star here or there.

A badly beaten, blood-soaked body is discovered in a dumpster. Detective Chief Inspector Erika Foster arrives to assess the scene \u2013 but it\u2019s not her case. You know those tee shirts with the slogan that reads, \u201cPlays well with others\u201d? Foster most certainly doesn\u2019t own one. Detective Foster has a way of stepping on toes and raising the hackles of her superior officers. Why? She considers the victims and their families first and foremost above official boundaries or office politics, and she tends to lack a filter on her mouth. This does not endear her to her boss, but her team of Moss, Peterson, Crane, and John McGorry are as loyal and dedicated as they come.Needless to say, Erika does manage to worm her way into the investigation and gets to handpick her team, choosing the aforementioned group. Whatever she may lack in her personal or social relationships, she more than compensates for in her crime-solving instincts, and she feels comfortable with her team, so that makes her even better. Before long, Erika\u2019s crew uncovers a previous murder with striking similarities, and now she fears that the killer may strike again. Through hours of tedious work poring over CCTV footage, pounding the pavement talking to possible witnesses, and weeding through the victims\u2019 phone and computer records, the police piece together the perpetrator\u2019s modus operandi: he is stalking his victims online by friending them on Facebook using a false identity.But we know all this because Mr. Bryndza has shown us the killer. He\u2019s an ordinary guy with an ordinary life. He happens to have a very evil, sick need to abduct, torture, and kill young women. There is an irony to this. He is angry because of his rejection by women who consider him to be plain and unattractive, yet he himself makes the same judgments about women. There is quite a dysfunctional family dynamic as well. He is a tormented soul. Bryndza does a masterful job building tension as the media attention increases and the killer senses that he is running out of time. We can feel him escalating toward a breaking point, which spells danger for his next victim as well as for Erika and her team.Last Breath is the fourth book of the Erika Foster series. If you haven\u2019t read any of these books, I\u2019d recommend starting with the first, The Girl In The Ice. It\u2019s wonderful to see the progression of the characters, particular DCI Foster, throughout this series. By the time we\u2019ve reached number four, Erika still misses her late husband, but she is moving forward. She is now dating one of her fellow police officers. While it is true that she too often fires off harsh, angry words, usually directed at superior officers, she is now able to soften them and apologize, even take a nibble or two of humble pie for the sake of getting along. She is who she is, but she is starting to be more forgiving, perhaps even of herself. She may find that difficult heading into book five, given how this one ends. I look forward to diving into that one \u2013 providing it doesn\u2019t involve dumpsters!5 stars"}, {"userName": "Petra", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28393395-petra", "userReview": "This is book 4 in the London-based police procedural series about DCI Erika Foster and my favourite. I know I said the same for book 3, sorry. Ideally, these should be read in order starting with The Girl In The Ice. There is a lot of personal development happening and I think the relationships between various characters can be appreciated more with all the background. In this one, Erika barges in on a murder case where young women are abducted, tortured and then left in dumpsters. The identity of the killer is revealed early but it didn't make this any less enjoyable because I found the chapters from the killer's perspective totally gripping albeit unnerving. The killer's exploitation of social media and online information was fascinating to follow but disturbing. The balance between developments in Erika's personal life and the focus on the investigation was perfect. I wasn't fully on board with the path Erika's personal life was taking in the previous book, Dark Water, but I loved the way it all developed here. The scenes between Moss, Petersen and Erika provide a welcome relief from the darker passages. Having learned from previous mishaps, I started this on a day when I knew I'd be able to get through to the end without having to stop. The short chapters and fast pace encourage you to keep reading. I switched between reading and listening to the audible version. The narration wasn't outstanding - more differentiation and work on the accents would have been nice - but as I got further and further into it, I was so consumed by what was happening in the story, the tone of the narration became insignificant.
