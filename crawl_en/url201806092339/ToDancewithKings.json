A good friend of mine (whose opinion I seriously respect) has been recommending I read this book for YEARS. I finally borrowed it and I have to say, I'm a little underwhelmed.Like most have written, the concept of this book is brilliant: following four generations of women through Versailles. The problem is the execution. I couldn't really get invested in any of their stories and Laker's writing is really awful. I like a trashy romance as much as the next person, but I found myself rolling my eyes. That being said, this isn't your typical trashy romance. Laker obviously did her research and must have been incredibly passionate about the story. But if I read the would \"sumptious\" or \"he knew her better than she knew herself\" one more time I might light myself on fire.Various characters were interesting though, and the beauty of this book is in the details. I would have liked a little more involvement from the main women and something - anything - to relate to. So read if this is your genre, but for those of you who don't usually do historical romance, there are significantly better books out there to scratch that itch ;-)"}, {"userName": "Marita", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17415449-marita", "userReview": "The blurb on the back cover of this novel proclaims: \"An epic generational tale of loves lost, promises kept, dreams broken, and monarchies shattered, To Dance with Kings is a story of passion and priviledge, humble beginnings and limitless ambition.\" It pretty much sums it up.The historical romance genre does not have much appeal for me, and I wasn't sure that I would like this book, but there are redeeming features such as the wealth of historical detail which sweeps us through the magnificent court of Louis XIV right through to the horror of the Revolution. It was obviously very well researched and the plot is well developed and resolved. There are interesting characters (not all likeable!) and dialogue, and I chuckled at the encounter between Ath\u00e9na\u00efs de Montespan and Fran\u00e7oise de Maintenon as they meet on a stairway, one ascending and one descending:\"Neatly Fran\u00e7oise began to ascend the staircase.

I do. Emma, Gone With the Wind, The Once and Future King - all long books, and all among my favorites (well, GWtW isn't, but I do really like it). The reason I bought this one was because it was long and it looked silly and it would admirably fill a few long summer days.Not really.It's a multi-generational story, but what this really means is that it would be ten times better as a series of four books. Violette, from what I can see (third generation), is basically skipped over so we can get right to Rose. All four generations (Marguerite, then Jasmin, then Violette, then Rose) of women are really the same - impetuous, passionate, beautiful, all that stuff. After Marguerite - who I managed to finish reading about by sheer force of will, because she REALLY ticked me off - and halfway through Jasmin, I just couldn't keep going. I skipped through and I pretty much know what happens.At one point there's a four-page (note: these pages have about four hundred and fifty words on them; most books have at most three hundred and twenty-five) soliloquy on the part of Louis XIV; at the end of these sixteen hundred words we find out that he's still pissed at the madwoman who shouted at him twelve years ago.

Based on the length of the novel and the cover, I really did not look forward to reading this book. I however am doing a reading challenge and needed to read something about the 17th century. I did not expect what an amazing story this was. It is a multi-generational story starting in the 1600s in France and ending with the original character's great-great granddaughter during the French Revolution in the 1700s. The novel had romance but it was more historical fiction. You would think that with so many generations the characters might get confusing but that was not the case.

This sweeping saga chronicles the rise and fall of Versialles, spanning four generations of women from the one family, Marguerite, Jasmin, Violette and Rose, all of whose destinies are entwined with those of their monarchs.Rosalind Laker's superb imagery and historical accuracy bring 17th & 18th century France to life. From the architectural detail of the Palace of Versailles, the rich colour of changing court fashion, the art of fan-making, the persecution of the Heugenots (Protestants) & the lavishness of court in direct contrast to the plight of the peasants.In 1664 hundreds of nobles descend on the village of Versailles to pay court to the sun king, King Louis XIV. Augustine Roussier witnesses the birth of a peasant fan maker's daughter and christens her Marguerite promising the mother that he will return for Marguerite on her seventeenth birthday ...and so the story begins.\"Marguerite becomes part of the royal court of the Sun King, but her fairytale existence is torn out from under her by a change of political winds. Jasmin, Marguerite\u2019s daughter, is born to the life of privilege her grandmother dreamed of, but tempts fate by daring to catch the eye of the king. Violette, Marguerite\u2019s granddaughter, is drawn to the nefarious side of life among the nobles at Versailles. And Rose, Violette\u2019s daughter, becomes a lady-in-waiting and confidante to Marie Antoinette.\"My small criticism of 'To Dance with Kings'- this is quite a lengthy book & Laker devotes very little time to Violette's character which I found a little disappointing considering her attention to detail with the other characters. However I loved her most sympathetic & to me, more honest portrayal of Marie Antoinette. I was completely enthralled & touched by the Queen's intelligence, courage & love & appalled at the use of her initial extravagant & carefree behaviour as a scapegoat for the King's failings. Don't expect this to be a quick read, it is however well worth the time. This beautiful story is a definite keeper for my historical fiction shelf."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332895-lori", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this novel!!!

Jeanne is a peasant woman whose chance meeting with 4 musketeers in the village of Versailles on the day of her daughter's birth makes her dream for an aristocratic life for her daughter she would have never thought possible before. Marguerite, Jeanne's daughter, becomes caught up in the Sun King's court at Versailles and begins a passionate love affair which changing political tides cut short. Jasmin, Marguerite's daughter, leads a charmed life until she catches the eye of Louis XV and is banished from court. Violette, Jasmin's daughter, has a rebellious streak that leads her to the dark underworld of Versailles. Finally, Rose, Violette's daughter, as Marie Antoinette's lady-in-waiting finds herself caught up in the violence and terror of the French Revolution. This book was the kind of historical epic that I very much enjoy. There are many real-life main characters, including: the kings Louis XIV, Louis XV, and Louis XVI, their consorts, mistresses, and enemies. The Palace of Versailles plays a large role in the book almost as a main character itself. The book follows it beginning with it's transformation from a rarely used hunting chateau to the premier royal residence in Europe to its downfall in the revolution. The rooms are described with such vivid detail that you almost feel you are there. Then there are the women themselves which are who the book focuses on. They are very well-drawn and it is very easy to get swept away with their stories. You feel their tragedies and triumphs, their great romances and great losses. I did not really have a favorite among them, I loved reading about all. They were all quite fascinating. The big thing I disliked about this book was that Violette got no attention at all in the book. It was like she was just there to bridge a gap. I think her story would have been just as fascinating as the other women yet you only see her at birth and young adulthood. The other women are followed from the beginning of life to the end. You only get hints of what Violette was up to during her absences from the story, the whole story would have been nicer. It's not a huge detraction from the book, but it did leave me a bit disappointed. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes big historical epics, especially if they are interested in French royalty or the Palace of Versailles.

That\u2019s fine with me, since as a lover of historical fiction, I\u2019m happy to read something new and eventful, even if it\u2019s not necessarily what I signed up for in the first place.However, I will say I do not think this book was for me. While fairly well-written and based on a clever premise, even this novel, set in one of my favorite time periods, failed to enrapture me in the way I wish it could have.To Dance with Kings follows multiple generations of women, which is something not many books I read do. If anything, this was the novel that turned me off from multi-generational stories, because even though I found myself somewhat interested in the first story, it all went downhill from there.Jasmin already began to irk me, and so by the time I got to Violette, I found myself utterly relieved Laker barely covered her life. At that point, I simply did not care about yet another woman in this family free, and what we did see of Violette merely proved my point even more. To that point, Rose was fine, but she had little to draw me in and redeem the previous two women I laboriously read about when my interest was already waning.On a more complimentary note, Laker certainly did her research, and the settings, as well as the various points of contention, were likely my favorite parts of the novel. Though those usually play very important roles in books and can easily make or break a book, I am usually a very character-focused reader, and so it was a bit of a disappointment to me that I couldn\u2019t seem to really root for any of them and prefered just to take in the other aspects.While this book was not for me, and so I am hesitant to recommend it, I would say that for someone who loves multi-generational stories (even when some generations get hard to love), historical fiction, and France, this could make for an enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/832784-kristen", "userReview": "This was a long, fairly engrossing book, and I learned a lot about the lead-in to the French Revolution, and the Revolution itself, by reading it. I didn't know a ton about French history going into this, so that was interesting. I found the different generations of women to be a little too similar for my tastes--I felt like they weren't individual enough as characters--but I did find the arcs of their stories to be satisfying and realistic. My biggest gripe with this book was the extreme violence against women that it portrayed. I know that it is historically accurate, but it's just something I, as a reader, find really hard to read, and hard to make it through. If you are less sensitive to this, then you may be able to connect to this book more than I did.

The characters all seemed to blend together: when the women were young, they all had the same characteristics. As they got older, they all matured into a different set of same characteristics. Many actions and reactions seemed slightly off -- some from their historical counterparts (like Marie Antoinette) and some just from general human behavior. And the various romances and relationships never seemed to have any foundation, and therefore always felt rushed and flat. Overall, none of the people in the book ever really felt human for me, which is a pity, because the idea of following 4 generations of women through Versailles is fascinating. The execution was just a little underwhelming.Recommended if you like French pre-revolutionary history, but not enthusiastically."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2556799-debbie", "userReview": "phewww....glad to be done with it!!

It effectively depicts the roles and plight of women at the time, and the history is very interesting. Although the novel is engaging and I wanted to keep reading to know 'what happens next?,' I wasn't clear on the 'what am I reading for?' part. When I read a book, I need to know why I keep reading. Is it to know what happens to the main character? Is it to know if love conquers all, etc.? In this case, reading about one generation after the next often left me wondering when the story would be done. Would it be when the last descendant died? It's by reading reviews while reading the novel that I realized the true \"story\" was about Versailles and would end with its fall in the late 1700s.

Once this promised courtship began however, the story really became interesting as the political undercurrents flowed around the couple and their subsequent generations.
