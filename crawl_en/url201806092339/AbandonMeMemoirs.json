{"ratings": 765, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "I thought maybe the book title was being nice and giving me a little hint, that it was saying \u201cabandon me.\u201d Believe me, I thought about it. But here\u2019s why I stayed put:-One reviewer said it was sort of like The Chronology of Water (it wasn\u2019t).-I wanted to see if it would get any better (it didn\u2019t).-It had tons of gushy reviews at the beginning of the book (I don\u2019t get it).-The language was sometimes seductive. So let\u2019s go with the positive here. Yes, the language is amazing--lyrical and intense. Some of the time, in fact, I was just mesmerized. Febos speaks frankly of longing, jealousy, and trust, which pulled me in. And she has some interesting insights, though honestly, I don\u2019t think I could appreciate them because a lot of the time I was annoyed. CUT. Uh oh, this is one of THOSE reviews--where I\u2019ve finished the book and feel all huffy. Complaint City is about to open its gates. Then I open the book again to check out a quote, and damn! Beauteous language and keen insights stare me in the face and draw me in. So why did I start out bashing this book?Okay, true confession (man, you\u2019re probably considering me totally unreliable now!): My book buddy hated this book. This is just all wrong--we usually have the exact same reaction to a book. So I kept trying to hate it; I wanted to be like her. Meanwhile, she was doing the same thing--trying to like it, trying to be like me. This led to some funny discussions where we struggled to agree (didn\u2019t happen) and we ended up laughing hysterically. Since we aren\u2019t in seventh grade, we finally realized that it\u2019s okay, we don\u2019t have to try to see the book through each other\u2019s eyes\u2014because it just doesn\u2019t work that way. Taste is a weird bird.So now that I have that confession over with, off I go to the Complaint Board. My biggest complaint is that Febos would pour out her heart in one paragraph, and then start a factual discussion in the next. Literature, history, Jungian psychology, myths, philosophy, religion, facts about Indian tribes\u2014she threw it all in. The facts diluted the emotion and almost became comical. Here\u2019s an example of sequential paragraphs: \u201cBlack hair wet against her forehead, she smiled at me, touched my face with her hot hand.The Catholic monks of Opus Dei, like their thirteenth-century predecessors, practice self-flagellation in prayer. In India, Pakistan, Iraq, and Iran, some Shiites march in parades, practicing their versions\u2014zanjeer zani and tatbir. . . . \u201dWhat???? Foreign words I\u2019ll never remember, religious history I couldn\u2019t care less about. What happened to the intimate moment she was just describing? And that pedantic paragraph went on and on. It drove me crazy! Febos does eventually get back to making it relate to her story, but it\u2019s a long road back. Once she even had a footnote. Seriously, footnotes do not belong in a memoir. The book reminded me of Solnit\u2019s The Faraway Nearby, but Solnit gets away with the digressions a little better. I think that\u2019s because Solnit\u2019s work was advertised as a book of essays, with some memoir thrown in, whereas here, Febos\u2019s work is called a memoir, so the grad-school lectures are more annoying. I did complain about this in Faraway Nearby, so I\u2019m an equal-opportunity complainer. But I think I misspoke when I said earlier that Febos was pouring her heart out, because a lot of the time she sounded stilted and detached, which doesn\u2019t go with heart pouring. When she did write with emotion, it often seemed melodramatic, like she was going for effect. The word pretentious comes to mind. Yes, there were times I was impressed by her honesty, but that was overshadowed by the lectures. The academic detours had the effect of taking me out of her story, which made it harder to understand her or empathize with her. Perhaps she included them as a way to distance herself from emotion, which is anti-memoir in my opinion.Note that reviewers actually liked this style. One reviewer said this:\u201cFebos exposes the complications of identity, addiction, obsession, jealousy, forgiveness, trust, and abandonment\u2014weaving into each scenario mythological, psychological, and literal interpretations.\u201dAnd another said this:\u201cBut the truly special moments are when Febos is exploring her relationship with her father(s) or ruminating on favorite books, the beauty and nuance of language, philosophy, native culture, and the meaning of home.\u201dIf combining emotional confessions with academic lectures appeals to you, you might very well find this a good read, because the language is indeed good. You can tell that Febos is one smart cookie. Based on the pre-release reviews, I predict I\u2019ll be in the minority here. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this one doesn\u2019t become big-time popular.I wasn\u2019t crazy about the choices Febos made, and I didn\u2019t understand where she was coming from all the time. Although it\u2019s the book and not her life that I\u2019m reviewing, these factors kept me from getting into her story more. As I said in my initial short review, I\u2019m going to stick to what I know is true: Stay away from memoirs by unknowns. Her seductive language is the only thing that kept this from 2-star-land.Thanks to NetGalley for the advance copy."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Just the title of Melissa Febos memoir...left me with questions. I understood the subject: ABANDONMENT.....but \"Abandon Me\".... depending on how it's said -and framed can have different meanings. I can't remember-specifically reading a book about the affects of abandonment- yet my father died when I was 4 and my mother often left me home alone at night starting at the of 5 -- so I was very interested in Melissa's memoir in which she include stories about her childhood. As I read through the stories I noticed a pattern -- Melissa craved comfort. The things that pained her couldn't be soothed by speaking. Rage about being rejected was turned inward. As abandonment progressed , it burrowed deep within where it silently was eating away at her self-esteem. Desires to consume grew.... to fill her emptiness. Lust was a desire. Chronic insecurity became the scourge of her human relationships. Fear became a barrier at attempts to find love.And like many abandoned people-- Melissa defended bruises by a lover: it was a feeling of being owned. Melissa said: \"As much as we like to own, we also like to be owned in love. Or at least to belong to someone. I am a feminist, and the desire to be possessed is one I have been reluctant to admit\". Melissa's writing is real- raw - emotional. Books were of tremendous value to her growing up. The Captain, who raised her, ( Melissa's first father left), gave her treasures rather than religion....and he gave her stories. We learn quite a lot about Melissa's life... 'everything... from drugs. Sex, changes in her appearance, i.e. Clothes, hair color, music, her family, ( her brother's bipolar disorder), the secrecy and self absorption and greedy need Melissa had to protect only herself...and the addiction than ran through her family. It's got to take so much courage to write a book like this.... because even if Melissa has achieved more emotional balance and inner peace today-- which God Bless her - I hope she has -- and it sounds like she has --to write about old pains -old memories... she would have to feel them again to have manifested emotional integrity such as she did. Melissa created meaning from some crazy chaotic situations. Thank You Bloomsbury, NetGalley, and Melissa Febos,"}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "I dislike writing negative reviews, in particular for memoirs, because I know firsthand how much vulnerability goes into this brave, brutal genre. And I appreciated Melissa Febos's vulnerability in Abandon Me, as she describes lust, love, loss, and a gamut of other emotions in a raw and honest way throughout the book. Her essay \"Labyrinths\" slayed me with its intricate discussion of family, mental illness, and the importance of saving oneself.However, I did not appreciate the glorification of the unhealthy and toxic romantic relationship in Abandon Me. Though some may use words like \"passionate\" or \"exhilarating\" to describe the romance that pervades this book, I would characterize it as emotional abuse (for further reading, check out this short piece by Cheryl Strayed on the same topic.) For the entire duration of this book, I waited for Febos to describe how she broke free from this abusive dynamic, or at least for her to indicate an awareness that this type of behavior should not be normalized. However, she ends her book by writing \"every lover is a destroyer... I had to be destroyed to become something else.\" As someone who has experienced both unhealthy and healthy relationships, I would argue that, actually, a lot of loving relationships heal instead of destroy, and you do not have to necessarily be destroyed to find yourself.Overall, I wish I had liked this one more, but the imprecise language and the lack of structure, coherency, and greater unifying message tired me out. I do wish Febos the best and I hope that readers who enjoy this book take away the message they should try to prevent or seek help for the more abusive behaviors present within its pages. For those who want intense, intelligent, and compassionate personal essays or memoirs, I would recommend \nAppetites\n by Caroline Knapp, as well as \nThe Empathy Exams\n by Leslie Jamison, just to name a couple."}, {"userName": "Bree Hill", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26896300-bree-hill", "userReview": "Something about this book I just found incredible.

You can\u2019t be. But I was hungry. For food, for approval, for secrets, for my legs\u2019 push against the ground, for the ocean, for words. For none of these things at all., but for the brief satisfaction of filling myself with them.\u201dWhat do we all have in common when it comes to love, regardless of our sexual preferences? It devours us, picks it\u2019s teeth clean with our bones! It makes fools of us as we wait for returns when abandoned, a god/goddess when adored, vengeful when burned but most of all we are hungry for it, our mouths forever open for more! It isn\u2019t any easier if you\u2019re gay, or young, or rich\u2026 what stupid things to say. Love is a wound sometimes too. Melissa Febos opens her soul to the reader, purging emotions and thoughts that we can all relate to. You should read it whether you are male, female, gay, straight, foreign, alien\u2026 you get it. Love, this greedy hungry creature, where does it rise from within us, how does our upbringing prepare or damage us for future partners.This is how one woman makes sense of her upside down heart, her compulsion to both eat and spit out love, you know- that compulsion that drives us all into the arms of someone, hoping to fill, be filled and at the same time emptied out. Love is insane, our childhoods are insane\u2026 how the heck do we survive it all? As Melissa writes about her father (The Captain) and her mother\u2019s seperation, his \u2018stepping away from them\u2019, it is poignant how it also her own love story in a sense. We take the beginings of our own story, which starts with our parents, and build a skeleton with it, on which we add our future and what a home it is! She rebels, she experiments, she stumbles and on and on she goes, as we all do.Beautiful writing dripping with raw emotion, salt in wounds words. Yes, yes\u2026 me too! I have felt that, I have done that, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s you! From the quote I shared at the start of this review- \u201cyou\u2019re not even hungry\u201d we are always hungry! Our past is never completely behind us, every single person that we love or learn about love from we carry on our backs, we all need to be the adored and to adore. Love shifts, things end, and falling in love is both an ascension to heaven and a sacrifice to some terrifying demon. As Melisa Febos says \u201cThough a clumsy child, I was a scrupulous keeper of secrets.\u201d And lucky for us that is true, because what are memoirs really but a divulging of secrets, be they thoughts or stories that live inside our minds?

I appreciated so much of it but the writing didn't carry me through. Or it felt redundant. Or it was the wrong time for me to read it. Anyway, when I found an ARC of Abandon Me I was intrigued but not keeling over with excitement. I started the book that night and we were inseparable for days -- until literally minutes ago when I turned the last page. I fucked this book UP with underlining and circling and star-ing and exclamation point-ing and DOUBLE and TRIPLE and QUADRUPLE underlining and square-ing whole paragraphs, accentuated with stars. I read it on the train and walking up stairs and walking home from the train, having to lean the book against a lamppost to underline and exclamation point some more. I told my roommates about it. I told my co-workers about it. I would have told people on the train about it but that's \"inappropriate.\" The writing is vast. Have you read Lidia Yuknavitch's (eternally brilliant) Chronology of Water? It hit me like that. Except Yuknavitch's story is woven beautifully but the story was not mine. I found myself again and again and again in the pages of Abandon Me. I offered to let my roommate read the copy but now it's so marked up I'm not sure anyone else would want to. I read this book until it was 2am and my eyes couldn't anymore -- do you know how long it's been since that's happened? Since I thought about book wistfully when I couldn't be reading it?Is anyone still reading this? Probably not. Probably you're all going to your locally-owned small bookstore and pre-ordering this book. You should. Especially if: you self-identify as a woman, you're any variation of queer, you've ever loved a woman, you've ever been in a co-dependent and emotionally abusive relationship, you were birthed by a woman, you have a brother, you have an addiction, you live and / or love New York City, you have indigenous heritage, you are not enough of something, you are too much. This book makes me feel like maybe I don't ever need to find my biological dad. Like becoming my worst self with my ex fiance was the best thing I could have ever done for this moment, so many hundreds of days in the future. Like the man who acted like my father is the most benevolent gift this life has offered me. Like I should be in New Mexico or leaned back in a tattoo parlor. Like there is a way to tell our stories, that there is worth in everything we've left behind.I can't wait for my roommate to read this book so that I can have it back and read it again. Until then I'm going back to Whip Smart to try it again. I already miss Abandon Me.If you haven't read The Chronology of Water pick that up, too, while you're pre-ordering this one. (Sidenote: I gave it a 4 because if MF can leap from Whip Smart to Abandon Me, I cannot truly conceive of what's next - but whatever it is, I want to leave space for her next genius)XOO"}, {"userName": "Ilana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3201683-ilana", "userReview": "Electrifying, gut-wrenching, painful, gorgeous, personal...

It\u2019s so beautiful that I can not find a single thing to criticize.It is also DRIPPING with sex.In fact, most of the negative reviews on Goodreads say something like \u201cWhy does this book have to be so sexual?\u201d Um, guys, you picked a book by dominatrix\u2026did you expect something G rated?This isn\u2019t so much about her time as a sex worker\u2013that\u2019s another book\u2013but about every other loaded section of her life. As she puts it:\u201cI am Puerto Rican, but not really. Indian, but not really. Gay, but not really. Adopted, but not really.\u201dThe memoir\u2019s story follows her abusive relationship with a married woman and her constant struggle to escape it. She details her addiction to self-harm, then alcohol, then drugs, and then love\u2013all in an effort to gain control over her own body. We get to know, some along with her, the heartbreakingly damaged people in her life.But the most important point of this book is how she teaches us of the incredible psychological trauma of the Indigenous Peoples of America. At one point, she has a conversation with her agent about how no one wants to read about Native Americans, that she should write something more akin to her dominatrix book, something about her\u2013urban and edgy. So she does just that with this book\u2013writing her love story, but still managing to weave in Native American history in every stop that is made, and let us know just how that genocide and erasure has affected the people we have tried so hard to push down.Prove that agent wrong. Order this book immediately, guys. It\u2019s sexy, it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s IMPORTANT. There are LGBTQIA+ and Native and POC people everywhere in this. And you know, that agent is right about one thing\u2013we don\u2019t see too many Native American authors\u2013but that shouldn\u2019t mean a lack of wanting them published.

Febos comes up with wonderful, provocative similes and images and insightful, hard-hitting truths time and again throughout the book, which is kind of unbelievable. There were so many times when I felt compelled to write down quotations. I did feel like the last piece, which takes up about the last half the book and is about her destructive long-distance relationship with a woman and connecting with her Wampanoag birth father, felt unwieldy. I saw some connections in the stories, but I didn't see why she didn't divide them into two essays. It felt a bit jarring to move between the two narratives while reading without compelling connections to explain why they were being told together. Still, I highly recommend this book. I'll be thinking about it for a long time, I think. Some of my favourite quotations are: \u201cEvery story begins with an unraveling. This story starts with a kiss. Her mouth the soft nail on which my life snagged, and tore open.\u201d\u201cMaybe that\u2019s all bravery is: when your hunger is greater than your fear.\u201d\u201cLove is so often a wish to have our wants seen and met, without our having to ask.\u201d\u201cTenderness toward the object of our desire becomes an expression of love partly, I think, because it so defies the nature of want, whose instinct is often less to cuddle than to crush.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Sian Lile-Pastore", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3281164-sian-lile-pastore", "userReview": "I feel a bit mixed about this one.

I wasn't really sure what it was about (other than a memoir), but it's also about depression and addiction and a toxic relationship, and I just felt it had a general underlying feeling of grief, depression and despair that I found difficult to deal with. Just before I read this, Michael Stone (yoga teacher and amazing writer) died from a drug overdose relating to his bi-polar and I'd been reading quite a lot about that and him (whose writing and insights I love) so this kinda all seeped into the book for me.... And I wasn't having a great time. So if I'd have read it at another time maybe I would have liked it more? But also, there were things I liked lots - I liked the style, I liked the stuff she was saying, I was interested in her heritage - how she'd never really known her real father but had his tastes and mannerisms (like eating pancakes with butter and salt), I liked the stuff about her adoptive father who is a sea captain, her feelings of trying to fit in (her father is Native American), her feelings of abandonment.

It\u2019s an involuntary abandonment, however, because I would love to keep reading her words. Her insights about her life have profoundly resonated with my own. I took my time reading this book, savoring it slowly and allowing her reflections to sink in. Febos explores how abandonment has played a part in her life through relationships with her biological father, her stepfather, her beloved Amaia, and even with her own self, at the times when she was out of control. Febos opens up her soul and takes a long, hard look at the gaping wounds inside, dissecting her feelings, understanding her behaviors, and pinpointing with raw vulnerability, honesty, and very precise vocabulary, the source of the darkness within. By pointing at her own darkness, she made me conscious of mine. Throughout the book, Febos intertwines stories about her passionate but unhealthy relationship with Amaia, with sketches from her family and her family history. In the process, she also references authors, poets, and concepts of mythology, history, and psychology. I was particularly fascinated with the Greek symbol of the Ouroboros, a snake shaped like a circle, with its head biting its tail. Febos cites Jung\u2019s description of the Ouroboros as a figure that \u201cslays himself and brings himself to life, fertilizes himself and gives birth to himself. He symbolizes the One, who proceeds from the clash of opposites\". I found this symbol so interesting, I researched it further, scouring the internet for more information. (I personally dislike tattoos, but if I ever were to get one, I decided I could easily wear this symbol, as it embodies many ideas I have about myself).My copy of this book \u2013a wonderful, autographed gift from a friend\u2013 is now full of ink, underlined and scribbled everywhere, highlighting many of its brilliant words.

I got bored very quickly and just powered my way through to see if it got any better.

I found the first three themes to be the most interesting and compelling and felt like the sections on her Native American heritage might be mined later and better in a future book.The author weaves these themes together with chapter lengths getting shorter and shorter toward the end, leading to a hard-beating rhythm that you expect will break into a crescendo at the end. I found myself hungry to tackle the next chapter.The author does a great job digging into the depths of heart ache and communicating in a way that connected with me. At times, she likes to discuss psychology literature and research and I felt like at those times, this seemed to take away from the almost visceral and emotional connection that her more personal material had."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3848603-mary", "userReview": "read this on the porch in Telluride where I folded corner after corner & made this poem out of someone else's story:\nWe knew so little of what we wanted. We had yet to ask anything from each other but possibility, and thus so little to lose.I know the power of being wanted. It is balm for the fear of being left.The work of love is in building a shared story, and in letting the differences in perception rest easily aside one another. Every story begins with an unraveling. This story starts with a kiss. Her mouth the soft nail on which my life snagged, and tore open.The fear that I was following a stranger through my life, and that stranger was me.It is easier to have insight about the past, when you decide to look at it. A list of the future is just a wish.In my twenties I lived with a man for three years who never laughed at my jokes, never picked up the thread and unraveled it with me, never reached the punchline that was more body than words, a giddy orgasm shuddering through us.

It's meaty and deals with race, identity, addiction, family, and the unraveling of a romance, in a way that feels natural, is sometimes really beautiful and haunting, and is always interesting. The way this book is put together mystifies me a bit, though -- the first half is made up of a handful of personal essays, each somewhere between 5-25 pages long, most (or all?) of which have been previously published elsewhere, and then the 2nd half is \"Abandon me,\" which (I assume) was written for this collection and is about 170 pages. The first essays were all good, but they started to feel a bit repetitive, as they kept looping back to the same stories/ideas that she would later tell in greater detail and more linearly in the final one, so I'm not sure why she didn't incorporate some ideas from them into \"Abandon me\" and just make that the whole book. I'd still definitely recommend the book, though -- it never lost my interest and the writing was lovely and certain passages will stick with me for a long time."}, {"userName": "Maureen Stanton", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1554889-maureen-stanton", "userReview": "Febos's writing is beautiful and powerful, though strangely I found this memoir not affecting, perhaps because so much of the story is told through metaphor (after metaphor)-- abstraction that sometimes is untethered from the concrete so the meaning is diffused. The book has a strange structure that could easily have been fixed, with a few shorter essayistic memoirish works up front, and the second half of the book a long 50 (or so) part memoir. Why not unify them? Nevertheless, the writing is lovely, the voice authentic and unflinching."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2665693-laura", "userReview": "Sweet heavens not for the faint of heart! this is a tightly woven memoir that kept me on a razors edge the entire time.

First, her birth father, who left her with only an inheritance of addiction and Native American blood, its meaning a mystery. As Febos tentatively reconnects, she sees how both these lineages manifest in her own life, marked by compulsion and an instinct for self-erasure. Meanwhile, she remains closely tied to the sea captain who raised her, his parenting ardent but intermittent as his work took him away for months at a time. Woven throughout is the hypnotic story of an all-consuming, long-distance love affair with a woman, marked equally by worship and withdrawal. In visceral, erotic prose, Febos captures their mutual abandonment to passion and obsession -- and the terror and exhilaration of losing herself in another.At once a fearlessly vulnerable memoir and an incisive investigation of art, love, and identity, Abandon Me draws on childhood stories, religion, psychology, mythology, popular culture, and the intimacies of one writer's life to reveal intellectual and emotional truths that feel startlingly universal.", "title": "Abandon Me: Memoirs", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30038917-abandon-me", "average": 4.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1483093345l/30038917.jpg", "reviews": 129, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2979647.Melissa_Febos", "name": "Melissa Febos"}], "type": ["Autobiography", "Nonfiction", "Writing", "Lgbt", "Glbt"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30038917-abandon-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31862638-abandon-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6926832-whip-smart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36381618-girlhood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623890-goodbye-to-all-that", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10676388-crush", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13615544-the-beautiful-anthology"]}
