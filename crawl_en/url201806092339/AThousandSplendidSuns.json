For starters, I bought the book at an airport in Taiwan, which meant it didn't have a due date which meant it took a backseat to many books that I didn't have the luxury of reading whenever.Additionally, because I've heard so much about this book already, I almost didn't want to read it at all. I've heard that it's depressing, that it's not as good as The Kite Runner, and that it's basically a novel about the brutal treatment of women in Afghanistan.You know when you read a book or see a film that has had great reviews and you finish feeling disappointed because it didn't live up to the hype? My experience reading this book was the complete opposite. I loved it. I didn't feel the message of the book was one of brutality or depression, but of hope and the toughness of the human spirit.There are plenty of awful scenes to lend credence to its reputation. While the story's time frame spans thirty years, the main focus of the novel are two woman, a generation apart, whose lives cross as they become the wives of the same man, Rasheed. The elder, Mariam, was born to a servant woman out of wedlock and is raised in banishment, ignorance and eventual rejection during the years the Afghani government was controlled by the communists. She finds herself forced to marry a much older man after her mother commits suicide. Laila, fifteen years younger and raised by intellectual parents, enters the marriage under much different circumstances. Alone after a bomb destroys her home and kills her parents, and pregnant by her childhood love who has fled the country, she marries Rasheed in a desperate attempt to save her unborn child.The writing engrossed me. Much like the Kite Runner, Hosseini magically puts the reader in the city, neighborhood and house of his characters. Much to his credit, I found myself torn between wanting to yell at Laila to hush up, so that she'd avoid another beating, and kicking Rasheed myself, because he is a despicable brute.Mariam, one of the most tragic characters in literature, makes this book what it is; a story of love and strenghth. She, who didn't have an easy day in her life, allows herself to be touched by the love of Laila and her children. In return, she performs the ultimate act of love and saves a family.I appreciate Hosseini's portrayal of a part of the world that is under so much scrutiny lately. Afghanistan, and the city of Kabul where the story takes place, have a long history of wars and occupations which result in a great chasm between different ethnic tribes, Islam, economic classes and gender. Hosseini uses this novel to tell the story of Afghani women and the hardships that face them with each regime change.As a woman, I feel blessed to have been given confidence and opportunities. I truly cannot imagine what it would be like to live under the conditions the women in this book live under. I am grateful to be born to the family I was born to and in a country which allows me to live the kind of life I choose.Miram and Laila didn't have the opportunities or support that I have. And yet they survived. They endured and they reached out to others, despite their circumstances. In this, Hosseini redeems all of Afghanistan by showing these two women's humanity. He shows that in a place whose beauty was written about in a 17th century poem, where \"One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs and the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls\" is a city that can become illuminated once again."}, {"userName": "Anu", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/163152-anu", "userReview": "August 2007I was riding in a cab in Bombay recently, and a bookseller on foot approached me at a traffic light with a stack of books. I did my best not to look at the boy, but I couldn't help it. He was waving several books in my face and something caught my eye. I thought my glance was discreet, but he saw me look.. and it was game over. The light turned green right then and the boy starts running with the cab yelling 'Memsahib! Memsahib!'. We're picking up speed.. I'm so scared he's going to get his foot runover so I grab whatever I could from my wallet and somehow get it into his hands. In return he tosses a random book at me through the window as he's getting further & further away from the cab. I look to see what I ended up with. It was A Thousand Splendid Suns, which I was planning on buying anyways. The cab driver asked me how much I ended up giving the boy. 'A hundred and fifty rupees,' I said, which is barely $4. The cab driver says in return, 'You paid a hundred rupees too much!'. Hardly, I thought to myself. That boy worked his butt off. The best part is because the book is bootlegged it's full of typos and random fonts. Love it. In case I ever discuss the book with you and my recollection of the story is completely different from what you read, you'll know why.January 2008Read the book on my way to Vietnam a few days ago. Loved it, although it was missing a few pages here and there :). Coincidentally, the friend I'm traveling with brought the same book on our trip so I had access to the missing pages. (And another coincidence - our Mekong Delta guide was carrying a copy of the Kite Runner. We were like some sort of Hosseini fanclub floating down the Mekong in our longboat...haha). I have a few thoughts on this book, I'll write them out in more detail soon. I'm heading back to Bombay in a few days...maybe I'll run into another bookseller on foot :)."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "[\n Mariam wished for so much in those final moments. Yet as she closed her eyes, it was not regret any longer but a sensation of abundant peace that washed over her. She thought of her entry into this world, the harami child of a lowly villager, an unintended thing, a pitiable, regrettable accident. A weed. And yet she was leaving the world as a woman who had loved and been loved back. She was leaving it as a friend, a companion, a guardian. A mother. A person of consequence at last. No. It was not so bad, Mariam thought, that she should die this way. Not so bad. This was a legitimate end to a life of illegitimate belongings.\n\n(hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4695-daniel", "userReview": "It's apparently becoming something of a tradition for me to trash books that are not only widely loved and praised, but were specifically recommended to me by friends. Khaled Hosseini's \"A Thousand Splended Suns,\" I'm sorry to say, is going to get the same treatment. (Forgive me, Rose.) \"Splendid Suns\" has been so widely read by this point, I won't bother recounting the story, and instead simply list my objections:- Hosseini seems incapable of creating characters with much depth to them. E.M. Forster, in \"Aspects of the Novel,\" talks about books having round characters and flat characters, with round ones being more like people you'd encounter in the real world, and flat ones being more of caricatures used to move a book's story along. The only character in \"Splendid Suns\" who approaches roundness, and he's a relatively minor character, is Mariam's father, Jalil. Everyone else is either a villain without any positive traits (Rasheed) or a hero who can do almost no wrong (Laila, Tariq, Mullah Faizullah). Even when Hosseini is depicting a child who has every right to behave badly given his circumstances (Zalmai), he can't help but depict the child as almost evil. The New York Times review of \"Splendid Suns\" said Hosseini \"creates characters who have the simplicity and primary-colored emotions of people in a fairy tale or fable.\" That's pretty generous of the New York Times. I'd say Hosseini may not be able to create three-dimensional characters.- While I appreciate Hosseini's attempt to teach a few decades of Afghan history -- a history few readers likely know in much detail -- grafting that history onto the story of one family makes for a rather creaky novel. To impart the history, Hosseini goes back and forth between giving the history through third-person narration, in Wikipedia-like prose, and putting it in his characers' mouths via dialogue -- dialogue often spoken to people who would already know the history. As a result, you sometimes get characters saying things like, \"As you know, the Taliban forces men to grow their beards long and women to wear burkas.\" The cut-and-paste history lessons make the novel painful to read at times.- Hosseini routinely uses \"harami\" (bastard) and other words from the characters' native languages in his dialogue, followed by the English translation, apparently in an attempt to bring readers closer to the Afghan culture. But it usually feels incredibly superficial, especially when the words being used aren't foreign concepts, but rather basic words -- \"brother,\" \"sister\" and the like. Hosseini and his editors also seem to forget about the trope, and cut back on the use of the foreign words in the book's later chapters. I wish they had done the same throughout the book.- The relationship between Mariam and Laila feels completely artificial. Mariam's initial hate for and jealousy of Laila never feels remotely justified, especially given how awful her husband Rasheed is anyhow, and their coming together later feels rushed and unrealistic. Even after they form a friendship, they never seem to grow quite close enough to fully explain why Laila misses Mariam so much towards the novel's conclusion. Hosseini fails to lay the groundwork needed to justify Laila's emotions in the novel's last chapters.- Almost the entire book is unrelentingly bleak. Don't get me wrong, I understand Afghanistan wasn't exactly Disneyland over the past few decades, but I think there were more lighthearted moments in the Book of Job than in \"Splendid Suns.\" I don't mind reading a depressing novel, but Jesus. Reading \"Splendid Suns,\" I kept thinking of that old workplace poster: \"The beatings will continue until morale improves.\"I didn't completely hate \"Splendid Suns\" -- the story moved along nicely, and it gave me a little more insight into a culture I probably should know more about -- but I don't think I'll be following this one with \"The Kite Runner.\" Khaled Hosseini probably doesn't need me as a reader, though. It seems he has plenty of fans."}, {"userName": "Hend", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7313087-hend", "userReview": "I have never cried while reading a book,like I Did while reading this one!It is the story of poor, uneducated women who have to endure the hardships of life...

I felt certain that a combination of sightseeing and the people I was with would keep me from having much time to read, but I packed a book anyway just in case there was time for a chapter or two in between stops. A Thousand Splendid Suns happened to be that book. And at the end of the day, when I staggered off that boat, blinking at my sudden exposure to reality, it wasn't because I'd been mesmerised by the stunning architecture and history lessons, no, it was because Hosseini stomped all over my heart and had me tearing through pages like a madwoman. I'm not even sure how I found enough hours in the day to take a boat trip around Montenegro and read this entire novel, but somehow I finished this in the few hours I had... simply because I had to.My initial reaction was a furious, teary promise to myself that I would have to give this book five stars - I think it's impossible for the mind to win a battle with the heart in that level of heat, especially when you're used to English weather. But afterwards, I managed to reclaim some of my sense and sanity, which is when I finally began to acknowledge this book's limitations. For one thing, I think it's extremely generous to place this book in the \"literary fiction\" category when I'm not so sure it belongs there. Please be aware, I am not complaining and I am certainly not a book snob, give me a delicious page-turner over some pretentious waffle any day. But I find myself comparing A Thousand Splendid Suns to another book about a country, culture and history I was only vaguely familiar with - The Poisonwood Bible - a book which I also read on my trip. The latter is a far more complex, ambitious work that brings something which, to me, felt entirely fresh and original. Hosseini's story, on the other hand, is not groundbreaking and I recognise many of the scenes and characters from other books - The Color Purple is the one which first came to mind.What it is though, or was at least for me, is incredibly emotional, sad, uplifting, infuriating and memorable. It's lessons on the history of Afghanistan and the rise of the Taliban might be basic but they are nothing if not compelling. I came away feeling like I learned something, which it is always a pleasure to say. What I did learn was truly horrifying, it painted details into the very vague images I already had in my mind that I had got from various British newspapers. But I also really liked the affection for his birth country that shines through Hosseini's story, his faith in the ultimate goodness of these people who witnessed society and order crumbling around them.The ultimate tragedy of this story, for me, is how everything could have been very different for Mariam and Laila if people had just acted a little faster, stopped worrying about their pride a little earlier, and trusted a little more. I really liked the range of emotions both women experienced and they way the author showed this. I know some readers thought it was wrong for Mariam to be jealous of Laila at first, that her jealousy didn't make sense, but I actually really liked that complex level of emotion that goes beyond what we would expect. Rasheed may be a bastard but he was the only thing in the world that she had at that point and on some level it made sense to me that she would want to claim him for herself.While I believe Mariam and Laila experienced complex emotions and were well-developed, Rasheed did not get the same treatment - a fact which I'm torn about. On the one hand, I think Rasheed would have been a better character with greater development beyond him being the most villainous villain of all villaindom. On the other hand, I think Rasheed's evil personality offers an important distinction between him and Jalil (and the other men), one which is needed in a book that looks at the cruelties women suffer at the hands of men. The difference between Rasheed and Jalil is important, the latter is a man who acts badly because his behaviour is shaped by the society he lives in and, because of that, he lets Mariam down when she needs him most. Rasheed, on the other hand, is a mean and violent brute who completely abuses the power handed to him as a man in this society. These differences between Rasheed, Jalil and the other men (Tariq, Laila's dad, etc.) show there is not one type of man in this society, that wife-beating is not simply a part of the culture, that even in a patriarchal society you can choose what type of man you want to be.I admit this is far from a perfect book, but it is a good book. It's a book that seems to swallow you whole but spit you back out in pieces. And, just to mention, I keep intending to read The Kite Runner again because I think studying it at school ruined it for me, but so far, I much prefer A Thousand Splendid Suns."}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k", "userReview": "To my editor:Khaled here. As I was reviewing my final draft of \u201cA Thousand Splendid Suns,\u201d some questions occurred to me.1. Could I make the characters any less complex? Despite my efforts, I feel I haven\u2019t fully achieved the one-dimensionality my readers seemed to love in \u201cThe Kite Runner.\u201d Specifically, I\u2019m afraid I may have given Rassan one or two potentially sympathetic moments early on despite his overall abusive personality (although I more than make up for it).

storytelling. A friend of mine said that Suns is a metaphor for Afghanistan but I found it illustrative of Afghanistan's weary and violent history; I found it brutally educational. When I had studied in Germany in 1987, I lived in an international dormitory. I asked my neighbor, Hyder, where he was from, he leaned in to me with a devilish grin and hissed \u201cAfghanistan!\u201d While others found this amusing, the effect was completely lost on me; I had no perspective at the time and was completely clueless of both international and domestic politics.Although not as gripping and revelatory as Kit Runner, this novel certainly packs punches that will knock the literary wind out of you. Khaled tells us the story of two women and their struggles for life in a society that thinks they should not live. What I find ironic about such societies is the obvious struggle between valuing women as life givers while depleting their worth because they are not men. What I love about Suns is that Khaled does not once point out the obvious sociopolitical conundrums of these ridiculous and ill-founded attitudes. Khaled tells these women's story and leaves the reader to wince, tear up and sigh; one time I had to catch my breath.I really enjoy Mr. Housseini\u2019s transportive narrative and I was entirely engulfed in the lives of his characters. Of late, I often take the train with my new commuting-buddy Maria and her 2 year old daughter Vivian. One morning as I sat next to Maria, Vivian began to relieve a peanut butter english muffin sandwich of it\u2019s contents. I took out Suns and began reading while Vivian took to her task with muted satisfaction. I closed the book. I just could not process the grim and dire passage I had begun reading the night before with the delighted consumption of the eviscerated contents of homemade love."}, {"userName": "Ahmed Ibrahim",

"userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "I started this book with high expectations. I had been overwhelmed with every conceivable emotion when I read the \u201cKite Runner\u201d and just couldn\u2019t believe that his second book, \u201cA Thousand Splendid Suns\u201d, could possibly be as good.So it was with trepidation and yet excitement that I read this book. I had left the last dozen or so pages to read until the following morning, as I didn\u2019t want to quite let it go, and as I sat there at 7 a.m. on the terrace, with a cup of coffee in my hand, I slowly finished the book. I breathed in deeply on reading the final sentence and looked down the valley, past the foothills at the Pic d\u2019Anie, part of the magnificent Pyrenean mountain chain. The sun would be rising over the hills within the hour as I looked in the direction of Afghanistan, wondering how many Moslems had already prayed that morning in the mosques, with their prayer mats facing towards Makkah in Saudi Arabia.This book was an extraordinary, contemporary, social document covering Afghan history from before the Soviet war until after the Taliban rule. The violence that ensued from this period in time resulted in the inevitable violence towards women. I abhor any form of violence and live in fear what will happen should another war occur. To see in what low-esteem and contempt the average Afghan viewed women, especially the Taliban, quite shocked me, and yet I \u201clived and breathed\u201d this book. Women were worth nothing.I think the reason this book had such a profound effect on me was due to living in Saudi Arabia for sixteen years and I could relate to a certain extent to what the women had to endure. Under the Qur\u2019an, men were entitled to have up to four wives, and they were supposed to treat them all equally. Then a man could just arbitrarily state \u201cI divorce thee\u201d three times and that was the end of the marriage. Many women were just cast out from the family home and led a miserable existence begging on the streets. What was remarkable about these women, however, was their instinct for survival and they still managed to laugh and joke. The author\u2019s own words were concise and to the point of life in Afghanistan at that time:\u201cFor almost three decades now, the Afghan refugee crisis has been one of the most severe around the globe. War, hunger, anarchy and oppression forced millions of people\u2026\u2026to abandon their homes and flee Afghanistan to settle in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.\u201dThe book is basically the powerful story of two women, Mariam and Laila, whose lives become indelibly linked because of three men: Jalil, Tariq and Rasheed.Mariam was the illegitimate daughter of Jalil, living with her mother Nana in an isolated place outside of Herat. She really loves her father and decides that she wishes to live with him instead of her mother, with disastrous consequences; the upshot being that Mariam is forced to become the wife of Rasheed in Kabul.Laila is a good childhood friend of Tariq and they finally fall in love with far reaching results when Tariq leaves with his family for Pakistan. Laila, who\u2019s a great survivor, and philosophical, as is Mariam, then becomes Rasheed\u2019s wife.For the two women, life with Rasheed becomes a living hell. I kept on thinking, I just want something really evil to happen to this despicable creature (I have worse thoughts than that but best to keep quiet on that and not write them down).In reality Tariq, the childhood friend of Laila, is the catalyst in the book. I really admired him, he was my favorite character, and he was brilliantly portrayed.The writing style is simple as far as I\u2019m concerned and there is an over excess of violence. However, the attention for detail is remarkable and this runs throughout the book: When Laila is recovering at Rasheed\u2019s home after a bomb attack, Mariam sees a complete and utter change in her husband. He becomes unusually kind and gentle, and he is seen to be courting Laila.The humiliation of both Mariam and Laila at having to wear the burqa, thus putting them into insignificance to the outside world; the husband being the only person allowed to look upon their faces.The incident when Rasheed \u201cmakes love\u201d to Laila for the first time. She to all intents and purposes is a virgin. She has a knife, cuts her finger and leaves some blood on the bed under where they were sleeping.Laila cooking a rather bad meal for Rasheed and the end results with the stones.Laila, Mariam and Rasheed with the shovel. This nearly blew my mind.Mariam in jail, refusing to see anyone, and then her journey to the football stadium. I had the most incredible feeling of time just stopping at this point and had great difficulty in turning the page. But then this happened to me on innumerable occasions throughout this wonderful book.I\u2019m always intrigued with the titles of books and this one was no exception. This originated from a poem written by Saib-e-Tabrizi in the 17th century and is quoted by Laila\u2019s father Babi when the family had decided to leave Kabul. He could, however, only remember these two lines:\u201cOne could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.\u201dI just absolutely loved this book. However, I\u2019m not happy having purely the Kindle version and so I\u2019ve ordered the hardback. I still get more pleasure from a book.And I have Khaled Hosseini\u2019s third book to look forward to in a few months: \u201cAnd the Mountains Echoed\u201d. Can this be even better? Is that possible? Yes!"}, {"userName": "Luffy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy", "userReview": "I didn't know whether to keep on reading or DNF this book. I didn't know if I should give it 5 stars or 2. The thing is, I cannot abide extreme hardship, pain, and suffering on behalf of the characters that are in the books I read.I'm certain that this is to be the last book I'd read this year. And what a book did it prove to be! The mind reels at the barbarism that can be eked from such perverted ways of thinking. Reason, rationality are out of the window.I know I haven't mentioned the plot or who appears in the book, but I cannot. I cannot summarize this book. I need to read one of my favorite non fiction writers posthaste. I must forget the rawness of A Thousand Splendid Suns. The latter reads like a horrible documentary. I must dull the sadness in me.

This is my favorite type of story that slowly weaves its threads and develops a narrative over generations, and just when you think all of the ends are tied up, it comes full circle and punches you in the gut all over again. This book is just as empowering as it is tragic, and Hosseini is just masterful at storytelling at this magnificent scope. The writing is gorgeous without being longwinded, the characters are so exquisitely fleshed out. It's also one of those rare books that's pretty melancholy throughout the duration of the book, but something about getting to the ending just really brought out the floodworks and i'm sitting here typing this review lookin like that one mindy kaling meme. Hosseini's books have all proven tremendous and if you're intimidated but still want to try them out, I would recommend this on audio!

Why do we keep on reading about these hellish landscapes where humanity is long dead? Maybe it\u2019s just the devil within, that makes many of us stop and stare at road accidents; maybe there is a cathartic effect, showing us that however bad things are, they could be worse. Or maybe it is the fascination of watching the human spirit soar above the inhuman universe. Most probably, it is a combination of all three.Taliban-ruled Afghanistan is a dystopia with a difference: instead of being hatched in the brain of some gifted writer, it is one which existed, very near to us in time and space. For the second time, Khaled Hosseini trains his spotlight on his unfortunate home country-however, whereas in The Kite Runner it was only a plot device for the protagonist\u2019s personal redemptive journey, here it is one of the main characters, this land of A Thousand Splendid Suns.This novel is the story of two women, and through them, Woman in general; as she exists and endures in most parts of the world. Marginalised, a vagina in her youth, a womb in her womanhood, and a pair of hands for sweeping and cleaning in her old age. Created by God as an afterthought as a playmate to His star creation which He made in His own image.Mariam is a harami, born on the other side of the blanket to the wealthy Jalil Khan and his housekeeper Nana. Nana accepts the fact they are outcasts, while Mariam doesn\u2019t. She demands her share of her father\u2019s love, which he is ready to give on the sly \u2013 the problem is, she wants it publicly. Her insistence on visiting her father at his town house ends in her mother\u2019s suicide. Orphaned Mariam, an embarrassment to her father and his three wives, is married off at fifteen to Rasheed, an elderly widower\u2026 with whom she endures a loveless and abusive marriage. She is also an object of shame to him because she consistently fails in carrying a baby to term.Laila is better off as far as family is concerned \u2013 she has an educated and loving father, a mother who is much more considerate than many others (even though she is slowly on her way to madness because of her missing sons who have gone off to fight the Soviets), and a charming friend, the one-legged Tariq, who is fast becoming much more than a friends as the children mature. However, her world slowly starts to unravel as Afghanistan\u2019s war with the USSR is won and then the various resistance groups starts fighting among themselves. One of her best friends meets a horrible death, another friend is married off, and Tariq leaves for Pakistan with his family. Ironically, when her family finally decides to move to Pakistan, a stray missile lands on her home killing both her parents. The injured Laila is taken in by Rasheed; with ulterior motives, it is soon revealed. However, she has no option but to become the second wife of the lecherous old man as she is carrying Tariq\u2019s illegitimate child: and the news of Tariq\u2019s death has come from across the border.As Afghanistan moves through the Civil war era to the Taliban era, the two women, initially hostile, form a bond. The bond is strengthened when Laila gives birth to a girl and loses glamour in the eyes of Rasheed, making her a fellow-sufferer with Mariam: and Mariam simply loves Aziza, Laila\u2019s daughter, all the more because she is a little harami like herself!Things slowly spiral to a climax when Tariq returns. It seems the story of his death has been manufactured by Rasheed. In a climax slightly reminiscent of a Hindi movie in the best Bollywood tradition, Mariam puts paid to her brute of a husband with a garden shovel, as he is trying to strangle Laila. Laila escapes with Tariq and her children, while Mariam confesses to her crime and receives the Taliban\u2019s swift and brutal justice.In the last part, we find Laila returning to the Taliban-exorcised Afghanistan, where she makes a pilgrimage to Mariam\u2019s birthplace and unexpectedly receives the money left for Mariam by her repentant father. With it, she revives the orphanage and school where Aziza had been given shelter during the worst years of her life. We leave the story with the news of her third child growing inside her \u2013 whose name is already fixed (we can all guess what it will be!), should it turn out to be a girl.  *Khaled Hosseini is definitely not a literary writer. His style is emotional: the story is given all importance, not the way it is delivered. There were complaints (rather justified, IMO) about the lack of dimension of the characters, especially the villain, in The Kite Runner: Hosseini was accused of playing up to the gallery by vilifying the Islamic world for the benefit of a largely Western audience. In hindsight, I have to reluctantly agree, even though I loved that book.A Thousand Splendid Suns is slightly better in the sense that all the characters are better drawn. The Taliban are shown as human beings, even though believers in a barbarian philosophy. Rasheed is unabashedly evil, however: but that has nothing to do with religion or geography \u2013 SOB\u2019s like him are a dime to dozen in almost all third-world countries. However, the women protagonists are well-etched. Thankfully, they fight back even when the dice is loaded against them.The novel follows a beaten path: there are very few surprises. The narrative structure is linear, and the author does not challenge the reader at any time within the narrative. The result is a story which flows at breakneck pace, loaded with emotion. We root for the good guys and boo the bad guys at all the appropriate places. And in the end, when Mariam cracks open Rasheed\u2019s skull, we stand up and applaud. But I do not care if the emotion is cheap \u2013 I thoroughly enjoyed it. One needs to load up on junk food now and then!The most noteworthy thing about A Thousand Splendid Suns is the way Afghanistan is portrayed: one weeps for the destruction of a beautiful country, gang-raped and mutilated by hordes and hordes of marauders. One wishes that the current tenuous peace holds, so that she can get back on her feet. *Once a taxi driver here talked to me about his family back in Pakistan, on the hilly borderland near Afghanistan. These areas are still outside the police scanner and largely controlled by the Taliban. He told me how his brilliant daughter was forced out of school by armed men on pain of death. He had wanted to make her a doctor, and now she was confined to sooty pots and pans in the backyard. The poor man was almost in tears.I remembered him when Mariam brought down the shovel the second time on Rasheed\u2019s head. She was striking a blow for the taxi-driver\u2019s daughter: and all such women, crushed under the iron boot of tradition which gives them existence only as man\u2019s playthings and possessions.You are fearsome: yet I bow to you, O Mother.Edit to add:I think she has to be here."}, {"userName": "\u064a\u0627\u0633\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u062b\u0627\u0628\u062a", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2013",

A novel that deserves to be read and re-read.I first read A Thousand Splendid Suns in 2010 and was so moved by the story of Marian and Laila that I planned on re-reading it within a year but the best laid plans and all that.....Finally came up in an online book group read and just couldnt wait to read it again to see would I react the say way as I did seven years ago.A Thousand Splendid Suns is an incredible chronicle of thirty years of Afghan history and a deeply moving story of family, friendship, faith, and the salvation to be found in love. An amazing sense of time and place along with memorable likeable and dislikable characters and a plot that is educational and emotionally draining makes this novel the incredible read that it is and the reason for my 5 Star rating in 2010 and again in 2017.While I remembered most of the characters and the story line, it was still a great read second time around and knowing that the discussion with the group would be lively and challenging added an extra bonus to reading this for a second time.A compelling and heartbreaking story that stays with you long after you finish the novel and this is one book that makes me thankful for the life I was born into.A wonderful read and a book that everyone should read at least once."}, {"userName": "Aj the Ravenous Reader", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30248594-aj-the-ravenous-reader", "userReview": "At 15, while I was still playing jack stones or watching Japanese anime, the girls in the story perpetually worried that any day they would be given away to some stranger in marriage. While I complained about the heat during bedtime, these girls feared they would wake up tomorrow without a home and a family or worse, would not wake up altogether. What hurt me most is the thought that although the characters and settings may be fictional, the events in the entire story did take place in Afghanistan and may still be taking place in other places around the world. Call me selfish, but the story made me appreciate my life even more.It is a heart-wrenching yet inspiring story that haunted me for days but from the very bottom of my heart, I thank the Mr. Khaled Hosseini for his unrivaled bravery and generosity for writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, a story about a woman\u2019s strength, resilience and will to have a place in a society of endless wars and conflicts and where laws and social rules seem to conspire against her. This is a story that shows how a woman can be beaten, spit on or even stoned to death and yet her spirit and faith won\u2019t waver. She will continue to fight for the ones she loves without complaint and will continue to weep and bleed for the love of her country.  I love how the lens of the story starts by zooming in on a small village, on one small character whose role in society seems of least significance and then zooms out onto the bigger picture, showing the conflicts in the country as a whole and how in the end, the small character will mark a huge place in the society. Even though this was one of my saddest, heaviest reads this year, I still look forward to reading the rest of the books written by the author.\u263c On a much lighter note, happy birthday to one of my most awesome, most wonderful friends, Masooma. Friends like you rarely come to a person\u2019s life and I\u2019m really lucky to have met you. I wish you everything that will make you happy and I don\u2019t need to specify books. Lol.

In this family saga and moving tale of friendship, hate and love at the same time, Hosseini abbreviates several decades of important history into a fictional story spanning more than thirty years.It's a depressing novel, consisting of a rather dark atmosphere and many chapters which will leave you gasping for breath due to the sheer amount of brutality and inhumanity some characters seem to love carrying out. What I found most intriguing in this novel was the way Hosseini managed to provide a lot of information about the history of Afghanistan, a country which has been dominated by war and destruction for such a long time. At times he came close to sounding like a nonfictional correspondent of the events with his prose, but fortunately it never felt like the author was trying to pour infodump out on his readers.\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\" is a tough book to review, simply because it deals with so many socially relevant issues that it feels like nitpicking to talk about the writing and the characterization. It's an important book which I can only encourage everyone to read as soon as possible, considering that it offers plenty food for your thoughts and leaves you pondering about themes and questions which you may not have thought about in such detailed precision before. My biggest problem with the novel was mostly about the main characters Laila and Mariam, who - thanks to the rather detached and neutral writing style - felt very difficult to connect or relate to. I started rooting for these characters throughout the course of the novel, though that's rather obvious to say considering the fate these two women had to endure in the course of the plot.As a final note, I think this book - or Hosseini's other books in general - should receive more attention by the public. Nowadays, especially here in Germany, there is a lot of displeasure directed towards foreigners and their cultures, not necessarily people from Afghanistan, but the Middle East and Far East in general. Hosseini manages to introduces his readers who are not familiar with the cultures described in this novel to a different world, a world I personally didn't know as much about before reading \"A Thousand Splendid Suns\" (and still wouldn't consider myself knowing a lot about). Khaled Hosseini's writing transports the important message that no matter where we come from, we are still all humans. Here in Germany and probably in many other places on our planet as well, people often tend to forget that coming from a different culture does not mean those humans are worth any less than we all are, and I think Hosseini's writing has the strength to remind more people of this fact. We are all human, and everyone deserves to be treated as such - no matter which cultural background you belong to."}, {"userName": "Tom Carrico", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/674536-tom-carrico", "userReview": "Book ReviewA Thousand Splendid SunsBy Khaled HosseiniReviewed by Tom CarricoIt\u2019s amazing that this author has the #1 fiction paperback (The Kite Runner) and the #1 fiction hardback (A Thousand Splendid Suns) on \u201cThe New York Times\u201d bestseller list. The Kite Runner has sold over four millions copies since its release in 2003. It is a hauntingly written novel set in war-torn Afghanistan. It is exceptionally well plotted and opens the window on a part of the world that very few of us are familiar with. The two boys in The Kite Runner are from different socio-economic circumstance but forge a friendship which transcends politics, war and economics. Even though this story is set in Afghanistan, it is a story of childhood betrayal and its consequences and could really have been set anywhere. It is a great story wonderfully told, however, and the fact that it takes place in a land few of us understand makes it educational as well as entertaining.To use a baseball metaphor, if The Kite Runner was a home run, A Thousand Splendid Suns, the author\u2019s second effort, is a game winning walk-off grand slam. The author has managed to tell the modern history of Afghanistan: from the end of the monarchy to the invasion of the Soviets to the chaos of rule by the war lords to the tight fisted maniacal rule of the Taliban to the post-9/11 return to some semblance of relative normalcy. The author again uses the device of telling the stories of two main characters of differing backgrounds, this time women. The first, Mariam, is the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy businessman in Herat. The book opens with the story of Mariam\u2019s childhood. She is sequestered on the outskirts of the city in a clay hut with her mother. Her father visits once weekly and servants from his house bring basic supplies. Mariam\u2019s mother is understandably bitter and the tension between mother and daughter is palpable. Eventually Mariam is given in marriage to Rasheed, an older shoe-maker from Kabul, mainly to remove the embarrassment of her very existence from her father\u2019s world. This man is domineering and abusive and Mariam\u2019s inability to conceive causes her to quickly fall out of favor.The second main character is Laila, a beautiful young girl who grows up as a neighbor of Rasheed and Mariam in Kabul. She has a childhood friend, Tariq, a young man who lost a leg to a Soviet land mine. As these children mature, they fall in love. Tariq\u2019s family decides to run from the warlords who by now bombarding the city. During the hysteria of their pending separation, the two young lovers conceive a child. Once Laila realizes she is pregnant and has no idea how to contact Tariq, she also marries Rasheed and convinces him that the child is his. Needless to say, the relationship between Laila and the forlorn Mariam starts out poorly and gets worse. Eventually they are brought together by their shared victim status and their mutual disgust and hatred for Rasheed. The resolution of the conflict between these two women is riveting and, well, painful. You get the impression that there aren\u2019t too many happy endings in Afghanistan.While the author tells these two women\u2019s stories, he also gives the reader a fantastic and comprehensive history lesson. The modern history of Afghanistan is complicated and the author uses some of the secondary characters to deliver this lesson. Laila\u2019s father is a school teacher and is very interested in politics and a lot of his dialogue is opinion about the current state of affairs. Laila\u2019s two older brothers fight for one of the warlords against the Communists and are both killed. Rasheed is a businessman who tries to manipulate whatever political system is in charge at the moment, which also gives insight into the political and social climate through all of these regime changes.This is not an easy book to read. Over and over again, it is heart breaking. The cruelty to women is incomprehensible. The status of medical care during the rule of the Taliban is clinically detailed by the author (who is a physician) and graphically described when Laila presents to the only hospital in Kabul which is allowed to treat women and has to undergo a Caesarean section without anesthesia because the Taliban won\u2019t fund the women\u2019s hospital. Khaled Hosseini has a writing style reminiscent of Ernest Hemingway. He writes in short, brutal sentences which conjure images that the mind can\u2019t even comprehend. He always uses the perfect word or phrase. He alludes to Hemingway in one section when Laila\u2019s father is reading The Old Man and the Sea. A Thousand Splendid Suns is also a fight against impossible odds, a story of hope when the situation is hopeless, and the resilience of the human spirit.I think that this book is destined to be a classic. It is critically important for every American who has an opinion about war, freedom and human rights to read this book. It\u2019s easy to forget the citizens of a country as it is repeatedly trampled over the decades. This book puts very real faces on people caught in the crossfire of a conflict they did not initiate. It describes conditions and situations which those of us living in the comfort of 21st century America cannot comprehend. This book is at once entertaining and horrifying, edifying and humbling, compulsively readable and appallingly shocking. It is terrific.A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini is available in hardcover from Riverhead Books."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40452101-amanda", "userReview": "I felt a little intrepid about reading this novel because I loved The Kite Runner so much, but A Thousand Splendid Suns is equally superb. The plot centers around the lives of the two distinct protagonists, Mariam and Laila. Mariam is the illegitimate daughter of wealthy businessman Jalil but is forced to live with the stigma of being a \"harami.\" She lives an isolated life with her mother, but her father visits weekly. Mariam's adoration for her father and desire for his acceptance leads to a fateful change in her entire existence. After tragedy strikes, Jalil, in his weakness, forces Mariam to marry Rasheed, an older man, and move to Kabul. Laila, on the other hand, leads a very different life. She has been raised in Kabul and has friends and a wonderful childhood sweetheart. Her father dotes on her and encourages her education. Unexpectedly, the two women's lives become intertwined by a cruel twist of fate. The novel spans over three decades and is set against the backdrop of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the ensuing internal conflict for control, and the eventual rule of the Taliban. These conflicts are central to the course of events that shape the characters' lives. As well as being a master storyteller, Hosseini has an undeniable ability to create vivid and memorable characters. After reading before bedtime, I would awaken still thinking of them. Somehow they became ingrained in my memory. For me, this is what separates a good book from a great book.A Thousand Splendid Suns is an extremely emotional read. I experienced every emotion imaginable- sorrow for the victims of Rasheed's cruelty, denial at the news of Tariq's demise, tenderness for the bond between Mariam and Laila, and indignation at Mariam's fate. I was ultimately reduced to tears when Laila travels to Herat, a beautiful moment.Memorable quote:She remembered Nana saying once that each snowflake was a sigh heaved by an aggrieved woman somewhere in the world. That all the sighs drifted up the sky, gathered into clouds, then broke into tiny pieces that fell silently on the people below."}, {"userName": "\u2744\ufe0fNani\u2744\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68538597-nani", "userReview": "4.75\u2b50\ufe0f\u201dLearn this now and learn it well.

but A Thousand Splendid Suns is even better. This book is described as breathtaking, and I have to say that is a teensy bit of an understatement. There were times, reading this, when I literally couldn't breathe, and felt like the bottom had dropped out of my stomach. But this story is beautiful, and enlightening and hopeful even through all the gritty, heart-wrenching, almost physically painful emotional rawness of it. I am surprised at how well Hosseini writes from a woman's perspective. Even though I have not experienced most of what Mariam and Laila have, this story still spoke to me in a profound and personal way. It's funny the things that we take for granted, and how fleeting everything really is. It's so easy to forget to be grateful for the luxuries and liberties that we have. Just reading about the way that women were treated under Islamic rule makes me very grateful to have what I do. I can't recommend this book to a lot of people, as it is not the easiest book to read. It is well-written, powerful, and an amazing book, but it is not an emotional trek I'd want to make very often. I am glad that I read it though... Hosseini's books do give one a different perspective on life."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/952990-rachel", "userReview": "a good story. it was easy to read and went really quickly. liberal white women will love this book. thank allah i'm an uptight radical. hosseini was disappointing for me for several reasons...1. this text and the kite runner are touted for their 'brave and unapologetic' look at the hidden lives of those suffering/maybe surviving in (the predominantly taliban-controlled era) afghanistan. whatever. this is the same story is the same story is the same story. i think the one woman even gets to paint her fingernails in the end. the topic is not so tired but the way it's addressed is- woman sold/war-torn into abusive patriarchal muslim culture, woman persevere, woman get comeuppance. well, the young pretty one that is loved by another male character- but i'll attack that later. if mid-east gender injustice is your thing, read \"woman at point zero\" out of egypt by saadawi or watch \"osama\" about afghanistan. both of these address these topics in much more eloquent and interesting ways and without (or at least done better) the false feminism.2. speaking of false feminism- this book is about women in relation to men. the plot and character development consistently rely on a male character. at one point it attempts to make the story about the relationship between the women, but, nope, back to relying on dudes. the women characters barely exist if it weren't for the men in their lives. boring.3. it perfectly fits into the western literary canon. the narrative is linear and pov is labeled by chapter. it's been written for a western audience by a non-western author about a non-western topic, i want it to respect my intelligence and write in a non-western style. it lacks the cadence and artistic quality of middle eastern literature that makes these horrible stories alive and therefore devastating (as they should be).4. the characters and their fates are generic and predictable. the story line follows popular heteronormative tropes about what is a worthwhile destiny and consequently a valuable life. one woman, mariam, is beheaded for killing her husband while trying to save the sister wife, laila. mariam is old, infertile, supposedly unattractive and up until this point has had no radical ideas of her own. laila however is young, beautiful, educated, fertile, rebellious, and has another man that she can run away with whom loves her. the sequence of events suggests to me the same old ideas about what is a livable and grievable life. boo. i don't like that this story tells me that this makes sense, that mariam has to die as a symbol because her life was recognized as less valuable and ergo less livable.i've dealt this book a good deal of hateration it might not totally deserve but i feel like if you're going to be hanging around the new york times book list you should live up to it. leave the western style to white dudes. um, but, good story though..."}, {"userName": "Pip", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5765758-pip", "userReview": "I honestly feel like no review I could ever write would do this book justice.

Saib-e-Tabrizi wrote it back in the seventeenth century, I think. I used to know the whole poem, but all I can remember now is two lines: \u2018One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.\u2019\u201dSo reminisces Laila\u2019s father, a free-thinking professor in Kabul when Laila was a child. He is a champion of women\u2019s learning, talks about the universities, the women who are doctors, thinkers, activists. \u201cAlmost two-thirds of the students at Kabul University were women now, Babi said, women who were studying law, medicine, engineering.\u201dBut before we meet Laila, we meet Mariam, the illegitimate child of Jalil, a successful businessman in Herat, a city near the border with Iran, where more traditional customs are followed. He has three wives and their children all living in his home. Nana, Mariam\u2019s mother, worked for him and he refused to add her to the family when she fell pregnant to him, but he provided meagre support in a primitive hut in the bush. Mariam adored Jalil and his visits.She is curious and interested in everything, but her mother says \u201cWhat\u2019s the sense schooling a girl like you? It\u2019s like shining a spittoon.\u201d She tells Mariam she needs only one skill.\u201c\u2018Only one skill. And it\u2019s this: tahamul. Endure.\u2019\u2018Endure what, Nana?\u2019 \u2018Oh, don\u2019t you fret about that,\u2019 Nana said. \u2019There won\u2019t be any shortage of things.\u2019\u201dThat pretty much sums up what Mariam can expect from life.Laila is considerably younger and lives in the city of Kabul, goes to school, is clever, reads, mixes with friends and her best pal, Tariq, who\u2019s lost a leg. He\u2019s another bright kid, and they clown around a lot together as kids do. As they get older, they begin to develop an attraction for each other, but fighting comes to Kabul.I won\u2019t attempt to cover who was fighting whom, or which countries were supplying arms and aid to which sides. Suffice to say, once the Soviets were pushed out of Afghanistan and the various factions were striving for supremacy:\u201cThe Mujahideen, armed to the teeth but now lacking a common enemy, had found the enemy in each other. Kabul\u2019s day of reckoning had come at last.\u201dBy this time, Mariam had ended up in Kabul, so we now have two heroines to worry about. The author explains in his notes that when he wrote The Kite Runner, he wrote it for himself, as he wanted to tell the story of two boys and a father/son relationship. This time, he wanted to tell a story of two girls and a mother/daughter relationship. I have to say, he\u2019s done a satisfying job of getting into the heads of the characters, both as girls, and as women, so they seemed like real women to me. As their paths cross, Mariam and Laila form a powerful relationship.The bombing and shootings are relentless, and the terror is real, with \u201cbodies dragged from the rubble, the hands and feet of children discovered on rooftops or the high branch of some tree days after their funeral.\u201dHow women and families endure is beyond me. Men are subsidiary characters, but because of the nature of the extreme Sharia laws instigated by the Mujahideen, men are all-powerful. I mean ALL powerful. Hands are chopped off, people are strung up in public, grisly beatings are regular. Women must be covered and can go nowhere without a male member of the family. Men must wear beards a fist-length below the chin in length, and beards are measured, non-conformists beaten.But the stories told about the past and the stories looked forward to in the future are wonderful. The author grew up there in the 1970s and describes the delightful places he remembers. There is more than a passing reference to the glory of that part of the world for centuries before this and the possibilities for future generations if the world pays attention.It\u2019s not all as grim as I\u2019ve made it sound, and it is a way to begin to understand how resilient people are and how much they will \u201cendure\u201d before they feel they must leave their homes and their history if their children are to survive.Brute power should have had its day by now, but, sadly, it seems not."}, {"userName": "Dana Ilie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21690081-dana-ilie", "userReview": "A Thousand Splendid Suns is a book by Khaled Hosseini. I found this book emotionally captivating and also a real eye opener, I had never before truly understood the hardship of female life under Taliban rule.Undeniably Khaled Hossaini is a great story teller. His depictions of Afghanistan and his characters bring them to life for the reader.Overall, it was a beautiful book that really opened my eyes to the wonderful people of Afghanistan and their history and how many women are still mistreated today."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "Kabul, Afghanistan\nOne could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls\n - Saib-e-TabriziI cannot write a proper review of this book. By the end, I was weeping so that it was difficult to see the words on the page, they swam before my eyes. I would stop, clear my eyes, stop crying, pick up the book and almost immediately proceed to cry again. I cannot remember the last time a book hit me at such an emotional level. I read Hosseini\u2019s And the Mountains Echoed earlier this year and thought it an excellent work, and he an excellent writer. It was nothing compared to this. And, a bonus is that I came away feeling I have some deeper understanding of the people and the region for which so much American blood has been spilt. I\u2019m am sure I could never look at the conflict or the people in a dispassionate way having read this heartfelt novel.I have had this book sitting on a table waiting to be the next book up for years. I put it on my challenge last year and it was the only book there that I did not complete. I have reached over it to grab lesser books and have no explanation for why. Don\u2019t let this happen to you. If you have not read A Thousand Splendid Suns you are missing something important."}], "description": "At once an incredible chronicle of thirty years of Afghan history and a deeply moving story of family, friendship, faith, and the salvation to be found in love.Propelled by the same superb instinct for storytelling that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once an incredible chronicle of thirty years of Afghan history, and a deeply moving story of family, friendship, faith, and the salvation to be found in love. Born a generation apart and with very different ideas about love and family, Mariam and Laila are two women brought jarringly together by war, by loss and by fate. As they endure the ever escalating dangers around them\u2014in their home as well as in the streets of Kabul\u2014they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation. With heart-wrenching power and suspense, Hosseini shows how a woman's love for her family can move her to shocking and heroic acts of self-sacrifice, and that in the end it is love\u2014or even the memory of love\u2014that is often the key to survival.", "title": "A Thousand Splendid Suns", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns?ac=1", "average": 4.35, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1345958969l/128029.jpg", "reviews": 45986, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/569.Khaled_Hosseini", "name": "Khaled Hosseini"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3850639-a-thousand-splendid-suns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/834713.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1975260._", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17310208", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4906099-a-thousand-splendid-suns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2308432.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9596414", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77203.The_Kite_Runner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16115612-and-the-mountains-echoed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11296523-the-kite-runner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3142296-the-kite-runner-a-thousand-splendid-suns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21897740-and-the-mountains-echoed-free-preview"]}
