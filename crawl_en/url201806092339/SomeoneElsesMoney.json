She didn't care for the book too much, but I started reading it anyway. I hated it. Then I tried coming back to it in middle school, skipping ahead to get the gist of the book. I still hated it. By high school, I gave up on the book altogether, and I think I gave it away to someone. There are some times when you have to just let things go, and I did. Bottom line, there was a lot of potential here for an interesting story, but it got bogged down by unnecessary information. History and expository passages are great when used properly, but a detriment when they pop up every five pages. And keep in mind that this is a  LONG  book. The most fascinating character in the book was Buford Gudge's (his name is burned into my literary memory and my compendium of odd tidbits) half-sister. I felt like she got a bad break from beginning to end, and that she was not viewed with enough sympathy, either by Gudge, the other characters, or even the author. I may try and come back to it later, but I highly doubt that I will."}, {"userName": "Rosie Crawford", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118307-rosie-crawford", "userReview": "Excellent read, well researched so lots to learn about rare art, high finance, and how the jet set lives. Good plot with mostly believable characters."}], "description": "", "title": "Someone Else's Money", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216973.Someone_Else_s_Money", "average": 3.64, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1391697921l/216973.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/127148.Michael_M_Thomas", "name": "Michael M.
