Those who live in trailers, drugs, drinking, often their own worse enemies, hooking up with the wrong people, casual sex etc. Franklin also mentions the many fantastic authors who have come from this state, those in the past. and those in the present, maybe because of the many colorful characters they have to draw from.So some of these stories are from familiar names, Ace Atkins and I loved his story, Combustible, William Boyle, Megan Abbott, Michael Kardos and relative newcomer, Michael Farris Smith, whose story Magnolia was one of my favorites. Another one that sent chills down my spine and make me think twice about where I stop for gas or a restroom is the story, Pit Stop by John M Floyd. Though in this one the heroine manages to have a relatively normal life with a nice twist thrown in. Some of these stories will just be going along but end with an unexpected bang. Where did that come from? So I enjoyed these, a few more than others but actually an amazing grouping of stories from many great or soon to be great southern authors.ARC from Librarything."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7852584-lauren", "userReview": "What you need to know about this is that it's a collection of Southern noir edited by Tom Franklin, and also Megan Abbott and Ace Atkins have stories in it, as do a lot of other great writers who fall later in the alphabet. Akashic won't rest until every corner of the country has an anthology exploring its more desperate residents, and its Mississippi installment is particularly great. (Side-note: hey, Akashic, Kentucky has meth and horse racing, great ingredients for both modern and classic noir. Just saying.)Mississippi Noir sports a nice combination of plot-driven stories and mood pieces. I'll go on record as saying that Southern regional writing is some of the most gorgeous writing there is, so the moodier and more ambiguous stories here proved to be my favorites. Megan Abbott's \"Oxford Girl\" is a lush ballad retelling that takes what could be cheap and predictable news fodder--a romance between a frat boy and a sorority girl that ends in murder--and invests it with depth and a kind of heightened sensuality and mysticism; Lee Durkee's \"My Dear, My One True Love\" does the same thing with a man who seems to always date \"crazy women.\" There are sparer stories here that really work for me, too, like Ace Atkins's modern YA rural noir \"Combustible,\" which also takes on a familiar story, but which achieves its resonance by piling on specificity. It has maybe the best sense of place in the whole collection. I also really loved Mary Miller's ambiguous, unstable \"Uphill,\" which opens a brief window up into one couple's complicity in a crime that they don't have to see through to the end, and Michael Kardos's \"Digits,\" a horror story about a creative writing class where the students grow in skill and profundity as they start lopping off their fingers.There are stories here that don't quite work for me, as can be expected in any anthology, but the overall quality is very high. In some cases, the setting seems incidental, but it's remarkable how reading a location-themed anthology cues you in to the smaller ways place shapes characters and stories, from the way the backgrounds of the students in \"Digits\" to the lack of economic opportunity in \"Uphill\" to the flooding in \"God's Gonna Trouble the Water.\" You wouldn't think a noir collection would work as tourist advertising, but I found myself drawn to Mississippi after reading this: Franklin's selections sell it as a place where profundity grows like a weed and storytelling comes naturally."}, {"userName": "Faith", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith", "userReview": "I had noticed the \"noir\" collections of short stories from this publisher for awhile and decided to try one. It was the name of Tom Franklin that drew me to this collection, unfortunately I wasn't paying enough attention to notice that he didn't write any of the stories, just the introduction.The collection is very uneven. Some of the stories were good, although none rose to the level of great. Many more were so slight that I wondered why they were published. The stories were a melange of tough kids, bad step fathers, sudden violence, murders and drug dealers. Also, it appears that pinky removal is a \"thing\" in Mississippi. I did enjoy \"Most Things Haven't Worked Out\" by William Boyle in which a 15 year old boy is befriended by a new woman in town. The boy \"got broken by being so close to kindness.\" I thought that \"Digits\" by Michael Kardos was interesting and creepy, but I didn't understand it. A dissertation on crazy women \"My Dear, My One True Love\" by Lee Durkee was different and entertaining.

Averaging out to a solid 3.5 stars.1. Combustible by Ace Atkins - An abused girl gets back at her stepfather. Short good read with a dangling ending. (4/5)2. Lord of Madison County by Jimmy Cajoleas - Wow! I don't even know how to start. This is about rich, white kids. The main character hooks up as a drug dealer out of boredom, fakes getting Jesus, bags the pastor's daughter and ends up in very serious trouble with his supplier. A hardcore story but in the end it's about the pastor who really does practice what he preaches. (5/5)3. Losing Her Religion by Rachell R. Smith-Spears - Heavy duty story of a woman who gives up everything for the married man who has just broken up with her. Powerful writing. (5/5)4. Most Things Haven't Worked Out by William Boyle - Fantastic! A rip-roaring exciting read. A crime you could say, but it's about two people who were abused as kids and how they were ruined, one by hate and one by kindness. A very poignant ending. Complex, interesting characters. (5/5)5. Uphill by Mary Miller - Nothing really happens in this story. A woman with a penchant for loser boyfriends tells about her current situation and ruminates on her past and future. Pretty boring. (2/5)6. Boy and Girl Games Like Coupling by Jamie Paige - Very short. Narrated by the boy, it's about the moment a girl learns she's dating a psychopath. (3/5)7. Oxford Girl by Megan Abbott - Brilliant. I loved this story! The narrative switches back and forth between a college couple starting with the girl finding out she's pregnant. Then they each tell the story of their relationship from the beginning to the dark, dark end. (5/5)8. Digits by Michael Kardos - This is really creepy and I loved it until the end. A college English professor notices that students in the class are missing fingers. It's a great creepy story but ends suddenly and I didn't get it. I still don't get it. I would have given it a five but my rating is reduced because don't like stories to leave me bewildered. (3/5)9. Moonface by Andrew Paul - A man recounts an event from his youth when he caused someone's death. OK. (3/5)10. God's Gonna Trouble the Water by Dominiqua Dickey - This is a sad story but has a redemptive ending. A white boy and black girl have a four-year-old daughter. The boy wants nothing but them to be a family, while the girl knows they can ever have a normal life together because of their colour. The boy steals his little girl every now and then to get her mother to come to him. This time, he takes her on the night of a big storm and it's the last time he does. Very good. I love the narrative voice. (5/5)11. My Dear, My One True Love by Lee Durkee - This is very short, a few pages. So briefly, a man narrates his attraction to crazy women. The ending was as I expected. Not bad. (3/5)12. Hero by Michael Farris Smith - Just ok, not much really happens. About a boy who doesn't talk and his abusive father narrated by the next door neighbour who takes day labour jobs and has a large psychic-for-hire wife. (2/5)13. Pit Stop by John M. Floyd - On a road trip, a mother tells her daughter about the time she was attacked by a serial killer. A really good story that had me riveted. Only problem is that the ending was disappointing. (3/5)14. Anglers of the Keep by Roger Busby - A melancholy tale of a dying man whose daughter has arranged a lung transplant for him. The man tells his secrets to his ex-son-in-law on the journey to the clinic. (4/5)15. Jerry Lewis by Jack Pendarvis - A guy has a mysterious encounter with a dangerous woman. Short and kind of dumb. (2/5)16. Cheap Suitcase and a New Town by Chris Offutt - A lonely woman waitressing in a town she recently moved to gives a much younger waitress some advice and then moves on. I don't get the point of this. Boring.

The first hint of what to expect from the book's sixteen stories comes in the blunt opening paragraph of Tom Franklin's two-page introduction:\t\"Welcome to Mississippi, where a recent poll shows we have the most corrupt government in the United States. Where we are first in infant mortality, childhood obesity, childhood diabetes, teenage pregnancy, adult obesity, adult diabetes. We also have the highest poverty rate in the country.\tAnd, curiously, the highest concentration of kick-ass writers in the country, too,\"And judging strictly from the number of writers who make their homes in Oxford, the claim about \"kick-ass writers\" might very well be true. (But sadly, so are the other ones.) This Mississippi-based story collection features the work of a few familiar names, such as Ace Atkins, writers newly-come to the genre, and even a couple of writers being published for the first time. As is always the case with the Akashic books in the series, the sixteen stories are divided into four thematic sections with tiles that give a clue to the type of story housed there: \"Conquest & Revenge,\" \"Wayward Youth,\" Bloodlines,\" and \"Skipping Town.\"As it turns out, my three favorite stories come from three different sections of the book: \"Lord of Madison County,\" by the first-time-published Jimmy Cajoleas, \"Oxford Girl\" by the already well-known Megan Abbott, and \"Pit Stop\", by veteran writer John M. Floyd.\"Lord of Madison County\" tells of a seasoned teenaged drug dealer who has stumbled upon the best way imaginable to hide the truth about himself - he pretends to be a Jesus freak interested only in spreading the word of God among his peers. When, predictably, the young man learns that, not only is he nearly as smart as he thinks he is, but that bigger, badder criminals are all around him, things do not go particularly well for him and his preacher's-daughter girlfriend.\"Oxford Girl\" takes the rather unusual approach of adopting its plot from an English ballad dating back to the 1820s. The old ballad tells the story of a young woman who is brutally murdered by the man she believes she is going to marry. The short story cleverly cites verses from one version of the old song as the story about two University of Mississippi students unfolds along eerily similar lines. There is one key difference, however, that makes the story especially effective - unlike the song, which is narrated by the killer, the story's narrator is the murdered girl.And then there's \"Pit Stop,\" a story that likely would have warmed the heart of Alfred Hitchcock. In this one, a young woman is telling her little girl a story from her past, the one in which she encountered the infamous \"Night Stalker\" who killed several women along Mississippi's Highway 25. An abundance of false leads and misdirection - along with plenty of clues that point to the Stalker's true identity - make this one a fun and satisfying read.Bottom Line: Mississippi Noir meets the high standard set by it predecessors in this Akashic Books series."}, {"userName": "Sheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1771463-sheryl", "userReview": "I adore southern fiction and \u201cMississippi Noir\u201d did not let me down that is for sure.

It had a good Romeo/Juliet plot with the right characters and a great setting. But it was far too cliched - the writing was mediocre with unrelated details and plodding dialog.On the awful end of the scale was \"Oxford Girl\". This was, by far, the worst story in the book.

Mississippi as a state is a fount of great literature, including some of my favorites like Eudora Welty and William Faulkner. It is also a state rich in the mystery genre with settings perfect for suspense. It\u2019s not wonder, then, that this anthology is a standout in an excellent series.Tom Franklin organized the stories in four sections, the first has stories of conquest and revenge. The second features wayward youth, the third is called Bloodlines with some of the most painful stories and the last section is called Skipping Town. The stories are often grim, tragic and heartbreaking, but not always. The last story, \u201cCheap Suitcase and a New Town\u201d is even kind of hopeful\u2026kind of.Mississippi is a powerful presence in most of the stories, not just the landscape, but the grinding poverty and the pernicious racism are a backdrop to many of the stories.I disliked one story, \u201cOxford Girl\u201d by Megan Abbott. I would like to forget that story. It was, however, well-written. Like all the other stories, it was emotional powerful and wrenching. I disliked it on a deep level, in part because it reflects a truth about misogyny, about men who kill women simply because they feel that\u2019s their right as men. I can\u2019t deny the art, what I really hate is the reality it represents.I loved \u201cGod\u2019s Gonna Trouble the Waters\u201d by Dominqua Dickey. It was fascinating, a story of multi-generational secrets and the power they have, but also a story of love and redemption. William Boyle\u2019s \u201cMost Things Haven\u2019t Worked Out\u201d broke my heart. \u201cI got broken by being so close to kindness.\u201d Is there a sadder sentence?I loved Mississippi Noir and recommend it highly. It gives us entr\u00e9e to the variety and vitality of Mississippi, not just from the dirt roads of entrenched poverty but also the wide streets of suburbia and middle class ennui.

The pronounced social conditions that make the Magnolia State ripe for noirish exploration\u2014political corruption, infant mortality, the highest poverty rate in the nation\u2014recall a saying from Franklin's Alabama upbringing: \"Thank God for Mississippi; otherwise we'd be at the bottom of everything.\" Divided thematically into four sections, these 16 stories share some common denominators: doomed love (\"There was a girl in all of this,\" says the narrator in Andrew Paul's \"Moonface\"), often fatal decision-making, and revenge. As always, established authors (Megan Abbott, Ace Atkins) share space with promising newcomers (Jimmy Cajoleas, Dominiqua Dickey), but the collection struggles to break out of its tonal rut. The most memorable pieces take the definition of noir beyond the expected: William Boyle's \"Most Things Haven't Worked Out\" is reminiscent of the gothic fatalism in Flannery O'Connor's stories, while Michael Kardos's \"Digits,\" about a writing teacher whose students come to class with fewer and fewer fingers, veers into Shirley Jackson territory.
