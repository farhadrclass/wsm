Bugs of any sort represent the ultimate squick factor for me, and an entire story dedicated to a bedbug infestation was almost more than I could stand. I'm still scratching and feeling paranoid. I definitely won't be looking too closely at my pillowcases tonight for fear of actually seeing something I just don't need to see: ignorance is bliss on this account. The less I know the better. In its setup and slow build, the book reminded me a lot of Rosemary's Baby: young, successful couple move into a fabulous apartment. Wife begins to see things, husband thinks she's crazy. Is wife crazy? Or will she be vindicated? At what cost will such vindication come? I loved how long Winters is able to keep me in suspense on this count. I had my suspicions and theories, but I never knew with certainty until it all came out in the end, and what an ending! It totally made that slow crawl for the first three-quarters of the book worth it. I would love to see this story adapted for the big screen. That would be awesome.

During that time, a coworker who lived in Williamsburg confided in me that she had bedbugs in her railroad style apartment. An apartment that I visited, and internally I freaked the eff out. Suffice to say\u2014as someone who gets a little paranoid and Google happy\u2014I know a thing or two about bedbugs. But enough about me. This is a book about bedbugs. This is not a book about bedbugs. Oh wait it is. Oh wait, I have no idea what this book was really about. What I mean is, I don't know what was \"real\" or imagined toward the end of the book, and I don't believe that my confusion was the intended by the writer. Or maybe it was. I believe it was because this was a story that needed heavy editing and revising. Overall, the feeling I get from Bedbugs is that it was a loosely thrown together in a plot that unravels in the end and there were a lot of unnecessary frayed threads poking out all over the place. This is a problem for a book that is only 256 pages. I felt like it was written by a wannabe writer. If I read a book that reminds me of my own creative writing endeavors, I know it's bad because I was a crap writer, which is why I gave it up. Sure, I'd love to give some concrete examples from the book, but that would require me to spend more time inside of it, and I feel like I've devoted enough of my life inside its pages.Maybe my level of dislike for this book is shaped on my faulty assumption that I was going to read a book about a classic bedbug infestation and be absolutely horrified by the possible reality of this happening to me. This was not the case. Instead, this was a book about crazy people and/or people who were not likeable and nothing about the story felt like it could be related to my reality. The characters are not easy to like. Except for maybe the kid. She was OK. The nanny was selfish and lazy. If I had a child and could afford a nanny and she was like this, she would have had a short tenure watching my child. And why did they have a nanny? It seems like Susan didn't do anything that required one. All of the things she did while the nanny was around, could have been done without her being around.The wife, Susan, was kind of selfish, too--quitting her job to paint and never painting. She wasn't very happy and really wasn't very productive. Readers like to see a character do something to change their flaws and by change, I don't mean go crazy. She did none of this. She did stuff, but the stuff wasn't interesting.The husband, Alex, was OK, but was neither likeable or unlikeable. He was just there occupying the space of the pages, but overall he was a pretty good guy. Irritable, which is understandable due to his financial stress, but good overall. Then the author tries make us question his good-guyness with a few little mentions from Susan about some hidden threatening, menacing part of him she was afraid of. Well, it just wasn't there, but nice try. Overall, he was practically a mannequin who was good with his kid. The handy man was a creep, and the landlord, Andrea, was weird and crazy. Enough said about those two for now.Then there's the whole issue of them being tight on money, yet getting a bigger, more expensive apartment and paying for a nanny that wasn't necessary. I think that if you're going to quit your job to paint and then not paint while your husband struggles to make a business succeed, you should probably not be worried about expensive beds and new apartments and nannies.Here are some more random things I disliked:If there were actual bedbugs in this book, the husband and daughter would have had bites. If this was a book about badbugs, then that is just annoying and the title should have been Badbugs. People would would have still thought it was about bedbugs and it would have done nothing to spoil the introduction of badbugs plot turn.There were times that I thought I was picking up on huge clues or foreshadowing of what was to come, but these pricks of my mind turned out to be nothing or kind of poorly done. I expected something more to be said about this expensive bed that Susan kind of selfishly convinced her husband to splurge on. I expected the infestation to possibly start from it, but it was just something mentioned and then abandoned. I thought the painting would hold actual significance, and I guess there was some parallel to what happened to it and what actually happened in the book, but I expected more. I expected it to be revealed who was changing the painting, but it was probably Susan with all of the Ambien and wine she gobbled up. This was just crap. Oh, and this whole thing about the mother who let the baby carriage roll off the roof of a building killing her kids? It served no solid purpose. It had no necessity to the plot, yet it kept being thrown back into the book. I feel like the author thought it was some very cool element that she would weave into the plot and then AHA! bring mention it again in the end. It wasn't woven at all. It was thrown in there here and there awkwardly. I take issue with the sudden turning on the nanny. Sure, it was after Susan read about the badbugs and it was obvious she had issues with her, but it seemed so unnatural, especially the things she said/conclusions she jumped to and the way she let the nanny kind of walk all over her. Of course, this is probably an attempt to establish that she's crazy, but it did not fit the character or progression of the events taking place in a way that was natural.What happened with the cat urine smell anyway? That cannot be explained away by the dying girl trying to \"ping\" for help in the basement because cat urine and human urine do not smell alike.Also, it seemed odd that Susan killed the handyman. If there were more clues to him \"knowing too much\" or some other motivation for the sudden hammer to the head (perhaps by some dialogue between Susan and Andrea). He didn't deserve it either. He was OK. Weird, but OK."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/287912-melissa", "userReview": "This reminds me of Rosemary's Baby with bedbugs. Disgusting, horrible bedbugs. Unfortunately Susan is such a horrible character, I admit I never got too worked up with her plight. I feel like I maybe there are some fine details that got lost in all the bedbug yuckiness. At first there are demonic bedbugs that only Susan can see but then there are also real bedbugs that everyone else can see too? How did the exterminator get into the apartment when Susan was locked in the bonus room? If you painted a picture in some sort of trance state & the subject of the painting had horrible bedbug bites on her face that you didn't actually paint in, wouldn't you just remove it from your house? And honestly, why would a husband make up a story of infidelity that never happened to appease his wife who is threatening him with a knife? Wouldn't you in that case maybe say, \"Golly no, of course I didn't get that matchbook from a hotel while I was cheating on you, dear.\" And a matchbook, I ask you. Really?

Only Winters's writing keeps it above a single star rating. It's really pretty dumb. SPOILERS BELOW (can't hide b/c on phone) SPOILERS BELOWI guess the ONLY way this makes sense at all is that the bedbugs were indeed badbugs, because otherwise how did the exterminator fail to find any signs of them initially? Absolutely no idea how to explain the changes to the painting though. And aside from that, how did little old A. manage to kill Louis and drag his (large body)? Why couldn't Susan stop her? Alex stopped Susan (armed with a knife), and yet Susan can't stop a little old lady with a hammer?? (Leaving aside the silliness of Susan deciding to knife Alex - and, based on the epilogue, his immediate forgiveness of the same.)Honestly, seems like Winters, during the NY bedbug scare thought \"bedbugs\" ... \"No, BADbugs!\" and churned out this story (which might have been better served as a short story) based on that one thought. All that said ... will put in another plug here for his far superior \"Last Policeman\" and sequels."}, {"userName": "Sheena  at Hot Eats and Cool Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2718510-sheena-at-hot-eats-and-cool-reads", "userReview": "I have a huge bedbug paranoia, no joke.

The fact that I can still remember virtually the entire novel a year or two later is a pretty good sign for me. :)"}, {"userName": "Sean McGovern", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10450818-sean-mcgovern", "userReview": "There's a great episode of CBS Radio Mystery Theater (circa 1970) called \"The Real Printer's Devil\" - where a married couple (plus one child) rent a \"too good to be true\" apartment turns out to be just that, with one of those dark endings that doesn't feel tacked on, and leaves you feeling equally sad and invigorated.Now I told you that to tell you this: Internet Bookstore 002 suggested Ben H. Winter's \"Bedbug\" to be based on a review I wrote of Joe Hill's \"Heart Shaped Box\" - and when I read the blurb, I could see why. Both \"HSB\" and \"Bedbugs\" both have plots that sound laughable - in the case of \"Bedbugs,\" in an insect invasion with a \"Yellow Wallpaper\" or \"Turn of the Screw\" type twist - only the protagonist *knows* that the weird happenings are really happening. And like all the great \"beautiful, happy people lose their shit\" type horror, all of the elements are in play: Slightly strained marriage,cute kid, and a \"too good to be true\" element that has just been introduced that can only make their lives better.As Susan (protg.) and Alex (dorky-yet-vaguely threatening husband) move into their net brownstone apartment in Brooklyn Heights, Susan begins to get attacked by the following - general anxiety, fears that her husband is being unfaithful, the smell of urine, fears that her life is a lie, and the title monsters that only she can see/feel so let's add mental state to the list and be done.Ok. That's pretty much it - because none of these things (save the last one, of course) go anywhere. There's no growing sense of paranoia or even just the mounting dread that the whole world may be arrayed against Susan - the distant tone of the writing has the effect of making you think that everyone is just \"annoyed\" - which ended up having the same effect of me. I knew the terror should be mounting, I kept thinking \"I should be scared. I should be freaked out.\" But Susan only really takes action against the bedbugs - everything else is just \"Oh, my husband might be cheating on me and it's causing me to have psychotic episodes, dum-de-dum\" - she doesn't investigate ANYTHING that is supposed to be making her weaker, more frayed at the edges, more open to the \"thrilling\" climax of the book.That smell of urine, the first major \"something is very wrong here\" moment? Never mentioned again.Her husband's possible trysting with the nanny? Susan only worries about it when she interacts with the nanny.Oh, sure, she can whine about how she feels like her life is going nowhere - but she does nothing to correct its course, nothing to make you root for her. She's already a corpse, just one that's walking around. I couldn't even get the thrill of rooting for the bedbugs after -------------'s Bond Villain Speech, because I had guessed the who, the why and the how after reading 50 pages and the back blurb. And there was nothing to make me forget my \"Huh-it's X\" guess through out, no grip, nothing.Honestly, go to the iTunes podcast page and give a listen to \"The Real Printer's Devil\" - at least it's enjoyable cheese."}, {"userName": "C.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5064041-c", "userReview": "This is a great read. Especially if you are a fan of those books where a couple moves into a too good to be true home where the husband works and the wife stays home and unpacks and takes care of the kids and discovers strange happenings type books. Which I tend to love. But there is something for everyone in this novel especially readers who enjoy a well written thriller with a hint of horror. The Wendts, Alex and Susan, find the perfect brownstone in Brooklyn from a Craigslist ad. It's owned by a somewhat charming elderly landlady named Andrea who takes a liking to them. The couple decide to move into the home where their toddler Emma will finally have a room of her own. Alex is a photographer who owns a business, and his wife, Susan is an artist. She plans on painting in the small well-lit bonus room. Things are exceptionally great at first. They have a sitter who watches Emma during the day and Susan runs errands and fixes up the place while Alex works and helps out the best he can at home and the family enjoys the idyllic location which is close to shopping and historical New York landmarks. There is also talk of bedbugs. People seem to dread the unwanted insects and they are a horror to get out of the house. Rumor has it that hotels have closed for fumigation and people have moved to rid themselves of the pests. Extermination can work, but sometimes, the bedbugs come back. Susan learns more about the dreaded infestations on the internet when she suspects that she has been bitten. She believes the culprit is a bedbug. A recommended exterminator gives the place a clean bill of health, but it doesn't help Susan's fears. She becomes consumed with the thought of bugs, and she starts to have horrible dreams. Also mysterious is the couple who used to own the apartment who left without paying their last months rent. Susan finds a mysterious picture of the couple stashed away in a window sil. The handyman, Louis, tells her about them. This is a fun read. You'll probably stay up late, if you dare, into the night because you won't be able to put it down. It will be a great read when the chilly weather of Autumn rolls in. This book is smooth, polished, and very well done. It's a creepy escape that you're going to love."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2510203-ryan", "userReview": "Normally I love to read horror books once the weather starts to get a little chillier. There is something about having that nip in the air and the shorter days that makes me want to curl up on the couch, with as little light as possible, and delve into something that will scare the hell out of me. Sadly, due to time constraints, I had to read this one when it was over 100 degrees outside and not getting dark until after nine o'clock. For once, that didn't bother me, I was still able to forget about my surroundings and get so lost in the story, that I would be checking my pillows for any scurrying creatures before I would set my head down for bed.I'm addicted to a lot of the horror novels written in the 60s and 70s, and this one has that retro vibe for me. Two of my favorites, Rosemary's Baby by Ira Levin and The Sentinel by Jeffrey Konvitz, even start off the same way. Young couple/single woman moves into a new apartment and everything seems to being going right at first. Of course there are always subtle hints that not everything is as it should be. Eccentric neighbors always seem to be around, strange occurrences that only happens to one of them (normally the woman), and a miasma that seemed to hang in the air, slowly suffocating the inhabitants of the apartment.This book had all of that and so much more going for it. The author had an almost supernatural ability to balance the home life of the Wendt's with the growing sense of apprehension. A lot of horror books I've read will sacrifice the characters for the story. Thankfully Bedbugs isn't one of them. A story that asks the reader to believe in something so personal as a malignant presence that attacks you in the bed, has to have characters that you not only believe, but care about it. As a reader, you have to be able to relate to them. Susan, Alex, and Emma are fully functional, 4D characters that were a treat to know.The horror was built slowly, it worked it's way towards a simmer, and then boiled over in such a way that the sheer violence of the climax left me holding my breath and gasping for proverbial air. I was horrified, and thrilled by the conclusion even though I saw it coming a mile away. A good horror book doesn't have to throw out an ending that comes out of left field. A good horror novel will allow the reader to figure out the ending, but still horrify them in the end. It's needs to be believable no matter how outlandish the plot points. It's hard to write a credible story that will leave a reader altering their bedtime habits. Bedbugs not only pulls it off, but it pulls it off in such a way that you won't know what hit you until you are going to bed the night after and you are still checking for telltale signs of an infestation."}, {"userName": "Kaylie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4362515-kaylie", "userReview": "Bedbugs is about when the Wendt family rents an apartment at an very low price in a neighborhood in Brooklyn. The family rent it from an old widow named Andrea Scharfstein, who lives just below on the ground floor.

Susan wants to try and \u201crevive\u201d her passion for painting that she had to put aside whenever her daughter Emma was born.\tAs time goes on in the story Susan becomes a bit paranoid.

It made me start to get paranoid about bedbugs being everywhere just like Susan did. At some times, it was slow getting through some parts but it\u2019s worth it.

Bedbugs was one of those.Like I just said, I had never heard of Bedbugs or even it's author, Ben H. Winters. And I would have never had the fortune of reading it if it hadn't come up under one of those ubiquitous \"best horror novels\" lists that seem to pop up everywhere online. I didn't even read a synopsis or do any kind of research into the story, but instead downloaded a kindle version (honestly never knowing if I would ever read it) and decided that since I was just finishing a novel, and that I've been on an absolute whirlwind of finishing books this year (2017) I'd give the thing a shot. And let me tell you, I'm sure as hell glad I did. Bedbugs is the perfect example of what modern day horror should be. It's current and fits in well with contemporary themes (as the title so obviously states), has characters that actually matter and have actual, real-life, problems, and, best of all, it's written in a tight paced prose that has that familiar gothic, slow creep feel, continuously building an ever increasing horror, right up until the very end. Plus, it keeps the reader guessing, making us question if what's happening in the story is really happening or if Susan, the main character is, in fact, suffering the malevolence of the titular characters.I will admit that I was slightly let down with the conclusion, especially after the incredible build up and non-stop tension, but, short and rather brief as it was, it made sense and worked well with the story. Sure, I'd have loved to have seen Winters draw the story out more, maybe add some more detail here and there, but on second thought Bedbugs benefits from its lean and quick storyline and any added exposition would bog down a near perfect work of literary horror.Bravo, Mr. Winters. Bravo!"}, {"userName": "Robert Beveridge", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/766524-robert-beveridge", "userReview": "Ben H. Winters, Bedbugs (Quirk Books, 2011)Full disclosure: this book was provided to me free of charge by Amazon Vine.Okay, a topical (read: this will be dated in five years) horror novel from a guy listed as a New York Times bestseller? I bit without doing my research, which ended up being annoying. I had my suspicions when I saw Quirk as the publisher, and then the author description confirmed my worst fears: \u201cBen H. Winters is the New York Times bestselling author of Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters...\u201d Lord save us from this current classic novel-monster movie mashup fad, which is getting more idiotic every month. But still, I loved the jacket copy on this, which made it sound like a weird mix of Rosemary's Baby and The Sentinel, two of my favorite cheesy horror novels, so I dove in. And while no one will ever confuse Ben Winters with Jeffrey Konvitz, Bedbugs delivers nicely.I do not know Ben Winters, nor do I know anything about his life, but I'm going to take a few guesses: he's about my age (early forties), maybe a few years younger, and he grew up on a steady diet of crappy horror novels during the Golden Age of the seventies and eighties. I say this because Bedbugs, while definitely a contemporary book (and as influenced by Bret Easton Ellis as by anything Golden Age\u2014please, authors, I beg you, quit with the product placement...), is very much informed not only by Levin and Konvitz, but by any number of others the true crap-horror buff will recognize from back in the day\u2014Helen McCloy, Rick Hautala, Ken Eulo, I think I may have even caught a slight whiff of early Joy Fielding, who was writing pulp horror novels before she made it big in the thriller world. (Specifically, I'm thinking of The Transformation, which if you're a Fielding fan and you haven't read, you should be spending every available moment trying to hunt down.) And I grant you, authors that blend up old influences and regurgitate them onto the page are a dime a dozen, but as I said back in paragraph one, there's no point in this book at which Winters would be mistaken for any of them. He's pulled out all the old horror tropes and dragged them kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century, and it's about bloody time someone did.Plot: ex-lawyer Susan Wendt, who left behind her stressful, high-paying corporate job to return to her art, is looking for a new apartment. She has a husband and a daughter, but they're more important as plot points than as characters. (This is the book's weakest aspect; the minor characters are there for the sole purpose of advancing Susan, Louis the handyman, and Andrea the landlord on the narrative path.) She finds the oldest horror trope in the book: a gorgeous two-floor space in Red Hook, which, okay, is losing property values by the minute right now but is still in Brooklyn fergossake, for a steal. Turns out it's the top two floors of a converted house owned by Andrea, a slightly crazy old lady whose husband shuffled off this mortal coil a few years before. Andrea has a pal named Louis who does the handiwork. He's less crazy than Andrea, but still a little cocked, if you get my drift. In any case, Susan falls in love with the place, immediately latches onto Andrea as a mother figure, and within days her family has moved into the place. All well and good, except that the current bedbug craze has swept through Brooklyn like wildfire. Everyone's talking about bedbugs. It's enough to make a person think they have bites when the best exterminator in town tells you you don't have them. And your husband and kid have no bites. It's even enough to make you think that maybe the bugs are supernatural in origin, and they're specifically targeting you...I have to admit, the first hundred-ish pages of this book had me wanting to pound my head against the wall. I've already mentioned the annoying product-placement stuff, though in a book this topical that's less of a problem; once people stop obsessing over bedbugs, this book is probably headed for the remainder outlets of bookstore chains, so one doesn't have to worry as much about the brand names one uses suddenly no longer existing if someone picks up the novel thirty years later (a major problem for younger readers of Stephen King novels these days, one thinks). And it's slow, slow, slow. Winters doesn't really start ramping up the tension until the family gets into the new place, and even then, he keeps it low-key until Susan's obsessions start getting her into the supernatural/crazy realm, at which point Winters shakes off the fetters, kicks out the jams, and sends this book into full-on seventies-crap-horror mode. At which point it becomes a real treat if you remember the subgenre, or if you're younger and have discovered it after the fact (hard to do considering how much of it is out of print these days, but there are great old used bookstores that can feed your habit for years. You may have to drive twelve hours to find one, but it's worth it...). Once you've fit the book into that framework, it all makes sense. I also have to give Winters points for not going completely off the rails with the ending. Obviously I can't really discuss what happens without major spoilers, but I'm not talking about the events so much as I am the atmosphere. In today's horror culture, this book would probably have been an easier sell if Winters went with an Eli Roth-esque ending (buckets of fake blood, etc.) instead of sticking with the seventies horror formula. But he did, and at least to me, that made a huge difference in how I saw the book as a whole; Winters obviously has a great affection for, and loyalty to, pulp horror, and in turn, that gave me a greater affection for, and loyalty to, Bedbugs. I hope this book isn't nearly as vertical-market as I think it is, and I hope even more that it grows a passion for those out-of-print pulp classics in a whole new generation of readers.

So a word of warning should you read this book \u2013 Do. Not. Read. It. At. Night. No seriously, the saying \u201csleep tight, don\u2019t let the bedbugs bite?\u201d \u2013 too true in this case. Analysis of plot:We start the story off with our main character Susan and Alex who move for various reasons and come upon a cheap apartment for rent, and they snap it up as Susan finds a bonus room to be perfect for her to start painting again. She feels like this is the room, and the house she wants. So after moving in, things start off at a dreary pace for the couple and child as they settle in, happy, meeting their eccentric landlord, and enjoying the new life they\u2019ve built. As far as horror stories, this is pretty clich\u00e9 right? Happy days, until terror strikes and while this book is no different in that style, it\u2019s different in a refreshing way.We find the pace picks up as the author Ben Winters introduces the idea that a series of bedbugs have been infesting in many houses in the area. That\u2019s where, it seems the problems all start. One morning, our main character wakes up to find a small dot of blood on her pillowcase, and slowly comes to the conclusion that perhaps their apartment has come under attack from bedbugs. After a series of events, Ben Winters turns the heat up as creepy events plague the house, one including Susan\u2019s new painting of a couple, and one morning, being found with a series of bug bites all over the paintings face and Susan has no recollection of doing it herself. I can honestly say, Ben Winters has a talent for creepy-ing out events as the description of what happened to the painting has my skin crawling and thinking about it now, it\u2019s doing the same. Such was Winter\u2019s fluid writing throughout, as he set the pace and slowly, so slowly that you didn\u2019t even realise it, he started to creep you out and plant seeds of doubt within your mind \u2013 which had me feeling like I had an itch somewhere on my arms. I loved his writing style as it was simple yet it got to you, and made you feel irked out. If you thought that a horror novel including the main villain being bedbugs couldn\u2019t creep you out \u2013 you will be proved wrong after reading this. The book ended .. well I won\u2019t let you in on that secret, let\u2019s just say along with a knack for scaring his readers, Ben Winters also had more than a few secrets up his sleeve which were revealed in the ending to this creeptastic book. Analysis of characters:While there weren\u2019t many characters in the story, I found myself taking a liking to the laughable old Louis, the repairman for the apartment that our main characters lived in. An ageing man who smiled, who looked in on the landlady as she was old and fraying, yet with a talent to fix anything with determination. You can\u2019t help but like his eagerness to fix whatever was bothering the tenants and this made me smile as in the end who tried to fix the biggest problem. Shan\u2019t so no more without giving it all away, yet the other characters, such as Susan, her husband Alex and her daughter Emma were well rounded characters who you could easily connect to. Overall:I still stand by the fact that this was a creeptacular book. Do not sit in bed at night reading it or else you will find yourself at the mercy of paranoia. I don\u2019t usually, if ever, get scared by a book, the sole exception being The Exorcists which had me reaching for my blankey. Yet this book will make your mind churn with the horrors within and definitely a book not to be taken lightly. Sleep tight people, and don\u2019t let the beg bugs bite. \nBlog\n | \nFacebook\n | \nTwitter\n | \nInstagram"}, {"userName": "Tabitha", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12224409-tabitha", "userReview": "Bedbugs is a horror novel narrated by an insomniac, unemployed mother who has anxiety problems. Told through Susan Wendt\u2019s impressions, the reader is never sure what is truth and what is imagined by this woman who is so influenced by media and her own insecurities. The novel blurs the line between reality and imagination at every turn \u2013 it is not until the very last chapter that the reader learns the true story and knows who to believe.The story begins with Susan Wendt searching for the perfect place for her family to live. Susan has recently quit her job at a law firm to pursue her painting. Her husband Alex makes decent money photographing jewelry and watches for a commercial company. Their daughter Emma is a well-adjusted child who is watched by a young nanny in the mornings and early afternoon. After months of searching, Susan has found a place that sounds too good to be true \u2013 it is a charming, two-story home in Brooklyn with a bonus room in which Susan can paint. The house is everything they have been looking for and they can afford it; they fall in love with it on sight. Susan even loves their landlord, an eccentric old woman named Andrea Scharfstein. Susan and Alex decide to move in.During the first night in the house, the reader learns that Susan is not as care-free and happy as she lets on. After her husband and daughter are fast asleep, Susan continues to unpack because she has terrible insomnia. She is sure that her husband resents her for not working and staying home to paint while he is stuck in a lousy job instead of taking artistic photographs, she chastises herself for not being able to paint and for wasting money on a nanny when she doesn\u2019t work, she thinks about her mother\u2019s untimely death\u2026all these self-deprecating thoughts make her unable to sleep. That first night she is sure she sees a man standing outside her daughter\u2019s window.Then things start to go very wrong with the house and her marriage. Alex is stressed about work and Susan blames herself; she starts having horrible nightmares filled with blood and gore. Susan begins to notice little problems with the house \u2013 there are cracks, loose outlet covers, uneven floorboards, and most bizarre of all \u2013 a faint pinging noise with no discernible source. When Susan finally steps into the bonus room to paint, there is a horrendous smell and a strange photograph with a bloody fingerprint. Andrea tells her the story of the couple who lived there before them, but something doesn\u2019t seem right to Susan. One day, Susan meets Louis \u2013 the elderly handyman and friend of Andrea\u2019s \u2013 and learns that there was a tragedy in the basement and a subsequent darkening of the houses\u2019 atmosphere. But all of this is just the beginning of Susan\u2019s terror-filled journey\u2026how much is reality and how much is a product of her anxious brain? Is she losing it or is there a menace in her home?Bedbugs is an intense and suspenseful narrative told from the perspective of a likable woman with glaring psychological issues. From the very beginning, the reader connects with Susan and feels like he truly knows her. He wants to trust her and believe her reality, but at the same time, his objectivity is constantly questioning her perceptions. This novel does a fantastic job of keeping the reader guessing - any time another clue is revealed it only adds to his confusion. This story is a real page-turner \u2013 the reader will be hooked until the very last page!"}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164688-paul", "userReview": "Sleep Tight.Susan and Alex Wendt are the prefect couple in search of the perfect brownstone \u2013 and they find their dream house in the heart of Brooklyn Heights. Sure, the landlady is eccentric, and the handyman drops cryptic remarks about the previous tenants. But the rent is so low; it\u2019s too good to pass up.Big mistake: Susan soon discovers the brownstone is crawling with bedbugs \u2013 or is it? She awakens every morning with fresh bites, but neither Alex nor their daughter Emma has a single welt. An exterminator searches the property and turns up nothing. The landlady insists the building is clean. Susan fears she\u2019s going mad \u2013 until a more sinister explanation presents itself: She may literally be confronting the bedbug problem from hell.On the face of it Susan and Alex have it all. He is a professional photographer with good prospects; she is an ex-lawyer who has given up her career to focus on her passion for painting. They have a toddler called Emma and are blissfully happy with their lot in life. The only fly in the ointment is that their current residence is just a little bit to small for them all to comfortably live in. Susan happens upon a listing for potential new home on the Internet and after a cursory visit, they decide to take a chance and move straight in. Everything seems fine at first but over the following weeks Susan becomes convinced that the new property has an infestation of bedbugs.The horror that you\u2019ll find in Bedbugs builds at a very slow, gradual pace. Is Susan imagining the whole thing? Is she losing her mind? This story is firmly focused on the torment of a single person. The intimacy in the narrative is the novel\u2019s strongest feature. The reader is present with Susan every step of the way and gets a grandstand view of her as she starts to come apart at the seams. As Susan becomes more and more anxious about the situation her fragile mental state starts to affect her relationship with Alex and everyone else around her.I particularly enjoyed the internal conversations Susan has with herself, the rational and irrational coming together and battling it out in her head. Ben Winters has a great eye for detail and a good ear for dialogue. The whole of the Wendt family seem very real. Alex, Susan and Emma could be any young upwardly mobile family in New York. Their interactions are believable and very natural.I was reminded of the best episodes of The Twilight Zone. Susan\u2019s escalating doubts over the state of her sanity, and everyone\u2019s initial indifference to her plight has a classic feel. I think it also helps that there is something marvelously creepy about insects. As the novel heads towards its climax, there are enough unpleasant situations that will make the most stout of heart exclaim \u2018Ick\u2019 or \u2018Arghhh\u2019 out loud.Bedbugs is only around two hundred and fifty pages long and I think it is safe to say this falls into the quick read category. If you enjoy psychological horror that you can rattle through in a couple of easy sittings this would be a good choice.I have a confession to make. While reading this book I did find myself feeling a little bit itchier than normal. I assume that this is normal? I defy anyone to not feel the same.Bedbugs by Ben Winters is published in the UK by Quirk Books 0n 6th September 2011."}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/267866-audrey", "userReview": "Susan is dying to move into a bigger place in Brooklyn, but doesn\u2019t know if she and her husband will be able to afford it since she\u2019s recently quit her lawyer job to take up painting. Then, the perfect apartment becomes available, and with such a low price, they move in immediately. Everything seems wonderful, except for the room Susan has chosen to be her studio. As her concerns with the apartment grow, so does the strain on their relationship and domestic situation. And Susan is also waking up with mysterious bites. Bedbugs are running rampant, but it seems that she is the only one who can see them or is getting bitten. Susan is left to question whether they are really bedbugs, or something more demonic.I wanted to like this book. It had all the trappings of a fun psychological thriller, with dark tones and was capitalizing on a recent American fear. Who hasn\u2019t heard the sensationalist stories of bed bugs in New York hotels? Plus, many people are very afraid of insects, so the thought of tiny creepy crawlies can result in the kind of book you don\u2019t want to read at night.Unfortunately, I had a hard time getting through it. The main character, Susan, was really annoying to me. She\u2019s always complaining about something, yet she doesn\u2019t work and doesn\u2019t ever paint, even though they\u2019re paying a nanny to watch her daughter during the day to free her up for making her art. And even though they\u2019re struggling to make ends meet on her husband\u2019s salary, she\u2019s constantly going out to eat and even goes to the salon for a manicure, pedicure, and wax. I just kept feeling like this is an example of what is wrong with America. The book would have worked much better for me if she would have been a person I could root for, instead of against.There was also repeated mention of something that happened at the beginning of the book (not a spoiler). She notes that a mother pushed her twin babies off of a rooftop, killing them. I kept expecting the story to cycle back to this, to tie it in in some way, but it didn\u2019t. It was just there, maybe meant to flavor the novel? I couldn\u2019t tell, but it irked me that it never was worked into the larger plot.Things got better about 2/3 of the way through. It seemed that the book was really going to go the psychological route, which pleased me greatly. The tension increased, and Susan began having \u201cissues.\u201d Then, the entire spirit of the book did a big 180. I don\u2019t know why he did it, but the bedbugs ended up being something entirely different than the story was working them up to be, and it didn\u2019t work for me. The ending left me feeling absolutely incredulous, and very unhappy that I had invested so much time for such a poor payout.I think this book will find its audience, but that audience was not me. I also think that Winters writes well, and the idea for the story was really good. It came down to characterization and ending for me, which bummed me out.

I felt like bedbugs were crawling all over me - YUCK!! So, it really was the perfect way to kick off Carl's, R.I.P. VI Challenge. There was a bit of the supernatural mixed in with some crazy people and tons of creepy crawly blood suckers swarming about to make you itch and gasp in surprise. Bedbugs tells the story of the Wendts - Susan (wife), Alex (husband), and Emma (daughter) - a small family looking for a dream home in a better neighborhood. Susan wants space to set up an art studio where she can paint and Alex wants a kitchen big enough so that he can cook up gourmet meals for his family. All they want is a good school for their daughter and parks nearby where she can run and play. Oh, and a monthly rental payment that will still leave them with money to spare. Talk about pipe dreams, right? Especially considering that they live in NYC, where rent is anything but cheap. Well, consider Alex, Susan, and Emma extremely lucky, because thanks to the internet, it looks like they have struck gold - a brownstone apartment in Brooklyn Heights for under $4000 a month ( aka DREAM HOME). After checking out the place and talking with the landlady, Alex and Susan decide to go for it and are soon faxing over a signed copy of the lease. The topic of bedbugs does come up, but only as an afterthought. Soon boxes are being moved and excitement fills the air. Life for the Wendts appears to be good. They are adjusting to their new digs and the surrounding area nicely. Alex is working crazy hours, Susan has set up an art studio and Emma has made friends in the park - everything is moving along smoothly. Until a tiny speck of blood appears on Susan's pillowcase one morning. Bedbugs! The thought crosses her mind rather fleetingly, but she pushes it away and chalks up the stain to paint. However, strange things begin to happen that start to make Susan think that maybe her house isn't as bug-free as she had thought. As the story progresses, bites are discovered, exterminators are called, accusations are thrown and a family is torn apart. Oh, and some pretty creepy stuff begins to happen that makes you wonder if the house is haunted or if Susan is possessed and doesn't even know it. You even start to wonder about the old handyman who takes care of the property and the dotty old landlady, whose moods shift at the drop of a hat. Now, I'm not going to provide any more details, except to say that the ending will definitely leave you SURPRISED - and feeling itchy all over. Bedbugs was a good, fun, and creepy read. The writing was solid, the storyline current and the characters were caricatures of people you probably know in real life (so they were interesting to read about) - overall a good book to have on a rainy fall day.

The thing is, we're all that type of person, aren't we? Winters' novel starts out with a happy(ish) young family ready to move to a bigger place. New Yorkers might think that's basis enough for a horror novel! Winters does a lovely job of creating characters who are likable and believable, and the first half of the novel moves along at a steady clip. The family (Susan, Alex and Emma) find a place that seems to good to be true and move in. Then they find out why it is too good to be true. Now, I should mention that I currently have a case of poison ivy, but it's really not so bad...or at least it wasn't, until the appearance of the bedbugs in this tale. I wish I could pinpoint exactly how Winters did it, but it was remarkably subtle. I was reading quite happily and suddenly my scalp was itching, my stomach, my arms, my feet. You would think they slipped itching powder inside the book!I greatly enjoyed reading this. It was actually a bit of serendipity that I picked it up at Book Expo this week, because I only saw it as I was waiting in line for a different book. However, the book that I was waiting for has remained in Mt. To-Be-Read, and I finished Bedbugs in two days. What does that tell you?This section contains SPOILERS:My only complaint about the book is the inclusion of Anna Mara Lynch, the Medea-type character. I feel like her role in the story, though tangential to the main characters, should have been resolved in some fashion. In the end, I was left wondering why she was included. Her actions made for horrifying nightmares for Susan, but ultimately, I think her only purpose in the story was to make us fear for Emma's life. The story is pretty successful in not letting you know who the villains and victims are, but I felt like that piece of the book was manipulation rather than masterful writing."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2850786-jennifer", "userReview": "Bedbugs is a thoroughly creepy read. It's not horrific in the way we commonly think of the horror genre. Bedbugs gets into your psyche, instilling a paranoia that will have you scratching incessantly while convinced you just saw a bug out of the corner of your eye.I loved the family in Bedbugs and would have enjoyed their characters in any story. I particularly \"got\" Susan, a woman who has recently quit her job to pursue her dream of being an artist. She and her husband have a daughter, with a nanny that comes during the week so Susan can work on her art. Susan struggles with the guilt of being home and still employing a nanny, as well as feeling her husband resents her for not working while his business is struggling. She's a character most women will easily understand, because at one time or another we've all suffered from a version of mommy-guilt or wife-guilt. Also, with no history or mental illness or hypochondria, she sees bedbugs while others swear there aren't any. This too will be relateable for many, since most people have experienced a version of hypochondria, however minor, in their lives at least once.Bedbugs is scary, especially because you don't know where the story is going. With a title like Bedbugs, you'd think the matter would be pretty self-explanatory. I personally pictured one of those creature movies Syfy always features. This definitely wasn't the case. The story takes unexpected turns that surprise and work very well in the plot as a whole.Bedbugs frightens because the idea of being infested by tiny bloodsucking insects is traumatic and very possible, especially now when outbreaks of bedbugs are often in the news. Bedbugs is relevant and will make your skin crawl."}, {"userName": "Franci Franci", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6923793-franci-franci", "userReview": "Una lettura che mi ha incollato al letto e successivamente alla poltrona in meno di due giorni e che vi consiglio di non leggere prima di andare a dormire se ci tenete a prender sonno.I personaggi di questa storia all'inizio non si sono conquistati la mia simpatia: Susan cos\u00ec ansiosa,che deve tenere tutto sotto controllo,Alex che \u00e8 un uomo di quelli che in casa non muove un dito (tv e lavoro),Andrea,la padrona di casa,la babysitter che trovo insopportabile,perch\u00e8 sembra che prenda per i fondelli Susan....l'unica che ha fatto breccia fin da subito nel mio cuore \u00e8 stata la piccola Emma,cos\u00ec dolce,spensierata e intelligente.E' solo col tempo che ho cominciato ad apprezzare anche Susan,conoscendo il suo passato e ci\u00f2 che le accadr\u00e0.Ritmo incalzante,capace di far venire i brividi dopo poche pagine e coinvolgente,perch\u00e8 fino alla fine si cerca di capire se Susan sta diventando pazza per colpa dei medicinali che prende per l'ansia,se le cimici ci siano davvero,ma allora perch\u00e8 non le vede nessuno,tranne lei,o se il motivo sia un altro.Non vedevo l'ora di leggere questo romanzo,ma allo stesso tempo conoscendomi,pensavo di cominciare ad aver fifa dopo poco,quindi rimandavo il suo inizio,ma ho fatto male perch\u00e8 potevo leggere questa bella storia molto tempo prima,per il fatto che ci troviamo davanti un thriller psicologico,che lascia un senso di angoscia,pi\u00f9 che di paura,finch\u00e8 non si sbroglia la matassa.L'autore riesce a far rappresentare nella mente del lettore l'intera vicenda e il senso di angoscia viene sollecitato anche dalle tre parti,in cui compaiono via via sempre pi\u00f9 cimici dei letti,fino a riempire completamente la pagina che precede il seguito del racconto.Infine,la cover mi piace perch\u00e8 \u00e8 cupa e rappresenta l'inizio dell'incubo."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4334134-laura", "userReview": "Susan and Alex Wendt are on the hunt for a new apartment, but living in the city and finding afforable housing is hard to overcome, so when they find a beautiful and extremely afforable brownstone in Brooklyn it seems too good to be true, but how could it be? With the sweet widowed landlord living downstairs, and the handman Larry, who is there at their wake and call for anything that goes aray.So why then is Susan waking up with Bites, and seeing bedbugs attacking her, while nobody else in her family seems to be effected. When a well-renowned exterminator to the stars, gives the apartment the all clear, is when Susan really stars to get fearful, because she feels her visions and the bites are getting 10x worse, and her husband and doctor are starting to think she's a little crazy??What is it about this apartment and the Badbugs, or bedbugs that Susan can't seem to shake? This story in my opinion could have been super cheesy with this concept, but it wasn't that at all. Ben Winters made this story so creepy, and fantastic that I couldn't put it down. It was creepy and gave me the creepy-crawly feeling, but not to the point where I was up all night with nightmares (which is not a bad thing, in my opinion). The ending of this story is absoultly fantastic, and unexpected. I had no idea that they story was going to take a turn in the direction, but It was so good, and was happy with how the book played out. I cannot say enough good things about this book, if you want a creepy, halloweenish read, go pick up BEDBUGS, the book not the bug! haha"}], "description": "FOR RENT: Top two floors of beautifully renovated brownstone, 1300 sq. ft., 2BR 2BA, eat-in kitchen, one block to parks and playgrounds.
