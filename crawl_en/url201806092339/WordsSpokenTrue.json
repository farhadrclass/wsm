It is without a doubt the most romantic book I've written for the inspirational market and perhaps for any market. I enjoyed the newspaper background and the historical setting in 1855 Louisville. I do hope readers will like getting to know Adriane Darcy and Blake Garrett as they compete to be first with the headlines of the day. I always feel a little strange rating my own books, but then again, every story I'm given is amazing in its own way. Certainly if I didn't like my characters, I wouldn't be able to tell their stories for others to read. And I did like writing about Adriane and Blake."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11105817-alicia", "userReview": "You can't go wrong with an Ann H. Gabhart book! This had a different (but good) feel to it than some of her other books, maybe because the story took place in a big city instead of a small town. A lot happened in this book- there was a murder mystery, political riots, a terribly determined fianc\u00e9e, a heroic suitor\u2026and all of it came together to form a marvelous story. 4.5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416312-ruth", "userReview": "In an era when most women were schooled in drawing room arts with an eye to making a good marriage, Adriane Darcy was practically raised in the rough-and-tumble environment of her father's newspaper offices. Adriane practically has ink flowing in her veins, fuelling her passion for the truth and getting the news to the public. When Blake Garrett, a bold editor from New York, arrives in Louisville and takes over the opposing newspaper, a war of words erupts between Blake and Adriane's father over headlines and politics, with the very future of Louisville hanging in the balance. Adriane is torn between her undeniable attraction to the interloper and loyalty to her father and their paper, but when her father's political alliances see Adriane forced into an engagement to the son of one of the city's most powerful families, her resolve to remain loyal to her father begins to waver. With her very future hanging in the balance, Adriane's fight for her freedom, her very individuality, collides with rising tensions in the volatile Louisville political climate, threatening everything she holds dear. Her father's biggest rival emerges as her greatest ally, but can she trust his motivations?Words Spoken True marks my first time to read a novel by Gabhart, and to say I was impressed would be a bit of an understatement. *wink* I was expecting a typical historical romance, what I received instead was a novel evoking the rich history and volatile political climate of the pre-Civil War South, complete with a dash of romance and a page-turning, suspenseful murder investigation. Gabhart touches on everything from the impact of the burgeoning women's rights movement and abolition to the rise in tension between the largely Protestant population of Louisville and the influx of Catholic immigrants, both parties eager to jockey for political power and precedence. The simmering political conflict leading up the 1855 election and Bloody Monday riots is the perfect backdrop for a tale featuring warring newspapers, particularly in a time when newspapers and fiery editorials were the method of choice for informing -- and swaying -- public opinion. Add the ever-present threat of a Jack the Ripper-esque killer targeting vulnerable Irish girls, and the result is a page-turning read that richly evokes a time period not often examined in my experience when it comes to fiction.I really loved the character of Adriane. Gabhart did an excellent job making her a strong, unique heroine grappling with societal expectations and familial pressure in a very realistic way that felt authentic to the time. Blake and his hunger for justice makes him a worthy counterpart to Adriane, and the two share a deliciously spicy attraction. However, I do wish that more time had been devoted to developing the growth of a relationship between Blake and Adriane. In a scant sixth-month time frame the two share the barest handful of face-to-face encounters, making their relationship, when political events kick into high gear in the final third of the novel, strain the bounds of credulity. That qualm aside, in addition to Adriane and Blake Gabhart peppers their world with a host of colorful supporting characters, from the eager Irish paper boy Duff to loyal typesetter Beck, the latter Adriane's introduction to faith. I really appreciated Gabhart's fearlessness in touching on issues not often found in historical fiction of this ilk, from the effect of childhood emotional abuse to the dangers of perverted obsession. Words Spoken True is the best kind of reading surprise -- a spicy romance with an unexpectedly strong suspense thread, set against the backdrop of a city on the cusp of profound change. A memorable introduction to Gabhart's fiction, this is an author definitely on my radar now!"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2790490-katie", "userReview": "First posted on my blog, Legacy of a Writer.Oh my goodness, what a beautiful historical fiction that will completely keep you on your toes! I\u2019ve read two of Ann Gabhart\u2019s books in the past, and thought I knew the kind of fiction she writes. But she completely surprised\u2014and delighted\u2014me with Words Spoken True. I wasn\u2019t expecting this historical to be so...suspenseful!! I stayed up late into the night, unable to stop reading.Adriane is a very strong heroine that I liked from the very first scene\u2014when she snuck away in the middle of the night to get the scoop on a murder. Her desire to do the right thing, to obey her father, and to make her father proud of her work really brought her to life. Oh, and I really grew to like Blake! I love the go-getter nature that drove him! And Blake and Adriane\u2019s verbal battles were so hilarious!All that said, there are a few scenes that would keep me from recommending this to younger readers. There are a few intimate scenes between husband and wife, and then there's a bedroom scene when newlyweds consummating their marriage (the husband helping his wife undress and then taking in her beauty). The scene doesn't cut off when they actually consummate it, but the author skips over the actual act. Depending on the reader, this might be okay or not.The story starts off at a good pace, and consistently builds tension as the story progresses until, at a little over half way, I was reading as fast as I could to find out what would happen next. There was even a little mystery over a serial killer known as the \"river slasher\" that added a neat mix into the story. When I reached the end of this book and read the last page...I immediately knew this book would go on my favorites shelf! What a historical read!"}, {"userName": "Susanhayeshotmail.com", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2712657-susanhayeshotmail-com", "userReview": "Please keep in mind that a three star rating for me means \"it was okay\" and I will admit that I dithered between two, I didn't like it, and three stars for the entire book. I was recently at the library and in a bit of a hurry and asked for a recommendation. My good Library Lady Shelia said this had come with great recommendations but admitted she hadn't read it. Being in a hurry and lazy I took it home with me despite premonitions of disappointment based on the back cover mention of the author being a Christian writer and, I have to admit, the cover. I did not look like my kind of book or sound like my kind of book and yes, I do frequently judge books by their covers ... and their titles ... and the back cover blurbs. Words Spoken True was not terrible and I would recommend it to fans of Christian fiction and younger readers, teens? It's clean and that's refreshing and as a Christian myself I appreciated the delicate touch with faith and prayer but I have some buts. The best, most interesting historical bits were found in the introduction. The mystery was just never a mystery - saw the answer to that one coming from way, way off. Ditto the romance. Which is largely why I don't like romances. It was a lite and easy read. I finished it and I didn't hate it but I sure didn't like it either so I'm still dithering on the star factor, as is so often the case, and am just wishing for half stars.

All those things drew me to read this free Amazon Kindle book, but all those aforementioned elements were executed mediocre at best. Perhaps I am too harsh a critic, since other reviewers seemed to like it, but that is my opinion, take it or leave it.Regarding the heroine, I felt like she was so inconsistent. She had this vibe as the independent newspaper lady with gumption and a fiery tongue, but then she'd turn into someone different, someone who didn't stand up for herself very well, someone who would even consider marrying someone like what's-his-face. The murder mystery wrap-up was contrived, and I felt like the author left too many loose ends. The love story had a decent beginning and early-middle, but from there on I wasn't impressed with the development of their relationship. I read a review that said the book was slow building, and then she was hooked. I felt the opposite. I was drawn in rather quickly, but then the story line seemed to unravel. Too many things were formulaic and contrived. I kept waiting for a decent ending, but that failed me too.So overall?

It gets bumped down a notch because the lovebirds did confess their love without knowing much about each other and emotions were \"exploding\" out of eyes all over the place, but it was a good read with some often overlooked historical substance, full of conflict and tension, and hard to put down."}, {"userName": "Margaret Chind", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226769-margaret-chind", "userReview": "Never were words spoken so true... *sigh* Is that not something that you just love, after reading a book that interruptions left you thirsting for more, where each page could not turn fast enough to bring what was next, but you wanted to take your time to soak it all in. Oh what a character I have found in Blake Garrett and while I was a fan of Adriane Darcy from page one, goodness what a great cast!As you can tell from the back cover book blurb, Adriane agrees to marry Stanley Coleman, a man she does not love because of her father's wishes and his idea that romantic love is not necessary for a happy life. What saddness! Romantic hearts unite! Sorry... tangent in my mind. As a reader that loves a good heart smiling romance, I think that only the broken or never in love could ever contemplate spending a life without it. What a shame! Throughout the story, as a reader I want to scream at Adriane to run and I truly wonder if she will... She keeps reminding herself of honor thy father and that it is a good enough reason to stay with Stanley even if her heart tells her otherwise. That is such a difficult concept, but one that I think people deal with daily. Not only did God give us the concept of honoring thy father and mother, but he also gave them the task of teaching their children and protecting them from harm. Parents are a guardian on earth put to charge of their children for the short time that they have them as keen pupils. We are their responsibility and when parents take out the purpose of what is best for their child and give guidance that cannot be what God had in mind and it pretty much nullifies that principle in my opinion.Reading about the experiences that Adriane had with her stepmother makes me cringe and at the same time wonder. It seems that Adriane was stuck in the past and needed to break free, and I think that perhaps was another reason why she did not see a point to following her heart. Her father perhaps just was so unhappy with his own lack of finding love that he thought to just accept the mediocre in life and left that as an understanding of what she should expect. It is neat however to find that the characters branch out with other people that find an important role in her life and seeing how they grow and shape her through out the story is a fascinating thing. Even while she loves her father, but does not agree with him in certain things it appears that perhaps in the role of father there might actually be more than one to provide love and advice. While I'm on the thought of different characters, my goodness Mrs. Wiggenham and Grace! However do I love you right off the pages! Now I want to know when someone can pitch this novel to be like a BBC drama? Um please?! I can see it.Now for the romance. *sigh* I mean wait, did you hear me the first two times? *sigh* Oh the attraction of the heart and soul and how it develops. Love is a fascinating thing and it radiated off the pages of this book. My husband always knows when I've found a good romance in a book and he teases me about it, but oh please more books like this. I'm talking Julie Lessman love in the soul and mind. (Never fear, we're still talking Christian Fiction here, it's all chaste and all just as it should be.)I do not know much about Kentucky outside of Laura Frantz novels and again not much about immigration issues outside of New York riots, but it was fascinating to read a novel that already had enough of it's own battle in people to find itself set in such a volatile political era. Sociology is a scary thing... Makes me want to go watch Newsies. All in all, I'm a new fan for Ann H. Gabhart and this book finds itself to my favorites. While the parts leading to the ending were not my favorite part of the book it all else made it worth the read.*Thanks to Revell Books for providing a copy for review.*\u201cAvailable February 2012 at your favorite bookseller from Revell, a division of Baker Publishing Group.\u201dRead Chapter 1 on Ann's website.posted: http://creativemadnessmama.com/blog/2..."}, {"userName": "Lisa Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7092311-lisa-johnson", "userReview": "Title: Words Spoken TrueAuthor: Ann H. Gabhart www.annhgabhart.comPages: 368Year: 2012Publisher: RevellNote: This blogger gratefully acknowledges the gift of the book for the review signed by the author. Other reviews are located at http://seekingwithallyurheart.blogspo...\tDo you like history? How do you like to read historical events? Some like to read history in biographical form, others in autobiographical. There are some who like to read small pieces of history too. However, what about a historical event written in fiction format? I can tell you as a reader this is one that is a favorite of mine. I have found there have been many events, both great and small, I never would have known existed if it were not for writers putting the event onto paper for readers of all ages.\tAnn H. Gabhart\u2019s recent book, Words Spoken True, is enthralling to say the least. The story is set in Louisville, Kentucky during the early 1850\u2019s. During this time, there occurred divisions among various nationalities, religious affiliations, political views, and believe it or not the written word of newspapers. There didn\u2019t exist the multitude of inventions such as radio, internet, television, or phones. People learned about the \u201chappenings\u201d by the printed words in a newspaper and got them from the young lads who ran around to sell them to anyone who wanted to know what was going on.\tThe novel Words Spoken True contains a variety of characters with lives affected and intertwined in many ways. There are two main newspapermen who start their newspapers and are rivals in many ways. Add to that the distrust of those who seek to control the press as they do not want some events in print and other happenings they do want printed, depending on who will gain an advantage. Editorials are written like two sparring boxers, taking their views about people or occurrences and putting them on paper as if they are actually looking their opponent in the face.\tWe have in this fictional story a girl named Adriane Darcy, who runs a newspaper with her father. He had owned it at one time. Why now does she have to marry someone she doesn\u2019t love in order to save their beloved newspaper? Their competitor, Mr. Chestnut, hires as an editor, Mr. Blake, assuring him he can write and print anything he wants. That promise is almost rescinded because what is being printed is threatening the current political race. As you continue to read, there are at odds those people who want to win political seats. In order to do so, they are keeping other people from voting. Who were those who couldn\u2019t vote? Well, I can\u2019t let the \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d and ruin it for you!\tAlso taking place in the book, is a murderer who is ruthlessly killing young Irish girls, but who and why he is doing this don\u2019t become apparent too soon in the novel. While hints are revealed in the story, everything comes to a head in a way that keeps the reader engaged until the very end.Love is also an important part of the story as is the Word of God. Ann H. Gabhart\u2019s novel is magnificent as well as superbly telling a true historical event inside a fictional story. Words Spoken True is the second of two novels in this genre to receive a 5+ star rating from this reader. With spring here and opportunities to get outside and enjoy the beauty, grab this book, a chair and a cold drink. This is one story you want to read while enjoying the great outdoors!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10732829-rebecca", "userReview": "A well-deserved five stars; this story has a wonderful blend of fabulous characters, interesting history, captivating suspense, heart-throbbing romance and poignant spiritual encouragement. Adrianne Darcy is a force to be reckoned with; beautiful on the outside and a fierce competitor on the inside. But Adrianne's spirit is being strangled within a choke-hold of expectations by the one person whom she holds dearest; her beloved father; owner and editor of one of Louisville's most prestigious newspapers, the \"Tribune\". When Adrianne learns that her father has literally \"sold\" her off to marry Stanley Jimson in order to escape the paper's debts and push forward a popular political agenda, she resigns herself to \"honor her father\" and ignore her heart. Blake Garrett, editor of the \"Herald\", is determined to give everyone in Louisville a \"voice\" through the printed page. In the process, he has nearly overtaken Wade Darcy's newspaper in readership; primarily by reporting about the senseless murders of young, innocent Irish girls by a serial killer dubbed \"the slasher\". He is slow to get involved in the political fray of 1855, but is being recognized as a worthy opponent in the newspaper business. Blake's heart nearly stops when he meets the lovely Adrianne; and the attraction is obviously mutual, but seemingly impossible to pursue. The remainder of this wonderful book takes its readers through many portals; the harsh, violent political struggles of the era, the courage that it takes to follow one's heart in the midst of a desperate situation, the love of family to the point of death, the act of faith to love unconditionally, the terror of being stalked and the reassurance of God's power to defeat fear and darkness. It's an absolutely unforgettable read!"}, {"userName": "Caitlyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41063610-caitlyn", "userReview": "90% through and all appears well, then out of the blue Chapter 28, happens. Well, I started reading a \"chaste\" romance novel and I'm pretty sure that sexual scene goes against it. Needless to say when you through a random scene like that in a book, you automatically increase the maturity rating. If I wanted to read books with that content, I would grab a ROMANCE novel that doesn't appear chaste, but I don't enjoy that content in books I read. Basically, all I wanted was a clean and enjoyable novel, and I got something else. I rated this two stars because I enjoyed most of the 90% I read, in fact before Chapter 28 happened I would've given it four stars. . .But Chapter 28 happened, and this reader is not happy. If you want to read a book with basically the same plot (see this book isn't even original, except for the two rival newspaper reporters falling in love that may be a twist): girl is engaged to seemingly weak rich guy that she thinks of as a friend, not marriage material. Then is forced into marriage mainly due to her father's debt, after she meets handsome intriguing stranger, who she starts to fall for, and he falls for her. Seemingly weak man is actually force to be reckoned with. Read Making Waves it is actually chaste, plus it's book 1 in a trilogy that is actually pretty clean as well. In conclusion, appearances and covers are often misleading, and this book being marketed as chaste or appearing chaste is all an illusion.

There was so much conflict and tension surrounding the romance it was hard to put the book down. It captured my attention from page 1 all the way to the end, and kept me guessing (or growling in frustration) almost the whole way.BUT...What I didn't like: In the second half of the book, there is a period of mature content. I've read other books that cut short such scenes and still got the same idea across. I prefer the tactful route.Also, the mystery (while intriguing) was about a violent crime; this wouldn't have bothered me as much if there had been a little less detail and if it hadn't gotten personal for the heroine in the end.One other thing that bothered me (though I may the only one), was that the whole book is pro-truth, the hero is dedicated to publishing truth, the very title encourages thoughts of telling the truth, and then in the end (without giving things away) a compromise is made, and a half-truth is given. I really felt like certain people should not have gotten off so easily.All this said, my experience reading this book really was one filled with excitement and intrigue.

Further, as I try to become a novelist, as I read I constantly edit and recall bits of writing advice that the book is failing to live up to. This one was different. It is the first book in recent memory where I got so lost in it that I literally did not hear my husband speaking to me. And this happened more than once (much to his frustration). And I did not edit as I went. I just... enjoyed. I enjoyed the tension between the two love interests, and, as always, I liked reading about a time and place in history that I didn't know much about (1855 Louisville).Now, if I were to look for things to complain about, I could find them. First, the mystery ... well... it wasn't. I could see the answer coming a mile away. And a couple of plot points (including the timing of one of the most one major ones) were difficult for me to accept as plausible, but I forgive Ms. Gabhart.

Gabhart introduces Adriane Darcy and Blake Garrett in a beautifully written novel, Words Spoken True, about two rival newspaper companies competing to be the best newspaper in town, when things take a turn for the deadly. Words Spoken True is a riveting tale of murder, love, and discovering what really matters; and the first book by Ann H. Gabhart that I have had the pleasure of picking up.I loved Adriane because she is a strong, unique heroine. She isn't necessarily reflective of women and their place in society in her time era, but I felt that it worked for this book, and allowed Adriane to stand out as a character. I also loved Blake (well it took some time getting to that point - at first I was somewhat annoyed with him), and how he wasn't afraid of what people deemed right or wrong, he did what he felt was right. Adriane's and Blake's personalities clicked very well together, and you could see the chemistry present between them. But I feel that you don't really see the love in the pages - they tell each other they love one another, but it didn't feel real.There was also a lot going on in this novel, besides the political unrest mentioned in the synopsis; such as a murder mystery and a threat closer to Adriane then she could have ever imagined. I thoroughly enjoyed the murder mystery, although I was able to figure out who the murderer was much sooner than the character's in the story. Words Spoken True has a way of submerging you into the past with the historical accuracy and Ann H. Gabhart's descriptions of the events that took place in Louisville during the 1850s.Words Spoken True was an amazing introduction to Ann H. Gabhart, and I look forward to reading more by this author as soon as possible. Although, I would definitely recommend this novel, I would like to say that there are some more intimate scenes in the book between a husband and wife that isn't necessarily inappropriate in my opinion because it fades out for the majority, but it's something to be aware of if you decide to pick this book up."}, {"userName": "Rachel Brand", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/572197-rachel-brand", "userReview": "GENRE: HISTORICAL ROMANCEPUBLISHER: REVELLPUBLICATION DATE: FEBRUARY 01, 2012 RATING: 4.5 OUT OF 5 \u2013 EXCELLENTPROS: Unconventional father figure; excellent historical detail; perfect portrayal of romance and chemistry between the hero and heroineCONS: Romance relies too much on the premise of \u201clove at first sight\u201dAdriene Darcy has worked alongside her father in the printing room for his newspaper since she was a young girl, and now that she\u2019s of an age to be married, she would still rather be setting type than attending balls and society functions. But her father has different ideas, and when the son of one of Lousville\u2019s most prestigious families asks for her hand in marriage he readily agrees, without Adriene\u2019s consent. Adriene has no desire to be married off, especially to Stanley Jimson, who isn\u2019t as safe and gentle as he initially appears. The only other person determined to keep Adriene from marrying Stanley is Blake Garrett, the editor of the rival Lousville newspaper. He doesn\u2019t trust Stanley, and even if Adriene is the daughter of his rival, Blake can\u2019t deny the attraction he feels for her. When the actions of the Know Nothing party stir up political unrest at the local elections Adriene and Blake are thrown together, as Adriene\u2019s father ends up in the middle of the chaos and Blake\u2019s newspaper office is attacked by those who oppose his political beliefs. Can they, and their respective newspapers, survive the tumult ripping Louisville apart? Prior to Words Spoken True I had only read one novel from Ann H. Gabhart, and that was The Outsider, the first book in her Shaker series. I\u2019d initially expected that The Outsider would be a standard romance novel, in a similar vein to Amish fiction, and was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the historical detail that the book contained. While some people may just read historical romances for the old-fashioned style of courtship and relationships that they present, I prefer my historical novels to actually contain some history. Words Spoken True certainly lived up to the expectations that The Outsider had set and satisfied the historian in me. The novel had the added bonus of detailing several aspects of the printing process which I had studied about the previous semester at university, so I can vouch that Ann has done her research in this department.This is certainly not a book for those who want their historical novels to give a couple of passing references to outdoor toilets and wagon trains and little more, but neither is it alienating to those of you who aren\u2019t studying for your undergraduate degree in History. The issues that Words Spoken True discusses regarding the Know Nothing party and immigration are ones that I imagine every American reader has some basic knowledge of from high school history, and if not, Ann briefly outlines the issues discussed in a foreword to the book. But the authenticity that the novel evokes is worth the attention to detail in Words Spoken True, which helps the reader to become invested in the political rivalries that play out throughout the novel. I was slightly surprised to find that Ann presented Adriene\u2019s father as a follower of the Know Nothing ideology who was scornful of immigrants, as it didn\u2019t fit the typical image of fathers that is put forth by historical romances. In a way, it was a pleasant change to have a father who wasn\u2019t a hundred-percent supportive of his daughter, nor a model, politically-correct citizen in the twenty-first century sense. While my father never tried to marry me off to the son of his business partner, I\u2019ll admit that he isn\u2019t perfect, and sometimes the parents in historical romances do seem a little too perfect in the way that they support their children. Especially in a period when women were still seen as somewhat of a commodity, it\u2019s probably quite realistic that Wade Darcy didn\u2019t agree with his daughter staying home and working at the family business forever and wanted to see her married by a certain age. And the fact that he supported the Know Nothing party reminds readers that those who shared such beliefs weren\u2019t necessarily monsters; a trap that it is far too easy to fall into when we\u2019re viewing events in hindsight.Romance fans need not fear, for the romantic aspect of this novel isn\u2019t neglected amidst all the historical detail and political unrest. I did feel that the romance between Adriene and Blake was a bit slow to start, and that because they spent so little time together initially it seemed like their relationship relied too much on the \u201clove at first sight\u201d idea. Personally, I\u2019m never a fan of \u201clove at first sight\u201d romances and prefer relationships that blossom slowly over time to those that are hastily jump-started due to intense chemistry. Adriene and Blake\u2019s relationship did do a sudden jump forward partway through the book, but it was actually at this point that I started to really like their relationship. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but I will say that the way that Ann portrayed the romance and chemistry between Adriene and Blake reminded me of the edginess of the relationship between the newly married couple in Kelly Long\u2019s Lilly\u2019s Wedding Quilt. There\u2019s nothing at all inappropriate or explicit in Words Spoken True, and I commend Ann for portraying a loving yet intense romance with an appropriate amount of sexual tension. Although I was initially sceptical about Adriene and Blake\u2019s relationship, this part of the story more than made up for it.While I\u2019m not a fan of romances which rely on the concept of \u201clove at first sight\u201d and do wish that readers had been given more time to see Adriene and Blake\u2019s relationship developing, I found that the more I thought about this book after I finished it, the more I loved it. Not only was the historical detail of Words Spoken True well-researched, but it propelled the story forward with each event and made for an unconventional but incredibly engaging romance. If you like the history in your romance novels to be more than just a backdrop and to subtly weave in and out of the plot, then Words Spoken True is definitely the novel for you. The combination of the depth of the historical detail and the edginess of Adriene and Blake\u2019s relationship gives me high hopes for Anna\u2019s forthcoming novels.Review title provided by Revell."}, {"userName": "Brandi", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29779860-brandi", "userReview": "3.5 stars (overall 4)NOTE: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.I enjoyed this novel for the most part.The plot intrigued me and I soon found myself lost within the pages. The spark that smoldered between Blake and Adriane kept a smile on my face. The action stapled me to the edge of my proverbial seat.But... there was a time when I was jerked from the pages. Near the end of this novel, the two main characters became husband and wife. And it wasn't one of those in-name-only deals, if you know what I mean. While it certainly didn't go so far as to detail the extent of their union, it did depict more that necessary and left this reader more than a little uncomfortable. Beautiful story, but I would have been satisfied without the married part. A little TMI for Christian fiction.This is the first novel I've read by Ann H.

I really wanted to like this book, I really did. It was darker than I thought it would be, and had more sexy stuff than I would have expected. I would have to say 15+ or 16+ for the sexual content. The main bad guy was seriously evil and talked to his fianc\u00e9 about \"taking\" her before their wedding night. He also attempts to rape a character (this is completely undetailed, but still implied), he also stabs girls to death after having sex with them (again this is implied, they don't outright say that he has sex with them). The main character and her husband have sex (undetailed, but still there) and at first the main character is afraid of what happens on the wedding night. The mystery of the book was good, and it had some good parts, but overall I would not recommend. It also seemed as if the character was relying on her significant other instead of the Lord for security and strength."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21075082-linda", "userReview": "Words Spoken True by Ann Gabhart is different than the other books I've read from Hollyhill and Rosey Corner.

But I wasn't surprised Stanley was the river slasher, just glad Adriane, Blake, and Beck made it to the end in one piece. Pun not intended :) Her bio doesn't say but Gabhart must have a background in newspapers. This is the second story she has written about a newspaper family. With my husband's connection to newspapers I found this part interesting. But found the title a oxymoron. A couple of the last newspapers printed were versions of the truth rather than the whole truth. Unfortunately, this happens in real life, too.
