No he is not Flex and certainly not Hemp and Serena does not even pretend she is anyone other than who she is. I'll admit, I was disappointed in the beginning and the story started out slow. But we get to know Dave as he decides to head to California to search for his last living relative, Uncle Bug, a self proclaimed prepper/survivalist with an underground bunker and all that goes with it. Serena has already decided to join him but the big surprise is Nelson who insists on joining them. Once again, Dave is not Flex and he has a serious complex constantly questioning himself which gets tedious because he has yet to realize and some readers might forget, Flex and Gem brought Hemp and Charlie into the fold and between them they survived because they were a group who complimented each other as well as helping other people along the way, Dave and his sister included. Dave is going through his own journey following the tradition of not leaving any Zombie alive. Along the way they meet two very important people that will compliment him and Serena by helping him work things out by giving advise, coming up with ideas which only adds to the strength of the small group. As they make their way toward California they meet several groups of people whom they help, sharing some of their weapons and precious supply of Urushiol as well as information that will help humanity survive against the growing threat. Which is exactly what his family(Flex, Gem, Hemp and Charlie as he considers them now) have done and are doing. And yes, Nelson will be the biggest surprise to some and not so much to others as they make their way to California. The pace is slow in some places and goes fast and is tense in others but the biggest surprise will be when they reach California and learn that Uncle Bug is alive and trapped in his mountain Fortress of Solitude. And unless Dave can think of a way to get him out, it could very well be his grave. And no, Uncle Bug is not the BIG surprise... once again Eric Shelman has raised the stakes but is it for the good of humanity or the death of it?"}, {"userName": "Shannon Sharpe", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13756704-shannon-sharpe", "userReview": "Dave's Story....Hand's down my favorite to date! I have read all 5 of the Dead Hunger series and am currently on 6. I wanted to write a special review for this one as I think it may possibly be one of my top favorites in the series. This story is from Dave Gammon's view point and his trip to find his Uncle Bug in hopes that he is still surviving in California. Dave is in hopes that for all the \"prepper\" in his uncle that he may have survived after a year of the ZA.. I originally, like everyone else, probably fell in love with Hemp (the Brains), or even Flex and Gem..Charlie too for that matter. However when I read Dave's \"journal\", I felt such a deeper connection with this character than any of the others. Sure they are ALL great and each one brings a different aspect and freshness to the story, but Dave just really came out on top for me. He is the most down to earth one, swears the least, is unsure and sure at the same time, shows his emotions and above all, this story had me not leaving it until the Kindle actually ran out of charge. All of the stories were great and certainly Mr. Shelman put so much thought and work in to writing all of the story-line, but for some reason the human side and traits and the general story-line in this book struck me as being so much more..I think that he was able to portray and make you feel for Dave in a way that he could be your friend, your neighbor or a family member. He laughed, he cried, he loves, and he is not afraid to show any of those emotions. He is not superhuman and does not have \"badass\" tendencies. He questioned himself many times and that made it a very moving and a realistic approach. I loved the characters brought in and thought each and everyone of them have added such a great part to the stories development. I am SO excited to read more about Isis..Nelson is way cool and am really loving his character development too. All in all I am thrilled Dave got his story! \"It is that awkward moment when you want to say more, but realize you have been rambling already, way too long\"...Great work. :)"}, {"userName": "Lana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12453955-lana", "userReview": "I was a little worried when Dead Hunger V: The Road to California threatened to deviate from our core group that included Flex, Gem, Trina, Hemp and Charlie. I love those characters and really wanted their story to continue. But not to worry, Dead Hunger V takes us back to how the outbreak began for Dave Gammon and he catches us up on his personal story to the point where he leaves Flex and the rest of his adopted family of friends to set out to find out if his Uncle Bug, the only living relative he has left, managed to survive the apocalypse, then takes us along on his journey to California. I liked Dave from the moment he was introduced in Dead Hunger II: The Gem Cardoza Chronicle. Like so many people even in real life, there was so much more depth to him than what his outward appearance suggested. Even though he was a \u201cbiker-type\u201d with long hair and tattoos, he was also soft spoken, sensitive, respectful of everyone (at least the good guys) and even though he doubts his abilities, he turns out to be a very good leader. After reading this fifth chronicle in the series I am even more smitten with Dave. He and Serena, the woman he has come to love, are joined on their journey by the surprise appearance of Nelson Moore, another Dead Hunger character that I\u2019m wild about (he has his own chronicle that I can\u2019t wait to get to in Dead Hunger VIII) and later on meet up with new travel companions. This whole series is amazing, it\u2019s a very unique take on the zombie apocalypse genre and it\u2019s full of action and the signature humor that the author brings to his stories. This is a great addition to the series and just like the others, it takes off from the first pages and doesn\u2019t let up until the end. You\u2019ll be grabbing for Dead Hunger VI to continue the story as soon as you turn the last page."}, {"userName": "Alina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31927139-alina", "userReview": "Where should i start praising this book? I read all five Dead Hunger books in about one month , and i was so slow only because this nasty thing called work interfeered with the reading .I actually finished Dead Hunger V in only 2 days, it is such a thrill, a fast and excithing book, you newer know what will happen next and when the Action is starting you find yourself Holding your breath and keeping your fingers crossed for Dave Gamon, Serena and my new favorite, the stoner Nelson that is actually a Genius in disquise. Nothing is so sexy like a man with a fast working brain, even in the time of Zombies. I am not a newcommer to reading Zombie novels, and especially Zombie series, but i have to declare that i absolutly, 100% think that Eric A.Shelmans books are the best of the genre. The caracthers are great developed, there actions and way of talking is so verry real that you will start thinking about them, about there problems, they will become your friends and a part of your life. Dead Hunger V can be also a road book, because i liked the first part of it allot where our bunch of survivors just tries to find a way to the famous uncle Bug. Wanna know who he is, read the book!Dont make the same mistake that i did, i purchased the first book separate, and only afther it i went for the 5 books box, go for them, hes style is unique, and there are not your average Zombies. Great Humor, great akward Moment jokes, great display of feelings, i like to see how the relationship btw David and Serena evolves, how things start btw the funny Nelson and the cool chopper pilot Rebecca. Love it! I have to confess also that i cant wait to grab the next book and find out what happens next"}, {"userName": "Julie Greig", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31928904-julie-greig", "userReview": "Book V sees a slight departure for our band of survivors.David Gammon has been with our group for a while but has so far played a supporting role.In this instalment he gets his own Chronicle where he decides to leave the relative safety of the group to travel across America to find his prepper Uncle Bug.Eric has managed once again to add a twist to keep the journey not only inviting to the reader but fresh and sharp with this path.My 'promoting' a supporting character to the front of the stage allows a new slant, that is the skill of the writer being able to continue with a leading thread but changing the tension ever so slightly with a new character.He, Dave, has his own style and it shows through in this book. We get to find out what makes him tic, his deeper thoughts, wants and loves - he becomes a hero in his own right.Yet another 'can't put it down page turner'Pausing before Book VI only long enough to write this!"}, {"userName": "Thomas Jr.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33188782-thomas-jr", "userReview": "I wasn't quite sure if Dave really was going to be able to hold his own book. It was different not having, Flex, Gem and Hemp and the rest of the crew around as the main focus of the book. I think Mr. Shelman did a fantastic job of putting this book together and fleshing out Dave, Serena and Nelson and adding some new characters to the fray.It was a little slow going to start with, but once it got moving I couldn't put it down. The fact that he's able to keep things interesting with so many different characters and actually make you route for them and get attached is something very special. So often I find books and series with such a large cast gets lost in its own size. This is clearly not the case with the Dead Hunger series. Loved the developments and to be honest I think Nelson has become one of my favorite characters in the series. Can't wait to get going on the next book. Keep up the fantastic work on this marvelous series."}, {"userName": "R Martine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34351519-r-martine", "userReview": "As much as I adore Gem, Flex, Hemp and Charlie, I also adore Dave and Serena. They seem to be a perfect match and Dave's fierceness to complete his self made promise and fulfill a wish of Lisa's is not something he is prepared to ignore. He and Serena set off and start the journey with a surprise guest that keeps things quite interesting. The road to Cali isn't an easy one, but none of them expected the end to be quite what it is.... Now the only question you should be asking is, Is this one as good as the others?? HECK YES!!!!

I have latched on to the characters, immersed myself in the whole concepts of the books. I loved the Road to California, and getting to know Dave and Serena better!!My only criticism of the book as that it seemed to segue way to quickly during Dave's story of losing his sister.
