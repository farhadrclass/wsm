But that would make Fire look cruel to dump Archer when he's openly sleeping with every other girl in the country so we're going to have to kill him off. This is wartime, we could do it there (although it'd be more likely that he dies from an STD), no, there's that whole unanswered question about king Leck in the prologue (the only good part of the story) so there's got to be a showdown with Fire and Leck and maybe all of Archer's testosterone can get him in trouble there.

The core of my issues with it remains the same, specifically Cashore's nontraditional approach to marriage and women's empowerment. I'll elaborate on it later. But besides that, this time this book is just boring. I think I was pretty generous to give Fire 3.5 stars 2 years ago. I now feel it deserves at least 1 star less. Too much navel-gazing, too much contemplating and whining and crying on Fire's part without enough action and romance to balance things out, too much talk of periods and cramps. Plus, the nature of Fire's power is such that even the most climactic part of the novel comes off as an over-complicated non-event.I still think there is an improvement in Cashore's writing in terms of world-building. But, after reading Megan Whalen Turner's novels that were, undoubtedly, an inspiration to Cashore, Fire pales in comparison. The intrigues, the politics of it are only weak shadows of those of Attolia.And now onto the main concerns. I think it's certainly brave of an author to create novels where heroines are different from the so-called norm. Cashore writes young women craving full independence, undesiring of long-term partners and children. That's fine. But I can't help but be disappointed in how all women are portrayed in Fire. They all are not exactly immoral, but definitely lacking in scruples, dignity and caution. They cheat, the sleep with everyone around, they get pregnant when they have resources not to, they don't care if they are cheated on, they, to me, seem to think they don't deserve love, monogamy or at least respect. The men are no better, they are indiscriminately cheaters, philanderers and rapists. I'll be hard-pressed to find even one healthy, committed relationship between a man and a woman in this book, a relationship where participants are equal partners in all decisions, including those concerning procreation. Call me old-fashioned, but I believe a man should have a say in the decisions about child-bearing as well. As a result, Fire is full to the brim with illegitimate children (literally, almost everyone in the book is a bastard or a result of a rape) and excessive amount of casual, adulterous and forced sex. It's a soap opera!And it's boring and would have benefited from some tightening up.I don't think I'll be reading Fire again."}, {"userName": "Tamora Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1451591-tamora-pierce", "userReview": "Fire is a monster. Monsters in her homeland are creatures of brilliant colors, each with abilities, that feed on humans and animals (there are even monster insects!) and each other. They have a tremendous attraction for human beings, one of extreme passion which leads to murder, clutching, or attack, depending on the human, which is why Fire has led much of her life isolated in the house of her hated monster father, who died several years ago. Her only friends are Archer and his father.And then everything goes pear-shaped. A strange bowman with an empty head shoots Archer. Fire brings him in, but he escapes, and is murdered in turn. The realm is in chaos, and the crown is calling on Fire to use her mind-probing skills to find out what spies are withholding. Fire doesn't want to do it--she feels she must live her life in expiation for her father's existence and her own--but she must go to the capital to face the issue herself. It's an incredibly complex book. Fire is in the position of holding off one brother who is driven to possessive passion by her monster looks, while another brother distrusts her and she cannot tell what the third thinks of her at all. She's in an ethical tangle over entering the minds of others, but she has to do it to survive, or people would tear her to pieces. She has her own dark secrets, for someone who has lived in the country all her life. And her best friend, the only one who wants nothing from her, is a horse named Small.Cashore's writing is more polished than GRACELING, and Fire is a very different person from Katsa.

So, I was thinking Archer was going to be my love interest in the book until. . . 1. He's all in Fire's business when she talks to any of the guards. 2. He's always harassing her to marry him. 3. He tells Fire he will quit sleeping around if she would just marry him. DUDE! I WOULD DROP-KICK YOU OFF THE ROOF! And Fire too for that matter for still sleeping with him! But, I digress. It took me a minute to like Brigan. He was a jerk a bit at first but for good reasons. Then he started to fall in love with Fire and she with him. I was hoping there was going to be a big ole wedding but there wasn't unless I missed it while stomping on people and drop-kicking people of roofs. <--- that was a big ole run on sentence Brigan had a sweet little girl named Hanna that I loved too. Fire met Brigan and King Nash and other peeps when she journeyed from her home with Archer to meet everyone and do some stuff. Fire lived in her own house and Archer and his father, Lord Brocker in the other house. They protected each other. Anyway, all kinds of things went down and war is brewing and spies everywhere trying to kill everyone. Fire can read minds and change peoples minds or destroy them if she wants. She's part monster. <--- Heh! I'm not even explaining all of that, you can read the book. This does make men fall at her feet with desire and rape on their minds! I mean, really? She is also attacked by other monster animals because they desire her blood. Thus, we get to read continually in the book about her damn time of the month and how they had to kill extra raptor monsters to keep her safe. I have never heard about a woman's period so much in my life! I did like Fire though even with the few faults she had and I loved her horse, Small. He was a great horse and friend to her. So there was a lot of people coming and going and fighting and some evil peeps killed someone that I didn't want to die even if they made me mad. There were several attempts on Fire's life. Overall I liked the book and some of the characters. I did love Fire's guards, Musa and Mila. They were good women guards that ended up as friends too. There were a few other people I liked too.

Fire never gripped me, I never came to care about her, or even like her much.There are a lot of things about this book that bothered me. The character of Archer, the friend with benefits, seems out of place in a YA novel. There was an awful lot of casual sex and making babies and confused parentage.And, seriously, she has to walk around with an armed guard because she's having her period? All of that info went nowhere, it didn't add to the story and wasn't neccessary to the plot. Fire's relationship with Brigan didn't ring true. It didn't have anything to base it on other than he was kind to her and she couldn't get in his head. Where have I read that before?I didn't quite understand the whole monster world. Where did they come from? There wasn't any real tension to the book, nothing she was striving toward or away from, it all just sort of sits there, nothing really memorable about the whole story.

Where do I begin?Perhaps I should begin with my rating. One star seems harsh, truly, but goodreads describes that rating as, \"Didn't like it.\" And that is an accurate description, for I simply didn't like the book. Thus I'm sticking with one star. And now for the book itself: I was hyped for the day I would actually get my hands on it and presumably storm through the whole thing in six hours, as I had done with Graceling. This anticipation was fueled by the raving reviews (on goodreads and elsewhere) which called it EVEN BETTER than it's companion, DIFFERENT, BETTER WRITTEN, STUNNING, BOUND TO \"WOW\" YOU - Well, all I can do is wonder if others had read this book with their eyes closed. Please, all ye who read this rant and disagree with me, don't think of me as being accusatory; it's just that, plowing my way through the book, that was one of the thoughts which ammounted to my overall disbelief. Different? Fire is a mirror image of Graceling. Same plot. Same characters. Same nuances. Except, it seems, it is Graceling with the good sucked out of it. Katsa, in the first book, was spirited and interesting. (With her temper, she reminds me somewhat of Thirrin of the Icemark - possibly the best, strongest, and most genuine female protagonist I have come to encounter. Kudos, Mr. Hill, for everything.)But Katsa did have some sort of ridiculous internal battles along the way, which I placently accepted, so long as there were heads to bash and throats to slit and all that general badassery was involved. Take away the ability to kill ten men with a toothpick in under thirty seconds, and you have Fire. Brigan was a sort of mofified version of Po, Archer was Giddon, and so on and so forth. (Leck, incidentally, was completely unnecessary. So he gave us a prologue and killed some people. Great.) It mollifies me at the amount of connections I can make between the two books, and this shows me that Cashore is limited in her ability to weave characters, because eventually they all start reflecting one another.I had expected for Fire, the most imporant persona in the book, to be a sort of Katsa, if not having immense strength in body, then in spirit.SHE. IS. NOT. A. STRONG. LEAD. Even if she were not a lead, she would still be a completely useless and annoying brat. She whines, she mopes. She cries. (Not that crying is a bad thing, but she cries for absolutely no purpose.) She seems to hardly do anything herself, and constantly rely on other characters to help her. She has no pride, she allows herself to be waited on by a team of armored bodyguards, and cannot survive alone - such a pity, because that was what made Katsa so admirable. Perhaps Cashore intended them to be different, simply by making Fire weak? But she is not. Where did the author intend Fire to go, whom was she trying to impact?And Cashore had tried to impact her readers, I really think she tried. Throughout Fire's epiphanies (usually after she ends up storming out on some character on another - she does that a lot), Cashore tries to send across messages. But the thing is, a) they're so naive that it's not worth the trouble, Cashore, or b) they never get to the reader at all, because Fire is a sort of pitfall in the many heroines of literature. What was I supposed to have learned, that one shouldn't be ashamed of one's parentage? That it really can't be helped that society will see a person as someone else, no matter how different their heart and intentions are? \"Be yourself\" - is that what is put across here? Fire discovers that she can use her nature for good in the end, she really can! Well, jolly good for her. Fire can't get over death; she can't get over truth. By the end I was screaming, GET UP, WOMAN. GET A GRIP. AND GO SAVE THE WORLD. Really, I was so desperate to see her take control for once and ride out to meet the looming army with a battle standard in hand, the dawn glinting on her silver helm. I was that much saddened. But moral lessons aside, I was extremely irritated - make it vexed, by some point - about some of the technicalities. The sex lives of all the different characters accounted for, oh, let's say, half the plot. Most of the book was spent running around discovering who slept with whom, who sired whom, and who killed their respective fathers and how. I mean, come on, the whole \"I am your father,\" \"REALLY?!\" thing has gotten so old, and Cashore drops that bombshell a few times in the book. Incidentally, yes, Cashore, Fire's great secret I figured out ten chapters before you finally gave it away. It ran like a great big midday TV soap opera. There was too much sleeping around, too much desire to sleep around, and inability to stop oneself from sleeping around. Also in the realm of irritating lay Fire and her seriously annoying menstrual necessities, the whole impregnation and contraception aspect, and too much talk of having children, not having children, and being pregnant. Countless times I had smacked the book against my forehead, howling WHY IS THIS NECESSARY TO THE PROGRESSION OF THE PLOT? Beneath all these different feels lurks a sort of hideous impression about what Cashore may have implied in this book. She asks, somewhere towards the middle, \"What is the point of a woman monster?\" and it seems to me she answers it. If she truly believes something like that, then I should like to take the book itself and smack someone with it, preferrably her. Of course, I could be completely wrong, so I'll keep this suspicion to myself. But it seemed to me as though the book, which was supposed to be feminist, went way, way, way in the other direction. The writing, by the way, was not that good. Not much description, and not much unique brilliance. It does not shine. An exception I made for the fiery persona in Graceling, but here it only underlines the Fire's flaws.

I think it's because I sort of feel like other authors are my coworkers, all of us working and writing to make people fall in love with reading, so who am I to publicly say what is or isn't right? But I can't help myself in this case. I feel rather as though I fell as inexplicably and inextricably under this book's spell as its characters fall under Fire's. I had no chance against its beauty! And now I have to shout my love from the rooftops.To be honest, for the first few chapters I rolled my eyes every five minutes, because seriously, who gets away with writing about a heroine who is objectively the most beautiful woman in the world, one of a kind, loved and desired by everyone who meets her, blessed with fiery red hair and gifts for music and archery and horseback riding, and--to top it off--able to control the thoughts and feelings of those around her?

Not as good as Graceling, but interesting enough. Probably a 2 1/2 star effort. I had originally given it three, but was so worked up by the time I was done typing the rant below that I had to change it (please consider that when looking at the rating). Will probably appeal just fine to the same crowd that liked Graceling - unless they become bothered by the same things I am. And good Lord, was I bothered. Considering how excited most people seem to be by this book my difficulties with the book are probably largely personal.I've got a lot of beefs with this book. I'm not sure exactly what my expectations were for this one anymore, but this book definitely didn't meet them. And there were a number of problems, described below in no particular order.First of all: There are WAY too many similarities to be found to Graceling in terms of characterization. Both books feature fairly obnoxious female main characters who a) possess some sort of strange supernatural gift that they really don't want and that stigmatizes them from the rest of society, b) are completely absorbed in thier own problems, c) have refused to marry, and d) have an incredibly convenient connection to the local royal family that they aren't particularly proud of. The difference is that in Graceling, Katsa was fiesty and interesting. Fire, while somewhat interesting (if you like soap operas, see below) just agrivated me. Both books also feature really excellent male romantic interests who are way more engaging from start to finish than the main character and who also happen to be youngest princes who have great fighting skill but no interest in ruling. It really bothers me that when it comes down to it, the two central characters of both books are just variants of each other. Doesn't show a lot of growth at all on Cashore's part.Speaking of not-so-stellar writing, allow me to complain about Fire's structure. Just as in Graceling, this book takes about 200+ pages to introduce all of the major players and their back stories. Then we break into the main plot. When we finally get to the war that we've been building up to for the first 300+ pages (well, actually just the middle 100 pages since the first 200 were all stupid introduction) it's hardly touched on at all except as a tool for Fire to a) figure out that she really does love Brigan and b) be incredibly, obnoxiously whiny about how awful war is. In Fire, many of the chapters follow a certain pattern: a) Fire recalls some memory of her awful father, which b) somehow relates to something else happening to her in the present, which often leads to, c) a starteling revelation. While not a bad formula to use, it gets old after a few hundred pages.But back to obnoxious similarities between Fire and Graceling. Despite the ages of the main characters in both books, they aren't really teens. They're adults in their teen years. This didn't bother me so much in Graceling when I first read it, but it's so painful in Fire. Both Katsa and Fire are WAY too knowledgable about the world around them and they're making such adult decisions with such maturity and it never once seems out of place for the setting. Well, at least until the book's final 150 pages or so, when plenty of splendid melodramatic angsty scenes appear in which Fire whines about how awful the world is and then learns her lesson by talking to and/or observing another (more adult!) character who of course knows better. While reading Fire, I wondered if it wasn't for Graceling, if Fire would have been marketed as an adult book - with teen appeal for sure, but its tone and characterization have a much more \"adult book\" feel.My biggest problem with this book, and a big part of the reason why I feel it was so adult: I was incredibly bothered by the way that sex was handled in Fire. ALL of the sexual power was given to men and women were their toys who apparently can't say no 9 out of 10 times when a man wants them. It angered to no end that Fire was so victimized because \"oh, poor me, I'm so beautiful that men fall all over themselves for me, which I hate, but I'm just a woman so what even can I do about it? It would be different if I was a man...\" - over and over and over again. It got old. Just like Katsa and Po, Fire and Archer became lovers the moment their relationship turned romantic. Ditto for Fire and Brigan. Archer did nothing but piss me off with his womanizing, and it angered me to no end that Fire knew about it while she was still sleeping with him, and put up with it. Even Clara, the spymaster-princess and easily the strongest female character in the book, falls for that stupid man's spell and ends up knocked up. Lord. I'm also incredibly peeved that while Fire is 17, every man she sleeps with is a good five years older than her - and they're easily among the youngest of the adult characters. I realize that this is fantasy and such age differences and the maturity level of certain 17-year-old characters is typical of traditional fantasy, but it drives me nuts.My final rant: The book is a total soap opera. Really, the plot is driven more by characters than by plot, and even then not so much by character growth. It's more about who's really who's father than anything else. Entertaining enough I guess, and probably one of the only reasons I kept reading after 200 pages, but not the tone I wanted after so much immediate action in Graceling.So yeah...the book's fine if you like soap operas, where pretty much each of my other beefs with this book would be acceptable. A huge disappointment for me though. And it made me dislike Graceling more because of all of the stupid similarities that taint my memories of the first book.

I should have known that it would exceed my expectations and then some, quite possibly trumping its predecessor.Fire is the last remaining human monster living in a war torn kingdom called the Dells. Once filled with beauty and wealth, the Dells have fallen into ruin by the hands of her monster father, Cansrel and his human conduit, King Nax. Though both have been dead for several years, the kingdom remains in a vulnerable state, as neighboring kings are attempting to conquer the lands and steal the crown from young King Nash and his commander brother, Brigan.As a monster, Fire has the ability to read and control minds; however, due to her fear of becoming the monster her father was, she has spent years denying her power and has attempted to disguise who she is to protect both herself and those around her. When Fire is attacked by a mindless poacher, Fire travels to Queen Roen in search of answers and aid, but a fateful meeting puts her in the direct path of the very two people she has tried her best to avoid, Nash and Brigan. Knowing all the power Fire posses and the potential that power could have in saving his kingdom, Nash calls on her to use her power for the greater good. But when does power become destructive? And who can tell when the lines have become blurred? What follows is a beautiful story about embracing who you are and conquering your fears.I found Fire\u2019s world to be well drawn, expertly woven and colorfully written. Each character is a delicious shade of gray, possessing both light and dark tendencies; much like we do in life and Cashore does a remarkable job of creating a realistic royal family in a fantastical setting.

Cashore\u2019s books have always succeeded primarily because of their character work and introspection, not their plotting, but this book\u2019s plot is so flimsy compared to the other two that I can\u2019t forgive it. Fire is set in the Dells, a land beyond the borders of the Seven Kingdoms. The Dells have no gracelings, but plenty of colorful monsters. Fire is the last remaining human monster, renowned for beauty; she lives in fear of both others and of herself. Cashore\u2019s worldbuilding is incredible, with complex politics and an interesting narrative around discrimination and sexism. The political drama here, unfortunately, gets a bit boring in places. Fire\u2019s character is undoubtedly the strength of this novel. She\u2019s more mentally strong and fierce in her convictions, rather than physically strong as Katsa was. She\u2019s just as wonderfully complex as the other two heroines. Unfortunately, I personally didn\u2019t connect with her nearly as much as I did with Katsa and Bitterblue. Considering the strong impact of character work on Cashore\u2019s books, my lack of connection to Fire really hampered my enjoyment of this book. That being said, I still absolutely think Fire is worth reading. All three of these books are worthy favorites; it just depends which heroine you happen to like best. And therein lies the brilliance of Cashore\u2019s writing. This entire series is brilliant and gets a high recommendation from me."}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8472395-alyssa", "userReview": "Update (August 2017): Oh y'all.

The main narrative starring Fire (a half-human/half-monster young woman) is framed by the story of a particular young Graceling who has the ability to control others completely... you'll recognize the future King Leck immediately. Fire has a similar talent, but because of her monster blood she can actually sense what people are thinking rather than simply order them around. Her distinctive monster hair is all colors of red and orange, mesmerizing and enraging people in turns in this strange land so near and yet so far removed from the kingdoms we grew to know so well in Graceling. Fire's story is wrapped around her changing relationship with childhood friend (now lover) Archer and an impending war in which she must navigate various intrigues, and, eventually, face Leck again. This book has a LOT more romance/violence/shades of sexuality than I remembered in Graceling. Plenty of interpersonal drama will make this especially appealing to readers who might not otherwise crave high fantasy. Just as Graceling drew fans of Tamora Pierce and her strong female characters, Fire will definitely do the same. Cashore is wonderful at world-building and shows off her talents to best advantage in this follow-up which will be one of the most-requested books of 2009."}, {"userName": "Dannii Elle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle", "userReview": "I adore it when writers have so fully fleshed out their fantastical worlds that they are able to build a novel around an entire previously unseen section in an entirely new era!This is the second installment in the Graceling series and, set a few decades before the events that occur in Graceling and sharing only one of the same characters, can almost be read as a standalone novel.Upon finishing Graceling I immediately begun this with less than an hour's break in between and was initially disappointed. I had formed a bond with the first set of characters and had misplaced expectations that I would be spending the entirety of the three books of this trilogy in their company. These feelings soon dissipated, however, as I realized that this new cast was just as lovable. The world Fire inhabits is geographically close to Katsa's, their feisty feminist attitudes are very much aligned and so are their positions in society. But that is where the similarities stop.Fire's world is a far more dangerous and feral place to live, with monster animals haunting her every move and a society of people who distrust and despise her status as the last living human monster.The particulars of what exactly a monster is, is never fully explained, however. And this seemed to be a running theme of the book. I dually loved every moment of reading it and felt a step behind the plot the entire time. Perhaps it was the abundance of characters or that I was still partially still caught up in the previous plot, but I continually seemed to be slightly slow in grasping the particulars of the narrative. I think it says something about the power of the book, as a whole, and the beauty of the writing that I can still give it four stars after stating that.Overall, this is a powerfully written and action-dominated book, with a set of lovable and authentic characters, set in a flawlessly created, vast and varied world that I can't seem to get enough of!"}, {"userName": "Steph Su", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2010935-steph-su", "userReview": "When an author's second novel far surpasses her already critically acclaimed debut novel, you know there\u2019s something special going on. Kristin Cashore is such an author, and FIRE is such a book. Not since Robin McKinley has an author written so convincingly of a politically charged fantasy world.The protagonist, Fire, has the cursed gift of absolute beauty and attractiveness, and many times during the course of the book, she brings up the question, \u201cHow does gender factor into the reaction to beauty?\u201d For Fire constantly encounters men who want to do unspeakable things to her at the very sight of her, while her equally attractive father had people falling at his feet, eager to do his bidding. Call it fantasy for sure, but FIRE contains a lot of gender politics that could make for interesting discussions, even in the classroom.Kristin Cashore deftly unfolds Fire\u2019s past into her present story, which helps readers slowly understand and appreciate her judgments. Even so, FIRE is an intensely emotional read, especially at the end. Its ability to affect me so strongly is one of the things I like best about it, though. The romance between Fire and Brigan is less developed than the one between Katsa and Po in GRACELING, but Kristin gives depth to all the characters, not simply the protagonist and her love interest, and I\u2019d much rather have three-dimensionality in all my characters than in just the two main ones.It\u2019s difficult to say this for sure right now, but if you had to read only one hard fantasy YA book this year, FIRE just might be the one.

Most monsters are animals, with exceptional qualities like silver fur or iridescent wings (raptors are a big one in this story). Fire's is her bright red hair, that she usually keeps under wraps to avoid the gazes of other monsters, as well as other humans who are exceptionally hateful towards people like her.This book takes place in The Dells, which is separated from the seven kingdoms (from the first book) by a mountain range. Neither kingdom seems to know that the other exists. So this book I think is equally as good as the first. Although it is SO HARD to beat the Katsa/Po relationship, I think Fire's relationship with Brigan is so perfect, evolves from dislike to love which I like (not that I totally dislike insta-love) Her relationship with his daughter (Hanna) is so adorable, I can't even control the feels. Her backstory is fantastic, especially what you learn about her relationship she had with her father (Lord Cansrel, when he was alive). He was really crazy and kind of cruel and it helps you understand why she doesn't take advantage of people with her gift. You briefly come across Leck in this book. There were men from the beginning of the book who kept appearing who seemed to have \"empty minds\" and Fire thinks it is Leck causing it. She gets into an altercation with him (He's a boy at the time) and he falls into a mountain and we don't see him again. \"It's not reasonable to love people who are only going to die,\" she said.Nash thought about that for a moment, stroking Small's neck with great deliberation, as if the fate of the Dells depended on that smooth, careful movement.\"I have two responses to that,\" He said at last. \"First, everyone is going to die. Second, love is stupid. It has nothing to do with reason. You love whomever you love. Against all reason I loved my father.\" He looked at her keenly. \"Did you love yours?\"\"Yes,\" she whispered.He stroked Small's nose. \"I love you,\" he said, \"even knowing you'll never have me. And I love my brother, more than I ever realized before you came along. You can't help whom you love, Lady. Nor can you know what it's liable to cause you to do.\" \u2014 Kristin Cashore (Fire (Graceling Realm, #2))"}, {"userName": "Grace \u1d54\u1d25\u1d54", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14145599-grace", "userReview": "You can find my review of Fire on my blog too!This was\u00a0the most gorgeous romantic fantasy I\u2019ve read in a while. And want to know what the last one was? \u2014\u00a0Graceling!! Kristin Cashore is just so good at writing these beautiful, deep relationships that stem from trust and acceptance.It\u2019s been 24 hours since I\u2019ve read this book and I just. can\u2019t. stop. thinking about it! How much these two characters cared for each other makes me so happy.No insta-love here, folks. Just a beautifully slow progression from less than friends to lovers.Fire\u00a0takes place many years before the events of\u00a0Graceling, and involves all new characters except for one.\u00a0Fire\u00a0lives in the Dells, a place so divided from the Seven Kingdoms that they don\u2019t even know each other exist.Within the Dells there are monsters \u2014 animals with bizarre, unnatural colorings: bright blue kittens, orange raptors, purple mountain lions. There are even monster humans \u2014 and Fire is one of them, and the last of her kind.Fire has fiery red hair and intangible beauty that makes any onlooker go mad. She also possesses the rare ability to control minds, an ability that could be very useful to her kingdom as it is on the verge of war.That\u2019s when Prince Brigan  arrives, asking Fire to come to King\u2019s City to use her powers to undercover the plans of enemies and traitors. But Fire fears becoming the monster her father was, and she may let her doubts get in the way of everything \u2014 even true love.The romance aspect of the plot is significant, but progresses slowly and organically. The other side of the plot is the\u00a0impending war. There\u2019s lots of talking about the armies, enemies, attacks, traitors, planning and plotting, etc.If you find a war setting boring, you may not enjoy this book\u00a0because it is a large portion of the plot.\u00a0What I love about this series is that Kristin Cashore always incorporates powerful women/feminist themes into these fantastical stories. In a \u201cwar\u201d setting one would expect to see mostly men, especially in this medieval time period. But in the Dells, woman are in the army, and some are even ranked very highly. It was refreshing to see some strong female characters in not so typical settings.Additionally, Kristin Cashore is one of the few YA authors who actually mentioned a woman getting her period. I know a lot of people thought the multiple mentions of this was redundant in the book, but I just appreciated it was mentioned in general.I know some people have an issue with how the women act in this book \u2014 have sex with multiple men, get pregnant, cheat with or on, etc \u2014 and they say Kristin Cashore is spreading the message that these types of behaviors are \u201cokay\u201d. For me, I didn\u2019t really see it that way. I think that this is simply just a different world, a different time period \u2014 people act differently, have different viewpoints on marriage and casual sex, etc.\u00a0But if these aspects are ones that you\u2019d be upset by, I would recommend not reading this book because they come up quite a bit. There are also mentions of acts of rape, but no graphic scenes.As for the characters, I really loved them, even the less significant ones. The main protagonists are so strong and multi-layered, I loved learning about their life and watching them overcome difficult points of their life. Fire shows a lot of strength and will power throughout the book, and her love interest was endlessly charming, considerate, and understanding \u2014 I loved them both so much.Overall, I was worried about not liking this book because it was all new characters, but I absolutely loved it \u2014 equally as much as\u00a0Graceling!\u00a0I love romance in fantasy and this was just done so perfectly. I also loved this new world full of monsters and beauty, and the many side characters we met along the way. Although I don\u2019t usually like war settings in books, I liked this one because it wasn\u2019t too heavy and overly detailed, and was mixed in well among the romance. Overall, I\u2019m loving the\u00a0Graceling Realm\u00a0so far!

She simplifies the telling and complexifies heroine. In Graceling, she tells the story of a badass warrior woman, a survivor, an Ellen Ripley. In Fire, she tells the story of a beautiful trophy girlfriend, an aspiring homemaker, a super model who loves babies, a monster combination of Joan Harris and vampire Bella Swan. Our girl, Fire, is from a race of what the story cleverly calls \u201cmonsters,\u201d and I like that both Fire and her society adopt that word as accurate. Her body is exactly what I would think of as a monster. I approve.Briefly, for if you don't already know, in this story, our people live in a land where monsters are these sort of magical predators who crave blood and flesh, but are so beautiful and colorful that they mesmerize normal humans and animals just by their looks. They have mind-control powers, and when they are in human form, the mind control powers are stronger because, you know, humans are brainy. Fire got her name because she is a ginger, but a monster ginger, so her hair looks like fire, and she has to wrap it up because when dudes see it, they basically try to rape her and when animals monsters see it, they try to eat her. Hair is such a problem.Now I am going to talk about my ruminations on the conflict between what our bodies are and what our essences, or souls, or whatever, are. Sometimes, I sit around and think about how disconnected I feel as a person from the way my body looks, regardless of the specifics of how I look at that particular moment \u2013 fat or thin; white, red, brown, black, or purple hair; strong or weak. Or maybe I feel disconnected from the way people react to my body; it is difficult to say for sure. It makes me think that before we are born, we are floating in the sky as some kind of disembodied essence, and we choose our bodies through a series of escalating dares. I wonder what made me choose this one.Say, before you were born, your essence had these cards laid out on the poker table of body choices: you could be a gorgeous black woman in the 1950s in the South; the youngest, scrawniest brother in a family full of white coal miners; a rich, white sorority girl; or the son of the first Korean-American President of the United States. You know, say, that you, your essence, is a light, delicate thing, something that hates conflict and loves hot cocoa and hearth fires. Do you go with the safe bet or give yourself a challenge? Does that obnoxious other soul in the corner antagonize you into choosing the black woman in the 1950s just because it doesn\u2019t think you could take it? Or do you go with the possibly safer, but more depressing, sorority girl? Could your delicacy and conflict-aversion handle living inside a man\u2019s body in a society that shames delicate men?Whatever you decide, you\u2019re all, \u201cCHALLENGE ACCEPTED!\u201d and you fly off into the horrors and joys of the body you chose. But, the rules are that once you\u2019re there, you can\u2019t remember how you got there in the first place. You have to fight that battle blind because otherwise the battle isn\u2019t testing your instincts and you\u2019re not as invested in the game.Or maybe there\u2019s some bureaucrat in the sky with a giant spreadsheet. I don\u2019t know.Fire made me think about who we are in essence and the way our bodies shape us because I think Cashore articulately describes the powerlessness of beauty and how, while we might aspire to that, it might not be something we really want. Fire's horrifying monster beauty and her horrifying X-Woman skill of mind control, and the shame she felt over those parts of herself were interesting. On the one hand, there is a little bit of a poor-little-rich-girl about the story that I think Graceling also had to some extent, but it doesn\u2019t really dwell in it. There\u2019s so much straight action and Fire is so heroic that it only nudges against the border of maudlin. I don\u2019t think it really crosses over, or at least not often. But, I think that it illustrates how having a body, whether it is the body of a monster or not, is hard. Dealing with social reactions to a body is hard. But, it is worth it.I think girls often have a sort of out-of-body experience of someone assuming a lot about our personalities from our appearances. Probably men experience that, too, though I wonder how similar the experiences are. I have dimples, so people often don\u2019t expect me to be as much of an asshole as I am and feel extra betrayed by my bitchiness. Fire is kind of like that, too, in that her personality is not what the stories told people to expect from that body. Regardless of what the false expectation is, because it is probably different for us all, there is still that sense of being out of place in a body. I think it is an identifiable female sentiment, and maybe identifiable because there is so much media propaganda about female bodies being wrong. But, at the same time, I have this instinctual sense that I am lucky to have a body at all, and that I should take care of it, and I get the feeling that most people have at least a sliver of that same instinct.Anyway, I found this beautiful. I liked these people and animals. I liked Fire and I also liked the use of fire as imagery and its association with mourning and cleansing. At times, I found the light use of somewhat courtly language awkward, but that\u2019s not a big deal when action is going down. I\u2019m bumping this up to a five-star rating because I think it is ballsy to write a sequel that is only loosely connected to the first, and I thought that was a well-executed ballsy move. Addressing the stereotype of a beautiful, affectionate woman was smart after having told the story of a survivor in the first book.I want to be Kristin Cashore\u2019s friend.

The Dells do not have Gracelings, but they do have \u201cmonsters.\u201d Monsters are brightly colored and extremely beautiful versions of their normal counterparts. They have mental abilities that allow them to communicate with and control non-monsters. ( Think bright green mice, pale blue spotted leopards, and beautiful florescent birds.)Fire is the last remaining human monster. She has flaming pink, red, orange, and gold hair and a face of unparalleled beauty. She lives in the north of the Dells with Archer (her best friend and sometimes lover) and the rest of her adoptive family. Her existence is simple. She teaches music, hunts with Archer, and does her best to stay alive. Fire is hunted by other monsters that would love to eat her and is persecuted by humans who do not understand her.War is brewing within the Dells. King Nash and his brother, Prince Brigan, are training their army to fight off their encroaching neighbors. Nash recognizes that Fire\u2019s mental capabilities would be an asset to the army and could tip the balance in their favor. Fire reluctantly agrees. Fire becomes an interrogator for the King and helps Nash and Brigan plot to put down the usurpers. Fire\u2019s very appearance provokes strong emotion. In some it\u2019s hatred and others it\u2019s infatuation. Brigan is completely closed off to her at first, but he is controlled and not unfeeling. Respect and not infatuation change their relationship into something more. They naturally evolve as enemies become allies, as allies become friends, and as friends become lovers. There\u2019s a lot I\u2019m not telling, because I cannot summarize this book into a decent length. There\u2019s just too much plot, world building, and character development. It\u2019s just too rich to condense properly. I am a huge Graceling fan so there was no question that I\u2019d love Fire. And I do love it as much as Graceling. I love seeing the similarities in worlds and writing, but the difference between the 7 Kingdoms & the Dells is fascinating. There are themes in Fire that are reminiscent of Graceling \u2013 independence, open-mindedness, & freedom. Fire is nothing like Katsa, but she lives by the same standards as Katsa did and Brigan lives by the same standards as Po. That\u2019s what reminds me that they\u2019re in the same world, because if it weren\u2019t for that (and the appearance of Leck - evil jerk) I\u2019d never know it. It\u2019s different, but not different. You should read it and see.The plot is intricate from beginning to end. Cashore has an excellent way of dragging out the falling climax to tie everything together. She masterfully loops the plot back around to have a very satisfactory resolution. She also knows how to open with the action and the exposition is gradually worked into the rising action in an unobtrusive way. The writing is just damn good.There is so much right with Fire it\u2019s hard to pick out what\u2019s wrong. If I had to pick out one thing (which I hate doing, but I always do, so I will here) is that the plot seems to have social/political agenda relevant to this day and age. It was also in Graceling, but less obvious. Maybe it\u2019s more obvious in Fire because I was looking for it. I don\u2019t mind, because I totally back her agenda, but I think it will put off some readers. Also, there is a lot of violence towards animals and monster animals. Fire is in no way a happy-feely book, so be prepared. In conclusion, I loved it. 5 stars. It might not be for everyone, but it\u2019s definitely for me. Bring on the feminist fantasy YA!PS - For a man\u2019s perspective my husband is currently reading Fire. When he gives his opinion I\u2019ll let you know. UPDATE 5/11/09 - Chris thinks that Fire has the same \"formula\" as Graceling and those who enjoyed something ground breaking in Graceling will feel as if it's more of the same in Fire.

Yes, there are regular mice, cats and humans as well but why the monster mice haven't done away with the regular mice by now is beyond me.Fire lives a quiet, hum-drum life until an archer is caught on her property after he nearly kills her. She spends the next 100 pages getting hurt by various animals and people, and I began to worry that Fire was going to be a damsel in distress. Thankfully, that is not the case and things begin to pick up once her injuries have healed. Unfortunately, it goes downhill again when she travels to the kings palace. The king, of course, is bowled over by her beauty and can't control himself around her while his brother, Brigan, stays away from her at all cost because she has the power to control people's thoughts. Fire, feels like a prisoner because her beauty puts her in constant peril of men and monster-raptors who smell her out particularly when she is having her period. Yes, that's just what I said.There is basically no plot except that the kingdom is under threat of being attacked by upstarts. Brigan is always coming and going, spying to gather information for the king. It seems unlikely, therefore, that Fire will begin a romance with Brigan, but that is just what happens. There is no climax, however, and this story just seems to putter along.The story picks up its pace when the Graceling character appears, but his quick exit deflates the story once more. The ending was uneventful and you are left wondering what kind of future is in store for Fire and Brigan. The supporting characters' storylines seem to get more of a wrap-up than Fire. I give this book 2 and a half stars because though Cashore did have some interesting ideas, it seemed to lack clear direction."}], "description": "It is not a peaceful time in the Dells.
