Tom Swan keeps getting better and better... superb dialogue, complex plots, and many colorful details will delight the reader. I found the unexpected twists of fate to be masterful. I can't wait to read the next installment!"}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12820034-robert", "userReview": "More!Not much action but plenty of intrigue, as Tom Swan goes to work for the Pope, and much is learned about late mediaeval banking. The Riccardo of Lucca should have been so lucky. A suspenseful ending has me inpatient for the next installment."}], "description": "Fifteenth-century Europe. Tom Swan is not a professional soldier. He's really a merchant and a scholar looking for remnants of Ancient Greece and Rome - temples, graves, pottery, fabulous animals, unicorn horns. But he also has a real talent for ending up in the midst of violence when he didn't mean to. Having used his wits to escape execution, he begins a series of adventures that take him to street duels in Italy, meetings with remarkable men - from Leonardo Da Vinci to Vlad Dracula - and from the intrigues of the War of the Roses to the fall of Constantinople.", "title": "Tom Swan and the Last Spartans: Part One Florence\n      \n          (Tom Swan and the Last Spartans #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26169969-tom-swan-and-the-last-spartans", "average": 4.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1455967058l/26169969.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/710888.Christian_Cameron", "name": "Christian Cameron"}], "type": ["Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26169969-tom-swan-and-the-last-spartans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26832109-tom-swan-and-the-siege-of-belgrade", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7998933-killer-of-men", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2769326-tyrant", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13550502-the-ill-made-knight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7998944-marathon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13550497-poseidon-s-spear"]}
