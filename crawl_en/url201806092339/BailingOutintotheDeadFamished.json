The story was choppy and there were parts that just suddenly happened with no explanation (suddenly there is a chapter that Taylor was shot and shoved out of the quarantine area. There had been no mention of him for many chapters so it was very strange and no explanation of why he was shot, why they left quarantine). Then it was like she decided to stop with her way of explaining the 4 years ago and Now. To top it all off the the Now changed from being around the time he first met Kan to being at the end of the first book. All and all it was an okay book. I liked the back story on Rudy although it definitely wasn't necessary because she did not explain enough to make it worth it.I honestly don't think this was worth ready. It didn't really provide much to the overall story."}, {"userName": "Katie Fellman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6078742-katie-fellman", "userReview": "OMG I think any girl would be lucky to find a guy like Rudy."}, {"userName": "Eleanor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5268000-eleanor", "userReview": "luved it"}, {"userName": "T.

However, I felt that as the storyline went from now to then that the flow of the story was interrupted making it a little confusing as vital parts of the story was missing. Why did they need to leave like they did? Why was Taylor shot and banished? Overallthough I really liked the book and now can't wait for the final book in the trilogy."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4337141-lindsay", "userReview": "Do you ever fall in love with a character, and then you don't read a book in the series for a while, and you kinda forget how much you love them?
