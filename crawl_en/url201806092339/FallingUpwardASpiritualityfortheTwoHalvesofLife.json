I am glad I did.Rohr has helped me realize that much of the impatience and frustration I have been feeling with certain trends in my profession (I am a teacher at a Catholic high school) may derive from the fact that my own path has moved beyond the institutional structures that inform and often dictate what I can accomplish. Although such structures may be of value for the integrity of the institutions themselves, and for younger teachers who are establishing their identities within it, they are of little use to those who are in the second half of life (and even less so, I suspect, for those in the last quarter of their lives, like me).Our task in the first half of life, Rohr tells us, is to construct \"the proper container\" for our lives and adopt a system of rules that will keep our \u201ccontainer\u201d strong enough to endure the challenges of the early years, all the while permitting the self to flower. First half folks are often obsessed with law, order, custom, tradition, correct rituals, controlling (or refusing to control) passion and pleasure, safety, and intellectual certainty. Second-half folks who get stuck in first-half tasks\u2014or, like me, in a first-half institution\u2014find it difficult to continue their explorations the way the second half of life requires. For us, it is the tragic sense of life that matters, the sense that growth and redemption spring naturally from inevitable sins and necessary sorrows. It is in this\u2014not in any nit-picky concepts of right and wrong\u2014that we find our meaning and consolation. The container itself is no longer enough, and we begin to journey toward an ancient self with a new homesickness, to enter into a second simplicity, to accept, with a new inner brightness, the old inescapable sadness.There are drawbacks to Falling Upward. Stylistically, Rohr has little but clarity to recommend him (although that, in itself, is a great gift), and he is a little too much in the Joseph Campbell/Robert Bly mythic mode for my taste. But there is a lot of wisdom here; I have only touched the surface."}, {"userName": "Kasey Jueds", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2571904-kasey-jueds", "userReview": "I've been reading this book slowly--about a chapter every week, for the past several months--partly because I loved and wanted to savor it, partly because it's so rich that I couldn't take in too much at once. Fr. Rohr is a Franciscan priest with a particularly capacious sense of what it means to be Christian (which I'm not, but this feels like a book about Christianity that is really for everyone). He draws on Buddhism and Jungian thought as well as twelve step programs and the teachings of Jesus, and writes with a lovely and rare sort of clarity and accessibility about matters that are hard to make accessible without dumbing them down. Now that I've finished I feel I could happily start this book again from the beginning and still get so much out of it."}, {"userName": "Caroline Mathews", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5708234-caroline-mathews", "userReview": "I've finished reading \"Falling Upward\" by Fr. Rohr. Not only that but also, I am familiar with much of his research material. I\u2019ve read Bourgeault\u2019s \"Centering Prayer;\" Chodron\u2019s \"Start Where You Are;\" rather much of the Jung, the Xavier, and Pearson\u2019s \"Six Archetypes We Live By.\" When you read a Kindle edition, you don\u2019t usually find the bibliography until last. There isn\u2019t a huge option for an early thumb-through.The index of words, some explained and others neglected, is missing Taoism, but the idea of falling upward into the second life is prominent in Chinese Taoist art. Images of Ma Yaun's \"Two Sages \u2026Under a Plum Tree\" and \"Self-Portrait\" by Shen Chou came into my mind quickly and quietly as I read. Not only for the Taoist, but for the rest of us, life is change. There is the quick, constant change, particularly that shifting of fortune captured daily in Eastern culture by anyone who plays at the \"I Ching;\" the larger, seasonal rotation and stages of life changes (to everything, turn, turn, turn\u2026.); the heroic life's journey into self-awareness i.e. \"The Odyssey\" and \"Monkey;\" and finally, even our Western notion of retirement at age 65. The premise of \"Falling Upward\" is that one must experience the downs of life\u2019s first half in order to fully comprehend, contemplate, and appreciate the ups of the second half. The ups of the second half , which may never be forthcoming, calm us into a new understanding of our impending, inevitable deaths that are not extinction at all but are instead, life everlasting. The book is not simplistic. It is I who am cramming the whole thesis into a nutshell for the sake of time and tide \u2013 which always changing, wait for no man.I woke up an hour ago from a sound sleep remembering my friend Mohammed who is from Cairo. His father retired several years ago. Mohammed told me that in this \u201csecond\u201d half of life, male Muslims become contemplative and studious. The burdens of living are lifted somewhat and they can pursue the Koran and the meanings of life and death. Sure enough, the old gentleman began to spend more time outside of the city in his birth village where he also owned all the land. He read, he talked, he saw a different side of himself. You've read some of my reviews. You know how I get about research and bibliography. You know these types of works become topic papers to me and that I begin to speed read. Yet, the thesis was a good (even if not a new) one, thought provoking, well-said, and well annotated. And the book got me thinking, didn\u2019t it? That is the sign that something is worthy of reading. It gave a new name and further meaning to a concept as old as our collective mythology and certainly well documented by the words of Jesus himself. What sunk in was, first and foremost, that familiar line of Jesus, \u201cDo not be afraid.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to think, to study, to reappraise, to act, or even to die. If the packaging will no longer hold you with your new thoughts, knowledge, ideas, and actions the book suggests you become a new package! Death? It\u2019s nothing to fear, if one is prepared to look at it through the eyes of the Master."}, {"userName": "Pearlie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4025948-pearlie", "userReview": "I was attracted to this book first by the title and then by the cover. And then I thought I have for myself a wonderful book when I read its introduction - it promises a lot of things I was looking for. But alas it feel from the sky to the very depths of the underworld. I could not continue with it and stopped at Chapter 6 with 6 more chapters to go. I was indeed looking forward to read about what it means to build a life in Christ. I did know from the start that Richard Rohr is a Catholic priest, but little did I know he is as one Amazon reviewer termed him as a \"progressive Catholic\". I would say that he is pluralistic more than anything. His views about how life in reality is true and I agree with him. I also agree with him that many areas of our lives and the church needs to undergo a more radical transformation than they have. But I could not agree with his means, and his treatment of theology and Scripture. He gives statements that are blatant and I could not agree with his explanation and justification. For example, his treatment of sin is rather light, with statements like \"you cannot avoid sin...anyway\". I find it too absolute - cannot...anyway. Yes, it is difficult to avoid sin, but something we can do and should strive to do. In reference to Paul's \"It is when I am weak that I am strong\", he writes, \"he was merely building on what he called the 'folly' of the crucifixion on Jesus.\" Merely? He writes that Jesus praised faith and trust more than love. Really? Where in the Bible did he find that? He writes, \"People who know how to creatively break the rules also know why the rules were there in the first place.\" Excuse me? He writes, \"You must first eat the fruit of the garden, so you know what it tastes like.\" If he is referring to the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden...I really do not know how to respond to that. I suppose I can, in a tirade, but I am just rendered speechless for now. And this is among the last ones that made me stop reading the book: he writes, \"There is not one clear theology of God, Jesus, or history presented, despite our attempt to pretend there is.\" I rest my case."}, {"userName": "Terry", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2827349-terry", "userReview": "Richard Rohr is a Catholic priest and founder of the Center for Action and Contemplation in Albuquerque, NM. This book examines the arc of spiritual growth through our adult lives, using concepts from psychology and mythology to help illuminate the transitions that lead us on this spiritual journey. The sub-title, \"A Spirituality for the Two Halves of Life\" invokes Carl Jung's idea of \"two halves of life\" -- the 1st where we internalize rules, discover who we are, enter a career, marriage, etc. We build the \"container\" of our lives in the 1st half. The \"second half of life\" is spent discovering what that container holds and finding that God enlarges the container with His grace. While Rohr makes it clear that deep spiritual understanding and growth isn't limited by age, the fact is that most people are in their mid-40s or later before they start on this \"second journey\". I have found my own concepts of God and my own spiritual needs changing and morphing in ways that have sometimes been troubling. Rohr's book has confirmed that the questions that arise with age and experience are not only a common experience, but a necessary one if we are to recapture our \"true selves\" before God. This spiritual journey brings freedom and a centeredness to our lives, but demands our continued personal growth. As we grow into a \"second half of life spirituality\", we become more loving, more inclusive, more compassionate, more introspective. Our lives more fully reflect God's grace, which allows us to more fully do His work."}, {"userName": "Mary Frances", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361729-mary-frances", "userReview": "I was less than impressed with this book. I did find a few nuggets of wisdom, but as with much of Rohr's writings it seems as if he thinks his readers need simplistic explanations, and as always it's very self referential. Rohr's good thoughts are too often marred in his writings by a sense that he is not sharing a journey but lecturing to poor souls who aren't able to get his profound wisdom. And since a great deal of what he says is not profound, it get annoying. The worst section was when he presents a Thomas Merton poem to illustrate a point but then, not content to let Merton's words speak to the reader as they will, he deconstructs the poem as a \"meditation\" by explaining the \"meaning\" of the lines in his own much less evocative language. I have often garnered a bit of insight from Rohr's work , esp. His work on the enneagram, but this may be my last foray into his work."}, {"userName": "Glen Grunau", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2499125-glen-grunau", "userReview": "This book was uncanny in clarifying many of the often confusing inner movements of my life in the past 5+ years. Could it be that I have been encountering a \"falling upward\" from a \"first-half-of-life\" into a \"second half of life\"? Although there is a newly acquired peace and softness that comes with this \"falling\" Rohr reminds us that we do not attain this second-half-of life simply as a factor of our chronological age. In fact, he speaks of how deeply saddened he is whenever he finds old folks stuck in first-half-of-life, as illustrated by how they \"are still full of themselves and their absolute opinions about everything\". In fact, he suggests that most people will end up stuck here . . . \"unless people have done their inner work, at least some shadow work, and thereby entered into wisdom, or non-dualistic thinking\". His chapter on \"The Shadowlands\" invites us to confront the shadow of our persona or false self - the one that we all must spend the first-half-of-life erecting from our ego in order to survive in our world and make ourselves acceptable and loveable in the eyes of others. I was sobered by his litmus test for unfinished shadow work (work which by the way is never done, but well along the way with second=half-of-life people): \"Invariably, whenever something upsets you, and you have a strong emotional reaction out of proportion to the moment, your shadow self has just been exposed . . . notice that the cock of St. Peter has just crowed!\" Although there is much in this book that has given me hope, there was plenty to keep me humble, particularly as I recognize the extensive \"shadow boxing\" still required in my life. It is no secret to those who know me well that I have become increasingly dis-enfranchised with my church experience in recent years. Rohr explained for me much of my dissatisfaction within this \"upward falling\" phenomenon. In fact, his treatment of much of organized religion, although indicting, was also quite gracious. He suggests that \"most groups and institutions (including churches) are first-half-of-life structures that are necessarily concerned with identity, boundaries, self-maintenance, self-perpetuation, and self-congratulation\". If we recognize this, it guards us from losing hope by having false expectations and expecting, or even demanding, what these groups cannot give. It follows, of course, that to judge or condemn these organizations is proof that we are still likely first-half-of-life people. Rohr goes on to suggest that \"in the second-half-of-life, you can actually bless others in what they feel they must do, allow them to do what they must do, challenge them if they are hurting themselves or others - but you can no longer join them in the first half of life.\" This reflected very closely my recent ability to inwardly bless and wish my best friend success in his recent joining of our church board - the same church board that I recently left for what I now sense are many of the reasons Rohr seems to cover in this book. Much of this falling upward has involved what Rohr calls a \"necessary suffering\" - to strip away some of the ego agendas that comprise so much of the \"first half of life\". Two of the greatest \"wisdom\" gifts I have been given in the last 5 years are offered by Rohr in two of his previous books - a willingness to accept necessary suffering (\"Everything Belongs\") and the freedom to move beyond the judging, categorizing dualistic mind into the freedom of non-dualistic thinking (\"The Naked Now\"). In this book, Rohr further develops these ideas, among others, to illustrate the journey into a second-half-of-life. As usual, Richard draws heavily from the gospels to reveal how Jesus, whom Rohr calls the first non-dualistic teacher to the West, was a second-half-of-life-man who was given the unenviable task of trying to teach and reach and be understood by a largely first-half-of-life history, church, and culture. No wonder they judged, excluded, and ultimately killed him! But Rohr also draws from the world's great mythologies to illustrate how this second-half-of-life wisdom, and the pilgrimage required to attain it, is represented in the collective unconscious of humanity and illustrated in such great stories as Homer's tale The Odyssey - written 700 years before Christ! This particular emphasis on truth revealed in the stories and fables of humanity very much reminded me of the premise of another book that had a significant impact on me in years past - The Sacred Romance, by John Eldredge. I'm not sure how much this book will be appreciated by those who have not read some of Rohr's earlier work. But for anyone willing to entertain the notion that old age does not automatically lead to wisdom, it is a provocative read."}, {"userName": "Ashlula Ayse ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ashlula-ayse", "userReview": "\"God hides and is found, precisely in the depths of everything....Sin is to stay on the surface of even holy things....\"\"Once you touch upon the Real, there is an inner insistence that the Real, if it is the Real, has to be forever.\"This book is a guide for realizing your path, shedding your excess and becoming wiser.

As it states, it defines and targets the second phase of ones life; where most of the tools in your toolbox from the first phase (that were so useful in excelling in life and constructing your shell), simply won't work. This book focuses on the meaning of ones naked existence (without titles, riches, possessions); the role of evil, the difference between suffering and enduring. Its a great book if you are at a point in life where you are counting your gains and losses, and ready to dive into a new adventure behind the looking glass.The author makes references to some of my favorite philosopher/writers like Unamuno, Pema Chodron,CG Jung and Fromm; and his thinking is inline with them. Although the author cites the Bible many times, this book is more of a philosophical approach to the meaning of existence and maturation, than just a religious reading.

But I was more irritated by the platitudes this read. There are wisdom all over this book. The overall theme is a good and important one. But because you sound esoteric, does not mean you are wise. There are lots of instances where I just wish he would speak clearly without so many 'wise' quotes. Some of those quotes really are helpful. the second full review is on my blog at http://bookwi.se/falling-upward/Short review: This is a book about embracing maturity. Age is not maturity, we all know immature people that are advanced in years. Rohr believes that we need to embrace the different parts of life. Our younger years are concerned with identity (what we do, who we marry, etc.). Our older years should be concerned with meaning. So if we properly understand how to mature, we live inside the structures of of life in our younger years and then we learn when to leave the structures of live in our older years.This is in interesting book. Rohr uses the story of Odysseus as a structure for understanding maturity. He is quite fluent in modern psychology and anthropology as well as the ancient myths. Rohr believes that the ancient myths in many ways better understand how we should live.

It is one of the finest books I have read on the spiritual journey. I am considering using it in a spirituality and work class that I teach, even though the students are not at mid-life. I think the book addresses important concepts relevant to people of all ages, and all faiths.I have read many of Richard Rohr's books, and this is amongst my favorites. While sometimes critical of organized religion, Father Rohr writes eloquently about how religion can be a healthy or unhealthy experience. This is not a book for people who believe that fundamentalism (of any type) is the road to salvation. Rohr is pluralistic, open, and fully engaged in all that life has to offer. Of critical importance is his message that we learn more from our crucibles in life than we do from our major successes. This book is particularly relevant during these difficult times, as it emphasizes that we must embrace all that happening in our lives--both good and bad. When I counsel students, I cite from page 6 of this book that reminds us that \"Be Not Afraid\" is stated 365 times in the Bible.

Maybe the best day of the vacation was listening to six hours of tapes on my journey home ripe with the quest to explore more in-depth spiritually. We had conversations that were new to us. Finally able to ask the right questions and free enough to risk responding openly as we see it now, knowing we are incomplete, but seeking wholeness. I love Richard's incorporation of quotes from spiritual leaders of all times, poets, anthropologists, psychologists, and \"thinkers\". Being a Catholic, and like Rohr less a Roman Catholic, I appreciate how he incorporates the real gems of my faith into his guide. A lot of what I have discovered, am working towards, was clarified with this wisdom. I will buy the book to mark up and reread again and again. I am encouraged that I will use my current and future \"stumbling blocks\"in ways that will bring me more peace. Maybe being a grandparent and seeing parents in their later years gives me pause to ask \"where do I fit in? What will yield the fruit I am to produce?\" I have been doing some Falling Upwards work through Alanon and my new franciscan based church community where Rohr's \"everything belongs\" is a motto. His \"Both/And\" inclusionary philosophy is biblically referenced which strengthens my love for the pursuit of that spirit which is within us all. Being a fan of biographies, I want to read Merton, Dali Lama, Helen Keller, and others who lived a full second half life.  Being a fan of The Wizard of Oz, I love his metaphor of Dorothy coming home, but the world is all different. I have much work to do, I guess I have fallngs in my future that will yield me peace, fuller acceptance and less shadows and more light."}, {"userName": "Kevin Fuller", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6122502-kevin-fuller", "userReview": "Mr. Rohr does us all a service with this gem by applying Jungian thought and Joseph Campbell mythology to spirituality. By doing so, he has tapped into a deeper strata of the religious life and requested we all take the Hero's Quest with him.Beginning with the plight of Odysseus, (love the homeric reference material) Rohr highlights that the quest will be fraught with danger and temptation and will always be an invitation to go even further than what the initial task requires. Home is where the heart is, but alas, in this earthly sphere, we may never arrive!'The Two Halves' refers to Jung's program of life, where in the first half, we build the Ego and secure a 'living'. There is more, however to this story, and oftentimes the unconscious pushes us into terra incognito...thrusts us into an initiation of maturity, that if heeded, brings a fuller, richer energy to the Self, or the totality of the conscious Ego and unconscious Archetypes. And this journey, the journey of the Self is nothing, if not Archetypal and transpersonal.Drawing from the great world Traditions, (not Christianity alone), Mr. Rohr effectively poses many prescient questions and even offers answers to boot."}, {"userName": "Jordan Shirkman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17519772-jordan-shirkman", "userReview": "If you\u2019re expecting a book about how the gospel and following Jesus lead us to maturity and into the \u201csecond half of life\u201d, this is not the book for you. That was what I expected from a Franciscan priest. Father Richard Rohr has strayed so far from orthodoxy that anything and everything\u2013Buddhism, Islam, Zen Masters and some out-of-context teachings of Jesus\u2013can lead us to the second half of life. In this second half, he encourages us to to fall down and get back up through our own enlightenment about what life is really all about. A fine sentiment, but ultimately an unsatisfying explanation of how that is to take place through rejecting any and all faiths in their orthodox forms and looking deep within to find our meaning. Here\u2019s what I enjoyed about the book:  It\u2019s not age that leads us to maturity, but how we handle suffering and what we learn from those experiences. \n   It\u2019s easy for us to be so content in the comfortable at \u201chome\u201d that we never venture out and thus never truly grow and understand. \n    His observation about Westerners not being comfortable to hold in tension truths that at first seem paradoxically but are actually congruent and trying to rush to a conclusion too quickly rings true for me personally.  \n   There are a handful of quotes worth pondering: \n   \u201cMore suffering comes into the world by people taking offense than by people intending to give offense.\u201d \u2013 Ken Keyes \n   \u201cWe can save ourselves a lot of distress and accusation by knowing when, where, to whom, and how to talk about spiritually mature things.\u201d  \n   \u201cWhen we are only victorious in small things, it leaves us feeling small.\u201d  \n   \u201cYou learn how to recover from falling by falling.\u201d  \n   \u201cWe clergy have gotten ourselves into the job of \u2018sin management\u2019 instead of sin transformation.\u201d \n   \u201cSelf-help\u2026will help you only if you pay attention to life itself.\u201d  \n   That\u2019s where the good abruptly stops.Here\u2019s what I hated about the book:   He slams orthodoxy and fundamentalism constantly and essentially rules it out as a path for growth and \u201cenlightenment.\u201d He views historical Christian views (and historical, orthodox views of other religions for that matter) as an obstacle rather than a path. \n   He uses the same quotes from the same people and examples from the same stories ad nauseam. Odysseus this and that, Lady Julian \u201cfall\u2026and\u2026recover(y)\u2026both are the mercy of God\u201d, Carl Jung almost every chapter. It\u2019s fine to have a favorite few authors, but he doesn\u2019t just quote them on different topics, he uses the same quote from the same author multiple times. \n   His exegesis of the (admittedly many) Bible passages cited is gut-wrenchingly bad. He takes so many passages out of context and obscures the meaning or rips out a pair of verses out of the context a passage to give it whatever meaning he wants. He does this so often I can\u2019t cite all of the examples here. The worst is when he mentions Jesus saying to let the wheat and the weeds grow together (Matthew 13:29-30) as an argument for universalism, ignoring the end of verse 30 when Jesus says to bundle up the weeds to be burned.  \n   His use of scare quotes is unbelievable and belittles majority understanding whenever he gets a chance. \u201cSalvation\u201d \u201cheaven\u201d and \u201chell\u201d are all just made up terms that are actually connected to modern psychology. He assigns whatever meaning he wants to Jesus\u2019s words. \n   Rohr tries to use exceptions to make the rule, in the case of \u201csalvation.\u201d He says that because there are mentally ill people, we can\u2019t believe \u201cany of our theories about the necessity of some kind of correct thinking as the definition of \u2018salvation.\u2019\u201d \n   He puts all of \u201cChristian Europe\u201d at fault for entering into WWI + WWII, and implies that they shouldn\u2019t have tolerated those wars (leaving the option of tolerating Hitler and Stalin\u2019s destruction of millions of people). He also reminds us that the \u201cofficial church\u201d (whatever that means) doesn\u2019t say that Hitler and Stalin are in hell (a place that is merely where we put ourselves by not growing).  \n   Rohr can\u2019t rectify a loving and just God. His god simply allows and accepts all things and acts (like those of Hitler and Stalin) and just wants people to grow beyond systems and orthodox religion. \n   Although any Bible-reading Christian from a non-cult sect would say that Jesus is the Son of God and that he died to pay for the sins of man, Rohr tells us that there is no one theology of Jesus so there can\u2019t be any true theology of Jesus. \n   He mocks substitutionary atonement because he built a strawman argument which completely misses what it is. He doesn\u2019t understand that Jesus didn\u2019t die so that God would love us, but Jesus died because God loves us.  \n   He comments on the fact that many other religions do a better job of understanding God and man, yet remains a \u201cCatholic\u201d because of the \u201ctools\u201d the church gave him. Tools which apparently allowed him to deny all of that church\u2019s doctrine and still call himself a priest. \n   I nearly threw the book away at page 102 when he talks down at us for misunderstanding God. Although earlier Rohr commends paradoxes, when he finds one he doesn\u2019t like, he condemns it. He tells us that \u201cIf you accept a punitive notion of God\u2026you have an absurd universe where most people on this earth end up being more loving than God.\u201d So he tells us that a loving God cannot be a just God, fully contrary to Jesus\u2019s own teachings. He goes on to say that Jesus\u2019s love is unconditional and never requires anything, except that in all of the passages he mentions Jesus loves the people and commends them for their faith in him. Rohr also pretends that Jesus never mentioned hell, although he did so more than any other person in the New Testament. \n   Although he does some things in humility, his hubris is frustrating and laughable at times: \u201cThe only people who do not believe that the Enneagram is true are those who do not understand it or have never used it well.\u201d So we can\u2019t believe any faith is the end all be all, but the Enneagram is?  \n   The above list is not exhaustive. I\u2019ll summarize by saying this: It\u2019s not just that I disagree with the Rohr (which I expect to some degree with any author) it\u2019s that he pretends to write with humility yet comes across constantly with an air of superiority. He says things like, \u201cIt is very surprising to me that so many Christians who read the Scriptures do not see this\u201d as he explains that you must leave any religion or system to truly mature since these systems and faiths are too limiting. He tells us that if our view of heaven excludes anyone (i.e. if it isn\u2019t universalism) then it is not heaven. So now Rohr gets to define heaven instead of the Creator of Heaven defining it. This book is a mixed bag of the occasional encouraging or thought-provoking quote, but the bag is mixed mostly with garbage and I don\u2019t recommend plodding through the frustrating contradictions, statements of superiority, and New Age \u201clook within\u201d and reject-the-system junk that it requires to find the rare gem."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/454028-kate", "userReview": "It has been a long time since I wrote in the margins of a book, or even underlined anything. I found myself pulling out a pen to highlight much of what Father Rohr had to say. I give away almost every book I read. But this one is a keeper. Rohr writes about the two halves of life, focusing on the second half--the half more neglected by society, but the wisdom of which is desperately needed. He explains what should, but often doesn't happen in that first half of life; the consequences of our permanent cultural adolescence, and how we might grow beyond that adolescence into full, free, grace-filled selves. If that sounds distinctively Christian, it is. Father Rohr is very comfortable in interfaith circles, but he has a decidedly Franciscan vein in his approach to spirituality. Hebrew and Christian scriptures pop up regularly in his prose, but in fresh, deep ways. His scholarship is also very deep, quoting everyone from Church Founders to Paul Ricouer. He is challenging, but in a deeply personal, friendly way.This deceptively short, little book took a long time to digest, because it is densely packed with thought-provoking spiritual gems like this one, a quote from Ken Keyes: \"More suffering comes into the world by those taking offense than by those intending to give offense.\" Or his own \"I do not think you should get rid of your sin until you have learned what it has to teach you.\" Pretty pithy, eh? The book is not just some quick feel-good devotional read. It's a real thought-provoker--something you can spend hours reflecting on, as I did.Father Rohr points out, again and again, that there is a path here, through the later years of life, as age and the slings and arrows of existence take their toll, if we pay attention long enough to find the path. It can lead us home, and it can lead us into generativity and contributions to the greater good of society. Great message. Great book. I really, really liked it. So, why did I not LOVE it? Why four stars and not five? For someone who is basking in the uncertainties and quirks of human experience, there are some things he's a little too sure of himself about. He seems to think that people who turn out best have so-called \"conservative\" upbringings. Now, the conservative reader of this review may be either pumping their head up in down in fierce agreement, and the more liberal reader may be squinting in doubt right now. Being more progressive myself, I question this statement. From what follows in the book, I think he means to say, people who turn out best have consistent structure in their early lives. A family with liberal values can have just as consistent a structure as a family with conservative values. Conservative is a loaded word in this day and age, and its meaning is not at all clear anymore. He is also carried away with the \"truth\" of the enneagram--a system of categorizing the human personality that he has studied deeply and on which he is, by all accounts, an expert. I have no bone to pick with the usefulness of the enneagram. However, people deeply connected to theories often confuse the map of their theory for the far more nuanced and complex territory of reality. Father Rohr errs into this territory with his comments on the enneagram, useful map though it might be. In addition, and this is my biggest bone to pick with him, he steeps the book in masculine hero tales, and then says, basically, \"Ladies, you can go find your equivalent lady hero tale.\" Well, it's not necessarily equivalent. Women's spiritual development may look very different than men's spiritual development, as many authors have pointed out. Father Rohr could have given that more than a passing sentence and done a little more to address more than half his audience, whom, I assume, are female. Finally, he identifies Victor Turner as a leader of the male spirituality movement. Victor Turner was not that. Victor Turner was an anthropologist--an expert in ritual process whose work was frequently appropriated by the male spirituality movement, mostly by the Joseph Campbell, mythopoetic crowd. I have nothing against that crowd crediting Victor Turner with some of their basic tenets, but he wasn't some big Male Spirituality Guru. Not a big deal. I just want Rohr to get it right.But don't think that, because of these points, I didn't get a lot out of \"Falling Upward\".

The book is well worth reading and thinking about. Fr. Rohr has many good things to say. But I found it less helpful to me than other books like it.Many of his most helpful and thoughtful sayings are mixed with what read like simplistic put-downs of people living according to what he describes as the \"first half\" of life. He also makes some broad generalizations about how \"most people\" for most of our history, and many for most all of their lives, never mature into truly \"second half of life\" people. This may be true, but it seems a bit overdone to me; as if to invite his readers to consider themselves, along with the author, to be more enlightened than most for seeing themselves in the book or for, at least, being inclined to read it. This sort of thing nearly spoiled the book for me.I'm a little skeptical of approaches to spirituality that seem to overemphasize finding God within oneself. There's some truth to it, I think. We are made in God's Image and can grow to be more Christlike though the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Greater self understanding is essential to understanding our relationship to God. But it can also lead to self-justification, even at the expense of others in the relative judgements we then make about them. We can end up trusting too much in our own inclinations as a basis for our understanding of God.Fr. Rohr illustrates many of his points with scripture references often taken out of context. He seems to use the Bible to illustrate his own point of view in many places, rather than as the inspiration for it. Examples of this have been pointed out by other reviewers of the book, leading some of the book's advocates to comment that such a concern for biblical accuracy is the mark of a \"first half\" person. Ugh. Maybe. Maybe not.For such a strong advocate of non-dualistic, \"both-and\" thinking, Fr. Rohr sure relies heavily on what seems to me to be more dualistic, \"either-or\" distinctions between \"first half\" and \"second half\" people with their respective concerns for their \"container\" vs. its \"contents.\" There is the \"shadow self\" and the \"true self.\" While there is some validity in these distinctions, they can also make it too easy to pigeonhole others and put ourselves in a category apart, beyond the understanding of others and the flaws they might expose in our own way of thinking and living. Then there are statements like this: \"Either God is for everybody and the divine DNA is somehow in all of the creatures, or this God is not God by any common definition, or even much of a god at all\" (p. 109). Really? It's just that simple? Hmm.As I've said, there are many wise and insightful words in this book, but I think it should be read with some detachment and discernment. I have a hard time accepting that everything Fr. Rohr describes as a second half quality of life, which resonates with my experience or outlook on life, is a mark of spiritual maturity. I think spiritual maturity can take different forms in different people depending on their personality and the situations with which life confronts them. Rohr's description may be one of them but I wonder if it may be just as much a product of cultural influence as he says the first half of life is. The \"container\" and its \"contents\" may not be so easy to distinguish at any stage of life, if such a distinction even makes sense. Maybe that's OK. I think I can live without it.As an alternative to this book, I would highly recommend Loving Jesus, by Mark Allan Powell."}, {"userName": "Craig Bergland", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5542187-craig-bergland", "userReview": "Easily the most important book I have read for understanding my own spiritual journey since Thomas Merton's \"Seven Storey Mountain.\" More importantly, Fr. Rohr's descriptions of the two halves of life explain precisely why the Church lacks mentors - so many Church leaders across traditions over the last one hundred years never transitioned from the first half of life to the second, never moved from being completely fixated on building something to a more mature spirituality that would have allowed them to become mentors, allowed them to train and educate those who would succeed them. This choice left them advanced in years trying to do a young person's job and wondering why they lacked the energy and the insight to do that job. The tragedy is that they missed the opportunity to become the elders both the Church and the world so desperately need.It does not matter if you are in the first half of life or the second, this book will speak to you and help you understand why you are where you are at this precise moment in your journey.

My friends have observed that about me and exploit it for comedic effect; my younger friends like to tell me what grade they or their parents were in when I passed through some key rite of passage; my older friends like to remind me that I haven't been a kid for a long time and that there is a fiber-rich diet in my future. They laugh when they see me stress out over such comments, but I'll get the last laugh, I think: the younger ones will eventually themselves be old; the older ones will eventually be dead.The passage of time is certainly fascinating to me, but it's made more profound and troubling by its association with questions of vocation. \"What do I want to be when I grow up?\" is a question that plagued me for a long time but that has long since been replaced with \"What am I doing with my life?\" or, worse, \"What am I going to do with the rest of my life?\" In the face of such weighty questions, a simple vision for aging and calling is undeniably attractive. I found such a simple vision in Richard Rohr's Falling Upward.I saw Rohr speak on this topic at the 2011 inaugural Wild Goose Festival and was immediately won over to his take on it. The basic premise is this: we spend the first half of our life building the container into which we will pour the product of the second half of our life. Our first half is preoccupied with externals--status, yes, but also personal rules and priorities, a vision for how life should be. In the second half we turn our eyes from such externals and start to note both what they've done and failed to do for us, what they've allowed us to do in life and what our preoccupation with them has cost us and those we love. The first half is the search for identity; the second half is the search for serenity.That is probably oversimplifying things, but Rohr's premise is alarmingly simple. There are two distinct calls placed on us in life; the first is provisional, preparing us for the second. The transition from one call to the next is often precipitated by crisis, but more generally by a sense that the first call is completed, or incomplete: it cannot fulfill a life in and of itself.The notion of \"falling\" enters in at this transitional moment. We experience the death of a loved one, or the collapse of a profession that we had come to define ourselves by, or the end of a relationship that we thought was forever. Or we start to notice that the things we have invested so heavily in for so long are simply not returning their investment; they don't prop us up so much as trap us inside themselves. We feel ourselves in free fall, all the while hearing a whisper to some higher aspiration. We are being beckoned beyond ourselves; we are, it turns out, falling up.This transition calls for wisdom and humility and resolve. \"The human ego prefers anything,\" Rohr writes, \"just about anything, to falling or changing or dying. The ego is that part of you that loves the status quo, even when it is not working. It attaches to past and present, and fears the future.\" Rohr suggests that most people actually never enter into the second half of life; rather than fall upward they grasp tightly to some artificial anchor to the present--they make an idol of their kids or their spouse or their job or their car--and drown out the divine whisper with TV and music and corporate worship and even their own inner diatribes against the status quo. People who reject the second call don't become the elders that ground a culture and give it a future; they just become old--wrinkly, crotchety, useless. They have neglected or even rejected the search for their true self, the self beyond the reputation that they've often carefully cultivated. They never ceased being the persona they created to occupy the space they found themselves in, and so never die to themselves only to be resurrected into what their community needs, their God demands and they themselves have always wanted to be. \"Your stage mask is not bad, evil, or necessarily egocentric; it is just not 'true,'\" Rohr writes. \"It is manufactured and sustained unconsciously by your mind; but it can and will die, as all fictions must die.\"That's the thing: we should outlive our fictional selves. The world needs us to, because in order to run well it can't itself be bothered by these deeper truths. We need ourselves to, because we will search in vain for the ultimate meaning of our lives without the perspective of the second call. The people we love need us to, because the grace God invests in us is dispensed best and perhaps only out of this second half of life. \"The classic spiritual journey always begins elitist and ends egalitarian.\" In other words, only our elders (in the truest sense of that word) can give us what we need for our own spiritual journeys, and they can only do it by forsaking their own impulses toward elitism. The truest elders among us, like Desmond Tutu or the Dalai Lama, are sometimes the most childlike.The book wasn't perfect. For as much as Rohr avers that not everyone achieves their second calling (in fact most don't), it often comes across as an inevitability, which will reinforce in some old (but not elder) readers their automatic moral and spiritual superiority over people who are younger than they are. The old, crotchety people I know don't need any such reinforcement, and so I'd be reluctant to put this book in front of them. Rohr also implies that Christian doctrine is the enemy of the second call, that the codes of conduct and the attitude of exclusivity that attends to most organized religion (not just his own religion, although he minces no words about the state of contemporary Christianity) is helpful for the immature but to the person on the second journey seems silly. He may well be right, but his argument feels a little thin (and self-serving), and will be a bridge too far for many readers.Bottom line: this book, like any book that aspires to call someone from one developmental stage to the next, should be read mainly by those with ears to hear. And those folks should read it more than once. So, probably, should those who read it without ears to hear; the second or third time might be the charm."}, {"userName": "Bob", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob", "userReview": "Summary: Richard Rohr focuses on what he sees are the key developmental tasks for each \"half\" of life, using the image of the container for the first half, and contents for the second.I'll be honest. This is not a book I can wholeheartedly recommend. While I found a number of useful insights, I thought the \"spirituality\" on which Rohr grounded these more reflective of a \"blend\" of Eastern and Western spirituality rather than the Catholic Christianity with which Father Rohr is most closely identified. For some, that may not be a problem, or even is a plus! If you are looking for a spirituality that roots an understanding of development in classic Christianity, whether Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant/Evangelical, that is not this book.First for the insights I most appreciated, which I think come out of long pastoral work with people seeking to grow in their faith throughout life. There are two key insights that are important:First, there is the insight that life can be divided into two halves with the key task of the first being fashioning the \"container\" of one's life and that the second half is devoted to the \"contents\" of that container. The first half is the structures of rules, disciplines, community. This occurs in a healthy way when these things are present in an atmosphere of unconditional love. Where love is lacking or the structures are lacking, the container is inadequate for the second half task. The second half, then focuses on the contents of life, the becoming of a unique person who knows how to draw from all these structures and yet go beyond them.Second, there is the title idea of \"falling upward\". At some point, there is a necessary \"fall\"--failure, suffering, tragedy. In some sense the first half \"container\" may have prepared you to face these, and yet is inadequate of itself to do so. It is time, in Rohr's words to \"discharge your loyal soldier.\" It is often in the facing of our fallenness and finiteness and imperfection that we become fully human as we stop trying to be what we are not, and begin to pursue a life of grace, of calling, of wholeness, discovering our True Self. Those who resist \"falling upwards\" go on in life to become cynical, emptily driven, emotionally detached and judgmental individuals. This is the story of the elder son in the story of the Prodigal.There are several key places where I believe Rohr is articulating a spirituality grounded more in a \"new age\" spirituality than in Christian orthodoxy, despite is warm avowals of how for him Christ is the center. For one thing, he articulates a new age account of the fall of Adam and Eve as a \"necessary fall\" for their development of consciousness. I would agree with the formative nature of failure, transgression, and suffering that comes to the foot of the cross and finds grace. That is different from a theology that says the fall was necessary for the evolution of our consciousness. One involves restoration of what was lost through the cross. The other seems to involve evolutionary progress where a cross is superfluous.A second place is Rohr's proposal that \"heaven\" and \"hell\" have to do with our consciousness, rather than ultimate destinies. Certainly, our consciousness can be \"heavenly\" or \"hellish.\" Views like this have become popular of late, perhaps as alternatives to ugly forms of \"hell fire preachers\". Yet I wonder if the grace Rohr speaks of can be meaningful without there being a real judgment. Finally, Rohr seems to propose that our development is really through a transformation of consciousness through the \"falling upward\" experience, perhaps aided by the Spirit of God, rather true spiritual rebirth. There is language of \"union with ourselves and everything else\" that seems more the language of pantheistic monism than of being \"at-one\" with God in Christ. In fact, it seems at times that Rohr is among those who say that all religions are really saying the same thing and that those who say otherwise are guilty of \"either-or\" thinking. I would contend that the difference between a \"both-and\" view that wipes out distinctives and the Christian faith is that the Christian faith is a faith of reconciliation--a third way between \"either\" and \"or\" that doesn't wipe out distinctions but reconciles them in Christ.This is regrettable in my view because his insights into the two halves of life and the transition of what I might call \"fall into re-formation\" may be grounded far more robustly is what C. S. Lewis would call \"mere Christianity.\" There are so many things that, for one living in the second half, connected deeply for me. His description of \"the second simplicity\" and the \"bright sadness\" ring true. I think part of what so many like in Rohr, and I've appreciated in his other writings is his ability to capture the imagination and heart in his word paintings. However, as one who cares about the second half journey and believes it is best grounded in \"mere Christianity\" I would recommend Hagberg and Guelich's \ufeffThe Critical Journey as one of the best books I've come across on the issues of our life journeys."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1659159-edward", "userReview": "Rohr's message about the two halves of life (\"young\" and \"old\") is that essentially one has to fail or descend in some way before one can rise and ascend. On an obvious level, as one ages, one begins to lose strength, health, and finally life itself. Some people never recover from the experience and spend all of their time lamenting their decline and fall. I remember my mother, ordinarily a upbeat person, during her late 80's saying, \"getting old is hell.\"  What can Rohr find about old age, the second half of life, that is good? He begins by referring to Scott Peck's contention that unless we undergo some kind of \"falling apart\" in our lives, we won't work at transforming ourselves. We'd just rather stay on the intellectual and spiritual path we're on, even if it doesn't go anywhere. What Rohr is suggesting is that the second half of life is an opportunity, given that we ARE \"falling apart\" (some more than others, and perhaps the ones who have experienced the greatest disappointments in life have the greatest opportunities to grow in their later years)to finally create meaning in our lives.  Rohr stresses being influenced by archetypal journey stories such as the Exodus of Moses, Odysseus' long voyage to reach home, Mohammed's several key flights, Jesus' four kinds of soil, the \"way of the cross\" images on church walls the insights of St. John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila, and in the modern era, Carl Jung, Jean Piaget, James Fowler, Lawrence Kohlber, Clare Graves, Jean Gebser, Abraham Maslow, Erick Erikson, Ken Wilber, Carol Gilligan, Daniel Levinson, Bill Plotkin, among others - a reading list to keep a reader busy the rest of his life!  \"Home\", Rohr says, is the beginning and the end of our journeys. It's a metaphor for our true identity, our soul. He doesn't mention one \"journey\" that I thought of, embodied in the game of baseball, the object of which is to set out from homeplate, and if successful to travel around the bases and in the end to return \"home\" again. What he does mention, though, is that the first half of life is made up of efforts to establish a \"container\" for our lives, one made up of our identity, our security, learning to define our sexuality and gender. We do much of this through our occupations and creation of a family. The second half of our lives, though, is to find the \"contents\" of this container. That means a kind of contemplation that stresses what we have in common with others, not what differentiates us, as we tend to concentrate on when we're young.  That's not to say there are any easy answers. The greatest sins we can commit are ones of superficiality and blindness. Nothing about life is certain and we have to endure the mysteries of doubt and finally death. That includes a realization of the pain of others, without which we cannot live very humanely.  One of the greatest dangers to a clear view of reality in the last half of our lives is what has been called the \"shadow self\" ,a self-image which is \"created out of your own mind, desire, and choice, and everyone else's preferences for you. It floats around in Plato's unreal world of ideas. It is not objective at all but utterly subjective (which doesn't mean it does not have real influence).\" You need to find out who you really are, what the Zen masters call \"the face you had before you were born,\" or as Christ put it, \"you must recognize the plank in your own eye, and only then will you see clearly enough to take the splinter out of your brother or sister's eye.\" If you never deal with this shadow self, then you'll endure a miserable old age, always blaming others for not treating you well.  Does any of this make sense, or has Rohr written a facile and empty self-help book for elders? I think it avoids that:, it is more a book of suggested directions to find fulfillment in old age. Every person has to find his own way \"home\", of course, and every journey is different. But Rohr's approach is grounded in the use of universal archetypes, and I think that\u2019s as a good a way to proceed as any."}, {"userName": "Thomas Holbrook", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2310752-thomas-holbrook", "userReview": "Richard Rohr, writer, activist, lecturer, Franciscan Priest, has lived long and reflected deeply upon that living.

The next 168 pages are likewise dense.\tFr. Rohr\u2019s premise is that life is divided into two halves. The first half is spent building a \u201ccontainer\u201d (education, career, family, identify, etc.) for our life. The second half can be the filling of that container with fullness, depth, simplicity leading to the individual becoming an \u201celder\u201d for those in the first half of life. This \u201cFalling Upward\u201d of the second half of life brings about a wideness of life, the understanding of rules as suggestions for life but they are to be followed only as far as they create connection and relationship.\tUsing poetry, a lot of Biblical Scripture, Depth and Self Psychology, Mythology and a Wisdom Literature from a broad spectrum of faith systems, the author makes a strong argument for his case. He speaks clearly of the need to embrace the pain and tragedy common to life, letting it teach us the richness that comes from living full and which can occur only by surrendering what we think we know and the expectations of how things should be. Only by doing so can one fill the \u201ccontainer\u201d of life\u2019s \u201cfirst half,\u201d giving it meaning definition and the wideness of true freedom.\t\u201cEvery time God forgives us, God is saying that God\u2019s own rules do not matter as much as the relationship that God wants to create with us.\u201d (p. 57).\t\u201cThe more you exclude, the more hellish and lonely your existence is.\u201d (p. 101)\tRepeatedly, Fr. Rohr reminds the reader that \u201cGod writes straight using crooked lines,\u201d and the both of life\u2019s \u201chalves\u201d reflect the truth that we are the \u201cwriting\u201d brought about by such Grace. \tThere is much depth, reality and heart-freeing truth found in this book that to hint at its benefit to me would require a long in-person discussion of each chapter.

Nor will everything be perfect if I follow a prescribed theology or path. Rohr covers so much in these few short pages and I've just flipped the book back to the front cover to begin it again. It's just that good. If its description appeals to a potential reader, give it a whirl. However, this book is not for those who see life as black and white. Those who cannot embrace a bright sadness or the ambiguity of gray should look for something else to read."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6571843-elizabeth", "userReview": "[From amazon.com interview with author] What do you mean by the two halves of life? The phrase \u201ctwo halves of life\u201d was first popularized by Carl Jung, the Swiss psychologist. He says that there are two major tasks. In the first half [of life] you've got to find your identity, your significance; you create your ego boundaries, your ego structure, what I call \u201cthe creating of the container.\u201d But that's just to get you started. In the second half of life, once you've created your ego structure, you finally have the courage to ask: What is this all for? What am I supposed to do with this? Is it just to protect it, to promote it, to defend it, or is there some deeper purpose? The search for meaning is the task of the second half of life. (This is not always a chronological matter \u2013 I've met 11 year-old children in cancer wards who are in the second half of life, and I have met 68 year-old men like me who are still in the first half of life.)"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2216216-julie", "userReview": "\"The gift of living in our time, however, is that we are more and more discovering that the sciences, particularly physics, astrophysics, anthropology, and biology, are confirming many of the deep intuitions of religion...

Eliot in its first few pages is going to speak to me quite personally. I knew from the outset this would be a book to be taken seriously and considered thoughtfully. I guessed it might be hard work. I was not wrong.Falling Upward\u00a0is a book for those who are on a journey. Richard Rohr illustrates his thesis with the journey of Odysseus, but the journey he describes and seeks to explain is a spiritual and emotional one - and moreover a journey that, according to him, not everyone will be ready, willing or equipped to make.Rohr's central point is that we live a life of two halves, each with its own task: \"The first task is to build a strong 'container' or identity; the second is to find the contents that the container was meant to hold\". The world's focus, he says, is fixated on the first task: establishing one's identity, creating boundaries, seeking security and status, building community. That is all our society and culture seems aware of or demands of us. But it is only half the story.\"We are a 'first-half-of-life' culture,\" says Rohr, \"largely concerned about surviving successfully.\" The concerns of the first half of life are addressed by everything from sermons to self-help books to the job market. They are the concerns and drivers of the vast self-help industry described by Susan Cain in her book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, running from Dale Carnegie to Tony Robbins and beyond, which epitomises the American \"extrovert ideal\" and permeates our cultural expectations from the pre-school classroom to the Fortune 500 boardroom.\u00a0Reading Falling Upward, I became aware that even books like Cloud and Townsend's Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life, which speaks thoughtfully of a maturing of character, are still focused on the first half of life. And as Rohr states, \"not everybody goes [into the second half of life], even though all of us get older, and some of us get older than others.\" To do the first half of life rightly is essential.So what is this second half of life? It is not a comfortable place to go, but it involves moving - usually being pushed - beyond the comfort zone we have spent so much time and energy creating. After his triumphant return to Ithaca from the Trojan War, Odysseus was called to leave his island home a second time, and travel to the mainland on a second, quite different, quest. This second task in our lives, Rohr tells us, \"is more encountered than sought.\"Rohr talks about \"a gnawing desire for 'ourselves', for something more, or what I will call 'homesickness.'\" \u00a0He describes the second half of life as shadowboxing, where we are forced to synthesise the dark and light sides of our experience, and move beyond dualistic either/or thinking to a wiser and more inclusive perspective. The problem, Rohr says, is that \"our Western dualistic minds do not process paradoxes very well. Without a contemplative mind, we do not know how to hold creative tensions.\"(I have had a theory for some time that the reason we respond to music and poetry so deeply and viscerally, is that they act as carriers for emotions and ideas that are too complex, contradictory and overwhelming for us to process rationally. Rohr seems to agree: \"As good poetry does, myths make unclear and confused emotions brilliantly clear and life changing.\" The second half of life is a place of ambiguity, of myth and poetry and paradox, where we do not force ourselves to try to resolve that paradox, but our imagination and perception is somehow enlarged to accept and embrace it.)We are usually tipped into our second task by some upheaval in our lives that is too great to handle within our established comfort zone. Failure is not something that only happens to the unsuccessful or the ungodly - nor is it something to be avoided or stigmatised. \u00a0\"By denying their pain, avoiding the necessary falling, many have kept themselves from their own spiritual depths - and therefore have been kept from their own spiritual heights.\" \u00a0We have to fail and fall, says Rohr, but in doing so we find that \"the way down is the way up\".It is only those in the second half of life, he says, who are equipped to act as 'elders' in society, as spiritual and moral leaders. \u00a0From where I'm sitting, there are too few of them. \u00a0Look at the political leaders whose fixation on 'us' and 'them', on the crude labels of inclusion and exclusion, has led to the current situations in Gaza and Mosul. \u00a0Look at the religious leaders who obsess about outward conformity to rules and customs, creating a culture of checklist obedience and guilt that, at best, distracts their followers' attention from coming to know God and know themselves. (Rohr, himself a Franciscan priest, has some fairly pointed comments about the dangers of Pharisaical thinking - about \"rigid and angry old Christians\" - and says that the phenomenon \"seems to be true in all religions until and unless they lead to the actual transformation of persons\".)Look, even, at the culture of the Harvard Business School, chillingly described in Susan Cain's Quiet, which prizes assertiveness over the art of listening, and surgically removes any time for quiet individual thought and work from the schedules of its students. (Maybe this is part of the reason why Jonathan Sacks, writing in The Times\u00a0last week, said \"Thus far the 21st century has been marked by an unprecedented series of new technologies, but no new ideas\".) \u00a0The things of the second half of life are not group activities.Rohr does make it clear, though, that the second half of life is not a place of isolation. \"You can usually do this well,\" he says, \"only if you have one true mirror yourself, at least one loving, honest friend to ground you... one true mirror that reveals your inner, deepest and, yes, divine image.\" \u00a0We do not withdraw as a result of the second half of life; we are able to live relationally, and far more so than we we before.Falling Upward\u00a0was a short read but a hard one. It demands a second and third reading. \u00a0It has left me with as many questions as answers; I believe, for example, that there is a more fluid and gradual boundary between the first and second halves of life than Rohr seems to suggest. Nor does he offer any major roadsign to say \"You are now entering the second half of life\" - perhaps because there is none. He offers several passing comments that need more thought - for example, an interesting definition of eros as 'life energy', which means I will need to re-read C.S. Lewis's The Four Loves\u00a0through a different lens.\u00a0Rohr does a better and more coherent job of describing the qualities and characteristics of the second half of life, than of helping us to navigate the tumultuous life events that may lead us there. This is not a book to be read in isolation; I was left more daunted than energised by reading it, and it needs to be seasoned with others which offer encouragement for the journey.\u00a0But it makes more sense of that journey than anything else I can remember reading. And it sets out the destination in the words of two unerring poets, people I have grown to trust as companions on my own journey: Hopkins' As Kingfishers Catch Fire, quoted in the early pages of the book; and Eliot, whose Four Quartets\u00a0are the poetic counterpoise to Rohr's challenging thesis:We shall not cease from explorationAnd the end of our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time."}], "description": "A fresh way of thinking about spirituality that grows throughout life In Falling Upward, Fr. Richard Rohr seeks to help readers understand the tasks of the two halves of life and to show them that those who have fallen, failed, or \"gone down\" are the only ones who understand \"up.\" Most of us tend to think of the second half of life as largely about getting old, dealing with health issues, and letting go of life, but the whole thesis of this book is exactly the opposite. What looks like falling down can largely be experienced as \"falling upward.\" In fact, it is not a loss but somehow actually a gain, as we have all seen with elders who have come to their fullness.Explains why the second half of life can and should be full of spiritual richness Offers a new view of how spiritual growth happens?loss is gain Richard.
