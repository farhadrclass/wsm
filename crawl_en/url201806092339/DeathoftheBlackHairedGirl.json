Professor Steven Brookman is a handsome, Hemingway-masculine, intelligent, and careless instructor. Of course, we know what this means. It's not long before office hours become after hours, and the classroom becomes the bedroom. In terms of plot, there's nothing new or shocking in Death of the Black-Haired Girl. Professor Brookman is, of course, a very married man who, despite his occasional sexual liaison, is very much in love with his wife, who has recently discovered she is pregnant with their second child. Taking a personal vow to be a better husband and a better father, Brookman decides to end his relationship with Maud, but hell hath no fury like an undergraduate scorned. It's not long before Maud spirals out of control, leading to her eventual death under questionable circumstances in front of the Brookman home. Despite seeming like the setup for a by-the-numbers whodunit, Death of the Black-Haired Girl is anything but. For those familiar with Stone's writing, this shouldn't be a shock and many of the negative reviews I've read come from readers who felt misled. I can't say that I blame them. With a title that conjures The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and blurbs and summaries that throw around words like \"thriller\" and \"noir,\" it does seem to project the wrong image. However, I read and enjoyed Stone's Dog Soldiers, so I was eager to enter into Stone's morally-nebulous universe. That enthusiasm did not last very long.Stone uses the aftermath of Maud's death to explore morality in both specific and broad terms. The novel's setting is a prestigious liberal arts college in New England, an academic institution whose motto, Lux in Umbras Procedet, or Light Will Go Forth Into Shadows, hearkens to a vainglorious past, its original mission to bring civilization and God's light to the wilderness. Ironically, in its 21st century manifestation, it has become the place that creates shadows, a place of locks and barriers--no longer seeking to interact with the world, it seems to insulate itself from it. In its attempt to protect itself from outside influence, it's evident that its insular nature is destroying it from within. It is a gray, dismal wasteland populated by the selfish and the insane. As Maud quotes Mephistopheles from Doctor Faustus as saying of the world, \"Why this is hell . . . nor am I out of it\" (15). After Maud writes a scathing indictment (although, from my perspective, a clumsy, rambling and ridiculously written diatribe that I cannot imagine anyone finding persuasive or brilliant) of the hypocrisy of Christian right-to-lifers that is published in the school newspaper, the college becomes a literal battleground between the secular and the sacred as hundreds of protesters flock to the campus and some go so far as to physically threaten Maud.Many of the characters here seem to be in hell: Maud; her father, Eddie; the school counselor, Jo Carr; and Steve Brookman carry and create their own personal demons. There are also lesser angels presented in the form of the dean's wife, Mary Pick, whose tragic past in Ireland seems to have only strengthened her faith, and Ellie Brookman, who routinely leaves the college to return to the Garden-like existence offered by her Mennonite community in Canada. A woman of deep faith who believes her life to be firmly in the hands of God, Ellie serves as the embodiment of the platonic ideal for Brookman: a constant presence reminding him to do better and be better in light of his past. Discovering her pregnancy months after leaving their home to return to the fold of her family seems to remove her from the sordid sexual escapades at the college, making her pregnancy seem almost immaculate and her presence in Brookman's life divine. So, yes, there's a lot going on here in terms of spirituality, repeatedly dancing at the edge of existential angst and then pulling back again. There's a lot going on in terms of abortion, Christian fundamentalism/radicalism, adultery, marriage, and temptation. There's some beautiful writing (the scene depicting the reaction of Maud's father, Eddie, after he learns of her death is heart-wrenching). So what's the problem? Remember how I said Maud's editorial rant was rambling and clumsy? Ultimately, that's how I felt about the structure of the novel. The story isn't really about Maud's death at all, but splinters off into a dozen different directions, following secondary characters in such a hurried, abrupt way that the reader never finds resolution on any front. It's like Maud's death is a bare Christmas tree from which Stone hangs every vituperative, cynical, and nihilistic bauble he can find. But then he stands back and thinks something is missing. So out come the garlands of devotion and piety as a counterweight. But still, it's not quite right. Maybe some twinkling obvious symbolism lights? The plot becomes so weighted under these conflicting and ponderous messages that I just lost interest. But the real death knell? The host of unlikable characters. Now, don't get me wrong--I'm not suggesting they should be likable in the sense that they should be good (in fact, it is the intended saints in the novel that I find particularly obnoxious), but there should be something about them that I still find appealing. Not so here. Part of my complaint comes from the fact that the novel does far more telling than showing, so many of the characters seem two-dimensional. It doesn't help that these are self-centered, pretentious, beautiful people who are careless with the lives of others. Surprisingly, the only sympathetic character is the one I thought I would loathe the most: Steve Brookman. Despite everything, there's the sense that he did love Maud in some way that went beyond lust. He doesn't come across as a lecherous Humbert Humbert in that what he loved and celebrated in Maud had as much to do with her intellect and her potential as her youth and beauty. In the end, I can only state that Death of the Dark-Haired Girl ultimately seems tedious and unnecessary despite its grander aspirations.

And I could should just leave it at that, because that's true and it's hardly worth wasting type on a mistake of a novel. BUT HOLY SHIT WHAT A MISTAKE.This book got two stars from me BECAUSE IT WAS SO ABSURD AND BORDERLINE OFFENSIVE IT WAS LIKE A PAGETURNER OF ABSURD AND BORDERLINE OFFENSIVE. I couldn't stop reading it. It was a total trainwreck. If you like outdated insulting ethnic stereotypes, gorgeous women powerless to the charms of shitty men, beautiful saintlike wives devoted to their terrible husbands, outdated insulting religious stereotypes, outdated insulting regional stereotypes, insulting authorial attitudes to the mentally ill, casual racism, hilariously outdated language and behavior by \"young people,\" a complete lack of understanding of how technology works, outdated notions of class, a complete lack of understanding of how a contemporary college operates, bizarro dumb-dumb machismo seemingly played as \"noble,\" and much, much more. I mean, I don't demand realism from my fiction, in fact, I love wingnut shit that flies way out of bounds. But this book seems to think it is realism. And to give you one example of just how off-base that is, there are a lot of ways you might describe a heroine that is purportedly six feet tall and weighs 120 pounds but \"well-nourished and athletic?\" For real? Robert Stone, have you ever met a women in real life? In the meantime, there are all these strange details that are so wackado, that I can't tell if Stone is just playing everyone and that, in fact, he intends this book to be a comedy. Take for example, the elaborate scene setting about vast mentally ill homeless population haunting the edges of his fictionalized liberal arts Ivy-lite so pervade the story for the first few pages that even the students live in renovated flophouses. That's an interesting detail that gets dropped entirely. Likewise spectral Andean flute players, a (ghost? zombie? who the fuck knows?) new age, terrorist priest, a one night stand with a (Polish?) fake Wall Street executive with cheap Scotch, a baby-faced Irish mob family that still \"whacks\" people and seems to have been lifted full cloth from a comic book, some Canadian German Amish-lite sect who believes in standing by your man and Native American folklore and the Appalachian,former Christian rocker, schizophrenic ex-husband of the heroine's b-movie starlet roommate (I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP). And I have so many questions: Why does the protagonist dress in drag to walk to a coffeeshop in the morning? Why do people think that she's a good writer (because the extracted bits are beyond nonsensical)? Who in their right mind actually reads the editorials in a campus newspaper at a small, liberal arts college? Actually, you know what? Let me answer that last one for you: nobody. Nobody at all outside the campus, except the (maybe) parents of the students writing the editorials. I'd like to raise a broader point here, and it's not entirely fair to Mr. Stone (who really has written some great books. Seriously. Damascus Gate? A Flag For Sunrise? A Hall of Mirrors? All good. In fact, Dog Soldiers is still probably my favorite book written about the Vietnam War) that I leave this here, but it has to be said:Male authors in late middle age (or actual senescence as the case may be): we get it. You want to have sex with hot nineteen year olds. You want to believe they will become obsessed with your brilliant fiction and manly ways and swoon and sigh and keen like some tragic Gothic heroine. You want to believe you have the power to break their heart and break them. You want to believe that even though you haven't hung out with teenagers since 1965, you're still hip to the lingo. That your inherent coolness will allow you to write incisively about the lives of young people in general, and young women in particular, with razor sharp insights. And listen to me, unless you are (maybe) Thomas Pynchon (who is evidently still partying incognito with real, truly, live kids and listening to what they actually have to say), YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS. You are making an ass of yourself. You are insulting your readers. Just stop. If you want to write a campus novel (and I'd ask you to reconsider whether we really need another one of those, because GOD HELP ME, THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM), how about 1) setting it during a time you were actually on a young person on a campus and 2) making it not about an beautiful ingenue having an affair with a Hemingway-esque lit/creative writing professor and/or getting torn apart by campus politics. You have the power to make it stop. So MAKE IT STOP. Rant concluded. Seriously, people, this book is so absolutely terrible, I almost want to recommend it to you."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "Rating = 3.5 stars\"How learned and fine we believed ourselves to be!

But the guy's always married, with a kid or two and a career to protect. Relationship ends. Girl is left bereft by father figure.

Do any of us get what we have coming to us, according to our measure of responsibility for good and bad events? My guess would have to be that Bob Stone says no. Some play and others pay. This novel is more philosophical than the plot description might lead you to believe. Robert Stone stirs up a lot of serious questions without ever giving away his own stance on any of them. Is consenting adult sex between student and professor acceptable? How much responsibility does the professor bear for the consequences of such a relationship? Who has the higher moral ground on questions of abortion? At what point should confidentiality be breached to save someone from self-destructive behavior? What part, if any, should religion play in determining appropriate decisions and punishments?All of these questions are raised, and left unanswered, in this story.

(Well that, plus his wife is pregnant (again) after many years of trying.) However, we\u2019re first introduced to college student Maud and her moderately successful actress roommate (and fellow student) Shelby. And then there\u2019s Shelby\u2019s ex husband who is supposedly incarcerated in a mental institution in her hometown; and Jo, a former nun and now college counsellor.By the time tragedy strikes we\u2019ve also met Maud\u2019s father Ed \u2013 former cop and alcoholic with whom she has a complicated relationship. Because I actually thought this novel was going to be focused on Brookman, his family and the fallout of his dalliance, I found myself disappointed when we jumped between the heads of a myriad of characters and exploring a range of issues. In addition to the moral matters of adultery and abortion, religion and the church were also offered as fodder for consideration. Author Robert Stone is an acclaimed writer, but in my humble opinion, Death of the Black-Haired Girl was a huge anti-climax. Perhaps it\u2019s more of a study of human nature than anything else, although I felt our major players\u2019 reaction to the novel\u2019s tragic turning point, could have been explored in greater detail. At that point it felt like the novel became about Jo and Ed, with the Brookmans all-but disappearing. Because it felt like we were constantly moving from one character\u2019s head to another, I didn\u2019t really connect with any of the main players; and the control freak in me still struggles to define or even describe the novel in any detail.

When it happened, she had been standing outside with her college professor ex-lover in an angry confrontation. There were many witnesses, and opposing points of view about how she died, why she died, and who killed her. Additionally, there are characters either central or peripheral to Maud's life that provoke the reader into asking questions about truth and illusion; religious rearing; the connections and responsibilities of our patrons and protectors; and the security of our civic structure.Maud, who has an increasing problem with alcohol, had just posted an article in the college Gazette, railing on the anti-abortion fetishists who have placed grizzly pictures of dead fetuses on protest posters to shove in the faces of women on their way to abortion clinics. Maud, angry with the vigilantes, decides to turn it around, by publishing pictures of fetuses with birth defects, with the argument that two can play this game of propaganda.Did Maud's death come as a result of this article? If not directly, then indirectly? Or was it related to the affair with the married professor? Or did she bring it on herself, with her increasingly outrageous and self-destructive behaviors? The truth is hidden in plain sight.There are several other characters that have relationships with Maud. There's her actress roommate, Shelby, who has a schizophrenic, stalking ex-husband who is obsessed with a punitive Christian dogma. Maud's one-time counselor, Jo Carr, is a compassionate ex-nun, who also works at the hospital and believes in a woman's right to choose. Jo is certain that she has seen a menacing preacher from her younger years in South America, one who may have come to pursue and shadow Maud. Then there is Maud's father, a former detective with the NYPD, slowly deteriorating from emphysema, due to exposure to Ground Zero. He also harbors secrets that trouble him, and he worries that he may have Maud's blood on his hands.There are also characters that represent the class division of the city. This appears to be a crumbling Massachusetts mill town. Apart from the scholars and students at the college, it is a depressed place. Most of the inhabitants are meagerly educated malingerers and blue-collar workers, some who hold the esteemed college in contempt. There is also a strong presence of mental health patients who stroll in clusters of support for each other, very near the college grounds. For the most part, there is a hospitable understanding or informal agreement between the haves and the have-nots. Or is there?The plot is less important than the themes, but it is the plot, or the unanswered questions, that keeps the reader reading. Stone writes sparingly, similar in some ways to DeLillo, examining academia and exploring themes of intellectualism, piousness, and the fractures of the family. Most of the characters live in internal disenfranchisement, in a desperate isolation from each other. Stone explores the woefully and ruefully marginalized, and his prose enhances that feeling--the hollow and bleak existence of those that fail to connect, and a mournful dependence of doctrine that breeds exile, and chains them to their transgressions. And he tinges it with dark humor and irony.\"People's religion -- it's not like opium. It don't work that way. It's their mother, you understand. They may not understand their mother at all. They may hate their mother. Maybe they're ashamed of their mother. Sometimes a mother makes someone hate other people. Any thing can drive such people to anything.\"Stone's new novel is not straightforward mystery or police procedural. He is a former National Book Award winner, known for his stylized narration. The detached tone required some adjustment on my part, and I never felt an emotional attachment while reading. What lingers is the impressionistic images of a complex moral universe that Stone creates through his prose, and that evolve into a composition of exile, dependence, and internment."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "Is the universe indifferent to our suffering? Do those who believe they hold all the answers always think they have the right to hurt those who don\u2019t believe them? These two broad questions are at the core of Robert Stone\u2019s latest novel.The eponymous black-haired girl is Maud Stack \u2013 beautiful, mercurial, spoiled, and self-destructive. While attending college in New England, she begins an affair with her middle-aged and emotionally damaged college advisor, Steven Brookman. To prove her mettle, Maud writes a highly inflammatory college newspaper article tackling the faith-filled anti-abortion protestors at the most visceral level. There is no doubt what happens to Maud; the very title of the book gives the main plot point away.But is the book truly about the death of the black-haired girl\u2026or is it a book about the death of all our illusions? In the most important ways, this book is not about Maud at all and it\u2019s certainly not any kind of classic whodunit. We meet the people who hang on the periphery of Maud\u2019s life: Jo Carr, school counselor and ex-nun, who is still mentally tortured from horrors in South America, her father, Eddie Stack, an emphysema-ridden former policeman who lives with his own nightmares, her friend and roommate Shell, an actress with a mentally disturbed ex-husband, Lieutenant Salmone\u2014her father\u2019s ex-partner and many more.All of them struggle to make their lives \u2013 and Maud\u2019s death \u2013 make sense and mean something at a time when the institutions that are supposed to protect them (the churches, the law, the colleges) are failing. All of them strive for a sense of connection yet most must carry on alone.It\u2019s a strong premise, but it didn\u2019t entirely work for this reader. To buy into any of this means that the reader must first buy into the premise of Maud and Brookman and how her death unravels those around her. But her character not nuanced enough. As portrayed, Maud appeared as an unstable, potentially alcoholic, terribly entitled and na\u00efve young woman; her smartness, creativity and beauty seemed secondary to that. Some of the scenes between Maud and Steven did not seem quite genuine.Also, at times, I felt that Robert Stone was walking a thin line between serious literary work and crime novel territory. Both are valid genres, but for me, the cohesion between the two had to be more seamless.I wanted to give this a 4 star rating for many reasons: the assuredness of the prose, the universal questions it raises, and the simple fact that once I got going, I didn\u2019t want to stop reading. But it never really coalesced, hence my 3-star rating."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "2.5 stars While browsing in the library I picked this book up because - from the title - I thought it was a mystery. Though there's a death in the story it's not a mystery as such, with detectives following clues, etc. It's more of a literary novel.The basic story: Maud Stack is a beautiful, bright co-ed at a prestigious New England college. She drinks too much, is having an affair with her professor/advisor Steve Brookman, and writes for the college newspaper, 'The Gazette'. Local anti-abortion protestors inspire Maud to write a scathing editorial supporting women's rights. The editorial describes non-aborted babies with serious birth defects and/or lethal syndromes - with distressing photos when the article goes online. Before it's published Maud drops the article off at Brookman's office, hoping to impress him with her writing.As it happens Brookman has just learned that his wife is pregnant with their much-desired second child and has decided to break up with Maud. Thus, he doesn't read her article, avoids her phone calls, and doesn't respond to her text messages. Without Brookman to deter her, Maud's article is published. It garners enormous fury and blowback from the anti-abortion community, especially religious Catholics. (This part is hard to buy into. Surely the editor of 'The Gazette' would nix publication of such an inflammatory piece.)Maud, very much in love with Brookman, is devastated by the break up. She shows up drunk outside his house one blizzardy evening and throws snow at the windows, screams at him, yells things about his wife, and so on. Brookman, wanting to protect his family, goes out to confront Maud - hoping to convince her to go home. Maud attacks Brookman, punching and hitting. Brookman tries to restrain the girl, and during the struggle a car hits Maud and she's killed. Detectives investigate the incident. Did an anti-abortion protestor hit Maud? Did Brookman push her in front of the car? Was it a random accident? Was it the religious, stalkerish, estranged husband of Maud's roommate? Various 'witnesses' provide conflicting accounts of what happened and it's hard to decipher the truth.As it happens Maud's father, Ed Stack, was once a New York City police detective who was at the Twin Towers on 9/11. Stack got emphysema from the dust, became disabled, and retired. Stack loves his daughter, is devastated by her death, and is determined to get retribution. Stack also feels guilty for 'abetting' thefts from dead victims of 9/11, and speculates that God might be punishing him by taking his child. (It's pretty horrifying to think that cops would steal from disaster victims but who knows if this is true or not). Though some of this sounds like the stuff of mystery, the story doesn't really slant that way. It's more about a teacher/student affair, abortion/pro-choice issues, religion, a former nun who's now a student counselor, a militant priest who once worked in South America, a mentally ill man wandering around campus, Ed Stack's possible revenge, how Brookman's wife and co-wokrers react to the scandal, and more. In the end we do find out who killed Maud but this isn't the important part of the story.The book has interesting characters and situations but I found it hard to remain engaged in the tale, which seems to wander all over the place. Thus, in the end, I didn't like the book much."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1254714-steve", "userReview": "Not good. Stone, a writer I really admire, is now at the point in his career where he's sadly cannibalizing parts and characters from previous novels (in particular Flag for Sunrise and Bay of Souls) in order to crank out something \"new.\" Some (the New York Times) are calling this a fast paced \"literary thriller.\" Well, it is true that there are elements of both literary fiction and noirish thriller (none of which are \"fast\") in the novel, but not enough to satisfy the lover of literary fiction or genre novels. There are some cool moments throughout, but too often characters and motivation seem undercooked. There's an interesting and recent piece on Stone by the Wall Street Journal. In it Stone confesses to being both a perfectionist -- and lazy. A bad combination according to Stone. I think that harsh, but he's not exactly a prolific author, though much of what he's written is extremely well crafted, recalling high-end Hemingway and Conrad. In Death of the Black-Haired Girl, you will find numerous passages, stunning sentences, and terrific meditations on the nature of good and evil. But the parts don't equal a satisfying whole. If you're coming to this novel as a first time reader of Stone, and are mystified about his reputation after reading it, I suggest you turn to the novels Dog Soldiers and Flag For Sunrise, or perhaps his remarkable (and grim) short story, \"Under the Pitons.\" In these stories you will see why Stone has such devoted fans.

There were what in movies are called continuity errors - a college counselor is paid enough to dress well, but her office is In a basement because her status is so (aptly) low. This character, a former nun, had a rough draft of a back story that was literally pointless to the book, the plot, such as it was, and had me flipping back thru the book at one point to see if it was missing pages. She had been in another country. There was a mysterious revolutionary? Man, anyway, known as The Mourner. I think his name was symbolic. The adulterous college professor was not even developed enough to be a cliche, although much detail was provided about the drapes in his office; his wife, apparently an idiot, had some thinly sketched out religious background that she maintained - Mennonite? which contributed nothing to the barely existent plot, except more of the \"toss some themes in the blender\" -- to confuse the reader?An alcoholic cop, references to 9/11, corruption in the NYPD, abortion rights, the Catholic Church, oh, wait -- a woman widowed by an IRA bombing? College students with iPhones proving to be poor witnesses...ripped from the headlines and then tossed in a blender. Or to keep current, juicer. I finished it at last. And it was not a long book.

Being only a few years older than Maud, I can clearly remember my college years and I can absolutely guarantee that my friends and I never spoke like that. 2- Related, partially due to the language, I kept feeling like this book took place in the 70s or 80s, only to have the author specifically reference the year as 2004. The dialogue, the clothes that the characters are described as wearing- everything screams of decades past. I want to open my book to describe specific examples, but I also can't imagine opening that book again.3- The attitudes towards abortion again feel out of place in a liberal arts college in New England in 2004. Considering the absolute uproar that Maud's (poorly written) article (in a college paper, that apparently EVERYONE read) induces, this again made me feel like I was reading a book set a few decades ago. In such a setting, the fact that people were literally travelling to this college to harass a college student seemed ridiculous. 4- The fact that literally everyone can find something in this book to be offended by. Again, I don't want to go back through this book, but off the top of my head: the casual attitudes towards the mentally ill just wandering through the college, the indifference towards the town's supposedly huge homeless population (only mentioned on a surface level, as they only served to hit on Maud as she walked by), Brookman's attitudes towards his wife's religious sect in Alberta, the absolute dismissal of the roommate's mentally ill, abusive husband and the lack of concern of those around her concerning his violations of the restraining order...and I can still go on.5- The misleading title/blurb on the back of the book: don't be fooled in to thinking this is about a student who dies shrouded in mystery, or think that her affair with her married professor will make this any sort of a suspense novel. There were so many random plots inserted, and at some point I just stopped caring. I got this book for maybe $3 in the cheap bins at the book store and I can't even recommend buying it then. Judging by other reviews, it seems that this author has other, far worthier novels that someone looking to read this book should probably choose instead."}, {"userName": "Megan Folse", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30206073-megan-folse", "userReview": "I was going to write this review later, but I can't sleep. The longer I think about this book, the more I hate it. What gets under my skin, more than the book itself, are the reviews oozing praise for this book from some of the major newspapers. Then I check GoodReads and see that many other readers agree with me. Thank god!My first hint that this book would not make it onto my favorites list was when the lovely Maud gave dear professor a blowjob. It was like a scene from a cheesy porno; all that was missing was the plaid skirt. \"I bet a man wrote this.\" Hey, look! I was right!Except for the professor, the characters were lifeless shells. Maud, who was supposed to be intelligent, was an absolute pinhead. The counselor was flat as a pancake-very little dimension. Even Maud's grieving father toed the line between real and a robot.I understand what Stone was trying to accomplish with the religious references, the highlighting of hypocrisy directly and indirectly, the edges between where sin begins and ends, and everything else. At least, I think I do. He never quite reaches his goal, whatever it is, and instead splinters the story in a dozen directions. Each direction ends in a pointless mess, and the book closes with a weak attempt to bring it all together."}, {"userName": "Pauline Viskup", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15403283-pauline-viskup", "userReview": "Read this for my book club.

In the end the book is not merely about the death of the black haired girl, a college student who wades into the abortion issue. The book is ultimately about how we as individuals choose what has meaning for us and whether ultimately that choice is meaningful at all. On a micro level the book seems to suggest that very little of what we believe or hope for has much affect on our fellow beings. However, it is more about the striving for meaning that is more important than anything else. This issue is played out through the question of abortion. Maud Stack, (the black haired girl) writes an article in her college paper about the despicable conduct of anti-abortion zealots. She is particularly galled by the photos protesters use to scare women away from getting abortions. Thus, she finds photographs of horribly deformed children who were born and suggests that God does a pretty good job of aborting children as well. (Some of the live births only last for a few minutes or hours.) This of course agitates the anti-abortion crowd. There are several candidates the police could look at for the crime. But there are characters in this book with varying degrees of religious morality and it dawns on the reader that there is indeed a lot of gray area in this debate no matter how strongly you might feel about one side or the other. As with most other major issues, the movement appears much different when one focuses on or has a relationship with individuals. Movements seem to create an inertia of there own that simply may be too big for individual actors, who are nonetheless cogs in the machinery. If they want to be a part of the movement, they are part of the machine. It becomes very difficult to have a meaningful dialogue under these circumstances. The police search for the usual suspects until the crime is solve. But is not how the crime is solved that is the focal point of this book. Rather the book ask us to question why we do what we do and whether there is ultimately in meaning in our daily lives at all."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1937720-simon", "userReview": "1.5 stars.... Stone's final novel is a busy mess of a book, one that never pauses to develop the character at its center. College student Maud Stack is by turns an alcoholic, a firebrand writer for the campus newspaper, and the lover of a professor. It's Maud's death that sets the story in motion, but Stone is only interested in her as a set of behaviors that cause reactions in others. The world Robert Stone sets this novel is resolutely depressing, and Stone doesn't hesitate to pile on. Recently released mental patients roam the streets near Maud's campus alongside angry pro-life marchers, and it's a rant about the marchers (one that no newspaper, college or otherwise, WOULD EVER PRINT) that provides the most likely reason for Maud's death. There's also a mention of the robbing of dead bodies at Ground Zero and counselor whose work with radicals in Mexico Stone uses for digressions that add nothing. In the end there's a meeting between two men central to Maud's life, and we realize Stone's point. Robert Stone, for all his facility as a writer, was incapable of putting himself inside the head of a young woman c. 2015. What we have here is a novel about the Sadness of Men.

Robert Stone. ***.I admire Stone\u2019s writing skills, but this, his latest novel, left me cold. Although well written, I\u2019m not sure what it was about. The plot is straight-forward: A young college professor has an affair with one of his students; unfortunately, he is married with one child and another on the way, and he has to break the relationship up. The student doesn\u2019t want that to happen and threatens to break up his marriage in a forceful way.

The effect of this on her father, the professor, the professor\u2019s wife, and a counselor at the school is fully explored. To add to this, the student had just written a screed against the anti-abortionists who had been demonstrating on campus.

I don't think that's a spoiler, seeing that it's in the title that she's going to die.

And you can't help but like her, not because she is a kind and sweet person, but because of her edges and because she wants what everyone wants out of life.Definitely an interesting read. It was especially harsh to read about her father, who was a policeman there on 9-11 and doesn't expect anything for all the crap that got in his lungs. He doesn't even bother to go to the doctor; he's just pretty much given up.This is one of those books where every character has a deep background, and it was great to read about her roommate and her husband issues as well as the counselor and her history with other girls and before she came to the school."}, {"userName": "John Pappas", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5899347-john-pappas", "userReview": "While it would be reductive to see Stone's latest novel as simply a post-9/11 allegory, the campus Stone describes is a petri dish for a study in the tensions between passion and responsibility, and the consequences ofliving without limits to one's personal power. He limns the edges of freedom and security in personal and political ways (vis a vis his particular brand of conflicted Catholicism and justice), but never hides behind false-seeming allegory. Fast-paced and multi-faceted, Stone's narrative investigates the complex moral universe his characters inhabit with all of the accompanying rationalizations and justifications that go along with their passions. Despite the complexity of characterization, messy, unresolved strands of narrative spin out from the center of the narrative and do not addmuch to the thematic content or forward motion of the plot.

My first Robert Stone novel, and won't be my last. The titular event occurs about halfway through the novel, and it does suck a little life out of things.

This seems to be billed as a thriller or a sort of genre novel in certain places, but aside from some serious exposition (esp. in character introductions), it reads like pure high lit. Some really great moral questions handled here, most of it woven into the story brilliantly, some of it just straight-up explicit.
