The Turks suspect a terrorist plot \u2013 Arthur\u2019s job is to carry on as normal, find out and report back.But \u2013 as you might guess, Arthur is not good at this \u2013 and in due course is enlisted into the gang following an injury to one of its members; Arthur is to replace him on the night of the illicit deed.In constant fear of being unmasked, and of not delivering for his handlers, Arthur bumbles brilliantly. To follow his progress is excruciating, but eminently plausible.I thought, another very good read from Mr Ambler."}, {"userName": "Alessia Scurati", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41122741-alessia-scurati", "userReview": "( questa parte potete anche saltarla) Storia in italiano \u00e8 anche sinonimo di relazione. Ecco: io a volte ho delle storie con libri, alcune delle nascono proprio dal momento in cui il mio sguardo si posa sulla copertina. Il primo incontro \u00e8 stato cos\u00ec: io che faccio una sosta nei sotterranei dell\u2019impero del Male (la Feltrinelli Duomo) e mi imbatto nella nuova edizione Adelphi del romanzo, ben disposta in pi\u00f9 esemplari nella colonna \u2018Novit\u00e0\u2019. A quel punto ho capito che il romanzo mi sarebbe piaciuto. Perch\u00e9 c\u2019erano Peter e Melina sulla prima. Io nutro profonda ammirazione sia per Peter Ustinov che per Melina Merkouri (nota: gli Elgin Marbles sono stati rubati, dovrebbero essere restituiti e io, sapendo che ci\u00f2 non accadr\u00e0, mi sono sempre rifiutata e sempre mi rifiuter\u00f2 di visitare il British Museum. Amen). Qualche mese dopo ho acquistato e letto. A questo punto forse dovrei anticipare anche che, come altri, avevo visto pi\u00f9 di una volta il film prima di leggere il romanzo - di solito lo evito, ma coi film di una certa et\u00e0 \u00e8 quasi impossibile. C\u2019\u00e8 qualcuno che prima di aver visto Via col vento ha letto il romanzo? Vengo e lo abbraccio, nel caso. A dir la verit\u00e0, le differenze tra la trasposizione cinematografica di Dassin e il romanzo sono marcate. Per cui, non d\u00e0 fastidio nella lettura l\u2019aver visto il film prima. Anzi, le ho trovate proprio due esperienze differenti, quindi compatibili. L\u2019unica cosa che noterei \u00e8 che non vedevo la necessit\u00e0 di cambiare il titolo al romanzo, facendolo vampirizzare dal film. Ragioni commerciali, certo, ma io faccio il tifo per The light of the day.(questa parte potete anche leggerla)Arthur Simpson \u00e8 uber alles. Non perch\u00e9 \u00e8 il narratore delle vicende. Ma perch\u00e9 vince per distacco (parecchio) sull\u2019originalit\u00e0 rispetto a tutti quanti gli altri personaggi. Arthur Abdel Simpson \u00e8 uno che nella vita si arrangia come pu\u00f2 e lo fa pi\u00f9 o meno da quando ha iniziato a respirare. Di lui, una cosa \u00e8 certa: \u00e8 sempre ospite sgradito ed elemento fuori posto in qualunque punto del globo terraqueo lo si metta. Inglese ed egiziano e greco ma anche un po\u2019 turco ma alla fine, apolide. Senza un lavoro vero che non sia dedicarsi a truffare il prossimo, meglio se un turista sprovveduto ad Atene. Solo che il signor Harper, che Simpson scambia per un turista da gabbare e che cerca di turlupinare per fregargli i travel cheques, in realt\u00e0 \u00e8 un criminale pi\u00f9 intelligente di lui e lo coinvolge in un colpo molto grosso, apparentemente al di sopra delle capacit\u00e0 del nostro.Arthur Simpson \u00e8 un eroe incompreso. La polizia turca, che lo conosce da tempo, lo usa come informatore pensando sia finito in un giro di terroristi, non apprezzando il suo sforzo per sventare il colpo del secolo. I suoi complici, Fischer e Harper per primi, lo considerano un caprone e finiscono per restarne abbastanza beffati. Lui, come al solito, alla fine si ritrover\u00e0 pi\u00f9 o meno nella stessa condizione di outsider di prima, perch\u00e9 nessuno lo vuole tra i piedi. Alla fin della fiera, il romanzo \u00e8 davvero divertente, facendo del personaggio principale la sua forza e degli sgangherati comprimari un elemento divertente in pi\u00f9. La trama \u00e8 un congegno che gira alla perfezione, per molte pagine non si capisce che cavolo stia succedendo al povero Simpson e come se ne salver\u00e0. Ambler \u00e8 uno specialista della narrazione d\u2019intrattenimento. Una lettura godibile e molto elegante, anche. Non \u00e8 un giallone da spararsi in vena in un pomeriggio, siamo a livelli di cura e raffinatezza molto elevati, qui.

I got the surprise of my life: As I was reading this book, I was astoundingly able to remember the plot structure so well that I could have written the book myself. How many books can you remember like that after such a long period of dormancy? This tells me that Ambler produced a product that was designed to remain in your memory\u2026one you were not likely to forget. Based on this experience, I have to make sure to recommend this work to all new readers out there so that they might have the same type of experience. Here\u2019s a book with a relatively straight-forward plot that features characters that come alive on the page. Based on my readings of Ambler so far, this has to be one of his top productions.

Arthur Abdel Simpson was such a man, although he was more anti-hero than hero, because he was quite simply a small-time crook. In _The Light of Day_ he stumbles into--or rather is blackmailed into--what he at first suspects is some kind of smuggling operation. Then he has the misfortune to be apprehended by Turkish Army intelligence and he fears he may unknowingly become involved in a coup attempt. How he deals with these successive situations and keeps his skin whole is the subject of the book. _The Light of Day_ is also a very droll look at British public schools, British attitudes, c. the early 1960s towards foreigners, and many other subjects. Commenting on police procedures, the narrator Simpson observes that he could hardly be considered an expert on the subject because he had only been arrested 10 or 12 times in his career. It would be going too far to label this book a comedy of manners, but it definitely contains some of those elements. _The Light of Day_ later served as the basis for the movie\"Topkapi.\""}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david", "userReview": "This is what your grandma thought was good airplane reading, and she had better taste than you.

He really comes to life and seems like he could be like any person passing you on the street.

Turkish wrestling, involving large groups of men, oiling their bodies ostentatiously, grabbing each other, putting hands in each other\u2019s pants ( why?), pulling, pushing and at the long waited end, kissing each other\u2026not on the lips.Elizabeth Lipp aka the heroine aka Melina Mercouri loves this show and insists on it in front of the police, even if it seems to be, if not in bad taste, at least of dubious relevance for a woman to see these rudimentary looking men fighting each other, but on the other hand, men enjoy it so much they do not want to abandon their places in the arena \u2013 which is overcrowded- for any reason.The Turkish secret police is following the moves of the group of criminals at the center of the plot, but the agents who need to tail them would not budge, inviting each other at one point, from the resplendent spectacle \u2013 hardly that- of the wrestling show.Elizabeth Lipp plans the theft of an extremely precious piece of jewelry, a dagger with exquisite precious stones that had belonged to a sultan, which now resides in the palace of Topkapi.Her accomplices are Walter Harper aka Maximilian Schell- a wondrous, noble and charming presence- Cedric Page aka the excellent Robert Morley, the aforementioned Arthur Simon and they all have a contribution to play and will be essential in the convoluted, a little too complicated plan.As already stated, the Turkish authorities are aware of their presence and in their cunning and deviousness, the criminals have decided to put the police on the wrong track, giving them reason to believe that an armed attack might take place, although they are interested in making a profit, not killing anyone.In a way, the presentation of the agents serves some purpose, it is amusing somewhat and may make one think of their ridiculousness in the present day, when under the Supreme guidance of the Modern sultan, Erdogan, the authorities have placed in jail the largest number of journalists in the free world, they abuse their power and do preposterous things.They even investigate Netflix for a supposed political message in a trailer they aired, someone is also suspected of having tried telekinesis to inflict injury upon the Beloved Sultan Erdogan and other hilarious, if they were not serious and tragic, stupid acts.To get their hands on the coveted dagger, the thieves concoct a strategy that is not on a par with Ocean\u2019s Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, but it was surely innovative for the time- the film was released fifty four years ago- and it involves the con man Arthur Simon- Peter Ustinov is by far the most rewarding presence in the film- an athlete who can bypass the rudimentary security system and more.Somehow, this can make one think of sports and what they used to look like then and the stunning speed in the field today: with the opening of the Russia Soccer World Cup in the next few weeks, some documentaries on the history of the tournaments have been aired.Players have done their best in the past, many had tremendous skills, but the pace of the game is nothing like the slow, easy going in perspective dance of the days gone by and in the same manner, watching Ocean\u2019s Eleven makes one think of adjusting the play speed for Topkapi.If many classics, masterpieces of the Golden Age of Cinema make the audiences regret those days, for dramas like Casablanca, comedies like Some Like It Hot have stood the test of time and we do not have works that surpass those, looking at features like Topkapi would make viewers feel so much better about the \u2013 very good, not the redundant \u2013 thrillers of today.If one reads the taglines created for the motion picture, one can laugh, although the comedy itself is not so amusing, in spite of the commendable efforts of the cast, which is great, with the notable exception \u2013 in the view of the under signed- of Melina Mercouri: \u201cIt's for Thursday, darling, in Istanbul...we've got a leather vest, a surgeon's lamp, a suction cup and a boy-scout knot, also a mastermind, an electronics genius - .

Several weeks passed and by the time I picked it up and concluded it, the thrill (to paraphrase the late great B. B. King) had gone.

The second half, with its collection of various misfits planning a heist, I found overlong and the stakes not high enough. I never felt that Arthur, our hero, was in any genuine danger (most obviously because the first-person narrative guaranteed that he lived beyond the outcome of the plot) and everything was a little too languorous and divagatory to be compelling.

I can say that Peter Ustinov was a lot younger than the novel's first-person narrator, that the aim of Harper and his co-conspirators is kept much more of a secret in the novel than in the film, and that, while the two tell much the same story, they're paced very differently: the first three quarters of the book is only the first half of the film, with the last quarter of the book spread over the second half. I don't remember the ending of the movie, but that probably means it was more satisfying than the abrupt conclusion the book comes to, which was sufficiently disappointing that I'm knocking off a star.

A good decision as it proved to be hugely enjoyable, just what I was looking for at the time.The novel is narrated by Arthur Abdel Simpson, a small-time thief who makes a living by hustling tourists on their arrival at Athens airport. As the story opens, Simpson is recounting the tale of how he got mixed up with Harper, a man who turned out to be more dangerous than he appeared at first sight. As Simpson looks back on past events, here\u2019s how his story begins:It came down to this: if I had not been arrested by the Turkish police, I would have been arrested by the Greek police. I had no choice but to do as this man Harper told me. He was entirely responsible for what happened to me.I thought he was an American. He looked like an American \u2013 tall with the loose, light suit, the narrow tie and button-down collar, the smooth, old-young, young-old face and the crew cut. He spoke like an American, too; or at least like a German who had lived in America for a long time. Of course, I now know that he is not an American, but he certainly gave that impression. His luggage, for instance, was definitely American: plastic leather and imitation gold locks. I know American luggage when I see it. (pg. 1)It\u2019s a good opening, one that pulled me into narrative \u2013 you know from the start that something bad has happened to the narrator, and he holds Harper responsible for it.When Simpson spots Harper at the airport, he marks him out as someone seemingly unfamiliar with Athens, reasonably well off and thus a suitable target for one of his petty scams. He offers to act as the visitor\u2019s driver and guide to the city, and after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, Harper agrees. But unfortunately for Simpson, Harper has him all worked out from the get-go, and when Simpson tries to steal a few travellers cheques from his wallet, Harper catches him red-handed.He turned and stared at me. All at once his face was neither old-young nor young-old. It was white and pinched and his mouth worked in an odd way. I have seen faces go like that before and I braced myself. There was a metal lamp on the writing table beside me. I wondered if I could possibly hit him with it before he got to me.But he did not move. His eyes flickered towards the bedroom and then back to me. (pg. 21)Having discovered Simpson\u2019s scam, Harper blackmails him into playing a part in his own shady plan. Simpson must drive a high-class American car from Athens to Istanbul, no questions asked \u2013 it\u2019s either that or Harper will turn him over to the police. Harper, on his part, claims he is doing a favour for the daughter of a business associate, Fr\u00e4ulein Elizabeth Lipp, the car\u2019s registered owner. Even though Simpson suspects the car may be carrying illicit goods (drugs, jewellery, money or suchlike), he knows he has to go through with it. Harper has already strong-armed him into signing a confession for the purposes of \u2018insurance\u2019.To read the rest of my review, please click here:https://jacquiwine.wordpress.com/2015..."}], "description": "The Light of Day was the basis for Jules Dassin\u2019s classic film, Topkapi.When Arthur Abdel Simpson first spots Harper in the Athens airport, he recognizes him as a tourist unfamiliar with city and in need of a private driver. In other words, the perfect mark for Simpson\u2019s brand of entrepreneurship. But Harper proves to be more the spider than the fly when he catches Simpson riffling his wallet for traveler\u2019s checks. Soon Simpson finds himself blackmailed into driving a suspicious car across the Turkish border. Then, when he is caught again, this time by the police, he faces a choice: cooperate with the Turks and spy on his erstwhile colleagues or end up in one of Turkey\u2019s notorious prisons.
