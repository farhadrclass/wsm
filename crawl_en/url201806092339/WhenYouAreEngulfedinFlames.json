I can sincerely type LOL, or even ROFL, or LSHIS (laughed so hard I snorted). This is funny. Sedaris has a rare gift of relating a hilarious story or by simply telling a commonplace occurrence in a funny way. So why just three stars? In between the laughs is the not altogether likable persona of Sedaris. He may impart self deprecating humor, or maybe he is personifying a satire on our culture, or both, but many times in the narrative, organized into short essays or vignettes, I had to admit that I did not like my narrator. Other times, to be fair, he repented or showed a generous, open mindedness; but I could not shake the image of an unapologetically selfish person who, sadly, may reflect modern Western culture all too well. That said, really funny book."}, {"userName": "Dusty Myers", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/423999-dusty-myers", "userReview": "Here's my take on Sedaris, or maybe my take on Sedaris before I listened to this book:  Naked is easily his best work because it's his most thorough, his most unencumbered by his own fame. If we were to compare his oeuvre to MTV's The Real World, Naked is the original New York season (despite not being Sedaris's first book). In New York, the cast members were people already living in the city (with the Alabama exception) and trying to make a living; the whole \"be on TV\" part of it was something they dealt with in the name of free housing. Now, of course, teens run at the chance to go live in some other city just to \"have their lives taped,\" just for the fame it might bring, and what they actually do on the show is dull as a result. Naked is the masterpiece because the essays therein are longer and more satisfying; the whole thing is memoir in its finest form of sifting through the past to let someone understand how life (or maybe just a life) gets lived.Then he got wildly famous and was able to publish any old essay in any old magazine. This, I recognize, is a factor of his talent both as a writer and a humorist, not a factor of his name. Still, even as \"far back\" as  Me Talk Pretty One Day, I left much of the essays with a sense of incompletion. \"Picka Pocketoni\"? Why wasn't this narrator doing anything? It wasn't enough just to stand there and report, I felt.A lot of WYAEiF is about how wealthy and glamorous Sedaris's life is, and how wealthy he was growing up, which is something I'd never really sensed before. He talks about the cork-lined dining room at his parents' house with the (at the time) contemporary Danish modern furniture. He talks about the $20K he spent to quit smoking by moving to Tokyo for three months. He mentions an $8K first-class ticket he bought. He mentions a lot of airplane rides; I think at least three of the essays have their roots in something that happened to D.S. while flying across the Atlantic. This smacks to me of a writer who's run out of things to write about; and yet there are essays about old neighbors (\"That's Amore\", one of the collection's best), so it seems Sedaris still has enough memories to last a few more books.I heard that in some interview somewhere, Sedaris confessed that he was getting to the point in his life where he'd act in a scene explicitly for the purposes of creating something to write about. Maybe Sedaris has a history of this (I can't imagine he just wanted to up and go to a nudist colony on his own; clearly, he saw great material in the exercise) but something about the heft of those earlier essays (\"Santaland Diaries\", too) makes them seem more honest. In the interview, Sedaris was talking specifically about the decision to cough so hard on a plane that his throat lozenge would be expelled from his mouth. He thought, Let's see what happens, and coughed. This action begins one of the essays in this book, and it's never revealed as constructed.I'm not aligning myself with that camp of Memoir Exposers For The Truth. My complaint isn't that Sedaris makes things up. It's that at one time, behind the essays, was this guy David Sedaris, or as close to the guy as we could get, and now it seems that behind all these essays lies \"The Writer David Sedaris\". I'm not making myself clear.(Which, incidentally, is one thing I can't fault Sedaris for. His timing in writing is impeccable and his descriptions apt and lovely in places. Oh and funny. The book in just incredibly, unendingly funny. In short: get the audiobook.)"}, {"userName": "Majenta", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50966861-majenta", "userReview": "4 1/2 stars.\"The houses looked like something a child might draw, a row of shaky squares with triangles on top.

But that\u2019s neither here nor there.Sedaris\u2019s recent book makes such a dismissive comment truer than ever. For readers familiar with Holidays on Ice, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, and Me Talk Pretty One Day, there is little Funny and Original to enjoy from When You Are Engulfed in Flames. And especially for readers of The New Yorker like myself, where most of the essays in this publication were initially published, there is a lot to be desired.A few highlights include an explanation for why Sedaris does not believe in God: \u201cBecause I have hair on my back, and a lot of other people, people who kill and rob and make life miserable, don\u2019t. A real God wouldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d And his prediction that, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume that by 2025, guns will be sold in vending machines, but you won\u2019t be able to smoke anywhere in America.\u201d With the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling on D.C\u2019s gun ban, Sedaris\u2019s prescience is foreboding.But what I found most interesting about When You Are Engulfed in Flames was the About the Author: \u201cDavid Sedaris\u2019s half-dozen books have been translated into twenty-five languages, including Estonian, Greek, and Bahasa. His essays appear frequently in The New Yorker and are heard on Public Radio International\u2019s This American Life.\u201dIt was the first sentence that intrigued me. There\u2019s a good David Sedaris essay to be had from that line. Did David Sedaris himself write it? If not, but the editor did, why the importance on Estonian, Greek, and Bahasa and not the other 22 languages? Does translation into these three languages indicate a literary achievement of some sort? Is it a big deal for Estonians, Greeks, and Indonesians to be reading David Sedaris? While Microsoft Word\u2019s spell check wants Bahasa to be Bahamas, Bahaman, Batas, Balas, or Banana, Bahasa is in fact spelled correctly. It is the native language of Indonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation, and therefore one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. So for David Sedaris to be available in this language is no small feat. Why then Estonian and Greek? And what are the other 22 neglected languages? Why are they less special?"}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/The funniest collection by David Sedaris that I\u2019ve read so far. There just aren\u2019t words to express how happy these books make me. Sedaris is by far my favorite humorist/essayist/columnist/whatever-ist you want to call him. His writing can turn my frown upside down and always leaves me laughing like a lunatic. My infatuation actually began with another Sedaris \u2013 David\u2019s sister Amy. Anyone who looks like this:\nBut prefers to get paid for looking something like this:\nIs someone that I want to hang out with. When I discovered her brother, I found there was enough love in my heart for multiple Sedaris-es. Sadly, as much as I love dear David, it will most likely always be from afar. I have a huge phobia that if I meet a famous person I adore, they will end up being an asshat. I find myself each year sitting at the computer, hand hovering over the PayPal button, but always failing to purchase a ticket to one of his book readings/signings. Not only am I fearful David will be a jerk, but that he will also discover I\u2019m a huge nutter. Ours would be quite the ill-fated meet/cute with me screaming things like \"why won't you love me????\" while he runs away responding something along the lines of \"because I'm gay, you crazy bitch, which you should be well aware of since you've been my borderline stalker for years now!\" In addition, I would be forced to stand in line with a bunch of strangers mouthbreathing their germy breath on me \u2013 or even worse, having the gall to engage in small talk. Just UGH! My David and I may never meet, but I will continue to stalk love him and shout my praise of his hilarious books from the rooftops.Sidenote: This was my final selection for the Kansas City Public Library's Winter Reading Challenge. \"Stop Me If You've Read This One\" was the theme this year and encouraged patrons to read books that might make them laugh. By completing my 5 books, I got a lovely little coffee mug that Mitchell promptly declared as his.\nFor those curious of my funny book choices for this challenge, they are as follows:Skinny Dip by Carl HiassenIn Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks by Adam CarollaMan Up by Ross MathewsWhen You Are Engulfed In Flames by David Sedaris (duh)andAmerican Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis.

Herein are more of his usual daily-life topics: getting to know the neighbors (I.E. the local child molester), his fascination with creepy shit, the annoying people that enter his life, relationship issues (poor Hugh comes in for it in this one!), his pet spider and a mish-mash of other stuff.Sedaris is very open about his personal issues. He has some OCDs and while it's surely hell to live through, he kindly plucks out the funny bits for our amusement. The writing is getting a little bit too meta at this point for me. His daily life over the last few years, due to his own fame and fortune, has become less relatable for us commoners. Thus his material that finds him flying about the world, living in Paris and Tokyo, etc., while still humorous, does not hit the same funnybone as his past works. The regional idiosyncrasies of the travel-related pieces are good for a few laughs, but they just don't elicit the same home-grown guffaws that sprouted naturally from the stories of his middle class American family's upbringing of him and his many siblings. Still though, I've enjoyed this a couple times and would again. Rating: 3.5Recommended: For people that prefer observational humor and would rather steer clear of his highly personal anecdotes.

While earlier in his career the author seemed to go for easy laughs (Look at my brother! What an ass!) or convenient self-loathing something seems to have clicked this time around that transforms the work from magazine article quality to literature. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Sedaris sounds like a real writer in this book; the essays flow unforced and genuine insight accompanies the punch lines. Sedaris doesn't seem to be writing for performance here as much as writing for the page; that's a welcome change, in my eyes.

Not my favorite Sedaris. This one seemed to be darker and more serious than the others of his I have read (includes some artsy filler stories). There were some of the usual amusing tales - most of which in this book took place in France or on an airplane. The last 1/3 of the book (or so) was a cross between what it is like to live in Japan and being a smoker from start to finish. I don't think I would recommend that someone start here if they want to try Sedaris, but if you have read and enjoyed him before, this will be a good one to read."}, {"userName": "V.

With your boyfriend. In France. Where they speak French, because it's France. Thank you for reminding me you live in France, with your boyfriend, where they speak French, with funny French accents, and funny funny French words, with their French ways, every ten to twelve pages. Else I might have forgotten you live in . . . wait, where was it again?No, seriously, I'm glad you have an army of NPR-head fans to squirm with delight at your every little bon mot. it must be pretty gratifying. As a former fan, however, I'm a little distressed at the direction you've been moving over the last several years, especially in this volume.I understand that your legions of fans love it when you collect eccentrics like some eBay addicts collect Precious Moments figurines. It seems to me, however, that even as you celebrate the grotesque in every essay, you seem less in touch with the real, the good, and the positive. If it doesn't belong in a freak show, the material seemingly doesn't belong in your book. For example, it seems as if you have a (very patient) boyfriend who cares for you, but you show precious little evidence of returning the affection as in your essays you toss aside the flowers he buys you, mock his musical enthusiasms, and generally diminish his role in your life. You recoil with horror when a friendly cabbie offers to help you find companionship in a strange city, but you lovingly recall for several long pages the memory of looking at photos with your sister of a woman copulating with a horse. Oh, I'm all for celebrating oddities. Good for you. The mainstream gets enough attention. The fussy, grandmotherly way in which you gather them to your sides and cultivate them, however, lately borders less on comedy or insightful reporting, and more toward outright pathology. It seems a shame, as I know you're a much more capable writer than your adoring fans want you to be.--A friendP.S. We suffered for too many years with your funny French lessons.

It appeared he was now left with the task of finding hilarity and poignancy in the life of a rich, celebrated author. \"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\" confirms that his days of dressing as an elf, picking apples, and hitch-hiking cross country with an incomplete quadriplegic are long gone. In their place we are left with essays about catching flies, cantankerous car service drivers, and foul-mouthed airline passengers (two essays on this topic in fact). This would be a real problem if they weren't entertaining (most are), but they lack the quality of desperation that so fueled his earlier work. Add to that the author's note at the beginning of the book: \"The events described in these stories are realish. Certain characters have fictitious names and identifying characteristics,\" along with a recent article from The New Republic revealing him as a serial exaggerator, and I'm left with the impression that his best work is behind him. I hope he proves me wrong."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65207-shannon", "userReview": "I don't quite get the people who say this isn't as funny as his other books- I thought it was plenty funny. The comment about having a 400 dollar sweater that looked like it had been thrown to a tiger and thus was already ruined and incapable of being further ruined.. that made me laugh. And saying a cracker tasted like penis. And lots of little one-liners. But what's really awesome about his stuff is that it's MORE than just a bunch of one-liners. He really is a very observant, intelligent, hilarious writer. I think.Admittedly a few times he seemed to kind of go.. off track, and there were all these little asides that didn't seem to be related to the main theme, or whatever. So, I guess, some of the essays were a bit less cohesive than usual. But, he can pull it off. I could listen to him ramble about anything.Also I LOVE his descriptions of his relationship with Hugh. It's so awesome that he can complain so much about his partner and yet do so in a way that indicates clearly that he is deeply in love with him. It's adorable.Oh, and speaking of adorable. I listened to the audio-book version of this, too. If you haven't heard Sedaris read his work, you're missing out. He's excellent..Also: Because I'm a spaz for Chip Kidd I have to say this: he designed the cover ISN'T IT AWESOME? I think it's really apt for this book, because, besides several literal references to skeletons and smoking in this book.. I think it captures the overall mood.. there is a lot of reference to death, but it's all relatively lighthearted and humorous.. as is an image of a skeleton smoking a cigarette. Kind of awesomely dark and a bit morbid, I think."}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "The reasons that this didn't get a 1 star from me are because 1.) I didn't actively dislike anything about it, I just found it boring and 2.) David Sedaris' narration is great. Actually, his narrating is probably one of the only things I did like about this book.As an avid listener of NPR's This American Life, I have, from time to time, heard stories from David Sedaris and found them highly enjoyable. So enjoyable, in fact, that I've been driving to work almost in tears from laughter. What I expected from this collection was that. And that is not what I got. Perhaps it was my own false assumption, but these stories were neither funny, nor memorable. If I hadn't listened to the audiobook on my hour-long commute to and from work this week and instead had chosen to read the stories, I probably would've given up after the first few. But Sedaris' companionship during my drive kept me optimistic, hoping that the next story would be better than the last. In the end though, I didn't really love any of them.I will, however, check out another Sedaris audiobook because 1.) his narration really is great and 2.) I've heard much better things about his other collections."}, {"userName": "brian tanabe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/332276-brian-tanabe", "userReview": "When I first saw this in a bookstore I thought to myself, can he do it again? Is there more scrapable hilarity clinging to the walls of his interesting life, fit to amuse and entertain his many fans? Sedaris does in fact do it again and apparently there's an endless well of funny stuffy, a font of hilarity, within this man.This is another great collection, on par with his other works for all the Sedaris fans out there. There is one story in particular (\u201cThat's Amore\u201d) -- or rather a character in this story -- I would love to see him write a full length piece on. Helen is too good (or bad) to be true. As with city rats, Sedaris likens her to the \u201ctype of creature [he] expected to find living in New York.\u201d When apartment shopping in New York it was Hugh (Sedaris\u2019 partner) who runs into the 70-something year old first, \u201c[nodding] hello and as he turned to leave, she pointed to some bags lying at her feet.\u201c'Carry my groceries upstairs.' She sounded like a man, or, rather, a hit man, her voice coarse and low, like heavy footsteps on gravel.\u201c'Now?' Hugh asked.\u201cShe said, 'What?

I definitely appreciate that he's a big homo- there's a point in this book where he says that something he's eating tastes kind of like penis- who absolutely kills the Barnes & Noble circuit. Kind of like Chuck Palahniuk, except more explicit.

It would probably be more like three and a half if Goodreads did half stars the way LibraryThing does, but ah well.The observation I have for this collection is that with Mr. Sedaris giving up drinking, drugs, and smoking... his stories seem to be a bit more tame. Much more focus on his boyfriend Hugh or stories tinged with a bit of melancholy. The NY Times mentioned the story about his parents' art collection, which is perhaps one of the better crafted stories. My favorite, however, is called \"Keeping Up\" -- which talks about couples arguing on vacation and features Mr. Sedaris rehearsing his \"I'm leaving you\" speech to his boyfriend after Hugh's fast walking leaves Sedaris lost and alone in a zoo in Sydney. In general, it's nice to see Hugh making more of an appearance in Sedaris' stories. Sedaris' previous volumes have focused so much on his siblings that when you realize how long he and Hugh have been together, you're a bit surprised that it's taken Sedaris this long to mine his significant other for material. In the past, he's popped up every now and then, but he's a much more substantial figure in this collection. As with Sedaris' other works, though, one can't help but wonder how his friends and relatives deal with having details of their lives published and sold. Unlike his parents and sisters, though, Sedaris consistently paints Hugh in a good light and one can't help but wonder how Sedaris can function without Hugh at times in this collection.In any case, while you might want to wait to purchase a paperback version, this collection does have several good chuckles.

Maybe they get used to his style of humour. Maybe there's a golden order in which to read them (personally, I find chronologically by publishing date works well). Maybe there is a slight advantage to hearing him speak in person. I tend to read him while imagining how he'd say it, and immediately a dry sentence comes to life.I could go on about the maturation I see happening in his work, but I won't. Not for now.What I will say is that in his past work, he seems to be a sort of bystander in many of his stories. Things happen around him. He observes. Takes notes. Then turns them into stories. But rarely is he at the center of the story - the obvious exception being \"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\"This book is different. This is a collection of mostly unrelated stories, and his presence in all of them is more noticeable. More nostalgia, and a dark softness pervades these stories.

Don't get me wrong - he's still funny - but I was expecting more from this one... some evolution in style or content. I liked his earlier books because they were more raw, the stories a bit more unexpected. The beginning of this one felt a little recycled, and I was ready to be done reading it.But then about two-thirds of the way through, the stories lost their formulaic feeling, and an unexpected poignancy crept in. I ended up really enjoying the the last few stories, in particular the last, titled The Smoking Section. I think the editors started out with the lightest stories and saved the best for the end.

This collection of stories/anecdotes seemed more blog-worthy than book-worthy to me. It gave me the sense that he was under pressure to put another book out. To say something. So he follows the formula that's worked for him so well only this time the content's not nearly as entertaining, or noteworthy. One chapter is about a boil he had that his partner, Hugh, ended up popping for him. While I like gross, there's not much else to it. Speaking of Hugh, there was way too much of him. He's not nearly as entertaining or interesting as any of David's family members, particularly Amy. The book's ending chapters take place in Tokyo. Which I found refreshing, it's a much needed change of scenery. And there are some really funny scenes that take place here. But for the most part this section drags. It's like a SNL skit that starts off funny and you're hoping will just go ahead and end on a good joke but instead it just keeps going--unable to figure out how to wrap it up.

I still think \"Santaland Diaries\" is must-read material for this time of year and \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\" is one of the funniest books I've ever read, full stop. So it's a given that when he publishes a new book I have to buy it immediately. I know, \"When You are Engulfed in Flames\" came out in 2008, this is 2011, but I did try and read it 3 years ago but I gave up frustrated. The solution to completing it this time? - audiobooks. Sedaris reading his stories is a different beast to reading them yourself. I love podcasts and felt that him reading his stories was like listening to a podcast, telling everyone funny stories that had happened to him, and so I got through this book in a day after a few enjoyable hours spent listening to him while driving.His bad baby sitter, Mrs Peacock, was a funny and strange character who demanded back scratches and that David and his sisters clean her house while their parents were on holiday; his Italian neighbour in New York, Helen, who was this extremely bullying and unlikable person and who beat up a disabled kid for accidentally pocketing a biro of hers; and the Normandy neighbour who turned out to be child molester. While his characterisations of real people is always brilliant, what I liked better were the anecdotes centred around himself - arguing with cab drivers for whom English was a second language; giving up smoking in Japan; or sitting on a plane in first class next to a Polish man who couldn't stop crying as he'd just buried his mother. The foreign element tips it over for me as it reminds me of the brilliance of \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\" which also focused on language and communication issues. And most touching of all were his love letters to his boyfriend Hugh, for who is clear he is deeply in love with. \"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\" is not his best book but definitely an entertaining audiobook, particularly when Sedaris attempts voices of some of the characters. The anecdotes are far from stale but also not as entertaining as other volumes and this is why it took me a few years to get around to finishing it. Having done so though, I'm glad I did, and can recommend this as an antidote to hours of tedious driving."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob", "userReview": "A solid \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 and damn near close to \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 that we'll settle for \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd. But then again, I'm a serious Sedaris fiend.When You Are Engulfed In Flames makes Sedaris' previous collection, \nDress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\n, seem like a disaster, a complete train wreck. Which is unfair because I think that Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is a strong collection with some exemplary essays. And also because I get the feeling that it was a more personal werk for him, that he's a bit more exposed and vulnerable in those essays.Thematically, When You Are Engulfed In Flames is a reprise of \nMe Talk Pretty One Day\n -- highly focused on language and style, on the humanity of humiliation and (to echo some other reviewers) those dark places where our sentimentality tends to get the best of us. But it's a counterpoint melody to Me Talk Pretty One Day -- arrogant where the other was modest, chagrined where the other took delight.Structurally, this collection is an echo of \nNaked\n, though a bit more mature. As I wrote of DFW's \nConsider the Lobster\n, the essays are arranged well, jokes from earlier essays recurring, serving to inform your tittering later on. That said, the individual essays seem to follow a rhythm that is new for Sedaris. If this were an elementary school music class, I would say that his earlier essays have a rhyme scheme that goes ABAB, these are turned more toward ABCA.But if you're reading this, it's probably because you were curious what I thought of When You Are Engulfed In Flames.

Which range from being moderately entertaining (\"Memento Mori\", buying a human skeleton and its aftermath) to weirdly offputting (\"April in Paris\", in which the author's fascination with spiders is merely grotesque).True fans may enjoy this. If you are new to Sedaris, start with one of his earlier books. This book is primarily navelgazing, told with little of the wit that characterized his earlier work.It probably didn't help this review that I was reading Sedaris in parallel with Orwell's \"A Collection of Essays\" - the comparison only serves to emphasize the flimsiness of most of the Sedaris pieces."}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2370866-eva", "userReview": "Ok\u00e9, dit is vast vloeken in de kerk, maar ik vind hier echt niets aan.

Basically a catheter like situation that flows into a bag that is \"conveniently\" taped to your calf. It is for when you just don't want to get up and go to the washroom, you can pee into this sac and deal with the urine at a later time. \n(Other then the recommendation to not wear shorts apparently the skys the limit with the Stadium pal)Sedaris points out that this product was marketed exclusively to men as woman would have more sense then to piss themselves in public. I laughed my ass off. When You Are Engulfed in flames has this essay and many more and Sedaris, himself narrates the audiobook. I love Sedaris, his voice makes the experience that much more enjoyable. My favourite bits are when he is either outraged about something or when he tells stories that are about his family. One of my favourite stories takes place when he is 11 years old and his parents leave him and his sisters with a strange babysitter for a week.She is an overweight hillbilly who David and his sisters instantly dislike. When she walks around their house, she had \"this look as if she was as good as them, if not better \" to which 11 year old Sedaris states \"that just wasn't true\" This is what I love! Sedaris trying to not come off as a total snob but in essence the whole story is about how appalled they are by the class of this woman. The children take note of every infraction this woman commits and record these infractions and then\"As I read aloud from the complaint book during the daily crisis meeting we had in the woods behind our house\" I don't know what I love better the daily crisis meeting or the fact that there was a complaint book.
