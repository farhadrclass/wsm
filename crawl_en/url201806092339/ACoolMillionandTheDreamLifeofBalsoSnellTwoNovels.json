Surprisingly violent! And to think that this yellowing Avon paperback languished in my parents\u2019 unused basement sauna for at least 10 years, only to be rescued by me during the holidays; which is one of the few heartwarming stories in these \u201ctough economic times\u201d, as I\u2019ve been reduced to scrounging around for free books anywhere I can, and if they\u2019re set in the depression so much the better.The back cover copy says that \u201cA Cool Million dismantles, piece by piece, its hero and the Horatio Alger myth\u201d. Nothing could be more literally true. Poor Lem Pitkin is much like the heroine of de Sade\u2019s Justine (another book rescued from the same sauna at the same time, though I read that one years ago) \u2013 a multiply gullible innocent systematically destroyed by a maliciously self-centered world. By the end his corpse has been scalped, de-thumbed, de-legged, de-teethed, and de-eyed - but not de-dumbed; even as a chopped up man he still believes in the American dream and his pursuit of a \u201ccool million\u201d. And why was he seeking this $$ in the first place \u2013 because a rich Jew, Asa Goldstein, had bought his quaint ancestral home, thereby displacing himself and his mother (who\u2019s never seen again), so he could install it as the showpiece in his Manhattan shop window! Delillo has never put together so potent a satirical sequence as this.I forgot to mention that Lem\u2019s childhood sweetheart, after being raped by a local bully and left for dead, was abducted by Italian speaking Chinese hoodlums and made into a sex slave. Sick and funny stuff.Upon reading this I was asked who Horatio Alger was and I realized I didn\u2019t know much. I thought maybe he had written a book with a rags-to-riches theme, but I wasn\u2019t sure about much else, so I looked him up (wikipedia), and his story was nearly as interesting as this book. As a young Unitarian minister he quickly and quietly quitted his post, and the town, after a scandal involving two teenage boys. It wasn\u2019t until after his death that it was confirmed he had engaged in \u201cthe abominable and revolting crime of unnatural familiarity with boys\u201d. After his departure he spent the rest of his life tirelessly working to help impoverished children, his many \u201cAmerican dream\u201d books being just one aspect of this compassion. (Note: Compassion comment not ironic. Mr. Alger, contrary to whatever myths and stories have circulated down through time, seems like he was a complex guy who truly cared about kids.) I could say more, such as a biography that was actually a non-researched fantasia stood as the definitive life of Mr Alger for decades, and that his hometown recently removed his name from their annual celebration of his work with children once they found out about the pedophelia scandal... but this is a review of Nathanael West's novels...The Dream Life of Balso Snell is even more wildly inventive than A Cool Million, but didn\u2019t engage me nearly as much; though the hero\u2019s initial entry into the anus of the Trojan Horse definitely got my attention. From what I could gather the book is a send-up of many literary tastes and trends of the day \u2013 stream of consiousness, Gertrude Stein, Dostoevsky, etc \u2013 all a la Faust Part II."}, {"userName": "Jonfaith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327886-jonfaith", "userReview": "Certainly lacking in contrast, both of these works percolate in the fears and insecurities of not only a nation unsure of regaining its footing, there is something fundamental in his horror, Edmund Wilson was correct, West was our Kafka."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6137835-jay", "userReview": "This books resides on my \"WTF-s\" bookshelf because of the novella \"The Dream Life of Balso Snell\". Not to spoil anything, but the novel recounts the said Mr. Snell's journey into the anus and up the colon and beyond of the Trojan Horse (of yore) and his encounters with various personages along the \"journey\". One might call this \"experimental\" fiction, but it's more of an odd footnote (I almost said \"hoofnote\") to the genre of \"the hero's quest\", though Mr. Snell is not exactly heroic. Critics have read all manner of ridiculous and strained interpretations into this, the weakest of West's writings, which interpretations are as much a load of road apples as are absent in the Horse. Read this if you're a Nathaniel West fan, or if you've got nothing better to do and are looking for a break from meaningful literature. There's some humor here, but Mr. Ed was funnier.Footnote: The \"writer's bio\" on Goodreads for Nathaniel West contains this statement: \"At Brown University in New York, he befriended writer and humourist S. J. Perelman (who later married his sister), and started writing and drawing cartoons.\" \"In New York\"??? Obviously, this biographer, who used the British spelling of \"humourist\", doesn't know his arse from a crumpet: Brown University, also my alma mater, is in Providence, Rhode Island, and always has been."}, {"userName": "tENTATIVELY, cONVENIENCE", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/534016-tentatively-convenience", "userReview": "I probably found out about Nathanael West & read his 4 short bks when I was in my late teens. What a discovery! I divide his novels into the absurd (these 2) & the 'realistic' (\"Miss Lonelyhearts\" & \"The Day of the Locust\") but the delineation is tenuous. All 4 novels are social criticism. \"The Dream Life of Balso Snell\" is from 1931 & is a slim 60 pages. All I remember of it is that the protagonist finds the Trojan Horse & enters it thru its asshole - finding graffiti along the way. This was my favorite, probably b/c it was the most absurd. \"A Cool Million\" is West's parody of Horatio Alger stories - you know the ones: the newspaper boy works hard & thru dedication & the reward system of capitalism becomes a successful millionaire businessman. West blows the well-deserved holes thru that one. The subtitle of \"A Cool Million\" is \"The Dismantling of Lemuel Pitkin\" & the hero pursues fame & fortune w/ Alger-like naivity, failing every step of the way & gradually losing body parts in the process. 113pp, 1934, set in the depression."}, {"userName": "Gareth Reeves", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19475076-gareth-reeves", "userReview": "I feel that A Cool Million deserves more readers. An outrageous lampooning of the American dream and a picaresque which manages to out-brutalize Lazarillo de Tormes.

You were warned ;-)\"The Dream Life of Balso Snell.\" I read this book -- also very short (about 60 pages) -- as an allegory. The protag is a poet who enters the Trojan horse (i.e. an iconic artifact of the classical literary canon) through \"the posterior opening of the alimentary canal\" (heh) (The only other two openings were the the mouth, but that was out of Balso's reach, and the navel, but that \"proved a cul-de-sac.\" Double heh.)Once inside the horse's digestive tract, Balso encounters a number of peculiar individuals, all of whom want to talk his ear off. He finally realizes what they all have in common:\"The wooden horse, Balso realized as he walked on, was inhabited solely by writers in search of an audience.\"Kind of like my Twitter feed :-DAs soon as Balso reaches that realization, he makes a resolution:\"H]e was determined not to be tricked into listening to another story. If one had to be told, he would tell it.\"Totally cracked me up. Yet interestingly, the book ends not by Balso writing/telling a story . . . suggesting that for West, the resolution of Balso the poet's dilemma was not to write, but something else entirely . . ."}, {"userName": "Cullen Gallagher", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/696310-cullen-gallagher", "userReview": "\"A Cool Million\" is to literature what Preston Sturges' \"Miracle at Morgan's Creek\" was to cinema: a cleverly satirical jab at society that uses conventional narrative forms as a means of criticism and creativity...and unstoppable laughter. West's \"Million\" is like a cinema serial gone completely awry...as though the naive heros and heroines of those cliffhanger episodes were dragged through the worst that contemporary life had to offer. \"The Dream Life of Balso Snell,\" on the other hand, is an intriguing if incoherent riff on Dante's Inferno, led through the innards of a Trojan Horse. As the hero encounters one desperate failed writer (and lover, and human being) after another, one can't help but be disturbed by West's rampant nihilism. Humor is eclipsed by his uniquely jaded psychosis....I can't figure what it all means. Not as good as \"Million\" but worth reading to see West's wide range of talents."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2002005-bill", "userReview": "Nathanael West wrote two of my favorite 20th Century American novels: Miss Lonelyhearts and Day of the Locust. I didn't realize (until a few months ago) that he'd also written two other novels: The Dream Life of Balso Snell and A Cool Million. These novels aren't nearly as good as his others and aren't really worth reading, unless you are a student of American Literature or a completist.Of the two in this collection, A Cool Million does have some entertaining moments, but gets so ridiculous that I had to force myself to finish it. I was struck by how much the Shagpoke Whipple character seemed almost contemporary in the way that he championed the capitalist American Dream (like a Ronald Reagan or Rush Limbaugh). I guess West was spoofing Horatio Alger stories in this novel; but since I haven't read anything by Alger, that point didn't increase my enjoyment of the book."}, {"userName": "John G.", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11307916-john-g", "userReview": "Greatly enjoyed this book and these stories! Hard to believe these were written in 1931 and 34, the language and issues are quite contemporary. West has a unique voice and vision, I read his \"collected works\" sometime back and these were the two stories that stood out from that collection, even thought they aren't hailed as his best pieces. Dream Life of Balso Snell is simply bizarre and weird and trippy, never read anything quite like it. Wonderfully inventive and playfully irreverent! A Cool Million is a sad, dark, brutal indictment of the free market ideology, an anti-Horatio Alger story if there ever was one. Again, this story is hauntingly ahead of it's time and captures the current mood and mindset of this election campaign to a tee. West was almost a century ahead of his time, have to get his other books too and reread them with fresh eyes."}, {"userName": "Zach", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8720137-zach", "userReview": "Balso was fun but weird. A Cool Million was exactly as advertised, a very (very) sarcastic jab at Horatio Alger stories. Both were good. Day of the Locust/Miss Lonelyhearts are clearly the high points in his criminally short career. I always forget how funny West is and more so, how modern his humor feels. His sarcasm and satire still feel razor sharp today. I really wish we could have gotten one more novel out of him.
