He is an alchemist who turns what is base and depressing and disastrous into gold that sparkles with exuberance, a sense of adventure, and hope. And a vein of optimistic and wide-eyed wonder runs through the gold like silver.This novel tells the story of two young orphaned boys who happen to take shelter beneath the same shrub in a rainstorm and become fast friends. They experience hardship together where hunger and lack of decent clothing and no shelter is hard to bear, but they do survive and find ways to ensure their basic needs are taken care of. They follow what small opportunities knock - right into the army out west. They grow in love with each other and they adopt as their own a little orphaned Sioux girl to love and take care of.There is far more in this story to discover as their adventures also include a ferocious stint in the Union army during the Civil War \u2013 until they are captured.The time frame of this story has to have been one of the most brutal in the history of the United States. Persecution of different races was everywhere; immigrants of all kinds were at risk no matter where they found themselves. There was always someone meaner, more filled with hatred, and/or more desperate who was willing to put their own life on the line to take the life and possessions of another.For the narrator Thomas McNulty and his partner John Cole, this was their way of life and they learned to take care of themselves \u2013 and each other \u2013 because that was part of their way of life as well. This was also a time when some people started questioning this life and lifestyle, and Thomas and John were two of those people. They didn\u2019t put themselves in jeopardy if they could help it, but they also did what they could - whenever they could - to right the wrongs they encountered.The writing. Oh my, the magic of it. There may have been five sentences in the entire book that weren\u2019t quote-worthy. If so, I didn\u2019t find them.\nThen the rain began to fall in an extravagant tantrum. High up in mountain country though we were, every little river became a huge muscled snake, and the water wanted to find out everything, the meaning of our sad roofs for instance, the meaning of our bunk beds beginning to take on the character of little barks, the sure calculation that if it fell day and night no human man was going to get his uniform dry. We was wet to the ribs.\nThis story, the way it was presented, and the way it flows on the page are an ultimate gift. Despite the discomfort I felt reading of the brutality of the time, this is one of the best novels I have read this year. It is also the best writing I have ever encountered. This book is going straight onto my all-time Favorites bookshelf and I would give it 10 Stars if it were possible."}, {"userName": "Hannah Greendale", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale", "userReview": "Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.

I would compare it to McCarthy's Blood Meridian although different in style. But both bloody stories, told in the poetic voice of two different authors. A contradiction of poetry and bloody war which in a weird way works, delivering a heartfelt book. Not an easy read for me, but beautifully written... Focus was essential for me to really appreciate the story. Because of study and work, I wasn't able to do so at first, and oh, the book I had was so tiny and the pages crammed with text.

It is told through the eyes and in the words of Thomas McNulty, and his language carries you away like a river.

Can't do much about that. We have our store of days and we spend them like forgetful drunkards.

But likewise sometimes the fog of usual thoughts clears off in a sudden breeze of sense and you see things clear a moment like a clearing country. We blunder through and call it wisdom but it ain't. They say we be Christians and suchlike but we ain't. They say we are creatures raised by God above the animals but any man that has lived knows that's damned lies. \nDays Without End is extremely well-written historical fiction that overall left me admiring the prose and language far more than enjoying the somewhat improbable circumstances and unfolding events of the novel. This was my first time reading Sebastian Barry, and his talent to turn a phrase and paint with words vivid descriptions all in the voice of a singular character is incredible. I felt a bit removed though from the proceedings: even though I believed the emotions and ideas described, I myself was not invested in the outcome, mainly because the ending felt inevitable and a bit predictable (if not also sentimental and satisfying). But I thoroughly loved the writing: the descriptions, dialogue, and reflections on war and brutality and suffering and friendship were so grounded in reality and yet elevated to almost poetry in terms of the beauty. I'd probably give this 3.5 stars, but rounded up to 4 for its overall literary excellence, even if I wasn't emotionally connected or drawn into the characters and events to the same extent as I was hooked on the craft. I may continue to flesh out this review as I let this full story digest with me, but for now, I would recommend this to readers of literary and historical fiction with interest in the American West and Civil War, who embrace a somewhat slow tale in which the writing holds more attention than the events.-received ARC on edelweiss thanks to Viking and Penguin Random House"}, {"userName": "Violet wells", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells", "userReview": "Fabulous storytelling and narrative voice. The excitement of this novel told in feverish lyrical prose is unrelenting. We get an intimate first-hand account of the plains wars with the Sioux, the civil war and the lawlessness of the settler towns in the wild west. There\u2019s barely a page in this novel where you\u2019re not fearing for the lives of the novel\u2019s three central characters who form a misfit family \u2013 two male lovers and their adopted Indian child. The surface of this novel is dazzling.Beneath the surface it wasn\u2019t perhaps quite so successful. There\u2019s so much action in this novel that the characters barely have time to talk to each other which means we don\u2019t get to know them very well. And the narrator doesn\u2019t do nuance where his friends are concerned. He\u2019s unremittingly generous. Therefore, we learn little about his companions except that they are flawless human beings, deserving of our full sympathy. In this respect I couldn\u2019t help comparing it a little unfavorably with Peter Carey\u2019s True History of the Kelly Gang \u2013 another novel narrated lyrically by a semi-educated outcast with lots of exciting plot but also with some great character development \u2013 something this novel does lack. For example, the Sioux girl the two men adopt has little more personality than a domestic pet. She adapts to her new life like a domestic pet as well, as if she has no long-term memory. She\u2019s there to make us feel more protective of the characters and though this works as a device one never really sees her or believes much in her. The depiction of the Sioux in general was rather lazy, expedient and erroneously cliched. Barry invents a chief who behaves how the plot needs him to behave. (I\u2019ve read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and watched the excellent TV series Into the West and as far as I recall the real chief at that time would have been Red Cloud who was a lot more savvy and honorable than Barry\u2019s rather slapstick Caught-His-Horse-First. However, these are small gripes as Days Without End is a riveting read from start to finish. For those who\u2019ve already read and loved this I\u2019d recommend True History of the Kelly Gang."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "Sebastian Barry\u2019s \u201cDays Without End\u201d was a bit reminiscent to me of the strange travels in \u201cNews of the World\u201d with writing that reminded me of my grandfather\u2019s reading to me of Walt Whitman. Not that I haven\u2019t read Whitman on my own, but I only hear it anymore in my grandfather\u2019s voice. There\u2019s a lovely, if somber, touch to the writing, with prose that sings the song of every man. \n\u201cWe were two wood-shavings of humanity in a rough world.\u201d\nThis story is narrated by a young Thomas McNulty, a youth who fled Ireland during the time of the Great Famine, came to America, and after many years surviving as a dancer in a saloon along with his then new-found friend John Cole, they volunteered and joined the Army when he was seventeen, or thereabouts, in Missouri. \n\u201dIf you had all your limbs they took you. If you were a one-eyed boy they might take you too even so. The only pay worse than the worst pay in America was army pay.\u201d\n\n\u201c Yes, the army took me, I\u2019m proud to say. Thank God John Cole was my first friend in America and so in the army too and the last friend for that matter. He was with me nearly all through this exceeding surprising Yankee sort of life which was good going in every way. No more than a boy like me but even at sixteen years old he looked like a man right enough. I first saw him when he was fourteen or so, very different. That\u2019s what the saloon owner said too.\u201d\nThey go off, at first, to fight the Indian Wars against the Sioux and the Yurok, and then later, the Civil War. Between those two wars, they bring an eight year-old Sioux girl to live with them. A girl that Mrs. Neale, the Major\u2019s wife, had been teaching, she had learned English and her letters and numbers, along with some cooking skills. Still, Mrs. Neale only agrees to allow this after Thomas assures her that they only want this girl for a servant and not for \u201ctheir own solace,\u201d and he promises to protect her as his own child. They call her Winona, and from thereon she is known as John Cole\u2019s daughter in a legal sense, but in reality they view her as nothing less than their daughter. \n\u201d I guess it\u2019s long ago now. Seems to sit right up in front of my eyes just now though.\u201d\nTime. The passage of time is one of the details of life he often reflects on.\n\u201dTime was not something then we thought of as an item that possessed an ending, but something that would go on forever, all rested and stopped in that moment. Hard to say what I mean by that. You look back at all the endless years when you never had that thought. I am doing that now as I write these words in Tennessee. I am thinking of the days without end of my life.\u201d\nNature is another object of his reflections. Life in the war and after, the endless nights of sleeping in cold so bitter and deep it could take your life. Days and nights so hot you could barely breathe. The land. The sky viewed as if it were a painting.\n\u201dNow in these different districts, the sun came up that bit earlier, more eagerly, more like the baker putting fire into his bread oven, in the small hours, so the women in the town would have bread bright early. Lord, that sun rose regular and sere, he didn\u2019t care who saw him, naked and round and white. Then the rains came walking over the land, as exciting the new grasses, thundering down, hammering like fearsome little bullets, making the shards and dusts of the earth dance a violent jig. Making the grass seeds drunk with ambition. Then the sun pouring in after the rain, and the wide endless prairie steaming, a vast and endless vista of white steam rising, and the flocks of birds wheeling and turning, a million birds to one cloud, we\u2019d a needed a blunderbuss to harvest them, small black fleet wondrous birds.\u201d\nLife, what comprises a life at the end of it, the things we recall when stripped down to the days when our breaths can be counted.\n\u201dA man\u2019s memory might have only a hundred clear days in it and he has lived thousands. Can\u2019t do much about that. We have our store of days and we spend them like forgetful drunkards.\u201d\nWar is brutal, gloomy, dark and disturbing, and yet this book couldn\u2019t be more poetic, more powerful, more remarkable, more captivating, more of a pleasure to read, or just plain lovelier.

First and foremost it was the writing with language that soars in its simplicity. Secondly, Barry gives us big slice of American history in such a small volume, which is powerful and painful to read at times. This is not for the faint of heart as there are some vivid descriptions of brutality but if you can get past these there is amidst the violence and brutality, beauty in the love and a sense of family found here . I\u2019ve read other books by Sebastian Barry but this one was different not focusing on Irish family plights, although our narrator Thomas McNulty has fled the famine in Ireland . It\u2019s impossible to not get connected to Thomas and John Cole , orphaned boys who find each hiding under a bush and find in each other a friend, a partner in survival, a partner in life, in horrendous deeds, in war and their love for a young Sioux girl who becomes their daughter.I\u2019m not going to rehash the plot here. There are many reviews which will give more detail. I\u2019m not sure I can say anything more than I have, other than highly recommended. I will though, link to two stellar reviews that convinced me to read this. Jaline\u2019s review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Hugh\u2019s review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "This is the first book I have read that is new enough to qualify for this year's Booker prize, and it sets the bar pretty high. This is a wild picaresque fantasy set in nineteenth century America, and is very different to any of Barry's previous novels, all of which are much closer to modern Ireland. This time the narrator Thomas, another member of the Sligo McNulty family, is a poor Irish boy who has lost his family to the potato famine and has found his way across the Atlantic.Thomas meets John Cole, a slightly older American born drifter when they are sheltering from rain under a hedge. It soon becomes clear that this is more than just a simple friendship. Their first job is dressing up as girls to act as hired dancers in a mid-Western town. When this work reaches its natural end because John is too big, they enlist in the army and are involved in various skirmishes with the local Indians (it seems wrong to use the term native Americans in this 19th century context). After one of these, Thomas and John find themselves adopting a girl who was the niece of the local chief, and they leave the army to start a new life as entertainers in Grand Rapids, a mining town, but are soon persuaded to rejoin the Army when the civil war breaks out. The remainder of the book follows their escapades after the war.As in his earlier book A Long Long Way, Barry describes war in chaotic and unsentimental detail, but the farcical elements of this story are never far from the surface. McNulty's voice is a wonderful hybrid, probably too literate to be plausible, but that seems a necessary artifice and makes the story much more readable. The plot stretches credulity at times, but has some lovely twists, and this makes for a very satisfying read. This might just be Barry's best book yet, and is certainly the most audacious."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "Whatever it was that I was expecting from this novel, it's not what I got. It was more bloody, more beautiful, more affecting than anything I had imagined. Even if sometimes I felt like it lost itself within its own cleverness, this did not detract from the overall power of the story and the narrator. If anything the dissonance between the voice and the character of Thomas McNulty is what makes his piercing perceptiveness so effective- he is talking about more than his own story, he reflects the greater story of contemporary America as a whole. But if that sounds just too grand, it is again the common man narrator that ensures the book is entirely readable, funny, and one in which you lose yourself, heart and mind.Many thanks to Sebastian Barry, Faber and Faber, and Netgalley for the chance to read this in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "\"Things just go on. Lot of life is just like that. I look back over fifty years of life and I wonder where the years went. I guess they went like that, without me noticing much. A man\u2019s memory might have only a hundred clear days in it and he has lived thousands. Can\u2019t do much about that. We have our store of days and we spend them like forgetful drunkards. I ain\u2019t got no argument with it, just saying it is so.\"\nWhat an absolutely beautiful story. And believe me, I never thought I'd find myself saying that about a Civil War-era novel. I'm not particularly one for war stories in general. If I read one I'm much more interested in looking at how civilian life is affected by war and the ways in which people cope with that disruption of everyday life, so I usually stay away from battlefront narratives.But this book is so much more than a war story.First and foremost, it's about a man named Thomas McNulty who's emigrated from Ireland and made his way to the U.S. during the American Indian wars, especially ones on the Great Plains. Then it moves into the Civil War-era where he finds himself once again at war fighting for the Union. Along the way he's accompanied by John Cole, his best friend and secret lover. (The blurb doesn't really highlight their romance, but it's very clear in the story, though not really a main plot\u2014just a fact.) Later on they take in a young Native American girl who becomes like their daughter. The three of them go through many adventures over the span of many years.Things I loved about this book:-The writing style: It took a bit of getting used to because it's written in a very conversational style, often with improper grammar. But wow. Barry is a master at this style. After a while I barely noticed it, and instead felt like Thomas was speaking directly to me.-The characters: Though I do wish we had gotten to see a bit more of John, overall all the characters were extremely realistic, even the side characters in the army that we only saw for bits and pieces of the story. I was completely invested in their lives, and it was really this that kept me reading when the plot wasn't as exciting.-The length: This isn't a long book, and I feel like Barry could've made it twice as long, filled it with even more events over the years, and probably could've gotten away with it. But it's brevity serves the story well. It was amazing what he could do to emotionally stir up the reader in such a short span of time.Though you can see I thought this book was phenomenal, I am positive there will be people who read this and go...\"huh?\" It's not for every reader. But it was perfect for me. And again, I'm thankful that books like this were put on the Man Booker longlist because I might otherwise never gotten around to reading it."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "Has an Irishman written the Great American Novel? The question is not theoretical; Sebastian Barry\u2019s latest novel is the fourth time he has been longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. The novel is his seventh, but it is Barry\u2019s long experience writing for the theatre\u2014thirteen plays already\u2014that lends excitement to this work. After the years of excellent effort, suddenly Thomas Thomasina McNulty springs full-grown from Barry\u2019s well-tilled field. The extraordinary success of this gem of a novel set in 1850\u2019s America is all about preparedness and inspiration.The novel is not long but is fluent and unstrained; it makes big statements about human existence, war, love, about what we want, and what we get. It is remarkable how squarely Barry lands in the middle of the American debate so clamorous around us now, about race, diversity, sexuality, what we fight for and who fights for us\u2014questions we\u2019ve never satisfactorily answered, and so they are back again. Barry gives us humor in a horribly violent world, surprising and delighting us with his deadpan delivery. His diverse cast of characters are reliant on one another, all viewed through the eyes of an Irishman who\u2019d suffered such terrible deprivations as a child that man\u2019s cruelty never surprised him. What did surprise him was that we could find a way to love, to happiness, despite our sorrows.In the early pages Thomas McNulty meets John Cole under a hedge in a rainstorm. John Cole is a few years older, but both the orphaned young boys is a wild thing, having \u2018growed' in the school of hard knocks. Uncanny judges of character, they almost instantly decide they stand a better chance together in the rough-and-tumble than alone and set off on a series of adventures. The pace of the novel is swift. When I go back to find a memorable passage, I am shocked at how quickly events unfolded, and how quickly I am deeply involved.The language is one of the novel's wonders. Barry doesn\u2019t try to hide his brogue, but uses it: a stranger in a strange land. That distance and perspective allows Thomas to make comment upon what is commonly observed  \"Everything bad gets shot in America, says John Cole, and everything good too.\" and  \"I know I can rely on the kindness of folk along the way. The ones that don\u2019t try to rob me will feed me. That how it is in America.\" The novel constantly surprises: when the boys answer the ad hung awry on a saloon door in a broken-down Kansas town, \u201cClean Boys Wanted,\u201d we prepare for the worst. Within pages we are jolly and laughing, then agonized and pained, then back again, our emotions rocketing despite the tamped-down telling. Our initial sense of extreme danger never really leaves us, but serves to prepare us for the Indian wars, those pitiful, personal slaughters, and the Civil War, which comes soon enough.The most remarkable bits of this novel, the sense of a shared humanity within a wide diversity, seemed so natural and obvious and wonderful we wanted to crawl under that umbrella and shelter there. These fierce fighting men fought for each other rather than for an ideal. Their early lives were so precarious they\u2019d formed alliances across race, religion, national origin when they were treated fair. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me a Irish is an example of civilised humanity\u2026you\u2018re talking to two when you talk to one Irishman.\u201dAnd then there is the notion of time, if it is perceived at all by youth: \u201cTime was not something then we thought of as an item that possessed an ending\u2026\u201d By the end of the novel, the characters do indeed perceive time: \u201cI am doing that now as I write these words in Tennessee. I am thinking of the days without end of my life. And it is not like that now.\u201d We have been changed, too, because we also perceive time, and sorrow and pain and those things that constitute joy. We have lived his life, and ours, too.Barry gets so much right about the America he describes: the sun coming up earlier and earlier as one travels east, the desert-but-not-desert plains land, the generosity and occasional cooperation between the Indian tribes and the army come to dispatch them, the crazy deep thoughtless racism. But what made me catch my breath with wonder was the naturalness of the union between Thomasina McNulty and John Cole and the fierceness of the love these two army men had for an orphaned, laughing, high-spirited, bright star of an Indian girl they called Winona. Barry understands absolutely that our diversity makes us stronger, better men. Leave the pinched and hateful exclusion of differentness to sectarian tribes, fighting for the old days. We know what the old days were like. We can do better. I haven\u2019t read all the Man Booker longlist yet, but most, and this is at the top of my list. It is a treasure.I had access to the Viking Penguin hardcopy of this novel--I'm still surprised at how small it is, given the expansive nature of the story--but I also had the audio from Hoopla. I needed both: the pace of the novel is swift, and may cause us to read faster than we ought. Barry writes poetically, which by rights should slow us down. The Blackstone Audio production, though read quickly by Aidan Kelly, allows us to catch things we will have missed in print and vice versa. At several stages in this novel, crises impel us forward. As we rush to see what happens, we may miss the beauty. Don't miss the beauty. Books like these are so very rare."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "Wow, you know, this book is just really not for me. First I tried reading it in print and the language felt so archaic and forced, and part of me was resisting the idea of an Irishman writing a western, I think. My immediate gut reaction was a big nope.But it's on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize! And people I respect have given it five stars!I decided to try it on audio because it's available in Hoopla, but it's the kind of story where my brain just tunes it out. And it's weird to hear it in an Irish accent because the words LOOK like an American western. I understand the main character is an Irish immigrant but I suspect a dryer American plains voice would have been a better choice to communicate the feeling of the language.

While it shares some elements with Westerns and Civil War fiction, it\u2019s unique in several ways. Though thrilling and episodic, it\u2019s deeply thoughtful as well. Thomas writes semi-literate English but delivers profound, beautiful statements all the same. Lovely metaphors and memorable turns of phrase abound.

Nothing but scum.\u201d-Thomas McNulty, Days Without End\nSebastian Barry captures the essence of identity in exile with his most recent novel, Days Without End. Young Thomas McNulty has left his Irish Nation having lost his family to the Famine to seek his future in \"Amerikay,\" as almost a million and a half of his fellow countrymen did.At the tender age of seventeen, Thomas lands in America in 1850. Unlike the majority of Irish who settled in significant American urban centers, McNulty ends up in the unlikely location of Missouri. There he meets John Cole, also seventeen. Cole is on the road from his Massachusetts home, a bit of an exile himself.Thomas and John throw in together as they strike out on the Oregon Trail. To support themselves the two respond to an advertisement to become cross dressed dancers, offering a bit of purported femininity to women starved miners along the trail. The appearance of youth disappears quickly, however. Another occupation must be found. Soldiering is the easy choice.This is the Army of America's Manifest Destiny. Thomas and John become inured to the horror of war as their regiment is posted to California to rid the Gold Rush country of American Indians to provide land to greedy Forty-Niners. These Indians are not hostile. But they are an obstacle to American expansion. The two friends become part of a massacre of the peaceful Yurok Tribe.Thomas ruminates on the draw of the Irish to soldiering.\n\u201cHow we were able to see slaughter without flinching. Because we were nothing ourselves, to begin with...\u201d\nBarry sends his two protagonists through the Plains Indian Wars, the American Civil War, and Reconstruction in relentless cycles of violence. Perhaps it is in an effort to cling to life that Thomas and John cling to one another in a bond greater than mere friendship.This is a novel of incredible beauty. It is a novel that revels in the growth of identity, the meaning of love, friendship, and family. Barry layers the novel with one perfect sentence after another. It comes as no surprise that Barry began writing as a poet. He continues his expression in phrases of unparalled lyricism.This is a cracking read with which I begin my year of reading in 2017.

Days Without End is one of the finest books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. (I\u2019ve luckily been able to say this twice this year!)Winner of the Costa Book Award, this historical fiction is about two young Irish men leaving the great famine behind to come to America. Thomas McNulty, in the first narrative, takes us through American history with his best friend and partner, John Cole, by joining the Army to make a living. A violently written novel, the author, Sebastian Barry, vividly portrays the US Indian wars and the Civil War. His two main characters are the finest of mankind. Two people you would love to count as friends. Fighting men as brave as they come, but also fiercely loyal and kind-hearted.What a joy to listen to the Irish brogue of Aidan Kelly. I am thankful to have decided on the audiobook. The writing had me looking through the eyes of McNulty like I was there throughout their hardships and adventures.Unbeknownst to me, Sebastian Barry is an Irish poet, playwright, and novelist. Days Without End shows his poetic influence. Just beautifully written.

I\u2019ve read a great deal of books in differing styles, and somehow it still surprises me when I come across something so inimitable as this. What gives this book it\u2019s individuality, in my opinion, is Thomas\u2019s voice. He\u2019s such an amalgam of resilience, determination, gentleness and courage. Above all, he\u2019s honest with himself about his true nature, a man ahead of his time. In this story you\u2019ll find violence and cruelty, apropos to the time period and setting, but you\u2019ll also find family, love, and loyalty in abundance.

I don't know if I just wasn't in the mood for lyrical westerns or the fact I poked my eyeball with a stalk of grass half way through or that I just could not fully believe in these Civil War era cross dressing soldiers. Whatever the reason, I just didn't have the love for this. It was undoubtably a beautifully written jewel of a thing, but it left me cold. I was a few chapters in before I realised Sebastian Barry is creating a kind of grand opus of the McNulty family. The others being The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty, The Secret Scripture and The Temporary Gentleman only one of which I have read before. I have yet to work out where our stoic, dress-loving narrator Thomas McNulty fits within this family tree. But I do like this idea of interlinked novels and it is possible I would enjoy this more if I read them all and considered them as an entire work.The world-weary narration of Irish soldier McNulty, reveals a cataclysmic time in American history, the brutality of the American-Indian wars is closely followed by a bitter Civil War. For a book set within such violent times this is a remarkably understated novel. The harshness of the frontier and the casual violence is all rendered in lush poetic prose and the oftentimes blunt and almost off-hand commentary from McNulty never risks this becoming too sentimental for the era. It does risk holding the reader at a bit of a remove and while I enjoyed the historical and sensory descriptions in this I don't think the relationships between characters really worked for me. I suppose I was looking for more angst such as was found in Proulx's  Brokeback Mountain  or some kind of deeper connection with other characters. This is a book that needs quiet contemplation and to be read in more sizeable sittings than I managed. Entirely possible that this may rise in my estimation upon a reread. Leaving you with McNulty ...... I only say it because without saying I don't think anything can be properly understood. How we were able to see slaughter without flinching.

Days Without End is Sebastian Barry's seventh title in a canon that follows the Dunnes of Dublin and the McNultys of Sligo through two centuries and multiple continents. I first encountered Barry through his soul-ripping A Long, Long Way, one of the most powerful war (in this case WWI) novels I have ever encountered. And then again in A Secret Scripture, a private meditation on grief and memory and a rebuke of a culture that bound women into a prison of inescapable social mores. Of the others in this collection\u2014not a series, really, but a world linked by family and place\u2014I have yet to read, but in time, I will. Sebastian Barry, like his fellow Irish literary contemporaries Colm Toibin, Colum McCann, Anne Enright, counts among the writers whose commanding style and fearless storytelling inspire and slay me. Days Without End is an American story told through the eyes and heart of Irish-born Tom McNulty, whose family fled famine on the island for rangy freedom in North America. Tom meets John Cole when the two are teenagers scrabbling for purchase in rough-and-ready 1849 Missouri. They find work as young saloon dancers, offering chaste comfort to miners desperate for a tender female touch. In dresses and petticoats they make their way and fall in love with each other, until their bodies usher them into undeniable manhood. Then they become warriors, charged with clearing the Plains states of buffalo and Sioux. Both men were born into violence, into an Ireland gutted of Irish, cleared by English soldiers. So perhaps it is inevitable that their history would track them to a fledgling nation, to be repeated in reverse. They become the occupiers, seeking to eradicate the history that stands in the way of a new and growing country's wealth and domination. Their external lives are marked by violence and deprivation. Their internal lives are bound by love. Into this dreamlike clash of horror and beauty, another unlikely love blooms. Winona, a young Sioux girl, becomes a ward of the US Army after her tribe is slaughtered and the two lovers adopt her, a misfit trio founded on violence and need. When the Civil War lands Thomas and John onto yet another battlefield, they fight Confederate soldiers from an Irish contingent, men they would have tilled fields side-by-side at home. What a rich and complicated novel. I reeled with each page, cringing in horror at the Great Plains massacres and Civil War atrocities, astonished by the elegance of Barry's prose, the fresh wonder of Thomas McNulty's voice, the lovely matter-of-factness of taboo love and the shock of willing participation in America's brutal expansion. Days Without End is a work of staggering beauty."}, {"userName": "Chadwick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2518644-chadwick", "userReview": "\"Things that give you heart are rare enough, better note them in your head when you find them and not forget.\"DAYS WITHOUT END is the latest entry from Sebastian Barry in his loose, multi-generational McNulty family series, and it's his best one yet. With this one, he takes us to a completely different time and place: the American West, the Indian Wars, and the Civil War. It's a surprising and wholly original take on men in wartime.There is harrowing violence and suffering: battlefields, massacres, a POW camp, famine in Ireland (and hellishness on ships escaping from it). But there's no sentimentality, and few false notes in Barry's descriptions. His characters are honest and true, and full of real-life contradictions. Good people do some very bad things. In his depiction of war, we see heroism and cowardice, stupidity and wisdom, terror and exhilaration, brutality and compassion. Mostly these soldiers just get on with it: \"Nothing too tricky about dying for your country. It's the easiest item on the menu.\" Barry's novel has received some attention for its depiction of homosexuality and cross-dressing among American soldiers. (I hope that's not a spoiler; it's revealed very early in the book.) But for all the fuss about that, the book is really about so much more. It's about love and compassion in the toughest of circumstances. Yes, there's romantic love . . . but also parental love, platonic love, and the unique bonds that men in combat share with each other. And it's also a fresh and important take on the Irish experience in America.As powerful as Barry's story is, his economy is even more striking. He seems to have packed a whole world into this slender novel.The story is tough and tender in equal measure. It's also witty and funny. I'm not sure I've read anything quite like it. It's a truly unique and unsettling work of fiction. Barry's prose is clean and lovely, and the first-person narration is pitch-perfect. He has captured the voice of Thomas McNulty just so.\"Time was not something then we thought of as an item that possessed an ending, but something that would go on forever, all rested and stopped in that moment. . . . You look back at all the endless years when you never had that thought. I am doing that now as I write these words in Tennessee. I am thinking of the days without end of my life. . . . I am wondering what words we said so carelessly that night, what vigorous nonsense we spoke, what drunken shouts we shouted, what stupid joy there was in that, and how John Cole was only young then and as handsome as any person that has ever lived. Young, and there would never be a change for that. The heart rising, and the soul singing.\"This extraordinary novel gave me heart, and I won't forget it.Here's a glass raised to Sebastian Barry and his McNulty family. I hope there are many more of their stories to come."}, {"userName": "Gill", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18845147-gill", "userReview": "Review published on Goodreads on 10th October 2016'Days Without End' by Sebastian Barry5 stars/ 10 out of 10I have read several of Sebastian Barry's earlier books (my favourite of which is 'The Secret Scripture'), so I was very interested in reading this latest novel of his.This novel is a first person narrative told by Thomas McNulty, who came over to the USA from Ireland as a child, during the Famines. It tells of his life as a soldier in both the Indian Wars and the Civil War, and after.The period covered by the novel is a period in North American history of which I only have a sketchy knowledge. One of the things that I like about Barry's writing, is that I feel confident that he is historically accurate. So I don't feel the need to question these aspects of the narrative. It was a slow read, but in a good way. The story was very detailed, and the back and forward stories of the main characters were revealed as the story developed. There were many moments of surprise for me along the way. The language was so beautiful, that I wanted to savour it. The only slight niggle I had occasionally was, as to whether the narrator, Thomas McNulty, would, in reality, have talked in such poetic language. I'm guessing that Barry's answer to this would be that there is poetry in all of us. Whilst I am reading his work, he convinces me of this. Barry's great skill as a writer is to show to the reader, the nuances and subtleties that there are in all of humanity.I thought this was an excellent novel, and is one that I look forward to re-reading at some stage.Thank you to Faber and Faber Ltd and to NetGalley for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Marialyce", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce", "userReview": "I am giving up.
