However, I was really intrigued by the whole premise and concept of this novel and felt in the right mood for something surreal and meta. Also, it was 99p in the Kindle sale.The book opens with Richard, an unsuccessful writer, finding the body of his neighbour Sylvie in her flat. Following a number of strange clues, Richard discovers that Sylvie was a member of a cult-like organisation devoted to Self (the clues being a mysterious card emblazoned with the letters 'WSC', posters of Will Self all over the walls, and, er, the fact that Sylvie had just undergone plastic surgery in an attempt to physically resemble her hero). The narrative goes on to skip back and forth through time, exploring the secrets of the Self obsessives, the mystery of Sylvie's death and the progression of Richard's 'career', all in an abstract style which is heavy with references to Self's work. Later in the book, the author also inserts herself into the narrative - or does she?I started off quite excited by the idea of this unusual story and I was instantly drawn in by the questions surrounding the WSC. But by the time I was a third of the way through I found myself skipping pages, and by the end I had lost all interest. My main problem with this book wasn't so much that I didn't understand it: rather, I didn't care enough to actually try and understand it. I won't pretend that I really 'got' everything that was going on, but I just wasn't bothered about the characters or the plot at all, and I also felt the narrative often sounded amateurish and the voices didn't vary enough between the different narrators. Ultimately I thought it was just too 'clever' and 'weird' for its own good, and nowhere near well-written enough to sustain that type of avant-garde narrative experimentation. Maybe an avid Will Self fan would get more out if it, but it left me cold, I'm afraid."}, {"userName": "Phillip Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/949843-phillip-edwards", "userReview": "Quiddity means what? It means the essential nature of something, from the latin 'quid' meaning 'what'. And 'What?' was the first word that crossed my mind when I heard something heavy drop through my letterbox one morning. This book was the what - courtesy Sam Mills herself, who sent me a copy as a reward for slagging off Nick Clegg on Twitter. I was delighted because this was one of those books that make my eyes light up the moment I hear about them. So, I hear you ask, it's about what?What connects a young man who finds the body of Will Self in 2006 and a lesbian book reviewer in 2049? The WSC that's what. A literary cult devoted to Will Self towards which they are both drawn, along with its shadowy leader Jamie Curren, author of How Will Self Can Change Your Life.As the young man, Richard Smith, explores Self's body of work he becomes more and more obsessed - possessed even - by the sesquipedalian genius of the real Will Self, whose physical body it was not. The murdered 'Will Self' from part one haunts the real Will Self in part two, while in part three Richard is imprisoned in a tower block writing The Diary of a Murderer under the care? of a psychiatrist called Professor Self (no relation) who is experimenting with some literary potions.Mia, the lesbian book reviewer, receives a mysterious package containing Richard's diary, that sets her on the trail of the WSC in part four and last, but not least, in part five we meet my favourite character: 'the author' 'Sam Mills' - who reminded me a little of Timothy Cavendish in David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, not least because both are literally (and literarily) laugh-out-loud funny. He - for he is a he, unlike our author who is a she - has written a book called, yes, you've guessed it: The Quiddity of Will Self - the literary equivalent of Being John Malkovich which, he explains to the real Will Self in a letter, \"aims to be a bizarre comedy, a murder mystery and a sincere homage to you and your work\".Obviously there's some sex and drugs along the way.Quirky and distinctly contortuplicated, this novel is so tricksy it comes up behind you, taps you on your right shoulder, then whispers \"boo!\" into your left ear, while wearing sinister masks on each of several scary faces. Full of words that jangle in your head, The Quiddity of Will Self is a dangerous odyssey through a cloudy mind - but whose? I'm not even sure how many Will Self's there were. I just hope the paranoia that pervades this novel isn't infectious.Why are you looking at me like that?What?"}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3145939-ellie", "userReview": "When Richard finds his neighbour dead, surrounded by images of Will Self, little does he know how his life is going to change. He's attempting to write a novel but his anti-pyschotic drugs are dampening his mind. He remembers a card that fell from Sylvie's pocket last time he saw her and follows the clue to discover a cult that worships Will Self.The prologue is incredibly random but made me smile in a word geek kind of way. After Richard discovers Will Self, his narrative starts to imitate him and I think the use of unusual words is a little over done. However we are not stuck with one narrative and I do wonder if those that slated the book read the whole thing. Richard reveals quite early on that he is taking clozapine, a drug used to treat schizophrenia, so you start to wonder whether it's all one big hallucination.The narrative then skips to Sylvie's ghost who is haunting Will Self. Then we go back to a diary written by Richard after a certain event has happened. The we skip to the future and we wonder if we are reading a book within a book within a book...and so on. I really quite liked the future part where Mia stumbles upon what could be a conspiracy. Where religions based on writers is the norm and instead of book to movie adaptations there's book to crime. Then finally the narration passes onto the author, but a different, fictional version. It's all a bit surreal and there are times when I had to stop reading because I felt I was losing my sanity a little.It seems to be a homage to Will Self. I haven't read any of his novels but I know enough about him to see his quiddity in the book. Quiddity being the essence of something, the defining features. I quite like the word and it is used quite a bit, probably more skilfully than some of the \u201cbig words\u201d that are thrown around (or sesquipedalian to use the preferred term). It does however raise the questions of the evolution of language and how the world is becoming dumbed down. The cult itself is reminiscent of Eyes Wide Shut.If you like unconventional narrative structure or are a fan of Will Self, give it a go. It's certainly going to be a Marmite book, although unlike the yeast extract (hate) I am sat on the fence. There were bits I loved and some that were just too much. The characters go on about their genitalia a bit too much (I believe this is a Self thing) and I found myself tiring of their literary aspirations."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8110116-jason", "userReview": "It seems from the average star rating that Ms(?) Mills is receiving a less than enthusiastic response to her unorthodox self-examining novel (forgive me). In defence and support:1) The book reminds us there are more than a thousand words in the English language, with good reason. Indeed, conjoined in non-quotidian clusters, words can prompt arising - even arousing - thoughts.2) The book examines and comments upon salient social, cultural and personal issues, more often than not pertinent to our (so-called) evolution as a species. 3) It does the above with originality, wit and even tenderness and at no point did I find it boring, obvious or mundane.4) It is a brave work, even if it didn't always quite work for me.5) It made me think.On the downside, there was a lot of cock between the pages.

I never wish to read an actual Will Self novel.)"}, {"userName": "Thom", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15302915-thom", "userReview": "Quiddity, from the Latin quidditas, describes the 'whatness' of a being or object. The quiddity of Sam Mills's novel is a heady commixture of sesquipedalian loquaciousness and meta-textual post-modernist tropes. The reader may be swept up in a Joycean feast of language, or engaged in a Sisyphean trudge from novel to dictionary and back.Everything about \u2018The Quiddity of Will Self\u2019 screams cult classic; the clever presentation, the subtle media references to the real life \u2018Will Self Club\u2019 inaugurated by Sam Mills, the sense of being a sect within a sect. Like Will Self\u2019s best novels, clever ideas are presented in an accessible and entertaining manner, once you get beyond the grandiloquent linguistic flourishes of the text. It is extremely hard to pin the novel down, however.Superficially, The Quiddity of Will Self is a story about obsession, a tribute in the style of Being John Malkovich to Britain\u2019s chief purveyor of multi-syllabic portentous prose. The storyline is divided into five sections; the first is a relatively simple crime novel set-up; a young woman is discovered dead in her flat by a male acquaintance, Richard, who becomes prime suspect. The twist is that the woman was undergoing surgery to turn her into the author of Great Apes and Dorian. Richard is drawn into the investigation, and thence into a shadowy underworld of literary self-publicists and the \u2018Will Self Club\u2019, a sect of devotees who attend the words of Will with a religious reverence. The text makes repeated reference to Raymond Chandler, but another comparison would be Perec\u2019s \u2018A Void\u2019, which also takes a murder mystery as the basis for an experimental foray into linguistics and literature. There is a similar sense of a writer being intoxicated with their own verbosity, revelling in the task they have set themselves.From here, we move into less familiar climes. A psychiatrist (Professor Self) attempts to cure criminals by infusing them with the \u2018quiddity\u2019 of various writers, drawn from DNA samples; a lesbian journalist from the future (Mia) attempts to trace the true history of the Will Self Club; a fictional Sam Mills, male this time, narrates the final section from present day Manchester, describing \u2018his\u2019 travails at getting \u2018Quiddity\u2026\u2019 published. Throughout, characters quote earlier sections of the book, and reference Self\u2019s novels and characters.Such an eclectic novel has inevitable problems, and some sections are stronger than others. I found the mid parts of the book to be the most engagingly fecund, with Professor Self\u2019s attempts to distil the unique characters of his favourite authors, and Mia\u2019s dystopian society, plagued by \u2018tropicsmog\u2019 and product placement. Others may find the more self-consciously artistic images (\u2018Sam Mills\u2019 being fellated by a young woman wearing a plastic Will Self mask) to be somewhat irksome. The preponderance of rape imagery is also a little disconcerting.\u2018The Quiddity of Will Self\u2019 is a bewildering swirl of ideas, and as such it is extremely difficult to get a handle on. At times, the sheer number of devices employed means that sections are necessarily underdeveloped. On one level, this is a novel about novels; the prologue alone references everyone from Jilly Cooper to Roland Barthes, as well as the ubiquitous Self. For me, this goes beyond simple name-checking, and transforms Quiddity into a Breaking Open the Head style exploration of the transforming potential of great writing, with Self as modern-day Shaman and spirit guide. It has been said that certain authors can never be the same after a character has inhabited their psyche; for Mills, this seems to go further, applying equally to the reader \u2013 the novels of Will Self have taken her through the looking glass, as the drug yage does for certain seekers of enlightenment.Enjoyment of the book will come down to the preferences of the individual \u2013 if phrases like \u2018meta-textual\u2019 and \u2018trope\u2019 get your goat, then this series of texts within texts, perfidious narrators and pop culture references will doubtless drive you up the wall. If, on the other hand, you\u2019re fond of a postmodern jape on the lines of Perec or the films of Spike Jonze, then this is an enjoyable romp. There seems to be a genuine, uncynical enthusiasm to the writing, and the sense of an author rushing to keep up with a flow of ideas is infectious. If nothing else, I am very fond of the idea of the rogue book clubs, re-enacting the crimes of their anti-heroes from Hannibal Lecter to the Poirot series, and fanning themselves with torn out pages of text during their orgiastic rites.Whilst there isn\u2019t a great deal that is original about \u2018The Quiddity of Will Self\u2019, as \u2018Sam Mills\u2019 \u2018himself\u2019 acknowledges, there are unlikely to be many books like this published during 2012. As historical fiction and straightforward crime novels dominate prize longlists, it is great to see an author wrestling with dystopias and social engineering. The novel will appeal to literary obsessives, who will warm to the theme of fandom taken to excess, and reading as a workable alternative to psychoactive drugs.\u2018The Quiddity of Will Self\u2019 is an intoxicating swirl of ideas, a disturbing adventure in the literal psychogeography of the great man\u2019s mind, a provocative and elusive literary adventure \u2013 its flaws are worn as badges, defying contradiction."}, {"userName": "David Hebblethwaite", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2104529-david-hebblethwaite", "userReview": "The quiddity of something is its \u2018whatness\u2019, the essential aspects which it shares with other things. This contrasts (we learn in Sam Mills\u2019s first novel for adults) with haecceity, which is a thing\u2019s \u2018thisness\u2019, the essential characteristics which make it particular. With that in mind, I\u2019d say that the world could do with more novels which have the quiddity of The Quiddity of Will Self; not to mention more novels with equivalent haecceity to The Quiddity of Will Self.Still with me? Excellent \u2013 let\u2019s go!We start in 2006: a young middle-class layabout named Richatd Smith strikes up a conversation with Sylvie Pettersson, his downstairs neighbour; afterwards, he finds a card which has fallen from her pocket. A week later, Richard decides to return the card \u2013 and discovers a man\u2019s body in Sylvie\u2019s flat. It turns out, though, that the body was Sylvie\u2019s \u2013 she had been undergoing plastic surgery to change her appearance to that of Will Self. Following a lead on the card he found, Richard finds himself becoming drawn into the strange world of the WSC, a clique of writers with a Will Self fixation, and a penchant for bizarre masked gatherings.In the subsequent four sections of the novel, we meet Sylvie\u2019s ghost, frustratedly searching for her killer; Richard Smith a year later, when he\u2019s won the opportunity to follow in Will Self\u2019s footsteps by writing in public in a tower block (though more sinister forces are at work than he realises); Mia, a journalist in 2049, who wonders whether the octogenarian Self\u2019s recent death was as straightforward as it appeared; and a present-day writer named Sam Mills working on a novel called The Quiddity of Will Self \u2013 but it\u2019s a different Sam Mills\u2026I won\u2019t pretend to have understood everything Mills is trying to achieve in her novel, nor all the ways in which it\u2019s in dialogue with Will Self\u2019s work \u2013 but I found Quiddity a rewarding and intriguing read nonetheless. Themes of identity and obsession reverberate through the book, and the shape of the narrative is especially interesting: each section brings into question the integrity of the previous one, and the story collapses in on itself repeatedly \u2013 so, whenever you think you have a handle on it, something will soon be along to change that.Reading The Quiddity of Will Self made me think of Leo Benedictus\u2019s Prospect article on \u2018hindered narrators\u2019 from a couple of months ago. To my mind, Benedictus conflates a few ideas which don\u2019t quite sit together comfortably; but what particularly interests me here is the contrast between narrators \u2018with a limited ability to understand the world or write about it\u2019 (which concept shades into narrators with idiosyncratic voices); and those who speak with the Voice of the Author, whatever the character\u2019s name happens to be. It seems to me that the narrators in Mills\u2019s novel (though not necessarily powerless or inarticulate) are all hindered narrators (in that there are fundamental aspects of their world about which they don\u2019t know \u2013 but which we, as readers, do); and that Will Self represents the Great Literary Author with the all-encompassing voice \u2013 so the characters\u2019 interest in Self may be read as a search for understanding and mastery of the world (in whatever sense).It\u2019s perhaps difficult to describe The Quiddity of Will Self in a way that doesn\u2019t make it sound like a curio which will only be of interest to lovers of Self\u2019s work \u2013 but I do think the book is more than that. It reminds me a little of Christopher Priest\u2019s The Islanders, in the sense that the shape of the novel is important for its own sake; but there\u2019s so much going on, and the energy of the narrative so great, that one can\u2019t help being swept along.There should be more books like The Quiddity of Will Self. There should also be more books which are nothing like The Quiddity of Will Self \u2013 preferably the same ones."}, {"userName": "J.F.

Self's spirit and style, cleverly parodied in the opening section as the increasingly deranged Richard Smith becomes obsessed with Self and the apparently sinister Will Self Club and merges his fractured identity with that of the famous writer; and many of Self's concerns - the nature of language and its limits, the problem of creating narrative fiction commensurate with the complexities of contemporary life, the magical spaces opened up in the imagination by psychogeography, psychiatry's will-to-power and the meaning of mental illness, and, of course, drugs - inform this twistedly funny and touchingly poignant story of confused identities, of mercurial spirits who reflect and refract each others' personalities.The basics of the story are this. Richard Smith is a struggling would-be writer dealing with mental illness who falls down the rabbit-hole into the world of The Will Self Club, a group of young decadent writers, a literary equivalent of the YBAs, who create a religion based on the worship of Will Self. There is a murder plot, an achingly sad ghost story in which the murder victim, Sylvie, also obsessed with Self, flies in through his window and enters his manuscript as he writes The Book of Dave. A love story with a sad ending, set some forty years after the murder of Sylvie and the breakdown of Richard Smith, is also a teasing mystery plot, a near-future dystopia and a dark psychedelic thriller. The most comic postmodernist swerve, in the spirit of Joyce, Vonnegut and Amis jr, is the final section, in which a fictionalised male version of Sam Mills (the real one is female, but she explores all kinds of genderbending and polymorphously perverse possibilities in comedically trippy fantasy mode) meets a sexy succubus at a book reading and finds his essence, his quiddity, is gradually sapped as she exchanges cosmically stupendous blow jobs for critical appraisal of her novel-in-progess.So this is a unique novel in that it takes the idea of creating a fictional version of a real-life individual but goes even farther than say JG Ballard did with Elizabeth Taylor in Crash or Self himself did with various literary figures in Walking to Hollywood, to produce something outrageously funny and kinkily otherworldly, much in the style of the book's inspiration Himself. (There is even a series of emails to Self sent by Mills to ask his blessing for the project. Apparently the real Sam Mills did this and Mr Self generously gave his non-litigious approval. So he appears as a shamanistic spirit-god, his 'real' self and as an electronic communication. Such onotological twists and turns!)The Quiddity of Will Self made me laugh and think and feel, kept me entertained to the fullest extent, and decided me to look out for more of Sam Mills's work in the future.

The attempt to explore Mia's relationship with her father and her chance but lasting encounetr with Kat could have been developed a little further for me. That said there is so much more I could understand about the book if I I had read Will Self, the character central to the surreal action. Should I have to to get the multiple layers?

He discovers that Sylvie was a member of the W.S.C. - a mysterious cult of charismatic writers who appear to worship Will Self in a strange and secret style. Gradually, he gets sucked into their dark world of absinthe, cloaks and bizarre Initiation rites. Richard begins to lose his sense of perspective. What is the WSC and what is their relationship to the mysterious Hemingway potions? What did they do to Sylvie... and what will they do to him? Ranging from the present day to 2049, from dictionary rape to literary orgies, from lesbian book reviewers to the Great Vowel Shift, The Will Self Murders is a quirky, comic novel, reminiscent of Being John Malkovich - with the acclaimed novelist, Will Self, as the centre of fascination.", "title": "The Quiddity of Will Self", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12359412-the-quiddity-of-will-self", "average": 3.42, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328745576l/12359412.jpg", "reviews": 22, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/704966.Sam_Mills", "name": "Sam Mills"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Novels", "Abandoned"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12359412-the-quiddity-of-will-self", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16619693-the-quiddity-of-will-self", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17356651-the-quiddity-of-will-self-sam-mills", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7953850-blackout", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1824833.A_Nicer_Way_To_Die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2498675.The_Viper_Within", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6024464-the-boys-who-saved-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8152619-the-money-tree"]}
