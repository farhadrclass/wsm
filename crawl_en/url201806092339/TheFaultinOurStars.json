You can't post that on Goodreads. Me: *glares* Why not? A voice in my head (aka VH): Please, don't. You will ruin your reputation. Me: *weary* Not that again. VH: Well, it's true. You can't post that. It's just not okay. Do you have any idea how popular this book is? Hint : YOU CAN'T EVEN GUESS.Me: Why should I care? Maybe some people think like me.VH: You don't understand. It's not just random book that you can critize like you do all the time and just get away with it. This is THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. And it's John Green. Believe me, you do NOT want to get in the way of those crazy fans, nerdfighters or whatever it is they call themselves. Me: Really, what the fuck do I care? I want to give this 3 stars. It's not like I'm giving it 1 star or something. VH: But why would you even do that in the first place? EVERYONE, and I do mean EVERYONE in your friend list gave it 5 stars. And they used so many sobbing gifs! Really, it made me cry a little just looking at them. Me: *stares*VH: It won the Goodreads award for best YA!Me: So? Fifty Shades won Best Romance. VH: It's got one of the highest general ratings for a book on Goodreads!Me: Nobody but the Goodreads community actually cares. And wait. I'm not even sure the Goodreads community actually cares. I know I don't.VH: You're such a cold-hearted bitch. Why would you give it only 3 stars anyway? Don't you have a heart? And why 3 stars? I know you really loved the book, deep down! Me: I didn't. I mean, I liked it, it was okay... but I didn't love it. It's... I mean... Oh, fuck it. It's overrated. There! I said it. Sue me. VH: *seethes* You did NOT just say that. Me : I did. Because it is! Come on, did you read the dialogues in this? Can we talk about the dialogues? I want to talk about the dialogues.VH: *crosses arms* Go ahead. I want examples.Me: Fine. I'll start with the popular quotes. You know what I'm talking about. The quotes which are totally overrated and everyone loves them and they create pics and stuff when really, if you think about the quote in itself.. Well, you realize that it just, you know, sucks. VH: *mumbles* How 'bout: you suck?Me: What was that? Actually, forget it, I don't give a shit. Listen to this! \u201cMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.\u201d\nVH: So? It's beautiful.Me: Well...*tries really hard to refrain from laughing* I mean... Seriously? Like... *fails miserably* HAHAHAHA how more pretentious can you get? Comparing your thoughts to stars? REALLY?VH: You're so shallow. Some of us have deep thoughts, you know. Like, thoughts so deep they actually deserve to be compared to the firmament. I don't even want to explain to you how poetic this is, because I'd waste my time. Me: Save yourself the effort, I don't mind. And I've got another example. Probably my favorite.\"That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.\"\nVH: What now? You're gonna say that it's so pretentious it made you cry?Me: Precisely. *nods wisely* Because that's the thing about tears. They demand to be wet. Or that's the thing about food. It demands to be eaten. Or that's the thing about...VH: SHUT UP, I get it! There's no discussion with you. How am I supposed to discuss with someone who's got the intellectual depth of an empty oyster?Me: But come on, I'm not finished yet. What about Augustus and his unlit cigarette?\u201cThey don\u2019t kill you unless you light them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never lit one. It\u2019s a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don\u2019t give it the power to do its killing.\u201d\nMe: Is this supposed to be smart? This is pathetic. It's terrible, it's not funny, and it's not deep. VH: *hisses* It's a metaphor!Me: I know!\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d I said, dubious. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d he said.\u201cYou choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances...\u201d I said.\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace.\u201d\nMe: Can you say metaphor again? Say metaphor one more time! Go ahead, say it, I think John Green hasn't totally forced it down my throat yet! *hysterical yelling* LET'S SAY IT AGAIN! Metaphor! Everything is a METAPHOR!VH: What's your point, you freak?Me: My point is, the dialogues are horrible. It made my eyes burn. It's pretentious and unbelievable, AND besides, you can totally see that John Green loves the characters.VH: What author doesn't like the characters of their own book?Me: It's not the same! With John Green... It's like he adores himself. I bet you anything he re-reads his own books. Just to see exactly how awesome they are. VH: What? You don't know that. You cannot possibly say that. How dare you talk about him like you know him.Me: You know, in the audio version of The Fault in Our Stars, at the end, there's an interview with him. And he explicitly says that he just LOVES listening to the audio versions of his books. So there.VH: What? No. You're wrong. He doesn't mean, like, he loves it when someone reads him his own books. That's not what he meant AT ALL. It's a misunderstanding. What he meant was, he loves listening to the.. the.. reading lady. Because she has such a sweet voice and everything. Me: Are you kidding me? He's in love with himself! Augustus is just an hologram. An empty shell. Seriously, his monologues are laughable. I couldn't even focus. I kept thinking of John Green while reading. Because Augustus is just SO witty, so smart, so perfect. *cough cough* wish fulfillment hello.VH: I am so not convinced.Me: There's this whole repetition thing, too. I cannot believe how all the characters of his books look alike. How come it works every SINGLE time? How many books are out there, now? 4? 5? More, surely. It's always the SAME THING. Geeky and nerdy narrator, geekier and nerdier sidekick, mysterious but unbelievable girl, random plot that doesn't even make sense, road trip. Come the fuck on. You know what? The fact that people aren't getting tired of him and his stupid same characters is the real question.VH: But this book is unique. The way it deals with cancer and death... It's so beautiful. You cannot possibly say it isn't.Me: That's what disturbed me the most. Look. What I want to say is, not every death is glorious. Not every death is epic and not every death will glow like a star in the eternal twilight sky. Most of the time, deaths are random, plain, and the world is cold and uncaring, and that's how it is. And that's what's terrible. You don't need to be a hero, you don't need to defy death the way Augustus pretends to, you don't need to lose yourself in unbelievable speeches to have people cry over your death. The book is just TOO much. VH: You know, about them being unbelievable when they talk? You seem to forget something. Augustus and Hazel ARE different. They're unique, so they talk different. That's what it's all about.Me: They're not different, they don't exist. They can't exist. Honestly? I don't think this was a good tribute to the kids who are really sick. Because no one talks like that, NO ONE, and I feel like now there's this messed-up hierarchy between the sick kids who are sort of smart ass and those who aren't. And I refuse that. I can't accept that. Being ironic, jaded, detached and all metaphorical over the disease is a luxury that genuinely sick teenagers cannot afford. So fuck this. And I'd rather kneel before a kid who has cancer and who doesn't know what a metaphor is than shed a tear over one of Augustus's stupid monologues.VH: You liar, I know you cried while you read the book. You were a sobbing mess.Me: I wasn't. I was a sobbing mess at the end of Before I Die. And oh my God, I couldn't even speak after I finished A Monster Calls because I was crying so hard. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl had me in tears, too. These are all gorgeous books that deal with cancer. And I cried like a bitch every single time, and they broke my heart. But this? I didn't cry.VH: You did, and you know it. Especially at THIS special moment.Me: *looks away* I don't know what you're talking about.VH : You cried when Hazel asked her mom if she would still be a mom after her death.Me: Fine, okay. I cried. I know. Okay? I know. But look. That's precisely the point. That's what I call emotional blackmail. Because I DARE YOU not to cry over that discussion. Because it's a universal fear! Whether you're a mom, or a daughter, or both, if you have a sister even, you must have thought about that already and told yourself : Okay, if I die, or if she dies. Who will I be? If my sister dies and I'm asked whether I have a sibling, what should I say? Am I still a sister because she existed, once? Or if you have a child, and then one day your baby dies. What happens then? Are you still a parent? Are you still a parent because once, you used to be a parent, and because there's a room upstairs that used to be your child's? I dare you to think about it and not end up crying. I took it as a betrayal from John Green because I feel like he didn't play fair. OF COURSE talking about a child's death in this peculiar way will make the reader cry! But it's so easy. It doesn't require any talent. Just ask anyone to talk about that and they'll be tearing up in 5 seconds! Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I feel like he was like, \"I'm gonna make them cry.\" and all the while I was reading I swear I could hear him: \"ARE YOU SAD YET? ARE YOU HEARTBROKEN YET? DO YOU SEE HOW INCREDIBLY UPSETTING MY STORY IS? I KNOW, RIGHT. I AMAZE MYSELF SOMETIMES.\"VH: But--Me: No, look. Writing like that, it's not incredible, it's not magical and it's not valuable. It's playing with people's weaknesses. It's manipulating people into crying. And I can't respect him with that the way I respect people who manage to make me cry without using such poor plot devices. Like in, Me and Earl and The Dying Girl. There's a cancer book that really took me by surprise. Because, Rachel, the sick girl, is everything but admirable. She's young, a bit shallow, nice, shy, plain, normal, really. And her neighbor who befriends her, he doesn't fall in love with her. And her death won't be remembered like something that scarred humanity, because it didn't. Ultimately, it didn't even matter at all. And I could relate more easily to that, to the meaningless dimension of her death, to the emptiness of it all, more than I could ever relate to the ridiculous speeches of Augustus (and Hazel's too, for that matter). Because you know what bothered me, too? They're indistinct. VH: That's because they're soul mates. That's the whole point of the book. They found themselves in each other.Me: It doesn't work to say they're soul mates. Look, I read the book almost a year ago, I think. And this:\u201cI\u2019m in love with you, and I\u2019m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I\u2019m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we\u2019re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we\u2019ll ever have, and I am in love with you.\u201d\nMe: This is beautiful, granted. It's also unrealistic that a teenager would ever say that, let alone improvize it, but whatever, it's pretty. But the thing is, I am completely unable to say whether it's Augustus or Hazel who says that. I don't know. I have no idea. I try to recognize the style, but I can't tell, BECAUSE THEY TALK EXACTLY THE SAME.VH: ...Me: So yeah. I didn't love the book, and I am not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things; I didn't love the book, and I know this review might be just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed to another John Green book about an unbelievable loser and his even more loser sidekick loving an unbelievable teenage girl, and that there will come a day when maybe he will change his writing formula, and maybe that'll come when the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, but then it'll be too late, so who cares? I didn't love this book.VH: *suspiciously silent*Me: Are we done?VH: FINE. Ugh.

Let's take a moment and consider all the implications of that, and why he is making a colossal understatement when he described the experience as \"devastating.\" That was about twelve years ago, and Green has said in interviews that because of this experience, he's spent twelve years trying to write a book about kids with cancer - not poster children of strength and courage and illness-granted wisdom, but real kids and their families and friends who have to cope with the fact that they will die young. All novels are personal, but Green's novels seem, to me, to be especially so. But this one is personal in a different way. With this novel, Green isn't trying to exorcize the memory of the girl who stomped on his heart in high school. This goes deeper than high school romance and Manic Pixie Dream Girl angst. This is about life, death, illness, love, heroism, and how a sixteen-year-old is supposed to deal with the fact that she will die and leave everyone she loves behind. Maybe it's just because I've been watching vlogbrothers videos for four years and feel like I'm actually acquainted with John Green, but this is the most deeply personal novel I've ever read. This is not, as Hazel Lancaster might say, a Cancer Book. None of the cancer patients in this story have a wisdom beyond their years, and they do not stoically accept the fact that they will die or fight heroically. Hazel Lancaster, a terminal sixteen-year-old who has to carry an oxygen tank everywhere because \"my lungs suck at being lungs\" is refreshingly real - not manic, not a pixie, not a dream girl. She reads Great Books and watches America's Next Top Model marathons. Augustus Waters, her amputee friend, wants desperately to leave a lasting impression on the world and philosophizes about heroism, and his favorite book is a novelization of a video game. (can I say how much I love that an author can establish a character's intelligence without telling us that they love reading Austen yes Stephenie Meyer I'm looking at you) Everything here is real, especially the diseases. There isn't any bullshit about dying gracefully here, because cancer is ugly and unpleasant, and Green makes you feel Hazel's lungs struggling to breathe and the pain, and see the vomit and urine. (Remember how in A Walk to Remember, Mandy Moore has been secretly dying of leukemia the whole time but looks great even on her deathbed? Nicholas Sparks can fuck right off for that insult to real cancer patients) Most importantly, Hazel and Augustus are not defined by their cancer. It consumes their lives, but it doesn't define them. On every page, it's clear: this is a story told by someone who hasn't known just one person with cancer, but has seen a multitude of children with terminal diseases, and has tried to find some way to comfort them and their families. It's for that reason that I don't feel like I can review this like a normal book. John Green didn't write this story for me, and so I don't feel like I have any place saying that it's amazing and beautiful and heartbreaking. And I certainly can't criticize any of its minor faults. All I can say, really, is that you have to read this for yourself, and go from there. ...Okay, you guys know me better than that. I have one big complaint, which I will describe here, and all I ask is that you remember that I still gave this five stars. Augustus Waters, in the first few chapters, comes off as a pretentious douche. When Hazel first meets him at a cancer support group, they're talking afterwards and Augustus takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. Hazel, who you'll recall is dying because her lungs cannot function, freaks out: \"...even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER.\" Augustus explains that he doesn't smoke the cigarettes, he just puts them in his mouth (no, really) because \"They don't kill you unless you light them...And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: you put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing.\" Augustus, I love you, but you're full of shit right there. Notice how he didn't address Hazel's perfectly valid point that, by buying cigarettes, Augustus is giving money to the people who cause cancer? Because here's the thing: you can say to a cigarette company, \"I'm buying your cigarettes as a metaphor, but I won't light them so I'm taking away their power\" and they'll stop listening at \"I'm buying your cigarettes\" because that's all they care about. And it's a shit metaphor in any case: you can walk around a mall with a shotgun and explain to people that because it's unloaded you've taken away its power, but you're still going to get arrested. So that was annoying, as was Augustus's general air of overly-charming pretentious skeeziness in the beginning. But I forgive him for it, because lest we forget, he is seventeen. If his character was twenty-two he'd be the most obnoxious jackass on the planet, but because he's just a kid, I was willing to forgive him. Still hate the cigarette thing, though."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "It seems silly that I have to say this, but I've seen many a negative review of this book met with backlash from John's nerdfighter fans, so I want to make one thing clear: I like John Green. You'll find plenty who worship him as a god amongst men and many who are highly critical of him, I fall into neither of these categories but I do like him and I enjoy watching his videos. I find him funny and I agree with a lot of what he stands for; I also appreciate the amount of charity work he does and the way he helps the \"nerds\" feel better about themselves and make it out of high school a little less scarred than they might have been. I like John Green. But I do not particularly like this book. There are plenty of people raving about this book on goodreads, on Kirkus, in various magazines and newspapers... so I realise I am in a tiny minority. I will also admit that I might not have felt the same if I hadn't already subjected myself to numerous \"cancer books\" but, as it is, I do not feel anything that unique or interesting has been brought to the table here. For the first half (approx), despite my lack of enthusiasm, I expected to give it three stars because I didn't consider it to be a bad book and it was well-written enough; however, as the book wore on, I began to realise that I was growing more and more bored and found myself struggling to read on. This was something I hadn't anticipated. I'd prepared myself for many different possibilities: heartbreak, a changed perspective on life and death, disdain, annoyance... but not bored indifference. Hence the lower rating.One of the first problems I encountered was that the kids were wise beyond their years. And I don't mean intelligent, I mean wise. They came out with things that really only suit people who've been alive a few centuries - like Dumbledore or Gandalf - or at the very least people who are sat comfortably in middle age. I like that Green doesn't patronise his readers by oversimplifying things or dumbing down characters in a condescending effort to appeal to teenagers, but these characters behave in a way that is unnatural to the point where sometimes it is verging on ridiculous. It's not completely unbelievable that some kids exist who are actually like this, but they definitely don't all speak and behave in this way.The characters are all, in one way or another, John Green. They all have his quirkiness, his sense of humour; I was picturing several John Greens sat around having a conversation while I was reading The Fault in Our Stars. In fact, reading this book was a little bit like watching one of Green's vlogs, which might have worked well if JG hadn't dampened the humour with philosophical musings. As it was, I had a book that was trying so very hard to be both funny and sad at the same time and ended up failing to deliver either one as successfully as I would have liked. The dialogue felt false and scripted because of the teens' tendency to showcase their depth and intelligence. Natural conversation between anyone of any age doesn't work like this and I couldn't shake the feeling that there should be a laughter track playing in the background.The Fault in Our Stars, in my opinion, would have been far better if Green had stuck to humour like Andrews did in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. I believe that the exaggerated characters and their unrealistic conversations would have been fine in a straight-up humour book because that's not supposed to portray something real and deep and moving. But Green loses it by trying to be philosophical and, in the end, I think he has produced a book that is as melodramatic and message-driven as any other on this issue. And his attempt to balance humour and sadness left me somewhat devoid of emotion throughout and provided fewer laughs than I'd hoped.Ultimately, I feel that JG sacrificed humour in order to be deep and philosophical - perhaps this book tried to be too many things, perhaps JG tried to be too clever. But Me and Earl and the Dying Girl was a much better book, in my opinion, because it did the whole serious illness + humour thing but didn't over-complicate things by being philosophical. Like I said near the beginning, perhaps I am just tired of these books and The Fault in Our Stars needs to be appreciated by someone who has not already exhausted themselves on similar efforts.

This is perhaps the most personal review I have written. My choice of stars was difficult for this. I am a self confessed John Green fan, I believe he is amongst the best of, not only YA, but fiction writers out there in general. This is a beautifully written book. There is very little to complain about in terms of style, plot, character, etc. However I couldn't, in all good conscience, give this any higher because it sits so badly with me. I have let this novel marinate for a couple of days now before writing this, and I just keep coming back to the same issues. Namely:Was this John Green's story to tell?It is the human condition to attempt to find hope in hopeless situations. But let me attempt to explain how watching a 17 year old fade away truly feels. Because when the wit and words are stripped away I am not sure John did that.It is endless. It is an unavoidable and uncontrollable and an all encompassing darkness where no hope or life or explanations exist.There are absolutely no life lessons to be gained from watching a 17 year old cease to exist. There is no comfort. The lessons that some may claim you can achieve through the darkest night of the soul reveal most of humanity for the selfish, narcissistic beings we are.I have come to believe there is a special kind of cruelty behind the perfectly cross stitched 'encouragement'. Those things are for the ones left over trying to make sense of the senseless.Whilst I believe this novel acknowledges that. It tries not to, as the main protagonists claimed theirselves, set the victims of disease up as typical heroic, worldly wise characters, it still reads like a novel attempting to bring equilibrium out of disaster. The victims ultimately still are wise beyond their years. This, it seems, is an assumed side effect of a teenager coming to terms with their mortality. They use metaphors and pretentious poetry and a sharp wit and are wholly unbelievable as real life teenagers. They are constructs of an ideal. They are the literary version of Dawson's Creek, using SAT vocabulary and existential navel gazing, whilst simultaneously slamming the typical genre for using its characters to do the same.Having lived this first hand; once with a brother who ceases to exist at 17 and a second time with a brother who is currently 2 years NEC. I am all too familiar with the need for light hearted humour at what may feel like the most inappropriate of times. But what differs from that and attempting to write a disease ridden novel that attempts to make you laugh, is apparently personal experience. I have the right to sit around a Christmas table laughing somewhat hysterically at nothing. My living brother has the right to crack UNO-ball jokes whenever the opportunity arises. But none of the readers of this novel who have not experienced the kind of loss depicted here have a right to laugh at any of it. You can not claim it as your own unless it is yours, and in my mind that is what humour does. It is not appropriate for me to laugh along with eye jokes and blind jokes, because they are not my jokes. I am merely a voyeur in another persons tragedy, I lay no claim to having the understanding of the experience necessary to allow for laughter.Again, let me make clear. I can not approach this book outside of my personal experience. Of course in reality I do not believe you have to have experienced everything to laugh at a joke. But in terms of purposefully trying to create humour in a novel that is fundamentally tragic, for an audience that is mostly YA, I struggle with. I struggle with it because the empty platitudes that are trying so hard to be subverted in this novel, are still being created. It is still suggesting there can be lightness and humour within the terminally dark - and it is suggesting it to people who have never experienced the terminally dark.This read like a novel where the author has truly witnessed the emptiness of teenage terminal illness, and thankfully appears to have become more considerate and thoughtful for it. As opposed to erring on the side of platitudes.But it still read as a novel attempting to explain where the hope in hopeless situations are.Perhaps because it is too raw a subject for me, or perhaps because the novel really is sentimental and gratuitous (granted in a different way from the norm of this genre) but this is not a book I would recommend.For sufferers, for family members of sufferers, or for well meaning people seeking to understand the hopelessness of some situations. I would recommend it for none."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "As seen on The ReadventurerThe Fault in Our Stars currently has a rating of 4.74 on Goodreads, almost everyone I know has given it 5 stars, therefore I'm certain no one would want to read my sour musings, except me and maybe a couple of other like-minded and unimpressed.What I'd love to know is this - what makes a writer undertake the topic of cancer? So much has already been written about it, so many Lifetime movies filmed, so many tears shed. It literally has been done to death. What new did John Green have to bring to the cancer table?The way I see it, nothing. Having your terminally sick characters be ironic about their illnesses and swap cancer jokes isn't groundbreaking.The Fault in Our Stars isn't a bad book, but it's a standard cancer book, and, sadly, a standard John Green book, with standard John Green humor and standard John Green characters speaking in the very same John Green voice. You have a witty and intelligent protagonist (this time 2, Hazel and Augustus - a female and male versions of Miles/Quentin/Colin), a funny, slightly pathetic sidekick (Isaac - another version of Hassan/Chip/Marcus), a mysterious, unhinged girl, Gus's dead ex (Alaska/Margo clone), and, of course, the signature ROAD TRIP. I can't help but recognize these people and this plot, I've read all of Green's novels.I understand why so many readers would have such an emotional response to the book. Nothing will get the ladies crying quicker than a kid dying of cancer. Add in some long farewells, painkillers, eulogies and funerals - you can collect buckets of tears. But, IMO, here Green aims for the most obvious, the most easily accessible emotions, for the most typical \"life lessons.\" And for all Green's attempts to be subversive and to make fun of \"cancer cliches\" - inspirational quotes, heroic cancer survivors, etc. he ended up writing about exactly the same things. Frankly, I think The Fault in Our Stars is Green's weakest work to date, weaker even than half-baked Zombicorns. Because this, unlike his earlier works, feels commercial and intentionally tearjerky and insincere. It will probably sell the most copies."}, {"userName": "April*procrastinator and proud*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3073744-april-procrastinator-and-proud", "userReview": "This is me after I finished the book (and whenever I think about it).*pointless EDIT* Woooah! 1000+ likes!?

Do whatever you want.As much of an amazing writer as I want to be.... I'm really not. So I'll just point out the things that made this book amazing. ;)I knew that I would cry so I really didn't bother swearing not to cry. What I didn't expect is bawling my eyes out. I really didn't. John Green has done an amazing job of making these characters feel so real to me. When they cried, I cried (bawled). When they laughed, I laughed. When they melted, I melted. Their romance was so epic and I know, I KNOW, that this is a book I will read over and over again and cry every single time. The characters were perfection! Especially Augustus Waters. Not only is his name Augustus (which is epic in itself) He had the guts to go up to Hazel and just straight up ask her to come hang out with him. Nice guys finish last? I think not. You know this book was so awesmazing that I gave it its own tag. Just look up there and you'll see a little tag that says \"the-fault-in-our-stars\". It was THAT amazing. Seriously. So amazing that I'm pretty sure it was my first heartbreak... from a book. I really haven't felt that much from a book, much less a person, in a very long time.

Despite the huge number of ratings and the spectacular average rating, this book is not perfect. You might find it unrealistic, because if there are many of us who see the life and its complexity like Hazel and Gus do, this world will be such a happy place. So like any other book, this one also might be a miss or a hit. If it's a miss, then you can say it's not worth the hype. But if it's a hit, it hits hard.

What am I supposed to say? How can I do this book justice? Maybe tell you all that it was perfect? The best, most heartbreaking, hilarious book that has touched me like none other? Sure. I mean, it's been said countless times, in countless reviews, and you know what? They are absolutely, a hundred and fifty percent true.Hazel's days are numbered thanks to her crap lungs. She was able to buy a few years more, thanks to a miracle, but she isn't fooling herself. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten. I don't think I've ever cried so much, laughed so much, just over all enjoyed a book as much as I have while reading The Fault in Our Stars. Everything that goes on is serious, heartbreaking and eye opening but John Green does an amazing job at, literally, making you laugh out loud. Even when you're suffering. Hazel... what a breathe of fresh air her character was. She was real and I loved her no bullshit attitude. She wasn't fooling herself, and John Green didn't make her out to be ecstatic with the world or her situation. She wasn't bitchy or depressing, but it wasn't like she was perfectly fine to sit idly and watch the time tick by.Augustus Waters is my dream guy. Like, for real. As I wrote on an update: Screw all the Christian Grey\u2019s and the Gideon Cross\u2019, just give be Augustus Waters.\nAs he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.\nI fell in love with everything that was\u2026 him.I was completely emotionally invested into the story. It\u2019s not just the main characters that stole my heart, Isaac, the parents, even her damn tank, Phillip, did as well. It was beautiful, it was hilarious, and it was perfect.\n\"Maybe okay will be our always.\"\nEverybody tells you to have your tissues fully loaded because you\u2019re going to need them, and of course my first thought is suuuureee. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve teared up in plenty of books, but actually cried? Nah. Well, I step down and admit defeat. I freakin\u2019 sobbed my heart out.

You used Tearjerking 101, huh? You armed yourself with adorably precocious teenage characters delivering insanely quotable lines while dying from cancer, huh?Well, guess what - \n\"I'm not cryyyyying! It's just been raining on my face...\"\n And so my hard-won cool image of a cold-hearted cynic has been saved by this line, courtesy of New Zealand's 4th most popular guitar-based digi-bongo acapella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo:\nSeriously, book, you know that most heartstrings cannot resist being tugged on in this fashion, especially when you are using kids who are off the charts on the precocious cuteness scale with all their precocious irony, precocious sarcasm, precocious world-weariness and precocious vocabulary.Are you tired of reading the word 'precocious' yet? Too bad, since adorable and fragile precociousness is at the 'literal heart' of this book. That's what alienated some readers - but I'm a sucker for precociousness in literature; guilty, your Honor!------Like with any literature, what you get out of this book varies based on how you choose to interpret it. You can see it as a shameless use of a serious medical condition in children in order to make money and get recognition (because it's kids dying from cancer, c'mon!)Cancer in kids has been used as a tearjerker before. Google 'TV tropes Littlest Cancer Patient', please. Here, I will save you the trouble.You can see it as a cutesy young adult love story. You can see it as a collection of quotable lines clearly put into the speech of teens by the middle-aged author. You can see it as yet another coming-of-age novel (there's even a requisite trip/adventure in there, really). You can even see it as a book trying really hard to NOT be a stereotypical 'cancer book' - to the point where characters are stating so at length.And you know what? All these are to some extent true.But what I got out of it, what made me tear up a bit was the motif of fragility of life as seen by the children who have a limited supply of that life, basically a limited 'infinity'. Reading it, I got a few flashbacks to Pediatric Oncology - the time in medical school when I realized that I'm not strong enough to be a pediatrician and see kids suffer and die. Hazel Lancaster and Augustus Waters are the two children with cancer. She has terminal thyroid cancer and is tethered to an oxygen tank; he falls victim to metastatic osteosarcoma (before you scream 'Spoiler!' in outrage, I sincerely ask you - how could you not have seen it coming?) They introduce themselves in their cancer support group by stating their diagnoses - and my heart breaks a little at the thought of children learning to define themselves by their disease. Even their favorite book is the cancer book. But no, \"I'm not cryyyying....\"\n\nThis is not a perfect book. It relies a little too heavily on tearjerking. Frequently, it gets to be a bit too full of itself, occasionally cringeworthy - sometimes to eye-rolling extent. But with the quotability factor and the smart precociousness still comes the real sadness and cuteness and feeling that clawed its way into my heart and made me love it despite the imperfections. Maybe I liked it because of associations and memories it brought with it rather than for its own merits - but hey, the emotions will stay with me for a while, whatever the reason for them may be. I think this book would have a huge appeal to teenagers, its intended audience. The characters are relatable, they are intelligent, and the male lead manages to transform from 'oh, rly, jerk?' to a considerate and lovely young man. The parents are present in the lives of both teens and are portrayed in a very sympathetic light; definitely no 'absent parent syndrome' here! Plus, it has a healthy portrayal of teenage sexuality, unlike what we frequently see in young adult literature.So great book? No. But I easily give it 3.75 stars and therefore rounding up to 4 stars (Is the fault in them? Go figure.)\n\u201cThe pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, because there was no longer anyone to remember with. It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself, as if the things we'd done were less real and important than they had been hours before.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "I\u2019m just going to sit here, write my review and pretend there aren\u2019t already 100 179 reviews for The Fault in Our Stars posted on this incredible online community.Let\u2019s start, shall we?First of all, I didn\u2019t cry. I know many of you did, and I can understand why, I really can. But, the thing is\u2026 this book has a balanced atmosphere. It\u2019s both sad and full of life. During my reading, I concentrated on the joyful parts and the humour. Maybe that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t feel crushed by the \u2018cancer\u2019 part. The number of times I laughed out loud or giggled are uncountable.Of course, there were some times when I felt my eyes burn because what happens in this book is not fair. Then again, is life ALWAYS fair for any of us? Hint: no.Hazel is such an honest main character. At first, I thought it was impossible she had cancer. Sometimes, I even forgot she had cancer! She accepts it and I began to accept it as well. I rarely read books with diseases or heavy subjects in fact, so loving this book wasn\u2019t in my pre-read expectations. BUT, I DID.OH, I DID.Will I re-read this book?YES, YES AND YES.I\u2019m not the queen of re-readings, I know a queen of re-readings and it\u2019s definitely not me. I\u2019m way too excited about newly released books or ones I\u2019m dying to read and haven\u2019t to take the time to re-read books. In fact, I think I only re-read 12 books in my entire life. And that was when I was younger and didn\u2019t know Goodreads existed, hehe.However, I know that, when I\u2019m going to re-read The Fault in Our Stars, I\u2019ll appreciate it even more than I do now, fall harder in love with Augustus and feel an even greater connection to Hazel. The originality of this book is beyond amazing. I kept thinking, ''how did John Green manage to invent all of that?'' He\u2019s a fantastic author with an impressive writing style and choice of words. I\u2019m so eager to read his other novels, in occurrence Looking for Alaska of which I heard only great things; it has a big amount of raving reviews.Hazel's family is adorable and full of love. She's so lucky to grow up surrounded by such comfortable and loving parents. I rarely see similar families in real life but they do exist so, yes, the story is also a believable one. Even the \u2018author\u2019 inside it feels real.In conclusion to this 100 180th review of The Fault in Our Stars, I recommend this novel to you with all my heart. I hope you\u2019ll love it as much as I did and find it inspiring and beautiful as well.Last updated: May 1st, 2016.BD | Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "Barry Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4593541-barry-pierce", "userReview": "I feel so sorry for these privileged, middle-class, white teenagers."}, {"userName": "Rosalinda *KRASNORADA*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12788865-rosalinda-krasnorada", "userReview": "FIVE OKAY & INFINITE STARS OKAY? OKAYThere are almost 33000 reviews of this book. Why do I try to write one? I just don\u2019t know but I do know that I have to let you know my thoughts about this AWESOME book.I love YA. Even if I take YA holidays sometimes and stop reading it I can\u2019t deny it\u2019s one of my fave genres. This book and Forbidden are probably my favourite YA books and right now I cannot decide which one is my absolute favourite. I knew about this book, I knew how it ended and I thought I couldn\u2019t read it because the story was kind of personal for me but I will talk about that after my review.This is the story of Hazel Grace & Augustus Water. Hazel has cancer and she meets Augustus at Support Group. They are ADORABLE. Hazel is the teen I always wanted to be: intelligent, funny, a great daughter and a very strong kid.\nThere is only one thing in this world shittier than biting it from cancer when you\u2019re sixteen, and that\u2019s having a kid who bites it from cancer\nAnd Augustus\u2026 well, he\u2019s just then teen boyfriend I always wanted to meet: charismatic, positive, funny, happy and a GREAT best friend.\n\u201dI enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence\u201d\nHazel Grace is just like us, she loves books and she specially loves her favourite book \u201cAn Imperial Affliction\u201d by Peter Van Houten who happens to be her best friend, but let\u2019s say this is a one-sided friendship. I also want a lot of authors to be my friends!She tells Augustus about the book and he obviously reads it because he would do ANYTHING for Hazel Grace.\n\u201dLove is keeping the promise anyway\u201d\nEnter Isaac, Augustus\u2019 best friend. He\u2019s the best friend I always wanted to have. A romantic, a fool romantic who has cancer in his eyes\u2026This book is about love, friendship, fight, hope and life. And about  infinites As I mentioned, Hazel is obsessed with Peter Van Houten. Apparently he never finished his book An Imperial Affliction so she decides to mail him asking for answers. Because as she said, authors shouldn\u2019t end their books if they\u2019re not finished, right? I am gonna do the same with some authors\u2026\nAnd of course, if you ever do decide to write anything else, even if you don\u2019t want to publish it, I\u2019d love to read it. Frankly, I\u2019d read your grocery list.\nI might have mentioned that to one of my favourite M/M authors. I am pathetic! The days go by and Hazel and Augustus cannot stay away from each other and their relationship is soooooo freaking sweet. OMG, I am in love with Augustus Waters, he\u2019s probably the BEST book boyfriend EVER.\n\u201dOh my God, stop flirting with me!. We both know that okay is a very flirty word. Okay is BURSTING with sensuality\u201d.\nI just loved how the author made me laugh so much. I mean, I was reading a book about kids with cancer, I wasn\u2019t supposed to be laughing but I did. I did because those damn characters camped in my heart and they are planning to stay there forever.\n\u201dIt would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you\u201d.\nAnd you feel you\u2019re discovering love for the first time with them all over again. Like true love, that kind of love that comes from a friendship. A love that is not based on how hot you are but how interesting you are. A love that is based in understanding each other, in accepting that we are grenades that can explode, in being there for each other no matter what.This is probably one of the best and most real love stories I\u2019ve ever read in my entire life. I will never EVER forget this book, I actually ordered the paperback as I need to smell the book, I need to hug Hazel and tell her she\u2019s my new best friend even if this is also a one-sided friendship. I need to tell Isaac that his special person is going to come to his life one day and he\u2019s gonna know what real love is.I need to hug Hazel\u2019s father and tell him I freaking LOVE him because he reminded me of my father. A lot of families should take Hazel\u2019s family as an example. You need to give love if you want to receive love and that\u2019s what this family did.\n\u201dThe world is not a wish-granting factory\u201d.\nAnd even if the world is not a wish granting factory you cannot stop believing that good things will come because they will. You just need to be positive and enjoy what you have, enjoy every single second with the people you love just like Hazel & Augustus did.\n\u201dYou don\u2019t get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.\u201d.\n***The below is not about the book, is about my life, you might not want to read it but I have to say this***That man on the picture was my best friend for almost 19 years, the man of my life, my half, the person who will be my example until the last day of my life. The person who taught me that reading was one of the best experiences in life. The BEST father ever!. His lungs didn\u2019t keep their shit together, as Hazel would say and he left us three months after being diagnosed with cancer (almost 12 years ago).While we were with chemo, and I say we because I used to go with him every Monday, I met a kid who was way too young to have cancer. I couldn\u2019t understand why kids had cancer, it wasn\u2019t fair. Once my father was gone I wanted to get something positive about that horrible experience so I started volunteering with an association that helped kids with cancer: AVOI.The guy who started this association had a kid with cancer who died and he decided to create this association to help families in that situation. He is an example for me. It wasn\u2019t my moment anyway because everything was very fresh and I couldn\u2019t help but think about my father every time I was with those kids and it\u2019s hard when you go back week after week and there are some kids that are not there anymore\u2026This book reminded me of that association. Life sucks sometimes but while you can, get the best of it. Tell your friends and family you love them, don\u2019t assume they know you love them. Enjoy every single second with them because one day, death will take them or will take us.I will give years of my life for one more evening with my dad, to hear his voice one more time so PLEASE show your love and enjoy your family and friends while you can.I don\u2019t want you guys to feel sad about my story because I was lucky, I got to have the BEST father ever and that\u2019s something that makes me happy\u2026"}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4852567-stacy", "userReview": "I had never read a John Green novel prior to reading this one. I wanted very much to like it and felt certain after reading some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here that it would be an awesome and heartbreaking experience. I was ready and excited. I guess I could sum the experience up best by stating that it is unlikely I will read another book by this author, and if I do it will be sometime in the future when I forget how utterly disappointing I found this book to be.\u00a0I had a lot of problems with this book. Overall, it felt very insincere and I was constantly distracted by how obviously everything was written with the goal of tugging on the reader's heart strings, rather than just letting things happen that were beautiful in spite of being sad. It felt like Mr. Green was screaming at me from the page 'ARE YOU SAD YET? YOU'RE SAD RIGHT? THIS IS SAD. YOU SHOULD FEEL ALL THE THINGS AND CRY ABOUT IT. I'M A GOOD WRITER. I WRITE FEELINGS. ARE YOU CRYING YET?' For a story about Human Beings, it doesn't feel very human at all. Instead everything feels very unnatural and self-conscious in the worst way.The biggest and most impossible thing for me to get around was I simply didn't believe the character of Augustus or his relationship with main character Hazel. As these concepts \u00a0are basically what the entire story hinges upon, I didn't believe in or care about anything else that happened either. Augustus came off completely pretentious and obnoxious, particularly in the way he insisted on speaking in a Diablo Cody nerd hipster sort of dialect that no one would ever use in the real world. (Some commenters here have said it's the way Mr. Green himself talks which, a.) way to be self-congratulatory, and b.) how does he not get punched in the face, like, ALL THE TIME?) His entire character felt contrived and I never once felt a connection with him. Too often it seemed like he was walking around like I AM SO CLEVER LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME, constantly putting on a show so that nothing from him felt genuine or real. His whole fascination with ultimately meaningless metaphors felt condescending, like Mr. Green constantly squealing HEY GUYS, SEE WHAT I DID THERE? TAKE A SECOND, WRITE IT DOWN IF YOU NEED TO. YEAH, I'M DEEP. Augustus' one fault was sickness, but it was nothing that he could control. And that's just so... boring.But it wasn't just Augustus. The character of Hazel was somewhat likable, (despite Mr. Green's insistance on making her 'sound like a teenager' by formating every other statement she makes like it's a question? and tacking distracting 'or whatever's onto the end of random bits of dialogue BECAUSE THIS IS HOW TEENAGERS TALK RIGHT? I CAN TALK LIKE A TEENAGER, SEE? BECAUSE THEY SAY 'WHATEVER'. I'M A GOOD WRITER. ARE YOU FEELING THINGS YET?) but her relationship with Augustus felt completely and totally forced. There was never any real reason for them to fall in love with one another, and that is crossing dangerously close into Twilight territory. He was so convienient, so effortless for Hazel. I had to wonder, was it him or was it because he was there and ready and willing? It all fell flat and left so many places to take the stories and facets of their characters completely unexplored. Any opportunities to delve into hard questions and real answers were left untaken and exchanged for large passages (mainly in the **SPOLIER ALERT**: Amsterdam trip scenes) that had very little purpose outside of screaming LOOK AT THIS HANDSOME CHARMING BOY ISN'T HE SWEET LADIES? HE WILL PULL YOUR CHAIR OUT FOR YOU AND HE TALKS LIKE I DO. IT'S CHARMING, RIGHT? YOU ARE FEELING CHARMED. I'M A GOOD WRITER.\u00a0Ultimately, it felt completely fake. I couldn't get lost in it, always fully aware of the fact that I was reading fiction and how irritating EVERYTHING about it was. I finished it, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars, but it was a true task. Truthfully, it pissed me off.

My sister and I actually have a running joke where we just quote this book back and forth to each other. Although honestly anytime anyone says \"It's a metaphor,\" I immediately say \"ya put tha killin' thing between ya teeth but ya don't give it the power to do its killin'!\", affecting the mannerisms of a stereotypical paperboy from the 1920s.It gets a laugh every time. (Or at least a sound of disgust, which is just as satisfying within this context.)There are just so many laughable quotes. \"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: Slowly, then all at once.\" \"Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.\" \"It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.\" \"Because you are beautiful. I enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence.\" (That one is a good one if you, like me, love your friends a lot but are bad at compliments. This will ensure that they know you love them, but also prevent them from ever wanting to talk to you ever again.) Oh, and: \"My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.\" (That last one is probably my favorite, because it gets the most horrified reaction from the audience.) And how could I almost forget the classics: \"Maybe 'okay' could be our 'always.'\" (Also, of course I had to look up those quotes. While I love John Green jokes, my brain is so inherently opposed to him that I cannot memorize his sh*t for the life of me. I still mess up the killing thing between your teeth quote, and I say that one at least weekly.)Anyway. It's comedy gold because this crap is cringe-worth-i-ly affected and pretentious and unrealistic, but also focuses on basic key words and concepts you can latch onto and bring up in pretty much any given conversation.What? Yes, all of my friends do hate me. Why do you ask?I am just about full to bursting and sick to death of John Green's quasi-profound books and boring guys and manic girls and token diverse background characters with one quirk and not much else. I don't know how much more pretentious dialogue and profound ponderings and fake teenage angst I can take.Perhaps unsurprisingly,t his is not so much of a mini review, but I feel like I've had a buildup of John Green-directed anger of late. Don't get me wrong, I'm constantly boiling in it, just due to who I am as a person, but his return to writing and that ugly cover reveal are making me even madder. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, JOHN. IS THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WILL HAVE TO READ YOUR NEW BOOK, SINCE I HAVE LONG JUSTIFIED MY HATRED FOR YOU BY SAYING I'VE READ ALL YOUR SH*T AND DISLIKED IT ALL?Can you tell that I somewhat irrationally believe he knows that I hate him? I've been so outspoken about it. Granted, over half of that outright opposition took place in my junior year AP World History class, but still. The man could have eyes everywhere. Why, you may ask, do I continue to scream about him if I'm so scared he and his cringey YouTube videos and rabid fans will come for my life?Because he is horrible. I enjoy ranting about horrible people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence.(This is part of a project I am doing wherein I write mini reviews of books I read a long time ago.

I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.\u201d------------------Some books will make you laugh so hard your stomach will hurt.Some books will make you so mad that you\u2019d want to throw the book out the window or burn it in fury.Some books will leave you asking for more because it ended with a cliffhanger.Some books will leave you questioning why it ended the way it did.Some books will leave a mark on you not only because it made you cried buckets of tears or made you laugh until you couldn\u2019t breathe but because you felt something as you were reading it and that feeling would never leave you forever.The Fault in Our Stars left that kind of mark in me.It made me cry.It made me laugh occasionally.It made my heart ache.It made me giggly all over when Gus made his moves on Hazel.It made me feel all sort of things and for a book to have that effect on someone it must be really special.The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read.EVER!Hazel has cancer.She already anticipated Death would soon be knocking on her door.She doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends because she keeps to herself.Why? She didn\u2019t want anyone else to be burdened by her death in case it comes.One day at support group he met Augustus (Gus) Waters.They just sort of clicked.Gus liked her but she didn\u2019t want to take their relationship to a higher level because she was afraid that she\u2019d cause him pain if she dies.Hazel think Gus was healthier than she is and that he\u2019ll have more time on earth than she does and that it would be unfair if she lets him in.But no matter how hard she tries to keep her distance from Gus, she just couldn\u2019t.Everything felt right.Fate however has different plans for them.There are so many things I want to say about this book but I\u2019m so afraid I might not get them all right.John Green, you have broken my heart into tiny little pieces.This book made my heart ache and my eyes burn with tears.There was just so much emotion in the pages of this book that it was so hard not to feel them.Hazel was an inspiration.I have never been that sick but I think if I was I wouldn\u2019t be as composed and as strong as she was.Despite her constant need to have an oxygen tank near her she still goes about and does things normally.She doesn\u2019t go out that much with friends though because she wanted to spare them the pain if ever she dies.And while Hazel was sometimes (most of the time) pessimistic, Gus was the exact opposite.He was Hazel\u2019s ray of sunshine.He has this sort of halo of positivity that makes the people feel good including Hazel.While Hazel was my inspiration, Gus was my favorite.I guess this book would not have been that much of a success without Gus.He was smart (though he often doesn\u2019t think so) and funny and sweet and kind and loving.(Damn! Where are all the Gus\u2019s hiding? I\u2019d like to get myself one! LOL.)I finished this book last night after coming home from work.On the last 3 or 4 chapters my eyes were flooded with tears that I can\u2019t stop.My mom actually got worried and asked me if I was okay and told her the reason I was crying was because of this book.The Fault in Our Stars was amazing.I would like to applaud Mr. Green for making such a wonderful and emotionally gripping novel that mirrors the lives of kids who has cancer.Hazel, Gus, Isaac and all of the other kids in the memorial maybe fictional characters but what they were experiencing maybe happening to someone else right now.The characters in this book seemed so real like you and me.Hazel and Gus seemed too mature for their age.Was it the cancer? Possibly but it\u2019s actually something so minor that I don\u2019t care if they think too maturely. I can deal with that.One thing I noticed though was how it reminded me a little (really just a little) of one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks, A Walk to Remember.Gus reminded me of Jaime.Gus changed something in Hazel just like Jaime did to Langdon.Jaime and Gus left their mark.They may have passed but they will never be forgotten.Anyhow, I totally love this book.I highly recommend it.No graphic scenes here so in my opinion it\u2019s totally safe for the teenage kids to read. :)I am so in love with you Mr. Green.Too bad you\u2019re married and with kids.

After all, it was I who spent time reading this book.I guess it has something to do with the fact that so many friends and relatives raved about this book being sad and great prior to my reading. For example, an 8-year old niece of my wife said that she cried while reading the book because it is about teenagers with cancer. Then of course most of my GR friends, foreigners and locals alike, rated this book with either 4 or 5 stars.So, when I started reading this book, I thought I already clammed up. Maybe I was just trying to be different or I would like to show my wife's 8-y/o niece that the book is YA and I am too old (mature) compared to her and have outgrown books like this and definitely would not cry over some silly stories about lovers with cancer.My Dad died of brain cancer in 1997 so definitely I have a big compassion for people suffering from any kind of cancer. However, what is John Green's purpose of using cancer has a major element in this book's romance? Obviously, it is to manipulate people's emotion. It is to gain sympathy because his female readers would like to cry buckets of tears especially if the guy is as good-looking as Augustus the apple of the eyes of our heroine who is also cancer-stricken, Hazel. I mean cancer, like death, is something that we normally don't want to talk about and if we need to talk about it, we usually have a purpose. Sadly, in my opinion, John Green has no particular purpose but for commercial reason: to generate sympathy that means more readers, more sales, more money to bring to the bank.There is nothing new in this book. Hazel's I want to leave a mark prior to dying is everybody's wish really. Augustus' I am not my cancer is too heroic. We all know that it is not true, we all got our big frustrations or lost in lives. We all have been sick at some point in our lives and we go through a period of denial and even if we say we accepted everything, we always keep on hoping that the sickness or the problem would disappear that's why we continuously pray to God. I mean the acceptance is there and we are at peace with ourselves but still call God to interfere and take the sickness away. I just did not feel anything reading this book except the feeling of being manipulated. It's too pretentious and gimmicky. I know John Green is laughing his way to the bank especially because some movie people took advantage of this book's popularity so this even has a big screen adaptation.

She realizes she is going to die, but she is on a drug that is keeping the tumors at bay. At a support group meeting she meets hottie Augustus Waters, who is in remission. They immediately hit it off and change each others lives drastically.The Fault in Our Stars is another beautifully written book by John Green. A few months ago John made a video on his youtube channel, and in this video he read the first two chapter of this book. I was hooked instantly. I wanted to know everything there was to know about Hazel and Augustus. I'm not going to say that this was the most original cancer book out there, but it felt more personal.Let's start with the characters. John Green wrote the same exact character over and over again in his previous books. This is one complaint I've always had, but you won't find that here. Hazel is no Alaska Young, she is no Margot. She's just Hazel, and she's lovely. Same with Augustus. He's unlike all of John Greens male characters, and I adore him.There is simply one complaint I have about this book. John needs to make his 17 year old characters sound more like 17 year old teens than 35 year old men. Most of the dialog in this book and sweet and enjoyable, but then the characters come out with these crazy words and there are other ways to show your characters are intelligent people without always making them spout out these weird, random words. In all honesty it's a bit annoying, but it doesn't bother me too much, because I understand that his younger readers will build a much better vocabulary if they pay attention. Also, his book is full of quotable lines as you can clearly see from everyone else's reviews. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. John is a phenomenal writer. He's great at building suspense when needed, and also at hitting you in the gut with a healthy dose of raw emotion. Almost everyone I know who has read this book cried. At least a little. He also throws in lots of humor which is usually appreciated to break up sad moments.As far as John writing a female voice for the first time, I thought he did a good job. This book wasn't life-changing for me, but I easily could see how others could be affected by this book in an astounding way. It tackles cancer, death, loss of sight, loss of loved ones, love, thoughts of the afterlife and shows vividly from one girls perspective what it may feel like to know you are dying. This book may not suit everyone, but if you don't have issues reading about those things I would recommend this book to you. It was quite depressing at times, but I'm sure you would know that just by reading the synopsis. 4.5/5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1435166-sarah", "userReview": "What can I say about this amazing book that has not already been said a million times?
