He\u2019s one of those people who makes storytelling look easy, even for other storytellers like me, who know very well that it is NOT easy. The amount of research he did for this book must have been staggering. It is a fictionalized telling of the recent drug wars in Mexico and beyond, with all the gore and horror that I remember from the headlines when I was still living in South Texas. It felt so real, so true to what happened, that I started fearing for the author\u2019s safety. It seemed like he was getting dangerously close to telling things exactly as they happened. On the other hand, Winslow finds sympathy and humanity in all his characters, even the most hardened narcos who commit the most heinous atrocities. At heart, this is a story of a friendship gone bad between Art Keller, DEA agent, and Adan Barrera, scion of the most powerful drug cartel family in Sinaloa. Once friends, the two men are now bitterest of enemies, and the book follows them both as they try to outwit one another. Only one man can come out of these drug wars alive. It is not at all clear who will success, or even who is the hero and who is the villain. If you don\u2019t mind grisly violence pulled right out of the news, you will find this a fascinating window into the world of narco trafficking."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "There\u2019s a scene in this book in which a Mexican drug lord essentially strolls out of prison thanks to a corrupt system. Reality imitated art a few weeks after it was released when a Mexican drug lord escaped prison via a tunnel so elaborate that it\u2019s very hard to believe it could have been built unnoticed by prison officials.Don Winslow isn\u2019t a prophet.* He\u2019s just a very talented crime writer who has spent years researching the war on drugs, and he knows all too well how the same mistakes have been repeated since it started. He gave us the fictionalized version of its shady history in Mexico from the 1970s through the end of the century in The Power of the Dog, and he returns with this sequel to tell how much worse it's gotten in the years since.Art Keller is a DEA agent who has been at war with cartel kingpin Adan Barrera for over 3 decades. As Keller and Barrera continue their long blood feud there\u2019s a new power rising in the Mexican drug business. The Zetas were founded by former soldiers who train their members to military standards, and they escalate the turf wars to an astounding level of violence in which murder is routine and decapitations, dismemberment and burning people alive all become standard operating procedure as part of their campaign to terrorize the government, the police, the ordinary citizens, and the rival cartels.As with The Power of the Dog, Winslow isn\u2019t just using the drug war in Mexico as a colorful backdrop to a crime story. The drug war in Mexico is the story, and every corner of it is probed as we get a glimpse behind the curtain of the ultimate futility of it through many characters including a high school football star who becomes a high level narco dealer, a burned out journalist covering the carnage in his beloved hometown, a child whose desperate poverty compels him to become a soldier in the Zeta\u2019s army, a former beauty queen who gets into the drug trade to assert her independence, and a variety of others who put faces on the multiple tragedies and horrors inflicted on Mexico.Winslow spares no one in this clear eyed assessment that looks at the problem from every angle. The US is called to account for its hypocrisy in being both the market for these drugs and the hysterical voice demanding that Mexico stop the flow of narcotics. The corruption of Mexican institutions allows the trade to flourish and the violence to escalate. Big business is in the mix with the flow of trade and oil production in Mexico. US and Mexican police forces have become increasingly militarized because of the drug war. Winslow is making a very ambitious case with this book that the war on drugs has fundamentally changed both countries for the worse and done incalculable damage in the process.It\u2019s that big picture theme and the dedication to using fiction to tell some very harsh truths where the book really shines. Unfortunately, his commitment to that cause does hurt the novel a bit in terms of it\u2019s characters, particularly the female ones who often seem to exist only to act as the conscience or counterweight to the male ones, but all of them are definitely in place to serve a specific plot purpose. Winslow is so good that his natural talent keeps them all interesting and from seeming like cardboard cut-outs,but you can tell where the bulk of his energy was focused.Another aspect that started to wear on me a bit was how repetitive the violence got after a while. This isn\u2019t necessarily Winslow\u2019s failure because he is depicting reality here, and he has his characters becoming numb to the most vicious atrocities as well as commenting several times on how even the unthinkable can become routine if you see a enough of it. So I can understand why he didn\u2019t skimp on that aspect, but it does start to grind you down as a reader after a while.Those are minor nitpicks that I think kept me from liking this one a shade less than The Power of the Dog. Still, Winslow has written a fascinating and horrifying sequel that comes within spitting distance of living up to the first one, and it\u2019s also a book that has some very important things to say about the true cost of the war on drugs as well as being an ambitious crime story told on an epic scale.* Winslow wrote this editorial for CNN about the escape of Joaquin Guzman, and it highlights just how much knowledge he's accumulated about the drug trade in Mexico.Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"...at the end of the day or the end of the world, there are no seperate souls. We will go to heaven or we will go to hell, but we will go together.\"- Don Winslow, The CartelI went into this thinking I was going to get Tom Clancy+, but actually ended up with a novel closer to Norman Mailer. 'The Cartel', and Don Winslow's previous book on the Mexican drug trade ('The Power of the Dog') are best described as a two-part, fictionalized history of the War on Drugs in Mexico.I was first drawn to read this by my little brother who was pimping it hard. He mentioned that he heard 'Ben Afflick' couldn't even get in the bid for the rights to this movie. It optioned for $1M with something like a $5M kicker when the movie got made. I think a similar deal got made for 'The Power of the Dog'. Perhaps, Leonardo Di Capro will star. Perhaps the director from Cormac McCarthy's drug cartel movie (yes, the one where Cameron Diaz makse love to a car) may even direct it. Kinda surreal.Also, it wasn't like I went into this novel not knowing about the drug cartels in Mexico. I live just outside of Phoenix. We used to travel once or twice a year across the border to Rocky Point, but as the Zetas and the violence escalated along the border towns a few years back, our trips decreased. There just seemed to be too much cost for the benefit of sand, 800mg Ibuprofen, and smooth daiquiris. Even still, reading this was like discovering your favorite wound isn't just infected, but hosting a bunch of ugly parasites AND you are largely to blame. Anyway, it is a total history. Winslow delivers the scope and the horror of the Drug War. He shows the impact on the people, the journalists, the poor. He shows the complicity of the US, the corruption of the Mexican police, the Mexican army, the Mexican politicos. It could easily have devolved into a Zeta snuff film, but Winslow turns it into a powerful piece of historical fiction. It is selling like it is just a thriller, but don't let the flash fool you. There is meat here. There is a body in this burning book. Again, the closest I can get to how reading this feels is Mailer's Harlot's Ghost, Littell's The Company, or Ellroy's The Black Dahlia. This isn't Dostoevsky, but it for sure for shit ain't Clancy."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "This is a huge book in every way\u2014for its effects on people\u2019s thinking and actions, in its implications for drug policy worldwide, and in the scope of its historical documentation. It is very up to date. In the fabulous and informative July 13, 2015  interview at Politics & Prose, the Washington, D.C. bookstore, and published online by Slate magazine, Winslow describes the genesis of this book and his writing process.For writers, this downloadable Soundcloud podcast is a must-listen for how one approaches a critically relevant subject with large amounts of historical data. For U.S. residents, this is a must-listen for its implications on recreational drug use. Winslow didn\u2019t want to write this book but he gradually came to realize he \u201cfelt like a deserter from a war\u201d and that he could no longer turn his face away from, and neglect to speak of, the violence against the innocent residents of Mexico.\u201cIf I were south of the border, looking north, I would have questions about corruption.\u201d [Winslow @ Politics & Prose]Winslow\u2019s fictional account of the drug wars in Mexico and the United States is the longest and most important of his work to date, and it is sensational in every way. Winslow has long been recognized for his ability to catch a fascinating slice of the California community, a subset of surfers relaxing into their \u2018fun in the sun\u2019 lifestyle. In this huge, sprawling duo of novels, first The Power of the Dog followed by The Cartel, we have a much more sustained effort of imagination, research, and writerly skill that aligns so closely with headlines, a reader might be forgiven for mistaking Winslow as an intimate of the Mexican drug wars. It is also a song of praise for the journalists who risked everything to cover the story. Winslow used news reports to fictionalize events in a way that gets at the motivations and the darkness and corruption on both sides of the border. This is fiction, but what fiction!\u201cYou do not revenge a murder by killing. You revenge it by living.\u201dThe story itself revolves around the fictional DEA cut-out Art Keller, and the head of the Sonoran [Sinaloan] cartel, Ad\u00e1n Barrera [Joaquin Guzman]. They had been pursuing one another for years and when Barrera escaped jail in the United States to return to his drug kingdom in Mexico, Keller came out of hiding to find him and bring him to justice. Winslow ties in years of documented drug trafficking over the U.S. southern border with a very intimate portrait of both men and their organizations. A reader will be familiar with many of the gruesome violence recounted here\u2014so violent it doesn\u2019t seem believable\u2014and will be grateful to Winslow for making it personal. \u201cAmericans take their strength from victory. Mexican strength derives from their ability to suffer loss.\u201dWinslow does not fail to highlight the role of women in communities throughout Mexico, demonstrating for protection by the police and army. Women often went on record about attacks against their families in a brazen attempt to shame the leaders and the cartels and to show a kind of solidarity with their community. \u201cI have no way of accounting for that kind of courage, for that kind of moral backbone, for that kind of grace,\u201d says Winslow [Slate]. This is a novel about the extremes of human depravity, corruption\u2026and goodness. \u201cThere is such a thing as evil\u2026[and] the world holds horrors\u2026\u201dWinslow\u2019s deep immersion in research for America\u2019s border war on drugs has led him to hold an opinion and to become a public spokesperson for a point of view on how we are managing: \u201cthings are worse than ever before.\u201d The cartels are now advertising their violence, like ISIS, in order to spur recruitment and in order to intimidate. In the last section of this book, the cartels move from narcotrafficking to narcoterrorism, the two phenomena borrowing from one another. In an interview in Esquire with Tom Junod, Winslow talks about his thinking on whether or not the legalization of marijuana in the United States will tamp down the cartel\u2019s power in Mexico:\u201dLook, here's my stance, if that's what you're asking for. I think all drugs should be legal and I wish nobody used any of them. I have no problem with people smoking a little dope. But it always amazes me where people who are so persnickety about buying fair trade coffee, and farm-to-table beef, and about where their chicken was raised, think nothing of buying marijuana, which in all likelihood was raised by murderers, sadists, sociopaths, and in a lot of cases harvested by slave labor. So I don't want to harsh anyone's buzz, but I think that's something that we need to look at because we really are in so many ways responsible for the violence in Mexico through our schizophrenic attitude toward drugs, including marijuana. We spent billions of dollars trying to keep it out and we spend billions of dollars buying it\u2014and it's that conflict that allows the cartels to survive. So as marijuana is legalized, the cartels are getting ready for that in terms of trying to go legit. But on the other hand, you have to understand that the cartel's product is not the drug. The cartel's product is control of the trafficking routes. It doesn't matter what the item is, whether it's marijuana or coke or meth or heroin or blue jeans or bottled water, their product is the plazas, it's the neighborhoods, it's the ability to control those trade routes, okay? So, once marijuana becomes actually legal and starts to grow more in the United States and there's no problem getting it across the border up from Mexico, there will be other products. Because the product doesn't matter.\u201d Winslow points out that the \u201cproduct\u201d now is, in fact, stronger opiates like cheap heroin. Regarding \u2018corruption\u2019 on this side of the border, Winslow cites our incarceration problem and how that relates to racism. Drugs weren\u2019t regulated until black people got in on the action. Then we went after them with a vengeance. Winslow sounds Pynchon-esque in his insistence that we think.This novel doesn\u2019t seem to be getting the critical attention it deserves. It doesn\u2019t look, feel, or sound like a genre novel, except in its pace. If it is not on the lists of important novels published this year, it should be--should have been--in contention for the major prizes. It is a terrific work of imagination that targets important societal issues, is based on historical events, and it challenges us to do better, in our drug habits and in our spending on drug wars. What more can a reader ask from literature?I listened to the Blackstone audio production of this book, read by Ray Porter. It is a primo listening experience, but I had a look at the book, and that\u2019s good also. Get either, or both. You can\u2019t go wrong here.

And so\u2019s Don Winslow\u2019s latest novel, The Cartel, m\u2019kay? Ok, I\u2019ll stop that (m\u2019kay?)! The Cartel spans a decade of the Mexican drug wars from 2004. That\u2019s basically the \u201cstory\u201d because what follows for 640(!) pages is a sprawling mess of characters and horrific incidents none of which adds up to anything. There\u2019s Art Keller, a 50-something former DEA agent who\u2019s retired from locking up drug lords and taken to the monastic life before returning for one last job (what is this, a Steven Seagal movie?!). His totally unconvincing \u201cnemesis\u201d is Adan Barrera, head of the biggest Mexican Cartel, La Federacion, who gets sent to prison where he meets the love of his life, a former beauty queen called Magda. With the head honcho in prison, La Federacion breaks up into factions as a power struggle commences leading to the rise of the ruthless Zetas, a cartel of ex-military thugs. Also thrown into the mix is Pablo, a journalist covering the drug wars, who\u2019s going through a rough divorce and trying to keep custody of his son. There\u2019s a child soldier, Chuy, who earns the nickname Jesus the Kid, after becoming a successful cartel hitman. There\u2019s \u201cCrazy\u201d Eddie Ruiz, a former high school football star turned drug lord. And there\u2019s several dozen other characters too \u2013 hence \u201csprawling mess\u201d! Broadly, the novel follows these various characters as Barrera leaves prison and begins regaining control of his drug empire from the Zetas while avoiding the American DEA. What that actually means is that most of the novel is one nightmarish thing happening after another between the different sides. The cartels battle against each other in escalating, out-of-control violence with huge numbers of assassinations, beheadings, mutilations, people being burned alive in oil barrels, rape, all happening to men, women and children. The violence is gratuitous even if Winslow\u2019s basing this upon reality and the descriptions over hundreds and hundreds of pages, once past the initial shock, results is a numbing in the reader to this madness. It\u2019s one-note and it becomes very boring very quickly for very long. Scattered throughout this rambling narrative are standalone stories that don\u2019t add to the main story but serve to illustrate how the drug wars affect ordinary people. An old country gentleman defends his house single-handedly from the Zetas, taking more than a few with him, and there\u2019s the tragic story of a drugged-out whore who was once the mistress of a corrupt cop. While these tangents add to the already obnoxious page count, some aren\u2019t half bad and are actually more interesting than what\u2019s happening to the recurring characters. Quite why there was so much attention paid to Pablo and his divorce, I don\u2019t know, as none of it was interesting. Nor was it clear how former beauty queen Magda suddenly became a whiz at the drug business once she became Barrera\u2019s woman. Keller and Barrera\u2019s rivalry, supposedly the core conflict of the book, was never once convincing and felt like b-movie schlock at best. That\u2019s what struck me as odd because Winslow can write, really well sometimes - his other novels like Savages and The Winter of Frankie Machine, were great! Why then he decided to write real-life crime drama through the lens of poorly realised corny characters and repetitive \u201cshock\u201d violence that goes nowhere, is a mystery. His writing in The Cartel is among the worst I\u2019ve read from him. Winslow creates one character in a particularly contrived fashion. She\u2019s a young woman who decides to become the law in a small town \u2013 no other cop will do the job so she decides to become the sheriff. She becomes like a surrogate daughter to Keller and his girlfriend and guess what happens to her? The same thing that happens to every non-corrupt cop in Mexico. In comics, this term is called the \u201cwomen in refrigerators\u201d trope, where a female character is hurt/killed purely to provide motivation for the male character. That\u2019s what her role in this story is for Keller. In other words, lazy bullshit writing. Sure, Winslow shows us the horrors of the drug wars and comments banally that it will continue because of the industry behind it. Not just the drug consumers but the increasingly militarised police, the DEA, the prison system, the border authorities, and on and on. The Cartel is a reference to the whole mess, not just the actual cartels who run the drug businesses but the American government, the oil companies who legitimize drug kingpins by working in partnership with them, and various agencies like the DEA. Everyone\u2019s bad, m\u2019kay?As a novel though, it\u2019s a very tedious read with few moments of interest. Full of one-dimensional characters, a non-existent plot, and one nasty scene after another, The Cartel leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth.

The Cartel is an opus of a book and follow-up to his earlier novel, The Power of the Dog. This powerhouse book finds DEA agent Art Keller plunged into the Mexican-American drug cartel wars firing up on both sides of the border, even in Central America. This is a gripping saga, but don't be intimidated by its 624 pages--it reads like a drug rush with Keller pursuing Adan Barrera, the patron of El Federacion, the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel. Wars are ugly and messy, especially this one, as the cartels vie for dominance and Keller is caught in the middle. I really enjoy Don Winslow's present-tense writing style which lends a cinematic immediacy to his storytelling. His use of popular culture references is an added bonus for the \"addicted\" reader. If you enjoy a sprawling, multiple POV story, this one's definitely for you. In some respects, it reminds me of Puzo's The Godfather, but it's even more ruthlessly told. One reviewer called this novel \"The War and Peace of the dope trade.\" It certainly is, and Don Winslow's research is plenty evident in this incredible narco-thriller .

Eckel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31787045-g-h-eckel", "userReview": "Imagine a 17 hour Ken Burns' movie in a novel and you get Don Winslow's, The Cartel. It's an epic story of the drug cartels in Mexico, their turf wars, and their fight with government forces that are as violent and ruthless as the cartels they seek to destroy. The novel focuses on one Don who comes back into power after a stint in jail, and the American agent who originally put him there and wants him incarcerated again. The story is fictional but rings true because it's based on real cartels, e.g., the Zetas and Sinaloa cartels. Winslow must be brilliant. The sheer number of pages, the smooth delivery and the epic story line provide a truly rich and enthralling experience. The catch, however, is that you MUST enjoy reading about the ruthless actions of cartel members, warring cartels, the politics of terror and blackmail, and the corrupt government and police authorities that survive by letting the cartels survive. Much like Puzzo's Godfather, The Cartel puts you squarely in the world of the cartel leaders, their differing leadership styles, the truces and battles they wage, the illegal drugs they sell to a hungry public, and the horrific loss of loved ones on both sides of the battle lines. Keller, the rogue agent, who first put the Don behind bars, is enraged that the Don has escaped and rejoins the CIA to hunt down the Don who killed Keller's family members. It's a story that stretches from Central America, to North America, to Europe.Pros: A brilliant, imaginative journey in the shoes (mostly) of cartel leaders. The depth of detail in the plot, the characters, and the descriptions is mind boggling. We see the human greed for wealth breed ruthless behavior, like mass beheadings, under the auspices of \"business.\" The addiction and need for drugs appears to be as much a part of being human as is our addiction and need for power and wealth. Both addictions lead to momentary highs and certain destruction.Cons: If you're not interested in drug trafficking wars, you will not enjoy this novel. None of the characters are particularly heart warming. Keller, the misfit agent, is our way into the novel but really, we spend more time with the Don than Keller. So, you don't spend too much time rooting for anyone in the novel. Also, the plot is episodic and infinitely long without the usual flow of a central story point that leads to a climax and resolution. We go through two marriages to the Don in this novel, for example. So, beware if you want a tightly focused plot.Final thoughts: The plot moves well throughout the novel but there's no sense of everything being shaped around a story point or a central character flaw that get resolved. Like a Ken Burns film, the novel offers a sweep through history. If you're a person who prefers 2 hour movies to 17 hour movies, you might find yourself skipping through large sections of this novel. The story point, of course, is does Keller get his man, or does the Don get Keller? This is resolved but the sweep of history in between is both remarkable and very long. There aren't passages in the novel that you'll treasure and tweet except for one that comes near the opening of the novel: Mexico doesn't have a drug problem, the United States does. Without buyers, there would be no sellers. The novel isn't moralistic and it doesn't offer a sweet and tidy resolution that cartel members are bad and cia agents are good. After finishing the last page, you'll feel that you've been in Central America for years and you'll have new respect and fear for the cartels operating around the world."}, {"userName": "Snotchocheez", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez", "userReview": "5 starsThere are a number of ways to receive Don Winslow's massive fictional undertaking The Cartel (a novel even more massive when you consider it's a 600+ page, very-much stand-alone sequel focused on the drug trade in Mexico):We could blithely ignore what's gone on in the last few decades, and pretend the Grand Guignol of Mexican horrors hasn't directly affected us and willfully whitewash it from our collective cognizance. We could gobble it up and point to it as a proof-positive exemplar of the rationale behind building a 2,000 mile-long, umpteen feet-high wall separating the US from the evils the bad guys perpetrate (which most assuredly would be missing Winslow's point of this endeavor). Or, we can embrace Winslow's meticulously researched, utterly harrowing saga about how futile the \"War on Drugs\" is, and how it has served primarily to perpetuate the Cartel wars, rather than fix a damn thing.While this is a novel, Winslow has culled the efforts of dozens of journalists (many of whom lost their lives, and aptly eulogized in a Dedication section at the beginning) that have devoted their efforts to make sense of the senselessness. Somehow Winslow is able to weave their reporting of hundreds of truly sickening events into his own narrative, in a way that both accentuates the gravity of their profession (of bringing the world the grisly truth)  and lays the groundwork for this riveting novel. I haven't read the prequel  The Power of the Dog but I don't at all feel like I needed to read it before appreciating  The Cartel, though it might've given me a little more insight toward the motivations behind the main character, Art Keller, if I had. With his nearly three decades of service (first with the CIA, then the Drug Enforcement Agency) he's seen so much awfulness first-hand (thanks to his  pocho, or half-bred ethnicity thrusting him headlong into covert operations infiltrating Mexico's drug cartels) that he's become jaded as to his department's efficacy in the War on Drugs. Only some deep-seated personal animosity toward drug kingpin Ad\u00e1n Barrera (which I think was explained in greater detail in the prequel, but Winslow does a fine job catching readers up) motivates Keller (along with a kick in the ass from the DEA) to abandon his monastic retirement as beekeeper in New Mexico and resume his pursuit of Barrera (only to realize just how hopelessly Byzantine the drug trade has gotten circa 2004, with so many players, so many cartels, so many unstable allegiances, and so many hellish bloodbaths of violence that never seem to end).But  The Cartel is not really Art Keller's story (or, really, Don Winslow's, though he's done an incredible job here). It's the entire package of (fictionally, but still) bringing to light the drug trade in a factual manner that seems to transcend other efforts like the motion picture \"Sicario\" and Netflix's \"Narcos\" series (which I've only seen bits and pieces of, and hadn't really wanted to, thanks in no small part to a former co-worker acquainting me with the gruesome \"El Blog del Narco\" website and not wanting to see a Hollywood-ized treatment of same). I will say, though, that Winslow's literary treatment of a very real (and ongoing) problem should not be ignored. It's necessarily brutal and uncompromising, and pulls no punches. I  highly recommend it for anyone who can stomach the brutality; particularly to those who believe \"Wars on Drugs\" are winnable."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4677640-richard", "userReview": "The Cartel picks up years after the final events in Winslow's drug war chronicle \nThe Power of the Dog\n. And if you thought Dog was epic, wait till you get a load of this one. In a culmination of their 30-year feud, cartel lord Ad\u00e1n Barrera and DEA legend Art Keller have both lost everything and are stuck in their own prisons. Ad\u00e1n is living large behind the bars of a Mexican prison that he turns into his personal headquarters, and Art is living in seclusion at a border monastery. But when Ad\u00e1n strolls out of prison set on making himself El Patr\u00f3n again, Art knows that he's the only one capable of bringing him down. But while both men are set on destroying one another, neither of them is prepared to face the cruel and sadistic ways that the drug war has evolved.\n\nWhen the devil comes, he comes on angel's wings.\n\nThis sequel is basically the Godfather Part II or Empire Strikes Back of Winslow's Cartel trilogy. It's bigger, badder, darker, and more violent. I loved picking up again with these two main characters and found it fascinating to see them struggle with this ferociously brutal evolution of the drug war and the fact that they both had a hand in creating it. But the stand-out in this book is the vast supporting cast of scene-stealing characters, such as my favorite, the rational and pragmatic rising drug lord \"Crazy\" Eddie Ruiz, the tragic child killer Chuy (who's introductory chapter is one of the book's best), or the Ju\u00e1rez reporter Pablo Mora. Each of the rich supporting characters gives us a lens from which to view a particular aspect of this complicated war that affects so many parts of Mexican life and really provides the heart of the story. But the story's backbone is the Keller/Barrera feud, and here, as they each separately try to get a handle on the worsening violence, they still circle one another as their mutual hatred grows, and you get the sense that it can only possibly end with one of them dead. \n\nAt the end of the day or the end of the world, there are no separate souls. We will go to heaven or we will go to hell, but we will go together.\n\n The graphic violence is ratcheted up here, especially with Winslow's inclusion of the rise of the real-life Los Zetas organization, responsible for much of the brutal terror in the past decade in Mexico. It's a bit hard to read at times, and unbelievable, but some quick internet research or at least a passing interest in Mexican news will let you know the harsh truth that Winslow's depictions are not only plausible but actually based on real events. Just google Los Zetas, El Chapo, and recently, Javier Valdez. The timeliness and the authenticity makes the whole thing pretty gripping, and the action culminates in a masterful, climactic, jungle set-piece that kept my eyes glued to the page for the last 50 pages of the book.If you like sweeping crime epics, these books are must-reads! And the best news of all is that Winslow is finishing the work on the last Cartel book, and I'm definitely pumped to read it! \n\nThey say that love conquers all. They're wrong, Keller thinks. Hate conquers all. It even conquers hate."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon", "userReview": "Picking up after the events of The Power of the Dog, Adan Barrera is sitting pretty in a Mexican jail. With corruption at its highest, Adan\u2019s cell looks more like a luxury condo as he orchestrates the actions of his cartel outside the prison walls, waiting for the right time to escape.Art Keller is living a modest life off the grid. After Barrera's escape, Keller is brought back into the fold, charged with tracking down and capturing Adan. And so, it begins again. Keller vs. Barrera. Round Two.When I finished Don Winslow\u2019s epic crime novel The Power of The Dog at the end of August, I was overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by the constant, escalating violence that bloodied the pages. I knew a sequel had been written and as much as I wanted to dive right in, I knew I needed a break. There\u2019s only so much unmitigated carnage this reader could take.After four months, I allowed myself to re-enter Art Keller and Adan Barrera\u2019s blood feud in Winslow\u2019s follow-up, The Cartel. Although Winslow covers a much shorter timeline (ten years as opposed to the roughly thirty in the original), he crams in just as much stomach-churning brutality as the battle escalates between warring cartels south of the border. And by brutality, I mean a pure balls-to-the-wall blood bath. Seriously, this isn\u2019t a book for someone with a weak stomach. In fact, I would often horrify my girlfriend when I would tell her about the awful torture scenes. I\u2019d give out a few details but I think a certain shock factor would be lost.The War on Drugs is a vicious one. There isn\u2019t a line that any of the players involved are not willing to cross. Violence begets more violence as each Cartel struggles for drug dominance. There\u2019s so much death and destruction within that I started to grow numb to the monotony of the atrocities (beheadings, limbs torn from torsos, narcos burned alive). However, somehow, there\u2019s always something much worse that Winslow has waiting in the wings to throw at you. With that said, it\u2019s easy to justify Keller\u2019s fascinating progression from determined DEA agent to something much, much worse. Faced with continuous unconscionable actions from the narco cartels, Keller is given little choice when faced with altering his strategy and putting aside his morals to take down Barrera and his rivals.Despite the ending being wrapped up with a bow, I could easily read several more novels written around the decades-long conflict between Barrera and Keller. The Cartel is a hell of a character study surrounding two men who both live to spite one another."}, {"userName": "Edward Lorn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn", "userReview": "Not as amazing as THE POWER OF THE DOG but still a good read.

Also \"The Cartel\" has the most extreme violence in it (in terms of both type and number of incidents)of any book that I have read (and that is saying something). So much so that I was actually tempted to call it excessive violence - except that from the long list of deceased journalists mentioned in the notes to the book, this book has obviously been meticulously researched (which probably accounts for the long gap between the dates that it and The Power of the Dog were published) so I fear that a lot of the violence may actually be based on fact."}, {"userName": "Nate", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6803829-nate", "userReview": "One of the easiest five stars I've ever given to a book.

Unnoticed by guards, Guzm\u00e1n pried open a 1'6\" sq. metal grill in the floor of his shower, went through the floor, down a ladder, along a tunnel... ...and out the door onto his ride to freedom. So thorough was the rehearsal that government officials discovered the body of a small bird in his trash can; they named the Birdman of Altiplano's deceased bird \"Chapito.\" The escape boosted Guzm\u00e1n's status almost to that of Houdini's, and Don Winslow's into author/prophet. (I can't help that it reminded me of a book I used to read to my kids, The Berenstain Bears and The Spooky Old Tree--couldn't resist) Fellow Winslow fans that had read  Power of the Dog and  The Cartel prior to July 12/15 must have had a moment; mine was the blaring of my BS meter, courtesy of reading Winslow. I had no doubt that fistfuls of money bought Guzm\u00e1n's freedom from a corrupt government. How much would it take to miss the building of the tunnel, for a guard to turn his head, or to not see the tunnel in aerial views?! http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/artic... Beyond turning Winslow's fiction into reality, the event was testimony to the author's 10 years plus of research, and amazing insight into the mind of the boss of the Sinaloa Cartel of whom he says, \"is a brilliant, ruthless billionaire businessman....the most powerful drug lord in history.\" For four years (2009-2012) Guzm\u00e1n was listed on Forbes magazine's billionaires' list until he was dropped by the magazine due to verification issues, whereabouts unknown. Winslow can do the verification; as he says in a CNN commentary,  \"I've been tracking Chapo's career for over 15 years, first writing a fictional version of him in \"The Power of the Dog,\" and most recently about his 2001 escape from prison in \"The Cartel.\" http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/13/opinion...The author's interviews for The Cartel have been hard hitting, fact-based accusations of governments and policies, especially regarding his opinions of this war he says cannot be won.Winslow's fictional parallel runs staggeringly close to the truth with his creation of the Sinaloa drug cartel kingpin, Ad\u00e1n Barrera, mirroring El Chapo's life more like a biography than fiction. His magnum opus spans 40 years of the rise of the Mexican Cartels and the DEA's War on Drugs: Power of the Dog 1975-2005, and The Cartel 2005-2015. The Cartel's narrative picks up from the Power of the Dog with DEA agent Keller continuing his almost obsessive quest to destroy Ad\u00e1n Barrera and revenge his partner's gruesome death. Of course. With the cartel's inventive brutality involved--what other kind is there? \"Kill them a lot.\" Cartel goes deeper into the \"centrifugal dynamics\" of the cartel families, and the fight between the *families* to maintain control of the drugs and therefore the fortunes. The massive amounts of money are mind-blowing; the levels of corruption, knee-buckling. The pages seem soaked with the blood of unimaginable torture, beatings, gang rapes, beheadings -- it's graphically, numbingly violent. Winslow uses the violence not as sensationalism, or as he calls it, \"violence pornography,\" but to drive across the point, and eventually the truth that America doesn't want to acknowledge: This violence and carnage is the consequence of buying drugs; this is your drug $$$ at work, America. Winslow submerges himself and the reader into those towns across the border. It's was easier to hate the cartel and the drug runners that travel through our communities with the veil of ignorance. Easier to point the finger and ignore, as the saying goes, the 3 pointing back. Winslow cuts deeply through our misconceptions. He poignantly tells the people's story, their genealogy; he explains the social and economic structures that crumbled under the violent insistence of the cartels; he chronicles the fights of the brave willing to stand up to the cartel knowing they would be killed. John Powers of Fresh Air, gave a review that captured the essence of the book and recognized Winslow's multiple talents as both a reporter and a writer. \n\"Steeped in reportage, the novel. . . possesses a virtue I associate with traditional documentaries: it explains things. I finished the book understanding why Ju\u00e1rez is so violent; why cartels murder so many innocent people; why both the American and Mexican governments favor some cartels over others; and why the war on drugs is not just futile, but morally compromised. It\u2019s here that fiction and documentary come together in a shared sense of, well, bleakness.\u201d\n\nAt one point Ad\u00e1n Barrera looks over the landscape and wistfully recalls a different Mexico, one of pastoral beauty, and music, poets, and artists. Then he packs his wife off across the border to give birth to his child while he loads his guns to do business. According to a PBS article, \"between 2007 and 2014 \u2014 a period that accounts for some of the bloodiest years of the nation\u2019s war against the drug cartels \u2014 more than 164,000 people were victims of homicide.\" 90% of the cause of those deaths comes to America. There is some ugly math in those stats.Growing up we looked forward to our trips across the border to Tijuana, not so much Mom's pre-trip speech about the dangers of Mexico, i.e. getting lost, seeing lewd acts that involved a woman and a donkey, eating contaminated food, getting tricked out of paying too much for junk. We'd buy huaraches with tire tread soles, leather fringed jackets, get our pictures taken on donkey/zebras, and buy novelty \"horse-shit cigarettes\" for our friends. Then, while she was bickering over the price of giant crepe paper flowers with a Mexican woman, or shooing away a kid trying to wash the windshield, Dad would sneak us off and buy us some mystery meat delicacy cooking over a burning garbage can. Afterwards we'd chug a warm Orange Crush and tease each other that it was cat meat and we were going to get the ol' Montezuma's Revenge...sometimes we would.

I had so many questions, and Winslow answered them. Hell, CNN could never make sense of what the hell was going on down there. So yeah, here it is Power of the Dog part two, a work of fiction (yeah right)--orale compa\u00f1ero, mierda no es nada\u2026"}, {"userName": "Cphe", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14907696-cphe", "userReview": "This story follows on from The Power of the Dog. It's not too often that you come across a second novel in a continuing storyline that is as excellent as the first novel. A story of revenge, power and domination between Art Keller and drug lord Aden Barrera in South America. It's a violent, dark and seedy world that they inhabit. Sometimes difficult to ascertain just who the \"good guys\" are meant to be. A fitting ending to the struggle between the two characters. Time and money well spent and deserving of the 5 star rating."}, {"userName": "Ms.pegasus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus", "userReview": "The dedication belies the standard disclaimer:  \u201cThis is a work of fiction....\u201d  That dedication is a list of over 120 journalists murdered or \u201cdisappeared\u201d in Mexico during the time frame of this novel (2004-2012). It ends with the chilling valediction:  \u201cThere were others.\u201d THE CARTEL opens in November 2012 with a familiar action sequence. A Blackhawk carrying special forces flies on a clandestine assassination mission on foreign soil. What follows is a flashback of the previous eight years of increasingly horrific violence unfolding over the the novel's 600 pages. The story is told in third person present tense enhancing the feel of immediacy. Winslow takes a static abstraction, the war on drugs, and transforms it into a visceral reality, a literal war among shifting alliances of drug lords and corrupted police and military agencies. The groups metastasize: the Cartel del Golfo, the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas, La Familia Michoacana, La Linea, Los Negros, Los Aztecas \u2014 readers can be forgiven for being overwhelmed. On the street a new lexicon of atrocities develops.Like any war, there is a geopolitical canvas. Sinaloa is the home turf of the powerful drug cartel run by Ad\u00e1n Barrera, but Sinaloa lacks a border with its primary market, the United States. The key corridors are Ju\u00e1rez/El Paso; Matamoros/Houston-New Orleans; Nuevo Laredo/Laredo-Dallas; and Tijuana/San Diego. The conflict is inevitable. It's a matter of logistics. Expansion depends on control of these portals.Winslow peoples this novel with memorable characters made real by their shifting agendas and the brutal logic of impossible choices. Art Keller returns to his position at the DEA in order to kill Barrera who was responsible for his partner's death. His primary problem, however, becomes not getting evicted by either his Mexican colleagues or his U.S. Bosses. Eddie Ruiz is a 26 year old drug dealer who joins Barrera's faction to avenge the torture-murder of his friend and fellow dealer Chacho Garcia. His focus later shifts to the more fundamental problem of staying alive himself. Heriberto Ochoa militarizes the cartel with a disciplined force of bodyguards turned private army. My favorite character is introduced relatively late in the book. Pablo Mora is a Ju\u00e1rez journalist with penetrating acumen. His pronouncements are some of the most powerful statements in the book. He points to the blight of North American capitalism as the catalyst of Mexico's ills. The maquiladoras swept into towns like Nuevo Laredo and Ju\u00e1ez, set up their corporate offices in Monterrey, then abandoned Mexico for even cheaper labor in China.  \u201cThe first wave created gigantic slums as workers poured in from all over Mexico, but especially the poor rural south. The city couldn't hope to keep up with the population boom, and the colonias had little, if any, infrastructure....And because the maquiladoras' management preferred women workers, it left thousands of men, shamed and bitter, to sit idly in the slums, drinking cheap beer and, increasingly doing drugs. The colonias were bad \u2014 when the maquiladores left for even higher profit margins, they got worse.\u201d  (p.284) Later he bitterly reflects:  \u201cMexico, the land of pyramids and palaces, deserts and jungles, mountains and beaches, markets and gardens, boulevards and cobblestoned streets, broad plazas and hidden courtyards, is now known as a slaughter ground. And for what? So North Americans can get high.\u201d  (p.314) No reader can distance himself from the problem after reading this passionate outpouring.This is a disturbing book to read. It tracks the dissolution of war into anarchy. It draws obvious parallels with the terrorism in Syria. It focuses on the contrast between the failure of a counterinsurgency (defensive) strategy with the cost of an antiterrorism (offensive) strategy. Winslow has performed a kind of alchemy, distilling his vast research into a compelling thriller that reverberates with reality.NOTES:Chapter 8 of Maria Armoudian's KILL THE MESSENGER documents the decades long suppression of a free press in Mexico and closes in the time period covered by Winslow.The author is interviewed by NPR: http://www.npr.org/2015/07/15/4232030..."}, {"userName": "Nigeyb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb", "userReview": "I read 'The Cartel' immediately after it's prequel 'The Power of the Dog'. According to the New York Times 'The Cartel' can be read as a stand alone book but it's best to read the two books in sequence. I agree.Together, 'The Power of the Dog' and 'The Cartel' span nearly 1,200 pages and 40 years and present a multifaceted view of the War on Drugs. 'The Power of the Dog' covers the first 30 years, during which the war was fought on a much more intimate scale than it was from 2004 to 2014, the period covered by 'The Cartel'.I loved 'The Power of the Dog', and 'The Cartel' is a worthy follow up and conclusion. It's just one long story. One that tells you everything you could possibly want to know about the War on Drugs, and a fair amount you probably wish you hadn't been told, not least the thousands upon thousands of deaths, many detailed here in gory, horrific detail. You will also discover the huge, interwoven network of national interests, risk averse government agencies, ill conceived policies, corrupt officials, big business, and plenty more, all driven by greed and hedonism. It's a shabby, sordid and, sadly, all too true tale.5/5"}, {"userName": "Lauren ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren", "userReview": "This book is filed under Fiction because it is a fictionalized account, but the events, the descriptions, the locations and even many of the names are very real. The disturbing violence is very real. The situations have precedence, and while I knew this overall, reading Winslow's recent article in Esquire, underscored it even more (See: \nEl Chapo and the Secret History of the Heroin Crisis\n). It's devastating, but it's important. Following the narrow, law enforcement both US and Mexican, and the journalists, we get a 360* view on the ground. Intriguing characters - including some strong females that command full attention when they are \"on stage\" (Magda, Marisol \"La Medica Hermosa\", Jimena, Ana, Victoria, etc.) Jimena's story truly intrigued me: a mother who goes on hunger strike until the cartel-owned policia return her kidnapped son. The book is epic - spanning years - a small sliver of this decades long \"war on drugs\" that continues to fail more and more every day (See article linked above...) I didn't realize when I picked it up that it is the second in a series (I don't think I truly missed anything picking it up at this point).Recommended. --*Book Riot Read Harder Challenge - Book over 500 pages - Page count: 616"}, {"userName": "Malia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia", "userReview": "Wow, what a shocking story.

Like many Americans, I used to talk about Mexico's corruption, how easy it was for drug criminals to move their goods through Mexico. I understood the problem was an American one, too. No demand, no drugs flowing into the US, no violence, no corruption. What I didn't understand until I read this book is how hopeless it is for the Mexican police, local state and federal. There's a fictional federal law enforcement official mentioned who tries to explain to the American protagonist, a former soldier and CIA official almost as ruthless as the drug lords. You seem to think we have a choice, he says. But when the drug lord shows you a picture of your children walking out of school, and says, you will call us when the next raid is established, you take the money and follow orders. From the smallest town, where the drug people own the police force, or the Mexican Army whose leaders are also extorted about their children, everyone is affected. Everyone is suspect. Everyone is threatened. This novel, THE CARTEL, will scare the hell out of you. Gruesome in its implications for all of us. Winslow throws many jabs at America and American institutions, some deserved, some not, but the 750-page story is about Mexico and the sad people who live there. There are no happy endings.
