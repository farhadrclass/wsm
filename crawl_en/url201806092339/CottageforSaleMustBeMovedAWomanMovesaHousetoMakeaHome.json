A woman who lives in a Cape Cod house on, where else? Cape Cod sees an advertisement for a colony of vacation cottage homes for sale. For a mere three thousand dollars she could own one of them. She visits the colony, falls in love with one particular cottage, and buys it.The next several hundred pages contain her adventure in the world of conquering burocrats, getting permission to travel with a cottage, getting it to her property, but promising not to disturb the wetlands, which her property borders, arguing that she will not have more than three bedrooms because the cottage is going to serve as her office and what difference does it make anyway?She also has trying adventures with the various contracters to move, build, paint, pour cement and what not.In the end it all comes together, a rougher ride than she expected but who can predict these things?Whouley's writing style is engaging and she makes what must have been a tedious process sound interesting.My only complaints are that she could have developed the characters more. I realize this was non-fiction and one can only know so much about men who work on your house, but she never really lets us know her friends and family, either. One particular person, Barbara, whose family owned the property, had a lot of potential and I would very much have liked to have gotten to know her better but we only get a glimpse of her in the beginning and at the end when she is bedridden. It seems an entire story took place while we were attaching the cottage, but we never get to learn of it.The other complaint I have is that the author writes everything in present tense. I cannot emphasize enough how much I hate reading a story in present tense. If you are not writing in second person you have no business writing in the present tense. It drains any color or rhythm her writing might otherwise have had. All the sentences limp along: subject verb. subject verb. subject verb. It's like listening to someone with one of those ugly monotone voices. A voice with no lilt, no lift, no melodic line. As a musician, I cannot tolerate voices of people who refuse to listen to themselves. As a reader, I feel the same way about tone deaf sentences.On a positive note, I found her yearning for male relationships entertaining, but only because, being single after an ugly divorce, I was that person. With so many males crawling all over your house, surely one of them is The One. I won't tell you in case you like to be surprised.I could comment on the unrealistic expectations of a forty-something woman who has never married and perhaps that is why she has never married, but you may want to draw your own conclusions.Is the book worth reading? It's not War and Peace, but it was a fun, if small, rollick."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2130215-kate", "userReview": "\"When Kate Whouley saw the classified ad for an abandoned vacation cottage, she began to dream.

It was a fascinating combination of the actual nuts and bolts of moving a house and Kate's growth into a competent, more confident woman as she dealt with \"the surprises, complications, and self-discoveries of her house-moving adventure.\" It was fascinating!"}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/290848-john", "userReview": "I wasn't sure whether I'd be able to get into this one with all of the construction-related detail, but in the end that didn't really matter. There's enough observation of Cape Cod life, along with glimpses into the author's own background, to see what an interesting person she can be. Now that I know Whouley's writing is so solid, I'm really looking forward to reading (listening to actually) her recent book on being a caregiver for her mother's Alzheimer's: Remembering the Music, Forgetting the Words: Travels with Mom in the Land of Dementia."}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26956015-joanne", "userReview": "Overall a little underwhelming. I was drawn to this book because I like memoir and I enjoy reading about places I have lived. This one at its core is a story of home renovation. Really, it's not that exciting. My edition included an interview with the author at the end of the book in which she states her motivation for writing the book was to extend/capture the joy of the renovation. I can totally understand her enthusiasm for expanding her home, but really who wants to hear a lot about someone else's building project? Laying down floor boards for a new hallway isn't the most exciting topic. Once the cottage was moved and there was still half a book left, I wondered in exasperation, \"Is she really just going to detail her renovation?\" Unfortunately, she does. There are occasional bits of her personal life that kept me engaged and thinking perhaps there is more to this, but really there is not. Although the personal details kept me trying to connect to the writer, they really don't go anywhere."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14527721-barb", "userReview": "There is something about the genre of books about people building their own homes or cottages or cabins that I simply adore. This one was solid -- the author is an engaging writer and I got a nice sense of the people involved in her project and the work being done. Even her cat's personality came through (and I hate cats). The other aspect that I appreciated was her go-for-it attitude throughout the process. As a more cautious, belts & suspenders person myself, I'm energized by someone else's risk taking, especially when it doesn't seem out-of-reach. Overall, a very enjoyable and inspiring read for the new year."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3352272-ellen", "userReview": "It took a while for this book to take hold for me, due in large part to the subject matter. The project of moving a cottage and attaching it to a house, navigating contractors and paint colors, didn't feel significant enough.

It was a serendipitous find, browsing the Ashland Public Library's shelves on residential architecture. Wholey's marriage metaphor aptly describes the complicated, deliberate, craftsman union of Whouley's small Cape Code home to an old-new cottage moved to the site - combining what I see as the best of measured, considered thought, and a beautiful, extravagant, certain passion.Whouley's cat looks on as Whouley chronicles her thorough and painstaking negotiation of details involved in land use permits, the talents of craftsmen and the progression of the project. I love her careful extravagance to create a perfect space, a space of dreams and vision. I think she must be a remarkable woman, caring so much about the work at hand, and communicating so well its personal importance to those in her life. Every detail is so carefully thought out, and I find it marvelous that the builders Whouley works with are so able, and so capable of both trusting her vision, and sharing their own perspective. It's a flexibility of construction that I didn't think existed in real life.The other aspects of this work that I loved were the use of space and perception of light. The need to expand into new space was constrained for so long, that when it finally occured, Whouley's discomfort was almost comical. A conversation later, and resulting furniture rearrangement resolved the difficulty. Her bedroom too, a bed centrally placed to see the sky and the trees gave peace and freedom. How the two buildings were made into one showed how clearly Whouley understood the relationship of the structures to each other and to herself. Light was central to the work too, from neighbor Barbara Dowe's dark bedroom to Whouley's understanding that skylights, windows and doors, the flow from old to new, from inside to outside, to being in a place of light and with a view - I can wholeheartedly consent to placing these as a priority of place and in life. This place, this home is wholley and entirely Kate's.I hope never to have to build, or to renovate but if I do, Whouley's work leaves me optimistic that it is possible with the right skills, the right outlook, and the right people on your side.Thank you Kate Whouley for writing Cottage for Sale, Must be Moved. There's so much more to think of in your work, thoughts that I consider private and personal, and so I am grateful for your expression of them. I wish to see more of your independent bookstore design work, more photos of your home. I so look forward to reading Remembering the Music and learning from your perspective and your narrative.\n--Ashland Mystery"}, {"userName": "Charlene", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7333141-charlene", "userReview": "I finished it and overall likes it, but feel like the same story could've been written in half the pages.

Not everyone is willing to wade through the paperwork and other obstacles in order to add on to your house by buying and moving an abandoned vacation cottage, but that's what single woman Kate Whouley did. Being the handy woman in my house, it was interesting to read about how she handled all the workMEN she depended on to get the job done, along with those local agencies, like the conservation commission, whose permission must be obtained. Being a former cat owner, I enjoyed her descriptions of Egypt's comings and goings. I appreciate visuals so I liked the photos she included.
