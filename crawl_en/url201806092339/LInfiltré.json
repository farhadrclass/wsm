He took more than half the book to create this wonderfully detailed plot and then three chapters to close the book. Three chapters in which he untwisted some of the elements of the plot, didn't resolve anything, and quit to early. I felt so unfulfilled at the end.It kills me that his latest books haven't been up to par with his earlier works. In the beginning, his books were well-crafted and well-executed. After he began seeing his books turn into movies, they became a little fluffier but he eventually returned with The Street Lawyer and The Broker. But alas, we are back to the fluff and I'm sad to say that he is falling in my list of fav authors.."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael", "userReview": "Good books don't necessarily have to provide all the answers to every plot thread introduced into them. We want our characters to feel like they have lives beyond the confines of the printed page and that their story exists before, during and after the book we're reading. But a good book should at least provide the reader with some sense of closure and not the feeling like an editor was standing over the writer, pointing out that he or she had x-number of pages left or he or she was slowly reaching the word count for the novel and that wrapping up the book soon would be a good idea. There should be some sense of closure, not just a sense of wrapping things up.There's a distinct lack of closure to John Grisham's new novel. \"The Associate\" spents 275 pages setting up the situation Kyle McAvoy faces. Years ago, his roommates at a frat party took advantage of a young woman, while she may or may not have been passed out. The young girl had a reputation and when she tried to press charges for rape, the investigation hit a quick dead end and the matter was dropped. Or so it would appear. While Kyle wasn't one of the participants, he was in the room when it happened. Now, years later video from a camera phone has surfaced in the hands of men who want Kyle to do thier bidding. He is to accept a job with a high-prestige law firm and spy on them for these men. This mysterious group seems to have their fingers in a lot of pies an a lot of power, though it's never explained why or if they're manipulating certain aspects of Kyle's life and that of his friends. They hold the tape over Kyle's head throughout the story, saying that while it may not lead to charges it will certainly ruin the life of Kyle and his friends. Kyle is pressed into service in an impossible situation and slowly begins to try and find a way out of it. By reading spy novels, he routinely sheds those tailing him and begins to slowly fight back, forming a plan of his own. Meanwhile, he's got the soulless first year job at a law firm and maybe a connection with a fellow female associate. It's a lot to take in and Grisham does a nice job of keeping the plot moving for the first 300 or so pages. But it's right around a huge turning point in the novel that things slowly being to unravel. I won't say the turning point, but if you've read the book, you can probably peg it. It involves one of the group of the accused who went to Hollywood seeking his fame and fortune. Suddenly, things kick into a different gear and Kyle makes some decisions. These are things that could and should change the story and ratchet things into a higher gear, adding to the suspense and making the pages turn faster. And they do...except these things all happen 30 or so pages before the novel ends.And the novel just wraps up. In one of the more unsatisfying endings I've read in a while, Grisham just finishes the story. In the end, justice isn't really served and you can see how Grisham is trying to create a morally ambigious ending, but yet it just doesn't feel satisfying. Kyle isn't a purely innocent character, but it'd be nice if it felt like some or any of the bad guys got what was coming to them in the end. Instead, it's one of those--hey, life sucks but what are you going to do? endings that left me frustrated and wondering where the rest of the book was.We could at least know that Kyle got the girl or something. A hint, anything besides what we go.And that's a shame. Because Grisham works hard in creating Kyle and allowing us to identify with him and feel sympathy for him as the net closes in around him. This could have been great Grisham. Instead it's just mediocre Grisham."}, {"userName": "Terrie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1516383-terrie", "userReview": "The most anti-climactic book ever.

The magnitude of the conspiracy caused Kyle's heart to hammer away. His mouth became dry and he sipped lukewarm coffee. He wanted to leap for the door, sprint down forty-one flights of stairs, and run through the streets of New York like a madman.\"\nKyle McAvoy plans to finish law school, then work for the under-privileged for a few years before heading for the big time and money. However, Kyle has a dirty secret locked away in his past. Only a handful of people know about it and they are all just as culpable. What happens when the secret that could ruin Kyle's life falls into the wrong hands? What if these are deadly hands that will stop at nothing to get what they want? How will Kyle respond when confronted with the evidence and when he is commanded to do the unthinkable?The plot for this book was pretty standard. There was the odd twist, but nothing seriously shocking. The ending fell flat....although I had to keep reading to find out what happened. It was difficult to put down purely because of the suspense and \"need to know\" element. I suppose I should give Grisham credit for that as it's part of what makes a good novel. However, if you build a reader up in this way, you must make sure you deliver with a dramatic and satisfying conclusion. Sometimes, Grisham seems to leave his characters floundering and there should be a sequel. I felt that this was the case with The Associate. It wasn't one of his best books, nor one of his worst, slightly better than just okay.The main takeaway points were that it's better to do the right thing at the earliest possible stage because otherwise you just end up digging a huge hole for yourself, and other people. Also, that the end does not necessarily justify the means, if they are unethical or inadvisable. Doing the right thing will also not always win you friends or make people happy here on earth, but God sees the choices we make and He is honoured when we listen to our conscience. He promises to honour us if we honour Him.I also felt exhausted by the workaholic lawyers in this book; billing countless hours, cheating their clients, sleeping at their desks, absent from their families, and mostly detesting their work which had totally taken over their lives. One has to wonder what the purpose is, if there is no quality of life outside work, then what is the striving for? Greed can consume a person and make them miserable as whatever they have will never be enough. This is exemplified in this book and can be a warning to anyone inclined to workaholism that it will never satisfy. Work is important and the mandate was originally given by God, but there's a difference between working to live and living to work!There is the odd bit of swearing in this book and a limited amount of non-graphic sexual content. There is also some non-graphic violence.Grisham fans will enjoy this.Check out my John Grisham Shelf!"}, {"userName": "Salymar", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9986049-salymar", "userReview": "I'll start this review by saying I LOVE KYLE MC AVOY. He's an idealistic, brave, intelligent not to mention a good looking law student. I wish I can find someone like him at the law school I'm going to be accepted at. (HAHA. Sorry, the girly side of my brain started to speak up. lol)Some people say that this is a suffice to John Grisham's highly acclaimed novel, 'The Firm'. And after reading this, I found out that it is real and adequate. For the reason that in both novels, young lawyers are on the run chased by fraud FBI agents or blackmailers from pathetic law firms. At the end, when our heart is very thrilled about a young lawyer being chased and all. Both characters (Mitch The Firm and Kyle The Associate) change their mind and set about trapping the blackmailers. And that's it. The ending is unbelievably unwrapped up.However, despite the fact that I was thornly disappointed about the idea of how \"The Associate\" has been written. I have this feeling of LOVING IT. The novel has a very fast pacing because I was thoroughly caught up in this book from page one (1) until the very last page. Very exciting!The idea of working at a big law firm started to bug me (in a good way). I feel like, I wanted to work as a litigator and as an associate at a law firm after I have passed the bar exam (Always look forward and think positively! :p) but my dad often tells me that in the Philippines, law firms are not given the chance to rise up. The legal system is quite different here in the Philippines (I didn't mean to sound vague about it -because I mean it in a positive way...I guess). Well, alternatively, maybe an organization will suit me up. Hehe.At the end, I gave this book an awesome verdict, 4 stars! :)Oh! I forgot to mention: I found Kyle's dad very similar with the street lawyer (also by J. Grisham).

However, not everything takes course as planned - Kyle is confronted with an unsettling detail of his past, a girl who claims to have been raped by two of his friends while Kyle himself watched dead drunk. A mysterious undercover agent blackmails him with this information and forces Kyle to spy on his new employers and to pass important data if he does not want his future to be destroyed by one fateful night.Initially, I went to our local library, knowing they have tons of Grisham novels on their shelves, with the intention to borrow either \"The Firm\" or \"The Client\". I have watched the movie adaptions of both novels and enjoyed them immensely, so I wanted to figure out whether or not Grisham's novels are able to surprise me even more. Anyway, it turned out the library features all Grisham novels except for \"The Firm\" and \"The Client\". Dissatisfied, I randomly picked one of his other works without previously checking via Goodreads how popular the book is and which basic sentiment the average opinions represent, as I would usually have done. Soon afterwards I realized that not only is \"The Associate\" one of his younger works, but also one of his more criticized ones, and not without good reason.Grisham introduceds an interesting protagonist I was able to sympathize with. Over the course of 300 pages, he establishes an intriguing atmosphere and makes his reader want to know how Kyle will eventually get out of his intricate situation. And then, just as everyone else seems to have criticized, he spends twenty pages on a disappointing climax and lets the story swash along for the rest of the book. All in all, it remains an average story, not necessarily good, but neither frustrating or badly disappointing. I kind of lost interest in the book after 250 pages or so, yet it remained entertaining and provided some interesting thoughts on life as an attorney in the Wall Street. I have never been to New York, don't know much about lawyers and am not too interested in law as a subject of study, so I cannot judge how realistically Grisham has portrayed an attorney's life, but he managed to pull me into a world of power struggles and intrigues in spite of an anticlimatic ending, so it finally deserves a decent three-star rating."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "It seems like lately when I read Grisham, its a good story with some interesting twists and turns, but the climax is not really super exciting and there tends not to be all that much resolution.

By that, I mean that he is capable of putting nouns, verbs, and punctuation in order to form sentences, because that is what The Associate is: basically just a lot of sentences. Sentences describing parties, lunches, bed linens, apartment interiors, and hunting trips, with half-assed attempts at intrigue and characterization thrown in here and there. Of course that's what \"comfort fiction\" and \"beach reads\" are all about. But I had it in my head from reading The Client and The Chamber when I was younger that Grisham could write a sort of thrilling legal mystery too.One thing that Grisham CANNOT do, if this book is really representative of \"vintage Grisham,\" is build a character on anything except cliches. This would be another excellent reason to avoid Ford County (its garish paperback cover is number one), although I have to admit that I was curious about the idea of a non-genre Grisham book that's mercifully not about Christmas, football, or pizzas. So, here we've got the Hispanic ex-gang member (of course) who's made it his life's work to help alcoholic frat boys reform and who also sort of resembles Che Guevara when he wears a beret (that Grisham actually wrote this sentence is still cracking me up). We've got the tough, man-hating female lawyer named \"Mike,\" who we're told has multiple divorces under her belt and represents the book's lesbian client while outfitted in black leather and stilettos, the product of either a BDSM-LGBTQ combo fantasy run amuck or casual sexism or maybe both. We've got the hot blonde female lawyer who, despite being cold and reclusive, is sleeping with Kyle in less than 100 pages and whose back (her BACK) is described as \"trim with a nice curve to it\" or something crazy like that. The thing about all of these stereotypes is that they're all just a little bit wacky, and this makes me think that Grisham is sincerely trying and sincerely out of touch. When I got to the part where Kyle tells hot blonde lawyer that he'll watch \"anything but a chick flick\" with her, I found that I wasn't even irritated at this (definite) casual sexism. I just flicked my wrist and thought, \"John Grisham, you cad!\"SPOILERS from here on out:With regard to the legal intrigue that's only intriguing for the first 50 pages and probably about 75 towards the end, I have nothing else to say except that the ending is HILARIOUS. For those of you who haven't read the book, I'm going to summarize what happens now: top Yale law student Kyle is blackmailed into spying on a top law firm from within, by villians of high intelligence and indeterminate motive. This motive remains undetermined through the ending -- so, thanks a lot for that, Grisham -- but along the way they follow Kyle's every move, wiretap his apartment, assassinate one of his college friends in a gas station bathroom, and manage to foil the FBI coming to take them down. Kyle is terrified of them with good reason. Yet, at the very end of the book, when the bad guys have gotten away, Kyle \"heroically\"....turns down the security of the witness protection program??? Because he assumes the bad guys have fled??? And decides that he's just going to go back home and get on with his normal life after thoroughly pissing off the guys who assassinated his friend and who just eluded capture??? The last sentence of this book is \"They shook hands and said goodbye, and Roy watched [Kyle] stride nonchalantly along Broad Street and disappear around a corner.\" I know that Grisham intended for this to be such a badass moment, but I felt like the unfinished continuance of that sentence should be \"where he was then shot.\" No one is that stupid. Kyle is a Yale graduate. A lawyer! Was terrified of these people a few chapters ago! It's like Grisham wrote up to page 415, had an aneurysm, and went back to finish it off without rereading.This book is not not terrible. But I can't give it the one star that it probably deserves. I laughed a lot. I craved pizza at the appropriate moments. It served its purpose. Bravo, John Grisham."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/747648-jeffrey", "userReview": "This novel is not precisely a reworking of Grisham's famous first huge bestseller \"The Firm\", but some might jump to that conclusion because the setting is similar. If you recall, in The Firm, the partners were mobsters. In this novel, the firm in question is merely an oppressive giant New York law firm, probably no different in its treatment of first year associates than many of the giant white shoe firms in New York now. As an aside, Grisham is sure to throw in his usual barbs about the law practice, in this case having one of the more decent partners reveal to the young Kyle that he \"estimates his billing\", overcharges clients for meals and treats his young colleagues as chauffers, but these are only petty comments about the book.The real story in this novel is that an unscrupulous spy involved in industrial espionage has found a way to make Kyle, follow his orders. Kyle, the main character, is in his final year of law school at Yale. He is the son of a local lawyer (who as is typical is lauded by Grisham), and is the prestigious editor of the Yale Law Review. As a second year law student he worked for the giant New York law firm, which has offered him a job, but Kyle has no interest in this position as he intends to join a smaller firm where he can help people. However, he is approached by some men who appear to be agents of the FBI who want him to meet a Pittsburgh police officer Bennie, who they claim has a video showing that Kyle witnessed and/or participated in a rape on campus when he was a senior at his fraternity during his last year at college. Kyle sees the video which appears to be condemning.  Bennie, the fake cop, tells Kyle that if he does what Bennie wants, Kyle will not be indicted and the video will not be released. What Bennie wants is for Kyle to provide him with sensitive material that is being held as an exhibit in a pending law suit about a supersonic jet. He orders Kyle to back out of his planned next law job and take a job with the large New York law firm. Of course, Kyle, the underdog ingeniously plans out a way to escape this nefarious scheme. The ending is a little too pat for me, but the fun in this book is following Kyle's adventures in spydom, his life and the life of his fellow first year students and the hell that is a first year associates lot in a huge law firm.Except for the ending, this novel is not bad and frankly is a lot better than his baseball novel set in Italy."}, {"userName": "Fred", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22594333-fred", "userReview": "NYT #1 list - Sept 15, 2009 http://www.hawes.com/2009/2009-02-15.pdf** Reread 2013 - I had no review from 2009*Kyle McAvoy, graduates Yale Law with honors, the Yale Law Review editor, ready for his dream to be a public interest moral & ethic lawyer.

And this one was a really good reminder.I was a big fan back in the nineties, when he first came out. I read all the books, watched most of the movies. But the stuff he writes now is so. . . different. In the last couple of books of his I've read, it seems like when the time comes for the crap to hit the fan, he just flushes the crap instead. Sure, it's nice and clean, but not nearly as exciting. Nowadays, he seems far more interested in preaching his ideals on the legal profession than in writing actual thrillers.The Associate is Kyle McAvoy. A different name, but basically the same character that stars in every Grisham novel. A wet-behind-the-ears kid, fresh out of law school, who has to take on the world and figure out how to outsmart everyone. He's Mitch McDeere, he's Darby Shaw, he's Rudy Baylor. Kyle is just finishing up law school at Yale and is planning to work for a public-interest firm after graduation when a bad guy surfaces with a video, secretly taken by a cell phone, which reveals the bawdy details of a drunken frat party five years earlier. The video contains evidence that a couple of Kyle's buddies had relations with a girl who may have been unconcious at the time. Although the video contains no evidence than Kyle did anything worse than dancing in the nude, he's shaken that the evidence exists.The bad guy offers Kyle a deal. In exchange for keeping the video and the potential rape allegation under wraps, Kyle must accept a position in New York City with the largest law firm in the world and steal documents related to a gigantic lawsuit between two defense contractors. High-stakes blackmail!The first few pages of this book are great, and I admit that I was immediately sucked into the plot. The pace slows as the book progresses. The bad guys patiently wait for the chance to have Kyle make a move. Meanwhile, Kyle spends most of his time trying to figure out how to outsmart them while also being the hardest working first-year associate at the firm. I don't know that the bad guys were actually super hard to outsmart. They actually seemed a little lame to me. When Kyle started his job, they demanded a look at his company-issued laptop and phone. He refused to do so, and they never bothered him about it again. Seems like pretty lame surveillance to me.***SPOILER ALERT (IF YOU CARE)***Somehow, Kyle manages to hire a lawyer, who notifies the FBI. They organize an operation to catch the bad guy when Kyle brings stolen files to him. But the bad guy somehow gets wind of it and disappears. And that's it. They don't catch him. So, who was this bad guy? Who was he working for? Why did they want the files? Where did he get the cell phone video? How did he know the FBI was coming for him? NONE of these questions get answered. Grisham suggests a bunch of possibilities, but I guess decides to let the reader ponder them eternally. It seems like maybe he wrote himself into a corner and said, \"Ah, screw it, I can't figure this out either. The end.\"***END OF SPOILER ALERT (IF YOU CARE)***I'm not the only one who feels this way. Many other readers are furious about this one. They can't figure out why he would just decide not to write the end of the book. There won't be a sequel, because who would buy it? Most people seem to think that Grisham is so rich he doesn't really care about pleasing the reader anymore. Others are speculating that The Associate was (gasp) ghostwritten.I'm glad that I checked this out at the library.

I'm pretty sure, however, that Grisham has a lot of much better things to offer in his more popular books. The thing that puts me off about this one is that things only stir up late (only until the start of the book's last quarter, I think). Before that, it's like he's just slowly making a big mound of anything; and you see, that's the part that's a little too boring."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1007827-jim", "userReview": "As usual with Grisham, I can't put a book down for very long until I've picked it up again.

The ending, though, did not have that same satisfying feel of a really good wrap up with all of the threads. I was thinking toward the end, How is Grisham going to wrap this up so quickly since there isn't much left. I found out that he just decided to leave some things hanging, which I really dislike.

This one was no different although I took major offense to how the author (and protagonist) handled the rape of Elaine. This is the reason I'm giving this book one star.I was having some serious issues with this as Grisham compares the case of college co-ed Elaine - who was in a compromising situation with our protagonist Kyle and his friends - to the heavily publicized Duke lacrosse case. Both cases were dropped, however, in the Duke scenario the plantiff was a stripper with absolutely no shred of evidence at all. In \"The Associate\" a video surfaces of Kyle's friends Joey and the troubled Baxter having sex with a girl who is so unresponsive Joey even has to ask \"Is she awake?\". I can't speak for anyone in the Duke lacrosse case, obviously, but Kyle's struggle with what he witnessed on the video clearly troubles him. But not enough so to face the music - after all, the video could potentially ruin the lives of the rapists, who in this case are his friends! She was a girl that liked to party, thinks Kyle. A major slut, says Joey, Elaine WANTED it. Oh! Then that makes it ok! The probably unconscious Elaine was begging for it, so it couldn't have been rape. And Joey has a baby on the way and a wedding to plan, going on trial for rape would be a MAJOR inconvenience. So Kyle and his buddies plot the best way to keep Elaine quiet while trying to appease the extortionists who own the video (and Kyle's future) - but Baxter still ends up dead. Awesome. And in the end, the slutty girl gets paid off to stay quiet and Kyle rides off into the sunset - on witness protection. For all the build-up and the potential this book had, I wasn't thrilled with how this one ended. Sorry, Mr. Grisham."}, {"userName": "Brittany Jedrzejewski", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3644418-brittany-jedrzejewski", "userReview": "\u201cIt\u2019s Criminal!\u201d I am a positive person and I feel bad about putting negativity out there, especially in a book review. I must say, however, that The Associate by John Grisham was a terrible book. I hadn\u2019t read anything by Grisham since The Firm and The Pelican Brief while in high school. At the time, they seemed like somewhat smart novels. I came across The Associate at Half Price Books and thought \u201cwhy not?\u201d Boy, has time changed the author\u2014and not for the better. My mom put it best, \u201che has a formula to his books.\u201d Meaning, he doesn\u2019t put much thought into the books other than to get them on the bookshelves as quickly as possible. Do lawyers even read these books or find them even mildly entertaining?In the book, a hotshot law student has two great job offers and a bright future, but a blackmailing expert team has found a skeleton in his closet and exploits it to the fullest in order to obtain highly confidential information. Only in the last 50 or so pages does the law student finally realize that he should just come clean and face the issue. Wouldn\u2019t a Yale law student know how to resolve the situation without having to work with the blackmailers? I have absolutely no law background, but I saw no evidence to even convict him!Character development was poor and the book was loaded with clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 and stereotypes (i.e. the hot law student who dressed really great and showed off her perfect body to the enjoyment of her male colleagues). The ending was horrifically lazy and unfinished. Looking at the bright side, I hope this review saved you a worthless read."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4877957-denise", "userReview": "Law student Kyle McAvoy is in a bit of trouble: Some shady characters have got hold of a secret from his past that could drag him to court and get him thrown in jail. He feels he has no choice but to go along with their demands: Take a job at one of the biggest law firms in the world and spy, steal and generally do a bunch of things that could get him thrown in jail on behalf of his blackmailers.I always forget that with Grisham the blurb tends to be a lot more thrilling than the actual book, potentially due to his extremely dry writing style that doesn't really let me connect with the characters at all. Apart from that, I really had a problem with the whole rape story (\"Alleged\" rape?! Nothing alleged about it, buddy, the girl was unconscious!!) and the way these entitled little assholes were talking about it and attempting to justify their despicable behaviour with the good old \"But she had sex with us before, so clearly she wanted it, never mind that she'd passed out...\" bullshit. The whole thing just made me cringe every time it came up and left me with very little sympathy for poor baby Kyle and his jerk friends. 2.5/5"}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41629146-carolyn", "userReview": "I'm spending two weeks in a place on Sanibel Island stocked with Grisham books...that's the reason for three in a week. (I brought The Alienist by Caleb Carr but have found it's not very \"beachy\" and requires more concentration than my brain has at the moment.) This book, The Associate, was oh so lame - the weakest premise, an insufferable protagonist who is smarter (at age 25 when everyone is still a bit of a moron...everyone except voice-of-reason Kyle) than EVERYONE around him - smarter than seasoned Ivy League lawyers, clandestine international operatives, feds: all no match for Kyle. No one is as clever and brave and glib as Kyle. Oh, and handsome, of course. A bad book. A book that makes your eyes roll in disbelief/disgust at the waste of time involved in reading this tripe. And if you have any interest AT ALL in answers to questions, mysteries, the ENTIRE whodunit...forget it. Nothing. Nada. At all.

The page-turning lure works but it does so by cheating. The Associate simply has too many loose ends. Building suspense and a sense of menace is not difficult if many of the suspenseful and menacing elements don't have to be explained. When Kyle McAvoy, the eponymous Associate, is blackmailed in the opening pages over an incident in his past (not that he was actually guilty of anything) he decides not to consult his lawyer father because Dad would say, \"Why didn't you tell me earlier?\" Which is exactly what he does say when he is consulted near the end and Kyle has to be extricated somehow. Convenient though that may be, it leaves so many unanswered questions the reader may suspect that the author didn't begin with a worked-through story line but with nothing more demanding than a wordage target. Once that is achieved, he simply stops. If the author cheats, the reader is cheated. And that is the feeling that remains at the end of a very poor story."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4144382-wendy", "userReview": "This is the first legal thriller I have ever read.
