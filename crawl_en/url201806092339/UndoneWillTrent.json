It's way too late for me to write a 10,000+ review, but I'm so fucking disgusted that I have to talk about it or I'll never sleep. Let's go to the point, okay? So. Genesis. Or Undone, whatever it's named. I'm so angry I can't see straight. So, so angry because I've been enjoying this series so far, including the beginning of this one, I've made excuses for the rampant sexism pouring through every page, and now I'm feeling so sick, I want to unread this book. The thing is, there's a tiny limit between picturing realistic, flawed characters and making me loathe every one of them. God, I had hopes for Will!However, that was before I knew that he was a fucking rapist.Yes, you heard me. You won't change my mind with the \"Angie is a manipulative bitch\" narrative, because you know what? Of course she is, I hate the woman, but that's very dangerous to draw lines when it comes to rape. There's NO woman on earth who deserves to be raped. I don't CARE if the book is telling us that oh, actually, she enjoyed it. SHE SAID STOP. SHE FUCKING SAID STOP. I will NOT feel sorry for Will. Was she on the verge of forcing his hand? YES. Would she have been an awful human being if she had managed to do it? YES. But why would Will be let off the hook? There's no such thing as \"eyes for an eye, and teeth for a tooth\" as far as I'm concerned, because then why would I care for him?? Why would I root for him? He's accountable for his actions all the same, and as much as I liked the guy, now he's like a itch I want to scratch. GO AWAY. Things go like this : she's trying to force his hand and manipulate him, he (understandably!!) tells her to leave. She doesn't. He then starts pushing her. She fights back. She pushes him on the floor. He holds on and pulls her down with him. He uses his force to keep her under him. And then : \n\"He grabbed both her hands in one of his, squeezing them together so she couldn't fight him. Without even thinking, he reached down and ripped away her underwear. Her nails dug into the back of his hand as he slid his fingers inside her.'Asshole,\" she hissed, but she was so wet Will could barely feel his fingers moving in and out. (...)'Stop it,' she demanded, but she was moving against his hand, tensing with each stroke. He unzipped his pants and pushed himself inside her. She tried to tighten against him, but he pushed harder, forcing her to open up.\"\nIn the end, she enjoys it and has an orgasm. I don't care. The fact that she's wet, that she has pleasure, doesn't change a thing, because we really don't need more scenes like these in medias, scenes in which no means yes. What the hell. Do I really have to explain why? WHY THE FUCK DO WE LET PEOPLE IMPLY THAT THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ANGER AND DESIRE ARE SO THIN? They aren't. Why are we excusing this kind of behavior? We need to stop dismissing this as 'rough sex' : that's not rough sex, that's rape.And THEN the guy dares think, \n\"He was so sick of this, so sick of the way Angie drove him to extremes\"\n Oh, no no no, you don't. You don't get to feel sorry for yourself and find excuses. Angie is bad news, but she's also been abused in the past. This doesn't excuse her behavior, but it doesn't excuse Will either because guess what, jerk, you are always responsible for your own actions. Again, I hate Angie, but no. No you don't. Even if she enjoys it after, it doesn't change a thing. Will is still this guy who forces himself on her and who doesn't stop when she asks him to and I don't want to read about that fucking guy.Yes, she wanted to have sex with him before their argument. But that's not how consent works. Consent can be withdrawn at ANY moment.  That's sex 101 for crying out loud. The issue is never addressed after because Will never acknowledges that what he did wasn't right. The narration implies that it's all Angie's fault, and I'm not here for that. Oh no I'm not.Secondly, what is IT with Faith's internalized misogyny? Amanda's? Is there ONE person in that entire book who doesn't act like a sexist pig? Actually, yes, there's Will. Right. Too bad he's our resident's rapist. I said before that I understood the need to picture a realistic world. But again, you can portray flawed characters without creating a world entirely filled with complete assholes. You can use your narrative to help dismantling stereotypes. It's called talent. Here it was sometimes done, but way too rarely for me. This is rape culture at its finest, where everyone including women think of women as petty bitches. The whole thing felt dehumanizing and that was very lazy storytelling.Finally : the victims. The way anorexia was handled felt very offensive to me, and I'm not sure why the parallel between their bitchy attitude and their eating disorder was drawn so tightly. I understand that it revolved around the killer's reasons for choosing them, but it still did not sit well with me. I just can't believe no one called Will out on his rape. I'm just - I'm feeling sick and I want to cry.For more of my reviews, please visit:"}, {"userName": "Karin Slaughter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10901279-karin-slaughter", "userReview": "First, people should know that in the UK and elsewhere, this book is titled Genesis, which was the original title I chose. (In the US, there was another book called Genesis--sci-fi--that was publishing around mine and they didn't want confusion). I chose the title Genesis because this was really a restart for Sara Linton. She's in a new city, she's completely changed her life, she's still recovering from the horrible events in Beyond Reach (weirdly, called Skin Privilege in the UK and other territories...) I felt very keenly that I needed for readers to mourn alongside Sara, but I couldn't let it be so raw that she couldn't actually function, so I set the story a few years after Beyond Reach. So, we hear about what she went though, but we also see that there is a light peeking over the horizon.This is also the first book where Sara meets Will Trent, which is something I had planned way back when I wrote Triptych. I see that book as well as Fractured (the only Will books without Sara) as Will's preparation for meeting Sara. He's starting to shake off Angie, he gets partnered with Faith Mitchell (whom I consider a grumpy Watson to Will's Holmes in that she makes him explain the things that are running around in his head and pulls him out of his shell), his relationship with Amanda is becoming more open...so, he's kind of learning how to be the sort of man that Sara would be interested in. And readers, too!SPOILER!I also write about a widow on Cop Town (June 2014) which I didn't realize until I had finished the book. What's this with me and widows? I guess I find it interesting, because how do you go on when you lose the love of your life? It doesn't seem possible, but people have to do it every day."}, {"userName": "\u2665Sharon\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12125670-sharon", "userReview": "I told myself I was going to write this review before starting Broken so here I am and I'm going to try and make it quick.Undone is my favorite so far of the Will Trent Series and I really should be taking the time to write a full review with perfect pictures but the next book is waiting on my Kindle! :)For me this was the most gruesome of the three books. As with the others the writing was gripping and captivating. It created such vivid thoughts for me which at times had me squeezing my eyes shut and chanting oh my god, oh my god\u2026 I guess I am a little twisted then to say that this is my favorite but it was. The plot centers on women who share common threads. Someone believes they should be tormented and that they don\u2019t belong. Some of the scenes are rather brutal and were difficult to read through. I had a constant feeling of dread. There are biblical references that make you stop and contemplate. I found myself completely immersed with Will and Faith as they set out to find this psycho.I continue to appreciate the development of all the main characters as well as the introduction of new characters. In Undone we meet Sara Linton. I\u2019m excited to find out where KS takes this character. She has some baggage she brings with her. Sadness and heartache that she desperately needs to let go of. I like her. Amanda continues to be a thorn in Will\u2019s side. Quite honestly, this woman is ruthless and at times dispassionate. Faith really shined in this one. I love her \"I don\u2019t take shit from anyone\" attitude. She wears it well. Her relationship with Will is starting to bloom both professionally and personally. She is good for him and that makes me happy. They haven\u2019t crossed the romantic line and I don\u2019t know if I would want them too. Time will tell I guess.And Will. There are so many shades of this man. With every book there is a little more revealed. I feel happiness and sadness for him all at the same time. He has ability to make me laugh and in this one he had the ability to make me cry. There was a scene towards the end of the book that I sobbed through....Will did not move for anything. He lay on the floor all night, until the sun coming through the windows told him it was time to go back to work. I want him; no I need him to be happy. \u2764Once again, I can\u2019t end my review without a word or two about Angie. My hatred continues. I get it already.

I had started this series when I realised that one of the character who was going to show up in this series already featured in the other series... Now I am a bit of a stickler for reading in order, so I had to stop this series and go back to the other. Confused yet??Will and Faith work for the GBI (Georgia Bureau of Investigation). These two. Lord above, they sure have some baggage and interesting pasts, especially Will. He is not even my typical hero/leading man but I do love him. I want to take care of him. I want him to have a lovely life... I want him to tell Angie to FUCK OFF.\nFaith was not really his type but she was an attractive woman, and attractive women could get away with a lot. Sara Linton, for instance, could probably get away with murder.\nWhen I started this series, I wasn't sure how the romantic theme was going to go.

Won't go into much detail. There are a lot of religious connotations also, which were interesting.We have some side characters who appear throughout the books. Amanda. Jeez, she's a bit of a bitch.

No \"waiting for the next one to come out\" anxiety!Before I had finished \"Fractured\" I KNEW I had to have \"Undone\"...and I wasn't disappointed. Slaughter came through for me again, with excellent suspense and a great cast of characters brought to life flawlessly and with depth.Having never read the 'Grant County' series, I was afraid the reintroduction of Sara Linton would either confuse me (because I'd never heard of her) or mess up what I think is great chemistry between my favorite Georgia detectives Will Trent and Faith Mitchell. But the author works these three characters together seamlessly. *for more about these characters, please see my (or anyone's) reviews of earlier novels. It should also be noted that you need NOT know the backgrounds of these characters to enjoy this book. Yes, it is part of a series, but EACH BOOK STANDS ALONE JUST FINE!I've recommended \"Undone\" to friends, but always with a warning: this is a tale of a dark, violent, SERIOUSLY twisted sociopath and Ms. Slaughter doesn't pull her punches. The book doesn't include ACTS of torture or violence, but certainly & thoroughly DESCRIBES the aftermath. The author's villain in this mystery/suspense novel is BEYOND demented and sadistic.Ms. Slaughter, I am learning, is an expert at leading her readers in so many directions--all connected, yet separate-- that during \"Undone\", at one time or another, I was SURE that everyone but the cops was the \"guy who did it\".

I can't read this fast enough. I loved the Grant County series. I could not read those books fast enough and I was so sad when that series ended with a BANG. But now I'm hooked with Will Trent and What! What! What! Sara Linton is in this book? Yes, Yes, and Yes!A young woman enters the Trauma center where Sara now works. After her husbands death, Sara has left Grant County and now works at a hospital in Atlanta. She is on duty when the naked, tortured woman is brought in for treatment. She literally shoves Will Tent out of the way in order to treat her patient. I loved this! Sara continues to be a strong female character.Will Trent is a the hospital with his partner Faith, when the tortured young woman is brought into he Emergency Room. He inserts himself in the investigation of what happened to this woman and bringing the perpetrator to justice. He treats the tortured woman with kindness and touches her foot tenderly which catches Sara's eye. He throws himself into the investigation and we get to see his brilliant mind at play. He continues to hide his dyslexia and fears it being found out by others. A little more is told about Will Trent. I have a feeling that with each book, a little more will be disclosed about him. Then there is his wife, Angie. I don't like her. I don't like her with Will. She is emotionally abusive. Why does he stay with her? Yes, they grew up in a group home together. Yes, she knows him better than anyone. But knowing someone and using their sad, horrible past as a way of hurting them does not for a healthy relationship make. Will Trent will not be the only character we learn more about, I have a feeling we will be seeing more of Faith in upcoming books. She is at the hospital receiving care (from Sara of course) and this opens up a story line for her as well. I like her attitude. We also get a little more of Amanda (Will's boos)in this one. Will is surrounded by strong women which makes his relationship with Angie so hard to swallow.The investigation of the tortured woman continues while another victim is quickly found by Will. Another woman goes missing and soon it appears that they missing women are similar in certain aspects. How do they all tie together? Who is taking them? What will happen next? Where will the beginning friendship with Sara take Will?Slaughter continues to dazzle with her character development. She continues to shine when writing carnage (is this a compliment) she does a good job giving us evil characters who do the unthinkable. She has a plot that is well thought out with twists and turns.

Also, the fact she calls Will stupid massively pisses me off, and is completely untrue, and yet Will believes it! A mate is supposed to build up, not tear down.

I love complicated and flawed characters and Will is one of those types that tugs at my emotions. This time around I got so frustrated with him and Angie, I wanted to throw the book across the room.

Having read quite a few of Slaughter\u2019s previous thrillers, I was expecting something dramatic by, oh, the second paragraph. So I was almost lulled into complacency when it hit me \u2013 or rather, when Henry Coldfield and his wife Judith hit a woman as they drove at dusk one evening. Thus began the heart-pounding, stomach-churning tale that is Undone.For those who have not finished the Grant County series, this book may contain spoilers, because Ms. Slaughter brings back Dr. Sara Linton. It is over three years since her husband Jeffrey was killed, and Sara has moved to Atlanta to work in the ER at Grady Hospital, away from her parents and her practice, away from whatever might remind her of her late husband. Sara, who feels lost and must somehow find meaning in her life again.This book brings together Sara, Special Agent Will Trent, and Will\u2019s partner Faith Mitchell. Each is flawed in his or her own way, and rather than judging their weaknesses, Ms. Slaughter seems to put the imperfections out there as if to say, \u201cit is what it is; deal with it.\u201d Somehow, each \u201cweakness\u201d becomes a strength, if not for that individual, then for the partner, as bonds are formed and strengthened. Call it forced compromise. Teamwork. Will is dyslexic. Faith learns that she is diabetic and pregnant. The two cops are polar opposites on the social skills scale, and each has problems there too. They have been partners for about a year at this point, and while they still drive each other crazy sometimes, at this point they seem to have an alliance that works well for them more often than not. It is the first time that Will and Faith meet Sara Linton, and this evokes some conflicting emotions for all as the story moves along.The two Special Agents and Dr. Linton meet at the ER. The woman who was hit by the car turns out to have escaped from a psychopathic kidnapper who tortured her and another woman in horrendous ways. We don\u2019t read these events as they occur, thankfully; just having them revealed after the fact is upsetting enough. The hunt for clues and suspects begins. There may be more victims. I had a good idea who the perpetrator was early on, but the story was more complex, of course, than what I could imagine. In true Slaughter fashion, there are moral questions to be faced \u2013 by the killer\u2019s family, by Will, by Faith, and even by the victims. There\u2019s no happy-ever-after ending either, even after the bad guy is caught.

The brilliancy of this series doesn't consist in the mystery/crime solving police procedurals - which are rather good, multilayered and gripping - but in the complex believable building of the characters, throughout every book. From an installment to another, I fell in love with her characters, and I still root for every single one of them, I feel their strenghts and their weaknesses, and I want for them all the happiness they can get. In Will Trent himself there's a total enigma, that interesting male character for any reader's liking, male or female, striking and flawed, broken, but hopefully redeemable.

One his wife loves to exploit.\n\u201cWho\u2019s Sara?\u201d\u201cSara Linton,\u201d Faith said. He shrugged, and she studied him carefully. Will never forgot names. He never forgot anything. \u201cThe doctor from yesterday?\u201d\u201cIs that her name?\u201dFaith resisted a \u201cCome on.\u201dHe asked, \u201cHow would she know how long Anna was kept?\u201d\u201cShe used to be a coroner in some county way down south.\u201dWill\u2019s eyebrows went up.

Okay. I'm starting to see it now. I don't want to get too excited and set myself up for possibly being blindsided by future irritations with this main character, but I definitely think book two's mystery coloured my feelings for Will. It was all around a really hashed up job and that rubbed off not only on the characters but on me as a reader. While in UNDONE all the victims are almost as equally unpleasant as the villain (on the one hand, it's awesome that you can't feel total sympathy for them because that's such a change, but on the other, jfc, Slaughter, give me someone to care about), and though Faith's bitchiness was somewhat due to health factors, Will was the shining star here. And oddly he was far from perfect, did a few questionable and seemingly out of character things, but nonetheless.. it worked. From an author who seems to thrive on creating unlikeable characters that I hate, she made the likeable one show signs of awfulness and created a dialogue surrounding the behaviour of doing wrong. And making sure not to repeat it. I loved it. So, yes, shining star. But he wasn't the only one. We had a blast from the Grant County past that I have long been expecting and.. wow. I hate to say it but I like her better now than I ever have before. I thought the introduction of this character, the tie-in to the other series, and the explanation of what has happened in the years since, so emotional. And I'm so hopeful for.. things. Even if Angie is still fucking things up and making those things seem unlikely. Also shoutout to Amanda for being stone cold ruthless and complete #bitchgoals.Really excited about this binge now."}, {"userName": "Piper", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10095424-piper", "userReview": "Another great Will Trent installment from Karin Slaughter, Undone certainly had me shuddering at times from the hideously gruesome things that were done to the female victims. These women already had deep seated issues but to be violated as they were was inconceivable. The perp was undeniably a sick SOB. What was almost even sicker was who knew what he was doing and kept silent about it. Yeah. What I love about this series, first and foremost, is Will Trent. He is, as others have stated before, an enigma. He is sexy in his own right, yet so flawed that he cannot see his way around it. I want more than anything for him to find and know true happiness.There were more sides of him revealed in this novel, yet I feel there is much more of him to be discovered. At least I hope so. Reappearing characters are Faith Mitchell, Will\u2019s partner, Amanda Wagner, Will\u2019s boss, and Angie. Faith has to deal with some personal issues in this story, but she is one tough gal, and I have no doubt she will overcome them. While she and Will are still struggling a bit in their communication skills with one another, they are making headway. I like Faith- she has a good heart. Amanda is a tough bitch, but she also takes care of her own when the need arises. It\u2019s suggested that she had to be tough to get where she is, and I\u2019ve no doubt that it\u2019s the truth. \u201dGlad to see you finally grow a pair,\u201d Amanda told Will. \u201cYou\u2019re suspended without pay for the rest of the week, but don\u2019t think for a damn minute that means you\u2019re going to stop working your ass off for me.\u201dNow Angie- she is just your basic, manipulative bitch. I gave her the benefit of the doubt in the first book, but not anymore. She does not play fair and I\u2019m getting really tired of her shit. Someone needs to teach her a lesson in goodbye. Finally, we are introduced to Dr. Sara Linton in this third book. She also has a past that haunts her. She wants to be released from it- to move forward, but doesn\u2019t seem to know how to do that. I very much hope that she finds a way.Lastly, there was one scene in this story that ripped my heart out. I don\u2019t want to give anything away, but the character that was portrayed in both Will and Faith when it happened really moved me. There were others parts as well that were tough to take. This was just as much an emotional story as it was gruesome, really. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the crime/suspense genre."}, {"userName": "\u2728Susan\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21276121-susan", "userReview": "Another good addition in the Will Trent series and by far the most gruesome in the series so far. Will and Faith are after a killer who kidnaps two victims at a time and keeps them under the ground in a hand made cave. The women endure horrible tortures, definitely not for the faint of heart. Faith has some health complications which lead her to Sarah, an ER doctor who is a character that comes from Karin Slaughters other series, Grant County. Sarah is known in the medical community for her knowledge in forensic science and is a nice addition to the series, however, she is a complicated and injured soul. A surprising twist at the end is frightening and especially dangerous for Will and Faith. All the usual characters are back and of course complicating Will's life."}, {"userName": "Jonetta", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta", "userReview": "It's been over three years since Sara Linton left Grant County following her personal tragedy and she's now working in Atlanta, back at Grady Hospital. Though she's moving forward with her life, it's still a slow pace. When she attends a woman who shows up in the ER, obviously brutalized, Sara is hurtled into an investigation that leads to more horror and Will Trent (he's not the horror!). This marks the intersection of the Grant County series and I was glad to see Sara reappear here. She and Will have an obvious connection, though not necessarily a romantic one yet. Their contributions to the investigation fit nicely and I liked the direction. Speaking of the case, this was a real puzzler and the lines between victims and perpetrators weren't always clear. It just made things that more interesting and maddening. I'm not sure what to make of it all but there was a lot I liked about the journey to the end. As always, the narration was excellent, drawing clear character distinctions and augmenting the story without overwhelming the narrative. I can't seem to get enough of this series, despite the occasional gruesome passage."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1877715-melissa", "userReview": "Well done, Karin Slaughter! I liked this a lot more than Fractured. Will is such an interesting character. I liked that there was a little more development of his character. I also like seeing the dynamic between Will, Faith and Amanda. The only reason I knocked a star off the rating is because I felt like the \"bad guy\"/resolution was rushed in to the last 50 pages of the story. That's probably the way it really works, but it would have been nice to have a few more hints earlier in the book.

Reading Triptych and Fractured made me a true fan of Slaughter's work.She is brilliant, her vivid portraits and dramatic, action packed criminal investigations leaves you sole shocked and craving more with every book.But me and my borderline OCD needed to read things in order and on noticing that a character from a previous series will be joining my favorites form the Will Trent series; I had to stop and obtain that series first. I July of 2015 I got hold of all the Grant County series and gobbled them down in quick suction, until Skin Privilege was spoiled for me. This discouraged me to complete the series and I totally lost my drive and crave for all the books.But in May I challenged myself to pick up Skin Privilege and finished it, needless to say it left me with a craving for the next books in the Will Trent series, but as 'Murphy' had it I didn't got to it until now.I'm glad thought. Not being able to read it till now and first getting Sara Linton's story form the Grant County series was all so very necessary for me. It feels like I know this catheters, like I'm friends with all of them. The back ground and the wait was exactly what I needed to get be fully addicted to Karin Slaughter again.I love how she draws you in with the characters and their quirks; and then keeps you on the edge of your seat with the thrill of the hunt and the mystery that keeps you guessing till the very end.So guess what I will be up to after reviewing this?O, and to make my day I've just realized that there is an eight book published just now!"}, {"userName": "Janie Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5116650-janie-johnson", "userReview": "This is book #3 to the Will Trent series and it is a mystery/thriller. I have to say I did enjoy the book, and the characters. It flows well with plenty of action and excitement.In this installment Will and Faith have to find and stop a serial killer who brutally manipulates his victims through starvation, torture and rape, all while dealing with their own personal issues. Who will be next?I really enjoyed the mystery to this installment. I think the story flowed well and had some pretty good 'edge of your seat' moments. I think the imagery was also really good with a great plot line while tactfully targeting eating disorders. So it had a great mix of different elements.I really like Will Trent a lot. He has some major issues with some that have not been touched on yet. I am eager to see if in upcoming installments we learn more about him. I also enjoy Faith's character. She is tough as nails and knows how to get the job done. A great mix of antagonists and protagonists that are well developed throughout the series.I recommend this book/series to any mystery lover. Slaughter pushes the limits between moral and immoral issues in her writing and I really enjoy that. Sometimes teetering on the darker side. I look forward to the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Vaso", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15818014-vaso", "userReview": "\u0393\u03bf\u03c5\u03b9\u03bb \u03a4\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4 \u03ba \u03a6\u03b5\u03b9\u03b8 \u039c\u03b9\u03c4\u03c3\u03b5\u03bb. \u0394\u03cd\u03bf \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b2\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ce\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf. \u0397 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac. \u0394\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03ba \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1. \u038c\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, \u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03af\u03c7\u03bf. \u0397 Karin Slaughter, \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c6\u03b9\u03c7\u03c4\u03ae \u03ba \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf! \u03a0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac, \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2...."}, {"userName": "Nat", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43639456-nat", "userReview": "Another perfect dark/twisted/gross cannot-put-down-until-it's-over Karin Slaughter novel.
