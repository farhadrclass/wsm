In some societies, they manifest as creation myths. In others, they look more like history textbooks. For example, as a kid in the United States, I grew up learning about the group of rebels who stood up to their British overlords and founded our country. It\u2019s human nature to be curious about where we come from, and origin stories unite people through a common history and shared sense of purpose.But what if all of humanity shared an origin story? What would that story look like? Historian David Christian tries to answer those questions in his new book Origin Story.As the creator of Big History\u2014my favorite course of all time\u2014David is well-suited to write about how we came to be. Big History tells the story of the universe from the big bang to the first signs of life to today\u2019s complex societies. It shows how everything is connected to everything else, weaving together insights and evidence from across disciplines into a single, understandable narrative.Origin Story is essentially the Big History course condensed into a short book. It divides 13.8 billion years of existence into what David calls \u201cthresholds\u201d\u2014moments in history that mark key transition points, like the formation of our solar system and the first appearance of early humans. The chapters about the early thresholds are heavy on physics and chemistry, but it skews more towards biology and anthropology as single cell life evolves into more complex beings.If you haven\u2019t taken Big History, Origin Story introduces you to its concepts in a straightforward, understandable way. David is a very good writer, and he has a way of making complicated subjects fun. If you\u2019re already a Big Historian, Origin Story is a great refresher. It does a fantastic job distilling the latest thinking about the origins of the universe. I learned some things that are simply too new to be included in the course.The book ends with a chapter on where humanity\u2014and the universe\u2014is headed. David is more pessimistic about the future than I am. He gets a little stuck on the current economic and political malaise happening in the West, and I wish he talked more about the role innovation will play in preventing the worst effects of climate change. But he nails the importance of this moment in history: \u201cThings are happening so fast that, like the slow-motion time of a near accident, the details of what we do in the next few decades will have huge consequences for us and for the biosphere on scales of thousands of years. Like it or not, we are now managing an entire biosphere, and we can do it well or badly.\u201dUnderstanding where humanity comes from is crucial to shaping where we go next. Origin Story is an up-to-date history of everything that will leave you with a greater appreciation of our place in the universe."}, {"userName": "Caleb Masters", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4163257-caleb-masters", "userReview": "A wonderful and relatively compact history book that does its best to tell the history of EVERYTHING, from the big bang to what the future may hold for us and our universe. Christian highlights various \"thresholds\" that our universe and then our species crossed to take history to its next big level. I admire his ability to synthesize information and present it in an easy digestible package for the reader. Fans of Harari's \"Sapiens\" and Tyson's \"Astrophysics for People in a Hurry\" will find a lot to enjoy here."}, {"userName": "Arun", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70419162-arun", "userReview": "excellent book that condenses the entire knowledge on universe into a delightful read"}, {"userName": "Teo 2050", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18069785-teo-2050", "userReview": "[Christian D (2018) (12:23) Origin Story - A Big History of EverythingPrefaceTimelineIntroduction\u2013 A Modern Origin StoryPart I: Cosmos01.

But what would it look like to study the whole of history, from the big bang through the present day -- and even into the remote future? How would looking at the full span of time change the way we perceive the universe, the earth, and our very existence?These were the questions David Christian set out to answer when he created the field of \"Big History,\" the most exciting new approach to understanding where we have been, where we are, and where we are going. In Origin Story, Christian takes readers on a wild ride through the entire 13.8 billion years we've come to know as \"history.\" By focusing on defining events (thresholds), major trends, and profound questions about our origins, Christian exposes the hidden threads that tie everything together -- from the creation of the planet to the advent of agriculture, nuclear war, and beyond.With stunning insights into the origin of the universe, the beginning of life, the emergence of humans, and what the future might bring, Origin Story boldly reframes our place in the cosmos.", "title": "Origin Story: A Big History of Everything", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204285-origin-story", "average": 4.19, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1523466867l/36204285.jpg", "reviews": 15, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/81809.David_Christian", "name": "David Christian"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/81809.David_Christian", "name": "David Christian"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "Science"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204285-origin-story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39306535-origin-story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/745703.Maps_of_Time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7956320-big-history", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3115456-this-fleeting-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18148219-big-history", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141844.A_History_of_Russia_Central_Asia_and_Mongolia_Volume_I"]}
