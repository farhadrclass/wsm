I could never relate to another person telling me  Look, these are the steps you need to take to better your life & if you don't take them you are done for !  Well, no book will be so absolute in saying so but underlying all the sugarcoating there is this message loud & clear in most books of this genre. Then however comes the matter of literature where a clever author without even giving you the faintest clue ties a blindfold around your eyes and walks you along telling you the story of a character & a quest. At some point (s)he pulls the blindfold off you & cries  There, you see where our character is right now ?  Then and only then do you realize the importance of the word self-discovery. Precisely what Saul Bellow does in this book !There is no patronizing in the words, no hollow advise on quick fixes you need to follow to discover the meaning of life. There is however a series of nerve wracking ordeals through which the guinea pig of a character named Eugene Henderson has to go through. Eugene is the oddball scion of an illustrious American family which counts State Secretaries, Scientists, Scholars & Lunatics among wealth and a solid ancestry. Eugene however is a totally different beast altogether, he is from rind to core a mass of confusion.When confronted with situations or emotions that threaten to get the better of him, he reacts in the only way best known to him : violence. He tries to find an inner meaning & solace in a lot of totally unconnected areas : Music, Sex, Soldiering, Alcohol, Farming but each tend to be a bigger disaster than the one preceding it. Eugene to me was very much akin to what a gorilla would have been in a glass factory. Leaving behind such a trail of shattered things, he escapes to Africa. It is among two of the most isolated of tribes : The Arnewi & The Wariri that the rest of his life story is penned.One amusing character I found in the tale was of King Dahfu of the Wariri. Eugene's interactions with the King give way to some of the most mind boggling & quote worthy prose in the book. The eccentric intelligence of the King rubs off on Eugene and the first tentative roots of transformation take hold in his character. Of significant presence for the principal protagonist is also the prophecy of Daniel on Nebuchadnezzar for at all phases in life, Eugene is closely linked to the lives of animals around him. The prose is extremly powerful and moving. While retaining the touch of a master wordsmith, Bellow creates extremely witty monologues especially in the earlier half of the book. This is easily a favorite for me !"}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "This is my first Saul Bellow book and while I didn't hate it, I didn't love it either.

Eventually the narrator will reveal a spark of humanity. Once or twice he will treat women as though they\u2019re almost human. And some of the author\u2019s descriptive flourishes will evoke genuine pleasure. But Bellow here wants it both ways: he wants to parody the Hemingway-esque hero type and he also wants page after page philosophical babble to be taken seriously. I couldn\u2019t do it. Over and over again I set this book aside never wanting to look at it again; I read review after review trying to appreciate what others saw; I forced myself to continue in an effort to understand its critical acclaim; but I'm still baffled."}, {"userName": "J.I.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/310055-j-i", "userReview": "This novel is staggering. It is the story, which we have heard so many times, of a bellicose foreigner who goes to Africa in order to find himself. But something is amiss. This isn't just some person who has lost their way a little bit, but someone that while good intentioned at times is a drunkard and a lout, selfish and violent; while he wants to be a good person, he simply isn't. Then he decides to ditch the tourist Africa and find the true heart of it in order to understand and heal himself, but when he arrives at a remote village with his guide and meets the prince of a very small and location, he is disappointed to hear him speaking English. \"We are discovered,\" the prince says, apologizing. What follows is a continued parody of the philosophical finding of one's self in a foreign country trope. Intentions to fix the villagers foolish superstition (as deemed by Henderson) lead to a larger disaster and another superstition (which, truly, he discovers, is merely a form of control for a group of powerful individuals) which leads him to being the Rain King. The ideas further collapse as in the heart of Africa Henderson is lectured in psychology and philosophy and biology by the almost-doctor King.With lush prose and richly rendered, flawed and three dimensional main characters, Bellow provides a satire that is surprisingly erudite and logical and it seeks to undermine the genre it is masked in not by silly exaggerations, but by subtle turnings of expectation. This slim volume is certainly one of the best books of the last fifty years."}, {"userName": "Nathan Isherwood", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/748718-nathan-isherwood", "userReview": "read more saul bellow. philip roth does. i hate the word romp. so let's say this book is all about personal exploration. henderson is opinionated, an american bull. he's in africa. he's being ugly and how you'd expect him to be. but he's the only one giving revelations and you couldn't imagine it any other way. he's like a teddy roosevelt mid life crisis tour guide. henderson's a brute with color. it's a search for the meaning of life with your dickhead uncle who owns a brand new chrysler. the worst part is - he finds it."}, {"userName": "Io?", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7224081-io", "userReview": "Strepitoso Bellow.

Oh, I can see that this will turn out well.Saul Bellow is one of those Big Literary Dudes I've never read, but by reputation I was expecting him to be kind of like Philip Roth or J.M. Coetzee (who I did not love) \u2014 lots of manly wangsting to the tune of Fond Memories of Vagina.Okay, let me dial down the snark. If you read Henderson the Rain King with your PC glasses off, it's actually a better book than I was expecting, with a certain exuberance and joie de vivre that endeared it to me. I'm pretty sure \"joie de vivre\" isn't actually what Saul Bellow was going for, as the protagonist is actually a rather depressive fellow, a middle-aged divorcee whose wife and kids don't understand him, a World War II combat veteran with scars of the sort that that generation never admits to, running off to Africa because despite being rich and comfortable, he can't get no satisfaction, a decade before Mick and the Stones. Actually, Henderson's constant internal refrain is I want, I want, I want, and he spends the entire book trying to figure out what it is he wants.But there is something I liked about that big galoot Henderson, despite the fact that he goes stomping around Africa like the blundering big-nosed American he is. He loves and respects the Africans he meets, referring to them unselfconsciously as \"savages\" but meaning it in a nice way, and otherwise never displaying any racial prejudices. Is he a great big schmuck? Yes, especially after his attempt to \"help\" the first tribe he meets goes disastrously wrong. Like the big impervious dumbass white man he is, he walks away unscathed, feeling very, very bad about it. He finds another tribe, becomes a friend and confidant of the king, becomes the Sungo, the Rain God, in an improbable feat that had me rolling my eyes (okay, seriously? You're gonna go there, Mr. Bellow?), but as it turns out, the tribe has been playing their own game all along, using the clueless white guy as an instrument in their machinations since he so kindly presented himself as a useful fool. That being said, just as Henderson has genuine affection for the Africans, in his oblivious, patronizing way, they have genuine affection for him \u2014 even if they are willing to literally throw him to the lions, should it come to that.Most of the book, though, is taken up with the inside of Henderson's head, which is a more interesting place than it has any right to be thanks in large part to Saul Bellow's writing.\"Sometimes a condition must worsen before bettering,\" he said, and he began to tell me of diseases he had known when he was on the wards as a student, and I tried to picture him as a medical student in a white coat and white shoes instead of the velvet hat adorned with human teeth and the satin slippers. He held the lioness by the head; her broth-colored eyes watched me; those whiskers, suggesting diamond scratches, seemed so cruel that her own skin shrank from them at the base. She had an angry nature. What can you do with an angry nature?Ah, why can't any SF authors write a space opera with prose like that?So this is a book about dudely dissatisfaction, yes, and it is kind of hard to feel sympathy for a millionaire who goes gallivanting off to Africa, deliberately seeking out the untouristed Africa and disappointed that there is so little untouristed Africa left. (As the first tribe he meets out in the hinterlands apologetically explains to him \u2014 in English \u2014 \"We are discovered.\") Bearing in mind this was written in the late 50s. Yet I did feel sorry for poor Henderson, and I even liked the guy. He makes a study of his own suffering, but he also tries to do right, ineptly but sincerely. And Saul Bellow paints him in big, bold colors, very much alive, very much complicated, an ultimately puny and comic human figure despite his vigorous strength and enviable wealth.My rating wavered between 3 and 4 stars, so I give it 3.5, and will round to 4. I didn't love it, but would not be averse to reading another of Bellow's works."}, {"userName": "Betsy Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5149179-betsy-robinson", "userReview": "This is bawdy, spontaneous, poetic writing. Eugene Henderson, an overblown, twice-married, millionaire pig farmer and violin player is having an existential crisis.\nI want, I want, I want, I want, I want!\nThis is the geshrei that drives fifty-five-year-old Henderson into and through a spiritual quest in Africa. He doesn\u2019t know what he wants, just that \u201ceverybody is working, making, digging, bulldozing, trucking, loading, and so on . . .\u201d until it is a form of madness. (I think he would be right at home in our time when value is quantified by how many \u201clikes\u201d we\u2019ve accrued.)Henderson the Rain King is a quest as complicated as any Haruki Murakami tale, but the protagonist is a bloated, bungling American\u2014a man with \u201cthe Midas touch in reverse.\u201d In Africa, his first stop is a village of people whose beloved cattle are dying of thirst because the water reserve is occupied by frogs. On one hand, Henderson wants to rescue everybody; on the other, he longs to be rescued:This was a beautiful, strange, special place, and I was moved by it. I believed the queen could straighten me out if she wanted to; as if, any minute now, she might open her hand and show me the thing, the source, the germ\u2014the cipher. The mystery, you know. I was absolutely convinced she must have it. The earth is a huge ball which nothing holds up in space except its own motion and magnetism, and we conscious things who occupy it believe we have to move too, in our own space. We can\u2019t allow ourselves to lie down and not do our share and imitate the greater entity. You see, this is our attitude. But now look at Willatale, the Bittah [highly evolved] woman; she had given up such notions, there was no anxious care in her, and she was sustained. Why, nothing bad happened! On the contrary, it all seemed good! Look how happy she was, grinning with her flat nose and gap teeth, the mother-of-pearl eye and the good eye, and look at her white head! It comforted me just to see her, and I felt that I might learn to be sustained too if I followed her example. (74)There was so much I could relate to in this wonderful book: the obsession with truth and purpose; the hopelessly flawed character of Henderson whose face belied every twisted thought and emotion; his chronic craving; and finally his exhaustion at the \u201ctoo-muchness\u201d of living with remedies for his predicament stymied by equal parts laziness, impatience for expanded consciousness, and terror of it. With so many references to mind-body medicine and scenes that will resonate for anybody who has practiced alternative therapies or body psychology, this feels like a modern book, although it was first published in 1959. I learned from the introduction that Bellow was practiced in (arguably the father of Western mind-body medicine) Wilhelm Reich\u2019s body psychotherapies, and much of that work and characterology shows up in the book\u2014a bonus for anybody with this knowledge.The writing is weighty, sometimes digressing in a kind of ADHD spasm, and Bellow lacks the precision I so admire in, my hero and Bellow\u2019s contemporary, John Cheever, and the meticulous cleanliness that makes Murakami\u2019s books so easy to read. But so be it. What he offers is worth the sometimes-exhaustion of the reading effort: a full-blown spiritual quest, from despair to acceptance of our moving gross-body experience of life."}, {"userName": "Stela", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela", "userReview": "I am a steady admirer of Saul Bellow and this since I read, some thirty years ago, \u201cHumboldt\u2019s Gift\u201d.

It happened every afternoon, and when I tried to suppress it got even stronger. It said only one thing, I want, I want! And I would ask, 'What do you want?' But this was all it would ever tell me.\nI've never been to Africa. I'd love to though - if anyone wants to float me a one-way ticket to Ouagadougou, maybe a layover in Z\u00fcrich to pick up some luxury essentials, I'd be mighty grateful. But I digress, I've never been, and what I know of it I basically know from \"Out of Africa\" starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, or from Things Fall Apart or Heart of Darkness - so essentially I know nothing of it whatsoever. But in any case, it has had, and still has, a sort of mystical quality of the unknown, of spots which we believe have eluded cartographers and adventurers alike. There's a romance in the unknown, the untrammeled, and that romance is the central figure of Henderson the Rain King, Saul Bellow's novel about a rich but dissatisfied man who seeks the meaning of life in the African plains. Saul Bellow admonished readers not to look for symbolism, in what is a preposterously allegorical work. It is almost impossible not to see symbolism everywhere in this book, in fact it would take a deliberate skepticism to avoid it. So why the warning? Maybe it is because the overflowing symbolism reminds us of another novel, taking place in Africa, also brimming with symbols? Maybe one by an author that Bellow admired, like, say, Joseph Conrad? Of course! I saw much of the symbolism of Henderson the Rain King to be a parodic point-counterpoint for Conrad's controversial depictions of Africa in Heart of Darkness, particularly his representation of the natives. In Bellow's reversal on themes, instead of trying to bring order to the African chaos, he seeks in Africa a stability of meaning in his own internal chaos. While Henderson's expectations of the African experience are clearly influenced by a Conradian view of the continent and its aboriginals, the novel as a whole evades the stereotypical trap by refusing to characterize \"Africa\" but instead keep it firmly in the backdrop. Henderson's views are quickly overturned, churned, and reversed as he meets African tribesmen who speak English and are trained in medicine. Henderson the Rain King is about a modern transcendental quest, \u00e0 la Thoreau's sojourn on Walden Pond. Following in the philosophical tradition of Emerson and Whitman, Bellow through Henderson argues in favor of the human capacity to transcend state inertia of the Self, to metamorphose to a state unimaginably changed from one's original. Henderson elucidates this change as from a \"pig state\" to a \"lion state,\" or perhaps he falls short of the leonine ideal, but a fully changed man he is, nonetheless. This change is brought about masterfully in the sub-Saharan chrysalis of the novel. The change is great, but incomplete, Henderson becomes man qua man: he remains imperfect, but changed for the better - the same man with a violent imagination and a youthful impetus but with a changed perspective, a human optimism which abandons his erstwhile melancholy to the realm of the past.Without Africa, I feel transcended beyond previous Selves. From the solipsistic and ill-behaved child to the melancholic perturbations of my high school spirit to the Self I have become today, I am a fully different individual, and all has been the result of changes in perspective. Unlike Henderson, these permutations of the spirit are naturally occurring transitions of youth: Henderson is a middle-aged man, and perhaps it takes so stark a change in venue to spark so vital a change in spiritual vitality. This book is a book of continuous conflict, on the surface it is a conflict between the impetus of the Self and the desire of change (ultimately a clash of desires), but deeper questions surface, combative questions of the physical versus spiritual selves, reason versus emotion, death and immortality, body and soul, and Self versus Society. Is it possible to make a drastic change to the Self in the midst of the the fierce tributary of modern society's desires and temptations? That question isn't wholly answered, because Henderson is always in a state of escape from Society. He lives outside Danbury on a pig farm before his journey to the African continent, far reclusive from the mainstream of society. When you feel out of sorts, escape feels a necessity for life, no solitude is solitude enough. But Henderson relents, Henderson finds solace in the masculine companionship he finds in his African guide, Romilayu, and in his spirit guide, King Dahfu of the tribe Wariri. While solitude and remoteness seems an ideal, it seems that change is impossible in a vacuum, we need people to catalyze our changes. Africa doesn't change Henderson, rather the men he meets there help to reveal to him his true capacity of heart, his true capacity for good, his veritable capacity to change.But there remains in the background a beauty of experience, which commingles a beauty of the natural and a beauty of the human. I love nature, and I find no better escape into myself than to get out into the forest, to go for a run in the glaucous shade along the Charles River esplanade. But that natural beauty is remote in its purest form, it is a beauty which transcends our complete appreciation and the essence of what it gives to us lies just beyond the ability of our natural language of praise and awe. Natural beauty needs the human element, imperfect analogues and the unnatural beauty of language, to pin it it down, anesthetize it for us to appreciate, like a butterfly on cardstock; Bellow does that for us with a moving ability, but rather than sedating it, he breathes a life into it. Bellow elucidates our human short-comings to appreciate natural beauty:\nWe are funny creatures. We don't see the stars as they are so why do we love them? They are not small gold objects but endless fire.\n All beauty: natural, humanistic, aesthetic - all beauty is alive. Our materialist society has an unnatural desire for that which is eternal, but we find those pleasures empty, they don't fulfill us - they are unnatural, they are dead pleasures. Wallace Stevens in \"Sunday Morning,\" another tribute to the mystical power of a natural spiritualism, ponders:\nIs there no change of death in paradise?Does ripe fruit never fall?\n and answers: \nDeath is the mother of beauty\n Death, mortality, is what makes the world beautiful. The eternal is not beautiful and can never fulfill us. Money, material goods, is immutable, fungible, of an exact value - it lasts forever, so long as we hoard it. Nature cannot be hoarded or safeguarded in our purses and wallets, it slips ever through our fingers if we do not take it into our selves. We must ever grasp for it, appreciate it, love it and preserve it. All that is beautiful must die, life must end, but I wouldn't trade in life and I wouldn't trade in the beauty of endless fire (an allusion to Prometheus's gift) for the material glister of \"small gold objects.\""}, {"userName": "Elham", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22013187-elham", "userReview": "\u0627\u0648\u0646\u0642\u062f\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u062c\u0644\u062f\u0634 \u0627\u0632\u0634 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646\u060c \u062c\u0630\u0627\u0628 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a. \u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u0641 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0646\u0634 \u0647\u0645\u0686\u06cc\u0646 \u062d\u0633 \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0645\u060c \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0633\u0631 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0647 \u0632\u0648\u0631 \u062a\u0645\u0648\u0645\u0634 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0645."}, {"userName": "Evandro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8010832-evandro", "userReview": "Eis um livro surpreendente.

I started with his first, The Dangling Man (1944) and moved along. I don't know that he is currently read much (and I don't know why), but I just love his novels. I would think that an author who won three National Book Awards, a Pulitzer, and the Nobel Prize should be an American treasure.Henderson is a character who could only have been created by Bellow. Larger than life, literally and figuratively, socially embarrassing, personally challenged as a husband and a father, and richer than Croesus, he moves through life leaving a wake of disaster.Due to various events including having become bored of being a pig farmer, Henderson decides to go to Africa, looking for adventure and personal redemption. He finds both, his well-intentioned but calamitous antics among the natives affording him access to tribal royalty.As I read on, enjoying every page, I began to see that simmering below the picaresque and the improbable was satire of the highest order. Is this the year I learn to understand and appreciate satire? It keeps popping up in the most unexpected novels and I have learned that it must be tastefully done or it drives me mad.So in 1959, Bellow published a novel that spoofs the mid-life crisis, the search for personal fulfillment, the African safari, and the American can-do attitude. At the same time, Henderson actually resolves his mid-life crisis, finds personal fulfillment, has the best ever safari (yes, there are lion hunts), and refines his American bull-headed ways.How did he do that?"}, {"userName": "Simona", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6222130-simona", "userReview": "Non \u00e8 stato facile leggere questo libro: un po' perch\u00e9 lo stile di Bellow \u00e8 a tratti ripetitivo e prolisso e anche perch\u00e9 dovevo abituarmi al suo stile.

Eugene Henderson's macho character was modeled after another famous E. H. This E. H. was a boozer, went to Africa and carried his macho weight around like a club as does Eugene Henderson, and at times, wanted to blow his brains out. As many people of the day went off to Africa - however, notes Henderson, 'man goes into the external world, and all he can do with it is to shoot it?' Eugene just wants to set the record straight, with himself, because he's grown too fat and feels disgusted, with everything.It's not that Eugene doesn't have everything, because he does. He's inherited a lot of money from his father's estate, he has a wonderful old family home where he raises pigs. He has a wife (second) and lots of children who he rarely bats an eye to. He also strives to play the violin, the same one his father played. But he is a blustery, miserable, drunken sod who yells and carries on - owing to the craving that he is constantly in want.Eugene Henderson decides finally that he has to go to Africa or die in bed. Those are his options. Africa is a wake up call as travel is to live and experience things that one is not accustomed to. He of coarse blunders his way around and is always searching for a foothold. He wants answers and he wants someone to see him for who and what he truly is. And he wants his life to have meaning and purpose. The second African tribe he settles in with (after botching the visit to the first tribe), he makes a good friend in King Dahfu. The king is also in transition trying to abolish some of the old, superstitous ways of his tribe as he is educated and does not rely on superstition alone as the tribe tends to-however, he walks a very fine line.I found this book to be full of little gems such as the allusion to Walt Whitman (Enough to merely be! Enough to breathe!) -\"Being. Others were taken up with becoming. Being people have all the breaks. Becoming people are very unlucky, always in a tizzy. The Becoming people are always having to make explanations or offer justifications to the Being people. While Being people provoke these explanations...Enough, enough. Time to have become. Time to be. Burst the spirit's sleep...\" I like this sort of thing.Eugene's character grows, he tries to get passed becoming and he realizes the importance of things he took for granted and he also comes to terms with the past and with his own imperfections as a human being. This is a funny book at times, but it wasn't hilarious to me because I realized that much of Eugene's blunders come from his good intentions and from pain itself, but of coarse much of it all is self inflicted and comes from an over inflated ego. At times, Eugene reminded me of Ignatius Reilly with his blowhard, blustery ways of blundering. But throughout the book, I liked him. He does have a good sense of humor.I really enjoyed this book, might not be for all, but if you enjoy a work that speaks for the ages, this is one. Saul Bellow seeks to answer the spirit's call and awaken the soul in the midst of mediocrity, boredom, and uncertainty in an age of material possesions and he does a fine job of it throughout his entire oeuvre.

Ah, s\u00ec, partiamo con il dire che Saul Bellow \u00e8 uno di quegli autori che piacciono a me, uno di quegli americani che hanno aperto, spesso inconsapevolmente, le porte al postmodernismo, un po\u2019 come John Barth o Philip Roth o DeLillo, gente che un giorno, subito dopo la seconda guerra mondiale, si \u00e8 messa alla propria scrivania e ha iniziato a buttar gi\u00f9 storie che ritraessero i propri contemporanei, spesso da un punto di vista imparziale, a tratti volutamente cinico e/o umoristico, riconducendosi idealmente alla cultura dei decenni precedenti ma rivisitandola (e in alcuni casi stravolgendola) in chiave moderna. Saul Bellow, canadese naturalizzato statunitense, pubblica \"Il re della pioggia\" (quinto di una bibliografia che conta quasi una ventina di libri) nel 1959, un libro di poco meno 400 pagine in cui ci racconta l\u2019esperienza del signor Henderson, miliardario che si comporta \"come un barbone\" e che, ad un certo punto della sua travagliata vita, costituita da due matrimoni e un imprecisato numero di figli, decide di partire per l\u2019Africa. Qui si immerge in un continente a lui del tutto nuovo, dove a contatto con popolazioni primitive si trova a dover far fronte ad inaspettate avventure, avventure che hanno lo scopo di smuovere l\u2019animo di questo rozzo miliardario un po\u2019 trasandato, esempio dell\u2019uomo moderno alla perenne ricerca del vero significato della vita. Divertente nella prima parte, in cui potremmo associare lo stile di Bellow a quello dei primi lavori di John Barth, pi\u00f9 lento e \"meditativo\" nella seconda, \"Il re della pioggia\" \u00e8 un libro sicuramente consigliato, forse non il capolavoro di Bellow (ma parlo io che ho letto solo questo \u2013 \u00e8 che spero di essere smentito da altri libri ancor pi\u00f9 riusciti), ma sicuramente consigliato, questo s\u00ec.
