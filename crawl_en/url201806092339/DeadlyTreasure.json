{"ratings": 1, "userreviews": [], "description": "Aboard the cruise ship, Roaming Dreamer, Diana Hunter, is about to encounter a level of adventure and danger far beyond anything described in a luxury cruise ship brochure. In 1949 her uncle, Bennett Hunter, escaped pursuit aboard a freighter departing from Los Angeles Harbor and took with him a sea chest with five priceless works of art. By the time his freighter saluted Lady Liberty in New York Harbor, the chest was empty, the art safely hidden. Now, someone wants the hidden art found, and they believe that Bennett's heir, Diana, can find it for them. Holding her father hostage, they shanghai Diana aboard a ship that will trace the route taken by Bennett. With her father's life the price of failure, Diana must decode her uncle's cryptic notes and search each port of call for the art. Joining in the hunt will be her past partner and lover, Nelson Langly and Abbie Winter, a mysterious friend of Diana's father.", "title": "Deadly Treasure", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17987773-deadly-treasure", "average": 3.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369946879l/17987773.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2645843.Joan_Francis", "name": "Joan Francis"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17987773-deadly-treasure", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5947985-old-poison", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5837973-silent-coup", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30977265-how-hitler-seized-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10097324-corporatocracy-rules", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35157500-dating-and-courting-with-godly-purpose"]}
