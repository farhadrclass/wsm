Because stupid stuff happens. The world has basically ended because of some solar flares that shut off the energy system and the nuclear plants all went cookoo for cocoa puffs. Except for a select few people. The Preppers and some of the government all were prepared and had made elaborate hives underground. But before the government folks went underground they had to appease all the people that they were leaving behind and so they release an untested vaccine for radiation called ARV-3.Fast forward thirteen years. Abi is the teen Mary Sue of our story and she has been living underground all these years with her family and some other people. Her hive has been supporting several people all this time. Food for this many people just is hard for me to wrap my brain around but we will over look all that for the sake of my not being a bitch.In the meantime Abi and her family and all the survivors have all been training with weapons and all that jazz. Because might as well.Her father is the leader of this little hive and he has been in contact with the government peoples and now they have been testing all the soil and air and decide that it's pretty safe for people to leave their hives and join up to fight the good fight of re-starting the world.Then they find out that there are creatures up there. (Not a spoiler-calm down)..these creatures are the people that were just lucky enough to get that vaccine. They have mutated into a whole new ballgame of things. They also think people are tasty.\nWe wouldn't have a story if Ali and her crew didn't plan on heading Topside to try and reach more survivors so you know what happens then.BUT before that we need a luurve interest. Throw in Finn. He and his mom are part of Abi's hive and she has been his friend all these thirteen years but right before they head out to fight the baddies this crap happens.\n*Gag*Anyways I'm not a fan. I liked the Arvies (the baddies) and thought this book could have been really good. It has a pretty decent premise but the characters were just sort of cookie cutter and frankly I was hoping for them to get eaten.Then you have the way that they get out of problems. There will be a snot storm a brewing and what do they do? They will fight but if that doesn't work say a prayer-miracle then occurs. My eyes rolled so hard that I flipped off the couch at one point. Then I look and there are many more books in this series....\nBooksource: Netgalley in exchange for review."}, {"userName": "Ben Alderson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15850647-ben-alderson", "userReview": "WOWTHISNEEDSTOBEAMOVIEThis was an extremely amazing book, think I Am Human / silos / romance / EVERYTHING AMAZING IN A POST APOCALYPTIC BOOK!

The good: I found the apocalyptic / post-apocalyptic world interesting but I was not convinced by the concept. According to the story, a massive solar storm wiped out all electricity on the planet. The following Nuclear fallout wiped out life on the planet, except for a few thousand humans who took shelter in underground bunkers across the globe. When the ejection is directed towards the Earth and reaches it as an interplanetary CME (ICME), the shock wave of the traveling mass of Solar Energetic Particles causes a geomagnetic storm that may disrupt the Earth's magnetosphere. Coronal mass ejections, along with solar flares of other origin, can disrupt radio transmissions and cause damage to satellites and electrical transmission line facilities, resulting in potentially massive and long-lasting power outages. So far so good. But, it takes 17h for a solar flare to reach Earth. There would have been enough time to switch off potentially dangerous atomic power plants.  But let\u2019s go with the story and assume all those scientists at NASA, ESA & Roskosmos, haven\u2019t seen it coming, and the solar storm was like a GIANT GLOBAL EMP and everybody on this planet just wakes up without ANY electricity and EVERY SINGLE nuclear power plant was going to go Chernobyl on us. Life on Earth wouldn\u2019t be over. Life in Europe and USA would be over. But let\u2019s have a look at a picture of nuclear power plant around the glove: There is not a single red dot in Alaska and Canada, Africa, South America, Australia, large parts of Russia and Asia. Why not evacuate people to these countries, with sailboats and steamboats if need be. But let\u2019s just go with the story. There are big, government hives and some small \u201cfamily\u201d hives, build by those who prepared for exactly this end-of-the-world scenario. How people can survive 13 years in a bunker is beyond me. The amount of dried fruits and noodles to feed 15 people for almost 5000 days\u2026 wow... is simply unbelievable. The amount of toilet paper alone is unthinkable! I found it not nearly enough explained how people survived that long without sunlight, without access to the surface in an underground bunker. Now, after thirteen years, people finally are able to return to the topside only to find the world full of aggressive mutants. I have to admit, I did enjoy the Arvies. They are crazed, milky-eyed creatures who have developed a deep hatred towards all survivors over the last decade and they totally like to bite and rip them apart. Also there is more to them than a Zombie-like almost dead status on the surface. They are feeling, communicating and strategizing human-like creatures. And they want revenge for what the government did to them. That was the best part of the book because you never know when one or several hundreds of them are going to pop out behind you. There\u2019s a lot of action with guns, bombs and snipers. Loved it! Apart from this the story didn\u2019t appeal to me on every other level. Almost all characters are very clich\u00e9: you have the ex-Navy Seal uncle who is depicted like a middle-aged Rambo, there is her Mom who constantly panics, her grandparents were kind of forgotten after their introduction, same with Abi\u2019s cousin that never even gets mentioned again in the entire book! the people in the government hive were even more clich\u00e9 and absolutely nobody contributed in any way to the story. That was kind of a letdown. It felt like the potential of group dynamics under pressure was totally wasted. The interactions remained unfortunately shallow and sketchy which also left gigantic-sized opportunities for plot holes that were filled by \u201cdeus-ex-machina\u201d, literally. I have nothing against religion, but please spare me with prayers that are being answered and all the talk about karma and fate. There are like 3 major events where they are up to their ears in a shit storm and would you believe it, they pray to God and salvation comes. Unrealistic much? Have I mentioned the romance? No? Shame on me! How could I forget to tell you about ohmygodhejustlookedatmeisn\u2019theawesome FINN. Finn who will always love her, be there for her, who even gives her an engagement ring, who kisses her senseless, love-lost. Kill me please! It was a lot of telling instead of showing involved. If not for all its faults, Abi\u2019s ass-kicking character, the action and interesting drafted Arvies would have been enough to grant at least 1 or two stars more. But despite my misgivings, I am still interested in the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/667272-christine", "userReview": "One-word review: Absurd.Longer review:A completely implausible (both scientifically and sociologically) dystopian teen drama with a flat main character and secondary characters whose motivations were not well established. 1. Nuclear power plants are not atomic or nuclear bombs. This is an extremely common misconception, and I was willing to forgive it if the rest of the book was good. It was not. 2. The first few chapters were told as a massive information dump that failed to establish the profound impact being raised in a small underground bunker would have on a girl, nor did it do anything to establish the extremely close-knit relationships that would undoubtedly be formed between 15 people living in such close proximity. 3. Those 15 people had no new babies in 13 years. There is no form of birth control in existence with an expiration date lasting that long and the small bunker didn't exactly have the facilities to manufacture new options. And despite the need to conserve food, I'm not convinced it was desirable not to begin the reproduction of humanity within that bunker. (That second point is debatable. The first is not.)4. The main character suddenly notices how hot Finn is just before they leave the bunker, when she's 17 and he's 19. Wow, she went through puberty late! Come on, get real! This isn't high school and I don't care if you've thought of him as your best friend growing up. You have hormones. He has hormones. You're confined in close quarters in an intense survival situation. You didn't *just* notice him. 5. When they leave the bunker, they are met by zombies (who took an anti-radiation vaccine that mutated them). These zombies have done more than survive radiation -- they have survived the complete destruction of all plant and animal life on the planet and the fact that they like to eat one another. Wow.6. As Abby and Finn travel to the new government bunker, there is a painful love story unfolding in which he gives her a promise ring like they're in middle school. There's no reason the two can't just say they're married. What are they waiting for? A state-issued license? It's a harsh world and you're going to grow up quickly. If you want to get married, declare it and it's done. That way when you get to the new bunker you don't have to worry about the nonsense about boys and girls being separated and you can instead settle in the married bunk.7. The delay in training women for warfare in an intense survival situation was also unbelievable, although I do believe that with only a few thousand humans left, you wouldn't want to send the girls out if at all possible. 8. The social dynamic of the girls in the new safe zone bunker was difficult to swallow. I didn't understand any of the forces driving it, why Abby made an enemy within two seconds of entering, why she made a best bud in those same two seconds, etc. Eva's eventual apology made no sense either. I do enjoy dystopian and apocalyptic scifi. This is not a good one."}, {"userName": "Stuart Keane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29924908-stuart-keane", "userReview": "First of all, I'm going to ignore the fact this book is aimed at Young Adults, purely because I don't read Young Adult books and focusing on it too much might ruin the review. Crap, did I ruin it already? No, okay. With that aside, let's approach the book in my normal way.ARV-3 is phenomenal. That's right, pure and simple. I'm a sucker for a dystopian thriller and this book ticks each and every category that enables this to flourish as such. Bleak themes? Check. Tragic Earth-crippling catastrophe? Check. A small group of characters that come together in order to rescue their planet from an otherworldly - or in this case, home-grown - menace? Check. Realistic characters that enforce face palms and vehement \"don't do that\" reactions from the readers? Check. The sinister power-hungry individuals that think the world is their oyster now it's been decimated? Check.It's a lot of checks, something necessary in order to pull off a story of this magnitude. Part conspiracy thriller, part romance, very Young Adult in it's approach but with plenty for the mature, adult reader, ARV-3 hits all the correct notes. Dystopian thrillers can verge on the epic (The Stand by Stephen King is one example, excellent) but the problem with epic is the ability to get lost, go too far too quickly and lose track of the books goal. Characters suffer and readers tire easily. The author doesn't do this, reigning in the story to a select group of people, people we can care about and watch develop before our very eyes. The author instead uses this book as the first chapter in what looks to be an engaging, must-read series, which means the characters can develop at a leisurely pace over a period of time, without being crammed into one volume. Told from the first person, we learn everything as it happens through the eyes of our seventeen year old protagonist, Abi. It works perfectly, building tension, terror and that nagging ability that, despite the monster threat on the Earth's surface, humans are still the biggest threat to the future of the world. This is what a dystopian thriller should be; human, but with the right amount of horror, the fear of the unknown and outright discovery. Abi may seem na\u00efve to some readers but don't forget, we're seeing everything with her for the first time. You'd be the same if stuck underground for thirteen years too. And she's seventeen for God's sake. It's examples of realism like this that hook you and keep you turning the pages.There's one more thing this book has going for it. A love story. It may seem clich\u00e9 to root a love story deep within a tale of tragic loss, devastation and apocalyptic undertone but the movies do it all the time and it occasionally works. For ARV-3, the love story is paramount, vital and important. Without it, the book would be a bunch of people running around and shooting monsters. And everyone's done that before. What Cameo Renae (awesome name by the way) does is to inject some humanity into the proceedings, which in turn lifts ARV-3 from a standard dystopian thriller to an out and out blast. Clich\u00e9 well and truly diminished. 5*? Absolutely. I've not seen/read a more realistic dystopian thriller since the Fallout video games, something I had in mind the entire time I was reading this. Renae has created an original world, one so bleak, violent and unforgiving that any hope of humanity is a god-send. The characters, dialogue and scenarios are played out excellently and you will find yourself catching breath after some of the action set pieces. I hear a movie is in the works for this...I can't bloody wait!I popped my modern Young Adult cherry with this book and it was very special. I'm glad I waited.

This review can also be read at The Nightly Book Owl. It seems as if those infected with the ARV-3 serum survived the apocalypse, but there were major side effects. There was something in the serum which caused them to mutate. They have become violent cannibals.The creature was completely hairless, and its skin creased with countless wrinkles, appearing scabrous and leathery. It was horribly pale. Purplish blue veins protruded and snaked all over its body.You can probably tell that this is a book about an apocalyptic world where a virus has spread. A serum that was supposed to save the people that were not fortunate enough to get to a hive underground turned them into cannibalistic monsters instead. Think The Walking Dead but with faster zombies/mutants. Overall, I thought this book was okay, but damn did I love the scenes with the mutants, called Arvies. I love the action, the chase, and the feeling of being trapped. This book got me in the mood to read other zombie books because it keeps you on your toes. You never know when an Arvy is going to pop out of nowhere, and eerily enough they\u2019re not brainless. They communicate. That was, hands down, the best part of this book. There were guns. There were swords. There were bombs. In other words, I love the action. For this reason, it is a shame that the second half of this book took such a drastic turn. It went from being a kickass survival story into an average teen drama. Action was still there at times, but I wasn\u2019t kept in suspense. I wasn\u2019t itching to read what was next because it didn\u2019t have the same feel or atmosphere at all. I would have easily given this book a three or four stars, but because of how average I thought the latter part of the book was, I cannot bring myself to do so.Just as I had it focused in my sites, its milky white eyes snapped up to me. What the --? It took me off guard, and was freaking me out, because its eyes never left me. It suddenly bared its teeth, and then\u2026 It held up its decrepit fingers, like a gun, and pretended to shoot me! This is the kind of stuff you find in the first half of the book.\u201cOMG! Are they hot?\u201d She whispered giddily, taking hold of my shoulders.I hesitated. OMG. Was she serious?OMG! Was he freaking serious.This is the kind of stuff you find in the second half of the book. Abi, the main character, and her friend Tina are constantly snickering and giggling, and it just takes away from the whole feel of the book. OMG yeah.The romance in this book wasn\u2019t very interesting. I just never had a chance to see them as being romantically involved before the main character spelled it out for the reader. What happened to subtlety? I do, however, love the tight-knit group. Even though they\u2019re not all blood related, they act as a family, protecting one another no matter what, and it\u2019s very touching. I love the family dynamic going on here, and it\u2019s one of the best parts of this book. Plus, Abi is pretty kickass. Overall, I am interested in seeing how this plays out, but at the same time, it\u2019s not on my top priority. In the next installment, more action and Arvies would be great.

I was a bit worried when I saw it was post apocalyptic, but that went away after the first page. I was immediately wrapped up in these character's and wanted to learn all about them and their lives. I became completely lost in their world and grew to love and care for all of them. They are met with challenges that we couldn't begin to know what to do with and together they meet the challenges they are faced with. Teenage rebellion is alive and well as we see this story through the eyes of a 17yr old girl. Her past 13yrs were spent in a hive(shelter) and she doesn't even remember what the real world looked like anymore. She longs to feel the sun on her face and the wind in her hair.Spoiler alterI have to admit reading about the garden of Eden was my favorite part of the book. Cameo uses such amazing ways to describe this chapter that you are right there experiencing every moment with them.

Renae has added an intriguing but disturbing twist to this plot because the antagonists aren\u2019t merely zombies infected with a virus who\u2019ve risen from the dead to wreak havoc on the survivors. Instead, they are living, breathing humans who have, over time, mutated into frighteningly violent, animalistic creatures after they took an untested anti-radiation vaccine hastily distributed by the government prior to the planet\u2019s nuclear meltdown. Although the majority of the population was unprepared for this catastrophe, some doomsday planners were able to find safety in underground bunkers that they built and stockpiled for just such an emergency. When Abigail Parker, or Abi was just four years old, she and her parents escaped underground with several other families and hunkered down to live in an old missile silo. Abi has grown up in this insulated, but lovingly safe environment or \u201chive\u201d with little memory of feeling the warmth of sunshine, the gentle breeze of the wind, or the grass beneath her feet. Now, after thirteen years below ground, contamination levels have been reduced and the story really begins once they resurface and begin their journey to one of the \u201csafe zones,\u201d a much larger, government controlled bunker where they can work together with other survivors to begin rebuilding the wasteland that is left. Renae does an amazing job with world-building to help readers visualize the \u201chives\u201d or underground facilities that house the survivors and the desolate landscape now bereft of animals and vegetation; the only topside inhabitants existing are the vile, cannibalistic creatures, called \u201cArvies,\u201d who\u2019ve lost their humanity and now roam the earth seeking the destruction of those around them. They crave human flesh, and one bite from an Arvy is all it takes to infect and spread the mutation. Their existence makes the story all the more horrific as Abi and her group realize that these were people with limited options for survival, who took the vaccine trusting that it would protect them from radiation poisoning, but as a result, were turned into abominable creatures who still show some capacity for thought. Although Abi and her group are forced to fight these creatures, Abi initially struggles with guilt over taking another\u2019s life, and this is one of many attributes that make her character so realistic and believable.At seventeen, Abi is perceptive, compassionate, loving, and wickedly gifted in the use of weaponry. With her trusty firearm named Hellfire, Abi proves herself over and over in helping her family and friends survive the multitude of crises they encounter. The story is well-paced and full of dangerous and suspenseful scenes that made it hard to take a reading break. Over the course of their journey I began to really care about this small group of survivors who are as close as family, extremely loyal, and always concerned for each other\u2019s well-being.Furthermore, I also became emotionally invested in the burgeoning romance between Abi and her best friend, Finn, who has grown into a handsome young man right before her very eyes. They finally reveal their mutual attraction for each other after they go topside, and I appreciated how easily they were able to express their feelings for each other and take their friendship to the next level. The description of their first kiss is memorable and is meant to solidify their commitment to each other. However, just as I suspected, their relationship will be tested after they settle in at the government run underground facility where they are surrounded by other teens, one of whom is set on vying for Finn\u2019s attention and affection. The love scenes are sweet, touching, and appropriate for young adult readers. Although I was sorry to reach the book\u2019s conclusion since the plot is nowhere near finished, the author does provide a satisfying place to pause until the next installment is released. Overall, this was a well-written story with an engaging plot and relatable characters. I\u2019m very interested in reading the next installment in this series, and I certainly recommend this book to teens and adults who enjoy post-apocalyptic fiction.

Abi, her mother, father, uncle, aunt and cousin along with a few other families all lived in the hives for thirteen years. Abi was four years old when she went into the hive. Abi and everyone else in the hive trained every day how to shoot and fight in hand to hand combat. They also worked out to keep themselves in shape. They knew that they would have to fight with others when they went topside again one day. But they didn't know that what or who they would be fighting was a big surprise to all of them.Thirteen years ago when the fallout began the government created a vaccine hoping to help the people that had nowhere to go. People that had no hive to go to that would keep them safe and alive. Everything happened so fast that they didn't have time to test the vaccines properly. The vaccine did keep the people alive if what they were changed into could be called a live. They were not dead their hearts still beat so you couldn't exactly call them zombies but they were close.Abi fell in love with one of the few guys, Finn that was her age who lived with them in the hive. Finn and Abi spent a lot of time together. They trained together, they ate together and they probably played together as children. They were only seventeen years old but they knew what it was to be in love. They both would have given their own life for the other. Abi and Finn would have also do everything and anything to help their families too. Abi and Finn both had great big hearts with a whole lot of love to go around.I loved finding and reading a whole new and different story about the apocalypses. ARV-3 is one of the best books about the apocalypses that I have ever read. It will grab a hold of you starting with the very first word and will not let you go until you have read the very last word. I even read it on my phone while I was cooking. No joke I really did. I hope the next book in the series makes its debut real soon. I want to know more about Abi, Finn, Tina, Ava and all of their parents too.

She can tell when danger is near and she can spot when something does not seem right, especially in the safe zone.Finn. Abi's best friend and blossoming love. He gives her a soft side, a side that makes her bold. This is a pushing factor to this story and it's a good one. She is able to love deeply and focus on surviving all at the same time.

And do we really care?I usually like dystopian books, but this one was just a big miss for me.I didn\u2019t like any of the characters in this book; they were all pretty stupid, short-sighted, and generally annoying. They made poor decisions, and didn\u2019t seem to think about the bigger picture \u2013 just whatever it was they wanted at that point.The storyline in this was just peppered with things that annoyed me.

I also didn\u2019t get how they were managing to sneak around when there were not only their parents around but zombies!The ending was a cliff-hanger, and it wasn\u2019t entertaining, the best thing about it was that it was the end of the book!

She\u2019s one of the few YA authors left that keep the story clean while giving the reader tons of action, emotional roller coasters and unpredictable twists. With ARV-3, she takes the tired old zombie troupe and ramps it up by using not only fast \u201czombies\u201d, but smart ones\u2026with an extra strength add on (which would be a spoiler if I mention it). This makes for potentially one of the most terrifying infected types that are out there.Now the story is a bit slow going at first, with a large cast of characters who need introduction and a situation that could have been more delicately handled than dumped in our laps, but the author attempts to give the reader a ton of background so that she can get on with the action, so it\u2019s forgivable. Once the group starts on their trek through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, we become attached to the characters and grow to love them. Then we take a hard left turn into a truly dystopian society and that\u2019s when the book really starts to get interesting!4.5 Stars!If you are looking for a post-apocalyptic book with a touch of faith, give this one a try!"}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6889983-shannon", "userReview": "I received an ARC of this book for an honest review.

My review is for the first 260 pages onlyThis is probably one of the worst books I've read (or attempted to read) this year. Right from the beginning the book was fraught with problems. Bad world building and one dimensional characters were just two of the problems. Ultimately, as my hatred for this book become more and more potent, I gave up on it.ARV-3 is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the earth or the sun shifted and then all the nuclear power plants screwed and killed everyone. Abigail Park's (Abi) family hid in an underground bunker for 13 years until the nuclear radiation started to fade away and the surface would become safe again. Unfortunately, for those who did not have a secret bunker, they would be vaccinated against radiation (theoretically, can that even happen?). This vaccination turned them into mutants called Arvies. Meanwhile, Abi's family emerges on the surface and begins their journey of finding others.Okay, so there are around 15 people living in the bunker. It's a big bunker, with many levels and even a park. Abi's dad built it way before the earth crapped out just because he was paranoid. It has all these high-class oxygen and water recycling machines. Her dad is a NASA scientist, and as far as I know, scientists at NASA don't get paid enough to be able to produce a well functioning bunker. Building a huge, comfortable bunker like that would cost a fortune, and I don't really see where or how he would ever get the money and the manpower to do so. Right when the book begins, I got blasted in the face by infodumping. Yep, we get to hear all about the earth dying and all of the characters in the bunker (who will still be boring and one-dimensional to me no matter how much time is spent describing them) and how much everyone trains and who does what in the bunker. ZZzzzZZZzz...Luckily, that part of the book passed.To then go into a barrage of insta-love and Abi's terrible personality.Abi and Finn fall deep into love (no surprise there!) and start mooning over each other 24/7. Obviously Finn is incredibly hot, nice, and strong.Abi is an unlikable character. She's one of those characters who's always bragging about how well they can fight, how well they can shoot, and generally how awesome they are. Abi actually says that she could easily take out a Navy SEAL and that she's an amazing shooter. She was so up herself, and I guess I would kind of understand if she could actually hold her own in a fight, but nope. When they leave the bunker, Abi craps herself at the sight of the Arvies even though she knew of their existence (okay, that's actually sort of understandable). When her uncle and Finn decide to go on a dangerous mission, Abi whines and brags to them about it until they allow her to go. When they do go, she freaks out completely and her uncle and Finn have to make up for her dead weight. Even worse, she ends up getting jealous when another girl talks to Finn and starts calling her a \"bitch\" for no reason.Ugh.Every other character isn't really worth talking about. There's nothing special or interesting about them.This book had so many common sense problems. If the Arvies are mindless cannibals, then why haven't they eaten each other off yet? There are approximately 15 people in the bunker and they have been there for 13 years. Abi claims that her father stocked enough preserved food to last them for many years. They never seem to run out of food in the book.So, let's assume that each character has three servings of canned/dried food every day. 15 times 3=45 cans or packages a day. There are 4745 days in 13 years. 4745 times 45=213,525 cans or packages.That food would be incredibly expensive and take up a lot of space. Given that the people in the bunker never go hungry and never mention depleting stocks of food, we can assume that they have much more. What the hell? How would someone even get that much food, and more importantly, how would they pay? The resources needed to keep 15 people alive for 13 years are huge. I find it really hard to believe that one paranoid scientist could do all of that.I mentioned before that everyone decides to leave the safety of the bunker and face the outside world. They were aware of the radiation problems are the Arvies, so why the hell did they leave? They went through a whole bunch of trouble to do so, when they could have just waited until it was safer. Given by the fact that one person dies and all the others are in danger and have nowhere to go, they weren't really well prepared anyway.There were countless moments in the book which made me scratch my head in confusion because of the poor common sense used. That was pretty much what the book was; a bunch of stupid characters and stupid decisions that eventually led to stupid outcomes. When Abi became jealous and petty, I gave up altogether. I would not recommend this book to anyone. However, I can see this book being liked by some people, due to some of the post-apocalyptic and survivalist elements. But stay away from this book if insta-love, stupidity, and stuck up characters bother you.An ARC was provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": " CCAM&GZM", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5879896-ccam-gzm", "userReview": "Even if the cover design could make you to think at whatever horror story you have in mind, I say to you from the beginning that this novel is part of a Young Adult series. I know this information may be superfluous for those who have read the description, but as books pertaining to this genre have more suggestive covers for young people (a bit too easy in my opinion) I wanted to mention this. It is a book for teenagers and I can go a bit further and say that is addressed mainly to girls. Why so? Before you jump with a wrong conclusion and accuse me of being sexist or with too masculine impulses, note that there are plenty of books or movies that I could name among my favorites that have as main character a woman. But in this novel, the feelings, thoughts and actions of the main character are a little too feminine adolescent, and I don\u2019t think that the male readers, even if they are teenagers, will resonate and will recognize themselves much in the central character of this book. But I think it would not be bad for them to read the book and understand (could ever boys understand?) how a girl feels and lives the first love. This is not a criticism, just an observation. Maybe it's just me, maybe ... So, girls ... let\u2019s start! ARV \u2013 3 is an apocalyptic or, to be more precise, a post apocalyptic novel, but also with some dystopian tendencies. I hope you do not confuse the terms and if we are at the explanations time, apocalyptic concerns a world devastated like in the zombie stories and dystopian society refers to a coercive and dictatorial society (the novel \"1984\" by George Orwell is the best example) which is the opposite of the utopian one. Despite the premises and the set in which the novel operates, the story is a love one. There is not a Romeo and Juliet story, families are not the problem and the obstacle to their happiness, but the legacy that the old society had left them. It\u2019s a poisoned legacy that has devastated the Earth's surface, an unforgiving and full of dangers one. It is a story about camaraderie, self-sacrifice, about the love for your dear ones, about courage and audacity. But is also a sensible tale, about the feelings and the beauty of first love. A fine and pure love, a young love full of hope that seeks a chance and a purpose in a broken world. A novel in which the sensibility is intertwined with violence, the gun metal coldness stand next to the lover\u2019s embrace fire, and both the joy and despair claim the right to be the key words. A journey of a group of survivors who may be best described by simply saying: \"Leap out from the frying pan into the fire\". A fray that, albeit for the moment seemed taken only against the monsters that inhabited the new world, finds new enemies right in the midst of survivors. And so, the transition from the apocalyptic to dystopian does not seem so difficult. The denouement? You must have a little patience. You'll find it in the next volume or volumes. ARV-3 is a novel that starts without much preparation and you will be captivated by the moments of tensions and action even if the story is not filled with terrifying descriptions or sprinkled with grotesque images that are characteristic to apocalyptic genre. A book that brings sensitivity, but also force through the fight scenes that are not few. The author will enjoy you with her concise (in a good way), very visual and engaging style that will go directly to your heart. There will be something for everybody. Even if I said that the girls will be (or are) the target audience, I recommend the book also to the boys. There will be no time lost, and as I mentioned, maybe they will learn something about how the girls are and act.GZM http://mythicalbooks.blogspot.ro/2014..."}, {"userName": "Mandy (I Read Indie) Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3261049-mandy-i-read-indie-anderson", "userReview": "The world around us was desolate and bereft of life.

This has got to be one of my favourite introductions to a book, ever. I loved the prelude to ARV-3, it makes this story feel even more real with the whole ending of the world in 2012. While the world didn't end in 2012, the effects of the solar flare are real, and we get to see how catastrophic it was on the earth, the prelude is told by Abigail Park I had goosebumps from finishing it..Abi and Fin, part of the small group of survivors that hid in a shelter, learning survival skills and growing up till it was safe to go topside. Thirteen years after the effects of the radiation had worn off they make the choice to venture up and make the perilous journey to a bigger, better, safe haven.The first day going topside is hard on everyone, and with attacking Arvies it's hard for them to make their way to a safe zone, not once can they let their guard down and relax, each step ahead, each stop they plan to make must be thought out and considered wisely.ARV-3 has a way of drawing you into this world, and getting completely sucked into it, I was a bag of nerves as they began their journey, not knowing if they would make it to the destination. The desolation of the Earth is told with such stark detail that it was easy to imagine how bad it was, and how much destruction had been caused. The Arvies are not creatures that I would want to meet anywhere, even in daylight, and the description of them sounds scary enough.Throughout ARV-3 there were characters that I liked, and some I just didn't, but I will leave that judgement to you. One person who I did instantly like was Tina, I thought she was a good friend and roommate for Abi, and helps her immensely in the settling in period. There were moments I wanted to slap Fin for his behaviour towards others, yes I know he has grown up in a very sheltered environment but he seriously couldn't have been that naive. That being said though, Abi should have given him a chance to explain or at least explain to him what her issues where.The last few chapters of ARV-3 were beyond nerve wracking, I was once again a nervous wreck, worrying over what would happen to characters, who would survive and who wouldn't. Even though things went the way I wanted them to go I could not relax until they were on the way out.I enjoyed following this group of people as they try to make it in this new world for themselves, and while I did enjoy the story as a whole, there were one or two things that bugged me. One of the main things I disliked was although it was a tough journey, I felt like they got off too easy. They were rescued too easily and too soon and although the rescue doesn't go as planned, and things do happen which I won't elaborate on, I still felt it was too easy, that they didn't really get chance to get a full experience of this new Earth, or maybe I just wanted them to suffer a bit more.Overall I enjoyed ARV-3 and I like how Cameo has seamlessly gone from one genre to another without any major issues. Reading ARV-3 feels like it's a perfect genre for Cameo and I do look forward to reading what happens net for these characters."}, {"userName": "Kendall {Book Crazy}", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11385469-kendall-book-crazy", "userReview": "I had been desperate to read this book! I'm a huge fan of dystopian, apocalyptic books, so I knew that I was going to love this one! And love it I did! This book was amazing! It was really unique as well! I haven't read anything quite like it! The plot of this book was insane! There was so much going on and there was never a dull moment that would ever make you want to put the book down! Like, ever! I loved that there was also plenty of background in this book about what made the world come to an end and how people survived! The aspect of the mutants was also pretty original, as they were kind of like zombies, but they weren't because the mutants were still human in a way! And also, their bites could turn you and they had to survive by eating human flesh! The mutants were a fresh idea and a new take on a dystopian, apocalyptic book! The plot also went in a different direction to what I was expecting, but I really, really enjoyed it! I was expecting the plot to go in a way of the characters trying to survive in the outside world with the mutants, and they did for some of the book, but then a lot of the plot was based in a compound of sort, which, if I'm honest, I was kinda expecting to happen in the next book lol! I did enjoy where the overall plot went though and I did think that this book was a standalone to start with, so it would have been perfect if it had been! I'm so happy it's a series though! The characters were amazing! Abigail was the main character and this book was written from her point of view! I loved Abi! There were some times in this book where I thought she maybe overreacted a little and she just had to listen, but apart from that, she was a genuine person who was having to adjust to living in a dangerous world! Abi was also such a such a fighter! She was always willing to risk her own life in order to save someone else's and that's something I strongly admired about her! I hope she stays like this in the next book! She was also acted just like a normal girl, but I loved that she had a bit of a rebelious streak to her too! She was willing to go to all lengths to find out the truth, which I loved! Finn was the love interest of Abi and I have to admit that I wasn't sure if there was going to be a romance in this book, but I'm so happy there was! Finn was such a sweetheart! He was there for Abi from page one and I loved how protective he was of her as well! Plus, he was so hot! My heart was in my mouth for Finn at the end of this book! I had no idea what was going to happen to him! The secondary characters in this book also added so much to the plot! I can't wait to see them develop in the next book! As I said, I thought that this book was a standalone when I first heard about it, but I'm really happy to discover that it's actually the beginning of a series! I cannot wait to read the next book in this series and see what's going to happen next! Plus, the ending of this book left it at a great place, but I did think it was slightly rushed! The cover for this book is absolutely perfect! It represents what happened in the book brilliantly as well! I love it!

This book was not at all what I expected and I mean that in the best possible way. I went into this book thinking I knew what would happen, but I had no idea what I was in for. This book was so full of excitement I has a hard time putting it down and I was very shocked when it was over, I was so invested and I was left hanging by the way, I just could not believe my journey in this world had come to an end, lets just say I needed a few minutes to recover. I really liked the bond and sense of family that the members of Abi's original hive had, and it was very interesting to see how after 13 years around the same group of people and shut off form the world adjusted to a much larger space and group of people. That also brings me to say that I am very suspicious of \"the white city\" and hope that as a family Abi's hive will figure out what the heck is going on there. I was very blind sided by a certain political figure, I thought he was a good guy, but apparently I was very very wrong.Cameo Renae created a very interesting post-Apocalyptic world and the idea behind the Arvies (which you need to read about to realise just hoe genius this is) was so cool and fresh in a world filled with zombie Apocalypse stories.\"They were akin to zombies, except the Arvies hadn't died. They still had a heartbeat, and blood flowing through their veins. They were still very much alive.\"I am still thinking about them I feel bad, yet they are trying to extinguish the human race, I think that it is very sneaky and smart giving the reader a soft spot for the enemy. Not only did she create a great and terrible world she also created great and terrible characters, I was angry with some, some made me smile, and on more than one occasion I was made to cry. Abi was a great main character she was strong willed, loyal, and had great wit, but she did tick me off with her quick and awful decision with Finn, but thank goodness she came to her senses. Finn wow what do I say....can I please have one???, he was strong, brave, funny and if I'm correct by the image in my head he is insanely HOT!There were so many other great characters on both the side of good and evil and even the unknown side.

That about sums it up. This my first taste of Cameo Renae\u2019s writing and she does not disappoint! It has it all from first love, zombies-like creatures, heart-thudding action, all wrapped up in a page turner package.It\u2019s the end of days.

Abigail is a teenager who has been in an underground bunker most of her life, it is the only home she has really known. She is, for someone so young, an excellent shot. Finn is Abi's best friend and a few years older than her. When Abigail, her family and friends entered the bunker they knew that they would only be able to leave it after ten years, possibly more. This is how long the government decided it would take for the environment topside to recover from the disaster which sent them into the bunker in the first place.Thirteen long years pass and the members of the hive are ready to take their first steps outside. But what they encounter when they do leave shocks them all to the core. Abigail's marksmanship becomes extremely important, on more than one occasion, and helps not only her bunker family, but others they meet along the way.The journey which everyone undertakes is nothing they could have prepared themselves for. What they find along the way, and the trouble they have trying to reach a safe destination, leads them to be emotionally and physically challenged.Can this small group of survivors find safety? Will they make it through the new world they find outside? And if they do reach safety, will that turn into something else entirely?The writing is good, the pace of the story kept my interest all the way through, and the ending leaves it open for more to follow.All in all a great story which brings something new to the zombie/post apocalyptic genre in my opinion.

Instead of emerging to find that the world is ready to be rebuilt, they find it's still claimed, by people who were mutated by the false assurances of a vaccine distributed by a government who needed to placate the people until they could hide. For some reason I have yet to fathom, they decide to take their chances moving to the \"safe zone\" ran by the same government that created the mutants, or \"arvies\". I'm not sure yet if this is a post apocalyptic book, a horror book, or a straight up dystopian with some mutant sidelines. What I do know is that it is entertaining and fast paced and gave me something interesting to read while holed up against the cold.

She spent most of her life in an underground bunker after her family and a few others escaped the nuclear disaster that took out most of the population. She trained and became an expert marksman.
