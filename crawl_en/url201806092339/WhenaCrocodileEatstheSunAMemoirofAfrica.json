The story is comprehensive in that it touches on all the aspects, although not in tedious details, defining Africa as it is today and how it came about. He includes a lot of details of various aspects of the madness happening in Zimbabwe which he derived from various articles he wrote for different media outlets. But then he includes his family's personal history to remain true to the memoir-format of the book. He also draws a comparison to the holocaust events of what is happening to whites in Zimbabwe. I was constantly aware that the events were treated as journalistic exercises. However, it is a sad report on how quickly a country turned from a food basket to a dust bowl when things went wrong.\"When I am back in New York, Africa immediately seems fantastical - a wildly plumaged bird, as exotic as it is nlikely.\"\"Most of us struggle in life to maintain the illusion of control, but in Africa that illusion is almost impossible to maintain. I always have the sense there that there is no equilibrium, that everything perpetually teeters on the brink of some dramatic change, that society constantly stands poised in some spasm, some tsunami in which you can do nothing but hope to bob up to the surface and not be sucked out into a dark and hungry sea. The origin of my permanent sense of unease, my general foreboding, is probably the fact that I have lived through just such change, such as sudden and violent upending of value systems.\"Different readers obviously focus on different aspect of the story. There are many reviews on Goodreads, providing other insights into the story. I don't want to add yet another comment on the actual content of the book, but would rather prefer to look at the underlying message in the book about human rights and how selectively it is applied to different situations in the world. Africa is a place where calculated acts of cultural and racial genocide, combined with xenophobia, take on totally different colors than the officially defined. Let's summarize the actual, official definition of human rights first and then look at the story from different perspectives:HUMAN RIGHTSIn the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Preamble, the following statements are made: (Source: United Nations Department of Public Information, NY) Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and ppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations,Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the\tgreatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,...READ MORE..Who really has the teeth to address this issue? Not the UN, where Russia and China sanction any actions against their 'friends'. The two countries whose human rights records stink up the universe, have the veto right on it.FROM A COMMUNIST PERSPECTIVEComparing the events in Zimbabe, actually everywhere in Africa, where landowners of different colors have been expropriated in different ways(mostly violent murders), to the events in all countries where Communism took over - the absolutely shocking horror and atrocities used in executing the decision, the evidence of similar patrons is spread all over the place. In the case of Zimbabwe, and South Africa as well, although more subtle, the modus operandi is more Maoistic than Stalanistic with all the cruelties included of Mao's believes and conduct. But Wole Soyinka, the Nobel prize-winning Nigerian writer, (P.266) \"compares the Zimbabwean land-reform program with Stalin's land collectivization in Soviet Russia, designed to get rid of the kulaks, the pre-revolutionary commercial farmers whom he saw as a political threat.\" A much more accurate comparison, in my opinion, can be drawn with M\u00e1o's land reform in which landgrabbers were instructed to kill and take whatever they wanted. It is very well illustrated in the book '\n\nWild Swans - three daughters of China'\n\n by Jung Chang. I can add, for shock value, the photos of the genocidal slaughtering, because that is what it is, of the white farmers and their families in both countries, but the reader can find thousands of it on the internet. There are hundreds of organizations trying to create awareness and attract attention to these senseless, barbaric murders. But the world is officially turning a blind eye. Unofficially little more is done. For instance, white refugees are not handled the same way as other refugee under international law. As soon as a white person apply for refugee status, an uproar is stage and the sympathy is shifted to the offended black regime who claim to be victims of prejudice as well as colonization and hidden racist agendas. They are quick to add that they cannot be held responsible for some citizens who want to take revenge. And so some people back down. But countries such as China are not interested in what happens inside the walls of the house being plundered for their hungry economy. They simply subsidize Zimbabwe's government expenses and keep Mugabe in power for their own ends. And this way many eyes from countries that need Africa's wealth turn many blind eyes. After all, who wants to be accused of being fascist thugs?FROM A WORLD PERSPECTIVEWith just about the entire world dependent on Africa's wealth of resources, the outcome of Africa's history is determined by corporations and political big wigs with their hands in the cookie jars. In order of importance, Human Rights are so irrelevant, it is considered to be like a small asthmatic fish dying on dry land, no matter how noble the intentions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have been. There are much bigger fish to catch in this vast ocean of African wealth which demands much more attention and promises much more profits.FROM AN AFRICAN PERSPECTIVEWhat started out as a noble idea of liberating Africa from thousands of years of oppression, ended up in a cesspool of a carefully selected cleptrocratic, nepotistic group of despots raping the continent's wealth and keeping themselves in power with barbaric clamp-downs on the inhabitants. For every white person being murdered, another five Africans are killed by their own governments for opposing these mafiosos in power. I found the Goodwin book a true version of events - accurate, insightful, and well executed. Being a memoir, it discusses a family's situation in which their basic human rights have been severely compromised. The hardships they had to face, emotionally as well as physically, are heart-wrenching. Godwin also touches on colonialism as a contributing factor to the current violence on whites: P. 153: \"It is sometimes said that the worst thing to happen to Africa was the arrival of the white man. And the second worst was his departure. Colonialism lasted just long enough to destroy much of Africa's indigenous cultures and traditions, but not long enough to leave behind a durable replacement.\"P. 155:\"When the first Europeans arrive in Africa, they bring their territorial imperative with them. And once the dust settles from the \"Scramble for Africa\", the continent finds itself sliced up into bizarre and arbitrary shapes. Kilimanjaro, for instance, is given by Queen Victoria as a birthday present to her cousin, the Kaiser, because she has two snow-capped African peaks, and he has none. Many of these new states lump together ancient antagonists, cut across cultural and economic hinterlands. Europeans take Africa by the scruff of its neck and shake the bejesus into it, knocking it clear of its cultural fulcrum by doing good things and bad on so many frons: religion, trade, infrastructure, health. Societies that are built on the mathematical fundamentals of women giving birth to twelve in order to bring two or three to maturity suddenly find themselves with five, seven, nine children and all the attendant cultural chaos. Europeans entice them to want stuff - soap, clothes, bicycles, radios, stoves; turn then into impoverished consumers; co-opt their chiefs, tax them and compel them to leave home, to labour for wages.\"Human rights and equality for all was one of the major ideals of Nelson Mandela. But his love for people became the main reason why he was shunted onto a sideline by the members of his party who craved a ride on the gravy train and pushed everything and anyone out of the way that apposed their greed. Modern Africa was never a haven for human rights, although it was suppose to be. If it was, there would not have been so many millions of Africans fleeing their own countries to particularly Europe and America as well as South Africa! So much so, that it is currently creating huge challenges for the host countries. The black-on-black violence is much worse in scope and numbers as well compared to the white genocide.So if you are interested in basic Human Rights and what it really should mean, you can read this book. If you want to read more about the African story, this is one true version of the events. And after you have read it, you will have to decided where you stand on the Human Rights issue, how selectively you are in your own application of it.\u00a0 Should it only apply to groups you have sanctioned? But, just as a human-interest story, This book is a beautiful book written in eloquent prose. I am not so impressed with the choice of title though. It might allow an exotic touch to the story, it is an eye-catcher, but for me, does not apply really to the situation. The reason being that these atrocities are happening on a daily basis and have been doing so for centuries. It is not a once-off occurrence. Five stars for the guts it took to write this detailed version of an African love story gone wrong. In my opinion, it is the basic human right of everyone to tell his/her story. It is the only way a complete version of history can be recorded. It is another way of demonstrating greed in all its different disguises. This book made a valuable contribution. The most important message, to me personally, in this book, lies in the proof it provides that throughout human history, cruelty has not been limited to one creed or color. There simply are no saints in the saga of human existence.I wanted to read this book for months now. It was lying here waiting. I was expecting it to be a good counter-balance for \"African Laughter: Four Visits to Zimbabwe by Doris Lessing. It was. What Lessing failed to acknowledge (was it deliberate omission perhaps of the horrendous atrocities?) in her book as a result of the revolt, fueled by communism (which she promoted in Zimbabwe in her earlier involvement in the country's politics), Godwin has added in clinical detail. It was needed."}, {"userName": "Spudsie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1296189-spudsie", "userReview": "This book will haunt you. It haunts me. I was in a hotel room in Chicago trying to get ready for an early morning conference session. I was watching \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on MSNBC when Peter Godwin came on. I was not familiar with him, but listening to him talk about Zimbabwe intrigued me. Despite purloining 8 million vendor pens at the vendor hall the previous day, I could not quickly locate a pen and paper to write down the title of his book. Thanks goodness for technology! I grabbed my Blackberry and sent myself an e-mail with the book title and author\u2019s name. Once home I ordered the book and sat it on my \u201cto read\u201d pile for about a month.I started reading \u201cCrocodile\u201d mid week. I read a few pages and had to put it down. I just didn\u2019t have the time to keep reading. Friday afternoon I picked it up again-- and promptly cancelled my plans for the evening. I could not bear to stop reading.

I felt as though he pulled me into his life.His story made me laugh at times, say \u201caha!\u201d at times, but mainly it made me weep.Some books make me tear-up\u2014tears form in the corners of my eyes and usually fall down my face at some point, but it\u2019s just a tear or two.Some books make me cry\u2014mutiple tears falling simultaneously while my nose runs to the point I have to either put the book down and get a tissue, or (and please don\u2019t tell anyone I do this!!) keep reading the book and use my sleeve. Very few books make we weep\u2014cry to the point I have no choice but to set the book aside, find a box of tissues, and weep nearly uncontrollably.This book made we weep. Multiple times. I wept for the people of Zimbabwe and their struggles. I wept for the inhumanity of the leaders and \u201cwovits.\u201d I wept for the personal losses suffered by the Godwins. Sometimes I wept because I was simply overwhelmed by all of it.Though Godwin writes this book in a fairly detached manner, it evoked a very strong emotional reaction in me.

He brilliantly shares his experience living under Robert Mugabe, who has been the country's dicator since the 1970's. My problem, however, is how he portrays his parents, and their near-saintliness. They are/were clearly warm people with an impressive degree of moral courage. But he never addresses the fact that Zimbabwe -- formerly Rhodesia, was a European colony before Mugabe, and suffered accordingly under white rule. He never seems to question why there was so much opposition to the white settlers, who had the best farmland, and (his own parents included), black servants. While I thouroughly enjoyed Godwin's gorgeous writing, I was frequently frustrated with his reluctance to address the oppression of the blacks, which continues to haunt the country.Godwin is the better writer, but I preferred Fuller's book. Her Zimbabwe is just as frightening, and beautiful. But she never withdraws judgement throughout her book. Her approach lends greater credibility.Please note: I'm not arguing that Mugabe's monstrous behavior towards any of his subjects is justifiable.

This one focuses upon his father's life in Zimbabwe, and how he ended up there. I believe I made the wrong choice. It took me a very long time to care for the family. The first third focuses upon political turmoil and history of Rhodesia and how it became Zimbabwe. Every chapter is dated. The first being July 1996 and the last February 2004. The author grew up in Rhodesia. It is evident that he feels himself to be both \"African\" as well as an outsider. When he writes the book he is living in NYC and is a well paid and recognized journalist writing for magazines such as National Geographic. The book follows the author's visits to his homeland and specifically his elderly parents. His mother is a doctor and his father a farmer. It follows the events that were occurring in Zimbabwe on the given dates. The country's and the family's downward spiral are one and the same. It is devastating to watch what Robert Mugabe has done to this country. By the end I was in tears. When I read a book about the political events of a country I want to know how these events play out in people's lives. This is exactly what you are given in this book.I want to feel empathy for the people. By the end I certainly did, but it took a good 100 pages for this to begin.There is little or no humor in the book. I found it extremely depressing. OK, this is the truth of what Mugabe has done to this land, but more family events that were amusing could have been thrown in. In addition, I felt that the author added gruesome details scarcely relevant to the story. He need not have shown us, step by horrible step, how Jews met their death at Treblinka. Neither did I find the writing particularly outstanding, just ordinary.Ironically, what has united the blacks and whites in Zimbabwe is a shared hatred of Mugabe..... Along with this book one could read Alexandra Fuller's Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness and Don't Let's Go To The Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood. These two are less politically explicit and cover events further back in time. If you are interested more in Mugabe's rule, choose \"When a Crocodile Eats the Sun\" instead. The other two have a completely different tone. I could not help but smile as I read them.

Godwin served briefly in the Rhodesian security forces before going off to Cambridge and returning to southern Africa first as a barrister and then as a journalist. He writes about how the optimism of the first decade of post-independence soured in the 1990s as the Mugabe regime degenerated into a violent kleptocracy and HIV ravaged the population, reducing African life expectancy in Zimbabwe from 57 in 1980 to 34 by the beginning of the 21st century.Godwin discovers there as his much-admired father slips into old age and a final illness that George Godwin, safari-suited British engineer, was by birth a Polish Jew named Kasimir Goldfarb, a veteran of the wartime Free Polish forces, a man whose family died at Treblinka. The book counterpoints Godwin's discovery of his father's childhood with the destruction of white life in Zimbabwe, with the Mugabe dictatorship's chaotic and self-destructive program of inciting mobs to seize and partition white-owned farms. To be white in Zimbabwe in 2003, Godwin sees, is like being Jewish in Poland after the German occupation--- a life lived on suffrance. Godwin writes about the end of a world--- not just white Rhodesia, but of the hopes raised at independence. \"When a Crocodile Eats the Sun\" ends with Godwin overseeing his late father's cremation, realising that he's an African no longer welcome in Africa. This is an account I'll keep in my own memory for a long time--- tragic, spare, thoughtful, unutterably sad. Read it.

He glosses over fighting on the wrong side of Zimbabwe's war for independence and never properly questions his privileged upbringing and the British status quo. Most of the examples he employs to gain our sympathy involve white farmers loosing their land and family photographs; the stories that include native Africans often end with them stealing something or running away. For someone who attempts to represent Africa to a western audience, this seems rather bad form.Still, Godwin does a good job of chronicling Zimbabwe's demise under the increasingly autocratic rule of Robert Mugabe and the manifold challenges that everyday Zimbabweans face to survive. Godwin even goes into detail about the repression and violence that Mugabe's regime uses to stay in power, but he's subtle -- too subtle -- about his criticism of it. Even his stories about the opposition usually include the appearances of white Zimbaweans. 'When a Crocodile East the Sun' is worth reading for the inside view it offers us of a nation's collapse, but not for the author's politics."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19640-kristen", "userReview": "Godwin's \"When a Crocodile Eats the Sun\" is not only compelling and well-written, but more timely than ever. A memoir of his adult life after having left Zimbabwe, the place of his birth (he is a journalist for National Geographic and a slew of other top-notch publications), Godwin painfully portrays the experience of white Africans in Zimbabwe, and his own family's history in their journey to Africa. It gives an insider's view of Mugabe's reign of terror, and the utter chaos that has enveloped the country.Perhaps the most compelling part of the story is that of his parents, elderly in the late 90s and early 2000s. Anyone who has cared for an aging loved one, and who feels the guilt of the child or grandchild who is no longer at home to care for them, is struck by this emotional theme in the story. Add to this feeling the fact that his aging parents are in a conflict torn country with few resources, wild inflation, and rampant crime and intimidation, and you get a sense of the emotional and moral dilemma Godwin goes through. His parents are rooted in their home country and won't leave, but their children cannot viably stay; indeed, one of Godwin's siblings is a casualty of random violence during the Civil War. Godwin and his remaining sister act as international voices on the crisis, she on the radio, he in print. This is a heartbreaking and riveting book, which can be paired daily with the newspaper to show how so little has changed in Zimbabwe (the book ends in 2004), and how Mugabe's reign of terror last until this day."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie", "userReview": "In the early nineties I spent some time in Zimbabwe, and I have always wanted to go back.

This memoir about the author's home in Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwae. The majority of the story takes place during the 1990's and 2000's during Robert Mugabe's presidency - which still continues today. Political fraud, beatings, slavery, killings, etc. were rampant, and we see how much damage was done to a once-thriving economy. Many white Africans lived on commercial farmland that was taken over by \"war vets\" (called wovits). As Mugabe rose to power, violence and thievery became the norm. Godwin's parents chose to stay in their adopted homeland and the story was told through a series of his visits back to visit them. Not only does Crocodile Eats the Sun provide the reader with a starting off point to begin to understand Zimbabwae's tumultuous past, but we also learn about the ex-pats who chose to live and work in parts of Africa - mostly war veterans after WWII.The writing was so dramatically beautiful in many parts. For example:\"In Africa, you do not view death from the auditorium of life, as a spectator, but from the edge of the stage, waiting only for your cue. You feel perishable, temporary, transient. You feel mortal. Maybe that is why you seem to live more vividly in Africa. The drama of life there is amplified by its constant proximity to death. That's what infuses it with tension. It is the essence of its tragedy too. People love harder there. Love is the way that life forgets that it is terminal. Love is life's alibi in the face of death.\"Also, \"Most of us struggle in life to maintain the illusion of control, but in Africa that illusion is almost impossible to maintain. I always have the sense there that there is no equilibrium, that everything perpetually teeters on the brink of some dramatic change, that society constantly stands poised for some spasm, some tsunami in which you can do nothing but hope to bob up to the surface and not be sucked out into a dark and hungry sea.\"Beautiful writing - such tragedy, but the author was able to keep me smiling through the tears with comical anecdotes.

The answer is \u201cplenty\u201d. This one is focuses on the period between 1996 and 2004 when Robert Mugabe is encouraging the \u201cwovits\u201d (supposedly vets of the civil war but mostly thugs and opportunists) to confiscate land from white settlers. Mugabe seems to want to get rid of whites in Zimbabwe and to make what was a country genuinely successful at developing a multi-racial society into an all black country; ruining the country's economy in the process. Production is down, the economy is shrinking, inflation is off the wall. Not only whites but middle class blacks are immigrating in droves.Godwin, a journalist, has lived in the UK and the US for years but loves his country and has made a specialty of getting jobs reporting from there. His parents remained there as did his sister, a TV journalist. What's compelling about this memoir, though, is the author's skill at simultaneously reporting on the beauty and promise and on the horrible political present of a part of the world most of us know little about and think of only as a place of abject poverty and ugliness. Godwin's love of Zimbabwe and its people, black and white, is infectious. But he's very talented also at weaving Zimbabwe's story in with that his own family. His older sister, killed by terrorists whose grave is vandalized. His physician mother who\u2019s given and given again to the people of Zimbabwe. His younger sister whose journalism gets her banned to North London where she broadcasts back to Zimbabwe. Godwin learns during the time frame of the book that his tight-lipped British father is actually a Polish Jew and holocaust survivor trapped in Britain in 1939 where he went on a course to learn English. His mother and sister ended their lives in Treblinka. His father was never allowed to learn Poland. Godwin\u2019s telling of his father's story would seem totally irrelevant to present day Africa, as would Goodwin\u2019s own experience of volunteering his time in the wake of 9/11 (his own neighborhood), but that's the beauty of a good memoirist who can make anything that happens to him \"relevant\u201d. In the end he feel compelled to compare his own need to leave Africa with his father\u2019s to leave Poland: \u201cLike Poland was to him, Africa is for me: a place in which I can never truly belong, a dangerous place that will, if I allow it to, reach into my life and hurt my family. A white in Africa is like a Jew anywhere\u2014on sufferance, watching wearily, waiting for the next great tidal swell of hostility.\u201dI can\u2019t recommend this book enough."}, {"userName": "Dixie Diamond", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/610795-dixie-diamond", "userReview": "This was both very interesting and rather tiresome.It's a memoir, not a history book, so it's to be expected that it emphasizes the writer's perspective and feelings more than the facts of what was going on. Godwin's writing style is sensitive but mercifully not prone to histrionics.Nevertheless--and I realize the irony of this being written by a white American--it is hard to feel too sympathetic towards white Zimbabwean colonists and what sounds like an insular, patronizing, big-fish-in-a-small-pond culture of entitlement. The white farmers we meet in the book all seem to have large landholdings, pools, maids, gardeners, legions of dependent farm workers, and spiny sisal hedges to serve as \" . . . barrier[s:] against the huddled masses outside, reinforcing it until they have judged it impregnable . . .\" Godwin's parents sound like out-of-touch small-town aristocracy; his mother still refers to Ethiopians as \"Abyssinians\" and has never seen a pull-tab Coke can. Whites are routinely offered kindnesses above-and-beyond by poorer blacks, and Godwin acknowledges these but never convincingly grasps them as the product of colonialism.Everything I can find claims that whites were about 1% of the population but owned 70% of the land. And they didn't see a revolt coming? Seriously?Godwin also discovers partway into the book that his father was actually a Polish Jew who lost his mother and sister to the Nazis, instead of a Briton, and, although he doesn't say so explicitly, seems anxious to parallel this sad family history with the next generation's expulsion from Zimbabwe. It doesn't quite work, though, since Jews in Europe weren't a tiny, recently-arrived, ruling caste with a death grip on the national economy."}, {"userName": "Greer Noble", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12431637-greer-noble", "userReview": "Gives one a very good idea of how traumatic and depressing it was for Peter's family and families like Peter's.

There's no effective way to argue that statement. But is *why* is it a mess? Can it effectively heal? What does what happened in Zimbabwe mean for the rest of Africa?Peter Godwin was born in Rhodesia - what became Zimbabwe. His family remained in-country after Mugabe came to power, and while Godwin himself moved to America and traveled the world as a journalist, he repeatedly came back to care for his parents and witness the events overtaking his home. Along the way, he learns the true story of his father's background and begins to understand why his parents refuse to leave, even as the world falls down around them.Godwin is very effective in his descriptions of what happened to white farmers and the middle class black Africans under Mugabe. It is horrifying. From the attacks of \"wovits\" and murders of farmers, to a haunting description of an attack and rape of a young girl attempting to cross the South African border - an attack which is an example rather than the exception, to the story of Meryl Harrison and her efforts at rescuing the animals of war, at no time does Godwin spare the details. And yet, he is never able to break away from his love and longing for Africa, and for Zimbabwe. Godwin does not go into the pre-Mugabe history of Zimbabwe, other than a few facts needed to explain how the white settlers arrived in the country and the tribal relations present at that time. If one is looking for a complete history, this book is not the vehicle for that. It is, however, a riveting account of what Godwin witnessed. Godwin's writing is masterful, the emotions in the narrative are raw, even while he doesn't explicitly state what he was feeling. In one scene near the end of the book, you can feel the turmoil running through Godwin as he witnesses one of the street hawkers near his house collapse into an epileptic seizure. Godwin feels driven to help the man, and yet is terrified of being bitten in a country where HIV is rampant. Godwin also recognizes that the street hawker might be one of the people who has terrorized his parents in their home, stealing their car and making it impossible for his parents to leave after dark.In the end, Godwin helps the man.Other vignettes show both the hope and despair of living under Mugabe: his mother, bleeding profusely after a hip operation, refuses a necessary blood transfusion. When Godwin desperately asks a nurse what she would do, the nurse shakes her head and admits she would not have a transfusion for any reason.When Godwin's father is shopping for bread and doesn't have enough money to pay for his purchases, the shopkeeper wraps them up anyway because a woman behind them in line - an African woman - has paid for him. And Godwin's parents are first cared for by the servants they have known and supported for over twenty years, and then betrayed by them. When a Crocodile Eats the Sun isn't a beautiful story, nor is it complete. But it accomplishes what it set out to do, which is to bear witness to Zimbabwe under Mugabe. It is uncomfortable reading, not just for what it is relating, but because it makes clear how thin the line is between civilization and savagery; and how even good people can be swept up in the madness and descent -swept up into unspeakable actions."}, {"userName": "Scot", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/663291-scot", "userReview": "This memoir by Peter Goodwin is exquisitely written; troubling in what it conveys about societal breakdowns, racism, and ethnic cleansing; inspiring in what it suggests about some individual acts of perseverance and charity; and informative about Africa\u2014particularly Zimbabwe in the Mugabe years.While the larger theme tells us the story of Rhodesia becoming Zimbabwe, and how Zimbabwe evolves (or devolves, depending upon one\u2019s perspective), the immediacy and power of the work comes from the way the author takes us on his journey of self-discovery about his own father, a taciturn man certainly not given to reminiscing about his past. Goodwin has a gift for language, but also for making the reader feel he is privy to startling realizations and emotional insights just as they hit the author. This intimacy becomes well developed, and even though their world is far different from mine, I came to feel like an extended member of the Goodwin family, finding joy in their private signals of elephant ears, appreciation for each of their individual quirks, gifts, and social contributions.So much so, that when while halfway through the book I mentioned to a black African friend the specific atrocities of Mugabe I was just learning about, I was a bit startled when he responded with a rather deadpan defense of Mugabe as a challenge needed against the great evil of white colonialism. I felt a racial divide begin to arise between us\u2014something I didn\u2019t intend to trigger, and perhaps a bit thoughtlessly, hadn\u2019t foreseen. Not being an African myself, I can\u2019t begin to fathom how one negotiates the contradictions of historical injustice on one side and the destruction of a viable economy by totalitarianism fueled by a cry for racial vengeance on the other.Keeping aware that Goodwin has been shaped by his own experience, and is going to give his version of his family\u2019s praiseworthy contributions to their vision of a possible multiracial Zimbabwe, one can nevertheless begin to appreciate these complexities of colonialism\u2019s legacy much better by reading this memoir. The fact that the book begins and ends with the same passages is artistic\u2014it was a bit confusing at the start but then it resonated deeply at the finish. The author\u2019s international identity might be seen as an aspect of globalization from a 21st century perspective, but as the memoir skillfully reveals, as a man without a country he is truly his father\u2019s son."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary", "userReview": "Using his own experiences and that of his own family to illustrate the tragedy of how the ego of a vile old man and the poison of revolutionary totalitarian politics (wherever it exists in the world) has destroyed a nation once known as the bread basket of Africa.The author covers the reign of terror begun by Robert Mugabe and his Stalinist ZANU PF since he lost a crucial referendum in 2000 and began to lose support to the social-democratic Movement for Democratic Change.A shocking expose not only of the brutal attacks and murders of White farmers but also the terror and politicide perpetrated by Mugabe's Brown Shirts (the incorrectly named War Veterans)against Zimbabwe's masses.One of Mugabe's top Cabinet ministers, Didymus Mutasa responded to reports of mass famine in Zimbabwe by In 2002, he stating that it would be a good thing if the population were halved: \"We would be better off with only six million people, with our own people who supported the liberation struggle. We don't want all these extra people.\"Not long after that South Africa's then Minister of Intelligence Stalinist hardliner Ronnie Kasrils appeared together in a press conference with Mutasa in South Africa where Kasrils referred to Mugabe's regime as 'our allies' and said that 'South Africa and Zimbabwe have a common world view and will march forward together step by step\".Much of South Africa's wealthy ruling party elite greatly support and admire Mugabe's ZANUPF regime as do ultra-left radicals around the world, as Zimbabwe's people are massacred and subjected to famine by this regime.Grizzly evidence of the destruction and murder visited by the ZANU PF militia on Zimbabwe's people and animal life too.Also interesting is the revelation that the authors father was not British as he thought he was but a Polish Jew whose family perished in Hitler's holocaust.Mugabe and his regime are nothing new and we have seen similar brutal regimes with an iron grip on power existing today such as North Korea, Red China and Iran, as well as Saddam Hussein's genocidal regime in Iraq removed by the USA in 2003."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5451335-julie", "userReview": "This book was a follow on from Mukiwa (A white boy in Africa ) which followed the creation of Zimbabwe and the end of the white ruled Rhodesia, the years of civil war and the unseen massacre in Matabeleland which the author was one of the first western journalists to try and bring this horror to the western world. Now Mugabe is in power, this is a story about a countries slide into anarchy and self destruction, while the mad man at the top sits and laughs while his people , black and white starve. The first thing that happens is the taking over of the white's farms by so called war vets, as a reward for fighting on the right side, but they are just bunches of thugs who have no knowledge of farming and no intent to work, the white farmers who have had the land for generations are beaten , killed to get them off the land, their machinery vandalized and sold for scrap. They are left destitiute and many leave Zimbabwe, soon nearly all the farm land is destroyed and then of course there is no food being produced, inflation is out of control, there is no law, shortages of food, medical assistance , water and electricity. Peter now living in the states returns to find his parents living in fear, and in poverty, the visit to the graveyard to visit his sisters grave was heartbreaking and every chapter you get more fearful for his parents lives and ordinary people how did they manage to survive,not just whites everybody is suffering except the top corrupt government officials!! I admire the author greatly he does not write in a self pitying way it is a matter of fact and at no time does he profess a hatred of Africa and its people,it would be so easy to become racist but obviously he sees the whole picture and how everyone is forced to make choices and all the time his love for his homeland and sorrow shine through. At the same time his father makes a confession that he has kept hidden all his life, he is actually Jewish and escaped the Holocaust but lost members of his family. Peter has this to deal with as well and it is a parallel story running throughout the book.This book is uncomfortable reading but once again is bringing the horrors to the attention of the west."}, {"userName": "Neeraj Bali", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5993493-neeraj-bali", "userReview": "When I began reading it, I was cautioned that this is a White man\u2019s version of contemporary Zimbabwe. Even if I assume that it does suffer from that implied infirmity of bias and discount for it, the narrative is moving, heartbreaking and compelling. It rings with credibility. It is a tale the twin and parallel furrows of despair and love, of hopelessness and courage, cruelty and generosity. And yet, this is no outpouring of bitterness alone; just beneath the surface hope for humanity is visible, swimming serenely, waiting for its time to rise.....This is a tale of the family of ex-policeman Peter Godwin as it negotiates an increasingly bleak and even cruel landscape in the country of its adoption. It is a human story that makes the contours of political and economic life in contemporary Zimbabwe rise in relief and we see a vivid picture. Zimbabwe: the horrors of land-distribution, the sheer anarchy, the dark despotic shadow over millions of lives and the de-humanizing of a generation or more are a \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 madness that has afflicted it, like the disease of a moment of passion. One aging man appears to have put Zimbabwe into an unstoppable tail-spin that can have but one ending. Or so one fears. Reading it, I once again marvelled at the miracle of neighbouring South Africa and silently thanked Him for Nelson Mandela. In the post-apartheid decade, this country too could have careened onto the path of vengefulness. It too could have unleashed the pent up fount of vitriol and, in the name of \u2018righting the historic wrongs\u2019 destroyed a beautiful country. Even today, the fears of a Zimbabwe-like slide have not entirely stopped haemorrhaging; we can hope though that with the horrendous example of Zimbabwe to learn from and with the passage of each year, that ominous spectre will fade beyond retrieval. The book is lovingly crafted, each sentence a surprising necklace, studded with imagery that shines and shines in its own lambent brilliance.
