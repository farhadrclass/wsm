The problem is I think she tried to get a little too complex in exploring the dynamics between sisters. The math metaphor fell flat for me.My sister and I always had a decent although not necessarily super close relationship. She passed away rather quickly from lung cancer six years ago. I thought this book might evoke some lost memories or feelings for her, but no such reactions.In fact, I found myself wondering if my sister would've rolled her eyes as much as I did. So I'm either a heartless witch devoid of feeling or the author's development of the various sister characters were so over wrought that most the female characters came off as silly caricatures of how sisters should be... okay... maybe both reasons are accurate. My point is it's not Luanne's best work.I'm being very generous with 3 stars only because of my respect for author and the many books I have enjoyed from her body of work."}, {"userName": "Lolly K Dandeneau", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau", "userReview": "This book was okay- however the love story within was just too hokey for me to be real. The youngest daughter's problems were interesting and she was a little character but everyone else in the book seemed flat. I realize most women rave about these types of novels, I just felt the book could have been a bit darker, more true to life and trauma rather than the unrealistic quick fixes and happy endings. In reality those who suffer trauma don't just snap out of it as if everything is fabulous. Maybe I just don't like happy endings?"}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177641-staci", "userReview": "This is my second time reading Luanne Rice. The first encounter I had with this author was listening to The Edge of Winter on CD. And to be perfectly honest, I wasn't that thrilled with it. The story was fine, but the narrator irritated me to death. But I'm not going to hold that against Luanne and when I saw the blurb about her newest book, it sounded interesting so I requested it from my library. I'm glad that I decided to 'read' the book this time instead of listening to it. I enjoyed her writing so much more this time around. I'm always drawn to stories about families in some sort of crises and this one has that, plus a little bit more. There wasn't really any surprises, but that was o.k. because I was just enjoying these characters and seeing what kind of choices they were going to make. I guess you could say that it was a predictable read. Which for me, every once in awhile, is just fine. I would recommend this as a fun, easy summer read. Or one of those books that you need to read to decompress after experiencing a really emotional or harrowing book earlier. I'm glad that I gave Rice a second chance and I'm sure that I'll pick up another one of her books in the future. Because in the end....I was satisfied."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883089-kathleen", "userReview": "I hated this book.

The main focus was the importance of the relationship between sisters, and what happens when that relationship is strained. But, I was bothered by the use of the \"f\" word a couple of times (seriously unnecessary), and what happened between JD and Maura at the pool (again-unnecessary).Overall, it was a likable story that tugged at the heartstrings, and could have been much better without those things mentioned above."}, {"userName": "Barbara Broekstra", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/621771-barbara-broekstra", "userReview": "This was really the last Luanne Rice book I will read.Too sappy for me ."}, {"userName": "Rita Nye", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22702348-rita-nye", "userReview": "FamilyTo have a sister is to have a lifetime Best Friend.

Suddenly the family home in Ohio seemingly holds too much pain and too many bad memories.Remaining family members are limping along, like injured parties, broken and crippled by the pain. But Maura Shaw is determined to return to her roots in Rhode Island \u2013 a place where her own sister Katherine still lives. Katherine, from whom she has been estranged for many years. A secret betrayal divides them, just as it crushed the final days of Andy and Maura\u2019s marriage before the boat capsize that took his life. Becca Shaw is a math prodigy who uses numbers and equations as a way to understand life. Unfortunately, her pain is also expressed in negative ways \u2013 she retreats, she steals, and she burrows into her secret places. Travis Shaw excels in sports, and despite his own pain, he turns to these pursuits to express his feelings. But he, too, holds secret sorrows within \u2013 and feels somehow responsible for maintaining family unity. Maura Shaw\u2019s new job teaching at Newport Academy is her ticket to starting over. But will the past intrude, preventing a fresh start? And how will she ever find her missing daughter Carrie? Smoothing out the troubled history between Maura and Katherine will be a huge task in and of itself. And at the center of this trouble between the sisters is the key to the final disruption in the Shaw marriage.Luanne Rice treats us to a family saga that shines a spotlight on all the possible twists and turns of family dynamics, and reveals \u2013 very gradually \u2013 how the troubles between family members can finally begin to heal.Told alternately in Becca\u2019s voice and the voice of the third person narrator, we come to learn how things began to spin out of control, and how choices in a summer long ago set in motion a ripple effect \u2013 experienced for many years to come.A relaxing tale, \u201cThe Geometry of Sisters\u201d is unique enough to stand apart from the usual beach read, but doesn\u2019t quite reach the five-star category."}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104791-ginger", "userReview": "First off, this took me about 70-80 pages to really get into, but once I did, I enjoyed it. Beck loses her father & her sister in the same day. Beck was extremely close to her sister and she tries to find some peace in doing Math. It sounds strange & I didn't \"get\" the math aspect of it real well, but I can understand losing yourself in something to take your mind off things. Also, while Beck is mourning her sister's running away, Beck's Mom is also dealing with her own sister issues. And then there's Travis (Beck's brother) who is trying to hold everything together.Loved the ending!! I don't normally use quotes in a review, but these two spoke to me (due to my own sister issues): \"Something happens to sisters who've stopped talking to each other for any stretch of time. Once it has happened--once the pattern has been set, and months and years go by, they get used to it. The unthinkable becomes thinkable. They imagine they can live without each other-because that's what they're doing. Even if they make up, get back together, at the first sign of strife, they might revert to not speaking.\"\"For every day sisters don't talk to each other, a day is taken from the end of their lives. It's that destructive. Their lives are shorter, because their anguish and bitterness destroys them from the inside out. It eats away at their veins, weakens the walls of their hearts.\"I would recommend this book..whether one has a sister or not!"}, {"userName": "Trish Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5401592-trish-jackson", "userReview": "Maura Shaw's husband drowns.

When Beck's family is torn apart by an accident, it is a journey to see how strong the relationships are. Her father dies at sea during a storm. Her sister, Carrie, runs away after she is rescued to try and find her roots. Beck and her brother Travis are left to deal with the fallout with their mother. As the story begins, the family is moving from Ohio to Newport, Rhode Island for a teaching postion so that Maura (the mother) can support her family. There is a lot of history in Newport for Maura as she fell in love there and got pregnant with her oldest child in an affair there. It also was the place where the relationship with her sister Katherine broke down. As Beck and Travis try to adapt to a new school while the search for Carrie continues, Maura must face up to the mistakes of her past in order for her to sort out the present. Beck is wrapped up in math, Travis is wrapped up in football but they all must come together to find what is most important to all of them.This was a very touching book and a story that kept me intersted all the way through."}, {"userName": "Kristy Trauzzi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2709678-kristy-trauzzi", "userReview": "Oh it's Luanne Rice. If you like her, do any of her novels suck? The one issue that I did have with this family was feeling the disconnect. I didn't feel the great love that they shared before the accident, and I didn't feel the disconnect they were feeling throughout the novel. And maybe that's because the story was told from multiple points of view - and each point was very focused on them. Not so much any family ties. The Mom thought of her long love affair (and missing her daughter). Travis thought of pretty girls (and a token worry about his sister) and Beck thought of math, being a klepto (and feeling her sisters presence). It was almost as if any family ties were an afterthought. It was strange. Cuz, if they were that close, and then just disbanded due to the trauma, you would think there would be way more emotions coming to the surface. But, no. And Maura barely thought of her dead husband, which I thought was odd. However, I read the story. The story didn't disappoint. It wasn't very exciting."}, {"userName": "Mandy Sherman", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10650409-mandy-sherman", "userReview": "I was very disappointed in this book. I quit reading it with only about 30 pages to go. One sentence stopped me and I couldn't get past it. When Maura thinks \"I always wanted a love like Ana Karenina or Madam Bovary\" I thought, \"does she know they are adulteress?\". This statement unraveled my perception of the mother. The husband Andy is portrayed in a very flattering light until you find out he is a very unforgiving person. He can't forgive Maura for lying about Carrie's paternity? He was pretty dense not to have doubts about the kid before. This is a modern day novel and I find it pretty pathetic that JD didn't fight her in court for visitation rights to his kid. The story is that he loved them so much he didn't want to force it. Sorry can't relate. He wasn't a bad guy so there was no reason for him to not fight for his kid. He probably didn't care. I just couldn't relate to the characters."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3019917-jessica", "userReview": "This hand-me-down paperback sat on my nightstand for at least a year. I finally decided to pick it up again during a long weekend, figuring that I should be at least somewhat interested since it takes place in Newport, RI, near my hometown.Although I read the novel quickly and even enjoyed the description of Newport, I wasn't super engaged with the plot. The characters felt incredibly superficial, even though the author was careful to try and build multi-dimensional, flawed characters. I also found the \"sisterly connections\" in the novel to be over dramatized. Granted, I don't have a sister of my own (and I also suck at math), so maybe I'm just not capable of relating to the plot. Then again, there are a lot of other books out there that are able to draw me in even IF I don't have a relevant personal experience.I won't ruin the ending, but I will say that it was too rose-colored/unrealistic for my taste and left me unsatisfied."}, {"userName": "Machel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3820228-machel", "userReview": "I just read this recent Luanne Rice novel on my trip back to my brother's wedding and absolutely loved the pace of this book.

New York Times \"bestselling author Luanne Rice explores the complex emotional equations of love and loyalty that hold together three pairs of remarkable sisters. Here in the halls of Newport Academy, a unique private school that has attracted generations of rebels, outcasts, and visionaries, an unforgettable lesson in the eternal truths of sisterhood is about to begin.... After years away, Maura Shaw has returned to Newport, Rhode Island, to teach English at the academy. Behind her lies her life as the perfect Midwestern wife and mother, a life that seemed on the surface to be all she had ever wished for. That illusion vanished in a storm off Mackinac Island in the wake of an accident that engulfed Maura's husband and her older daughter, Carrie. Now, with her son and younger daughter, she hopes to find a new beginning. Newport has never failed to infuse Maura with a sense of mystery and hope. But for fourteen-year-old Beck, the move is a painful upheaval from everything she has ever loved--especially her sister, Carrie. Ever since her sister disappeared, Beck has retreated into the world of mathematics, where principles are permanent, unlike so many other things in life. Without Carrie, Beck has lost half of herself--the half that would have fit in at the elite private school she and her brother, Travis, will now attend. The half that made things right. Still, Beck clings to the hope that her sister will return to them. Beck isn't alone in her struggle to adjust.
