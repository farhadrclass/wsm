And now everyone wants to be assholes! That\u2019s expected now!\u201d She rolled closer. \u201cAnd because I\u2019m not an asshole, I\u2019m suffering! Your fault!\u201dBeast Behaving Badly is the 5th book in the Pride series and it is awesomely hilarious. I really love Blayne and Bo. Bo Novikov is a lion/polar bear hybrid. He is a totally lovable asshole, anti social loner with OCD ( which I totally understand)and a kick ass hockey player. Bo needs everything organised and neat. He says exactly what he means and is all about being punctual, staying on schedule, and list! Bo set his eyes on Blayne 10 years ago and wanted her then, but she ran from him screaming. Now ten years later she is asking him to help toughen her up for her roller derby team, since he is the asshole of hockey and all. Even though he doesn't have time on his schedule he is willing to help Blayne because he wants a chance to be in her life. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI\u2019m a wolfdog meant to be free! To roam the hills and roads as I see fit. Not to be held down by your expensive time keeping devices. I can\u2019t live in this kind of\u2014ooh! Earmuffs.\u201d \n\u201cWill it make you happy if I do this?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she hissed, frustrated. \u201cIt would make me happy.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Blayne blinked, her fists unfisting. \u201cJust like that?\u201d \u201cYep. I like making you happy.\u201dBlayne Thorpe is a wild dog/wolf hybrid. She is a super perky,hyper, sweet, all over the place scatter brain, but she can turn killer with mad skills (she learned from her daddy) when she has to. She is always trying to help others she goes out of her way to be cheery and nice to everyone. Which is the problem she is having, her roller derby team thinks she is too nice and will cause their team to lose the upcoming championship. So Blayne gets Bo to help toughen her up, but she also wants to help him too. Blayne can see that Bo is lonely and she wants to help him be more nice and make friends, cut loose and live a little. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you, you idiot. I\u2019m in love with you. That\u2019s why I\u2019m panicking!\u201d She marched to the door and yelled, \u201cAnd our children will not be freaks!\u201d\nBo\u2019s eyes narrowed, and his mane dropped to his shoulders. \u201cOh, no,\u201d her father said next to him with a level of sarcasm even Bo was finding hard to take. \u201cYour kids won\u2019t be freaks at all.\u201d \u201cI love your daughter, sir,\u201d Bo said low for Mr. Thorpe\u2019s benefit only. \u201cBut don\u2019t think for a second I won\u2019t snap your neck like a twig if you get on my nerves.\u201d The wolf looked up at him, brows raised, and Bo added, \u201cNo, really.\u201dBlayne and Bo together had me laughin so damn hard. The way she is all over the place chaotic and it driving Bo crazy. I love that Bo learns to let loose and would do nice things just to make Blayne happy. I think it is great that even though they both could be other things (Blayne could be mean and Bo could be nice) they are still true to who they really are. I love the fact that Blayne could go from sweet, nutty girl to trained killer in 60 seconds flat. There is some seriously hot scenes in this book. I love a lot of the new characters we meet for the first time in this book, and really enjoyed seeing some old favorites from past books. I really enjoy how closely the books tie together and build onto each other giving the characters more depth. A great read and a awesome addition to the series. Below I leave a couple of my favorite quotes from this book:He grabbed her around the waist and lifted her up, enjoying her squealed giggles; her arms looping around his neck, her legs around his waist. \u201cAnd now?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAnd now, I\u2019d have to say, you have me where you want me, Marauder. Genghis would be proud.\u201d \u201cThen you better kiss me quick before I burn your peasant village to the ground and take all your women as my concubines.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d she whispered, staring at his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m trapped between wanting to help my people and keep my innocence. What will I do?\u201d \u201cWhat you always do, Blayne,\u201d he told her honestly while pressing his body into hers. \u201cHelp everyone else.\u201d She leaned in, her hands moving from his shoulders to his face, her fingers stroking his jaw. \u201cMy God,\u201d she whispered, her sweet breath brushing against his mouth, \u201cthe sacrifices I\u2019m forced to make for my people.\u201d\u201cBo!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Blayne cleared her throat and said, \u201cUh . . . Bold Novikov, I\u2019d like you to meet my father. Ezra Louis Thorpe.\u201d Praying she was kidding\u2014but already knowing she wasn\u2019t\u2014he looked down the porch stairs. Unsmiling, black, powerfully built, in his fifties, and still wearing a buzz cut that was mere millimeters from bald, Bo knew this was Blayne\u2019s father. \u201cSir,\u201d Bo said before raising his gaze to Blayne\u2019s. \u201cI am so naked,\u201d he whispered. What kind of first impression could he be making right now? \u201cI\u2019m almost positive he noticed that,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cAlthough if you go inside and get some pants . . .

When it seems like she won't be playing in their bouts because of being too polite she gets Bo Novikov, one of the hardest hockey player in the shifter leagues, to train her.Bo Novikov, a lion-polar bear hybrid, was fascinated with Blayne Thorpe from the first moment he laid eyes on her ten years ago but she run away from him screaming. Ten years later he isn't about to let her get away from him again. So he agrees to help her train and tries to find a way into the wolfdogs life.I love this freaking book! It is my favorite one in the series and one of my favorite books in general.Blayne is such a great heroine. She is a genuinely nice person, cute and polite to everyone but she can kick some serious ass if the situation demands it from her. I love how this girl goes from funny, cheerful, always nice to stone cold killer in seconds!Bo is also so cute. He is OCDed, too organised, too punctual, too tidy. He is everything the crazy wolfdog isn't. He is also exactly the type of guy that could even out Blayne's absentmindedness. It probably wouldn't be in RL but his obssession with lists and schedules is just adorable to read about.PS. I love the supportive characters in this series. SL is a master at creating interesting people around her couples.\nQuotes\nHer eyes narrowed. \"You're not going to kill me, skin me, and wear my head as a hat?\"Yep. He was entertained. And, no. It wasn't normal. Instead of answering her question, he asked his own. \"Do you want me to?\"\"Not really.\"\"Then why are you asking?\"\"Because according to my father, many teachers, and quite a few anger-management counselors, I seem to lack that little internal device that stops things that are best left unsaid from being said.\" Her eyes grew wide and she briefly covered her mouth with her hand.\"Are you a virgin?\" she whispered.\"What? No!\"\"But when do you find time with that rigid schedule of yours? I mean prisoners at Rikers have more freedom! \"\"So you were using her as bait? And Christ knows, my daughter hates to be lied to,\" he laughed. \"So she stuck you with me. Right? This was her brilliant idea?\"Feeling a small sense of relief that the man understood the situation better than Van could hope and, more important, seemed to be taking it so well, Van nodded. \"You could say that.\"Thorpe chuckled a little more. \"That girl. Look, why don't I make this easy for you and me?Blayne likes to feel we have a rough-and-tumble acrimonious relationship, and I let her. Because in a bizarre, Blayne-like way it makes her feel more normal when, in fact, my girl's weird. I know she's weird. Her friends know she's weird. And we all accept it because she's weird, but she's also amazing.\"\"Why are you still standing here?\"His uncle leaned back, peering out into the hallway. \"I need you to come to town with me,\" he muttered.\"You're not on my schedule.\"His uncle scowled. \"I'm not what now?\"\"I wrote out a schedule. You're not on it.\"\"Uh-huh. Can you fit me on the schedule?\"Bo grabbed the notepad off his night table and looked it over. \"Well, let's see, maybe I could move-\"Grigori snatched the pad from him and tore it up, throwing the tiny pieces at Bo's head.Bo stared at him. You don't think I made a copy?\" \"That won't happen,\" Blayne's hybrid said, and shifted. Shifted into something only Blayne could truly love.Yep. I'm gonna have freak grandkids. As Bo eased up behind him, Mr. Thorpe glanced at him over his shoulder. He snorted, shook his head. \"I bet she loves those fangs. Trust me, at some point, if she hasn't already, she's gonna ask to hang from them.\"He hitched Blayne up a little higher. \"I have a question first.\"\"Of course I'll marry you! \" Blayne cheered, throwing her arms around his neck.\"I wasn't going to ask that. \"\"Oh.\" She un-hugged him. \"Sorry.\"\"I was going to ask you that on Sunday. At three forty-five p.m. Before the surprise romantic dinner but after my Sunday laps in the pool. It was on myschedule!\" he finished on a bellow.\"I know! \" she bellowed back. \"I saw it.

Mostly because I \u201cgot\u201d Blayne. I like shiny things, I would totally wear bunny rabbit ear muffs and sparkly red ice skates, I\u2019m the peacekeeper just like her and hate seeing people being rude- but don\u2019t mistake us for wimps because I\u2019ll claw your eyes out if you try to hurt someone I love\u2026 just like her.In Blayne\u2019s story we find her hunting down Bo Novikov, ruthless #1 hockey player extraordinaire. Having locked eyes with him long ago, she knows exactly the type of guy he is- which is why she ran in the opposite direction all those years ago. But now she needs him to teach her how to be as fierce in the roller derby circuit as he is on the ice to take the championship. Bo knows the scatter-brained mixbreed wolf/dog is gonna be hell on his meticulously planned schedule but most of him doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s wanted her for a very long time and since he has everything he\u2019s ever wanted in his professional career, it\u2019s time to make her his. Throw in a group of full humans kidnapping mix breeds for uber-amped dogfights, and the rest of the shifters in Laurenston\u2019s crazy world, and you\u2019ve got a novel that is off the charts vicious as well as deliciously sexy. Oh yeah, funny too. First, as I\u2019ve said before, this series is brutal. As Nathan Fillion (Firefly) said about Joss Whedon (Firefly, Buffy and Angel Creator), Laurenston isn\u2019t afraid to kick a character in the nuts to get a laugh. And it works. Second, despite the harshness, the characters fierce devotion to each other makes them so empathetic you simply don\u2019t care that they\u2019re trailing blood across the pages like a Freddy Krueger movie. But then they are mostly predator animals so I guess you cant get much more truer to a character in a novel than that. And THAT I respect about an author more than just about anything.Lastly, Bo Novikov can organize my shoes any day. Just sayin.*edited June 8th,2011: I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars.

No real hate, but who doesn't love a meme involving The Queen? I really need to start using more of these! Ok, seriously, loved it.

Sign says \"do not read if you can't handle various euphemisms for naughty bits\"Plan on reading more by the author:  I'm not even gonna dignify that one with an answer. Synopsis: We're still dealing with the ring of humans grabbing hybrid shifters to use in pit fights. This time, Blayne, the plumber, and Bo, the hockey player, get all caught up in it. After an attempt to kidnap little Ms Blayne, we go walk about with all the bears from Bo's home town, read some serious ass kicking from Blayne, learn that Bo is totally tied to his schedule and cleaning and other OCD behaviors and have an all around good time. And how could I forget all of the awesome roller derby and hockey business? Awesome. Just awesome. Hero: Bo. I mentioned that OCD business, right? And he's a perfect big asshole. Part lion / part polar bear ... I'd be OCD too. This man has sarcasm down to a T. Heroine: Blayne. Seriously? Yip, yip, yippy hippy dog / wolf hybrid. Flower girl, meets sometimes idiot meets sometimes dog rescuer meets perpetually stoned and hyped up. At times, you're all \"Stop talking\" and other times you're all \"You go girl\". Let's not forget to mention her awesome father who has instilled some scary, scary self preservation / matrix like sh!t in his baby girl. Blaine alternately annoys and kicks ass. Why it did or didn't work for me: Totally worked. I loved these two together but even more than that, I loved the crazy cast of characters and Blayne's obsession with yelling Dee-Ann at every opportunity just to make said Dee-Ann uncomfortable. Every single time she yelled it, I fell out laughing. My one complaint is Blayne's bail on / lack of communication issue later in the book. But, dudes and dudettes, that is one complaint. This book is high-sterical and hot and fun and damned if I can make my review compete with it. In fact, I pale in comparison.

The relationship that blooms between these two is funny, and they definitely come under the heading \u201copposites attract\u201d, with Blayne being a carefree and fun loving fruitcake and Bo being OCD, constantly sticking to lists and schedules. The characters from previous books also making appearances, especially Lock and Gwen, Dee Ann and Ric, so you get to alook in at previous characters and the development of characters books yet to come.I would definitely recommend this book, it has many many laugh out loud moments in it, and I love the fact that the females in this books are the crazy dangerous ones with the men holding them back.

The story had very few scenes, very mild by these series standards, but the love story among such different hero and heroine was such a blast, I was smiling all the way till the end. Loved the secondary characters, the dialogs, the way this author writes, a keeper. HERO is a Performer and a Loner, a famous ruthless hockey player champ, obsessive-compulsive, antisocial, rude.

I loved Bo and Blayne - so comical and so right for each other. Now I absolutely cannot wait until Ric and Dee's story comes out!!Blayne and Bo had met briefly 10 years ago, when Bo had spotted her and she freaked out and ran off. Bo has never forgotten her, nor she him. Blayne was freaked out when she saw Bo again, after all those years thinking he was a serial killer trying to get to her. Bo (a lion polar bear mix breed) known for being The Maurader in the wide world of shifter hockey, has a soft spot for the little Wolfdog.About to be replaced on the Derby team for being too nice, Blayne turns to Bo to learn to toughen up and hang with the big dogs. Reluctantly, Bo agrees. After a few sessions, they become closer and on their first date and during their first kiss, they're ambushed by the full-humans stalking Blayne for the shifter fighting ring they The Group is trying to take down.Blayne and Bo are both injured in a car crash and transferred to Bo's hometown by the bears, where they don't like wolves - at all. Ric and Lock try to bring Blayne back to NY with them, but she refuses - partly because she thinks Ric microchipped her and partly because she wants Bo (Bold) to spend time with his Uncle.After much worry for the safety of Blayne being in bear country, the town falls in love with her and Bo falls even more in love with her. She even attracts all the mysterious stray dogs in town. When her father comes to get her, they've figured out the fighting ring is based in bear country and they strike to take it down. They do, they kill some bad guys (especially Blayne to everyone's surprise) and they save some mixed breeds.They have some issues when they get back to NY, but figure out they're meant for each other. There's a roller derby bout and a hockey championship game and some happy endings. Again great book. I loved Bo's quirks regarding time, lists and schedules - and I loved Blayne's utter disregard for them.

The characters in this book take some getting used too, they are extreme and take on quite a few characteristics of their shifter animal. If you have not read any books in this series before, I advise you to do so before reading this one, as the world and the characters are special, you really need the full picture from start to finish.Blayne Thorpe and Bo Novikov met 10 years ago, the end result had a 17 year old Blayne running in fear of her life from a very intense, misunderstood Bo.(hilarious reading moment)Now they have run into each other again. Bo is just as intense and Blayne still thinks he is a crazy man who wants to murder her in his dungeon. He was no longer the six-one, two hundred fifty pound serial killer looking sub adult she'd met all those years ago. Nope. He was now a seven-one, three hundred-seventy-eight pound serial killer looking adult Bo, has a unexplainable immediate attraction to Blayne that hasn't disappeared even though 10 years has gone buy. He has gone on to become one of the most formiddable and feared but also best Hockey player in the shifter league. Blayne is an extemely hyper, unorganised, easily distracted plumber by day, roller derby player by night and a friend to all. Unfortuanely , Blayne is in some series trouble and we fine Bo stepping up to protect her from herself and from the league of humans that are hunting her for there illegal dog fights.The storyline more than kept my interest, with action, mystery and adventure. Brilliant characters, old and new show up in this book and they are all just gems!! The Bear community in Maine was a real win for me. Oh and of course, roller derby, what fun!!!If I had to go on and on about something in this book and series it would be the humour. They are lots of fun and Beast Behaving Badly is just full of laugh out loud moments. Blaynes craziness, the fact that she is always getting herself into ridiculous situations. Her bubbly friendliness,in my mind I see her like a unstoppable overyly excited labrador. Just, go, go, go with a constantly wagging tail. I am sure we are made to see her like this, like I said the people in these books really take on there animals traits in their human form. Bo, who shifts into a half polar bear, half lion, is hilariously irrational, he has schedules and lists and loves to be on time, clean. He is really focused, the total opposite of Blayne. This leads to many funny confrontation scenes between these two characters. Just reading each of their inner monologues was a good time. Such vivid personalities really make a book for me.Shelly Laurenston has done a great job developing a different shifter world, that is interesting but isn't as dark and daunting as some of the books out there at the moment. The Pride series is fun and light, without being flaky. Easy to loose yourself in, highly entertaining, a real winner in my book."}, {"userName": "Ivy Deluca", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7751086-ivy-deluca", "userReview": "Bo Novikov and Blayne Thorpe are examples of characters that balance each other out through their dysfunctions. She's completely flaky and he's pretty much an a-hole. They aren't everyone's cup of tea, and that's exactly why I like them. In the end, they help each other grow while keeping true to their core character traits.When I started reading Shelly Laurenston/G.A. Aiken's books, frankly I was surprised that I enjoyed them, since her stories can be formulaic, but I found myself tearing through her series book by book in record time. Her saving grace is her dialogue and humor - it's definitely subjective, but I get it and I loved it.This book isn't as sexual as earlier books, but it fit these particular extreme personalities, and it gave the added bonus of seeing their relationship unfold slowly and realistically and I was completely satisfied once they did come together. I would have loved to have seen more of their sexual attraction develop a bit earlier, but the humor more than made up for it. The mark of a good book is whether I think about it afterwards and my desire to re-read. Considering I've read it 3... I've lost count of how many times so far, I have to say it's my fave of the series.**UPDATE** I also own all the audiobooks for the Pride series and I LOVE them.

Other than that she just seemed dumb and ignorant.And yes , the part where she goes off to chase a squirrel in the middle of a conversation just illustrates it( in \"The Mane Squeeze\") Well Bo .. as far as I read the book .. was nice. But unfortunately it was REALLY hard to enjoy the story as I felt like one of the main characters had a severe mental disorded. That being said .. I completely LOVED the last book which was why I expected more from this. ( And by more I mean something that I can read more than 100 pages without wanting to skip like .. 70 % of the book. And that is why I would want to give this book a 1,5 stars. Even tho I cant bring myself to finish that book since I feel like its waste of time and my nerves I do like the pride series."}, {"userName": "Crazy for Books (Stephanie)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2949869-crazy-for-books-stephanie", "userReview": "NetGalley free readNow I gave this book five stars and I rarely ever give out a five star review. I did because Blayne was a hoot. I laughed so hard at times I couldn't see straight or breath. I loved Bo as well. The first time he saw her, he gave her a look that sent her running away. Ten years later that same look is just as frightening, but in a different way. I am a true believer of things happening for a reason and Bo thinks several times that it was for the best that she ran away the first time. He was 19 and would have been so addicted to her, he would have never focused on his hockey career. Now that he's more established, he can cut his concentration a bit more.I loved all of Bo's lists and schedule. Getting involved with Blayne means all of that is out of the window. I also loved Blayne using her personality and amping it up a bit in order to drive DeeAnn crazy. I love how Bo was a 'Bear' in a China shop when he wanted something. He was direct in every aspect of his life, to hilarious conclusions. I loved how Blayne turned all the Bears in Ursus County into her biggest fans, since they are supposed to hate wolfdogs.One of my favorite parts of the book was when Niles Van Holtz goes to speak with Blayne's father after she'd been kidnapped, gotten away, but hurt, and is now in Ursus County and wouldn't leave:\n\"Look, why don't I make this easy for you and me?\"\n\n\"Blayne likes to feel we have a rough-and-tumble acrimonious relationship, and I let her. Because in a bizarre, Blayne-like way, it makes her feel more normal when, in all fact, my girl's weird. I know she's weird. Her friends know she's weird. And we all accept it because she's weird, but she's also amazing. And I want my weird but amazing girl safe. So this is what you're going to do. You're going to track down the f**ckers who grabbed her and you're going to do what the Group does best, which is wipe their full-human assess from the planet. You're going to do this in a timely manner and then, when its safe, I'll go with you and bring my girl back. And, even after staying with those goddamn bears in Ursus County--who, by the way hate wolves and are terrified of wolfdogs--my girl better be as annoyingly perky and helpful as she was when she was grabbed, or I'll raise Van Holtz territory to the ground from here to the West Coast, leaving nothing but craters the size of the Atlantic Ocean when I'm done.\"\nOr when Ezra comes to Ursus County to get Blayne and walks up on Bo naked butting Blayne's books on her as she's about to go for a run. Her father sees that she's been marked and tells her that her kids will be freaks.\nShe marches to the door and yelled \"And our children will not be freaks!\"\n\n\"Except their mother already is,\" her father yelled back.\nWhen Bo's mane starts to grow when he's upset that Blayne is hugging one of her male friends.\n\"Oh,no,\" her father said, next to him with a level of sarcasm even Bo was finding hard to take. \"Your kids won't be freaks at all.\" \"I love your daughter, sir,\" Bo said low for Mr. Thorpe's benefit only. \"But don't think for a second I won't snap your neck like a twig if you get on my my nerves.\" The wolf looked up at him, brows raised, and Bo added, \"No, really.\" Laughing, the wolf walked away from him.\nI loved the interactions with all the character and when Blayne was hyper and a bit wacky causing havoc to Bo's well structured world. She wants to be friends with everyone even if they don't want to be friends with her. She's willing to force the issue.But also, the fighting scenes were well written. I love that Ezra had Blayne trained like she was in the Core by different people, so she would always be able to take care of herself. The only people who know this are her father and her best friend Gwen, until the night of the attempted kidnapping. Bo is so anxious to try to get to her, that he's shocked and thrown from the vehicle when he views what Blayne can do with a knife and how fast and precise she moves.They hide it from the Bears of Ursus as well as others because her type is considered unpredictable at the best of times. She has always been afraid what people woud do if they knew she was well trained. But Lock and Ric as well as DeeAnn, who thinks she's as annoying as a teacup poodle, are thrown when they view her in action. Blayne's father knows she can take care of herself, so his responses to her perceived danger very muted.The only thing I didn't like about the book, which I can only assume is because I hadn't read the first 4 in the series, was some of the characters came and disappeared quickly. But I obviously didn't take anything off of this for that because I loved it so much. I also have Wolf With Benefits, which I can't wait to read as well."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4234612-julie", "userReview": "Omg!!

His lack of people skills and strict training regimen though might be the reason Blayne Thorpe runs away in terror when he first meets her but ten years later he gets another shot. Blayne Thrope may be a hybrid wolf dog but that doesn't mean she has to act like one. Always optimistic and always perky Blayne believes a stranger is just a friend she hasn't met. Well. Until she meets Bo Novikiov. He's scary. And big. And has a reputation of his puck, his game, his rules. Anyone getting in his way will experience pain. Lots and lots of pain. But. There are exceptions to every rule and apparently Blayne is one of them.* * * * * I'm gonna start out my review by saying how mad I am. Totally and completely mad. Why? Because I'm only now reading this book. OK. I've read a number of installments in the series (which can be read as standalones) but only came to read this one because of a reading challenge I'm in. Little did I realize that this is and will remain in the my personal top three books of all time list. I loved this so much I'm devastated I finished it. I'm now experiencing extreme book hangover. You know the feeling. Any true bibliophile does at least. Well, I'm there. Bo & Blayne. Two total polar opposites who in the real world would have zero chance of becoming a couple. He's big - she's small. He's rude - she's polite. He's a loner - she's a social butterfly. He's regimented and keeps to a strict schedule - she the 'flies by the seat of her pants' sort of girl. He's organized - she believes a cluttered house is a happy home. He's rich. She's not. Blayne, wolfdog, and Bo, bearcat, are perfect for each other and readers can look forward to sensuous adult content scenes between the two. Well, after they work through their issues and maybe deal with a crisis or two. Or three. All while dealing with family and friends who have definite opinions of their own on why the two shouldn't become a couple. Oh, and parental units who have a thing or two to say too. Yup. I can't say enough how really terrific this story was. The story itself is a testament in how the right woman can change a man and vise versa. Not giving away much but their relationship was a two way street marked with snarky sarcastic dialogue, total air head behavior, and devious cunning manipulation. Got a bit embarrassing as I'd break out in spontaneous laughter (I deny snorting as I do not snort) in the most inappropriate of places. Lesson learned - do not read this book in a public setting that frowns on loud laughter, giggling, and oooing and awwwwing. But then again. Bo's rubbing off on me. Read this book anywhere you damn well please.....I'm gonna add that there is a side plot to this story that I just wont' say much more than Blayne is being hunted by stalkers who want to use her in an illegal dogfighting scheme. Dee-Annnn !!!!!!!!!End conclussion: I loved this book. It's funny, romantic & entertaining. All this contained in an action adventure story line supported by a cast of secondary characters who add their own quirkiness to the mix. The author did an excellent job of adapting base animal characteristics to their human host so as to be totally believeable. Each character WAS the human representation of a bear, fox, lion, dog, wolf, etc. I'm currently grieving that this book is done and I'm not gonna be able to continue following Bo & Blayne, my rockstar couple. Luckily, this is a series book and the author has to bring them back. Right? Fingers crossed."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4726159-amanda", "userReview": "This was the first book that I have read my Shelly Laurenston, I had seen this series floating around on Amazon and Goodreads but had never taken the plunge. So when I saw this book pop up on Net Galley I thought I\u2019d give it a whirl. I knew I was picking it up on book five but it looked like it could be read as a standalone. Where I was not incorrect in that, it can be read standalone, I would recommend that you read it as a part of the series. I say this not because it really follows a series timeline but more that there is so many supporting characters that have obviously been introduced and you are expected to already know them. I\u2019m still not 100% sure that I got all of the characters figured out but I think I got most of them. Despite the fact that I got some of the characters confused I absolutely adored this book! It was funny, sexy and entertaining as all get out. Blayne was freak\u2019n adorable! I loved her! She always had something funny to say and was always getting into some sort of trouble. And really who else would have badgers after them! Blayne is fun and infectious, before you know it, she has you under her spell. You can\u2019t help but like her. She is constantly underestimated. Even her friends underestimate her, they have no idea what she is really capable of and can\u2019t seem to look beyond the surface, but Blayne has some tricks up her sleeves. One of those tricks is taming the big bad hockey player Bo Novikov. Once she realizes he isn\u2019t trying to kill her, she decides he should have a personality make over and proceeds to tame the beast! Bo is undercover funny! He is so uptight you would never expect him to have jokes, but he actually does! He gives Blayne as good as he takes. He is such a cranky mean a$$, it\u2019s great. But he has this fantastic intensity about him, all that focus and energy that he directs at Blayne, it\u2019s sexy as hell! I never thought I would like such a cranky, up tight character, but watching Blayne crack him, is so damn entertaining! These two go round and round in a battle of wills, as these complete opposites attract. Blayne tried to regulate Bo to friend zone but he refuses to stay there. He\u2019s a man that knows what he wants and will stop at nothing to get it. The story is fast paced and hilarious! Ms. Laurenston has such a wonderful sense of humor. This may have been my first book by her but it definitely will not be my last, I can promise you that. I need to go back to the beginning to see what I missed because of all of the books are like this one, I may have to add this series to my favorite series list. *This book was provided through NetGalley for a honest review.

With a wicked sense of humor, utterly unique characters, tons of snark, more than a touch of casual violence, and just a hint of steam, this book was, in a single word, fun.Though this is the fifth book in the series, the only real obstacle to a newcomer would be the almost overwhelming cast of characters to keep up with, but overall, I think that it worked quite well as a standalone.I loved the dynamic between Blayne and Bo, but more than that, I loved all of the shifters and how the interacted with each other. The rivalries between species, as well as the major differences between Blayne and Bo certainly kept things interesting, as did the sub-plot with the kidnappings and pit-fighting.Highly entertaining, the only real things that pulled my enjoyment down were the casual public nudity and the occasional departure from quirky and into annoying with Blayne\u2019s behavior.

This was just such a weird read... I don't even know where to beguin. I will admit this book was way better than the previous one... still I think that after the first 3 books the series just changed in a way I don't approve of. While I found those 3 first books funny and different from everything else out there, I found this last 2 too predictable and not as funny. I will even admit I missed the dogs a bit, lol. I think my problem was with Gwen and Blaney, I just never really liked them, although Blaney got to be a more interesting character once we got to know her better. I guess I will just never get to love this type of reads as much as other more serious books. I need more substance on the main characters. It's cute for the characters to have a defect or a vain or superfitial side, but when that's all there is about them they just stop being cute IMHO. I just don't understand why everybody loves this series so much... I keep reading the books on it because I already started but I know it wouldn't have made things any different in my life to not have ever started it. I just don't think this is a series worth spending time on, I just can't stop reading it now because I already started it but if I could go back I wouldn't."}, {"userName": "KimberlyRose", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5209299-kimberlyrose", "userReview": "How was this even accepted by a print publisher, let alone how did this receive a overall rating of 4.41?!
