My advice is to forget them both and move on.\"\n\n Let me be clear: I have never 'DNF'd a book before, but I came dangerously close to closing this one for good.The writing had multiple rough edges which could have been smoothed out with the use of an editor or even careful proofreading.The dialogue was awkward and stilted, there was questionable sexual innuendo, and completely unbelievable (to the point of mood-killing) pillow talk...There were a ton of superfluous details regarding makeup, clothing, etc which managed to turn a story about a group of people in their late-twenties / mid-thirties, to a story about obnoxious teenagers.This sophomoric vibe was enhanced by the endless angst which dripped from every page...I might have been able to handle all of those detractors if not for one VERY IMPORTANT fact: The three main characters were completely unlikable.I couldn't get invested in this twisted love triangle because I didn't have a desire to see any of these people happy. Why should they be rewarded for making ridiculous decisions over and over again?I guess the only redeeming thing about this entire book is that these three deserved each other.I don't remember ever wanting to strangle a fictional character as much as I did with Jacqueline.JACQUELINE\n\n\"This can't possibly end well and I know you are smart enough to know it.\"\n\n Jacqs has herself stuck in a love triangle between her cheating asshole ex-boyfriend Bond and her ex-boyfriend's domineering best friend Red...Some might be inclined to believe that these two men are taking advantage of the dim-witted Jacqueline... But Jacqs got herself into this ridiculous position... She seems particularly adept at lamenting all of the self-inflicted problems in her life, yet seems incapable of making any positive decisions for herself.BOND\n\n\"When will you understand that my dating other women doesn't take away from my love for you?\"\n\n Yeah... No... Bond & Jacqs have been on-again-off-again for almost a decade. He cheats, she's helpless to refuse his charms, she keeps going back to him, he keeps fucking everyone else.And I'm supposed to understand Jacqueline's love for him?RED\n\n\"Thank you.\"\"What for?\"\"Loving me back.\"\"You didn't give me much chance to refuse.\"\n\n Apparently Red has been in love with Jacqueline for a long time and it's been killing him to watch his best friend treat her like shit... So in oder to hide his feelings for her, he's been treating her with a combination of hostility and complete disinterest for years... Sounds like a knight in shining armor to me...I can't recommend this book to anyone.I can't think of a single reason to enjoy so much absurdity...***I was gifted with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review***If you ever wondered how honest my reviews are for books I'm provided, you now have your answer."}, {"userName": "Serena Kett", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17414178-serena-kett", "userReview": "Mind Blowing Read!I've been following this Author for quite some time now...you could actually call it stalking if you like lol..I feel so privileged to be Blakely's test reader.

Apparently his body produces some ferocious pheromones, because the ladies love him and he just can\u2019t seem to say, \u201cNo\u201d to them. He fishes in \u201cthe pond\u201d too, but he also visits everyone else\u2019s pond! He\u2019s got it bad for Jacqs, but he has very little will power when it comes to also \u201cdating\u201d other women and always seems to mess things up with Jacqs \u2013 but those damn pheromones are just irresistible.\n\u275dSimply, I was crazy horny and hanging out with a past lover, specifically the one with the most magnificent cock I ever had the pleasure of experiencing, did not help matters.\u275e\nMEET RED: 35 YO SW/M, 6\u20192\u201d tall Well, they call him Red for a reason, so I will let you guess that one \u263a Red\u2019s a born entertainer and he is definitely in \u201cthe pond\u201d. He is also Bond\u2019s BFF. He and Jacqs have always had this love/hate thing going on, but of course you\u2019ve probably guessed that they were just using the \u201chate\u201d part as an excuse to avoid the attraction and chemistry they so obviously share.So, what\u2019s the problem? The problem is that Jacqs soon finds herself STUCK IN BETWEEN two sexy men and for once, it\u2019s her turn to have her cake and eat it too! \n\u275dWhen will you understand that my dating other women doesn\u2019t take away from my love for you?\u275e\nGAH! Bond! What an idiot! Like that would actually fly with 98% of the women in the world\u2026 This makes him sound like a douche-bag, but he really isn\u2019t \u2013 I actually adored him once he got is big-ole-head out of his ass. He just has some major issues he needs to work through.Red, on the other hand, has his shit together and he knows what he wants. He\u2019s dominant, driven and loyal to the core, but sometimes in life, you just have to dive in headfirst and think about the consequences later.\n\u275dAfraid of breaking the spell that I knew would end once reality set in, I sat, waiting. He ran his hands up my neck, followed by his mouth, kissing and nibbling. Chills fluttered down my spine and I moaned, \u201cOh, Red.\u201d Wetness pooled in my panties and I wanted him to take me. I wanted to know what his cock looked like, tasted like. I didn\u2019t care if we ever spoke again, or if my motivations stemmed from getting back at Bond. Red had sparked an intense need and I wanted him to take me.\u275e\nWhen the trio finally comes up with a solution to their love-triangle (about \u00be of the way into the book), traditional rules get thrown out the window and the result is B-O-O-M! OFF THE CHARTS! STUCK IN BETWEEN is all about complicated relationships and all the drama that ensues. It\u2019s a m\u00e9nage read, but it is so much more than that and I totally loved it. This is a great book for those who are \u201cold pros\u201d and have read loads of m\u00e9nage themed books and it\u2019s an awesome book for those looking to check out the m\u00e9nage scene for the first time.

I can't wait to see what else is in store for this series!UPDATE: (from the blog)When I first started this book, I wasn't sure what to expect, except that there would be a LOT of relationship tension. And there definitely was that, but there was SO MUCH MORE than that too!There are so many things going on in this novel, in a good way. This isn't just about sex, it's about life: jobs, dating, friendships, horrible bosses, emotional and physical healing...the list goes on and on. This is my second Blakely Bennett experience, and something I love about her books is that the characters are put onto the page all the way down to a psychological level. You learn about their personality traits, what drives them, how their pasts have affected them emotionally, etc. In the end, I grew to love all three of the main characters. But in the very beginning, we meet that man we love to hate: Bond. He's one of those guys who says, \"I love you, and I want to be with you, but I also need to continue my sexual escapades with strangers.\" Say WHAT?! But of course, Bond is Jacqs best friend, and she loves him too, no matter what she tries to tell herself.Next comes Red. He's been playing the role of Bond's other best friend, who hates Jacqs for whatever reason he has come up with. But then, Red decides he's had enough. He's kept to the sidelines, knowing that his best friend loves Jacqs. But after Bond hurts her again, he jumps on a chance to have her for his own...and he's not going down without a fight!And poor Jacqs is confused as heck. Who can blame her? Besides the fact that she already loves Bond, she's starting to fall for Red, and her problems at work, she is coming between Bond and Red, who have been friends much longer than Jacqs has known them. From outside her bubble, we can all scream at her, and tell her exactly what she should do. But inside her bubble, dealing with matters of the heart, it's hard to say if we would follow our own advice. At one point in the novel, Jacqs really grows a backbone, and tells both guys they have some things to figure out before she'll work things out with either of them. In the long run, Jacqs becomes a much stronger woman than she was in the beginning. And I just wanted to hug her by the end!Now, I'm sure you're all wondering, \"BUT HOW IS THE CHEMISTRY?!?!\" Let's just say this...it is hot, hot, HOTT! And I will warn you right now, in case the cover didn't already give it away, there are some menage scenes...and they are steamy!"}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24172847-angie", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads.

When I first saw the cover of this book, I thought, \"Yeah! MFM action!!!\" When I read the synopsis for the book, I realized they probably wouldn't all end up in bed together, but there would probably be some very hot sex. I am very happy to say that I was right and wrong! This book has some very hot sex scenes and (praise Jesus!) a SUPER DUPER hot MFM scene. As for the relationships in the book I could really see the struggle that Jacqs was feeling. Although I personally found myself rooting for \"Team Red\", I could see the powerful connection she has with both men and how she could be struggling with who to be with. I could not put this book down. I read it in about two days staying up well past midnight both nights because I just had to read \"one more chapter\"!!! (Blakely will be receiving my bill from Starbucks shortly!) The only time I ever wanted to put the book down was when the book would get so hot I would need to *ahem* relieve some tension. I will absolutely be reading this book again and reading more books written by Blakely Bennett in the future. I also love how each chapter comes with a song title.

Three's a crowd...right? Wrong! Stuck in Between is centered around a very close knit group of friends, some of who are in relationships or have had previous sexual encounters with each other. The stars of the show are Jacqs, Bond & Red, who each have very unique history with one another. Jacqs & Bond have been friends with benefits for 8 years and both seem to treasure the bonds of that friendship. They both have deep feelings for one another but because of some things that happened in Bonds past, things that Jacqs is unaware of, he has commitment issues and constantly leaves her side for other women. Bond & Red- both Dominant Alpha-male, have been best friends since childhood. Both have strong personalities, charm, and ooze sexual energy. They are also different in a lot of ways, Bond the bachelor who works at a bar and lives atop said bar. Red owns his own business, yacht and home on the waterway. Jacqs & Red- for years Jacqs believes that Red hates her. They are constantly making snide remarks to each other and seem to barely \"put up\" with each other during their social gatherings. Jacqs believes that his distaste for her is due to jealousy over the friendship between her and Bond. When the truth comes out Jacqs is put in a difficult position and learns things about Red that she could have never dreamed. This story highlights friendship, love, hurt, loss and the inner turmoil we experience with love. The sex scenes are amazing and not like some of the more popular BDSM books that are coming out now. These men are Dominant but they not in an abusive a-hole kind of way. It is hot, steamy and easy to picture while you read. I will say it was a little slow to start with the character development but soon started going really fast and I was in enthralled. If you want to know what happens when a woman is stuck in between two Dominant men who are willing to give up everything to win her heart....I guess you will have to buy the book and see."}, {"userName": "Ruthie Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27449444-ruthie-taylor", "userReview": "I need a Red in my life - probably most women do!

Their relationship is that of best friends with benefits, nothing more, since Bond also likes to sleep with other women. When someone unexpected shows serious interest in Jaqs Bond finally decides that he wants a serious relationship with her. When the man Jaqs loves proposes a unique arrangement Jaqs must choose what her heart and body want most. Bond is a seriously sexy player, the guy you lust after that will never keep himself to one woman. At least that's the feeling you get until you learn his tragic back story. Aidan, the third in this love triangle, hid his affection for Jaqs for years and can't do so anymore after seeing all the hurt Bond has caused.

It\u2019s more like an homage to an author you really ought to follow.Since releasing my erotica series, I\u2019ve paid more attention to the works of my fellow authors. It\u2019s a ballooning sorority / fraternity, with hundreds, perhaps thousands of active authors releasing everything from 3,000 to 150,000 word erotic escapades. Every kink, fetish, and sub-genre under the sun is represented. Different tastes, different books.I\u2019m not normally into the tattooed, ear-pierced bad-boy genre. I generally don\u2019t drool and go weak in the knees over a man with small-gauge ear piercings and a tattoo spread across his back. I like my men suited and shaved, successful in a Wall Street kind of way.So when I picked up an advance copy of Blakely Bennett\u2019s new novel, \u201cStuck In Between,\u201d the first installment in her new \u201cBound by Your Love\u201d series, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I knew from the very first pages I was reading a story set in an unfamiliar world, with characters I might not recognize from daily life.What I encountered was some of the most beautiful writing I\u2019ve read in erotica or any genre. Concise. Crisp. Flowing. It moved effortlessly from scene to scene and evoked a vivid mindscape without burdening me with bloated prose. Ms. Bennett has a way of weaving dialogue that brings back-story to the fore without feeling heavily expository. You find yourself immediately parachuted into a close-knit tapestry of friends and lovers and you quickly feel as if you are in on the latest gossip. These people feel real, with real depth, and each has rich emotional ties to the main characters.\u201cStuck in Between\u201d had me hooked within pages and kept me flying along. Perhaps the telling trait of this book is that it practically begs you to carve out a Saturday and read it beginning to end. The plot is straightforward, but the game of emotional cat and mouse between the three main characters is fraught with volleyed, troubled hearts and heated, sexually-charged returns. Chapter after chapter, my affections and affinities teetered this way and that, first loathing one character, then fearing the other, only to find out that none were as flat or as simplistic as I had first anticipated.This is not the kind of writing you might anticipate from the \u201cIndie\u201d world, where we occasionally run into sloppy prose, with piecemeal thoughts and relationships plucked from the scrap heap of \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d erotica. Ms. Bennett expects more of her readers, that they will put their hearts into the journey along with her characters. Her writing style is mature and evolved, and would fit right in with mainstream works from the major publishing houses\u2026If it were not for the fact that this is, after all, erotica.Ms. Bennett\u2019s flair for the first-person erotic is as effortless and as visceral as any I have read. At the risk of sounding like an over-sexed cougar \u2013 which I am \u2013 I found it impossible to read her work without experiencing the desired effect. If the quality of erotica were ranked by the shade of the blush on my cheeks, my scoring of Ms. Bennett\u2019s sex scenes would be the most brilliant crimson. I am still reliving the images of the main characters as they moved from the mundane activities of daily life \u2013 eating, sleeping, working, bathing \u2013 into the heady pursuits of three lovers engaged in a partner-swapping waltz. This is more than a simple, \u201cTab P into Slot V\u201d smut novel. You feel the tingling effects in your saturated core.I cannot say whether the setting or plot of \u201cStuck in Between\u201d will resonate for everyone. This isn\u2019t my normal fare. I usually go for stories set in and around certain professions. Advertising. Medicine. Law. My own series is a topsy-turvy take on the \u201cBillionaire\u201d erotica sub-genre, so to each her own. Only the reader will know whether the multi-dimensionality of this band of familiar friends will be to their taste or not.What I can say is that I see enormous potential in this series and this gifted author. I feel as if I\u2019ve been blessed to read the work of a woman who\u2019s words are deeply affecting. I\u2019m hooked."}, {"userName": "Tami czenkus", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14898400-tami-czenkus", "userReview": "OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!

There is a lot of damage but LOVE proves once again stronger than the demons these friends carry. This is going to be a phenomenal series and i can't wait to hear more about the gang!!!! I have to give props to Lainie, Stay and Samantha (Jaqs sister) i couldn't get over the support and love shown from especially these three.

Red and Bond both want Jacqs. They both want to \"date\" her and come to a compromise, they both will. Friendships get tested, love gets questioned, and lots of hot sex makes this book one you must read.\"Your wearing underwear today?\" he groaned. \"My undergarments seem to be of great concern for you,\" I said, squirming from his touch.\"Spread your legs.\" When I hesitated, he said Now.\"....\"Stop trying to cover up that body, or I am going to have to tie these wrists up. And I don't wanna do that, because I wanna feel your nails digging into my ass when I finally plunge my cock inside of that delicious little pussy.\"...While Jacqs character is very indecisive over Bond and Red, she ultimately gets her way, and let me tell you, I like her way. With out giving too much away, let me tell you the last few chapters are my favorite. The author did a great job with description with out making in lewd.

If you believe that sex should only be in the classic missionary style, this book will be too racy for you. But if you like the sex scenes to be steamy and unambiguous, you should start reading Stuck in Between immediately.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book\u2026I was flipping the pages at a frantic pace to figure out what happens to the cast of characters. The sex scenes are hot and the complex relationships within this group of friends are intoxicating. During some of the more explicit sexual descriptions, I felt like a voyeur peeking through the blinds into the house! I also found myself pondering the relationship between the main characters. I don\u2019t think I could come to the same resolution, but I certainly enjoyed reading about Jacqs\u2019 considerations of her dilemma. Author Blakely Bennett does an excellent job of character development and keeps her reader engaged by expertly weaving this complicated tale. I am looking forward to the next installment, as further books about this group of friends are planned in the series."}, {"userName": "Nicole Huffman ~ Author Groupies", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13440239-nicole-huffman-author-groupies", "userReview": "I received an ARC in return for an honest review.4.5 Groupie StarsWow. I don't know where to start. I loved this book! Seriously loved it. I would love to be stuck in between Red and Bond and having both men vie for my love. This book is definitely for a mature audience with an open mind. I'm going to leave out an spoilers because I want you to discover this story for yourself.Jacqs is the main character and she is in love with Bond, however Bond is not a one woman man. He has some issues with his past that affect the way he is now. Red has had a feelings for Jacqs for awhile and is finally read to show her. His true feeling towards her. Who will Jacqs end up with? What happens when you love two different men?I liked both Bond and Red they each had qualities that complemented Jacqs. I loved how straightforward and blunt Red is. Some of the things that came out of his I thought I can't believe he actually said that. When you find out what happened in Bonds past to make him the man he is, you really feel for him and begin to understand him more, This book is filled with lots of HOT sex. Some of the best and detailed sex scenes I have read. This author knows how to write with them with just enough description and makes them easy to visualize. Sometimes I read a sex scene and I have trouble figuring out how some of the moves are possible or figuring our what is actually going on, that was NOT the case with this book.This is my first book by Blakely Bennett and now I am hooked. I just went and added her books to my TBR list. I also plan to stalk her pages for teasers and release dates of the next books in the series. I need Lainie's story and Stays story or possibly their story together (hint hint I hope they end up together). I would highly recommend this book you love a book with fun characters, hot sex, and an interesting love story."}, {"userName": "Mark Holborn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18272412-mark-holborn", "userReview": "true to the genre, a fantastic story of love and torment of the heart.

This fabulous tale offers not only one but two amazing alpha males for your consumption. Meet Jacqs, her heart caught up with her best friend (Bond), who is so troubled (and harbouring a secret) there's no way he could know what he wants or needs. Enter Red, Bond's best friend, and definitely not a Jacqs fan - or at least that's what she thinks. The sex is steamy and the tug that Jacqs finds herself in had me rooting for one alpha over another. Although I didn't always understand why she made the choices that she does, I realise that you can only follow your heart, even if that leads to the unconventional. It's a quick and easy read that draws you in. 4 stars from me....maybe we'll get Lainie's story next?"}, {"userName": "Michelle Marshall", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26456313-michelle-marshall", "userReview": "Well firstly a huge thank you to Blakely for letting me have the ARC copy of this book to indulge myself in. A huge well done to the author on another rivetting read.I simply could not put the book down once I started. I wanted to keep the pages turning to see how the story was going to pan out with the characters. I was intrigued from the beginning as to the path the story was going to take , needless to say I wasnt disappointed. A very hot read and not for any prudes to cast their eyes on! The bit I liked most about the whole book is the characters are not young things mainly already in their 30s , gives us aherm over 21s a bit of hope.

Jacqs can tell you all about it. Jacqs is an off again and on again fuck buddy of Bond. They have been best friends for a very long time. The problem is that Bond is a terrible flirt and he's into poly. Jacqs on the other hand prefers to be in a monogamy and each time Bond goes off, it kills her a little bit more. She becomes a bit more insecure and a bit more crazy. What woman wouldn't? If the man who matches you in so many ways constantly fucks other women, how can this not make a woman feel as if she isn't enough? Jacqs, cut your losses and move on.Ms. Bennett is an author who excels with dysfunctional relationships and alpha males being assholes. This story does not disappoint with a selfish messed up\u00a0man-boy. Bond is a rich boy who is the black sheep in the family. His family is appallingly vain and cruel. This still isn't what makes Bond the way he is. This big secret of his, is what makes him such a terrible boyfriend material. When the big truth is revealed, I blinked. Sure the incident is both tragic and traumatic. What it does show is how Bond is really still a little boy in a man's body. He is emotionally stunted and immature. It matters not that he's an exceptional sexual partner. He is no lover. He can't love. He only likes to own and show off his possession. He also never learned that once he breaks a toy, the toy may not want to be around him anymore. Jacqs was his toy and the last time he broke her heart, it was the last straw.When the status of relationship is set to \"it's complicated\", a picture diagram of Bond, Jacqs, Red and their group of friends should be depicted. This budding romance between Red and Jacqs can barely take off because of Bond and a few other friends. This is frustrating because Ms. Bennett captures the ties and complexity of friendship so well in this love entanglement. The fact that Bond still insists Jacqs is his when he callously threw her away each time he finished using her is just appalling. From a character development standpoint, Ms. Bennett excels. Each character is different, memorable and some of them oh so vile. There are many times I wanted to smack some sense into Bond. How can his friends be so faithful to him when he is so faithless? I don't understand how he can command such loyalty. The three main characters in this book are well crafted with multiple layers. It's easy to hate them at times and yet still feel sorry for them. None of these characters are black and white. There are reasons behind their madness, whether or not these reasons are acceptable is a different story.The main theme of this story is about relationships. There are many ways relationships work and no matter how it works, it comes down to a few truisms. There must be trust, chemistry and being on the same page. If the people in the relationship are not on the same page, chemistry alone won't save it. It also seems as if a successful relationship requires a ton of work. This is ever so evident with how Red and Jacqs finally overcome their obstacles of ex-lovers and questionable friends. It's really a train wreck waiting to happen. I'm hooked and I can't wait to see what happens next. This is a lovely start to a new series. This book is recommended to erotic readers who enjoy messy complicated love.*I received this book as a review copy in return for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Carol (StarAngel's Reviews) Allen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6294320-carol-starangel-s-reviews-allen", "userReview": "Book \u2013 Stuck in Between (Bound by Your Love)Author \u2013 Blakely BennettPublication Date \u2013 March 24, 2014Type \u2013 Stand-Alone SeriesGenre \u2013 Romance/EroticaRating \u2013 4 out of 5 StarsComplimentary copy kindly provided by author (Blog Tour) in exchange for an honest review.ReviewHOLY SHIT\u2026.the sex scenes are un-freakin-believable in this little gem of a book!

The story fell so freaking flat for me. It could have been soooo much better. Jacqs has been been hooking up with her bff Bond on and off for the past 8 years. While he screws everything with a vagina, she hangs back in the wings getting her kicks when she can with him. She wants to be with him, but she's realized that he'll never be a one woman man. Bonds BFF Red (aka Aiden)finally out of the blue, shows his cards to Jacqs. He wants her. He's wanted her for a long time. But Bond and Jacqs are so hit and miss, he didn't know when to make his move. Finally he does.But Bond wont take this news well, and he wont give up Jacqs to his best mate. Jacqs has a connection with Red that surprises her. He wants a commitment, and he wants one with her. But after all these years of being around \"Red\", she didnt even know his actual first name Aiden or that he had a twin sister with the shitty name of Aideen. *rolls eyes*.So anyways, the story turned cheesy as fuck. Red and Jacqs went straight into a relationship. Bond wasn't having it. He professes his love for her and wants to be a changed man for her. Red is open to Bond and Jacqs being together, even though he's in a relationship with Jacqs. Let the bed sharing begin!!!This was definitely a story of 3 people having their cake and eating it too. I liked the hotness of the book, but the storyline turned too cheesy for me to really enjoy.

It\u2019s wild, it\u2019s sexy, it\u2019s complicated and with two alpha males fighting over a woman?! This story\u2019s fate has been sealed in my book from the get-go. I did not expect to like either Bond or Red at all. And Jacqs?! At times, I wanted to grab her by the throat and shake her just to knock some sense into her! But nevertheless, I fell in love with all of them by the end! I thought this would be just one steamy read but it was a pleasant surprise to find out that it did not just deal with the sex and romance between the main characters. What I love most about this book is that it also showed the dynamics of family and great friendship. It took me for a roller-coaster ride not knowing which way the story is going to go. A reader might think that this book\u2019s theme is as predictable as the cover or the title might imply. But nope, that reader would be wrong! I thought I already know what\u2019s going to happen and then boom! I was blind-sided by something utterly unexpected. As I was reaching the end of the book, I was craving for more. I felt like I wanted a more definite resolution to the \u201cconflict\u201d. However that alone did not deter me for giving this book a 5-star rating if only because at some point, I realized that there is actually more to this book than just some romance novel that betrays a lack of original thought.
