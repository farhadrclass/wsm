I loved reading it. The majority of this book was relational, especially between mothers and daughters. It was not a romance book, as many of her stories are. Robin writes so well. Admittedly, her style is not for everyone. She doesn't write fast-paced adventurous stories. Instead, she writes leisurely stories that focus on and celebrate the seemingly \"simple\" aspects of life. That's something I really admire about her. She makes everything seem enchanting. If people are looking for a book that has a really intriguing plot, lots of action, and hugely dramatic moments, I wouldn't recommend Robin. However, if people desire a simple story that's told in a gentle and charming way, I would recommend her. This book is exactly that. It's a story of a woman and her daughter as they travel across the United States. They learn and grow together, and then they learn about their family. Abby, the woman, finally forgives people who have hurt her, and decides to break the chains that held her family captive for a long while. I liked Grand Lady, although I probably would have also found her intimidating. This was a charming story, and I recommend it to any \"leisure\" readers out there."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1219253-amanda", "userReview": "If only I had the option to give zero stars. Trite, sentimental, predictable plot."}, {"userName": "JoAnn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3465778-joann", "userReview": "I was asked to read this book by some women at church. I hold Christian fiction to a higher standard.Unlike some people I was not pulled in by the first sentence, but by the mention at the end of the prologue that Grand Lady had said something to crush Hannah's spirit and that that was the day the storyteller, Abby, had found her story.The misunderstanding that crushed Hannah's spirit was such a ridiculous issue that I can only ascribe it to the fact that Hannah is in the throes of puberty. And that she has a very bad vocabulary for a 12 year old. The book makes a big deal about things that just don't seem that important to me. Abby is squeamish about blood and wants her children to wear shoes. Apparently, such bizarre attitudes can only be the result of childhood trauma.Then there is the writing: 'For a flicker of a second, I saw what Hannah saw. The late afternoon sun was pressing daylight out of the woods like a juicer pressing all the sweet juice from an orange and letting chunks of pulp glide through the filter. In the same way that the pulp makes the juice thick, the languid bits of woodland \"pulp\" that came floating through the light made the air thick and golden.'There's a metaphor that has been beaten to death and will never bother anyone again."}, {"userName": "Deborah Andreasen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1924844-deborah-andreasen", "userReview": "As I read this transforming tale of a mother and daughter's growing and changing relationship, I wanted to reach out and freeze my time with my own daughter. Abby is such a great mother, and Hannah is so wise. There was so much to live in this book. Highly recommended! Read it and take a journey across the country while you sit in your jammies."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872570-kim", "userReview": "I could relate to this one due to my relationship with my grandmother so that is why I rated this one as I did. I liked seeing how Abby slowly realizes that the memories we've built up in our minds about people and places often turn out to be very much glorified. I think that is a very natural response when we're trying to hold onto good memories and block out bad ones, and this book portrayed that well. I loved the fiery, independent attitude of the grandmother one minute with the apologetic, ladylike manner the next. To me, this is very much how grandmothers often are (they can get away with it), and we love and respect them for both sides. Some reviews are not that favorable of this book, and I think if you don't have an Abby/Grand Lady relationship with an older woman in your life, this book might be a disappointment. But, for me, it did remind me of the precious relationship I had so I really enjoyed it. I also appreciated the fact that the spiritual lessons being taught were there but not in your face the whole time. I am a very spiritual person, but I stay away from most Christian fiction because I find that genre often cheesy and not very deep. This one had a good mix of story with a spiritual insight about love and forgiveness so that you really didn't think about the fact that you were reading Christian fiction at all."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4371743-candace", "userReview": "This was an interesting read for me. I was buoyed by Gunn's Christy Miller and Sierra Jensen series in adolescent and teen years so to read something of hers that wasn't affiliated with those characters was odd at first. I feel like the description is a little misleading. I didn't feel that Grand Lady crushed Hannah's spirit, even though the incident ended really well and was what Abby was hoping for all along. I thought there was going to be a more revealing secret when Grand Lady was talking to Abby but I really enjoyed that the focus of the novel was the relationships between the women in the family and the need for healing. I really enjoyed how insightful Hannah was and the perception that is a reason for every fear, that it dates back to some hurt, whether we realize it or not. That recognizing and realizing that facilitates healing. That was awesome. I liked how the book ended as far as the relationship between Abby and her mom. I was hoping for a little more detail or dialogue about it but I appreciate what that little action signified for their relationship. It was a little annoying to see how much Abby wanted her daughter to connect with Grand Lady but denied her the connection with her grandmother because of the issues Abby had with her. That also came full circle. It took a little while but as I finished the book, I realized how much I came to really like and how good it is. And I also want to smell a gardenia now :-)"}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3725802-leah", "userReview": "Mother and daughter bonding story.Abby has the great opportunity to drive her brother's expensive SUV across the US from Washington to Georgia (his family's going on a business trip to Europe and when they get back to the States they want to drive up the east coast). She's excited for living in Hawaii has given her a bout of homesickness for the mainland and her Grand Lady. She brings along her 12 year old daughter, Hannah, so she can meet Grand Lady and have the experience Abby had when she was young. The mother-daughter journey turns into discovery, finding forgiveness, and family.You can't go home again. Abby learns this when she travels back to Louisiana and her favorite relative, her grandmother, Grand Lady. You can go home and it can still be great, but it's not going to be the same. That's something we have to learn from experience. What Abby holds dear to herself isn't always going to work for someone else. Her daughter is her daughter but she's not Abby. What Abby needs is not always what Hannah needs and what Hannah needs is not always what Abby needs.Lessons learned in this story are valuable. Memories are memories and family is family.

You listen to that story, Honeygirl, and your story will come find you.\"?Wonderful book that took me less than 24 hours to read and yet is taking me days to digest. I can't stop thinking about how mothers and daughters and their stories affect each other so deeply. Even our fears are born of some 'life event' that we may not even remember without the Lord's prompting. A story of the everyday happenings in a family that mark us...for better or for worse...yet, the other person may not even realize the impression left. Words spoken in haste that injure. Needs not met that leave long time wounds. And words of praise that give us confidence. Rarely do these take place at huge life events, but in the day in and day out of being a family.This has been my favorite book to date from Robin Jones Gunn. It may take up permanent residence on my bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Mindy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4291782-mindy", "userReview": "Abby's childhood summer in the south with Grand Lady was a blessing and a fairytale - one that she so wanted her daughter, Hannah, to experience. But the trip from Maui to Louisiana was expensive, and there was no way they could afford it. But she could dream and pray and wish. When her prayer is answered, Abby and Hannah take a trip of a lifetime - not just a road trip but a relationship journey. Not everything is as you remember from when you are little, and sometimes it can give you insight and help for the present.Gardenias for Breakfast is an inspirational walk through the family relationships between women - mother/daughter and grandmother/granddaughter - and how these two relationships affect each other. Through these relationships we can give amazing blessings to each other and inspire each other. This is a great read, full of things for women to ponder about their own relationships."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3059103-jennifer", "userReview": "I loved this book. ...\"Everybody has a story. You listen to that story, Honeygirl, and your story will come find you.\"? And so the book begins. A mother and daughter fly to the states from Hawaii and set off on a cross country drive to visit their \"Grand Lady\" in Louisana. The trip brings guardian angels, self awareness, realizations, and long kept secrets to life. Heart issues are dealt with and the bond between them is strengthened as a result of the trip. The book represents the strong bond that a family can hold and it made me reflect on my own family relationships. I felt as though I had experienced Lousiana through this book. It was as if I could feel the sultry summer air and smell the sweet gardenias in Grand Ladys yard. I had a really hard time putting this one down.

I always LOVED those books and remember waiting with baited breath for each one to be released.When she converted to writing adult novels, I was very excited and enjoyed several of the books she wrote. This one, however, was so slow and uninteresting. I forced myself to stick it out, which I generally don't do if I feel it's not worth the time. It also had a ton of grammatical errors that the editor failed to catch, which distracted me from the story even more.
