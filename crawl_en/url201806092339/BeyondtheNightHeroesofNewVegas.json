As it often is with first books in a series, there's a lot the author has to do to set up the story, but Joss Ware does a pretty fine job laying the groundwork for the Awakening Heroes series. And BTW, that is an excellent and appropriate name for the series, because the hero of this book turned out to be a real HERO in every sense of the word.Basically the story is this: It's June 6, 2010, and three friends who met and bonded on a humanitarian trip to Haiti five years ago are exploring a cave near Sedona, Arizona. The three friends are Dr. Elliot Drake, a 30 year old ER physician from Chicago; Wyatt, a 32 yr old firefighter/paramedic from Colorado; and Englishman Quent, a rich playboy and heir to his industrialist father's fortunes, with an avid interest in antiquities and dangerous adventures. Along with their local guides Lenny and 'Fence', the three are exploring the cave when all hell breaks loose. A cataclysmic earthquake-like event happens, complete with strange smells, sounds, and sizzling shocks of energy, sending boulders tumbling, the Earth shaking and splitting, and then...darkness. When the five of them come to, it's 50 years later, and not one of them has aged a day. And a few of them now have some extra 'powers'...The story picks up 6 months later, and we find out a few things. Lenny, one of the guides, dies from an infection that Elliot may have inadvertently given to him with his special 'power' that could also be a curse; Quent has special abilities that sometimes leave him terrified; there was another survivor from the cave disaster--a mysterious man named Simon. Most of the world as we know it is gone, swallowed up by the oceans. There are no modern conveniences anymore--no working telephones, cars, stores, roads, electricity, etc.--the world has reverted to something you'd see in the 1800s. There are few survivors from the original disaster (called the 'Change')--most of the inhabitants of the Earth are less than 50 years old. The world is now controlled by immortal-like, evil beings called \"Strangers\" whose agenda isn't totally clear, and who live on a sort of \"Lost-City-of Atlantis\" continent that sprung up in the Pacific Ocean. There are also zombie-like creatures (gangas) that come out at night, moaning \"Ruuuth...ruuuth\". And the men are trying to make their way to a settlement called 'Envy'...When the men stumble upon a group of teenagers being attacked by the gangas, they step in to help, and then a beautiful woman (Jade) on horseback rides in and saves the day. Elliot is instantly smitten by this brave, gorgeous woman--who is she? Does she live in Envy? Can she tell them what has happened and if there's any hope for civilization? Elliot is not even sure if he wants to live in this unfamiliar, terrifying new world, but God must have saved him for a reason. And with Jade's help, he just might discover the reason.Wow, this highly imaginative book was one thrill ride after another. There was a lot to tell and explain and keep track of, and I actually found myself taking notes just to keep everything straight. Lots of names and facts get tossed out right away so the reader has to be on his/her toes to determine who are the good guys, who are the bad guys, and figure out if this apocalypse was a man-made occurance, done by aliens, or something else? I loved the whole end-of-the-world scenario--it reminded me a little of my favorite Stephen King book (The Stand). I loved the whole scavenge-for-clothes and-things-you could use vibe. I loved when Elliot and his buddies finally made it to the walled city of 'Envy' (just wait until you discover where 'Envy' really is) and its communal way of living. I loved meeting the older man Lou Waxnicki--a computer geek from 2010 and one of the brains behind the new civilization. I loved seeing how the people of 2060 tried to adapt and live without the conveniences that we now have. Of course most of them didn't know what they were missing, so it was hardest for men like Elliot and his buddies (who all lost their families) to adapt.The fight between the good guys and the Strangers has just begun in this book, and no way is it over yet. There's at least two more books in the series, and the author has dropped some big hints about who is behind the destruction of the earth as we know it and why. This book just covers the tip of the iceberg of this post apocalyptic world, and it left me with lots of questions, and I must say I can hardly wait to read the next one in the series Embrace the Night Eternal.If there's one thing I felt was short changed a wee bit in this story, it was the romance. I understand how the romance could get lost in the shuffle in the first book, since there's so much to set up and explain for the whole series. I was just hoping to see a little bit more, because when Jade and Elliot finally got together (after 250 pages!), they sizzled. Of course Jade had some control issues due to a terrifying couple of years in her past, so she wasn't immediately ready for the attraction she felt for Elliot, or his sometimes possessive streak, but when they worked things out...whew! Elliot was one fine man--sexy, heroic, courageous...and was very deserving of a HEA (as was Jade), and I was satisfied with his character's journey. And Jade and Elliot's romance wasn't the only one brewing in this book--Quent had a very hot encounter with his future lady, and this one almost upstaged Elliot/Jade. We'll have to see if this encounter turns into something more in his book (Abandon the Night).So, for readers (both male and female) looking for a new, exciting, imaginative series with a touch of the paranormal, lots of action, little bits of horror (those gangas are scary!), and (hopefully way more) romance, you can't go wrong with the Awakening Heroes series. There's lots of questions left unanswered in this one, and I can't wait to uncover the answers. For me, I think this book might be even better with a second read, but as it stands now I'd have to rate it a very solid 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016128-shannon", "userReview": "4.5 Stars!I'm a big fan of Colleen Gleason and when I found out she was writing a new series under a new name, a post-apocalyptic zombie romance no less, I knew I had to read it as soon as it came out. I loved this book and I can't wait for the sequel, but there were a few things that bothered me and kept me from giving it the full five stars.A small group of men went hiking in Arizona and entered a cave, only to be caught in some sort of earthquake. When they emerged, the whole world had changed. Civilization as they knew it was gone and the world had become overgrown by nature. They come to find out that they had been asleep for 50 years, not aging, and everyone they knew was dead and gone. And at night, strange zombie-like creatures come out at night, moaning for Ruuutthh...This story revolves around the relationship of Dr. Elliot Drake, one of the men from the past, and Jade, a girl from the current world. The story is about them at its core, but there's so much more going on. They way the plot reveals itself bit by bit is fascinating and I was eating it up. Right off the bat you want to know why the world is the way it is, who Jade really is, why did the group of men survive and how did they not age? It's all pretty crazy at first but not to the point where it's overwhelming. The zombie-like creatures, the gangas, are scary and menacing and I was reminded of the video game Resident Evil while I was reading the fight scenes with them. I think this book would make a great video game, actually! There's romance, action, horror, science fiction, and suspense all rolled into this one book. I loved just about every minute of it.There were a few things that bothered me though. Having sex while a body is sitting in a bath tub in the next room over is not sexy. That really turned me off. Also, I'm kind of worried about who and what the villains are, I'm afraid it might end up being a little cheesy. When I first read about where their origins were from I cringed. But, that mystery wasn't wrapped up in this book so I'll have to wait for the next to see if I get some more answers. That aside, I enjoyed it a lot. I think it's crazy how Ware managed to meld so many different genres into one book, but I love her for it!"}, {"userName": "P.A.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was recommended by someone I trust so I knew I\u2019d like it, I just didn\u2019t expect to love it as much as I did. Why? First, because I have never read any Dystopian novels (well, not since the Chrysalids in High School) and the description just didn\u2019t appeal to me. That sounds terrible, but I\u2019m being honest. I would have never read this book based on the blurb. I only read it because it was a good friend I trust who recommended it\u2014thank you, T\u2019irla. Second, because of the nature of the story I expected a lot of world building\u2014and sometimes a lot of world building equals boring. I fully expected to have to \u201cget through\u201d book one in order to start enjoying the story by book two. Well, that was not the case in Beyond the Night.Joss Ware has a talent, that\u2019s for sure. She doesn\u2019t just dump a ton of information on the reader in the beginning to introduce her world. She also doesn\u2019t leave you hanging for information either. She has found the perfect balance of telling her story and building the picture she wants us to see, without boring the reader to death. Fantastic job Ms. Ware!The characters were all so unique and interesting; different personalities and different backgrounds all coming together in a new world and working together to rebuild. And I absolutely loved that our hero and heroine find love under the circumstances. I literally felt butterflies in my belly in parts\u2014and considering what was going on around them: amazing. There was also a lot of good tension. Romantic tension, suspenseful oh-my-god-are-they-going-to-get-out-of-this-alive-tension, and let\u2019s not forget sexual tension. Overall, I really recommend this book to everyone. I don\u2019t think you have to like paranormal or dystopian to enjoy this book. It\u2019s got a fantastic story line, good characters, a lot of suspense, and romance. What\u2019s not to like? I can\u2019t wait to get to book two."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2127955-holly", "userReview": "I was so excited to find a book combining so many unique elements that I love; post-apocalyptic mayhem, adventure, paranormal romance and zombies. How could it disappoint, right? Unfortunately, after a promising start, this book completely fell apart.For the first 75 pages, I was riveted to this story. It was only after the band of survivors made their way to the city of Envy (a barren version of Las Vegas) that things went south for me. The story became less a zombie ass-kicking adventure, and more a retread of cliched para-romance themes. I won't get into specifics, since I don't want to spoil the 'twists' for anyone who plans on reading this, but I will just say that I rolled my eyes several times. And I have the say the last third of this book worked on my patience, and there was a LOT of skimming. To be honest, I was very happy to see this novel come to an end, which is unfortunate considering how excited I was when I began this book. :("}, {"userName": "Mollie", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647089-mollie", "userReview": "So thankful to Kristie(J) and Nath for bringing this series to my attention. I've been getting into the post-apocalyptic/dystopian genre for awhile now. However, most of what I've read has been of the YA variety, aside from a few adult titles, like The Road by Cormac McCarthy. So I was uberexcited to hear that this series combined both post-apocalyptic AND romance.Part Resident Evil, part I Am Legend, throw in a little Atlantis conspiracy theory and add romance and you've got yourself the beginning of a fabulous new series! I really enjoyed this book, not necessarily for the romance but mostly for Ware's world building. As readers we're being introduced to this new version of our world after a catastrophic geological phenomena that remains a mystery. I'm really anxious to learn more about what, or who, caused this catastrophe that basically wiped out the planet. This bit of mystery and intrigue extends to both the Rip Van Winkle clan ( Why were they zonked out for 50 years? Why do they have new-found powers?) and to the Strangers (Who are they? Are they responsible for the apocalypse? What do they have planned next?) So many questions! I can't wait to find out the answers in the following books!I rarely find the first book in a series to be my favorite (the exception being Outlander by Diana Gabaldon), especially in sci-fi/fantsay/UF mostly because the first book is usually setting up the entire world for the reader. I usually find the romance to be a little lacking in the first of a series. This was the case with Beyond the Night. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the romance between Jade and Elliot but one of the reasons I love reading a series is because authors often give characters a story arc that span several books. Some readers don't like this. I love it. I feel like I'm invested in these characters and usually enjoy their stories the most. Unfortunately, I lacked this connection with Elliot and Jade. The sexy bits are hot but I'm more interested in find the answers to the above mentioned questions and learning more about Elliot's companions.All in all this book lived up to my expectations. I'm so glad there's a post-apocalyptic romance series! I can't wait to pick up the next book!The Envy Chronicles in order: 1. Beyond the Night 2. Embrace the Night Eternal 3.

It was interesting and captivating, with the crystals, the ragnas, and the strange powers Elliott and he four men that was with him in the cave suddenly has. And I really want to know more about how and why the destruction of the world happened. Especially as it seems it was man-made. Unfortunately the romance wasn\u2019t as good as I was hoping for. Mostly probably because of my issues with Jade. Jade just didn\u2019t work for me. I liked that she was strong and controlling, but I didn\u2019t like the fact that she used her looks and her body to get what she wanted. Especially not with her past, which was quite heartbreaking.  I did like Elliott, and the guys that survived with him.

Not by a\u00a0virus or natural disaster nor was it a war. An unknown group referred to as the \"Strangers\" appeared shortly after in small numbers and began taking over. These strangers are immortals wearing\u00a0odd crystals. Strange zombie-like\u00a0creatures known as Gangas roam the planet. These oversized monsters, appear at night and have razor sharp claws. They all moan the same message. \n   Our story begins fifty years later when Dr. Elliott Drake emerges from a cave\u00a0with friends to discover they have traveled in time and the world as they know it is gone. As an added twist Drake discovers he can heal with his touch. What unfolds is a dystopian, apocalyptic, zombie, paranormal romance mix up. \n   Beyond the Night offers suspense, horror, a little bit of mystery and even some heat.

Finally a new series I can sink my teeth into. It\u2019s feels like it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gotten hold of a really good series. I knew 1/3 of the way in I was going to read the entire Envy Chronicles. Beyond the Night is exactly what I needed to get over the ho hum \u2018too much romance not enough action\u2019 slump I have found myself in.There are usually three things I want in a story to make me happy. A good plot, good characters, and action/suspense that keeps me guessing. Beyond the Night has all three. I\u2019m not going into details because frankly, there are a lot of layers that need to be discovered as they happen. And that is what I loved about it. All those layers! As the first book in the series, yes there needs to be a lot of ground work detailing which for some folks may be tedious and boring. Me, I live for it. I like all the background build up, the attention to detail but still there is a lot to discover as the series unfolds. To top it off there\u2019s a whole lot of action and suspense that keeps the story moving fast and me happy and guessing. There\u2019s quite a few characters to get to know. Mainly they revolve around five guys from the past. This story is Elliott\u2019s. His and Jade\u2019s that is. Two strong characters that I instantly liked. Jade was great and yet a little quirky with her always needing to be in control but it was Elliott that really held my fascination. His \u2018gift\u2019, oh boy. Ironic considering he is/was a doctor. How he learns to deal with it was yikesy and exciting to me although there is a moment with a crystal that had me head scratching. The heat between them was at the right temperature without pushing this post-apocalyptic romance into the tacky trashy realm. There\u2019s also a whole slew of secondary character. Thankfully all the other characters are not just drive-by fillers instead they add substance to the storyline that had me begging to know they story as well. I friend has suggested this series was right up my alley and that I would enjoy it. Yup, loved it. Already started telling my book buds this one is a keeper and they need to read it. Beyond the Night by Joss Ware is the perfect read for anyone looking to try out a post-apocalyptic/dystopian romance.

There's no better way to relax at the end of the day than with a good romance book. If you combine romance with science fiction, it's even better! Beyond the Night is a paranormal romance that takes place in Earth's future. A group of men are spelunking in a cave in Arizona when they feel an earthquake hit. When they wake up, the world has changed. Cities are in ruin. It's clear to them that something catastrophic has happened. There are dangerous monsters that resemble zombies running around attacking people and there's a race of mysterious, evil immortals threatening the few humans that are left in this world.Not only has some apocolptic event happened to them while they were asleep, but they appear to have woken up 50 years later and have not aged a single day in all that time. They are each endowed with a different special power too! The men meet up with the inhabitants of Envy (what used to be Las Vegas) and sparks fly when Elliot meets Jade, a strong beautiful woman dedicated to defeating the evil in Envy. They have to find out how to survive in this new world where everything is different and dangerous.With the increased interest in end of the world and 2012 stories, this book really hits the spot. It's a refreshing change from the Vampire/Werewolf paranormal romances that seem to be all the rage right now in the romance world. The romance scenes are hot and heavy and the action is non stop as the characters fend off danger and learn their way around their new home.This is Joss Ware's first novel in the new paranormal romance series, The Envy Chronicles, that was published in January 2010.

They live in a community of survivors in Envy, Nevada. At the time of the change, six guys were in a cave in Arizona and knocked unconscious. They wake up fifty years later, without aging. Two of them have abilities that they didn\u2019t have before. Elliott\u2019s new ability is to sense illness within a body similar to an MRI. He can also take illness from another through touch. Then when he touches a different person, the illness passes to them.Every night zombie-like creatures called gangas come out looking for humans and tearing them apart. Strangers appear to be humans and control the gangas. A Stranger has a crystal under his skin on his chest. Strangers appear to be immortal since they don\u2019t age, and humans can\u2019t figure out how to kill them. Preston is a Stranger who kept Jade prisoner for three years. He beat and raped her. Somehow she escaped and has been in hiding from Preston and helping Lou and Theo with their resistance movements. Jade was born after \u201cThe Change\u201d and is now in her late twenties. Elliott\u2019s group meets Jade during a ganga fight. She takes them back to Envy with her. Elliott is drawn to Jade from the moment he sees her. He sees her flirting with other men, which bothers him. Elliott accompanies Jade on some resistance missions.REVIEWER\u2019S OPINION:This was pretty good, but I would have liked more emotional development among the characters. This book is mostly action and events, and it\u2019s good for that reason alone. I kept thinking about \u201cThe Host\u201d by Stephenie Meyer, printed in 2008. I loved \u201cThe Host\u201d because of the warm and amazing emotional connection and development among the characters, which wasn\u2019t as strong in this book. Both books are about humans in the minority trying to stay alive while aliens rule the earth. Both books also have something implanted in humans, making them different. Crystals are implanted in this book, worm-like creatures are implanted in \u201cThe Host.\u201d This book was ok, but nothing made it stand out enough to make it a must read. There are at least two sequels coming which tell the stories of Simon and Quent.CAUTION SPOILERS:I had some unanswered questions. How did Ian know about Elliott\u2019s healing gift? It didn\u2019t make sense unless he or someone could read Elliott\u2019s mind. But then he apparently didn\u2019t know that Elliott could transfer the illness to another. Was this a partial mind read? Other questions: Why did they put the crystal into Allie, and why didn\u2019t it work? Who was Allie to Ian? How did Ian know which door Elliott and Jade would be coming out of at the mall? Some things will probably be answered in future books, but it would have been nice to know a little more about the crystals, the Strangers, and why the gangas kill all humans except blonds. They kidnap blonds but we don\u2019t know where they take them or why. Apparently teens are kidnapped by Strangers to use as slaves. I wanted to know more, but not enough to buy sequels to get the answers.I was bothered that Elliott decided to commit suicide to save the life of the local mayor. I couldn\u2019t buy it \u2013 Lou or Theo maybe, but not losing a \u201chealer\u201d to save the live of a person who didn\u2019t seem to be doing anything special. In \u201cThe Host,\u201d the alien decides to die so her human host could live. That was a wonderful self sacrifice I could believe. But Elliott doing it in this book didn\u2019t work for me. I didn\u2019t intend to write so much about \u201cThe Host,\u201d but too many comparisons kept coming to mind as I read this book.DATA:Story length: 357 pages.

Recently I found another series thanks to Melliane at Between Dreams and Reality blog, and the author is Colleen Gleason, although she is writing as Joss Ware. Since I really enjoy this author\u2019s work, it was easy to slip right into a different genre by her.Most of the world died in 2010 and nobody is really sure why-extreme weather events, earthquakes, and people simply dropping dead for no reason. Since then, a group of people known as Strangers have now inhabited the earth in small numbers. They have a crystal embedded near their clavicle and are immortal. Also new to the earth are a huge zombie type creature that are called gangas, that only come out at night.When Elliott Drake and some friends wake up in a cave fifty years later, looking just as they did in 2010, it\u2019s a shock to them all. They\u2019ve lost everything and everyone they knew and a couple of them have new found abilities-Elliott in particular. He\u2019s a doctor and now he is able to heal. Healing is not without a price however, and Elliott pays the biggest amount. He and his friends have been trying to get to the town of Envy for six months, since they have been told by other survivors about the large group of people that live there. When they come across a group of teenagers that have been attacked by gangas, they fight to save the group. Jade, a beauty riding a wild mustang, enters the fray as well and Elliott is smitten.This series is billed as dystopian romance and that\u2019s pretty much exactly what you get. However, I was pleasantly(?) surprised at the amount of intrigue, mystery, action, and violence that is involved as well. The book also introduces us to other females that you pretty much know are going to have their own books, with none other than Elliott\u2019s other friends from 2010-of course I could be wrong, but there\u2019s a pretty perfect set up here for that to happen.My only problem with this book concerns Jade. She is in hiding due to being sought after by one of the villains. However, she sings in one of the few bars in Envy. I still can\u2019t understand how she is in hiding and does that. It bothered me so I felt I needed to mention it. However, it wasn\u2019t that big of a thing when taking the book as a whole.I thought the pacing was excellent and as usual with this author\u2019s work, the writing was well done. I really liked the characters that are introduced, and even the villains are well done-and particularly evil. To be honest, I am busy reading other books that I have to read, when all I want to do is dive back into this world and read the next one in this series, because I have had a bit of a book hangover since finishing this one. Recommended to any adult paranormal romance fans, or even urban fantasy readers that enjoy an exciting ride of a story."}, {"userName": "Christi Snow", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/715656-christi-snow", "userReview": "My Review:OMG, I am so excited about this series. This was a phenomenal first book to get it all going. This is a post-apocalyptic world created by Joss Ware and it is brilliant!Elliott and 5 others were hiking in a cave near Sedona when the apocalypse happened. Something about where they were hiking caused them to sleep through the next 50 years. When they woke up, it was 50 years after the world fell to ruin, but they hadn't aged a day and even had new powers that they are still discovering. They awoke to a world in ruin where very few people have survived. Civilization has fallen and gangas (zombie-like creatures) rule the night. The book starts 6 months after this group has awakened and they are trying to find their way to Envy...the largest known civilization left in the Western half of the country. Envy turns out to be what's left of Las Vegas, now called New Vegas, or N.V. = Envy. A day out from arriving at Envy, they run into a group of teenagers being attacked by gangas and Jade, who is on horseback trying to save them. Elliott is immediately in lust with Jade (it's been 50+ years since the guy got laid.) He also quickly discovers that there is a nasty little twist to his new-found power of healing.I LOVED Elliott. He was a doctor before the change and he still has that heart of caring...for everyone. He is devastated and still trying to absorb all that has happened within the last 50 years. PTSD, sleep deprivation, fury, nightmares, and overwhelming sadness are just some of the daily problems that he is dealing within his psyche. It's a strange new world and he has no idea how he and his friends fit into it anymore when everything that they knew and loved is suddenly gone. He feels an incredible pull to Jade, but doesn't want to give into that as he misunderstands how she fits into this world and the men around her.Jade is a survivor. She survived 3 years as a prisoner and slave to the Strangers before she escaped. Rape, beatings, torture were just the tip of the horrors that she had to survive and she is still on the run from them. But that does not keep her from playing in her part in an uprising that is brewing against the Survivors being led by Lou and his brother Theo, two computer geniuses that were alive when the apocalypse happened and doing all in their power to take back their world.This is a powerful book with a fantastic group of characters. I think that this is definitely going to be a keeper series for my closet if this first book is anything to judge it by. I am so excited to move onto book #2!!!"}, {"userName": "Lover of Romance", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3709091-lover-of-romance", "userReview": "Dr. Elliot Drake wakes up, not knowing what has fully happened, but realizes he has somehow, with his friends, have been put in some sort of stasis for fifty years. He finds that the world that he has known, has been destroyed. Only hundreds of humans are left alive, now those who are called \"Strangers\" control the world and are immortal, he knows that there is definitely not the world he wants to be in, but tries to make the best of current circumstances. Having been a doctor before all this had occurred, he finds out he has special gifts of healing, that allows him to save a young woman's life, that stirs up every one of his senses. Jade, after the destruction, and being held captive for three years by the \"strangers\", is out for revenge on those who have captured her and many innocents. Then after being healed after a brutal attack, she finds herself drawn to Elliot, whom she feels she can trust, but her minds tells her its crazy to trust someone that is a total stranger to her. But things starts to heat up, both between them intimately and in the world that will both put them in danger, but will find how strong they are together as a team.As this is the first of this series, and the first that I have read this series, I truly loved this story. Its not everyday I read a plot like this one. It has the whole end of the world aspect, and a true evil to be fought, and how finding love can strengthen. It also had some aspects that left me feeling like I was on the edge of a cliff, very thrilling for sure. We have Elliot, whom has no idea what has truly happened, except to him and his friend everything has been destroyed, their lives and families are gone. They are just learning to survive. Then he meets Jade, who is unlike any other woman he has met. She is beautiful yet strong and capable and just as good of a fighter as he is. Even though the odds are definitely against them, they seem to come out on top, and together, and if you love a good intense romance this one is for you. Its plot is filled with thick suspense, intense passion, and a tender love that will stir you up and leaving you aching for more. There wasn't really anything that I could pin point that I disliked, it was a great story, but it seemed to have the lower end of romance that I am used to but other than that it was fantastic! I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series, and to find out what happens next!"}, {"userName": "Mello \u2763 Illium \u272eHarry\u272e \u2600Myrnin\u2600 Torin Ichimaru", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6981505-mello-illium-harry-myrnin-torin-ichimaru", "userReview": "[Elliott healed Mayor Rogan and went off to his room to die alone (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jill Dunlop", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3348876-jill-dunlop", "userReview": "Beyond the Night is the first book in a new series by Joss Ware. It takes place in a post apocalyptic world when six men find that they have been asleep for 50 years in a cave. They went to an expedition, major environmental destruction happened ending the world as they knew it and they woke up not having aged at all but the world was completely different. It is only safe for them to travel during the day because at night these zombie-like creatures come out to feast. Elliott Drake meets a mysterious woman, Jade who draws his curiosity. She is able to introduce Elliott and his friends into the small society that formed after the big disaster. Elliott must find a place for himself in this new world.I really like the set up for this new series. I don't often get a chance to read books with a more sci-fi aspect to them, but I do enjoy them. I find the whole mystery to the world disaster very interesting. The world building is great and the reader can easily see the author has interesting plans for revealing the whole story. Readers get a taste with this first book but there is a lot more to be discovered as to what exactly is going on and how things came to be.It's funny because most of the time I am more interested in reading about the romance between the two characters than the world building. Oddly enough, that wasn't the case with this book. It was the other way around this time. While I liked Jade and Elliott, I felt almost as if the romance was forced on me. There was a lot of internal dialogue that told me of their attraction for one another but I didn't necessarily see it. I think Elliott is a really great hero for Jade. He gives her the space she needs. Jade has a lot of hang-ups caused from past relationships. She has a lot of baggage and Elliott lets Jade know he is interested without being pushy. Fans of Beta heroes will really like Elliott."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2621652-amanda", "userReview": "Dr. Elliott Drake is not at all comfortable in the world. It could be the ganga - zombie-like creatures who roam the night. Or it could be because of the fifty years that lapsed between when his group entered and exited that cave, the fifty years he has no memory of and that apparently did not age him. Civilization collapsing while he was \"away\" didn't really help, either. When he and his friends rescue a group of stupid kids who got stuck outside at night, he meets Jade. She is gone before morning, and Elliott figures he'll never see her again. But when she shows up in Envy after they've dropped the kids home and earned themselves a place to stay, Elliott is intrigued. She may have the answers they've been seeking.This is such a fantastic book. I've really been getting into dystopian / post-apocalyptic literature of late, and Beyond the Night is a perfect example of how to write in this genre. Elliott and Jade are compelling characters, but there is also significant work put into the supporting characters, lending the story an extra sense of depth. While it's still a mystery how civilization came to such an abrupt end, the reader gets the sense that it might be solved in later books.

Not because of all the prestige that comes with their profession but because they are usually portrayed as really caring men who want to make a difference in the world. So obviously I loved Elliot and Jade was a good woman for him. They fell in love very quickly but hey, this was a post apocalyptic romance so there's really not a lot of time to waste. The bad part of this book was said post apocalyptic setting which was so complicated that I kept rolling my eyes every few seconds: Atlantis! Paranormal powers! Immortal men with crystals! I really didn't know where this was going and the more I found out, the more I groaned.Sebastian Fields really rocked the narration. I'll be sure to look for more books narrated by him (not this series though.)The only good things I'm taking away from this book are a new narrator I enjoyed and that I should read more books with doctors as heroes.
