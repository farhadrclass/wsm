This woman gave the whole new meaning to erotic romance genre. Unlike lot of books in this category, main focus is on the story behind the sex - don't get me wrong, this woman knows how to write hot scenes that will leave you panting. Her books could be good example for difference between pornography and erotica in literature - first is purely graphical with the sole purpose to quickly satisfy one of the our primal urges, and second is more subtle and writers have more serious approach to the subject (although, it can be quite graphic as well). The Space Between Us is story about menage and bisexuality. Okay, hold your panties! It's not that kind of story. Menage in this novel isn't author's secret fantasy put on the paper as the attempt to live it at least on that way. No, Megan Hart tries to go deeper and figure out what is beyond someones sexual fantasies or choices. You have two storylines in the novel - one is Tesla's present and the other is her past. Those two things aren't separate - everything that she went through defines who she is now, from her past relationships, childhood to the way her parents lived. Other two characters, Meredith and Charlie, are well written. I had the feeling that two of them were actually different aspects of Tesla's personalty - she has this inner struggle going on through the whole book. You'll have to read it to see how it ends. Other thing that I really liked was that three-way relationship wasn't pictured with big pink glasses or alpha males with no problem to share one woman. I've read Sharing Hailey by Samantha Ann King few weeks after The Space Between Us and that is big-pink-glasses menage. I love that book, it's even on my favorite shelf - every girl needs a fantasy like that from time to time, but here you have real life story without all super strong men part. Megan Hart tries to stay realistic even when she writes about taboo themes and that is why I like her. Her books would be great choice for all of those who like their reading with extra spice, but still down to earth. ***NOTE!

I think she may be \u2013 she\u2019s busy heaping more misery on miserable people with miserable lives. I do quite like it though \u2013 I really enjoy some angst in the books I read and I especially like the characters to suffer and suffer they truly do.We have Tesla coasting along in life working as a barista. She doesn\u2019t appear to have any ambitions and is happy just to keep bumping along the way she is. This makes her sound humdrum but she is anything but \u2013 she definitely marches to an entirely different beat than everybody else. She\u2019s had a highly unconventional childhood being raised by two hippies spending long summers in communes and has a totally different perspective on sex than the rest of us. She\u2019s uninhibited and totally unrestricted by the mores of society.She is heteroflexible and, at the beginning of the novel, she is crushing on one of her customers at the coffee shop, Meredith. Meredith comes in almost daily and seems to charm all the staff and customers into giving up their most intimate secrets. Everyone has a story to tell, she says and she collects them with relish. She and Tesla get to know each other better until one day Meredith asks her to fuck her husband so she can watch and Tesla agrees to meet him, to see if it would work and so they begin their m\u00e9nage relationship \u2013 just the three of them!Meredith \u2013 how I hated her. She\u2019s a social butterfly, flitting from her latest interest to the next, bored quickly by everyone and everything, totally capricious and a complete BIATCH!! She\u2019s like an F5 tornado, tearing through everyone, destroying everything she touches and leaving a trail of devastation in her wake and she can scarcely manage a backward glance.Tesla, on the other hand, I loved. She\u2019s a little different from most heroines, is unapologetic for who she is but is capable of deep love for those around her. Charlie, Meredith\u2019s husband, I loved too and felt very sorry for him. I feel that he\u2019s been blinded by Meredith for a long time and will do anything to appease her, including fucking another woman in front of her. I was just waiting for the scales to fall from his eyes.There\u2019s also a whole bunch of supporting characters whose lives are fairly miserable \u2013 they have ongoing issues that are not resolved in this story. They just appear to add to the general air of misery that pervades this book. But, I\u2019m selling it short. Yes, there\u2019s not a lot of joy here but it does kinda get under your skin, take root and flourish \u2013 I thought about this book a lot when I was away from it, wondering where it would go.I\u2019m undecided how to describe the ending \u2013 not conventionally happy, for sure, and it\u2019s certainly doesn't end in a neat little package all tied up in a bow but it\u2019s a progression from how the book begins so it satisfies me. It\u2019s refreshingly different from a lot of erotic fiction and deeply thoughtful. Yes, I enjoyed this.4 stars thoughtful erotic fictionARC courtesy of Harlequin via NetGalleyFor more of my reviews, please visit my Sinfully Sexy Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Mandi Schreiner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2704703-mandi-schreiner", "userReview": "I think Megan Hart is an excellent erotic story teller. I have read Broken, Dirty, Tempted and Stranger and pretty much loved each book. She challenges me as a reader and makes me stretch my boundaries. Her endings are rocky HEA\u2019s at best (although that is one of the things I love about her books), and the ending of The Space Between Us to me is very sad. The prologue of the book is actually the end (we go back a few months in chapter one.) The final ending does have another small chapter, but you pretty much know in the prologue how things will end up. And it made me nervous. There are kind of three storylines that take place. I\u2019ll go into each one.Tesla works at a coffee shop. She is bisexual, having had relationships with both men and women. As she states, \u201cI\u2019m not a straight girl. I\u2019m not a queer girl, either. I guess you could say I\u2019m sexually fluid.\u201d Growing up, she spent her summers in a compound with her parents and her brother Cap. She was encouraged to try new things, and she knew that her parents with all the other adults, shared each other\u2019s bed at this compound. It was here she met Vic, who worked on cars. He is five years older than she is and Tesla crushed on him. Things exploded one night and they shared a physical release. While nothing comes of this permanently, later in life when Tesla\u2019s parents both pack up and leave, leaving her (at 17) and her 14 year old brother with no options, they both move in with Vic and his wife Elaine. I really enjoyed the Vic storyline. Both the brief flashbacks to their relationship on the compound to her time spent living with him now. She doesn\u2019t live with him because she is a slacker, more because I think she clings to him as family. There isn\u2019t really a weirdness between them because they shared a sexual moment (maybe a tiny hint of weirdness) and Tesla truly loves and respects his wife and their kids. I think she feels sad that she lives in someone else\u2019s basement and has a shitty boss and maybe a little lost in life. So when Meredith comes into her life, the decision to be with her and her husband might have been an easy one.Meredith is a force of nature in Tesla\u2019s eyes. Outgoing, a little crazy, and everyone is drawn to her. Tesla crushes on her hard. Meredith visits the coffee shop often, and a friendship of sorts develops. Meredith always wants Tesla to tell her crazy stories about herself, and one day asks Meredith if she will sleep with her husband. Since Tesla has feelings for Meredith, she says yes, more to be with her than with her husband Charlie.Charlie is apparently cool with all of this, they meet and eventually the three of them end up in bed. At first Charlie and Tesla interact, as well as Charlie and Meredith. For as wild as Meredith seemed (or claimed) she really isn\u2019t, and it takes a lot of prodding from Tesla to start a physical relationship with Meredith.Meredith is a hard character to figure out. She always felt very fake and I never took her sincerely. I didn\u2019t understand her relationship with Charlie. I believe they had been married eight years when Tesla enters their life, but I guess I just didn\u2019t feel chemistry between them. Of course you could argue they didn\u2019t have chemistry so that is why they were looking for another body in their bed. But I never connected with Charlie and Meredith\u2019s relationship.Along the same lines, I had a hard time with Charlie. He is very low key, not a big presence. At times I found my self kind of pitying him, as he has been stuck in this weird marriage with Meredith who definitely has the balls in the relationship. I guess also I\u2019m not used to this type of m\u00e9nage. In other stories, the husband and wife are so in love, but I just didn\u2019t feel that here. I just think this type of set-up is not my favorite. The third storyline takes us back to Tesla\u2019s high school years where she explores her sexuality with identical twin brothers. I have a rule that I don\u2019t like or will read brother m\u00e9nage, but I think the author does a nice job using this as an example of Tesla\u2019s past sexual experience. She even compares her relationship with the two brothers at one point to her relationship with Charlie and Meredith.By the end, I just felt unsatisfied. I like how Meredith reacts at the end, and what she says to Charlie and Tesla. It made send for her character. But I just didn\u2019t feel the love or chemistry between Charlie and Tesla and I think that is a key relationship I needed to believe in. I liked Tesla individually, and I was totally indifferent to Charlie.

Our narrator here is coffee shop employee Tesla, someone whose co-workers and customers think of as sexually adventurous, \"wild,\" a characterization which makes her somewhat uncomfortable. Although her background is unconventional and her sexual preferences varied, she just feels ordinary, like herself. \"I'm not a straight girl. I'm not a queer girl, either. I guess you could say I'm sexually fluid. Love comes in all shapes and flavors, and I just want to be able to taste them all.\"What some people don't realize is that Tesla's openness toward sex doesn't mean she's either unprincipled or unfeeling. And what Tesla doesn't realize is the fact that people \"really don't know me at all\" could make her very vulnerable to being hurt.One of Tesla's favorite customers is Meredith, a beautiful and charismatic married woman who's constantly after stories of Tesla's \"wild, crazy\" life. When Meredith tells Tesla that she and her husband want to live out a fantasy about him with another woman, Tesla is more interested in being with Meredith. Her previous experience with a threesome did not end well: \"The three of us could've made a circle, soft and smooth, but what had happened made us into a triangle with sharp, stabbing points.\" But Meredith's husband Charlie turns out to be an attractive, adorable man, making the possibility of being with both of them an apparent win-win.In the past, I've sometimes thought that Hart's books were negative towards polyamorous people, but I didn't feel that here. I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that serious problems arise in the threesome, but it's not that the situation itself is inherently bad, more that the motivations behind it were. I really like how Tesla is depicted here, as someone who simply accepts her varied enjoyment of sex without feeling odd or out there. It's also not the only important aspect of her character: she is also loyal, sensitive and kind, deserving of the love of someone, or several someones.My main problem with the book was that I never liked Meredith or found her remotely attractive, which made it hard to understand Tesla's feelings for her. (Or Charlie's, for that matter.) From her first introduction, she seemed superficial and insincere. I also found the ending of the story a bit abrupt and unsatisfying, almost tacked on. But I love Hart's quiet yet tension-filled writing, which gives tremendous power to her sex scenes. The story was compulsively readable; I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to read erotica that is really about who people are, not just what they like to do in bed.

She is working a seemingly dead end job as a coffee barista. Seen as a wild child, Tesla is actually quite sedate. She doesn't want to stick out and is happily living one day at a time.Telsa's life is complicated with relationships that are not within the norm. While she did have two parents and one brother, it wasn't a conventional family. They spent summers at a hippie commune where her parents were swinging. Telsa's sexual education and freedom is unorthodox which shaped her life. Even her first experiences were a bit out of the ordinary which makes her so attractive.This attraction is what pulls Meredith, one of her regular customers to her. Meredith stops by the coffee shop every day and wants to hear stories about other people's lives. She so stunning, Telsa can not help, but fall for her. Tesla is sexually fluid so for her, it's an unrequited crush. Meredith is married so there is no hope for Telsa, or is there? After months of afternoon coffee, Meredith springs the question. \"Will you fuck my husband while I watch?\" Telsa is shocked as this is not what she's expecting. This story is one of alternative love and the downright difficulties people face. I'm no stranger to a poly relationship but I can say that it would not work for me. For Telsa who wants a true threesome, it comes close to crushing her. Because one of the triad is going in with a false guise. This is a triangle as Meredith truly loves her husband, Charlie. Charlie falls for Telsa. Telsa has been in love with Meredith the entire time.Ms. Hart creates another fabulous story with heartbreak and bittersweet endings. She shows the good, bad and ugly side of menages as well as poly relationships. It's not easy and the communication required is of utmost importance. Unfortunately, when one of the members is going in to get something else out of it, it breaks the circle of trust - completely.This story is watching a train derail. I know what will happen. How it happens or what causes the train to finally come off the tracks, this is what I'm waiting to see, with my gut clenching in apprehension. While it is no one's fault, the train wreck causes massive collateral damage. It's heartbreaking and there is no way to fix it. As in, Ms. Hart never fixes the stories where it's all happily ever after as if no one has been hurt. Instead, she creates survivors who start a new chapter in their life - because nothing ever stays the same. If there is one thing to be taken away from this moving love story is - go in with your eyes wide open. The twists and turns in this story melded along with Telsa's past relationships add a depth. We see how Telsa's character is shaped and what she's really longing to be. Her journey through pain and joy is what makes this book so powerful. Even if I'm not a fan of Telsa's lifestyle or choices, Ms. Hart creates a character who is engaging and above all, desirable by being herself. Telsa isn't weak nor is she perfect. I highly recommend this story to romance readers who want to read the unvarnished truths of a menage relationship.*ARC from http://www.netgalley.com/*"}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose", "userReview": "Initial reaction:Megan Hart's \"The Space Between Us\" is a story of exploration of a young woman with a damaged history trying to find a place/space to feel loved. There are many paths that she takes in the path of that, but ultimately, Tesla's journey takes her full circle to find the relationship she ultimately wants, and it's more that she knows what she wants, but doesn't know how to assert it.I liked the story arc well enough and understood the journey as far as how it transpired, but I'll admit I wasn't enamored with it in certain spells - there were many things I had to swallow and just outright didn't sit well with me. For one, I never had a point where I really liked Meredith, but in a way, I think that was intentional, considering her character collectively. There were dimensions of the story I think could've used more exploration, but somehow, I still found myself following Tesla in the scheme of her relationships - both romantic and familial.Full review:Even after taking a day to think about my sentiments surrounding \"The Space Between Us\", I find myself in a conflicted space. On one hand, I love Megan Hart's writing and her ability to weave the relationships between her characters with such ease. The slice of life format didn't bother me either - I like delving into the characters day-to-day trials and experiences, and I like establishing the bonds and connections in the primary character's life.Yet, as only the third full novel I've read in Hart's erotica bibliography - I don't think this is as strong of an effort as some of her previous works. It hit me with some emotional punches in certain parts of the novel, but they were more on the familial side rather than the romantic side, which I thought could've been better than it was. The reason I say that is because I think Hart could've delved a bit more into the dynamic of what developed as a menage relationship between three very flawed characters who somehow converge and collide in different angles. Tesla and her brother Cap originally came from a household of hippies who lead a very controversial lifestyle, and it was only by Vic and Elaine's hand of taking them in that their respective lives were able to be stable enough to grow from their rather rough childhood, which included watching their sexually adventurous parents at a young age. Yet, Tesla herself has moved through a number of relationships where she's tried to be in a menage, even as early as her teens (with twins, no less), but the result had left a trail of broken hearts and old wounds. In her mid twenties, in the present day, Tesla's working at the Morningstar Mocha with her usual coworkers, making a living for herself. She doesn't expect to come across the rather flighty personality of Meredith, who seems insistent on knowing more about Tesla's more \"adventurous\" side. Tesla's sexual preferences are bisexual, and she tells Meredith stories of her sexual encounters. It's only a matter of time before Meredith makes a rather odd proposition - Tesla becoming involved with her and her husband, Charlie.From there, the story toggles between the relationship that Tesla has with Charlie and Meredith, and her home life with Vic, Elaine and their two kids. Some of the scenes between Tesla, Charlie, and Meredith are very hot in intensity, but I felt a disconnect because Meredith was very unlikable (she's flighty, quick to slut shame, and insufferably moody), while Charlie I wish could've had more meat to his persona, I felt he was more told than shown in terms of his characterization in spurts.The real fruit of the novel for me was showing Tesla's famlilial relationships and how she dealt with Vic, Elaine and living with their growing family. The interactions between them were interesting, though I noted Tesla's complicated relationship with Vic in past considerations, which brought some interesting eyes of conflict in present terms. I think the core of the conflict resonated more with them and the affections lent in that circle (along with Tesla's brother Cap) were worth watching through the novel. It gave additional dimensions in how Tesla felt a bit of a third wheel in her relationships. In the end, I think there's a full circle established in that Tesla has to stand up and assert what she wants in her relationship, but I think it could've had much more connectivity than it had. Towards the end, it culminated in a fallout that was inevitable given the circumstances, and I appreciated seeing that, but I don't know if the impact had as much punch as it could've had. Perhaps with more dimensional attention to both Charlie and Meredith (even with Meredith's unlikable traits), it could've been better established.Still, I thought it was a decent novel of its particular genre and consideration. It didn't completely immerse me, but I liked parts of it enough where it stood out. I just think some of Hart's other works had a little more impact on me than this one.Overall score: 3/5Note: I received this as an ARC from NetGalley, from the publisher Harlequin."}, {"userName": "Letitia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4952315-letitia", "userReview": "Rating: B- ... Heat: HotThe Space Between Us starts with the end, so it only seems appropriate for me to do the same. This book very nearly does not give us a HEA. This stomach churning, emotion playing story waits to the last \u2013 the very last \u2013 possible moment to give us a hint, a peak, at the possibility of a HEA. Which, though it felt completely unsatisfying, did fit with the overall tone. Megan Hart did an excellent job toying with my emotions. By the very end, my stomach was such a mess that I wondered if a book could truly make me sick. This one came very close.Tesla, our narrator, is a free spirit. A wild child, or so everyone assumes. She and her brother were raised by free lovin\u2019, commune living, swinger partying parents. Her summers were spent at the commune, where the children roamed free and were encouraged to... explore. So, for Tesla, her ways aren\u2019t wild. They simply... are what they are. She doesn\u2019t even consider herself bisexual, so much as open to all possibilities. Which proves beyond intriguing to one of Tesla\u2019s coffeehouse patrons, Meredith. Meredith is beautiful and captivating and, quite clearly, bored with her life. She flirts and cajoles her way into people\u2019s lives, extracting their most interesting stories from them. Almost as if she gets a thrill living vicariously through them. And Tesla\u2019s stories are about as thrilling as it gets.Many scenes throughout this story were told as flashbacks, Tesla sharing parts of her past with Meredith. And, wow, those memories pack a punch. Nearly every single one had me squirming in my seat... some because they were sexy, some because they were agonizing. Each memory left me feeling like a voyeur. Miz Hart writes with such realism that it almost feels like an invasion of someone else\u2019s privacy. Eventually things between Tesla and Meredith move past the point of sharing stories in the coffeehouse. Meredith begins to invite Tesla out with her\u2014dinner, drinking, dancing. The two women get to know each other better. Which is almost painful to watch, as Tesla\u2019s feelings for Meredith are clearly not reciprocated... and Meredith uses Tesla\u2019s feelings to her own benefit throughout. The dates, the teasing, it all leads to Meredith asking Tesla to sleep with her husband, Charlie. And even though you know it\u2019s inevitable, you can\u2019t help thinking, \u2018Oh, no, Tesla. C\u2019mon. You know you should say no.\u2019 But she doesn\u2019t. And thus begins the most torturous and uncomfortable m\u00e9nage that I have ever read.Because Tesla wants Meredith, and Tesla wants Charlie. Charlie wants Tesla, and Charlie wants Meredith. And Meredith simply goes through the motions, clearly not truly wanting either. Meredith is searching for a feeling, a thrill, an experience. Which is relatable\u2014we all get bored sometimes. But her actions make her so damn unlikeable. There wasn\u2019t a single moment that I thought, \u2018Meredith is a good person.\u2019 Because if she is, it is buried way, way underneath.The Space Between Us is the story of a m\u00e9nage gone wrong. Of one woman finding her home, her place, in another person for the first time only to have it torn asunder. It is the story of another woman\u2019s selfish quest for excitement and the mess she leaves behind. And Miz Hart pulls no punches. It hits you like a mac truck. Be prepared to... feel.Favorite Quote:\"Promise me,\" Vic said.\"What?\" I pushed up on my toes to get closer to his mouth, so my lips moved against his.\"Promise me you'll never let anyone make you feel you're not beautiful.

MeganHart.com -- Upcoming THE SPACE BETWEEN US is a hot piece of erotic fiction. A first I thought it was going to be a series of sketches sewn together with Tesla and Meredith as the thread. But then it moves from being the stories Tesla tells Meredith, to being Tesla's story.Extroverted Meredith collects things, stories, people. She bores easily and is very self-centered, showy, and loves to be the show. There's something missiing in her though; something that allows her to thoughtlessly wound the people in her life.Tesla is a bit of a drifty sort. Not a drifter--just a bit aimless, she is bi-sexual, seems young and yet mature. Terrible parenting granted her a difficult and unusual life that left her just out of the mainstream. The third in the equation is the solid Charlie. He's a man who is willing to do what his wife wants, even if it means engaging in sexual exploration that really goes in a different direction than the one he set up for himself.The writing reminded me of Anais Nin--but a twenty-first century Nin. The story is written in a first-person point of view. It's Tesla's and the voice is rings true. The sex is well-written, interesting and neither vanilla or too extreme. There's a lot of story here. The sex occurs as part of the story, not as its entirety. It doesn't just pop up out of the blue but occurs with enough motive and advances the story. So often it's the other way around in this genre. The emotional conflicts and plot are well developed and subtly revealed. There is one point where you know two people in the triangle have become more like a pair when their relationship with each other develops as the other two relationships pull away. How that happens is something you'll need to read; revealing it would be spoilerish. Tesla's childhood makes her understanding of couplehood and marriage well-defined and she doesn't have a lot of taboos.I found the story moving and the romance electrifying.

She is a freaking magician. When I read her books, usually I want to make up literary awards, and give them to her. This book proved once again that picking up my first Megan Hart book was one of the best decisions regarding reading I ever made.Even before I started it, I had a very strong feeling I would love it. The combination of that cover, title, and author made me lust after it as soon as I saw it. It wasn't until I was holding the book in my hands that I realized I hadn't even read the blurb. Ooops. Luckily for me, my feeling was right. I knew it the moment I read opening line: \nEveryone has a story. Here's how this one ends.\n\nThe Space Between Us\n -- I loved everything and everyone in it. Tesla was another heroine I loved reading about, her life, past and present, so masterfully told like only M. Hart knows. She wouldn't call herself wild, but the life she had led was unconventional. Even her name was special, and I loved it. All that gave her interesting stories to tell about her past. Meredith was very interested in hearing people's stories, especially Tesla's. And the real story from the book began when Meredith asked Tesla to sleep with her husband. When I said I loved everyone in the book, I lied -- Meredith was the exception. All the things she did were like she was trying to be the center of attention, like all she wanted was to be entertained. But I guess it all worked out for the best.Charlie was lovely. Even though, just like in the previous books I read by this author, the focus was on the main female character (which is something else I love about Hart's books), and the male lead was more of a supporting character, I still grew to like him a lot, even wish for my own Charlie.\nEveryone has a story. This is how this one begins.\nSpeaking of men I want for myself... I loved how some characters from the previous novels made an appearance. Eric from Switch was there still writing on his legal pad. Once there was even a box with fine paper in it. I'd love a book with him.Sadie from Broken was there and Joe. Even Brandy, and she was still chewing gum! Oh, Brandy... She even caused some trouble with Sadie, and Joe.

Se la vostra risposta \u00e8 stata la \"a\".. Complimenti! Siete i fantastici vincitori del premio \"Oltre la prima occhiata!\". Se invece avete risposto \"c\", non vincete niente, ma sapete quale sia stato il mio stato d'animo durante la lettura.Mentre leggevo questo libro ho provato a giustificarlo dicendomi che non era colpa sua se mi stavo annoiando e non mi stava prendendo per niente.. Mi sono rifugiata nel fatto che \"Il genere erotico non fa proprio per me\".Per\u00f2 \u00e8 una bugia. Insomma, sono una lettrice eclettica e camaleontica, leggo tutto di tutti (a patto che l'autore non mi faccia grande antipatia, in quel caso non c'\u00e8 proprio niente da fare), non mi scoraggia (quasi) niente e so trovare il buono in ogni cosa purch\u00e9 scritta bene. Ho letto opere in cui il sesso era presente, spesso in modo tangibile, per cui non credo sia il genere a darmi problemi..Ho anche pensato che magari il problema fosse con il tipo di sesso che viene qui descritto -tra una coppia sposata e un'altra ragazza bisessuale- che mi metteva a disagio, per\u00f2 no, non credo sia nemmeno questo..Dopo varie elugubrazioni, sono arrivata alla conclusione che \u00e8 l'insieme della storia, dei personaggi e del modo in cui \u00e8 scritto a non essermi piaciuto.Per prima cosa, il libro mi sembra una scorrettezza a livello tramistico/di sviluppi: il problema vero \u00e8 che NON c'\u00e8 una trama. Non ci sono sviluppi. Non ci sono elementi sensati che permettono di appassionarsi alla storia. Tutto ruota intorno a questa strana proposta che Meredith, moglie di Charlie, propone a Tesla, la EHM, protagonista della storia e vocce narrante: fare sesso a tre. Tutto il resto \u00e8 fuffa, \u00e8 messo l\u00ec per riempire 400 e passa pagine e per intortare il povero lettore immergendolo in mondi che non esistono.Sarei stata pi\u00f9 contenta se:a) Il libro avesse avuto 200 pagine di meno: insomma, mi dai un lieve background su Tesla, la sua famiglia e simili e poi ti diletti per le restanti pagine a parlare di questa relazione sessuale, tanto l'abbiamo capito tutti che il nocciolo della questione \u00e8 questo..b) Si fosse focalizzato esclusivamente sul sesso e via (no, non sono una persona morbosa, giuro! :D E' per dire che tutto mi sembra un'alternativa migliore di quella scelta dalla Hart..).Io capisco, comprendo e in linea teorica condivido, il fatto che dal momento che un genere letterario ha successo, \u00e8 bene cavalcare l'onda e produrre produrre produrre. E anzi, dal poco che ho visto io in giro, l'idea della Hart su un rapporto a tre \u00e8 pure parecchio innovativo (Ora esce fuori che in realt\u00e0 non \u00e8 affatto cos\u00ec, stai a vedere xD).. Per\u00f2 non mi va gi\u00f9 che si usi l'espediente del momento -sia esso i vampiri, i licantropi, gli angeli, il sesso, i pagliacci, le barbie o i teletubbies- e poco altro: oltre all'idea, ci vuole anche un minimo di capacit\u00e0 a portarla avanti!!Cosa che, secondo me, la Hart proprio non possiede. I personaggi sono contraddittori e davvero poco 'vivi'; la storia \u00e8 buttata l\u00ec a casaccio con alcuni elementi che dovrebbero attirare l'attenzione ma che in tutta sincerit\u00e0 a me hanno fatto fare grandi sbadigli; le contraddizioni e le frasi senza il minimo senso.. Giusto per darvi un'idea, ecco la perla di saggezza:\"Le lenzuola erano CROCCANTI sotto i palmi\"Ora.LE LENZUOLA CROCCANTI?! A me quando gli scrittori fanno i furbetti cercando di sfruttare in modo 'poetico' le parole fanno salire la bile al cervello.. Ma che senso ha?!Certo, sto sempre leggendo un libro tradotto, quindi magari si \u00e8 perso il senso originale.. Per\u00f2 nel libro ci sono altre perle simili, quindi non me la sento di discolpare totalmente la Hart! Per 0,474495475492 millisecondi mi \u00e8 quasi presa la tentazione di leggere il libro in inglese e dimostrare la mia teoria.. Poi per fortuna l'idea se ne \u00e8 andata velocemente come era arrivata ._.Sempre per quanto riguarda la scrittura, essendo un libro *erotico* e sul *sesso*, io credo abbia ampiamente disatteso le mie aspettative. Non so cosa mi aspettassi, effettivamente, visto che la mia unica altra lettura (pseudo) erotica \u00e8 stata \"50 sfumature di blablabla\" (E a salti perch\u00e9 mi son rifiutata di leggerlo tutto).. Per\u00f2 non mi aspettavo nemmeno che mentre mi venivano descritte scene ad alta tensione erotica (a detta di Tesla, ovviamente), io vagassi con la mente e facessi i peggio collegamenti.. Davvero, sembrava stesse raccontando di quando si \u00e8 andata a fare le unghie all'estetista.. Della fila che ha trovato al supermercato, della pizza riscaldata al microonde, del tacco che si \u00e8 rotto in mezzo ai Sanpietrini.. Insomma, ho reso l'idea, no? Pathos, questo sconosciuto!! Diamine gente, state facendo sesso, state provando piacere, state avendo orgasmi.. Che \u00e8 'sta mosceria?!

Tesla a mio parere avrebbe meritato tanti di quegli schiaffi da scordarsi come si prepara il caff\u00e9.. Veramente odiosa, sciocca, priva di ogni attrattiva (ma tutti la amano e la venerano, ovvio) e irritante.Da come parla, agisce o pensa (perch\u00e9 la cosa grave \u00e8 che ne \u00e8 davvero convinta, povera anima), sembra sia sopravvissuta per miracolo ai campi di concentramento; Tu l\u00ec a pensare che ha avuto un'infanzia difficile, un passato da cui \u00e8 miracolosamente scampata, un destino atroce.. E quando pian piano questo pseudo passato misterioso e 'angosciante' viene ricostruito, ti senti beffata e presa in giro. Perch\u00e9 NO, non c'\u00e8 niente di cos\u00ec traumatizzante che possa giustificare il suo 'Non ho avuto una vita facile', 'Non mi capisci', 'Tutti affrontiamo delle difficolt\u00e0 nella vita' e via discorrendo. (Non so se queste frasi Tesla le abbia dette o meno, non ricordo.. Il senso delle sue affermazioni/pensieri per\u00f2 \u00e8 questo, giuro!).Poi c'\u00e8 Meredith. E ragazzi, che personaggio! Totalmente privo di senso. Totalmente soggetto alle leggi inspiegabili del Caos primordiale e della nota morale di alcuni scrittori: \"Mbho, io scrivo quello che mi passa per la mente, che problema c'\u00e8 se poi mi contraddico o la cosa non ha senso?

It's about feeling connected, companionship, respect, trust, love, and family. Tesla works in a coffee house called Mocha where she meets Meredith. Meredith is an exciting woman that gets the regulars in the coffee house to tell her their craziest stories where Meredith seems to want to live vicariously through these people's lives. Tesla finds herself attracted and enthralled by this blue-eyed, vivacious beauty. When Meredith asks Tesla to have sex with her husband while she watches, Tesla is a little unsettled by this offer but her crush on Meredith has her saying yes. After Tesla meets Charlie, they both find they have instant chemistry and from there, a menage relationship is formed.There are two parts to Tesla's story, the present and the past. The reader is shown flashbacks of Tesla's life as s teenager. These stories are personal and intimate looks of her life where she is discovering and defining herself as a person. The reader will also see how she and her brother end up living with her friend, once crush, Vic and his family. This family has been her home and safety for many years. When things become complicated in Vic's home, Tesla decides it's time for her to move out where she then moves in with Meredith and Charlie. Tesla walks to the beat of her own drum. Being in a menage relationship doesn't feel odd or strange to her. She's a free-spirit and makes no apologies for who she is or her sexuality. She's honest, kind, and straight-forward. There were times when I thought she was a little naive when it came to Meredith but far from stupid. She made some bad decisions that I think come from feeling rejected and abandoned. Tesla has a strong need and desire to feel safe and be a part of a family.Meredith is a hard character to embrace. I was completely weary of her from the beginning. I immediately thought her character was overly abrasive. Her curiosity to know so much about Tesla made me feel suspcious. But then the author begins to show us a little bit more about Meredith - a softer side to her. And just when I would warm up to Meredith, she would do something that would raise my hackles. There are so many adjectives to describe Meredith. She's smart, beautiful, curious, manipulative, self-absorbed, and cold. This woman confused me. One moment she would be happy and care-fee, the next moment she would be upset about something. I began to wonder if she was bi-polar. It was really hard see beneath the layers of who Meredith really is. She came across as the villain in this story and who knows, maybe that's what the author was aiming for. Hats off to Meagan Hart for writing such a complex character. And the final person in the menage relationship is Charlie, who is Meredith's husband. I found him to be a very kind and generous man who wears his heart on his sleave. I'm not surprised he and Tesla got along so well. They are both passive and laid back. They initially bonded because of Meredith but then they soon realized they have a lot in common and genuinely liked to spend time together alone, without Meredith. Oh, what a sticky, guilty web this wove. Charlie being passive didn't bother me. I'm married to a passive man myself. What bothered me is the way he let Meredith dictate their marriage. I really wanted him to step up. It bothered me that he didn't notice issues with Meredith before Tesla came into the picture. It makes me wonder if Charlie was completely oblivious to who his wife really was until Tesla came along. Thankfully, by the end of the story, Charlie found his balls, but I wish it was sooner rather than later. The chemistry in the bedroom between these three was sizzling. I didn't have any uncomfortable feelings with the menage scenes since all three people were in agreement to be together intimately. What bothered me the most was the way Meredith was so stand-offish towards Tesla. I wish Tesla would have gotten a clue that Meredith wasn't genuine about their relationship. Meredith just wanted an experience while the other players in her game were emotionally invested and being hurt in the process. Her careless actions were a punch in the gut. I wasn't surprised by what happed between these three people but it didn't lessen the pain any less. My heart ached for both Tesla and Charlie. Sometimes you read a book and you have certain expectations before you even start it. That was the case with The Space Between Us. I had read some reviews and there are quite a few mixed opinions on this book which caused me to form my own opinion before I even started reading this book. Nobody's fault but my own. But because I did this, I struggled with the characters at first. So, I put the book down for a little while and went back to it later after thinking about it. Once I picked it back up with a clear head, I was completely absorbed by the story, and unable to put it down. I don't think this story will be for everyone. I can guarantee the reader will be frustrated with Meredith. But without Meredith's character, I don't think this story would have been as enthralling to me. Her character added a lot of depth to the story. Meagan Hart has a way with writing deep, emotional stories with realistic, flawed characters. Love can be messy and this story portrays exactly how messy it can be. By the end, I was so emotionally drained that it was good to see Tesla remain true to herself with some character growth and not be soured by her experience with Meredith. -- A Romantic Book Affairs Review\nFind us on Twitter and Facebook too!\nARC kindly provided by Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Francesca the Fierce (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3108364-francesca-the-fierce-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "3.75 starsThis review was posted at Under the CoversThe wait between when we get a novel from Megan Hart is terrible for me, so when I saw that she was releasing this book I did my \"hell-yeah-we-are-getting-a-MH-book\" happy dance. Quite frankly, I hardly ever read the blurbs and I stay away from any spoilers or excerpts because I want the book to speak to me. Megan Hart's writing is one of those rare voices that can tell a a sad and oftentimes hard story beautifully. It sucks you in and grabs you because you have to know what happens, how it ends. THE SPACE BETWEEN US was no different. I couldn't put the book down even when I thought the storyline was going places I didn't think I wanted to go.I'll be honest here and say that I was not too thrilled to find out this book had a f/f/m menage. I don't read f/f and I wasn't sure if I wanted to but I trust the author so I just went with it. Our heroine, Tesla, has had a rough life. Nothing ordinary or normal, more like crazy and sometimes wild. Even though she doesn't see herself as wild. Her parents were I guess swingers and, during the summers, they would take her and her brother, Captain, to a type of sex commune, The Compound. There kids were even encouraged to explore and learn sexualy, either by themselves or with other kids. She also met Vic there, who happened to be the rock to support her and get her out of that situation. They bonded and a sort of love formed, even though he was older than her and they never really had sex.Fast forward and now she's living with Vic. Vic is married and has two kids and another on the way. Tesla is in her mid twenties and works at a coffee shop (the same one where Johnny from COLLIDE goes to get his coffee). She has a sort of crush on one of the customers, Meredith. Meredith wants to be Tesla, she wants to be wild and free, to experience things. So, she asked Tesla to have sex with her husband. That slowly develops into Tesla, Meredith and Charlie being a part of a threesome. And then the reality of that sets in.I did not like Meredith. I know her character is meant to be the way she is but I thought she was a bit of a lost soul and wanted to slap her around and smack some sense into her most of the time. Tesla on the other hand, you can't help but feel for her. You get her present story but also some of her past. And now she has to deal with a lot of changes and different emotions. This book was really the evolution of Tesla for me, from what she had to live through, her teenage years to now. Her conflicting relationships with her family and that is in big part Vic, who has always been there for her. With Meredith and her attraction to her but also her attraction to Charlie. Changes and emotions and pain.And then there's Charlie who seemed to be the glue holding everything together. The things he did and how he knew just what to say to make Tesla, and even Meredith, feel comfortable and happy. How he went out of his way so that everyone would be happy. He felt real if not the ideal of an alpha male we are so used to read about. I enjoyed the few cameo appearances in this book by Johnny from COLLIDE and most of all Sadie and Joe from BROKEN. Sadie is now pregnant and Joe is still in love and devoted to her. So nice to see them and know what they are doing.I kept waiting for the waterworks to start, because I always cry when I read a book by this author, but I have to say the tear jerker factor in this one was lower than others. I did still cry at the end. And I was happy at the end, although I guess I would've wanted to have more, maybe even one more chapter or an epilogue.Favorite quotes:\"I would bang that man like a screen door in a hurricane.\"\"Can't say I've buffed my muffin over it or anything.\"*ARC provided by Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Desperado", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3422821-desperado", "userReview": "ARC provided by Harlequin and Netgalley. Thank you!A caveat: I'm a rabid, unashamed Megan Hart fan. I've read seven books by her, including this one, and while they haven't all been great, I've found that (for me at least) Hart consistently churns out interesting and intriguing books that turn me into a happy, emotional wreck.The Space Between Us follows Tesla Martin, a 26-year-old Barista who works at Morningstar Mocha (a coffee shop that's been featured in at least one other Hart novel). She and her younger brother Captain were raised by unconventional parents who took them to a commune during the summer where Tesla and Captain ran wild while their parents engaged in sex with other couples. Suffice it to say, Tesla's upbringing makes her an extremely interesting protagonist. At the coffee shop, she becomes friends with Meredith, a glamorous, married older woman of leisure. Tesla is insanely attracted to Meredith but knows it won't go anywhere, so when Meredith asks her point blank if Tesla will have sex with her husband, Tesla is more than a little shocked.Menages are not something I'm unfamiliar with when it comes to Hart. Her erotic romance, Tempted was about a menage and the ramifications of one. So I had an idea of what to expect going into TSBU. Having a romantic relationship with one person is hard enough without adding someone else to the mix. I fully believe that they can work-if everyone goes into with eyes wide open, aware of what they want and what they don't want from each other. That was not the case with TSBU, as I'm sure is true for a lot of real life menages. Yes, a big part of this book was dedicated to the relationship between Tesla, Meredith and her husband, Charlie. But a lot of it was about Tesla finding her own self. In this book, Tesla learned what she wanted and what she was unwilling to take. She also discovered pieces of herself that she never realized were broken and voids that she didn't realize she wanted to fill. I wish Hart had've delved deeper into the comfortable and utterly complicated relationship between Tesla and Vic (a friend who she has lived with since the age of seventeen) but I guess if she did, the mystery would be gone. I also wish the ending of TSBU wasn't so abrupt, but I feel that way about every single Hart novel I've read. That's probably apart of Hart's diabolical plan to leave her readers panting and begging for more.The title for this book is appropriate in so many ways. Not only is it about the space between Tesla, Meredith and Charlie but it's also about the space between what you think you're content to have and what you're afraid to want."}, {"userName": "Lady Allison", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2802505-lady-allison", "userReview": "Tesla Martin is not really sure what she\u2019s doing with her life, but she\u2019s not exactly in a hurry to figure it out either. She works at Morningstar Mocha as everyone\u2019s favorite barista while living with the man (and his wife and two adorable kids) who took her and her brother in when her parents decided their lives were more important than that of their children. Tesla enjoys the customer interaction and the constant stream of caffeine. However, there is one regular in particular that she wants to be more than just a barista to \u2013 Meredith. Meredith is one of those people that is so charismatic that she can convince you to tell her anything, to confide over a cup of coffee (or three) with a sparkle of mischief in her eye. And Tesla does. She lays bare her history in hopes the connection will give them an intimate edge she might not otherwise have\u2026considering Meredith is a married woman. The story she weaves definitely has an effect on her, but not in a way Tesla expects. Meredith begins to flirt, to get to know her better, to develop a more-than-a-regular rapport with her only to invite her to bed\u2026 to sleep with her husband. While shocked, Telsa considers it, requiring she meet Meredith\u2019s husband Charlie first. When the three of them meet up for a very unorthodox date, they immediately click and end up talking and laughing the night away. One date turns into two, turns into three, turns into falling into bed together. All together. In the beginning, the relationship was definitely geared more towards Tesla trying to get closer to Meredith, but the more she got to know Charlie (who is incredibly irresistible, no doubt about it!) the more she explored the extraordinarily complex dynamic between them. I liked Meredith for the purpose she served in the story but the characters that really shone for me were Charlie and Tesla. The way they completely changed for Meredith but owned their change and made it work for them so thoroughly, impressed me. I loved the way Charlie and Tesla bonded, the way he stood up for her, made her feel so special. Their relationship was such a pleasure to read. My favorite aspect about any Megan Hart book is her characters. They are always so real; their emotions inspire you to feel, to experience life through their eyes. This book is no exception. While it certainly makes you think twice and can serve as a cautionary tale to be careful of what you invite in your bed and in your marriage \u2013 the other side of the coin shows us that not all connections we find in life will be conventional and that if it\u2019s real, it\u2019s worth fighting for.

Her female crush, Meredith, suggest a a daring experiment including her husband Charlie and Tesla. How can Tesla resist? A chance to get nearer to Meredith , who knows what might happen next. It sounds like an easy choice but nothing in life is as easy as it seems at first glance. An uncomplicated and liberal engagement can turn into something serious and strict very quick and so Tesla finds herself in tangle of hopes, expectations and little untold truths.Tesla is not your ordinary girl even though she hates to see herself that way. She spent her childhood summers in a commune celebrating free life and love. Her past experiences did make her the woman she is now and her current living arrangements seem uncommon to the \u201cordinary\u201d observer. She\u2019s content with her current life- more or less, as most of us are. It\u2019s what her life is and she accepts it. Tesla\u2019s story is told in 2 parts. On the one hand we follow her current life and how her new relationship with Charlie and Meredith influences her life. On the other hand we get a glimpse of her teen years and made her into the person she is now. These two sides of the story show Tesla in many facets and gave me as a reader a really close grab of who she is. It\u2019s hard to explain in a few words but at the end of the book you will see who Tesla is and why she does the things she thinks need doing.I didn\u2019t much care for Meredith though. She\u2019s a glowing character who always seems to succeed in flocking people around herself. She needs the attention and even more so needs to be the center of everyone\u2019s intention. She is a fun person, full of energy and ideas. She\u2019s daring and always happy to take risks even if those might hurt some of the people around her. For me Meredith sometimes seems as if she really only cares about herself. She lives in her own personal little bubble and just ignores the needs of anyone around her. She\u2019s selfish and too self centered for my taste. I had a constant urge to slap her real hard.Charlie on the other hand is a lovely character. Oh this guy made me smile. I liked how laid back and nerdy he is. He\u2019s taking a bit of a backseat in the story as the focus lays on Tesla but every time we get a glimpse heThe relationship between these three is portrayed rather realistic. It\u2019s not your usual menage where everyone gets what he/she wants. We see the ups and downs, the good and the bad days. Like real life this relationship too has to survive the small problems and hurdles. It is, as I do expect from a Megan Hart novel, a retelling of the journey not the goal. I love that about her books! The close to truth factor you can find in each of Hart\u2019s stories.Another thing I loved is to see characters from other Megan Hart novels again. We do see quite some in this one. It\u2019s nothing really prominent and I\u2019m sure Megan Hart newbies wouldn\u2019t even notice but well it makes my heart sing to see some familiar faces.The Space Between Us is not your common romance novel. It goes deeper than the all shiny and happy HEA retellings and won\u2019t make dream of unicorns and sunshine. It challenges not only your heart but also your mind. You will catch yourself contemplating the ins and out of such a relationship and how it would work in real life. I admit The Space Between Us is not my favorite of Hart\u2019s work but still it made me turn the pages and tempted me to read just one more chapter till I reached the final one.I give The Space Between Us 4 Stars."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4129245-judy", "userReview": "[leading to a potential happily ever after (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "The Romance Evangelist", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5886357-the-romance-evangelist", "userReview": "*This book was provided to the reviewer by the author in exchange for an honest review at SeductiveMusings.blogspot.comI have to admit right up front that I am a huge fan of Megan Hart. One of the things I love most about her books is how she has, over time, created this vividly drawn world in and around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Characters from previous books often make appearances, but never in a way that expects you to have read those books or doesn\u2019t make sense within the current story. There are a wealth of both new and previously seen supporting characters in \u201cThe Space Between Us\u201d, most of whom we meet at Morningside Mocha, the coffee shop where Tesla Martin works.Tesla is a woman who has survived so much early in her life and now only wants to exist from day to day. She\u2019s trying to avoid any additional drama but knows that she\u2019ll never have more than she does right now if she doesn\u2019t take any chances. Everyone thinks she\u2019s a wild child based on her past (if they know it) and how she presents herself to others, but the sad truth is that her life is so dull that it\u2019s practically standing still.It\u2019s Meredith who sways Tesla into a sexual triad with her own husband Charlie, almost solely by her force of will. Charlie appears to be as passive as Tesla, but clearly loves his wife enough to make this change in his life to please her. But as Charlie and Tesla grow closer, it remains to be seen if Meredith will be content with their new arrangement.As I said before, I\u2019m a big Megan Hart fangirl. So it pains me to say that \u201cThe Space Between Us\u201d was not one that I enjoyed as much as usual. A big part of this was her decision to include a prologue that I considered tantamount to a spoiler. When the author tells me upfront where the plot is going to go, it alters my ability to fully immerse myself in the story. Thanks to that prologue, I had a nagging thought the whole time, wondering when we would get to that part. This type of early reveal may not be a problem for others, but if I had the ability to read this again for the first time, I would go right to Chapter One and skip the prologue. The good news is that aside from that one concern, this was another beautifully written Megan Hart story and I enjoyed being back in her world."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5301250-lori", "userReview": "What can I say that has not already been said about anything Megan Hart writes? She is a fantastic story teller. Her characters are always interesting and a few of them you just never forget. (Alex Kennedy stole my heart in Tempted, then again in Naked)The book starts with the ending of the story, however...This story centers about Tesla who works at a coffee shop and Meredith, a customer who comes in daily. Meredith is very charismatic and spends much of her time asking the regular customers as well as Tesla about personal things in their lives. Tesla is attracted to Meredith. At some point that attraction turns to Meredith asking Tesla to go out on a date. They end up at a night club where there is a bachelorette party going on and things really steam up when Meredith lip locks the bride to be in a dare. When the evening comes to an end shortly afterwards, Meredith asks Tesla if she'd be willing to fuck her husband Charlie. Telsa who grew up in a commune and now lives with a friend and his family (pregnant wife and children) decides to say yes to Meredith's proposal. As the 3 begin a very sexual relationship, feeling and real life start coming into play. What I loved about this book is the raw feeling you get at that moment when Meredith asks Tesla to fuck her husband. Every thing stops as you wait for Tesla to answer her. It lays out their every day fun as customer and server in an entirely different light. Emotions begin to run wild as they all 3 collide with each other as a whole or separately. Is it wrong to love a woman's husband or the woman more than her husband? Is it okay to go out to dinner alone with two while the other one is working. Do you have sex always as a threesome or is it okay for a one on one? The story opens up many questions beyond just the sexual roles people play when they go from a one on one relationship to a threesome. They also find themselves open to what happens when they run into friends in public or what they want to tell their families when they show up for a holiday dinner as a threesome together in a relationship."}, {"userName": "Risbee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4769615-risbee", "userReview": "I liked this one...a lot. Like, really a lot - but I can't really tell you why. It isn't one of those books that leaves you with the warm and fuzzies. Quite the opposite, in fact. When I first saw this book and the blurb on Netgalley, I wanted it. Badly. I mean, threesomes and bisexuality...hello! And I was so excited when I got a galley to read -- but it wasn't the quick-read tingly erotica that I thought I was going to get. There was so much more to the story than I could have possibly imagined.Lets face it, I read erotica because I don't \"live\" erotica. Most of us don't. I read it for the escape, the fantasy. But this particular story doesn't focus on the fantasy, it looks at what would probably happen. The realistic outcome of bringing a third person (Tesla) into an established relationship, in this case, Meredith and Charlie's marriage.Interspersed with the present day story are bits and pieces from Tesla's quirky and free-spirited past. Events and relationships that make her who she is today and that allow us a little peek into maybe why she makes the choices that she does. All she wants (but maybe doesn't realize at first) is to be loved. To have that connection with somebody, that all encompassing emotion that completes the empty pockets and spaces you don't notice until they are filled. And once the layers are peeled away and you find that love, then what?So yeah, there was that emotional element that I love so much. Even though there were times where I felt like I was gut-punched, it was legitimate emotion and none of it felt contrived. Well. Done.Basically, what I've been trying so hard to say is that Megan Hart managed to twist my emotions up in knots and I got so much more from this book than I expected. I look forward to reading more by her."}, {"userName": "Darcy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2225246-darcy", "userReview": "I loved Tesla right from the start, she seems to be a free spirit, one who marches to the beat of her own drummer. I liked how she was there for her friends and family, how she has built a new family for herself when her blood one imploded. At first I started out liking that Tesla found a new friend in Meredith, and how she was able to pull out stories of Tesla's past. It was in those stories that we get to know her better and you realize how those past events have had such a big impact on her life. I think it made her more open to possibilities of any kind in her life.I even liked how Meredith and Tesla's relationship changed at first. It didn't take me too long, though to realize it wouldn't last. Meredith seemed to be searching for something else, but she couldn't admit it to herself yet. As things started to go bad, I started to hate Meredith with her passive aggressive behavior. I wished that she could have just owned up to what she want, the hurt could have been avoided then.Where Tesla was at the end of the book was in a good place. She was finally on her own, had made peace with her family, still keeping her place with them, and starting a new relationship that had a familiar tether. My hope for them is that things work out. As a side note, I loved how past characters keep popping up in the coffee shop, reminding me of their stories."}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2126561-eva", "userReview": "4 Solid StarsI am a huge fan of Megan Hart's writing style. She has a way of making the characters come to life and has a way of making their flaws believable and many times enduring. Her books are gritty and real. Ms. Hart has the ability to take a heroine that is flawed, and who many would be quick to judge and condemn, and turn it all around and make her extremely likeable (and a true heroine). The Space Between Us jumped around quite a bit plot and character wise, so I had to be sure to pay attention while I read it. I knew this going in since I have read numerous books by this author before. In spite of the jumble of thoughts and characters, it all seemed to come together in a way that was very enjoyable but at the same cohesive in it's own special way. Ms. Hart's books are very thought provoking. They make you think of how people are perceived based on different personality traits and/or background. My only complaint was that the ending was entirely too short. I would have liked another chapter or at least an epilogue. It felt \"cut off\" to me. Great book, as are all of Megan Hart's, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre and doesn't want a \"fluff\" book."}, {"userName": "Sharon (Simi) Ehcstasy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3504603-sharon-simi-ehcstasy", "userReview": "This was the first book of Megan Hart that I have read and for that reason only I gave this four stars.

I got really wrapped up in the story and their lives. This plot centers around Tesla and her kinky fun-time m\u00e9nage, turned love affair, with Meredith and her husband, Charlie. It's a sexy, beautiful and sometimes heartbreaking story of the dance between three people, trying to fit together. There are MF, FF and MFF scenes, all done in descriptive and hot detail.
