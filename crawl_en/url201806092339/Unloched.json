As most of you have surely noticed I generally read in the genres, science fiction, fantasy and the historical end of things- biographies and historical fiction. This novel is pretty firmly what book snobs refer to as \"literary\" fiction, as opposed to \"Genre Fiction\".lit\u00b7er\u00b7ar\u00b7y /\u02c8lit\u0259\u02ccrer\u0113/ - AdjectiveConcerning the writing, study, or content of literature, esp. of the kind valued for quality of form.lit\u00b7er\u00b7a\u00b7ture /\u02c8lit(\u0259)r\u0259CH\u0259r/ Noun1 - Written works, esp. those considered of superior or lasting artistic merit: \"a great work of literature\".2 - Books and writings published on a particular subject: \"the literature on environmental epidemiology\".I get annoyed by this distinction, as if a novel or story has less value because it's science fiction, horror, or worst of all- popular. Stupid book snobs. Not that there aren't Genre snobs who are just as bad on the reverse end. But I like to remind people every once in a while that \"1984\" is Dystopian, \"Alice in Wonderland\" is high fantasy and \"Pride and Prejudice\" is actually a romance novel.Unloched however is much harder to pigeonhole. The story is told in a slightly flowery, slightly formal language i've often seen used by authors courting the \"literary\" title. But in this case it doesn't distract or detract from the work, and it's smooth and flows well. The story is almost purely character driven. It hinges on an event in the far past, understood differently by each of our three main characters; the twins and their mother. Their relationships with each other are unhinged by the separateness of their experiences and their inability to communicate those experiences isolates them from those who once were closest. Overall it was a good read, and Lemon-Scott draws you in emotionally to the point where you want to yell at the characters or bang their heads together. The real interest however lies in the exploration of how differently we each experience events, and how those differences can change not only who we are, but who we are perceived to be."}, {"userName": "Terri-ann Varga", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13703563-terri-ann-varga", "userReview": "Chilling and poetic, this family drama haunted me from page 1 to the emotive and tear-jerking page 172.The characters are deep and complex, especially the twin sisters Trina and Lauren. Their unresolved issues and sister rivalry are well portrayed making it easy for anyone to relate to. Gisella remained a mystery to me until the end. Her cool demeanor and damaged personality is caustic. I have no doubt however that this character could have her own novel. At times I wanted to skip past chapters with Gisella to get back to the sisters but her pivotal relationship with her daughters added another layer to the drama. The ominous undercurrents are brilliantly written and the prose beautiful. Every line has been crafted with thought.Unloched is the perfect tragedy."}, {"userName": "Mawson Bear", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8174258-mawson-bear", "userReview": "A mother and her twin daughters. You might at first leap to the conclusion that such a trio would form the tightest-knit of families. But it is the spaces between the three that Candice Lemon-Scott reveals. Things unsaid, doubts unshared. Small moments build on each other, with the twins in particular each assuming the other to somehow know far more of her inner world than she does in fact know.I found myself emotionally engaged, upset by the mother, mulling over the disappearance of the father, and willing the sisters to connect, to simply talk, to unlock themselves."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4436686-jane", "userReview": "Unloched by Candice Lemon-Scott4 StarsEver since Trina believed Lauren had been with her boyfriend behind her back the twins had not spoken. Now their mother is dying and her last wish is that the girls get together, fix up their old holiday house-boat and sell it. Along with Trina\u2019s husband Graham, they do the necessary work while also trying to mend their broken relationship.Unloched is an emotional journey and I found this book to be very touching. Candice gave us insights into the feelings of Trina, Lauren and their mother and it was easy to sympathise with them all for their part in the argument that tore them apart. This book definitely reiterates the importance of talking and gathering all the facts before you act in haste. It was a simple misunderstanding when they were teens that totally destroyed the close bond that most twins share, and it was easy to see where the story was going, there were no real big surprises or shocking twists in the plot.I soon became engrossed in the story, which was easy to do with Candice Lemon-Scott\u2019s writing, it was comfortable, descriptive and well edited. This isn\u2019t an action book filled with excitement and incidents, it is a drama and ambles along at a steady pace adequate for the tale. I would have liked a little more information on Hal and what became of him, some kind of comeuppance for his part in it all would have been good, but it\u2019s absence didn\u2019t take away my enjoyment of this great thought provoking story.Copy Supplied for review"}, {"userName": "Jill Smith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28698013-jill-smith", "userReview": "I thought this was a particularly haunting story, one I won't forget in a hurry.A simple concept of teenage sibling rivalry that taints the rest of the women's lives, their domineering and demanding mother now in aged care, plays one last trump card on her girls. They both rise to the bait and find that what they believe took place all those years ago was not quite what happened.The setting becomes a central character and Candice draws from her knowledge of a small overlooked tourist village, clinging to the lake and surrounded by water. The houseboat is easy to picture in it's run down state as the sisters begrudgingly take on the task of making it sale able.I really got involved in the dynamics of these three women and how they allowing simmering emotions to dictate their lives. It is so well written, Candice leaves a question mark at the end of the book, did the girls finally rekindle their childhood kinship or did that all come too late?I read this in a couple of days which is my best indication that it\u2019s a great book."}, {"userName": "Gladys Quintal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5151656-gladys-quintal", "userReview": "Unloched is a story about identical twin girls that were close as children, but a misunderstanding about a boyfriend causes them to drift apart. One is left to care for a terminally ill and ungrateful mother, while the other moves away and starts a life of her own.I was drawn into the story from the start, identifying with the over strict and unreasonable mother and the helplessness that the girls must have felt being raised in that atmosphere. One of the girls was blinded by jealousy and failed to see how misplaced that was. It was very sad and the mother could have repaired their bond so easily if she had really tried.I read the book in one sitting as I needed to know if the secret came out in the end. I would definitely like to read more work from this author and highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Vacen Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6804378-vacen-taylor", "userReview": "Unloched by Candice Lemon-Scott is an emotionally charged story. In Unloched we meet Lauren and Trina, identical twins, and as the story progresses they reveal more and more of themselves and their lives both past and present. I won\u2019t give too much away of the plot, but I can say that the key I think, and in fact the most powerful feature for me, was the truth in the unseen connections between twins. A mother\u2019s dying wish brings the girls back together to fix up an old house-boat ready to sell. The work begins and over this time they work at repairing their shattered relationship. Candice touches on something that is real for many families. A situation when communications breakdown and assumptions become the basis for all reason, ending the bond between siblings.This novel draws you in and keeps you engaged long after you have finish reading it."}, {"userName": "Joshua Donellan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5344604-joshua-donellan", "userReview": "This is a very delicate, beguiling novel. While the plot is appropriately sparse, the descriptions and characterisation are just enthralling. You can nearly feel the lake underneath the houseboat shifting and rippling as you read. A very subtle, haunting piece of work filled with elegant writing and well crafted dialogue. Disclaimer: Candice and I share the same publisher.Anti-Disclaimer: This kind of subject matter normally bores me to tears.

This story deserved the attention it received in the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards. Set in the hauntingly beautiful Gippsland Lakes district, Unloched is a carefully thought out expose of the lives of twins Lauren and Trina. When their unique sisterhood turns sour following a series of cataclysmic events one stormy afternoon in their teens, their paths appear to have forever taken opposite directions. Reacting to the request of their mother, the twins reunite albeit begrudingly to restore the old family houseboat. It is here, once again surrounded by the shadows of the lake that they most both acknowledge some painful truths; about themselves and the ruinous role their mother played in their upbringing. Accomplished children's author, Lemon-Scott's adult prose demonstrates a genuine and sympathetic understanding of estranged human emotions and a sharp appreciation of the peoples and landscape she sets this story around; I could almost hear the swans tootling and smell the tea-tree addled waters. Poignant and stirring with enough drama to keep you page turning till the end."}, {"userName": "Cindy Cipriano", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13418691-cindy-cipriano", "userReview": "Unloched is lyrical in its narration and brutally honest in its dialogue.

Unable to come to terms with the end of her marriage, Gisella is a mother in name only to Lauren and Trina. The girls have one thing: each other.

It is so beautiful and delicate that I couldn't put it down for anything other than to sleep. The dialogue is powerful and the plot is heartbreaking.I don't even think I can explain the emotions that went through me as I read Unloched. There was just so much going on that it took me a few days to really process how amazing the twin characters are.It takes real talent to be able to jump from writing for children to writing for adults and for that, I think Candice is definitely a writer to keep an eye on."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14405217-julie", "userReview": "I recieved this novel from NetGalley. this novel started out as slow and confusing yet it bloomed into something moving. it is a tale of twins and their battles with their mother and their inner demons.

That moment when Lauren's hand slipped out of Trina's, she just knew that everything will change from then on, and it did. In the latter part of the story, Trina thought that Lauren went behind her back and was secretly seeing her boyfriend, Hal, even though that was not the real deal.Gisella, their mother, has one dying wish and that is to reunite the girls by making them fix the houseboat that they grew up in.Candice Lemon-Scott was able to capture the feelings of each character through her writing. In every chapter, we can see the overflowing emotions from Gisella and her regrets, or what Trina thinks about their current situation, or what Lauren has been hiding for many years now. But, on the other hand, I felt like the pacing of the story was too slow for my taste and I would have loved it if I have seen more of the twins in the end of the story. But nevertheless, the author's writing was good and very descriptive. You can imagine each and every scene clearly in your head. I personally love reading stories about twins and this book showed the connection between the two protagonists even if they're far apart from each other. Another thing that I liked about this book are the symbolism that the author used for some parts of the story.I think Candice Lemon-Scott tries to connect to some families who have problems communicating what they really feel and what they really want to say to each other. The problem with Lauren and Trina is that after the storm incident, instead of comforting each other, they ignored each other more and more. And Gisella was only a protective mother to her children, but she didn't know how to handle them so she was always strict. Of course, the twins didn't understand this and they didn't bother talking to their mother about it.This story teaches us a lesson that every family should keep in mind. Communicating properly and calmly is not that easy for some, but we should remember that people do things for certain reasons, especially if they don't want to see those their loved ones get hurt.And let me end this review by again giving you one of the lines I loved in the book:\n\"It's easier to be hurt by those you love than by strangers.\"\n - Candice Lemon-ScottThanks to NetGalley for the copy! :)"}, {"userName": "MissSusie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2669943-misssusie", "userReview": "When I finished this book all I could think was Meh that was a waste of my time. I think this could have been a good book, but first you tell us these twin girls had this great bond, then when something awful happens to the one sister the other sister sees it very differently and they pretty much never speak again. In the synopsis of this book it says the truth is finally revealed, well not so much. I also couldn\u2019t understand why as Trina got older why she didn\u2019t see what happened that day differently/truthfully and realize she had hated the wrong person that day. And the ending was so abrupt I wanted to see the reconciliation not this vague did they make up or die I\u2019m just not sure. This book was easily put down it never grabbed me and took me forever to read this very short novella.I\u2019m just going to stop there give it a try maybe you will like it better than I did but for me it was just Meh!1 & 1 1/2 Stars-Meh don't bother not worth your timeI received this from netgalley and the publisher for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Zeta Dina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22650174-zeta-dina", "userReview": "The author introduces us to the family story, the relationship between two sisters and mother. Well-developed story whose facts we find out little at a time. The story tells of what happens when anger overcome common sense and when we do not give the truth to come to light.
