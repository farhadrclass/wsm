No you don't have to remind me its almost one in the morning... Yes i have enough energy to write this review...................... Ahhh i'm awake, i'm awake you don't have to yell...................... Ahh sorry gosh you don't have to get nasty about it i'm just a tired girl trying to write a review..... Fine i won't waste anymore of your time here goes nothing................. I'm not asleep....Okay just had a good cup of coffee and i am now ready to type... Marta big and small by Jen Arena was a great educational book for younger kids seeking to learn a few easy words in spanish such as small, big, tasty, and many more. I don't know a whole lot of spanish so i was glad to add onto my vocabulary. This book was cute and every spanish teacher in the world should own it. This is a fun way to modivate children because pictures always seem to catch their attention. The story was not very long so i cannot realy write a full review like i do for other picture boks but i can say that this book gets four stars for the story.The pictures did not catch my attention in ways that they should have. They were not poorly done but they could have used some work. Yes i know what your thinking...... In every review that you have read by me the pictures have always been judged so harshly.... Thats because in my opinion the pictures are the story and if they are not done perfectly then it drives me insane so the pictures get a one star rateing. Don't look so dissapointed... Oops my phone is ringing...... One second... Hello... No mom i don't need anything from walmart.... I am kind of in the middle of a review....Don't yell at me...... Mom i have to hang up now.... Yes i took my vitamin pills... Bye mom... Yes love you to..... That was my mom she always seems to butt in whenever i am giveing my reviews... Anyways five out of five stars are rewarded to Marta big and small and this story is reccomended to everyone.My Rateing 5/5Hey readers you may have noticed that my review was thrown off topic a little bit this time... Well if any of you have read my Wishing Foxes review then you know i was pretty angry with the whole story concept and was not much fun but i thought i would make up for it in this review.... Yes i know my sense of humor is poor but hey i am practicing you gotta give me credit for that... Until next time! All of you have a GREAT WEEKEND!  -Love Always Britney Kirsten Argueta Reviews"}, {"userName": "orangerful", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/314247-orangerful", "userReview": "This book quickly became a staple in my PreK outreach visits and on regular rotation for my storytimes. Young children love figuring out the meaning of the Spanish words and then we practice saying them together. They all get VERY concerned when the snake shows up and it is hilarious to me that they really think I am going to read them a story about a girl being eaten! You can hear the sigh of relief when I reveal she is hiding in the tree."}, {"userName": "Niki Marion", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26191060-niki-marion", "userReview": "\u2764\ufe0fA bilingual book that presumes an English-speaking reader but doesn't condescend to that reader or diminish the Spanish words that it teaches. It's also a book of opposites and a book of animals, so this picturebook is pulling some major triple duty. And to top it all off, the crowning line of this book highlights cleverness as an inherent quality trait of girls.

The art is bold and active, and I can easily see using this in story time. My many Spanish speaking nannies will love hearing me use the Spanish animal names and adjectives, and the animal movements will be perfect for a bit of kids yoga.

I can guaruntee I'll be using this in storytime.I've read criticisms before that make the argument that presenting two languages in two different fonts can be problematic, especially when one of those fonts is difficult to read. While the Spanish words in Arena's text are in a different font, they're also legible. There aren't full sentences either; the text more seems to be an opportunity to introduce Spanish words to children who might not otherwise be hearing them."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6868015-angela", "userReview": "Marta is many different things, depending on your point of view.
