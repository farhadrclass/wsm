However, you will need to be patient; stay with it and you will be rewarded.A.P. Martin is a social historian who uses his knowledge and experience to good effect. As a backdrop he includes the major events of the time but the real joy of the work is his detail on everyday life in both England and Germany during those difficult times. He also provides a good insight into the political dilemmas of the period, showing how the situation between the UK and Germany was not clear cut with many people believing that Russian Communism was the true enemy.The first part of the book follows the academic John King in Germany. I found this section of the book somewhat dry but I was kept intrigued by the detailed descriptions of life in Germany at that time. It also included a romantic episode which was unrealistic and cheesy.The thriller then comes alive as we follow a second protagonist in his dramatic journey to England. From then on you will struggle to put the book down. Did the writing style and the depth of characters improve or did I just lose my objectivity in the excitement of the plot? Who knows, who cares? Just go with the flow and you will turn the final page contented.I\u2019ve commented on the historical and social detail but the book is not without historical errors. If you spot them you can feel smug, if you do not spot them your life will not be ruined by the misinformation. (A.P. feel free to message me via Whispering Stories if you want more detail).Codename Lazarus is not perfect but it\u2019s a lively spy thriller with an excellent political and social history.

It\u2019s historical fiction at its best, the kind that is thoroughly researched and yet filled with fully developed characters through whom I felt I could experience at least some of what it must have been like in England and also Germany from 1933 to 1940. David King, the protagonist, is a British student in Germany just as Hitler is coming to power. Then in 1938 he returns to Germany just as the persecution of the Jews is escalating. From then on he\u2019s in Britain where for a long time Chamberlain believed Hitler wanted only a small part of Czechoslovakia. The slow brutalization of Germany as well as the slow realization by the British of the scope of Hitler\u2019s ambitions reminded me of The Balkan Trilogy by Olivia Manning, which I strongly recommend. I think we tend to look back at historical events as if they happened at the pace of a movie, one dramatic scene after another, when in fact they unfolded at the same slow pace things are unfolding now\u2014with many conflicting points of view while most people just try to go on with their lives. With the spy business Martin keeps the tension going while the war slowly unfolds, but it\u2019s also a terrific vehicle with which to explore the complexity of human motivations in the caldron of that horrendous war."}, {"userName": "David Lowther", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14288663-david-lowther", "userReview": "Codename Lazarus is a very interesting espionage story set during the last years of the thirties and the early stages of the Second World War.The author has gone to great trouble to ensure authenticity and the sense of time and place is convincing.

We see the unpleasant changes through the eyes of John King, an English academic, whose friends include a Jewish family, the Bernsteins and a young German, Joachim Brandt, who has decided to join the SS.Moving to 1938, King is recruited by his former professor to the world of espionage, in an attempt to foil the efforts of Nazi sympathisers in England. This requires him to cut off all ties with his former life and after another visit to Germany, he must disappear. However his under-cover activities take place in London, where he has to cultivate relationships with British nationals who wish to aid Germany. A significant relationship with a young German nurse, is suspended, but old friends from the past will take a dramatic part in the denouement.This is an exciting plot-driven story and although we gain knowledge of King\u2019s feelings early in the story, he becomes increasingly more distant as other protagonists take a more active part in the storyline. One of the Nazi sympathisers gains our sympathy and we realise that she has trapped herself in a web of deceit. I was especially interested in the vivid description of pre-war Germany and in the realistic account of the evacuation scene at Dunkirk. The final scenes intensify in excitement and are real page-turners, but I was disappointed at the sudden conclusion which left questions about other threads in the book.This debut novel is a fluent tale set in a fascinating time. Plotting and descriptions are sound but the earlier parts of the book lead me to expect greater knowledge of the hero\u2019s emotions and confusion at his use of subterfuge and his abandonment of his friends and family.

John King is a graduate student who is completing two years of research in Heidelberg, Germany. As he and friends gather to commemorate his last days in Germany in 1933, he is saddened that one of his best friends has joined the SS - the Schutzstaffel, paramilitary, surveillance forces under Hitler. His friend, Joachim Brandt, rejects John for socializing with other friends who are Jewish. Joachim becomes angry that John does not show proper deference or respect to Joachim\u2019s new uniform and life choice. From this point on the lives of these young men are on different paths. John helps two half-Jewish friends, Rachel and David, to leave Germany to find careers in Britain while being helped by John\u2019s parents. He later finds their parents in need of rescue and tries to arrange to get them out of Germany to safety.A few years after returning to Britain, John is asked to return to Germany under the guise of \u2018security research\u2019 interests, while observing what he can of German activities. This work expands as John is asked to fake his own death so that he can become an intelligence operative infiltrating the German intelligence network in Britain. The story describes the covert training that John is given and the planning for his accidental death. It then moves to his experiences as he steps into the role of a German Abwehr agent leading several sympathizer cell groups. The story pace picks up in the last quarter. John\u2019s former German friend, Brandt, who has been undercover in America, is reassigned to Britain. His activities set him on a collision course with John's world. David, the other friend whom John helped move to England, has become a cop tasked with investigating the meager leads to a cell leader known as \u201cLazarus\u201d. David is pulled in to help find German infiltrators and his path weaves towards Brandt and John\u2019s tense confrontation. The history is interesting with strong detail of physical settings, as well as social and political sentiments. The author does a good job describing the devastation and fears, first at battle scenes at Dunkirk, and again during the German bombing of London and surrounding communities. The author also portrays the impressive strength and resilience of the British people. The detail makes this story very engaging, if a bit slower in pacing. There were a couple of awkward point of view shifts and stronger editing might have helped to move the story through better action. I was wrapped in the intense climax when the book abruptly ended, leaving me with several questions. This is a worthwhile read, especially for history buffs interested in life-like details of the earlier years of WWII. I also found the portrayed thought processes of the German and Russian sympathizers interesting as it made me more aware how citizens could betray their country with justifications of different political ideologies, including fascism, communism and socialism.

It\u2019s John King\u2019s last day of an eighteen month research stay in Heidelberg. Although he will be sorry to leave his friends, the threatening climate in Germany, the increase in Hitler\u2019s dictatorship and the ensuing violence against Jews only disgusts and horrifies, somewhat neutralising the sadness at leaving. Several years later, John King is a gifted academic with a Doctorate and a major interest in the Second Reich. He is approached by his erstwhile tutor, Professor Pym with an incredible proposition. If John agrees, his life will never be the same but his help would be invaluable to Britain in the fight against Germany.John\u2019s struggles with the constraints of his new role, and the position he finds himself in, are compelling and I enjoyed the danger, intrigue and resulting tension. A very good story with a well thought through plot, which I found extremely interesting. The build up was slow and steady, most of the action takes place in the second half of the book. The author obviously has an incredible knowledge and huge enthusiasm for this period of history, and it shows. The re-creation of certain points, such as the rise of the Nazis and the growing persecution of the Jewish community in Germany, an impromptu execution, the Blitz and the evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk were written realistically and very well done. I liked the way Dunkirk was experienced from the perspective of Joachim Brandt, John King\u2019s erstwhile friend. The feeling of time and place is apparent and the narrative gives an authentic sense and of events.However, I do feel that the narrative needs a little smoothing out, some of the dialogue, a couple of characters and situations were unconvincing, most notably John and Greta\u2019s relationship. Also, I think there was scope for more development of John King\u2019s character.

Apparently it is based on true facts/events although there are no sources/bibliography in my Kindle edition to support this. Maybe an afterword would have been helpful here. Still, I did enjoy this. While most novels about espionage are pretty much action-packed and fast-paced, this one is quite slow in comparison. Admittedly I found the build-up a bit tedious, it did take time until the story got going. Even then the pace is slow but I still had a hard time putting it down; it certainly had me gripped. The ending was a huge disappointment, though. It was so abrupt that I was certain the last pages had been omitted. I'd have appreciated an epilogue. Or will it be continued in a second book??

For that reason, when I came across Codename Lazarus by A.P. Martin, I was unable to resist the temptation to give it a try. And was that ever an inspired choice? Right from the outset I was captivated by the brisk, efficient writing, the meticulous attention to detail, the fiercely authentic milieu, historical and social, in which the story is set. In the early chapters, the author effortlessly encapsulates the rise of Nazi Germany in the late 1930s with an absorbing mix of narrative, dialogue and action. Add to that the author\u2019s erudition, his intimate knowledge of the Germany\u2019s language and culture, and the reader is captivated by a tale that never loses its unmistakeable air of truth.Codename Lazarus is the gripping story of a young English university lecturer whose experience of Germany and his knowledge of the language have made him an ideal candidate for a hazardous, off-the-book, undercover role on behalf of the British Government. There is a slow build\u2013up of tension as the young spy infiltrates himself into a number of groups of British Nazi sympathisers, knowing that one mistake might cost him his life.I suppose I could say that in the first half of the book the excitement is largely cerebral. It is like a living chess-game. Initially nothing appears to be happening as the protagonists ease slowly forward towards their inevitable confrontation, keeping a close eye on the enemy\u2019s moves, making one\u2019s own moves with heart in mouth. As other players enter the fray, the apprehension mounts, and the reader can see the lurking dangers, the possible traps, and all sorts of possibilities for catastrophe, that hover on the fringes of the action as pawns are sacrificed and the opposing forces move closer and closer to checkmate. This book may not have the frenzy of the breakneck thriller, but the taut trepidation which underpins the seemingly calm progress of the novel\u2019s events contains its own gut-clenching brand of suspense. The finale, however, when the key protagonists clash in the thrilling denouement, leaves the realm of foreboding and catapults the reader into real and heart-stopping action.This is a long book that allows the author to look at some of the events of the Second World War, and he often does so with an original eye. His recounting of the horrors of the terrible defeat of the British Expeditionary Force and the miracle of Dunkirk, as seen through the eyes of a German spy who has infiltrated the retreating army, is masterfully conceived. Kudos, also, to the author for eschewing the boring, repetitive, blow-by-blow bedroom couplings that seem de rigueur for the modern novel but which add nothing to the story. Martin\u2019s restrained treatment of the inevitable sexual liaisons that arise, maintains the story\u2019s decorum, and absolutely nothing is lost by this constraint. Codename Lazarus is an utterly absorbing page turner that kept me awake long into a couple of nights until I finished it. It has regenerated my taste for WW2 novels and while I may not be fortunate enough to find writers who can spin tales as brilliantly as AP Martin, I am still encouraged to search for some exciting reads, among which, I hope, will be a new book by this very accomplished writer."}, {"userName": "Julie Ferguson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1224893-julie-ferguson", "userReview": "I read this novel as a publisher's ARC.CODENAME LAZARUS by A.P. Martin is a WW2 spy story. I found it compelling and fascinating because it was believable and well written. It provided insight into pre-war Germany and Britain, as well as the shadowy world of intelligence and espionage. Just how far both sides were prepared to go to gain advantage was astonishing.Without giving away the story, the Brit side was filled with unlikely characters doing dangerous things. Mostly out of academe, they endeavoured to prevent the German sympathisers from channelling info to Berlin. The Germans had to discover what was going on and reorganize the sympathizers.Martin created well delineated characters, fast-paced action, and much tension.

Excellent effort for a first novel and recreated London in the pre-war and Blitz phases very well I thought. The plot was a good spy effort with the English academic Dr John King having to fake his death so he could reappear as a supposed Nazi agent in the UK. This was because it was believed the SIS was infiltrated by the Germans already so a separate operation outside this remit was necessary.

We see developments unfold through the perspectives of three characters: Englishman John King; German Joachim Brandt; and German-Welsh Jew, David Bernstein. Though friends at Heidelberg University, after Brandt joins the Nazi SS, the three take different paths. When they meet again, conflict is inevitable.One of the story\u2019s great strengths is the immersive sense of time and place. Author Martin masterfully recreates the attitudes, speech and tension of life during the 1938-1940 period. John King spends 1938 in Berlin, where he\u2019s befriended by a German military intelligence officer whose greatest hope is that Germany will ally with Britain. King falls in love with the more practical Greta, who fears there can be no future for a couple from countries soon to be at war. In 1939, King returns to England to focus on his anti-espionage work. We witness the first Blitz attack on London in 1940 and the Battle of Dunkirk. All of these scenes are well researched and detailed.My only criticism of Codename Lazarus is the rather abrupt ending, which left questions in my mind.

So far, so promising. If you add in the period of the story - 1933 -1940 - you have a fertile backdrop for an historical thriller.The tension comes with the insertion into pre War Germany of a British agent which is followed by a German coming to Britain post Dunkirk posing as a Canadian.The book's description of Germany as Hitler racked up the anti Semitic rhetoric and abuse is convincing and the buildup of tension towards the denouement was satisfying. However I felt the story had some flat spots in the middle and at times I felt that the author could benefit from the 'show, not tell' line of advice to a writer.If you like the works of Alan Furst and David Downing, as I do, perhaps you will agree with me that this is a superior thriller which could have benefited from some more rigorous editing."}, {"userName": "Judith Barrow", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6302009-judith-barrow", "userReview": "I was looking forward to reading Codename Lazarus for two reasons; that it\u2019s adapted from a true story and that it\u2019s set against the background of WW2, a particular time in history I\u2019m interested in.This is a dense story to read due to the extensive details and descriptions built around the actual plot. I admire the author\u2019s obvious knowledge and research to set the story in both the era and the places the protagonist moves around in. There is a wonderful sense of place.The lead up to the war, the settling in of the plot, although well written and described, is too slow for me, mainly because I didn\u2019t feel I was getting to know the protagonist, John King. I didn\u2019t get any sense, initially, or as the plot progressed, of his emotions at what must have been an extremely tense time. I don\u2019t think his internal dialogue works; a lot of the time the thoughts portrayed were too formalised and revealed nothing of the tension and apprehension of a young man newly learning to survive under cover in an dangerous and threatening situation. And I felt the same about his personal life. The love angle with Greta became instantly too intense and then abruptly dismissed. Although I am aware that such immediate and tempestuous relationships must have happened during wartime, this neither felt passionate or particularly dangerous for either of them, despite them being citizens of countries almost at war with one another.Saying that, as the story progresses , there are other characters who are extremely well rounded, who stand out by the way they are portrayed. And their dialogue is excellent and gives greater insight to them and their part in the plot.All in all, I would have liked the beginning to move at a faster pace; I thought the pacing of the plot in the middle just right; but I would have liked a more gradual lead up to the ending, which felt as though it all came in a rush and finished the story too suddenly.I don\u2019t know if it was the way the novel was downloaded onto my reader but there are times when sentences, dialogues and paragraphs run together where there should be spaces so I ignored that. But there were quite a few punctuation errors.This is a good story. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I felt the protagonist to be too distant from the reader I would have given five stars. A rewrite of only a few places to bring John King/James Kemp to life and another final, tighter edit, would make this an excellent 5* read."}, {"userName": "John Purvis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31181778-john-purvis", "userReview": "\u201cCodename Lazarus\u201d eBook was published in 2016 and was written by A. P. Martin (http://www.apmartin.co.uk). This is Mr. Martin\u2019s first publication. I received an ARC of this novel through https://www.netgalley.com in return for a fair and honest review. I categorize this novel as \u2018PG\u2019 because it contains scenes of Violence and Mature Situations. The story is set in Germany and England during the years 1933-1940. The primary character is history professor Dr. John King. King has spent time in 1933 Germany before Hitler rose to power and left just as the Nazis were beginning to take control of the country. Later in 1939 his old Oxford professor called him in to a secret meeting. The professor had been working for British Intelligence and sought King as a new recruit for a secret mission. King agrees even though the though of faking his own death does not sit well. King returns to Germany to find out more about the ever more powerful Nazis before a well conceived hiking \u2018accident\u2019 in Switzerland renders \u2018John King\u2019 dead. King, now using the name James Kemp, takes the place of an ousted German who has been leading a spy ring in the UK. King works the traitors, gathering information on each of them and their contacts. The Battle for Britain is at its height and all fear that Germany will soon invade. King finds himself the subject of a search by Scotland Yard\u2019s Special Branch and by a real German spy sent into the UK to revive the spy network. I enjoyed the 10.5 hours I spent reading this 365 page World War II Thriller. I liked the time scale that the novel covered. The plot was interesting, though not exactly unique. There was intrigue and a little action, though I think more action would have made this a better read. I also was not happy with the conclusion as it left many loose ends. Perhaps a sequel is planned. The cover art is OK, in line with the Swiss accident. I give this novel a 4.4 (rounded down to a 4) out of 5.

John King, a history lecturer, is invited to become an undercover agent, and, despite the realisation of how dangerous and lonely his life will become, he agrees.What I liked about this book The author clearly knows his subject inside out and, I would imagine, has a great interest in it, as opposed to just having done the research required to produce this novel; you can tell the difference. I feel that A P Martin has an innate understanding of the era itself, and the people who lived within it. The section before the war, when agent King witnesses the 'gathering storm' of Nazi Germany, is excellent, and SS man Joachim Brandt's witnessing of Dunkirk, from the point of view of a German spy, is outstanding. I loved these two parts. I thought the plot was well thought out, generally, and it kept me interested throughout. The understated communication between King and his controller, Pym, was most believeable. The characterisation of Pym and Brandt was particularly good, as was that of misguided informant Abigail Stevenson; Brandt's duplicitous relationship with her was executed very well, as was Brandt's developing character, as he grows from patriot to confirmed Nazi. There's a key scene were he slaughters some POWs, which triggers him off; it's so well done. The build up to the war, with the growing danger in Germany, the differing attitudes to Hitler, and the many theories about his intentions, was fascinating, and gave such insight into how that time must have been for different people across both countries.What I was not so sure about  I found some elements early in the book less than convincing; at the beginning, King is with his friends in Germany in 1933, and everyone speaks in perfectly formed sentences, giving just the right amount of information to the reader; the conversation didn't seem real. I wasn't convinced by the romance with Greta; I found their Christmas together in 1938 not a last idyllic, romantic few days before the war, but a mildly interesting account of activities. Greta never came across to me as a living, flesh and blood woman. However, it was no worse than the depiction of women by some well-known writers of this genre, Jeffrey Archer to name but one. I would urge Mr Martin to seek out a proofreader who knows how to punctuate ~ there are scores of missing or incorrectly placed commas, and the curious placing of quotations marks around proper nouns (eg, 'Lords Cricket Ground'). I didn't find any spelling mistakes or typos, though. The ending. The book just stopped. The main conflict of the plot is resolved, and satisfactorily, but it seemed almost as though the author had forgotten that minor story threads needed resolution, too. I turned the page expecting another chapter, or at least an epilogue, but that was that.This book has much to commend it, hence the four stars; the parts I liked, I liked very much indeed, but I feel it needs a bit of 'sorting out' by a really good editor, perhaps a trimming down and removing of mundane detail, to make it the first class novel it deserves to be. I think lovers of 'old school' sort of spy stories will love it."}, {"userName": "Kent Babin", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59060510-kent-babin", "userReview": "I enjoyed the story itself, but a couple of technical details really disrupted things for me. The first was the over-usage of dialogue tags (always with an adverb). They slowed down the dialogue so much that I ended up just skipping over them. The second was the dialogue exchanges between two characters were often lumped together into one paragraph. It was hard to tell who was speaking and I found myself having to re-reread dialogue to make sure I understood the exchange.Otherwise, a well-crafted tale. The historical details of wartime London seemed accurate and the characters were, for the most part, adequately developed. I wasn't a big fan of King. On the contrary, Joachim seemed more authentic.One thing I wonder about is why so much time was dedicated to Greta and Major Kalz when their impact on the story was non-existent."}, {"userName": "Scott Goossen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4684615-scott-goossen", "userReview": "This spy thriller has a few good points. One of them being the English culture and history is portrayed very nicely. On the negative side, it is written in an extremely amateur and uninteresting manner. One of the most glaring things was that the Englishman could do absolutely nothing wrong and the SS man was a brute from the word go. This made for a very quick deduction as to how things would be going in the book."}, {"userName": "Chris Burslem", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24834953-chris-burslem", "userReview": "The second half of the book improved my thoughts about this novel somewhat. It is a cracking plot but I don't think the author got the best out of it, his language seems at times seems, to me, more suited to a younger reader. I am glad I persevered till the end but feel now there needs to be a follow on to tie up several loose ends which themselves would create an interesting plot line."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82062232-rebecca", "userReview": "I have never read a historical fiction book before, but I was in the mood for something new.
