I've gone back and viewed some of the negative ratings for the first book and if the worst someone can come up with is typos (and there are far less than many of the indie published books in the zombie genre, which is a credit to his publisher) then I think we can declare this series a success. One other reader didn't like pop-culture references in the first one and complained of the \"preparedness\" and references to zombie movies by the main character. I can understand that, but to call it unrealistic is assinine. Max brooks has made the phrase \"zombie survival plan\" a widespread idea and allusions to zombie movies? Have you ever heard of the term homage? Look it up, its french. But I don't want an entire review to be negative comments on other reviews. All three novels have been must reads for me. Because of their price on kindle I have to call these a steal. There are a lot of novellas and cheap work out there in the zom-genre but you won't find one of this quality at anywhere near this pricepoint. Nearest comps in terms of entertainment? JL Bourne's day-by-day series and the late ZA Recht morningstar series, but those don't provide the comedy alongside the gut-wrenching drama. Because my brother is an avid zombie reader as well, and he doesn't have a kindle, I bought the paperbacks new at 12 to 15$ a piece. That should show you how much I believe the kindle price is a steal. The second novel is a good bridge between the first and third but was not my favorite of the series. Like any good series, some books have to do the heavy lifting of moving the plot along to the more entertaining story lines. However, even as a standalone story, this brings the hilarious random thoughts comedy and good-natured ribbing that made the first so unique. It delves into the supernatural without being hokie or over the top.as with Recht and Bourne, you get the feeling the author is former military or was in a military family given the details about military weaponry and the general feel for what military men are like. I hope I can someday write anything that is half as entertaining as this book.

It must also be contagious, because everyone I told, and who went on to read the first book, couldn\u2019t wait to read the next.Michael Talbot\u2019s second journal continues on right where the first left off, and takes you through a hair-raising quest to find a safe haven in the midst of the madness. Just like the first book, you will cringe. You will laugh. You will cry. (Ok, maybe just us girls will cry. You guys can pretend you got something in your eye.)

What they don't know is that the zombie horde is not nearly as mindless as it seems. Unlike other survivors, the Talbot's and the people they travel with are being hunted. At first, Micheal doesn't want to believe this is the case but Tommy's warning becomes dire and his son Justin is starting to show terrible side effects after surviving a zombie attack. How much of Tommy is still human is something they will have to discover, as the Talbots struggle to survive, even as it seems that their son is looking for an opportunity to lead them to their deaths. Can the Talbots stay one step of the zombie plague that is determined to consume them.I actually had to pause before writing this review and not because Tufo's story is particularly complex. He added new elements like zombies being able to move quickly, the dead from Talbot's neighbourhood stalking him and even a zombie/vampire hybrid. This of course helped to raise the level of peril and added a sense of urgency to each step the Talbots tale. I could feel the anguish of Michael when confronted with toddler zombies intent on devouring him. It was symbolic of a loss of innocence, of a way of life which would never return. If only Tufo had focused on these elements of his story but alas that was not to be. When Tufo was not overwhelming the story with puerile commentary about farts and various other bodily functions, the story was like an ism lalapalooza.A Plague Upon Your Family, is easily one of the most offensive books I have read in this genre. Please keep in mind that I have read a lot of shit. There isn't a single ism that Tufo didn't engage in in this story, which makes me wonder why Tufo believes that the pain of marginalized people is appropriate fodder for his second rate offensive comedy? I almost don't know where to begin.We met BT (read: Big Tiny) in Zombie Fallout. He is the only Black man among the survivors and of course, he is big and intimidating because well, aren't all Black men? Michael Talbot vacillates between trying to calm BT's ridiculous, ever-present rage and counting on his physical size and strength. BT is simply angry for the sake of being angry, as all Black men are stereotyped to be. If someone seems even remotely disagreeable to BT, like refusing to drink out of a bottle after he has had a sip from it, it must be because BT is Black. There is no nuance to this character. He is simply a big Black hulk, who doesn't seem to have a sense for his own survival and is dedicated to Talbot's leadership for some reason I cannot even begin to fathom. In fact, when BT isn't ridiculously angry, he spends his time propping up Mike Talbot's leadership and self esteem.Then we have Jen, the sole lesbian of the group. After being described as a waste because of her lack of interest in men in the first book, I suppose it was too much to hope that her character would improve. When Jenn steps in to help Talbot fight off the zombies, she's described as \"a gun toting man-hating lesbian\" (pg 76). It only gets better from there folks. When she is able to move quickly, BT says, \"Who would have thought a lesbian would have that kind of speed?\" (pg. 123) Is there something about homosexuality which denotes that one must move with the speed of a turtle? The line doesn't even make any sense! Lesbians apparently are also more aware as we learned on page 209.\"Do you think lesbians are more spatially aware than your normal female?\" I asked BT. \"I mean they have to put their own furniture together and shit. Use a tape measure to hang shelves, that kind of thing.\" This actually hits the mark of being both sexist and homophobic. Jenn never becomes anything more than a stereotype and in the end, died falling off a truck when Talbot couldn't save her. Normally, I am not happy when the sole member of a marginalized group gets killed off in a story, but in this case, it was an absolute relief because it means a break from all of the homophobia Tufo engaged in.Read More"}, {"userName": "Wendy Lohr", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6445772-wendy-lohr", "userReview": "My Thoughts:Okay, I have to say it: Mark Tufo is bloody brilliant! I freakin\u2019 love this series!!Alright, I\u2019ve got that out of my system now. Let me see if I can do this book justice by reviewing it. Fair warning \u2013 if you have not read Zombie Fallout #1 (read my review), then please go read it first before reading this review. I don\u2019t want to ruin anything for those that have not had a chance to dive into this series yet!So, Mike Talbot and his family managed to narrowly escape Little Turtle in the last book and this book literally picks up where the last one ended. So, action and tension from the very beginning! This book focused even more on the characters themselves and how they began to reveal their various tendencies towards reaction or non-reaction in different situations. Unexpected allies came to the forefront while supposed allies went different directions. So, by the end of this book, the group has not only dwindled in numbers but has shifted in alliances.BT and Jen (yep, I was as surprised as Mike when she made her appearance) actually played more active roles in this book and it was interesting to watch them through Mike\u2019s eyes as they stepped up to the plate time and time again. I gained a lot of respect for both BT and Jen throughout this book. And the interactions especially between BT and Mike were freakin\u2019 hilarious! I lost count of how many times those two had me giggling. I think that\u2019s one of the best things about these books is that even though the situations are creepy, scary, dangerous, and tense, Mark Tufo finds ways to weave humor in that helps to lighten the mood some when it\u2019s most needed. Definitely a much added benefit to this genre!More info about Eliza is revealed in this book and it just makes me shudder even more whenever she makes her appearance. The methods she utilizes to get at Mike and his family and friends are sadistic and cruel, making her the ultimate villain as she plays mind games with Mike especially. I\u2019m really worried about Justin and have no idea how his story is going to go as this series progresses. I really hope it ends okay for him\u2026otherwise that\u2019s going to be devastating for the entire Talbot family but especially for Mike and Tracy. And Tommy\u2026more tidbits were revealed about Tommy, but I\u2019m still not sure exactly what\u2019s going on with him. So, hopefully more will be revealed in the next book!This series has definitely got me very invested in it now and I hope I can get my hands on the rest of the books soon! If you have yet to check out this series, please do! It\u2019s sooo much more than just fighting and killing zombies. It\u2019s about survival, humanity, family, friendships, and so much more. A definite must-read for any zombie lover!"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1947477-linda", "userReview": "[Second I didn't like the way Mike handled the Brandon situation. Yes I understand that his leaving was a needed plot point and that he was going to be the Calvary that came in and saved the day. That was clear from the moment he took off. But I didn't like Mike's words about how he wasn't really family. It seemed out of character for Mike (anyone else see a trend) and he should have swallowed his pride and tried to make Brandon stay. Lastly, what is up with Durgen? Is he a zombie, a vampire, a zombie-vampire, or just messed up like Justin? I really wish that it would have been made clear because I just can't see him still being human with one leg gone and the other all busted up by Mike.

I was pretty stressed out more than once wondering how they were going to get out of the horrible situation they were in, and there were plenty!I love this series. In a zombie apocalypse I'd definately want to be with Mike Talbot. Though he has a knack for getting into bad situations he also has the same knack for getting out of them. Although there are some pretty bad people in this story there's also the story of family, friends and loyalty. There is great character depth, even the ones you briefly know you have definate feelings on them.

I'm a massive fan of the Zombie Fallout series and the author, Mark Tufo. Earlier this year I re-read the first book in the series, Zombie Fallout (read my review here), and always fully intended to go back and re-read the second book in the series too.I read a lot of zombie books (probably 20-30% of my total reading), and I enjoy them all for different reasons, but the main reason I enjoy the Zombie Fallout series so damn much are really the characters. Mike Talbot, the narrator of the story, is one of the most sarcastic and snicker-worthy characters I have ever encountered in a book. Coupled with Tommy, the seemingly clueless boy with his secret guardian angel (who appears to be a famous TV presenter), an evil zombie chick with a goal to destroy the Talbot family and anyone who gets in her way, and probably the most underrated character of the series, Mike's long suffering wife (who is also a firecracker in her own right), Tracy.The action sequences are incredibly well-written - a perfect balance of tension, description and character interaction make them completely visible in the mind, and the zombies are truly terrifying.The story itself moves at a pretty relentless pace in ZF2 as the Talbots and their friends run into some pretty hairy situations, both at the hands of the zombie army that are continually hunting them down, and other humans they encounter on their journey to escape Eliza's clutches. There is also a bunch of extremely likable 'good guys' that save their bacon more than once.It's rare that I re-read a book, and even rarer that I would re-read a whole series. But I will be re-reading ZF3 in the very near future before moving onto the two books in the series I have't yet read, ZF4 and ZF5. The Zombie Fallout series continues to cement itself in my top 3 zombie series of all time.Read more of my reviews at The Aussie Zombie"}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6508739-craig", "userReview": "*potential spoiler alert*While not quite as good as the first book, I found Zombie Fallout 2 to be a fast paced, quick read. A couple of things prevented me from giving it a 5 star rating. The first has to deal with Eliza's origins. Mark Tufo has gone into the realm of impossibility here. I know...I'm reading a book about the zombie apocalypse and I am arguing about realism. It may seem strange, but there is a point where willful suspension of disbelief becomes impossible. For me that point is having a vampire become a lead zombie. I suppose one could argue she is still simply a vampire and only 'controls' the zombies. I just can't wrap my head around the concept.My second problem is harder to explain. In the first story I couldn't stop laughing at the 'toilet' humor. Strangely, in the second book it has begun to get old. I don't laugh as hard at the 32 fart joke. Still, I would highly recommend Zombie Fallout 2 to anyone who enjoys laughter with their horror.

In preparation for this review, I began to write out the grievances so I could remember and thoroughly explain my thoughts when I finished the book; however, it was in writing all that out that I decided to abandon this book immediately.I honestly don't know that I've ever been more torn about a protagonist in any other book I've ever read. I constantly went between respecting Mike and then wishing he would just be eaten by the zombies already. I have decided that I wish the latter, and here's why:**minor spoilers**- Grotesque and morbidly fascinating descriptions of zombie gore, I can handle. I can even handle the explorations of the darker side of humanity with the serial rapist from the first book. What I can't handle are the numerous, lengthy, and detailed descriptions of bodily functions that litter this book. Every ten pages Mike is crapping his pants or farting or peeing on himself or getting covered in his own rope-y snot, then he has paragraphs-long internal dialog about it all. This happened in the first book a lot, too, but I mostly overlooked it. I can't overlook it anymore. If these sections were taken out of the book, I would not be surprised if it were 50 pages shorter. I began to feel like they were only added in to create length because they certainly don't generate any value for the actual storyline. Seriously, how often can one crap or pee their pants or fart or have their sinuses dump themselves and, even if one does, how many times can one philosophize about it? I get that maybe things like that might happen in a situation like this when people are scared out of their wits and their bodies are under stress, but that often? And why dwell on it in excruciating detail like that? Just... yuck. I also find it unbelievable that he and his wife have been married so long, yet somehow deny that the other has bodily functions and are afraid to fart in front of each other or things like that. Really? Maybe that denial is why Mike spends so much time thinking about it all, and I guess it would make sense given how awkward their marriage seems to be (more on that later).- The painfully drawn-out comedy of errors that was the sheriff's office incident was basically when I lost all respect for Mike as a hero and everyone else in his party because they continued to look to him for guidance. I almost stopped reading right then, but decided to give it another chance. I gave up when they got to the motel because I could tell by the way Mike was patting himself on the back about how they'd all coalesced into a group that thinks ahead and plans together that the motel would just be yet another string of bad decisions that would be painful to get out of and make me further lose respect for him and everyone else in his party. By this time, I had learned that any time he was self-congratulatory like that, his thoughts were quickly disproved by their actions. I began to wish that the book was following Alex and his family and April instead of Mike's family.- The weird relationship Mike has with his wife where he demonizes her in one breath but then praises her in the other became caustic for me, as did her contradictory statements and feelings about him. I get that maybe this is supposed to reflect the complicated feelings we might have about our significant others on some level in real life, but I could no longer overlook it because it got to a point where I just didn't understand why they were even pretending to be a couple any longer, which then basically made all the internal dialogue Mike had about saving his \"family\" and how important she is to him come off as lies (both to himself and to the reader). It was confusing and distracting.- Mike keeps talking about how he has \"prepared\" his sons for this kind of thing and he's so proud of that, but he didn't seem to value teaching any of the women in his life how to shoot a gun or defend themselves?? I just don't get it. Even if you feel that guns are a \"man's territory\" under normal circumstances, why wouldn't you make sure EVERYONE IN YOUR PARTY can load each kind of firearm available and shoot with some accuracy to protect the party as a whole?? It's naive to think that somehow all the men are going to survive this whole thing. What are the women supposed to do if they find themselves alone because all the men have died protecting them? We already saw how well that worked out in the gas station with Mike's wife and daughter when they stupidly went off on their own and had no idea how to load or use the firearm they for some reason brought with them--and that even after all that they they still didn't ask to be given education in this area!! Seriously?? They were seconds away from death because they didn't understand how to use the tool that could have easily saved them, yet it didn't occur to them to ask to learn how to use said tool once they returned to the relative safety of the housing compound. It's one thing to be uninterested or \"not believe\" in guns before all this; it's another be uninterested and play the damsel in distress with no way to protect yourself during an actual apocalypse. There is just no excuse for any of this. If the women did show interest it was in a comic relief way. Sometimes it was when the women were alone for the reader's benefit (like the gas station incident), and other times it was right in front of the men (like when Erin was ineptly trying to fend off zombies during the rescue with Paul and had no skill whatsoever) and instead of trying to educate them, the men were like, \"Haha, women trying to use those things is so cute, of course they don't know what they're doing because they're women.\" Really? How is this even along the lines of Mike's past and personality? Would a military person really sit there while that lack of education actually makes them more dangerous to the living (particularly with children in their party) and completely ineffective where protection is concerned? So, apparently all women don't have a clue about firearms by dint of being a woman and that is funny (uh, sorry, but no one has a clue about them, man or woman, until they are formally educated about them), women aren't worth teaching these skills even in emergency situations, and the women don't view themselves as worth educating because men are around to protect them. All of this was so inane I just couldn't get over it. Seriously, in an actual zombie apocalypse, clinging to gender assignments with the whole man-protects-woman thing or the fear of tools like that even to the detriment of your party is completely ludicrous. (And, in case you're wondering, I practice what I preach here, as I have been educated about firearms.)- Why are they putting up with Justin, who has so obviously turned to the dark side?? This is also completely ludicrous, particularly when you consider that Tommy must know what's going on with him. I get that Justin is Mike's son, but he is CLEARLY A THREAT to them, he has done nothing to earn his place with them in a long time, the way Mike is touted in this book you would think he'd maybe figure out that Justin may not be as weak as he is pretending AND that Justin is probably how the baddies who are targeting them are finding them so easily, and Justin has on more than one occasion made his malice toward Mike plain. Like April, I would've gone with Alex, if nothing else to get away from creepy Justin. Or at the very least blindfold Justin and plug his ears or something to try to stop him from giving the baddies information.- It's like the TV show \"Lost\" where they kept adding more and more mysteries and unexplained things and we just had to accept them episode after episode as they compounded. There's Tommy's spirit guide and psychic abilities. There's Eliza the vampire and/or some other male baddie who is stalking Mike and have some sort of vendetta against him. There's Justin (also a vampire now?). There's zombies. Oh but wait there are two kinds of zombies now, some that seem to be from the original H1N1 problem and now some that are also vampires? There's telepathy. There's psychic abilities. I mean, for God's sake. Enough already. I am still mildly curious about what all this means, but rather than torture myself with the rest of these books, I will probably just go read spoilers in other reviews so the mystery will be solved and I am sparing myself from Mike's behavior."}, {"userName": "Amber Young", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28119182-amber-young", "userReview": "I'm going to have to space these books out.

On a personal note, having received a kindle for Christmas I set about finding something to read, for many years I have stuck to the same authors and very rarely been willing to try anything new,I also saw the kindle merely as an avenue to get free books and had no intention of buying any. Having watched The Walking Dead on tv and enjoyed it I turned my attention to Zombie books just as an afterthought, I downloaded many free books and samples of books and worked my was through, each one leaving me un-enamoured and un-inspired. Reaching Mr Tufo's first Zombie Fallout book I read the sample and enjoyed it and then moved on to another book without further thought BUT over the course of the next week I could not get the storyline out of my head and genuinely wanted to know what happened next, I then did one thing I never thought I would do I purchased a book ! I read that book over the course of 2 days - I think \"devoured\" is an apt description I was reading morning, noon and night, life was lived one handed so I could have my kindle by my side, on finishing it I immediately purchased book 2 which I finished before payday! I then would have had to wait a week until I could read book 3, I managed 2 days of torture before begging my partner to pay for book 3, when pay day came bliss I bought the rest of the books available and have had a week of excitement, humour, terror and gore - wow what a journey - and it isnt over yet hurry up with book 6 please Mr Tufo ! - I have recommended these books to my colleagues at work and now three other people are undertaking the same journey - I can't recommend this series of books enough - and now I consider myself a Mark Tufo fan"}, {"userName": "Ryan H", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18433567-ryan-h", "userReview": "Ok, I never write reviews but I just have to for this book! Just to preface my review let me introduce myself. I am a very immature, easily entertained, zombie-story-loving male. I do not read books, but I have a profession that allows me to listen to books all day every day. I devour audiobooks. I entered into this series extremely excited! I found another awesome zombie series with multiple books!!! Yeah... Not so much... Unbelievably, these books are too immature for ME! Go ahead, check out the books I've listened to over the last few years. Check out my ratings on books. I don't hold a very high standard for books that entertain me. I could care less about ANY of the characters in this series. In fact I was actually starting to root for the zombies. Once I noticed how much I really didn't care and how I could predict that the main character was going to either puke, fart, talk about how bad something smells or talk about \"the man code\" I stopped this book and deleted the rest of the series. Literally one of those things happened every 5 minutes or so. Like I said, I don't usually write reviews... Not sure how to end this other than to say \"I wish I would have believed what many of the other reviewers had said. Just stay away. ...

Our hero Michael Talbot and his unique Talbotism's are back, and as before had me rolling on the floor and gasping for breath because I was laughing so hard. Once again I must give a warning not to read this book on public transport because your raucous laughter will result on dirty from fellow passengers.Well that is enough of my Talbot worshipping. What about the story I hear you ask, the plot, the subtle and underlying social message contained within the pages. Firstly if you are looking for the second part of that last sentence then you are going to be looking for a long time. What Mark Tufo delivers is a fast paced story in which action, gore and fantastic one liners abound. There is even a tad of the supernatural thrown in...oh and plenty of zombies. You have got your run of the mill zombies, little kiddy zombies, smart zombies, speedy zombies. You have also have one mightily annoyed supernatural female that is hell bent on wiping Talbot and his companions off the map. Talbot and his companion are hunted were ever they go always running from their zombie groupies."}, {"userName": "Theodore", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8621635-theodore", "userReview": "The second installment of the Zombie Fallout series most definitely did not disappoint. The first title leaves you essentially salivating for more with the way it ended and I can assure you this will do the same. It would appear that the author of these books, Mark Tufo, is a fan of ending these titles at a stage that just leaves you craving for more (I somewhat hope that by the time I listen through all the books the other installment would be out).A number of other characters were brought to the fore here during this book, as well as a number of interesting twists where the zombies are concerned. The entire Talbot family all goes through varying degrees of changes through this one but once again seeing the world through the eyes of Mike Talbot in this post-apocalyptic world is probably the most enjoying part of this. I really do agree with him that he needs to be checked out after all this and I don't particular mean because of the traumatic experience of being hunted by Zombies, clearly his issues are far deeper routed but yet it makes for a HILARIOUS listen."}, {"userName": "S.

Tufo's second installment of Zombie Fallout is not worst in class, but it is nosing down to a 1.5, easy.If something is funny in one of the author's future works, I hope he takes the time to write it funny, and not just let us know it was funny by having everybody in the scene break into a snot nosed laughter.If another Eeyore-like main character is kicking around in the author's creative unconscious, I hope he moves away from a relentless first person focus on that character, and gives readers a break by letting us in on more upbeat, less self centered viewpoints.And as hard as this will be to read, as autobiographical as the MC seems when compared to Tufo's author bio, I hope he takes some time and learns to look beyond himself, to empathize with those looks of boredom he is engendering on other people's faces as he goes on and on, and on about himself."}, {"userName": "T.D.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7942714-t-d", "userReview": "Was a bit thrown by the change in direction and was not sure I was going to like it. However, I love the characters and love the style these books are written in so I persisted and boy I'm glad I did! I really enjoyed this book and was eager to start the next one!This book starts with a real twist taking the story in a completely different direction to the one I thought it was going. As I said, at first I wasn't sure because I liked the direction I thought it was heading. However, this new, seemingly random twist gave the books a new and original turn to the usual zombie tale and that made it fascinating. As in the first book the characters are well written and you care about then deeply. The dry humour continues to ground the story, making it feel not only possible but very real. I truly loved this book and would recommend to anyone, whether they enjoy the genre or not."}, {"userName": "Viking", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12243268-viking", "userReview": "OK,when I was reviewing the first book in this seriesI made acomment about simmilarities with other post appocolyptic fiction, namely The Passage I made a comment about Zombie Fallout having nothing to do with vampires.

They meet a few interesting people along the way and encounter a new type of zombie. Well, these zombies have a new ability, sort of. I like how the author made this a little creepier with Justin's situation along with how much Tommy knows to inner fights with Mike and his \"2nd self.\" I'm not 100% sure why Eliza is \"hunting\" Mike. I don't feel this is portrayed as well. Maybe it's not supposed to be? I just feel there should be a definite reason why Mike is the target. Is it because he denied coming with her in the previous book? Maybe we'll find out in the stories to come. Overall, I loved the action and the humor.

With them are Brendon, Nicole\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and Tommy previously a Wal-Mart door greeter who may be more than he seems. Together they struggle against a ruthless, relentless enemy that has singled them out above all others.\tThe Talbots have escaped Little Turtle but to what end, on the run they find themselves encountering a far vaster evil than the one that has already beset them. As they travel across the war-torn country side they soon learn that there are more than just zombies to be fearful of, with law and order a long distant memory some humans have decided to take any and all matters into their own hands. Can the Talbots come through unscathed or will they suffer the fate of so many countless millions before them. It\u2019s not just brains versus brain-eaters anymore.
