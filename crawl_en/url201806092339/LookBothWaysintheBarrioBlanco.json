Jacinta is feisty and argumentative, jealous and scared and lonely, wrestling her way through the tangles, sorrows, and hard truths of the life she was born to.

Her tenuous family life tells a story of the Mexican diaspora experience in the United States, one that seems ubiquitous but also very particularly situated. Just as her mother, battered and desperate, crosses \"la linea\" in a attempt to return home to a crumbling family, Jacinta's father is arrested and presumably deported. While depression sinks in at the loss of her father, and the mistreatment he endures as an illegal immigrant, Jacinta is confronted with her own responsibilities and privileges in the face of the internal polarities her shared identity creates. Her sister, Rosa, is awakened even further to their otherness as Mexican-American U.S. citizens when she returns there for Abuelita's funeral, as she is told that she and her family are rich Americans who are obligated to send money back to their impoverished extended family. In dialogue, Jacinta is shocked to think that she is neither Mexican, nor American. Rosa begins, stating, \"We are not Mexicans.\" After Jacinta responds with a disbelieving, \"You're lying...We're not rich!,\" Rosa reminds her, \"We are not Americans.\" \"W-where do we belong?,\" asks Jacinta. The truth of this crushes her, of being neither and certaintly not both, echoing in the now hollow spaces her unreconciled polarity.So it is from the untethered, tenuous space of an unhinged self that Jacinta is envious, resentful, and aggressive. She is ungrateful of the mutually self-serving relationship she covets with Miss, the Amiga whom she clings to and loathes. Miss is equally manipulative, taking Jacinta on in a mentor/mentee relationship out of guilt and an obligation to \"save\" the little girl she exploited in her micro-aggressive news stories. While Miss wields her privilege and power as a white American and local celebrity to provide Jacinta and her sister with unrecognizable opportunities, the risks she takes and the losses she faces continuously translate into condescending assimilationism. Jacinta understands intuitively, narrating, \"I wanted to tell Angelica that rich white ladies become Amigas to make themselves feel good, not because they care about us. I wanted to tell her that they aren't really brave or strong. They just seem that way, because there's nothing in their world to be afraid of\" (240). Indeed, her profound insight proves both reactive and reflective when taken in consideration with the ways she herself is perceived by her uncles in Mexico. Fear and loss, it seems here, are begrudgingly relative and insidiously universal, though not universalized.As for Jacinta and her apparent lack of grace and gratitude, I think it is from the most underprivileged, oppressed populations that we expect the most of those challenging qualities. Are we concerned about Miss's gratitude for Jacinta in making her \"soft\" story on teen pregnancy, for which the child was neither? What educational opportunities did the mentor squander and waste, while Jacinta was expected to show humble desperation while crumbs of a better life sprinkled all around her, in mock service to making this country a safe place for all to live comfortably in the potential multiplicity of one's identities? Might it be that in her marked rejection of that biased expectation to perform gratefully as the \"other\" that resistance, resilience, and subversion occur most profoundly? If this is true, than Jacinta stands as a hero of democracy at its most crucial time."}, {"userName": "Cc", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5651774-cc", "userReview": "Good to read this from the children's point of view.

Jacinta is working on a picture frame for a Mother's Day gift, and Kate is reporting on teen pregnancy. When Kate accidentally ruins Jacinta's project, she feels bad about it, and Jacinta is quick to jump on this and ask if Kate (or \"Miss\", as she calls her) will be her Amiga, a sort of Big Sister mentor. Kate, a struggling single mother of two boys Jacinta's age, doesn't want to get involved, but is soon taking Jacinta to the local rec center to swim, and signing her up for gymnastics and French programs. Jacinta's home life is not good-- her mother has gone back to Mexico to care for her dying mother, and the family doesn't know when she will be back. Jacinta and her older sister, Rosa, must care for their baby sister Suelita with the help of their Tia. Tia has her own problems-- the father of her three children is a drunk, and is soon deported. While Jacinta is plotting to visit Kate's house, befriend her boys, and see if Miss will buy her things, she also has to deal with her father being deported and the family being evicted from their apartment. For a while, Jacinta is angry with Kate because she asks the girls to live with her, and Jacinta is jealous of Rosa, but when Jacinta's mother calls from New Mexico, where she has made it over the border with a coyote who has stolen her money, Jacinta calls Kate for help once again. Strengths: It's good to see a book that addresses the not-so-subtle change between being in one neighborhood and another in a fairly small town, and the differences between trying to scratch out an existence as an illegal immigrant or as a single mother. Like Gaby, Lost and Found, this portrays a family in an impossible situation, and there are no easy answers. The cover art reminds me very strongly of stories about Hispanic Americans in the reading textbooks we had in the 1970s, somehow.Weaknesses: Jacinta is not nice at all. Yes, her situation is difficult, but she mistreats everyone around her, including her sister, whom she hits in the face and scars! Kate ends up losing her job and having a lot of horrible things happen to her because she mentored Jacinta. Not sure what message this is meant to send!What I really think: I will probably buy this. Students like detestable characters more than I do, and I have a large number of Hispanic students and not enough books that reflect the variety of experiences in the US. I have one girl especially who is always asking for more books, and she will be glad to get this."}, {"userName": "Marika Gillis", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/778088-marika-gillis", "userReview": "Through a series of haphazard incidents, middle-schooler Jacinta manages to weasel her way into the heart of adult news anchor, Kate, who reluctantly becomes her mentor. Jacinta's family is in the country illegally. Her father works all the time and her mother is back in Mexico caring for her sick grandmother. This means Jacinta and her older sister often spend hours alone caring for their younger sibling. Keeping this information from mentor Kate is difficult, especially when Jacinta's father does not return after work one night. This book had a powerful affect on me, an affect that is undoubtedly influenced by my very white life in my very white neighborhood, teaching in a school of predominately Hispanic students, many of whom are illegal immigrants. As I read the book, the stories of my students echoed back from the pages, and I felt like this book might be one with which they could really relate.Then I heard from an adult Hispanic reader that this book was a terrible representation of her culture and she would hate to have children read this story and think this was how they were portrayed in literature. She did not like the character of Jacinta, who admittedly was self-absorbed and a bit obnoxious. I, however, found Jacinta's innner dialogue and turmoil to be indicative of the real feelings middle school children have as they begin to realize that the world is bigger than themselves. She also didn't appreciate the implications that Jacinta's older sister might be tempted to engage in activities that may lead her to an early pregnancy, also a situation that rang true in the stories I hear. My feelings about this book have not changed. I believe it is important to read and hear the stories of children who are in the country illegally, to understand and empathize with their fear and confusion. And I definitely want kids to read these stories too. I think it is an important book, especially in this day and age. But that's just coming from me, and my opinion might not matter as much as others."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/343908-elizabeth", "userReview": "So moving! Do not let the reading level/recommended age fool you. This is a realistic book about culture clash. I am recommending this book to adults. If you desire any sense of what the Mexican immigration experience feels like from the point of view of the children, this is the perfect book for you. This is told in the first person voice of Jacinta. Through a chain of circumstances, a famous white woman becomes her mentor. How they misjudge each other and how they determine what is really important make for a beautiful story. Both of these individuals are enriched by learning from one another. (I love how Jacinta becomes fluent in FRENCH!) Jacinta's dialogue is snapping, angry, tense. It is perfect for the stressful situations she finds herself in. Also, she is still an immature 12 year old girl despite being called on to be an adult far too often!

I read a few other reviews before beginning this book. Although I agree that in some ways Jacinta is not a very sympathetic character, in most ways she is a typical twelve year old who has had quite a few challenges in her life and is doing the best she can. She experiences a lot of growth throughout the book, and in the end I really was cheering for her.I had to trust that the author is giving us an accurate portrayal of what life might be like for a kid in Jacinta's position. I recently tried to read Hour of the Bees and was disappointed to find that the author did not seem to do a good job of portraying a young girl from Albuquerque, or the setting she chose. Rose's author blurb on the jacket would indicate she has worked with disadvantaged girls and is familiar with the region she set her book. I would love to read a book told from Rosa's POV.

In case you missed the clear parallels, their names have almost identical alliteration patterns and have the exact same amount of syllables in each name. Also, JRR has a B.A. in Broadcast Journalism, while KDD\u2019s character is a broadcast journalist. I had a hard time trying to figure out why Kathryn Dawson Dahl did anything for Jacinta's family. I kept wanting her to do something out of love and kindness, but it seemed like most of her actions were out of guilt and obligation. It was guilt that inspired her to buy Jacinta a new picture frame after KDD had ruined it. The book first mentions obligation when Jacinta is talking to KDD about how \u201cthe Mexican Primroses are taking over\u201d the garden. This is what follows:\u201cYou don\u2019t like them?\u201dShe studied my face, then smiled. \u201cActually, I do. They can survive anything. The others are too much trouble.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you pull them out?\u201dShe shrugged. \u201cOnce you take on something, you feel obligated.\u201dA thought came to me. If I\u2019d known the word, I\u2019d have said it was a premonition. A hint of time when I might be too much trouble, and Miss would still feel obligated.There is a consistent thread of obligation in KDD\u2019s involvement with Jacinta and her family. KDD makes it a point that she only signed on to be Jacinta\u2019s Amiga for one year while she\u2019s waiting to see if she can go back to the nightly news. Sometimes, it even seemed like KDD went out of her way to help Jacinta more because she wanted to flex her own muscles than because she actually wanted to help Jacinta\u2019s family, probably because she got demoted from the nightly news and needed recognition to feel validated. Even when KDD decides to drive down to New Mexico to pick up Jacinta\u2019s mom, she finds every excuse to not help: \u201cI\u2019m about to do a newscast! Do you know how long I\u2019ve waited for this?...It\u2019s too dangerous...There\u2019s a story in the news about a guy who went to jail for driving illegals across state lines...We\u2019ll call a lawyer tomorrow...I\u2019ve got my boys to think about.\u201d KDD may go out of her way to help Jacinta\u2019s family, but it\u2019s always out of obligation or guilt or to be seen as a hero. She never goes out of her way to learn about where Jacinta comes from. She seems to always brush off anything Jacinta tells her about her culture, which brings me to my next point.The author continually portrays Jacinta, her family, and Mexicans in general, from a deficit-based perspective. An example of this is the author\u2019s characterization of Jacinta\u2019s world as a \u201csmall world.\u201d Just because Jacinta and her family don\u2019t take gymnastics lessons at the rec center or French lessons at the community college, it doesn\u2019t mean their world is small. Lack of access to institutions doesn\u2019t necessarily mean their world is small. KDD (AKA JRR) fails to recognize how Jacinta\u2019s family\u2019s connection to Mexico makes her world much bigger than KDD\u2019s world to begin with. KDD (AKA JRR) clearly has no idea that Jacinta actually lives between 2 worlds and is developing a much more complex understanding of these worlds. The author highlights Christmas with the Dahl family, but doesn\u2019t talk about how beautiful Christmas can be in Jacinta\u2019s family, or Easter, or other holidays. JRR presents one side of a stereotype of Mexicans by having KDD say \u201cWhat were your parents thinking? You know what it\u2019s like in Mexico. Drugs. Kidnappings.\u201d JRR, however, never provides a positive or culture rich perspective of Mexicans.The way the author portrayed Jacinta\u2019s language learning throughout the book was annoying more than anything else, so I\u2019m not going to go into how it aligns or doesn\u2019t align to various theories of language acquisition.Overall, I began reading this book with an open mind, but ultimately decided I'd much rather have a white lady write about her own experience mentoring \"at-risk\" youth than to have her write from a Mexican girl's perspective pretending to know what it feels like."}, {"userName": "Brenda Mena-Sierra", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75867488-brenda-mena-sierra", "userReview": "I enjoyed that the author gave insight of the true struggles the Hispanic community goes through and the affects that some of the struggles cause on families."}, {"userName": "Elie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16647895-elie", "userReview": "Jacinta is a middle school girl who lives in a small community of Mexican immigrants, many of whom are undocumented. At her youth center, she manages to get a news anchor to be her mentor. She struggles to find out who she really is, who she wants to be, and what family means to her. This book caught my attention because the protagonist is similar to the middle school students I teach, most of whom are from Mexico as first- or second-generation immigrants. I was right for the most part: this book really does speak to that often-overlooked demographic. While the author isn't Mexican herself, she writes a lot of truths about the Mexican-American experience: poverty, child-care, truancy, code shifting and vocabulary, fear of deportation, torn families, tight families, and fear of the police. It is important for kids to see themselves in the stories they read, and this book could really speak to them. As an adult reader, I had some issues. The biggest is that I didn't like any of the characters. Jacinta is not nice and is jealous of everything. She is very self-centered. Those characteristics makes her appear immature. She grows out of some of these issues at the very end, but she is largely unpleasant. Miss Kate is Jacinta's Amiga mentor, like a Big Sister. I disliked Kate even more. She doesn't seem to want to be Jacinta's Amiga and rarely seems happy to be spending time with her. At one point, she gives Jacinta and her sister Rosa purity rings so that they stay away from boys. Abstinence-only education has been proven ineffective, yet this jaded woman throws rings at the girls and tells them to stay away from boys. This sounds like the author is pushing her beliefs on the reader. At another point, when Jacinta is talking about going to Mexico, Kate says, \"You know what it's like in Mexico. Drugs. Kidnappings.\" What the heck? Jacinta doesn't even argue with her, as if in agreement. That sounds pretty racist to me. Jacinta has a rough relationship with her \"best friend\" Angelica, but they are constantly awful to each other. No wonder Jacinta doesn't have any friends. Again, the \"mi Amiga es mejor que tu Amiga\" is something elementary-aged kids would squabble about.

Their journey was an amazingly uphill climb and yet they did it anyway.It appears that the book is written by the equivalent of \"Miss\" - and I would love to hear from her two \"mentees\" who apparently offered at least some of their stories as fodder for this novel.

I never asked myself if two people as different as Miss and me could ever really be amigas. When Jacinta Juarez is paired with a rich, famous mentor, she is swept away from the diapers and dishes of her own daily life into a world of new experiences. But crossing la linea into Miss\u2019s world is scary. Half of Jacinta aches for the comfort of Mam\u00e1 and the familiar safety of the barrio, while the other half longs to embrace a future that offers more than cleaning stuff for white people. When her family is torn apart, Jacinta needs to bring the two halves of herself together to win back everything she's lost. Can she channel the power she\u2019s gained from her mentor and the strength she\u2019s inherited from Mam\u00e1 to save her shattered home life?", "title": "Look Both Ways in the Barrio Blanco", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22747826-look-both-ways-in-the-barrio-blanco", "average": 3.79, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415581840l/22747826.jpg", "reviews": 48, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8562519.Judith_Robbins_Rose", "name": "Judith Robbins Rose"}], "type": ["Childrens", "Realistic Fiction", "Fiction", "Contemporary", "Childrens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22747826-look-both-ways-in-the-barrio-blanco"]}
