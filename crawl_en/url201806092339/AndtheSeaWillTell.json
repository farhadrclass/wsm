Like Helter Skelter, Bugliosi's egotistical style of writing is hard to get past but it was cool to read this after Helter Skelter because in this trial he was a defense lawyer. The first half is unbelievable and shocking. The second half is a snore. Great mystery with an ending that leaves you VERY unsatisfied.

It however, fall far short of my expectations. I had 3 main issues with it. 1) the write up on the back cover indicates that Bugliosi solves the mystery and pieces together what happened.. he pieces together a conjecture of what happened...don't expect this solved 2) there were too many descriptions of the case and trial that seemed self serving to an arrogance of what a \"great\" lawyer Bugliosi was 3) I was left with a lingering sense that Bugliosi a)outright concealed the truth, b)skewed the truth, or c) was a fool.. none of these sat well with me. It did not escape my notice that after the high profile prosecution case of the Manson Murders that a high profile defense case would be an extra special feather in his cap... I don't think his motives for taking on the case were as altruistic as he presented. Good points of the book: it was very interesting, behind the scenes life of a case and trail were interesting, book has a great sense of an eerie atmosphere. Ironically, I think the best thing about this book is the things that are unsaid..some things couldn't be written in black white by these authors.Read between the lines, and this book becomes much more interesting."}, {"userName": "J.H.

It's about the Palmyra murder case, which I'm extremely interested in, and it was written by Vincent Bugliosi, who became one of my all-time favourite writers after I read Helter Skelter, which was brilliant.Sadly, this book is not brilliant.The first part was really interesting, as it starts before Mac and Mutt Graham and Buck and Jennifer head to the supposedly deserted island. I found the details of their lives on the island fascinating.Unfortunately, the second (and longest) part of the book is all about the trial, and seems mostly to consist of Bugliosi bragging about what a great lawyer he is and taking us behind the scenes of his process. Maybe some found this interesting, but learning that he writes everything out on a yellow legal pad was not my idea of a riveting read.He must be an incredible lawyer, though, because I never once thought that his client, Jennifer Jenkins, was innocent of Muff's murder, and yet, he got her off. The only proof of her innocence appeared to be Bugliosi insisting that his instincts told him she \"must\" be innocent. Even he didn't sound fond of her--she comes across as an unlikeable, difficult client and a pathological liar with a thing for thugs.The fact that she was so broken up over Mac and Muff's disappearance that she immediately moved into their boat, ate their food, and helped herself to Muff's clothing seems despicable to me. I can't imagine wearing a dead woman's clothes, even if that woman had passed away in her sleep.I gave this three stars only because the first section was great."}, {"userName": "Jim Thomsen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2705156-jim-thomsen", "userReview": "Every bit the equal of Bugliosi's \"Helter Skelter,\" this book is a comprehensive ripper of a true-crime yarn that feels structured like an Agatha Christie tale. To wit: Four people are on a remote, even spooky South Pacific island named Palmyra. Two, a married couple, disappear and are presumed dead. The other two \u2014 a hippie with a murky criminal past and his maybe-not-as-naive-as-she-seems girlfriend \u2014 turn up months later in Hawaii with the boat belonging to the vanished couple. The man is found guilty of murder nearly a decade later, after the bones belonging to one of the missing turn up. But was the other guilty as well? Bugliosi, who switches to the defense table in this tale, insists that she isn't. He does a good job of convincing a jury nearly two decades after the slayings ... but will you be convinced as well? You'll have fun trying to put together the pieces of the bizarre true 1970s and 1980s story of Paradise Found \u2014 and Paradise Lost. It's a story in which physical evidence, by necessity, must take a backseat to circumstantial offerings and character assessment. And being readers, we love to judge. And put our wits against those of Bugliosi, who is one of the sharpest legal minds in American crime. He makes his case, lays out all the facts, put his own spin on them ... but never tries to unfairly prejudice anyone's opinion. No, his prejudices are there \u2014 but fairly and honestly rendered \u2014 and that's what ultimately keeps the reader in the game amidst an intimidatingly high stack of facts and suppositions. Good fun, good story, good storytelling. \"And The Sea Will Tell\" is another in my short stack of books I know I'll read again and again."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/898529-lisa", "userReview": "This book is not just a true story, but it is comprised of actual journal entries.

While visiting my best friend and neighbor, Gerri, there was a frantic knocking on her door. The woman standing on the porch said she needed to use the phone and that it was a dire emergency. We could see a large yacht anchored offshore and a dinghy beached on the primitive landing that local fishermen used to launch their skiffs. We asked if that was her boat and she said yes and that an emergency had required them to anchor and seek a phone which the neighbor nearest the landing told her that Gerri had. My husband worked for Gerri's husband who had a small house painting business and they had one of the only phones in the village. The woman said it would be a collect call and Gerri led her to a back bedroom where the phone was and she closed the door. Several minutes later the woman came out of the bedroom and ran out the door back to the dinghy which we watched her row back to the yacht. 3 days later we saw the woman's picture on the front page of the Honolulu newspaper; she and her boyfriend had been arrested for stealing the yacht from a remote island in the South Pacific about a thousand miles away from Hawaii!After Vincent Bugliosi left the L.A. DA's office he went into private practice. One of his cases was the defense of Stephanie Stearns who along with her boyfriend, Buck Duane Walker, was accused of murdering Mac and Muff Graham on a remote atoll in the Pacific called Palmyra. The couple was arrested for stealing the Grahams' boat 3 months after the Grahams' had disappeared in 1974. Stearns got 2 yrs for the theft and Walker got a 10 yr (+ 5 for the Ecstasy sales) sentence but escaped prison in Washington State and was recaptured in 1981. 1981 was not a good year for Buck Walker as that was also the year the dis- membered and mutilated remains of Muff Graham were found in a metal box washed up on a beach on Palmyra...the two then faced murder charges. They had separate trials with Walker having a public defender and Stearns' affluent family hiring Vincent Bugliosi. Walker got life and Bugliosi got Stearns aquitted. There is not a doubt in my mind that this woman was just as guilty as her boyfriend. She said she had no knowledge of any part of the crime but how are you one of only four people on a deserted island that doesn't hear a chainsaw or gunshots or many other things that apparently happened on the day of that murder?? Bugliosi was a great attorney. He was a narcissistic man, of that there is no doubt...and a very long-winded and self-serving writer. Without the help of his co-authors of both Helter Skelter and this book neither would have made very enjoyable reading. He changed Stephanie Stearns name to Jennifer Jenkins in the book...to protect her innocence? He definitely knew his way around the criminal justice system and the law. I'd hire him in a heartbeat if I was charged with murder if he was still alive today.I don't believe he really gave a damn if she was innocent or not, but was only interested in winning his case.Walker was paroled in 2007 because of poor health and moved to Willits California where lived in a small trailer outside of town. He wrote a book called Palmyra: True Story of an Island Tragedy, in which he asserted he was having an affair with Muff and that when Mac caught them in the act he had to kill him in self-defense. He died of a stroke 2 years later before his book was published. I believe it was finally published in 2015.Stephie Stearns lives in Hawaii, a free and \"innocent\" woman.Vincent Bugliosi died in June of 2015 at the age of 80 and his legacy lives on ...no matter what you thought of him.To me this is a much more interesting true crime story than Helter Skelter... but meeting one of the perpetrators of the crime has probably swayed my judgement."}, {"userName": "William Tatsch", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17847431-william-tatsch", "userReview": "This is a dichotomy of a book; the first half (presumably written by the second author) is enjoyable and everything you could want in a true crime book - if only he could have written the whole book. The second half of the book was a trudge to read; The trial sequence part of the book is usually one of my favorites, but I found I had to make myself read it here. I think the biggest problem with this book arises out of my expectations going in, which I concede may not be a fair way to judge the book. I was expecting a neutral, fact-based telling of the story from beginning to end, but the second half of this book is anything but neutral. In fact, while it purports to be the story of a murder on Palmyra Island, it seemed to me to be a vehicle for Vince Bugliosi to celebrate himself at the expense of anyone else mentioned in the book, including his client. (As an aside, I don't believe that he actually said half the things he said to the judge in this case, and I think he was a bit deluded about his client's character.) In short, in my opinion, I found Vince Bugliosi to be one of the most self-serving, pompous, biased, annoying, and self-aggrandizing characters, let alone authors, I have ever seen. He definitely put me off of this book. In fact, I bought Helter Skelter at the same time I bought this book to read, but I don't want to put myself through another Vince Bugliosi self-worship session, so I think Helter Skelter is going to Half Price Books at my earliest convenience along with this book.

Admittedly I did skip about 200 pages in the middle to avoid the risk of my own suicide and went straight to the verdict of the trail- which btw was NOT GUILTY- yawn.

He is arrogant and constantly berates his client, which I found particularly egregious considering taking a plea deal--one of the things they clashed over--seemed quite sensible. Not to mention it was suggested by his long suffering co counsel, who is clearly the voice of reason in the duo and often has to work behind Bugliosi's back.That said, it's hard to imagine a truly effective defense attorney in particular with a different personality. If anything can be said for good old Vince, it is that he is passionate and prepared down to the last detail. If I'm ever falsely accused of something, I'm dialing his number first.And the proof is in the pudding; he gets his client acquitted. Personally I think Jennifer is either a sociopath or unforgivably stupid and naive. At the very least her emotional responses are often stunted and inappropriate, a fact noted by Bugliosi himself. For example, after her brilliant hardworking attorney has just given the performance of a life time and won her her freedom, she spends the celebratory dinner afterwards criticizing such minutia as the color of his tie and how his hair is combed,Personally, I doubt very much that she's completely innocent. But that's not the standard we hold defendants to in the U.S. For that reason I feel that Bugliosi championed the proper result: acquittal. Without anything definitive to show that she knew about the murders, she has a right to her freedom. I am sorry for Mac and Muff, because they sound like interesting people, if a bit judgemental towards people who don't live their highly privileged lifestyle. Muff's feelings about the trip (a deep sense of foreboding) only drive home the point that many true crime books do, that people should in general trust their instincts. How many lives would be spared if those people had just given weight to their instincts?I also found the trial details and the workings of a defense case fascinating.. Knowing how and why certain arguments are made was illuminating and riveting. I especially appreciated that each argument was laid out in the back of the book. However, I felt that Bugliosi made several huge missteps. Keep in mind I am not a lawyer, and hell, he won so he obviously did something right. However, he spends a long time asserting that Jennifer may not have heard gunshots thanks to the noise of the fauna on the island and the rushing of the wind and water. But after making this perfectly serviceable argument, he speculates that Mac and Muff's bodies may have been cut up with a chainsaw! Well shit, it's likely she would have heard a chainsaw, right? Luckily for him nobody seems to have picked up on this. He also invokes Hitler and Eva Braun to make a point, which I thought would automatically lose people. That aside, it's a good book.

Deprived of adult supervision and having to fend for themselves in order to live, it didn't take them long to revert to barbaric practices, turn on each other and descend to murder. I told myself that was fiction, and now I read this book based on a true crime.Once I started reading the book, there was no way I'm going to put it down. I was so engrossed by the story, I carried the book everywhere I went. Fascinated and repelled, I couldn't believe this happened in the 20th century, in an island that, although isolated, is within the control of the mighty U. S. of A. Murder perpetrated by a man and a woman who are in full possession of their faculties, are not being coerced by anybody. Then there is an opportunistic lawyer who also profited, indirectly, from their crime. I don't think OJ ever read this book, but his lawyers certainly did.

Simpson Got Away with Murder, so even though I'd been warned that this one wasn't nearly as good, I decided to give it a shot. Bugliosi has his problems, no doubt, his overweening ego being chief among them. He has one of the biggest heads I've seen in law (and as a lawyer myself, I've seen some that could rival the Goodyear blimp), but at least he's put in the hours to earn the rep. So I can kind of take a deep breath and skim past those parts. Ali had won a few fights before announcing \"I'm the greatest!\", so to speak. And then this. THIS. The first part, no doubt written by the co-author, read like a novel and was very interesting and enjoyable. It could not have been written by Bugliosi, because it was in this part of the narrative where Jennifer's complicity, at least passive if not as an active participant, became clear. As legal maneuverings commenced, no matter what Bugliosi said, her guilt and what I would speculate is her sociopathic personality soon was as obvious as getting hit in the face with one of the infamous sharks from the lagoon. As difficult as it may be for those who have only read this book and not the two I mentioned earlier to belief, Bugliosi is actually a very good, intelligent attorney, and an excellent investigator. Why regarding this particular client he suddenly turned stupid and broke all the most basic rules of a criminal defense attorney, of ANY attorney, legitimately baffles me. After much discussion with the person who recommended the book to me, who is also an attorney, we have come to the conclusion that all of his bluster about believing in the innocence of this criminal mastermind must have been added later, as it was more palatable than his real reason. She was so clearly, obviously, blindingly guilty, that he wanted to see if he, The Great and Powerful Oz, could successfully fool the munchkins into letting a homicidal maniac go free. He'd do everything else he'd set out to do in his career and there were no challenges left; why not try something new and different?But of course he couldn't put that in the book, so he went back and white washed his motives later, even knowing it would make him look willfully blind or inept at reading character. Better that than the truth, in this case. Apparently there is a rebuttal book that is only available in e-book format that I am going to be hunting down, but in the mean time, I am seriously disappointed in Bugliosi. I had planned to read the rest of his books, but now I don't know if I will. If I do, I'll at least read the one where he's on the prosecution side, and he doesn't feel the need to dress up his motives.

It is fascinating and intriguing, and Bugliosi is a fantastic writer. Some of the other reviews complained that the mystery isn't solved, but this isn't a book about solving the mystery, instead, it is the account of the defense and the main character's trial. I also like that the author avoided too much lawyer jargon and wasn't pretentious about his side of the story. Now, he does insert a lot of cues and statements to lead you to where he wants your thinking to go during the trial (he wants the reader to understand exactly what the courtroom \"felt\" like and how his thought process was going).

Two couples, each expecting to have the island to themselves, are from comepetely different backgrounds. Only one couple leaves the island as the other couple is murdered. The author is also the defense attorney for the female half of the surviving couple. The 1st half covers the crime and the 2nd half covers the trial. Vincent Bugliosi does an excellent job of explaining our U.S.A. justice system while interestingly explaining the difference between innocent and not guilty while reminding the reader that the burden of proof is 100% on the shoulders of the prosecution and that citizens are innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasoable doubt. He held my interest very well.He also wrote \"Helter Skelter\"."}], "description": "Alone with her new husband on a tiny Pacific atoll, a young woman, combing the beach, finds an odd aluminum container washed up out of the lagoon, and beside it on the sand something glitters --a gold tooth in a scorched human skull. The investigation that follows uncovers an extraordinarily complex and puzzling true-crime story. Only Vincent Bugliosi, who recounted his successful prosecution of mass murderer Charles Manson in the bestseller Helter Skelter, was able to draw together the hundreds of conflicting details of the mystery and reconstruct what really happened when four people found hell in a tropical paradise. And the Sea Will Tell reconstructs the events and subsequent trial of a riveting true murder mystery, and probes into the dark heart of a serpentine scenario of death.", "title": "And the Sea Will Tell", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/431321.And_the_Sea_Will_Tell", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348769981l/431321.jpg", "reviews": 310, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/28828.Vincent_Bugliosi", "name": "Vincent Bugliosi"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45976.Bruce_Henderson", "name": "Bruce Henderson"}], "type": ["Crime", "Nonfiction", "Mystery", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/431321.And_the_Sea_Will_Tell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1786591.And_the_Sea_Will_Tell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105992.Helter_Skelter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348575.Till_Death_Us_Do_Part", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203795.Reclaiming_History", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/792549.Outrage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2135419.The_Prosecution_of_George_W_Bush_for_Murder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
