Yes, it is a novel about Zombies, if you want me to place it in the timeline of the I Zombie I world, it takes places at the same time like the second book of the series My Zombie My. The novel Zombie Radio descrives the begging of the broadcast with the same name, but, before i give away some spoilers i want to say that it is just a book about hope, about sticking to your humanity , no mather what. You can always choose if you want to consider the Zombies, especially Jack Zombies a metaphor for the comercial ever consuming and never full world that we are part of , or if you just want to take the story ad litteram and see them as dark, brainless hungry Monsters. Our nameles DJ is the voice that comes to you via pirate waves, the one that is there when all your dark litle voices are screaming that you should give up, he is the force that will pick you up and fill you with the best drug, hope! paralel to the world going down the drain our dj lives a litle bitt of a love Story of his own, with the gorgeous Alexa, whe dont know exactly who she is, is she what she prettends to be, is she just the incarnation of his need to have somebody to keep him hoping, hell, i am not even sure that she is real and our dj had not suffered a psichotic episode afther the shock of the apocalypse. There are so manny questions, so litle ansewrs. This book will introduce you to the coolest heroin ever, Bethany Nitschimi and the Zero day colective. Curious ?Grab this awesome piece of literature and you will find yourself glued to your device for at least 2 hours of delightful reading, and your hopefully still functional brain bussy with questions for a few more days. Because, is it not this what separates us from the Zombies, the power to ask a question, to wonder, to love, to enjoy a great song and last, but not least, like in Pandoras box there will be always be some pure hope, cuddled somewhere in the deps of your conscious being"}, {"userName": "Pheebz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32536934-pheebz", "userReview": "Zombie Radio was a fun and quick read.
