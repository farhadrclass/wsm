She is all of nine going on twenty. I thought maybe she spoke and acted a little older than a nine year old, but then I thought of the wisdom I have come across from young people and decided to go with the flow. She seeks out Stevie Moore a recluse, who paints and writes story books for children, always sharing the darker side of nature as well as the positive. While there is a notice up outside Stevie's house that says Go Away, Nell is determined to visit and so she does. Stevie is a complicated woman, at a young age she experienced the loss of her mother, so has an immediate 'feel' for Nell. She has had a few unsuccessful marriages and now just lives by herself with her cat Tilly. However she does have an aunt and cousin with whom she is close. She longs for connection but is now careful with her heart.Maddie Kilvert is one of the other women who was part of the 'beach girls', growing up she was secure in the knowledge of the love of her parents and older brother Jack, four years older than her. She always expected the best out of life. Emma is the third 'beach girl' she's an extrovert, welcomes change and excitement and I sensed a little envious of Stevie.Now so many years later life has very much changed for them. One is dead, one does not know and the other is lost in grief, guilt and loss. Can people recover from loss and go on to lead fulfilling lives? It's not easy and all the denial and avoidance will not help in the long run. Is there hope? The story Luanne Rice weaves says a resounding yes.This book sucked me in, I loved the writing and the details of the coastline and the coastal habitat for all kinds of birds and other creatures, that was so well integrated into the story. The theme of family and friendship was strong, as was the redeeming nature of love and faith and overcoming obstacles. One of those books I didn't want to end."}, {"userName": "Olga Godim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7438487-olga-godim", "userReview": "3.5 starsGrief is a funny thing. Sometimes, people grieve not for what was but for what could\u2019ve been, mostly in their imagination. In this book, Emma is dead. She appears in the prologue as a sixteen-year-old girl, and then, two decades later, a year after her death, the entire story unfolds. It involves Emma\u2019s childhood friends \u2013 the beach girls \u2013 plus her widower and her nine-year-old daughter. And like in her childhood, the story still revolves around Emma. I didn\u2019t like what I learned about Emma from the memories of her friends and her family. If she was still alive, they might\u2019ve said: \u201cWhat a heartless bitch.\u201d I definitely wanted to say that. But she is dead. She died tragically, so nobody who knew her want to believe their own knowledge and their own memories of that self-absorbed, shallow woman. They mourn her anyway. They should\u2019ve counted their blessings instead, but the whole novel comes from their mourning. And it is a good story, a story of love, forgiveness, and understanding. A story of renewal and second chances. It would\u2019ve been a much simpler story without Emma in it, but life doesn\u2019t always work in simple ways. Neither does fiction. With all Emma\u2019s faults, she obviously had something good in her: she was a good mother for one of the protagonists, her young daughter Nell. I don\u2019t often like adult books incorporating a child\u2019s POV. It feels a bit like voyeurism, as if I\u2019m peeking into the grieving heart of a child, but in this case, Nell\u2019s grief for her late mother drives the story. Nell\u2019s search for happiness gives the story its complex shape and its flavor of innocence. Nell wants her mother back, yes, but as a young child, she also wants to forget, to move forward, to find someone new and wonderful to love. Unconsciously, as only a young child could, Nell forces her father to face his demons, defeat them, and allow a new love into their lives. The two other lead characters, Nell\u2019s father Jack and Emma\u2019s old friend Stevie, unite in their love for Nell, and that love brings them together. Both are lonely. Both are afraid to do harm: to Nell, to each other, and to their own hearts. Only Nell is the brave one in the story. She doesn\u2019t yet know bitterness or disappointment. She knows only love, and she spreads it around without reservations in her quest for a new family. Life is simple when you\u2019re only nine. Ironically, the most cowardly creature of the three protagonists is the only man in the story, Nell\u2019s father Jack. He is afraid the most. Afraid to trust again. Afraid to make a mistake. Afraid to step into the unknown. Afraid to acknowledge the truth. He resists the new love the hardest. And like a typical man (sorry, my male friends) he makes everyone who loves him suffer because of his cowardice. He makes decisions without consulting anyone, runs away to hide from his unhappiness (which never works, as we all know), even disregards his beloved daughter\u2019s feelings, and only a miracle brings the happy ending to this poignant tale. Overall, it was a good read, if a bit too sentimental and somewhat slower than I prefer. I\u2019m an impatient reader. I always want the plot to move along, to know what happens next as soon as possible, while the author kept getting in my way by describing the beach and the pines. Beautiful descriptions too. Other than that, I liked this novel."}, {"userName": "Rhonda Rae Baker", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/664910-rhonda-rae-baker", "userReview": "I loved this story and the characters! The word pictures were so vivid I felt she was describing places that I have visited in another life.Such deep explainations of family emotions and dynamics it was easy to get caught up in what happened to them. I felt their pain, their dreams, their connection with each other.I'm always surprised by Luanne Rice and the way she paints a picture in words. There were so many details in this story that I was taken away to another place in time or was it to a place that I had visited previously, only time will tell.Thank you Luanne for writing such a beautiful story about Beach Girls...the generations, the connections, the adopted familys, and the chance for a new life. One that is better then any other and one where a person knows they've been predestined to live. The excitement of things turning out as they should, even when they are hard to get through. The little phrases she used were from our generation and so easily related to as if I were experiencing some of my own childhood memories. Oh, to have friends and best friends and family like this...I think we all do at times in our lives and maybe we all may get a chance to rekendle those relationships. If would be wonderful if we all had opportunities to reconnect with someone that knows our family, knows of families like ours, or knew our family from yesteryear. This was the most beautiful story, it was heart breaking or one to be read with tissue in hand but the family dynamics were so touching. I could relate to the tragedies as they are common to the human condition. I'm confident that anyone that picks this novel up will learn something and their faith will not only be challenged but they will find a place to reach out, to dream again, and not be afraid to love. We all are worthy of love and finding that perverbial 'soul mate' that we were meant to be with for this life and all eternity.Can't wait to pick up another novel of yours...you're one of my favorite authors!!!!"}, {"userName": "Dianna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/207908-dianna", "userReview": "This was an easy summer book.

I am notoriously short on imagination, so I went for the obvious. This is a series, evidently, with Beach Girls being the fifth, I think. It was a nice stand-alone story, though, with no trouble at all in not reading the others in the series. I am under the impression that the common thread throughout the series is the location and not the characters, which is an intriguing basis for a series and makes for easing reading out of order.  Story of a widower and his daughter in the aftermath of a horrible car accident, the story is familiar and predictable, but still good storytelling. Throw in the Connecticut coast, a dilapidated castle, a hermit rumored to be a witch and two celebrated artists and you have yourself a nice summer novel!  I was fairly uninvested in this one, but not because it was not a good book. I was uninvested because I had already read my \"palate cleanser\" book of late in the Melody Carlson book Christmas at Harrington's and I was not yet in need of another. I would recommend this one, but only if you need a light and predictable read to cleanse you from a book you can't get off your mind."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7151174-helen", "userReview": "A great book for younger ladies. I did read this ( I am in my 40's) but I really think the theme of this story is more appealing to younger readers.

It's a sad state of affairs when all the Luanne Rice books in this apartment belong to me, not my wife, lol. ++SPOILER ALERT++ I loved Stevie & Nell. Their relationship was so special. I had a very difficult time feeling anything but disdain & rage at Jack & Emma. I saw Emma as shallow, selfish & idealistic (her refusal to read Stevie's books to Nell because they're \"too violent\"- or so she claimed. I think it had more to do with that spark of envy she felt in the prologue when thinking about Stevie being famous). Her self righteous social justice crap which all seemed forgotten the instant her alimony was threatened, HAH. I wanted to like Jack, at heart he was a decent enough person. But he's so emotionally immature & makes that everyone else's problem. He resents what Maddie told him- even after it was proven- & cuts her out of his AND Nell's life for over a year, in spite of her tearful pleading & suffering having lost her mother already. Then whisks her from Atlanta because HE'S sad, takes her away from her best friend, home & past because he's running from his scary feels. Then when she finally starts to heal thanks to Stevie & Peggy, he's ready to whisk her away to Scotland- an ocean away from EVERYTHING she knows, in a totally new country (& not actually telling her they're going till 3 weeks before- & even then letting her believe it's just a trip. Stevie was the one to break the news\u2026 a few days beforehand! Then has her following HIM around on his business trips with a tutor instead of in school with kids her age- y'know, something that might have helped her settle in to the latest place he scurried her off to in his continued frantic fleeing from all things bad. HE didn't even fully want to go, but OH NO, HE SAW HIS SISTER AND HAD FEELS. BETTER LEAVE THE COUNTRY! Ugh, no sympathy for you, bro. And the fact that he simply couldn't understand why Emma hadn't been satisfied as his wife & Nell's mother. Yes, you try being a housewife & see how satisfied you feel, genius. As a whole though, I liked the book. Though not one of her beats, it was still good."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8012470-maggie", "userReview": "Nell and her dad Jack return to Hubbards Point after the tragic death of Nell's mother.

Her unique ability to weave together the bonds of love and family with the challenges and rewards of everyday life has garnered her eight consecutive top-ten New York Times bestselling paperbacks. With Beach Girls, Luanne Rice returns to the place that she was born to write about--the Connecticut shore--to tell a story about a family of women whose lives encompass three generations, their histories intertwined with that of the mystic coastal town that has forever bound them to one another.Beach Girls explores the complex and contradictory territories of love, family and friendship. Luanne Rice's sensuous prose and unforgettably rich and textured characters guide us toward a truth that lies within and sometimes beyond our dreams--an enduring strength that we all must embrace to find our way home and into the hearts of those we cherish most.
