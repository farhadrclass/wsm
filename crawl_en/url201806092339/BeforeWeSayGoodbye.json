She is trying to make sense of the world she lives in and on this day she makes a decision \u2013 to choose life.Dima is an 18 year old Palestinian girl who is top of her class and about to get married. She is also disillusion with life and can see no future for her or her people and she makes a decision \u2013 to choose death.Abraham is an Israeli Jew, married with children and works as a security guard. On this morning he recieves his job from the agency \u2013 a post in a local supermarket.Ghassan is a 23 year old Palestinian expolsives expert. Today he is scouting for a place for his latest recruit (an 18 year old girl) to blow up \u2013 he chooses a supermarket.The book starts at 7am that morning and each short chapter follows each of the characters about their daily business, hour by hour, and discovers their thoughts, feelings and experiences of living in Jerusalem. Not a word is wasted; the narrative is clear, concise and striking. I don\u2019t claim to know much about translating but whatever the original italian was like, translator Alastair mcEwan has done a wonderful job. I felt involved in the story.What I particularly like about this book is that it doesn\u2019t take sides. There is no bias, no judgement; just a beautifully written account of one of the saddest and oldest conflicts in the world. It\u2019s an important subject, beautifully executed in a way that makes it accessible to everyone. Politics and history aren\u2019t prevalent but human emotion is.I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4023864-louise", "userReview": "nicely told short story, taking no sides.each chapter tells of an hour in a day from various characters, including 18-year-old Israeli Jewish girl.

However, this is not the case in this novel, which is well rounded and very poignant.It is apparent from reading this novel that the characters are very well researched and this is explored really well in this book. I really did find this very poignant and felt only empathy for Dima as she goes about her 'mission'.One of the best things about this novel is the style of writing, which reads like a play split into scenes, focussing on different characters. This certainly helped with the character development and made the story easy to digest.The only criticism I would make of this book is that it does rely on the reader having some previous knowledge of the situation in Isreal and the conflicts which have, and still are, occuring there. I don't think this was fully apparent from reading the novel.I really would recommend this read to anyone. Abit like 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' both young and old readers have much to gain from reading this novel"}, {"userName": "Abigail  ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13534676-abigail", "userReview": "I finneshed last page finaly"}, {"userName": "Em Chainey (Bookowski)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5548299-em-chainey-bookowski", "userReview": "Bir intihar bombacisinin son saatleri...

Although it primarily follows two different 18-year-old girls, one Palestinian the other Israeli, there is a very large cast of characters. If anything, there are so many characters making the interweaving plots difficult to follow. The direction of the plot becomes obvious quite early on. The two girls, Dima and Myriam each find themselves facing a day of change. Myrian is trying to come to terms with the loss of her closest friend to a Palestinian bomb. For her, this particular morning brings her some hope for the future. On the other hand, Dima\u2019s mind is set on revenge for the treatment her friends and family have received at the hands of the Israelis. The two girls lives are separated by more than culture. Their life experiences give them very different prospects and outlooks. And although Dima and Myriam are the central characters in the short but poignant story, the others involved each plays their part in the story\u2019s tragic journey.It is not an easy read. Keeping track of the multitude of characters and events presents a challenge in itself, but add to that the intensity of the story itself and I would struggle to call it entertaining. But it is well worth the read.Gabriela takes about as neutral a stance as possible, looking at both sides of the conflict. And in that, I thank she has achieved what she set out to do. Conflicts such as that between Israelis and Palestinians are never quite as straightforward as they seem."}, {"userName": "TheBookAddictedGirl", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5009509-thebookaddictedgirl", "userReview": "Starting at 7am, 29th March 2002, Before We Say Goodbye tells the story hour by hour, until, seven hours later, everything is changed...I\u2019m honestly not sure where to start this review. Before I Say Goodbye was absolutely amazing \u2013 but it was more than that. It really made me think, made me feel, and made me understand everything that has been going on between the Israeli and the Palestinians. I felt close to tears as I got nearer the end: it all seemed so real.And, you see, that\u2019s the thing: Before I Say Goodbye is based on the true story of the suicide bombing of a supermarket in 2002. A story of two girls \u2013 one a Palestinian, one an Israeli Jewess \u2013 who look so similar that they\u2019re ironically mistaken for sisters. The two girls couldn\u2019t be more different, but they both have one thing in common: \u201clost eyes\u201d...What makes this book even more incredible is the fact that it doesn\u2019t judge. Gabriella Ambrosio somehow manages the impossible, remaining completely unbiased all the way through. She states in the Author\u2019s Note: \u201cEveryone warned me: if you write this story you\u2019ll have to take sides, express a point of view. But a point of view is not a good point of view if it only shows one side of the story.\u201d And I agree. Her book is a work of genius; it\u2019s told from everyone\u2019s point of view, and yet from no-one\u2019s, taking us through everyone\u2019s world, and yet judging none of them. How she managed to do this is completely beyond me: all I know is that I loved it.The only fault was the fact that to begin with, it was quite hard to keep track of all the characters. In every hour, there are little sections told from various characters points of view: Myriam\u2019s, Dima\u2019s, a guard\u2019s, the girls\u2019 fathers\u2019, and so on. The saving grace for me was a little list of characters at the beginning of the book, but before long I didn\u2019t have to go check who was who. Also it jumped from one to the other, just as I felt I was beginning to really get to know one character. But \u2013 even if it could be a little tricky \u2013 that jumping was what kept me hooked. It was what made me stay up until one, completely captivated by the two girls, their lives and their thoughts. The pace was lightening-fast \u2013 long chapters, sentences or a longer book just would\u2019ve ruined the effect, in my opinion.I\u2019ll be the first to tell you that this isn\u2019t an easy book, and I almost smiled when I got to the end and saw that Ambrosio had written: \u201cIt was a challenge to write; it will be a challenge to read.\u201d What made it harder was that the story actually happened, something I honestly didn\u2019t find out until I finished the book and stumbled onto the Author\u2019s Note. But, despite all of that, this was one of the best books I\u2019ve read. It helped me to understand what people living in Jerusalem are going through, and how far some of them are willing to go so they can be heard. As I finished, I was fighting back tears \u2013 and losing \u2013 stunned by everything I\u2019d learnt and felt. It isn\u2019t an easy book, or a particularly happy one, but it really makes you think about and appreciate what you have. These two girls lived in a place where fear was pretty much always there, as a minor character points out right before the end. \u201cWe have become a violent people, that\u2019s true. But when they\u2019ve been pointing a gun at your chest since you were small and you\u2019ve been subjected to abuse since you were born, what do they expect you to become, if not violent?\u201d (And, yes, I cried at that, and about a billion other little quotes or actions throughout the book.)The two girls, Dima and Myriam, just felt so real to me, and I understood what they were feeling. I\u2019m not going to begin to act like I get what it\u2019s like, growing up in a country where you\u2019re always scared, but I knew what these girls were thinking. So, no, not a happy book.But an amazing one, and one that will stay with me for a long time. I can\u2019t tell you how it will make you think, but it will make you think, I promise that. My head\u2019s still spinning. Honestly, I can\u2019t recommend it enough."}, {"userName": "S'hi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/784353-s-hi", "userReview": "As a young adult\u2019s book I read this with the question of how I would have responded to it when I was a teenager. For some reason the only place I ever wanted to travel when I was a child was Israel. I joined a penfriend club and distributed contacts for my school friends as I began my friendship with a girl my own age on the other side of the world. She told me about compulsory military service in that tone of \u2018its\u2019 just part of our lives\u2019, but also of her concerns for everyone in the region and her interest in Peace Now. Eventually, in my early twenties, I went to stay with her for a few weeks. On my first day there, walking along the beach, I was shocked by an army helicopter heading along the coast toward Lebanon. This was the daily feeling my friend had not managed to put in her letters. As I read this book I knew I would not have taken in the reality of it. I would have been as numb and distanced as the characters became by their constant exposure. By my numbness would come from ignorance.But the world has changed since I was a teenager. Youth of today have had far more exposure to the horrors of war from all around the world. Television coverage of atrocities do not spare the young even here in peaceful Australia. What impact might a story such as this have for them now?The most important aspect of this novel is its lack of drama over the events it portrays. Each character is given their own small space within which to give some glimpse of their own world as it had been, as they had once hoped for it to be, and as it seemed to close in around all of them without them seeming to be able to change it into anything more positive. The sense of despair and desperation portrayed here is clipped and stilted. But I wonder how youth who do not feel any sense of choice and direction in their own lives might handle this view of a whole society caught in such despair.Personally I did not feel any great revelation in the idea that two girls from opposite sides of the same conflict could be mistaken by others as sisters. The tone of the story does not make this contrast sit out for me, the way the explanation of this being the impetus for writing the story does in the back of the book. Surely if this is meant to be the pivot point for those involved in such a conflict to be able to see their own situation differently, such an image must become so strong for them that they can receive this truth differently. Although it is a well written book, with many viewpoints edged in against each other, and no judgment but rather a chance to consider those different viewpoints, I question its placement as a teenage novel. For those who are in strong enough families and who have capacity to reach beyond their own circumstances, the connections to Amnesty International in the back of the book may be well worthwhile. However, I would be cautious about recommending this book too far afield without appropriate support through more than the kind of English classes I experienced at school. I would think for many students it may prove too full of despair for them to be able to manage on their own."}, {"userName": "Bree T", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3913428-bree-t", "userReview": "Before We Say Goodbye is written as a third person narrative switching between quite a few people in the lead up to a terrorist suicide bombing. Dima, a Palestinian girl of eighteen who is thinking of her future \u2013 marriage to her cousin Faris, further studies, quite a lot of freedom. Myriam, a Jewish girl of the same age has yet to recover from the loss of her best friend Michael, who himself was the victim of a bombing recently. They had plans to return to America, where they had both lived at various times in their lives, looking to return to the land of the free. That plan has been cut short now and Myriam is lost. She doesn\u2019t know what she wants to do. Abraham is a store security guard, possessed of an uncanny ability to know when someone is walking into his store with plans. Plans that could be deadly. He receives a call in the morning and is given the choice of two locations and he chooses the supermarket so that he may get home early to spend time with his younger wife and their two sons. It is a choice that will end his life. Ghassan is 23, a Palestinian and explosives expert who is co-ordinating the next attack. He is meeting with the young girl who has made the choice of self-sacrifice.Before We Say Goodbye is a tiny novel, clocking in at just 145 pages. Each \u2018chapter\u2019 is an hour out of the eventful day, clocking in with each character so that we can see what they are doing. Starting at 7am and ending at 2pm when the bomb goes off, the author manages to pack the small novel full of thoughts, emotions and actions. There is no judgement here, there is no preaching. There is no Israeli propaganda, there is no Palestinian propaganda. That isn\u2019t the point. You are given just a snippet of this conflict, just an insight into the lives of two similar girls \u2013 same age, who live near each other and study, who have seen terrible things as a part of their everyday lives. Who have faced losses and felt anger. One of them makes a choice, to fight back against the injustices she has seen, to bring about the kind of suffering she has experienced. She is determined to take out many \u2013 her life is worth a hundred lives!This novel has been made required reading for high schoolers in the author\u2019s native Italy and in universities in countries like Australia. It has been published in both Hebrew and Arabic and is used in both Israel and Palestine as an education tool which I think is just an incredible thing. If you\u2019re interested in reading a wholly non-judgmental book free of opinions and bias then this really is a book you should pick up. It\u2019s so many things \u2013 engrossing, insightful, balanced and the translation, by Alastair McEwan, is perfect ."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2278428-robert", "userReview": "Beautifully written, very short novel. (I think it takes about 2 hours to read it all). I read this in bursts - nearly half of it in one go while waiting at an airport, then, months later, another chunk.Why the months of reading other things? Because, as beautifully written and effective as this novel is, it is not an easy read. The book has a dreamy atmosphere - even though it is extremely well grounded, too. A strange thing to say: a book that feels like a (bad) dream, and almost journalism, all at the same time.Initially, I struggled a bit (one character's internal process is a bit surreal, and I can sometimes struggle with the surreal). But once I got past the discombobulation that the sheer number of characters (and different names, all of which sound equally alien to my ears) and the occasional episodes of near-madness engender, it is a very rewarding book.On some levels, I want to set aside a few hours and read it again, all in one go, to appreciate the craftsmanship of the writing, the detail, and the emotional depth. On another level, I may never read it again at all. The dreaminess is not just pretty, it is sinister, too, and there is that feeling of inevitability that sometimes haunts a dream.If you watched Paradise Now, or if you read Joe Sacco's Palestine, and were able to appreciate (though not, perhaps, enjoy) these, then Before We Say Goodbye is likely to be well up your street. It is so beautifully crafted, there is almost joy in it - though it is filled with sadness and despair..."}, {"userName": "Grace", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5258285-grace", "userReview": "A very short and quite nice novel really, for me it did take a while to quite understand what was going on but this novel was very powerful and wonderful in the way the story knitted together. In this book, each and every person involved has their own story in which within a short time all come together to be part of something quite monumental in the town of Jerusalem, Knowing the background about the Palestinians and Israel could be quite useful in this case as it made the book more easier to understand especially with some of the main events that were taking place. Due to my keen interest in such matters about Palestinians and Israel it made a more sound understanding of that time of era which did actually contribute to some of my exam work! Would have never guessed that! This book is truly something everyone should read, it makes you realize how lucky you are to be in a place that doesn't have such riots in their everyday life and it makes you feel very sorry for the history of Jerusalem. Also, it has many key quotes in which I love and always will remember, they made a very powerful impact on the way I see life as it is. 'the future is what you have today, the past us what you shall live tomorrow'.Truly an outstanding book, highly recommended to anyone interested in such history."}, {"userName": "Josie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21250-josie", "userReview": "Before We Say Goodbye is a short book, but the writing is achingly bittersweet. It fictionalises the events of 29 March 2002, starting at 7am, and ending shortly after 2pm when Dima, an 18-year-old Palestinian suicide bomber, detonates her bomb, killing not only herself but a security guard and an 18-year-old Israeli Jewish girl. Myriam, the Jewish girl, looked so similar to Dima (they both had \"lost eyes\") that they were mistaken for sisters.I read this book in one sitting, but it will stay with me for a long time.There's a whole cast of characters but, unsurprisingly, it is Dima and Myriam who stand out. Dima, who, tired of the daily injustices and humiliations of her life in the camp where people fear retribution from the soldiers who guard them, decides to take matters into her own hands and restore her family's honour. Myriam, who, still traumatised by the death of her best friend Michael in a bombing two months earlier and unable to properly grieve, photographs trees. As Myriam begins to see a future for herself, and hope, Dima has already accepted she has neither.This book doesn't judge. It doesn't take sides.

It taught me a bit about something I really don\u2019t know anything about and the concept was really interesting. I found myself feeling as the characters did about their situation and allows you to understand their actions, particularly Dima. I also liked that just at it said on the back the book managed to stay away from picking a side.

There were so many and I couldn't remember the differences between them and I couldn't remember all of their names. I had to keep flicking back to the front to find out who they were and what relevance they had to the plot. Because I was flicking to see who's who every new chapter, I kept losing the thread of the storyline, which inevitably meant I missed the finer points of this novel. The ending, for the same reasons, didn't have as big as an impact as hoped.All I can say is I'm glad this book wasn't any longer.
