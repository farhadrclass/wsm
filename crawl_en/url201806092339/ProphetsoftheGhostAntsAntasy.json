When a new colony is to be formed, Anand is delighted at the prospect but soon finds himself living with a different clan and a new outlook. When the Ghost Ants attack his new home, Anand has a chance to change the world...This was on my radar for a long time and I couldn't resist when it popped up on Netgalley. I was not disappointed.While I'm not a fan of today's extruded fantasy product, originally scores big points with me and Prophets of the Ghost Ants has originality to spare. After a great cataclysm, the Earth is nearly destroyed and humans gradually evolve into being insect-sized for survival. Humans live in symbiosis with their gargantuan insect brethren and largely live in a caste system.You don't normally read a fantasy novel where insects play a prominent role and the main character is in charge of emptying the chamber pots of nobles. I really liked the use of the caste system, somewhat emulating the hierarchy of ants. I also liked that each clan lived in symbiosis with different insects, like roaches, different varieties of ants, and termites.Since it was a fantasy novel, you pretty much knew Anand was going to turn things upside down but I was surprised at the magnitude. It reminded me of Michael Moorcock's Elric books, only without so much genocide and melancholy. It was also very well thought out. There were no logical holes in the setting of the \"Why don't they fly to Mordor on a giant eagle and drop the ring in the volcano\" variety.It was a fun journey, watching Anand go from being a shit-scraper to the founder of a nation. The violence was harsh and there was a fair bit of smut in it, all the things I look for in a fantasy saga.

Writing is creative by its nature, but it isn't always that... adventurous. When most people use the word creative they mean something more akin to unique/original/unusual, and this book definitely lands in that category. Many times while reading it I'd find myself thinking \"Whaaa? how does he come up with this shit??\" (That's good shit, not bad shit, folks.)I honestly wasn't quite sure what to expect when I began it, and at 31% in I had one of those \"oh god, I have THAT much left to read??\" moments, but then I forged ahead and became more engrossed in the world as I got further into the book.The whole idea of humans being tiny, like... the size of one of these letters, was really intriguing. Plus of course, having their world being so intertwined with the world of the insects was fascinating. I think the author did a great job of creating a highly detailed, unique, memorable world. Here's where we get to the part I'm torn about. The world in this book is very brutal. That's one of the things I didn't like about it, although that's like saying I don't like that water is clear. It is what it is, because the brutality is part of that world and required for the story. Some folks love to read about wars and fighting; I'm just not one of them. (I do like the occasional battles between smaller groups though.) The brutality and harshness of the characters made them a little harder to connect to. But again, for them to be different, it would have changed the whole flavor of the world. They've been fighting for their survival for centuries and have apparently by necessity regressed to some behavior and perspectives that humans would like to outgrow. Now they're struggle is to regain some of the compassion, justice, and equality that was lost over the ages. That's where Anand comes in...Anand was pretty cool. I didn't always buy his character (I didn't always understand why he was so different from everyone else) but I enjoyed following him around. He was the primary character, although some time was spent describing what was happening with other pivotal characters occasionally. Anand was key though - and fortunately he is a pretty respectable guy (although like I said before, still had some of that brutality going on).Oh, and this book was absolutely DISGUSTING! Which I kind of loved. :-P Seriously, the things these people ate, oh my god... truly pukeworthy. It would make a really interesting movie, but I would have to close my eyes a lot. :-P This is a very \"visual\" book. There are so many curious creatures and objects and interactions that you can't get through a page without an interesting picture show up in your mind. I'd just love to see some illustrations from this book.One more thing, if you read this, don't be a dumbass like me and completely overlook the fact that there is a map included; it could come in handy. It could also use a glossary, which it doesn't have. Usually when I pick up a book and it has those things I think \"oh oh\" and am tempted to put it away. But, this was a pretty complex world, between the different cities, types of ants and insects, religions, etc. It becomes difficult to track after a while. Still, even with the confusion, I enjoyed this book once I got settled into this intriguing new world.Footnote addition 6 months after reading:Memorability Factor 9/10 (My memory sucks but I remember this one better than most!)Follow this author?

From the very beginning, I liked and empathized with Anand, and even though you know from the description that he will rise from the bottom caste of society to heroically lead his people, you can't help but feel for him and root for him every step of the way. He and the other characters are all believable, and I especially enjoyed the political intrigue between the royals. As the story develops, there is a very interesting religious component. It's a commentary on organized religion that draws parallels to our own world, and makes the reader think and question without telling you what to think. I loved the symbolism of the Dranverites smashing their idols and the description of their \"Loose Doctrine.\"If there was one thing that I didn't like, it's that through most of the book, the main character seems almost too perfect. He is brave and outspoken, almost always knows what to do, attractive - and women always want to sleep with him and end up being very satisfied. I was bothered a little bit by the fact that he seemed to enjoy some of the last part a little too much, especially given the fact that women in this world had very little power and some were forced to sleep with him (and he with them for the sake of \"the mission.\") I saw this as a deeper flaw that wasn't really addressed in the book. Maybe other readers won't judge him as harshly though. Also, the very last page of the book cut back a little bit on him being a perfect hero, in a very interesting way. I wouldn't necessarily call it a plot twist, but it definitely added some more complexity to his character and the story, and made me think. There's violence and a little gore in the story, but it's necessary, because this is a story about a harsh world. Also, the final battle is nothing short of epic. Overall, I loved this story and really got lost in it. Something else to note, when I picked up this copy, it wasn't possible to buy it new, I could only buy used. There is a new illustrated version though, which covers the first fourth of this book.

Hope you love it too. Here is the review from Kirkus: \"In this postapocalyptic science-fiction allegory, diminutive tribal humans share the world, and a deeply intertwined society, with hordes of insects.Anand, the despised young lower-caste protagonist of Carlton\u2019s innovative novel, knows perfectly well how his life will unfold. He slaves in the filthy middens of his human colony, marked by skin color, scent and even body posture as inferior to the higher classes of humans who run the colony and serve the queen. In this postapocalyptic version of human society, where humans have evolved to the size of insects in response to the planet\u2019s diminshing resources, someone like Anand has no hope of rising above his station or changing his life. His only hope is to grow old working in peace rather than be killed by the myriad insectoid menaces that stalk his world. (The author expertly shifts his narrative pacing for violent scenes that crop up frequently in the novel and are intensely memorable.) But when word comes that his colony is splitting up, sending a queen and a host of workers to found a new colony, fate offers Anand a chance to become more than he\u2019s ever dreamed. \u201cThe history of our land is always written in blood,\u201d one character tells him, but in addition to blood there\u2019s doctrine here\u2014Carlton has a surprising amount to say about organized religion and its heresies (the so-called Loose Doctrine of Dranveria plays a major role in the book), and approaches his commentary with drama and intelligence. Anand becomes something of a firebrand, insisting \u201cNo idol, book, word, place or relic should ever be held sacred\u2026Only human life is sacred.\u201d The complications he faces in his rise to power make for a gripping read.The wobbly science of its premise notwithstanding, this is a fascinating, enjoyable sci-fi yarn.\" Perry Crowe, Kirkus Reviews"}, {"userName": "Faye, la Patata", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7650833-faye-la-patata", "userReview": "Okay, here goes.I first saw this title in the Goodreads group Apocalypse Whenever when it was in their bookshelf. I thought the title was very unique and intriguing so that pushed me to look it up on Amazon and buy myself a copy. I do admit that I wasn't expecting a lot... I mean, ants? I didn't think anybody could possibly make a good story out of those insects... but after reading the introduction, I knew I was in for a roller coaster ride.I don't want to spoil the story and summarize the novel, so I'll make this quick and brief. The setting was very original. I haven't yet read any book where humans and ants are of the same size and where the latter is used as tools for everyday life (foraging, riding, warfare), so it was very refreshing. Oftentimes, a lot of authors don't pull it off successfully, so I give the author of this book an applause for being able to write a good novel of such a setting. Story-wise, it's something you've seen before - a rags to riches kind of plot. We're introduced to a boy who is seen as an outcast because of his mother who was from a tribe of roaches, and with his good heart, courage, and determination, was able to squirm out of his misery and became someone far greater and revered by all. While that itself is not original, it's not something that's dragging thanks to the unique setting of this book. If there was one thing I didn't like about him, it was that he was too likable!! haha, if that makes sense. I didn't find any real flaw, and while that's not bad, oftentimes, it makes the character one dimensional and boring. Fortunately, that wasn't the case in this book, and for that I'm glad. I was also happy that while there was romance, the story didn't revolve around it. Writing-wise, the author did an excellent job. Chapters were nice, some long but are not dragging, some short but they don't feel like they \"lack\" something. All were substantial chapters and nothing felt like a filler. I loved the fact that there was no abuse of details. In these kind of books, authors tend to drag on and on describing everything. Thankfully, the author knew better and it makes the book a more fulfilling and meaningful read. There are just enough that the readers are able to catch up and understand the new terms and technicalities. The writing also was very well done to the point that it successfully makes you feel empathy to the main character and the obstacles that he goes through. He embarrasses a royal and you go \"Yay! You go, hero!\" and when he gets into hot water, you go, \"Nooo!\" All in all, a good read and I can't wait to read the second book!!!"}, {"userName": "Lisa Reads & Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5395843-lisa-reads-reviews", "userReview": "I was strangely compelled to read this novel. The cover, the title, the premise of humans evolving down to the size of insects and learning to use each to their advantage - appeared all very creative and amazing. And it was. I was thoroughly immersed in a world of ants, termites, wasps, locusts, and tiny humans. Very cool. The description of life, clothing, food, and social structure was rich, fascinating and well told. The major conflict was important, and close to my heart - moral reaction against the enslavement of people through a caste system with all the complexities of attempting to free minds and hearts that have been downtrodden and starved. The story addresses the lies and ploys of those in power to stay in power. It doesn't flinch at aggression, cruelty nor fear, neither human nor insect. Truly, the novel has fantastic potential for future adventures. Now for the elements I felt took some luster off the gem, and these are only my personal tastes. I'm fine with an Alexander The Great -type hero, who at a tender age is able to conquer more experienced leaders and nations - mainly because people get set in their ways and don't listen to new ideas, or youth. My distaste was for the hero's juvenile approach to women, sex, and romantic relationships. Now I might sound like a feminist, but really, I'm speaking from a female point of view when I say I don't admire a mythic hero, on his way to becoming viewed as a prophet when he freely murders from anger, rapes victims (even if he does apologize), and belly laughs after impregnating a queen who is horrified to discover who he is - even if she deserves it. The hero is a mixed bag of honor and vindictiveness, with more than a touch of young male recklessness and rationalization. At times I was annoyed with him. At others, I cheered him on. Nothing wrong with all that, but rape scenes starring the hero was a bit of a downer, as were the shallow and \"convenient\" thoughts and actions of many of the female characters(not all, just some). The writing was good, but small things, such as POV changes, sometimes mid-paragraph, would have gotten my wrists whacked. When I learned that this novel was published as a proof of concept for a film and/or graphic novel, everything made more sense. The intended audience was broader than I imagined. Also, I realized that I had visualized everything in a graphic novel sort of way. Interesting. Anyway, I do recommend this story and commend the author for the mighty amount of work put into the writing of it. I expect Anand will mature into a full fledged prophet during the remainder of the trilogy.

The social structure is defined in all the communities so wonderfully including the caste systems, religion, dress, food, courtship, jobs, war, etc. The bigger picture also of how the different communities interact, the world view, and all the smaller tidbits that would be overlooked it but brought to light in this amazing book. It is a time after the big boulder has struck and great famine. Man, to avoid hunger, has evolved smaller and then smaller. This is an age when man is as small as an insect and interacts in the insect world. It is totally fascinating and I can not stress enough the detailed imagination that went into this. Unfortunately, the cruelty of man did not evolve out of him. Shown in the prejudice of the caste system, the wars, the slavery, and more. But love, valor, and bravery is there also.

Ever hear about a book that sounded so exactly like it was written just for you that you were almost afraid to read it because there was no possible way it was as brain-explodingly awesome as you desperately wanted it to be and so you let a whole year go by between OMG MUST BUY NOW purchase and actually starting to read it?I mean, come on, tiny, tiny humans who ride ants and locusts around like horses! Who share mounds and pheromone signatures with various species of ants! As if Edmund O. Wilson started writing science fiction! Or at least epic fantasy! I mean, who's been peeking at my Christmas list?So yeah, my expectations for this were unreasonably high going in, and I had to sort of grit my teeth and risk them being unmet to even start reading this book. The question thus becomes: were they met?More like confounded. Prophets of the Ghost Ants is one of the most unusual novels I've ever read, and may genuinely qualify as unique. Though I suppose there might be some who want to describe it as Dune with insects, that still doesn't quite capture it. For one thing, the fanatical monotheistic desert tribe are the bad guys. Though there is something very Muad'Dib-ish about our hero.Anand*, starts out life as the lowest of the low, a bottom-of-the-heap half-caste** among a vast tribe of humans-and-leafcutter ants (the humans are essentially parasitizing the ants, but no one but Anand ever wants to face up to that fact) but soon learns a bit more about his true heritage and special destiny, like so many fantasy heroes do. In this case, it's because his mother came from a tribe of roach-herders, and while this bit of interbreeding makes Anand even more revolting to the leafcutter people, the roach-herders think he's destined to improve their lot, by improving the way they get treated. He gets betrothed to a very pretty girl and just has to wait until he's sixteen to take up his exalted role in his mother's tribe.But until then, he's stuck being an ant guy. And when the human queen of the leafcutter tribe gives birth to a daughter, by tradition and necessity, the mound must fission (after the fashion of anthills), with a certain percentage of the mound's ant and human populations striking off to found a new colony elsewhere. Guess who has to go with them.Even worse: there are other populations of insects-and-people out there, also expanding their territories. And some of them don't like what leafcutters do to the landscape, no, not at all. And while some of them are secular, somewhat happy-go-lucky quasi-anarchist/demarchist types who ridicule the idea that people should be as socially stratified as ants, some others are religious fantatics, who live with and ride the titular ghost ants (though for the purposes of this book, ghost ants are all the way transparent, and don't just have see-through abdomens. Oh, and they're also huge [for ants] and aggressive as hell, so, um, yeah) and won't rest until all the humans in their world worship the termite god who originally gave them succor in the desert to which their founders were banished long ago -- a desert caused by the defoliating, despoiling ways of the leafcutter tribes. D'oh!So in the midst of its speculations about what life might be like for a humanity that is the only vertebrate land animal to survive a series of stellar disasters, and could only do so by evolving into something as small as the arthopods that are the planet's only other survivors, Prophets of the Ghost Ants is at bottom a clash of civilizations. The leafcutter tribe is top-down, its rigid social structure not dictated so very much by its coexistence with/parasitism on its ants as by a set of inherited religious beliefs enforced by a fat and lazy priestly caste; the anarchic freedom-lovers are willing to live and let live as long as no one tries to coerce anybody; the ghost ant riders are a dire threat to both. And moving among them all as a sort of triple (if not quadruple) agent is Anand, emissary to the leafcutters from the democracy, spy on the ghost ant fanatics, but really only looking to reconnect with his beloved roach tribe and his destined bride. Would I have enjoyed this without the insect angle? Probably not nearly as much, since stripped of its entomological content it would just be another bog standard fantasy plot, albeit with a welcome attention to the idea that feudalism isn't the only way to go, with a little bit of Moses of the Mandricanthites thrown in for good measure.What saved it for me was the little things, like for instance, the way that water behaves in this world, which Carlton got very, very right. At the scale of an ant, surface tension becomes much more of a force than we experience at this scale; an ant can pick up a drop of water, hold it above its head, and collapse it into its mouth.**** And this is very much in evidence in Prophets of the Ghost Ants, as when Anand, in a highly symbolic gesture, \"made a show of dunking his hands in the bulging dome of water in the basin.\" This coupled with details about scents and pheromones, and the relish with which Anand plays on the fact that even in this world, most people have an unreasoning fear/disgust reaction to roaches, kept it fun for me.Oh, and the battle scenes. I think Carlton had the most fun cooking those up and imagining all the different military applications for, e.g., rhinocerous beetles and night wasps and locusts, oh my. Wonder if he's read Jeff Lockwood.Of course it turns out this is merely book one of a planned \"Antasy\" trilogy. Aren't they all. Except, well, he had me at Antasy.*This is the second time in as many books I've run into an important character seemingly named after an important disciple of the Buddha; a professor in Nexus was explicitly so named, as befits a Thai monk and teacher. Here, though, we only get sly references to the possible, er, additive qualities of such a name. Amusing coincidence, anyway.**It's one of the conceits* of Prophet of the Ghost Ants that the teeny tiny humans adopt the rigid social structures of the species with which they co-habitate, from a queen who gives birth to multiple (as in five or six) sons almost every time (daughters are rare, and have consequences) and who actually rules the mound through, in the case of Anand's leafcutter ant people, 127 castes of worker. *And this novel has many conceits, starting with the idea that humans that tiny would still be as intelligent and neurologically plastic as you and I are, though I'm not sure a brain reduced to that scale could possibly be complex enough? Anyway, this strikes me as almost as funny as the stereotypical giant human-sized insect scenario which I know for a fact is physically impossible because the muscle-to-exoskeleton ratio of creatures that big would not allow them to move at all. So what; we've rolled with Them! all this time, so I can roll with ant-sized people with human-sized intellects. And yes, this is my first footnote of a footnote. I'm turning into David Foster Wallce.***He has written some literary fiction, Anthill, but I've yet to read it.****I first learned of this from Richard P. Feynman. Yes, that Feynman.

Always a favorite, the underdog fights the system to free the slaves and create democracy across the Queendoms. The most compelling aspect of the novel is it's original story. Humans evolving 1/1000th of their original sizes. Red-blooded animals are extinct. Insects rule the planet alongside humans. It was very interesting to read the descriptions of this macroscopic world from a microscopic perspective. I became engrossed in the development of this new world so eloquently imagined by Clark. I found the plot very well constructed and easy to follow. That may seem like a minor compliment; however at one point, the story follows up to three different story-lines that all collide for the climax. It gets tricky. There are a lot of parallels among characters, but the hurdles they face and the choices they ultimately make force them down different paths. I would say it is easy to mix up, however, as I mentioned, Clark has written a novel that is reader-friendly.The new world created has changed my view on insects. The roles they play in coordination with humans are very important. The roles also seem like common sense after you read the novel, however I think that Clark spent some time in the dirt to study and observe their natural habits. All of the details were covered (castes systems, food, clothing, social structure, and relationships which include human:human, insect:insect, and insect:human). I'm very supportive of new authors. I believe that makes me slightly more lenient on little grammatical mistakes and writing styles. My only complaints are that occasionally (very rarely) there were a few misplaces periods, \"then\" was used rather than \"than\", and sometimes Anand was chauvinistic. I am supportive of women, but I am not a super feminist. That's why it didn't bother me when Anand had such an impersonal view of sex, when he raped victims and apologized for it later, and when he willingly engaged in sexual acts with other women other than his betrothed despite the fact that he had been smitten with Daveena since he met her. In addition, as a woman, I don't think that I would encourage my husband/fiance to sleep with someone else just to confirm him status in society. I guess I do sound like a feminist. I just think that it could be considered risky to make such a strong male character for a new author because it MIGHT limit the target audience to males-- or at least decrease the amount of female readers.Prophets of the Ghost Ants is a new generation of fantasy-science fiction novels. The story line (thankfully) leaves much room for sequels, but the story doesn't feel incomplete. Anand leaves you feeling satisfied in the end. I found a lot of parallels between the fight for democracy and the religious wars. I won't go into further details for fear of ruining the book.

Is one of the best books I've read all year. Possibly even one of my all time favorites! The premise is a *smidge* unbelievable - That humans in the future have evolved (devolved) down to the size of insects, and actually cohabitate with them in clans separated by type. But not so unbelievable that it dragged me out of the story. FAR from it! I literally couldn't put the book down and inhaled it in less than 2 days. (I'm absolutely terrified of ALL insects & *still* I loved it. That's saying something.)Lovely, flowing prose. (Brought to mind \"The Bees\" and a bit of \"The Golden Compass\".)

This is a really somewhat unique and interesting story, I really enjoyed reading it. The integration of humans with insects and other consequences of their shared lives is really well done and draws you into the story. After a little bit of a slow start, the story really picks up and invests the reader further into wanting to know the outcome, with plenty of action and surprises, but also nicely developed characters and personal stories. I'm happy to give it a good review, and I recommend it highly. I have to wonder if there may be another in the series in the future ;)"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10808504-mike", "userReview": "Glad I stumbled on this novel which is the work of a strange and powerful imagination. The opening page features the hero getting slobbered over by a blow fly on his daily trip to the dump. It just gets stranger and more inventive after that. This is a world where tiny humans, as small as ants, are living as the parasites of insects. It will take you far, far away to a world you have never seen yet is kinda like our own. I'm blown away. Carleton has a lot to say about race, religion, sexism and tribalism but he's also written a damn good adventure. Warning: it's not a novel for the faint-of-heart. Some of the details are grisly, much of the content is dark, and when insects are a major food source, some of the meals here are gross-outs. The hero, Anand, travels many lands, and one of them is an enlightened society where there is religious tolerance and an intolerance of racism. It's a place where women not just share power but seem to dominate the military and political institutions, a feminist utopia where the greatest aims are peace and prosperity for all and where only defensive wars are waged. Later Anand ends up in an opposite place where a warrior tribe are intent on converting the world to its fundamentalist worship of their termite/moon god (!!!) a place where women have no status except as mothers to future warriors, and where slavery and brutality are the norm. Some of that is hard to stomach but its true to Carleton's themes. His hero is a gifted teenager, but he's no paragon. He makes mistakes in his mission to change his world, compromises his own morality, and lies when it suits or amuses him (kind of like Holden Caulfield). All the way to the last page, Anand can't completely overcome his own \"tribal indoctrination\" and leaves one boiling pot of water to end up in a cauldron of it. I liked him, but I wanted to smack him too.Carleton is one of those all omniscient writers like Tolkien, Frank Herbert and Pratchett who likes to head hop which may turn some people off and his prose is both meaty and intricate and a little (probably intentionally) archaic -- it reminds me of certain Indian writers. And just as I was getting into the story of Anand and his adventures, the story switches to that of Queen Polexeema who is almost as important a character. I was wondering just how and when their stories were going to intersect and it doesn't happen until about 250 pages later! The world building here is complete and so vivid but the beginning does have some expositional passages to get through until the arrival of the ghost ants and the Hulkrites. After that it flies and I could only put it down for trips to the toilet. In that way it reminded me of Lord of the Rings which takes some time before the quest begins. The story really is fantastic. Looking forward to the sequel and in withdrawal until its arrival."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6211500-rebecca", "userReview": "I wasn't entirely sure what to expect of this book when I picked it up, it goes against the usual sci-fi giant insects and instead turns it on it's head and has evolution shrinking down the human race, who then rely on the insects populations to survive. This is made immediately obvious with Anand, the main protagonist, having his face slavered over by a fly in the first chapter (giving me horrible flashbacks to invertebrate biology lab sessions). Anand is a character who I'm not entirely sure that I like, at times I sympathise greatly with his cause and at other times I feel extremely frustrated with his choices. The justification of his war to provide the slope with a more Dranverian world view whilst he eschewed all their beliefs was possibly the most infuriating thing for me, so I was more than pleased with the letter he received at the end of the book, thus providing him with the bitter-sweet feeling that he should have at the very least had. I would like to think it may ensure the arrogance that occasionally shows through his character is kept in check in a potential second book.I think that is maybe the biggest point in this book, that Anand and his cousin Pleckoo are so alike, both justifying their depravities for the greater good, but just what are those greater goods? This book certainly pushes the darker issues with religion influencing war and culture which certainly makes the reader think whenever they get to the end of a chapter. This was most certainly the case for me after the rape chapters, which left me very uncomfortable with some actions.All in all, I really enjoyed the book and when I picked it up I invariably ended up reading for longer than I had set aside to do so. Clark Carlton has a nice and easy, readable style which is nicely balanced and not forcing too much descriptive prose onto the reader which can often be a real issue in 'alternate reality' style novels. Looking forward to the next installment.I do have to say that I received this book free through Goodreads First Reads."}, {"userName": "Matt Goodman", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9221536-matt-goodman", "userReview": "Prophets of the Ghost ants:As a VERY picky, lifelong fan of sci-fi & fantasy -- novels, movies and television, it gives me great joy to give a \"stand up and shout\" positive review of Prophets of the Ghost Ants. Where your typical sci-fi and fantasy novels tread all to familiar worlds filled with tired tropes and overtly named characters or are pulled from the worst of the Joseph Campbell school of heroes, Ghost Ants delivers not only in the fully realized world it pulls us into but also with characters that are yes, familiar, but also as fresh as the core concept itself.Set in an inconceivably far-flung future where Human beings are literally reduced ( shrunk actually, yes I know, but I got over this hitch in the concept quickly, it just works) to the bottom of the planetary ecosystem, the human societies of Ghost Ants are original in all the right places but also remind us of the rich tapestries of Herbert's Dune, Laloux's Fantastic Planet and Burroughs; John Carter of Mars series.In short, Ghost Ants is that rare gem of science-fiction -- as thought provoking and relevant as it is fantastical and entertaining. Poetic in tone, epically cinematic in scale, The heroic adventures of Annand, the simple \"roach boy\" who rises above his class to lead his people to freedom is just that...a revelation in well-wrought storytelling that screams for continued adventures. A sci-fi epic with a \"Vedic\" heart of anti-caste environmentalism, yet at its core, a rip-roaring action story filled with massive battles, \"giant\" monsters and the kind of castle intrigue and royal backstabbing akin to the classics, round out this rousing adventure tale.We are sure to see more of Annand and his fantastic world, the question now is... how long must we wait. I highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Maxine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine", "userReview": "Prophets of the Ghost Ants take place in a postapocalyptic world in which humans have shrunk to the size of insects. They also interact with insects - they domesticate some for food and riding, they even worship them, and too often they are killed by them.Anand is a member of the lowest caste in his colony, untouchable and unable to make a better life for himself or his family. However, when a new princess is born and the colony is splitting, by luck he is chosen to travel to the new tribe. On the way, the caravan is attacked and Anand finds himself in a new world where all men (and women) are equal, where people can worship who and what they want or nothing if they choose, where, even in war, killing is considered wrong.This is a very unique novel. Clarkson uses ant colonies to deal with such weighty issues as politics and religion and he manages to make them interesting. I should warn you, Clarkson is obviously not a fan of organized religion and its doctrines, something I have no problem with but, if you are one who takes offense at even a mild poke at religion, you might want to give this one a pass.There is also a lot of violence in this book although I didn't feel that any was gratuitous. There was also a lot of love - between Anand and his parents, between him and his friends and between him and Daveena, the woman he loves and who he must rescue from another, more warlike colony.I really liked this book - I liked the story, the characters, the action (although, honestly, I could have done with a little less of the bug feedings), its message but, most of all, I liked its intelligence. Definitely, a high recommendation from me!"}, {"userName": "T.K.

I couldn't put it down. It is blatantly clear that the author is an avid observer of bugs - everything from their appearance to their behaviour and everything in between. The tale itself can be described as a sort of 'coming of age' story, following the life and adventures of Anand, a young teenager in a world where humans have evolved to a size smaller than ants. Humans and insects live together in colonies, much like the ants and termites and roaches they live with. The sheer imagination of Clark Thomas Carlton's work is incredible. If you are squeamish, hate bugs, cannot fathom the idea of eating roach eggs or sucking the lymph from a mites leg, then don't read this book. This book has it all, from the intricate social structure Carlton created, to the imaginative culinary delights and to the jaw-dropping military tactics that had me flipping pages! To say this was Anand's story is just a pebble dropped in a pond. This was more of an ensemble tale that touched on several character's lives and weaved together through their association with Anand.

The catastrophes of distant ages -- natural and man-made -- have passed into legend and mysticism. And yet ... the world is no utopia. Technology is unknown. The animal kingdom as we know it is extinct. Birds, reptiles, mammals -- all lost to endless, unforgiving cycles of planetary death and rebirth. Humankind has clung stubbornly to existence -- thanks to a perverse turn of Evolution. For as the weary planet became inexorably depleted, our species adapted by growing smaller with every passing eon, until at last we stood in parity with the only other \u201chigher\u201d species to survive -- insects. And just as our current society has domesticated animals to sustain ourselves, the human societies of this future have yoked insects to their service. Food, weapons, clothing, art -- even the most sacred religious beliefs -- are derived from Humankind\u2019s profound intertwining with the once-lowly insect world. In this savage landscape, men cannot hope to dominate. Ceaselessly and viciously, humans are stalked by Night Wasps, Lair Spiders, and Grass Roaches. And men are still men. Corrupt elites ruthlessly enforce a rigid caste system over a debased and ignorant populace. Duplicitous clergymen and power-mongering Royalty wage pointless wars for their own glory. Fantasies of a better life, a better world, serve only to torment those who dare to dream. One so cursed is a half-breed slave named Anand, a dung-collector of the midden caste who, against all possibility, rises above hopelessness to lead his people against a genocidal army of men who fight atop fearsome, translucent Ghost Ants. And to his horror, Anand finds that this merciless enemy is led by someone from his own family ... a religious zealot bent on the conversion of all non-believers ... or their extermination.", "title": "Prophets of the Ghost Ants\n      \n          (Antasy #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11732092-prophets-of-the-ghost-ants", "average": 3.59, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1324471143l/11732092.jpg", "reviews": 67, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4938740.Clark_Thomas_Carlton", "name": "Clark Thomas Carlton"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Adventure", "Fiction", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11732092-prophets-of-the-ghost-ants", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33015187-prophets-of-the-ghost-ants", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33231127-prophets-of-the-ghost-ants", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11686412-prophets-of-the-ghost-ants", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16167009-prophets-of-the-ghost-ants", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23984449-the-illustrated-prophets-of-the-ghost-ants", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40041981-unti-carlton-3", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31448984-unti-carlton-2"]}
