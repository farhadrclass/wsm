Has opened up a whole new way of looking at things, and has sentences in it that stay with you for life, are now ingrained, branded, never to be forgotten? I have got to rate it with 5 stars. Its a short book but it packs a heavy punch and there are lessons a plenty!!This book is about a man, who one snowy day, encounters strangers and a plume of situations. He looks at all of these encounters with everyone from a totally different eye. An inside eye. He views everything from the heart, yet from a totally different perspective than what a lot of us do. He sees reason in everything that happens that day. He soul searches every encounter. In doing so, you the reader can identify with almost everything he says. Each chapter is a different experience that one snowy day, and by the end of each chapter, I was either crying or sitting there with my mouth agape, shaking my head up and down realizing, internally speaking, \"hey...that is me.. I really see that now! That makes total sense\".If you dont learn anything about life from this book, then there is no hope for you lol. Ok, there is always hope. My favorite scene was the chapter called, \"Beautiful Scars\". I was swept away by it and cried silently for a long time. I even had to set the book down for a few days, in order to process everything that was meant in that chapter, for us to understand. It followed so closely with my life. I think everyone will find that the situations in this book will mimic many marker events or just random times in ones life. How we handle them all, is the question.Mesmerized by this authors writing, in awe of his intelligence and heart, I feel there should be more books like this one available.One of the things many things said in this book that will stay with me the most was, \"Charlie told me once that my scars made me beautiful, that if I hadn't gone through all of that, then God couldn't have made me the person that I am..\" \"I had done plenty of things of which I wasn't proud. Harmful things, hurtful things. Things I wished I could take back and couldn't. Helen carried her scars on the outside but I carried mine on the inside. I would argue that they were much worse, but there was a God who still loved me...Little rotten, scarred me\". Now for those of you who are not Christian, I highly recommend this book anyway to you. It is so full of things that can help you to see things from a different prospective, perhaps one you have never considered before. It isn't about Christianity, it is about life, its lessons, where it takes us, where we wish to go, where we go that we never expected. This is a book for every single person alive. If we all read this book, society and the world would be a lovely place."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754448-brenda", "userReview": "Snow Day is Billy Coffey's reminds us that the important things in life aren't things at all, this little book reminds us of what is important. Filled with little stories about faith, wisdom, and kindness, and the overwhelming Love of God. Peter Boyd is just your average man, he has two children, a wife who works as a teacher, and a good job. But when the company sends a memo stating \"Exciting Announcement\" he fears the rumors that have been spreading are true, that he will be laid off at work. A major cause to worry when your job brings in 3/4ths of the family's income. So when the little town of Mattingly VA is blanketed with snow he decides that for one day he doesn't want to think about work, so he takes an emergency snow day. As with any major weather issue bread and milk are a must so his wife sends him off to the super center, which sound suspiciously like my Super Walmart, to do a bit of shopping. We follow him on his shopping expedition as he meets a cast of characters that reminds us of little life lessons. So Peter spends his snow day taking stock of his life, and realizes what is most important. Billy Coffey is a writer who was able to draw me right into the story and make me feel like I was right there with him, I could easily imagine him vying for the last loaves of bread, or the elderly gentleman yelling for help, I could just imagine the mad dash the workers made and the EMT hustling down the aisle to be of assistance! This story was written like several mini stories, the one thing that tied it together was Peter.While beautifully written this story doesn't tax the brain, it is very easy to follow and somewhat predictable, but the lessons in this book are priceless! I really enjoyed this book, and look forward to reading more from this talented writer! Even though I was provided a review copy of this book by Faith Words it in no way influenced my opinion of this book!"}, {"userName": "Hope", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71563445-hope", "userReview": "When I saw \u00a8Snow Day\u00a8 by Billy Coffey on the bookshelf I knew I had to read it. I saw the book a few weeks before christmas break and I thought it was an appropriate time to read it. I was looking for a book to get me into the christmas spirit, and this book was the perfect choice. When I read the back of the book I knew that it was going to be a very light-hearted easy book. This book was perfect because it was set up differently than the books I have recently read. I felt like I had been reading books that were very similar to each other, and I wanted a change. Even though the genre of the book is fiction, the plot was very different from what I tend to read, and enjoy. \t\u00a8Snow Day\u00a8 was a story about life, faith, and people. The main character, Peter, has a steady job at a factory, a wife, and two kids. His life is going pretty well until he hears a rumor that he might be getting laid off. Peters worries were held off by a huge snow storm that was hitting Virginia. He was forced to stay home from work that day and he couldn't get fired if he wasn't at work. Peters wife makes him go to the local supermarket to get milk and bread to have during the storm. Peter ends up spending the day people watching at the supermarket. He encounters many different people that all have a different story. All of the events he witnesses at the supermarket have an impact on Peter and his outlook on life. For example, Peter sees a man following a child around the store. He thinks that the man is going to hurt or take the child. As Peter was following him, he watched the man buy the toy that the kid asked his parents (who did not have enough money) for. The man snuck the toy into the kids car, and then watched how excited he was when he found it. Peter saw some amazing things and heard some very inspirational stories on his snow day trip. However, he also heard some stories of disappointment, and problems that were unresolved. When peter returned home he realized that it was the little things in life that matter the most, and everything will be okay if you have a strong sense of faith. \tI really liked how this book was set up. The entire story was just one day of Peter's life. This made the story feel like a short story, when really it was a novel. I also liked how it made you feel like you were there at the supermarket. All of the stories were told very clearly and it made you feel like you were connected to the characters. I also liked that all of the little stories, both the good and the sad, taught you a new lesson in life. The book was very inspirational. It was a \u00a8feel-good\u00a8 type of story and I really liked that. I definitely have a different outlook on life after reading this book. \tOne thing I did not love about the book was it was very fluffy. There was not much depth to the story which I didn't hate, but it did make it a little boring at times. Each new chapter was a different little inspirational story, and that got a little repetitive. I liked how many lessons I learned during this book, but some of the stories were predictable. As I was reading, I usually knew what was going to come next or how it was going to end."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1336988-wendy", "userReview": "A two-star rating seems to nicely sum up my reaction to this book: it was OK. It wasn't terrible, but I didn't really like it all that much and I really wanted to like it. I thought this would be inspiring and thought-provoking Christian fiction, based on the other reviews, but it's really more of a series of anecdotes that are forced together in the context of the main character's internal thoughts during an unexpected snow day. There is very little in the way of plot or characterization. Like some other reviewers have noted, the chapters would likely have worked better adapted into a series of devotionals.For me, the main character Peter came across as alternately whiny and proselytizing to humble and philosophical. I couldn't really get a read on his character. His wife and children are more cardboard-ish than the box the book came in and somehow, just about everyone in his town is a strong Christian who openly discusses their faith. Many parts of the book came across as unrealistic and contrived. For example, in one scene, Peter runs into an older couple in the SuperMart (aka, Walmart) whom he had never met before. Of course, they have deep conversation in the aisle about how she got the scars on her face, why his leg was amputated and how they ended up meeting, falling in love, and getting married. In the same store, he strikes up conversation with a young couple who then relate their financial hardships and agony over disappointing their young son at Christmas. He starts yet another conversation with an older man who anonymously buys that couple's son a toy and leaves it for him in their unlocked car. All of this in a SuperMart during the mad scramble of the holiday season in the midst of a snow storm. Um, OK.I am sorry to say that I found the story a bit too sappy and contrived for my taste. It's a sweet story, but almost to the point of syrupy sweet. I ended up skimming/skipping the last 1/3 or so of the book to see if there were any big revelations at the end that would make reading the rest of the book worthwhile. No such luck. I appear to be in the minority of people who didn't love this book. I think it will appeal to those looking for a story that's an easy read with a strong Christian message. Readers who can get past the fact that many of the scenes seemed to be artificiality built to house a particular message will likely enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Charlene", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66616-charlene", "userReview": "I'll be thinking about this book for a while. I complain that there are few mentions of God & faith & their role in modern life in contemporary fiction. Now, with this book, I am going to complain that this novel is almost too much about those things. It is short, well written but there's not the depth I was hoping for in the main character. But then . . . character is in his early 30s and he goes as deep, or deeper, in his reflections than I was doing at that age so perhaps not a fair criticism.  I also thought perhaps the setting rang true -- a young couple with rural background and values who are just at the edge of a world morphing into subdivisions and lack of community.  The story that will stay with me is Bobby's and how he lost his faith after his mission trip to help out in New Orleans after Katrina. One of the few stories that doesn't wrap up sweetly in the epilogue. Book really reads more like short vignettes or stories that have been put together. I was really expecting more from it as a novel."}, {"userName": "Ausjenny", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1100486-ausjenny", "userReview": "This is a very good read. Peter wakes up to snow the schools have called a snow day and Peter decides to take one also. Peter is looking at maybe having his job cut or decreased and things look bleak.Being as I have never seen snow fall I found some of the things in this book interesting one being how everyone wants milk and bread. This leads to encounters with many different people during the day and little life lessons happen with many of these meetings. I found the insights and truths he found from the different encounters quite interesting and ones that can be applied to my own life. The different perspectives on the same idea, item or thought can be interesting also. Alot happens in one day but it was a day of discovery and a really good read with alot of humor in the story telling.

His reflections are unassuming and could easily echo any one of our own internal dialogues e.g. his thoughts about possible layoffs at work, about his neighbors and his small town community, what he has to be grateful for, how small acts parallel the larger circumstances and choices we make in life etc. Despite the clearly Christian theme of relating to God etc., the book isn't preachy or proselytizing in tone and could appeal to readers of any religion or none. In fact, I thought its appeal derives mainly from its home-grown sense of humanity and wisdom which I found very comforting. A highly recommended read."}, {"userName": "K.M.

In a series of gentle, folksy vignettes he presents a protagonist who is lost in the same, ordinary way we all are and uses his observations and discoveries to shed a little light on our common plight: life.

For me it was \"It's a wonderful life\" meets Max Lucado. :) I really appreciated the author's journey in this book, that with each person he meets, there is a new lesson to be learned. To me that is where the \"Max Lucado\" comes in. If you have ever read any of his books, you will know that he is a master at bringing the scriptures alive in common place situations. I love that. I feel that Mr. Coffey does that equally as well and in story form, I love that too. I felt utterly encouraged as I listened to this book (I got the audiobook version), because I felt that if we open our \"spiritual eyes\" a bit that we too can truly learn some spiritual lessons from the folks that we encounter every day. We just have to take the time to truly see the people and hear God teach us the lessons. It's a slower paced story but it's truly worth it.

Billy Coffey does an incredible job of making the reader think outside the box and has them smell the flowers along the way. Snow Days has the feel of the movie A Christmas Story and Forest Gump combined. Peter Boyd wakes up to see fresh snow. He decides to take the day off from work and enjoy this snow day with his family. His wife asks him to go to the store for bread and milk to will help them through the snow storm. On his way to Super Mart, Peter begins to look at the world around him and starts to see things as if for the very first time. He spots a superman costume for his son that would be perfect for Christmas. He recalls why he and his dad wanted to be this super hero, \"Who could blame us? Being able to fly faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound had its advantages...\" Something then caught Peter Boyd's eye as he looked over the costume, \"Caution, wearing this costume will not enable you to fly...I read it twice and burst out laughing...Why in the world would such a warning need to be put on a costume?...the warning couldn't have been for the child; all the sizes were so small that whoever was wearing it would surely not be old enough to read and even if they could, what kids reads, the tags on his clothes?...This left the parents...\" Snow Days is full of these little bits and so much more. I loved this book. I lived up north and experienced snow days as a kid. They really do force people to slow down and take the time to see the world anew; to look at things they normally don't have time to notice. It's amazing what we discover around us when we take the time to look, or hear the things we don't take the time to listen to -- like the still, small voice in our heart that's trying to get our attention. Peter Boyd's hearing and vision changed forever that day. He hears and sees God speaking to him in a very simple way, \"I made the world such that no one can survive it alone. Some try. Some even think it can be done. But it can't. Love one another: I didn't just say that one time a couple thousand years ago. I say that every day. Love is an action word. It means doing something...\" During Peter's adventures on this snow day, he looks at God, love, people and his family differently. Peter finds a renewed hope, encouragement and zest for life in the most unexpected places. You'll laugh, be surprised, experience tender moments and be very encouraged as you read Snow Day. I was!

It was supposed to last his entire career, but now there are layoffs and he only wonders how much longer they will keep him on.

He begins to shift his focus onto the things that matter and not those that are superficial. Throughout the day, Peter encounters God and experiences a shift in his life that he didn\u2019t expect.For his first novel, this book is great. The story is told seamlessly and fun to follow along. Even though it is not suspenseful, I found myself wanted to start the next chapter to see what was going to unfold next in Peter\u2019s day. Peter could be anyone of us, really. The problems that he encounters could happen to anyone. The same can be said for the reactions that Peter has to other\u2019s problems around us. Not everyone is this way, but I know a lot of people that would rather just \u201cpray for someone\u201d rather than go actually talk to them and have a conversation with them. I just found this book to be really enjoyable.This book is not supernatural in the way that his other novels are. He does receive a message from God, but it is very believable.

I remember the feeling of freedom and excitement at having a whole day off from school to play and have fun in the snow. That is why this book was instantly appealing to me. I also had high expectations going into this book; expectations that were largely unmet. This book starts out with the world\u2019s longest, and I must say, strangest trip to \u201cWalmart\u201d. I don\u2019t know about most people, but when I go to Walmart I just want to get my stuff and get out of there. I found it a bit odd that Peter was watching people so much, even following people and asking them questions. It all seemed a bit of a stretch. But, thankfully that was only part of the story.One of the things I did enjoy very much about Snow Day is the contrast between the fun and innocence of childhood and the stress and harshness of adulthood. The two worlds came together on a day when Peter was willing and open to learning a few things about life and himself. The Christian message was strong during those moments, almost too strong. Sometimes this book read more like a Christian self-help book than a novel, but I really don\u2019t see any harm in that.Overall, I would say I have mixed feelings about Snow Day. I do feel that it is very well written and Billy Coffey is an author I would like to read again one day.

Peter is a family man and factory worker whose life has been going along as usual, except that when we meet him he has grave concerns for his future. Because of the unstable economic climate there is rumour of possible upcoming lay-offs, and he is worried about his job. The decision he makes to take the day off work on a stormy winter day just before Christmas is a decision that changes his life.

While shopping for snow day necessities of bread and milk at the Super Center (a thinly disguised Wal-mart), he meets a couple who force him to look at more than the exterior, a suspicious man who shows him the real meaning of Christmas, takes an enlightening trip around his yard while pulling his children on their sled, learns that sometimes life is worth the risk from the local sledding hill, and realized that his life is more than just the information on a job application. Coffey's writing captures the wonder and joy of a snow day as well as the creeping fear of a thirty-something man trying to do the best he can for his family and wondering if he'll every do anything worthwhile. Snow Day is a thoughtful essay about what's truly important in life. Pete makes discoveries about life that will make readers smile and nod their heads in understanding. This thoroughly enjoyable slim volume will be sure to thrill readers looking for a great holiday read."}, {"userName": "Sherri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277671-sherri", "userReview": "This book is really a collection of modern day parables that a preacher might use in a sermon. First off, every person that this guy comes into contact with is somehow a devout Christian that uses God and the Lord in conversation like the words are going out of style. A little unrealistic, don't ya think? Some of these people's stories were interesting, but the main character's interpretation of them after the fact, relating them to his life in some sort of epiphany, became overdone and boring. I literally wanted to shut him up. If I hadn't been listening to an audio book, I might have skimmed the text to avoid these long-winded sections.The worst part came when a cashier wouldn't say, \"Merry Christmas.\" The poor main character went into a freak fit because he couldn't stand the phrase \"Happy Holidays.\" I lost any respect I had for him at that point. Then to top it off with a quick epilogue after the situation was resolved, saying that the store goes under a complete change the following Christmas, bringing baby Jesus back in and Merry Christmas with him. This man's flipping out made all this possible. Who would fall for such drivel?I was relieved when this book ended. It's the lowest quality of Christian literature that I've read. Perhaps this author should write a companion to the Bible or something along those lines. It would be more up his alley."}, {"userName": "Terry Ikoma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50543650-terry-ikoma", "userReview": "I wasnt sure what this was going to be about . .

And most often that is from family and friends. I would pick a family game night over a trip to the movies any time now. Having coffee with the locals as they share their wisdom of hard times is much richer than reading the big town papers of what is happening in the world. I have found that same kind of thinking in the book 'Snow Day' by Billy Coffey. He noticed a balance in rural America that shows that we are a community of neighbors, co-workers and strangers turned friends. This is just like listening to the story telling my grandfather use to do. Here during a particularly bad snow storm Peter Boyd calls in to work to take a Snow Day. During this day his eyes are opened to the community around him. And that becomes a reflection to his own life. It reminds me of when College Girl was younger. We had Dr. Mom days. Times that we called in to school for a doctors appointment to really have a day with mom. One that seemed to really bring back health to our own relationship that was important as a day learning in class."}, {"userName": "Diane  Sugars", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5738109-diane-sugars", "userReview": "I loved this book so much! It is one of those books that just leaves you with so much that you want to read it again! Snow Day made me smile and most of all...THINK! We all have those moments (whether we admit to them or not, I am a believer so I admit them to them each and everytime they happen to me) when God does something that hits us right on the head to make us THINK! Or to make us change our actions, or to change our thoughts, or words or God sends someone to us to brighten our day. One day for me I was having a HORRIBLE day just downright horrible and God sent this little angel and that angel stopped, looked at me and said...I think you need a hug and gave me the biggest hug. Some people will say that was just a coincidence, but I am a believer, and I beleive that person was sent to me by God to help me! Snow day is just that book to make you think. If you are a beleiver you should read this book! If you are a nonbeleiver, you should read this book! Then let me know what you thought! I cannot wait to read more of Billy Coffey's work!"}, {"userName": "Chera DeHoff", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39500181-chera-dehoff", "userReview": "Billy Coffey brings a lot of spiritual enlightenment to the surface in his book, Snow Day. On the brink of losing his job, Peter takes a snow day only to find little hints of the wonder of his life within the interactions that ensue. A trip to the grocery store to get the necessities (milk and bread) makes him ponder many things \u2026 he sees the magic of giving, learns the importance of \u201cit\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that matters\u201d, sees that God puts us places in our lives for reasons, and he learns to not be afraid to ask for help, no matter what. On the way home, he gets further insight \u2026 money can\u2019t buy you happiness, some of us are playing hide and seek with God, and God never gives us more than we can handle. At home, he relishes in the delight of his children \u2026 he takes a walk, meets yet more people to signify that he is going to be okay. And he was okay \u2026 we have to take what we can, and leave the rest.I liked this little story of seeking answers when one feels all is lost.

He meets a loving senior couple in the store; she is badly scarred by burns and he limps, and their devotion to each other is evident.

To him, those constants are the factory where he works, the family he loves, and the God who sustains him. But when news of job cuts comes against the backdrop of an unexpected snowstorm, his life becomes filled with far more doubts than certainties. With humor and a gift for storytelling, Billy Coffey brings you along as he spends his snow day encountering family, friends, and strangers of his small Virginia town. All have had their own battles with life's storms. Some have found redemption. Others are still seeking it. But each one offers a piece to the puzzle of why we must sometimes suffer loss, and each one will help Peter find a greater truth--our lives are made beautiful not by our big moments, but our little ones.", "title": "Snow Day", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7938929-snow-day", "average": 3.59, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344266845l/7938929.jpg", "reviews": 133, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3448642.Billy_Coffey", "name": "Billy Coffey"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Holiday", "Christian Fiction", "Inspirational", "Spirituality"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7938929-snow-day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11026746-snow-day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19225594-snow-day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16124135-when-mockingbirds-sing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23647121-the-curse-of-crow-hollow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126902-the-devil-walks-in-mattingly", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11968618-paper-angels", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21556062-in-the-heart-of-the-dark-wood"]}
