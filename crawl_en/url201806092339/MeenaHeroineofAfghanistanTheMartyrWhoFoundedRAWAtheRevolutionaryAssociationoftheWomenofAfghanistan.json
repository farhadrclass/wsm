(it's not: memorisation of the qur'an is an art and being a hafez, or knowing it by heart, is a high achievement. the qur'an is a poem and listening to a recitation would show anyone of this art - it's intensely moving.)add to that the irritating 'west is best' attitude and her distinct underplay of america's historic role in afghanistan and her obvious anti-russian jingoism (not saying that russia doesn't have their hands very bloody when it comes to afghanistan, only that i don't trust americans who demonise russia), and it becomes easy not to like this book too much. i would say be very careful when reading this book. read it through the biggest critical filter you can muster. it's often in the most 'innocent' or unlikely of places that propaganda is spread.alternatively, commission another person more knowledgeable to write about meena and RAWA."}, {"userName": "*\u2022.\u2665.\u2022*  Fleur Rebelle *\u2022.\u2665.\u2022*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4307978-fleur-rebelle", "userReview": "Madame Nooria showed the girls statistics that proved Afghanistan was one of the very few nations on earth where women lived shorter lives than men.

Meena seems to have been an inspiring woman with an amazing story, and once I was drawn into her biography I devoured it quickly. As a literary work, though, Chavis doesn't do the story any favors; the book reads like a ten-year-old's book report and Chavis routinely breaks the narrative to explain simple concepts. I wasn't sure, reading this, what was going on: was she writing for a younger audience (like, jr. high young)? Were some of these concepts exotic when the book was written 6 years ago? Was she just being patronizing, or did she have reason to believe that we were culturally clueless? Whatever the reason, I didn't require any of the following defined or explained: pomegranates, naan, Jack London, Cassandra, lyc\u00e9es... Chavis's sentences are choppy and the writing is stilted and overly formal.None of this, however, should stop anyone from reading \"Meena, Heroine of Afghanistan.\" The story of someone fighting for women's rights under turmoil and the authoritarian regimes that have plagued Afghanistan for decades is well worth enduring some stilted writing..and 50 pages into it I mostly forgot about how it was written and became immersed in the events of Meena's life."}, {"userName": "James F", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f", "userReview": "An inspiring biography of Meena, written shortly after the history by Brodsky, which it seems to be partly based on, although it has other information. This is written in a simpler, less academic style; although for adults, it would not be out of place in a high school library or Young Adult collection. The author was apparently not well-informed about Afghanistan before Sept. 11, and the book somewhat reflects a US (though not a US government) perspective, in that the US role in supporting the jehadi is mentioned but not especially emphasized, and the crimes of the Soviet occupation are dealt with more fully than those of the jehadi (although since Meena was killed before the Soviet pullout, this is somewhat understandable). It's still a good book, but I think it's one I would recommend mainly to high school students, and the Brodsky book to adults."}, {"userName": "Danica Northend", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5109401-danica-northend", "userReview": "This is one of the highlighted read of 2007. The book was well written and aimed to portray the real story of a real woman, leaving any imposed political agenda out of the biography.

The book was enlightening, inspiring, and best of all, very true."}, {"userName": "Shauna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/590949-shauna", "userReview": "Deceptively simple because it has a powerful impact.

There were, at first, a bit too many instances of, \"and at that moment, at 15, Meena was deciding too.....\" I sort of shut down reading a biography when the biography takes those kinds of careless liberties. That said, it's a good story. A good companion to Charlie Wilson's War (and it really brings to light the problems with having the American support via Pakistan go to the more extremist mujaheddin, touche on in Charlie Wilson's War, but covered in a more first-person account here). I know it's hard to be critical of someone who was a true martyr but, at times, Meena was really acting more pathological than brave (not letting her daughter have a doll? working till she dropped while pregnant? these aren't things to necessarily celebrate in her character). In any case, these are great women doing great work. After finishing I looked them up online to see what had become of them, as it sounds like their work is far from over, and the need for them is really at its greatest."}, {"userName": "Rainey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1995915-rainey", "userReview": "Let me be straightforward: this is a book to read. It's a great story, an eye-opener about Afghani history and culture, and an inspiration. It's also a quick, easy read that you can undertake in a single weekend. It details the life of a woman who sacrificed everything (including her life and the chance to raise her children) to bring literacy, democracy and gender equality to Afghanistan. While she was murdered before she could see her dream of Afghanistan come to fruition, her life is an inspiration to people around the globe.Nonetheless, this book won't go down in history as a stunning masterpiece. The writing is simple and plain. Reading it, I always felt like there was something missing. This book seemed to be the skeleton of a book, an outline. If you read this book, be sure to purchase it first-hand so that proceeds can go to the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan.

Trouble is the writing style was a bit overly sentimental in places and the beginning was stilted with far too much time spent on Meena's near-fatal childhood illness. That said once the book gets going it doesn't stop. It continually boggles the mind the level of courage shown by not only Meena, but all the women of RAWA in fighting first the Soviet puppet government that took power and imprisoned, tortured, and killed intellectuals and dissenters; and then the American-supported Islamic fundamentalist regime that brutally repressed all the women and religious minorities in the region. This is a story that needed telling and it is right and just that the proceeds from the book should go to RAWA's modern incarnation."}, {"userName": "Rohit Harip", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22555694-rohit-harip", "userReview": "MEENA - HEROINE OF AFGANISTANA story of afgan girl who struggled from her school days to saught the freedom formely from USSR and later from Taliban.

I was so happy to read the story of an amazing woman as there are few female models whose stories are known to inspire women, but also men. As a teacher, Meena's life provides many lessons I can pass on to my students - challenging their ideas about gender, seeing history through the life of one individual and how she chose to respond to it, and the example of a purposeful life. I strongly recommend Meena to anyone who wants to learn more about Afghanistan, RAWA, or how individuals and organizations can grow to make lasting impacts in the world."}, {"userName": "Amina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7933431-amina", "userReview": "The only downside, if you can call it that is how short it is. Understandably it is hard to find any concrete paperwork on Menna such as personal diaries etc as such items were too risky to keep around under the Taliban. The author however with such restrictive resources and only second-hand accounts from family and friends does a great job in telling Meena's story.
