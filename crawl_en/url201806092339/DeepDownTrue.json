I have not read \"Shelter Me,\" yet, but I am planning to go back and read it at some point. I think that most women, no matter what stage they are in their lives, will find something to identify with in this book. Fay does an excellent job of illustrating those passages of life that we all go through, first as daughters, then as friends, wives, mothers and even grandmothers, to some extent. There are certain aspects of life that are intrinsic to being a woman, and I really felt drawn to Fay's descriptions, identifying with parts of my life that I have experienced.The main character, Dana Stellgarten is a recent divorcee, with two children - Morgan and Grady. Struggling to find her post-divorce identity, she struggles with a number of family issues (I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil the plot), while trying to figure out who she wants to become. Fay describes Dana's relationships with her kids, her sister, her niece, her ex-husband and also her friends and neighbors with such great detail, in such a way that I felt I was practically living in the same town, and could have been friends with her. Through all of her struggles, Dana learns some hard, but valuable lessons about relationships and the true meaning of love and friendship. I highly recommend this book to people who like Kristin Hannah and Anita Shreve."}, {"userName": "Jacki (Julia Flyte)", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095931-jacki-julia-flyte", "userReview": "This is the story of Dana, the recently divorced mother of two children, who is struggling to come to terms with her newly single status. Over the course of the book she goes from being hurt and raw to finding a way for her and her children to move forward. She has to assume responsibility for herself financially, find a way to accept her husband's new relationship and to help her children to move on - as well as learning to move forward romantically.I didn't particularly enjoy this book. Most of the storyline felt as cliched as the book's generic title. Dana was just too bland and perfect to hold my interest. Almost everything that came out of her mouth felt like how magazine articles recommend that you behave. Plus, the idea that she was this recently divorced woman who thought that it was entirely reasonable that her ex-husband should support her as a full time mother because she was just too busy looking after a 12 year old and 6 year old, didn't sit well with me. Nor did her inability to spot what a loser her boyfriend was or how passive aggressive her supposed best friend was. I kept waiting for some dramatic twist but it all unfolds pretty much as you expect it to.I can see the way that the author tried to integrate lots of real life issues - eating disorders, teenage sexual pressures, suicide - but they all felt like they'd been deep fried in vanilla. The fact that it took me two weeks to read this book is indicative of its inability to hold my interest. It's not that it's particularly terrible, it's just...bland."}, {"userName": "Lenore Webb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2651311-lenore-webb", "userReview": "In Deep Down True feels like your reading your own inner diary. Not so much the events as much as the feelings. We are all still sorta like a awkward 13 year old inside. Praying to be accepted by others. Wanting to show our independence and being fearful of not achieving just that. Even as grown women with our own kids and life experiences, things get knotted up inside at times. And then just when we have had enough it seems something else is piled on top. Finally we blow and pieces of life go flying about, scattering about. Yes we sweep up the mess and put things back together. But most often we find that it is best to see that not everything lines right back up. And here in Deep Down True, that is just the way it falls. Like real life. Like it is us there. Like we can touch those feelings, wants and fears."}, {"userName": "Laura Kay Bolin", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5159657-laura-kay-bolin", "userReview": "Dana Stellgarten, is a newly divorced mom trying to balance all the things in her life her kids, her ex-husband, her daughter\u2019s eating disorder, dating, friendships, working, and family. This is simply no easy task. Dana has this very sweet personality and wants to be nice to everyone. She even makes sure to volunteer to prepare meals to families who are dealing with catastrophic illness. The problems seem to grow and she can no longer be sweet Dana. Her ex-husband seems surprised when he isn\u2019t always met by nice Dana, as if he doesn\u2019t understand his actions have caused her an insurmountable amount of stress and being on her own to deal with it all. Once she stops being so nice and becomes more real it gives those around her the chance to see the real Dana. It is only when she is Deep down true to herself does Dana begin to find herself and happiness. I enjoyed Deep Down True from the first to the last page. Even though I\u2019m not a divorced mom, I found I connected to Dana Stellgarten just as a mom. The story, the characters, and most importantly the subject matter is simply relatable! I felt the characters were more than just relatable but believable. They could be the family that lives just down the street.

The edges were too smooth in a story where there was so much opportunity to make Dana a little less even. I would have enjoyed seeing the ragged become flattened by reason instead of seeing a well-rounded woman become minorly unhinged; but never enough to curl my gut with empathy.

At\u00e9 que dei por mim a ver clich\u00e9s em todo o lado, enredos quase sempre com o mesmo esquema. Enfim, pensei que estava na hora de p\u00f4r uma pausa na minha leitura puramente romanceada durante uns tempos. E depois os que fui lendo aqui e ali s\u00f3 me davam vontade de revirar os olhos e pensar que este g\u00e9nero de leitura j\u00e1 n\u00e3o era para mim.Posto isto, este livro veio parar-me \u00e0s m\u00e3os por acaso. Como prenda de Natal mais propriamente. E j\u00e1 se sabe que tudo o que vem \u00e0 rede \u00e9 peixe e resolvi dar uma oportunidade. N\u00e3o podia estar mais bem surpreendida!

A escrita, sendo um livro ainda grande, \u00e9 muito boa. Possibilitou-me ler este livro num \u00e1pice como se nada fosse. E o enredo\u2026 ahahahah s\u00f3 de me lembrar de certas situa\u00e7\u00f5es que a autora criou j\u00e1 me d\u00e1 vontade de rir. Dei por mim um dia no comboio a tapar a boca para n\u00e3o me desmanchar. E normalmente com livros de humor fico-me por um sorriso enviesado. Dana \u00e9 uma m\u00e3e rec\u00e9m-divorciada.

E no meio de tudo isto, Dana ainda tem de tomar conta da sua agenda amorosa e social que parece ter crescido nos \u00faltimos tempos. H\u00e1 situa\u00e7\u00f5es verdadeiramente hilariantes, e ao mesmo tempo problemas s\u00e9rios que nos fazem pensar o que far\u00edamos se algum dia nos v\u00edssemos na mesma situa\u00e7\u00e3o que Dana.

The story is about Dana, a 45-year-old woman who is still reeling from her divorce from a year ago. She's has two kids, 12-year-old Morgan and 7-year-old Grady, while her former husband, Kenneth, has moved on with Tina, a 29-year-old bimbo. I had more issues with this book than the newsstand at the local airport. Sign #1 was when Dana complains to Coach Ro, the screaming Neanderthal who coaches Grady's kiddie football team, that she mistakenly thinks Grady wants to be called by his name and not \"Stelly\" -- a take on their last name, Stellgarten. Let that sink in a bit. A third-grader who DOESN'T want a cool nickname? And mom complaining to the coach about it? Am I right? Yeah, FAIL. I understand the author was trying to create a way for the coach and Dana to meet-cute but I just couldn't see that happening. No. 2, and I hope I don't offend anyone with this, but a key part of the plot is when Kenneth tells Dana that sales at his company are lagging due to a recent scandal so he's going to have to reduce the amount of child support she receives and could she get a job to help make up the difference. And what does she do? She gets mad. MAD. I'm not divorced and therefore have not received child support but is there an expectation that the divorced spouse never has to work again when you get these monthly payments, even when the kids are in school and daytime childcare is not an issue? This change in finances does get Dana out of the house -- for a part-time job at her kids' dentist office -- and is all part of the narrative of how this character starts to take control of her life again but for someone to get MAD that they have to work stopped me in my tracks.The rest of the book has an ensemble of characters like Adler, Dana's niece, who is struggling to get along with her acidic, blowhard of a mom Connie (Dana's sister) and Coach Ro, who is briefly a romantic interest but one of the oafish, mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging variety. Kenneth the ex-husband comes around really wanting to boss Dana around as if he still lives at the house. As an aside, I always imagine him looking like Thelma's husband from Thelma & Louise, sort of aggressively stupid and all. There's the dentist that gives Dana a job, the kindly Dr. Anthony Sakimoto who becomes her friend and confidante, the various staff at the dentist office that support him, Polly, her BFF, who it turns out isn't that much of of a friend and the various other people Dana meets as she tries on this newly-divorced-woman thing on for size. Lastly there are the issues with Morgan who is struggling with an eating disorder that originally Dana ignores (way to go, mom) and also trying to navigate middle school in which all the girls sound like they're auditioning for a role on \"Dynasty: The Tween Years.\"I'm all for books about a woman finding herself after many years caring for others but it's hard to believe that someone would make so many mistakes in character assessment all because they were once married and suffer from Nice To A Fault Syndrome. I felt the writing was a little weighty and the dialogue could have been snappier. There were no extraneous plotlines but it felt like a slog just to get through them all. Maybe it's because I'm not a suburban white woman rocked by divorce and managing children but this was a book I would have a hard time recommending to anyone because so little of it I could connect with or the women I know."}, {"userName": "Mary Pessaran", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5327924-mary-pessaran", "userReview": "I so loved \"Shelter Me,\" Juliette Fay's first book, that I had high expectations of her second. Her writing is superb, the characters multi-dimensional, and the conflicts believable. In particular, I like her male characters. I had to root for Tony Sakimoto, his humor,generosity and patience are characteristics we'd like to see in every potential love interest.It is obvious that the author is a mother because her portrayal of the children in her books are true to nature. She displays both the joys and the difficulties of parenting.In \"Shelter Me,\" I felt completely involved with Janie, the main character, and the challenges she encountered following her husband's death. In this story, I felt that Dana's story was somewhat diluted by the number of trajectories for the conflict. Dana deals with her daughter's bulimia, her ex-husband's betrayal and his building a new family, her niece's boyfriend issues and the niece's estrangement from her mother, a stranger's terminal illness, resolving her father's death, a tenuous relationship with her sister, financial issues and dating following her divorce.A good book.

Achei formid\u00e1vel a forma honesta como a autora, Juliette Fay, explorou a vida desta mulher, o modo como nos permite aceder de forma bastante \u00edntima \u00e0s suas percep\u00e7\u00f5es, esperan\u00e7as e receios. Particularmente, gostei de ter acesso ao contraste entre o que Dana gostaria realmente de dizer e a resposta pela qual acaba por optar\u2026 Fazemos isto tantas vezes no nosso dia-a-dia e, apesar de por vezes termos vontade de responder mal a algu\u00e9m, mesmo sendo bemmerecido (!), acabamos normalmente por escolher a resposta mais educada e que nos vai trazer menos problemas, mas mantendo aquela deliciosamente despreocupada ideia \"e se eu agora te mandasse simplesmente para l\u00e1\u2026!?\"Fay recheou este livro com problemas familiares e pessoais bem profundos, v\u00e1lidos tanto na adolesc\u00eancia como na vida adulta, presenteando-nos diversas vezes com a interessant\u00edssima contrariedade da perspectiva m\u00e3e/filha. Desde as falsas expectativas que a sociedade actual nos leva a formar sobre a nossa apar\u00eancia f\u00edsica, passando pelas sequelas do div\u00f3rcio nos filhos bem como a sua resposta \u00e0s tentativas dos pais retomarem as suas vidas amorosas com outras pessoas, a descoberta da sexualidade na adolesc\u00eancia, o consumo de drogas e a perda de um familiar por doen\u00e7a terminal, Juliette Fay aborda temas muito sens\u00edveis e interessantes, pecando talvez, e este \u00e9 o \u00fanico ponto negativo que tenho a apontar, por querer abordar demasiadas adversidades no mesmo livro. De qualquer das formas, gostei muito mais deste livro do que estava inicialmente \u00e0 espera. Fay levou-me a simpatizar realmente com as suas personagens e a torcer por um final feliz para cada uma delas, passando pela compreens\u00e3o dos seus dilemas e escolhas. Gostei do lembrete de que nunca temos realmente a certeza de estar a fazer o \"melhor\" mas que podemos garantir o \"nosso melhor\", o nosso esfor\u00e7o m\u00e1ximo, e que isso j\u00e1 conta bastante. A autora mostra como as mesmas pessoas podem trazer doses de alegria e tristeza/desilus\u00e3o \u00e0s nossas vidas e que \u00e9 a forma como decidimos lidar com isso que condiciona o futuro dessas rela\u00e7\u00f5es.

Her husband left her for another woman, now she struggles to make ends meet, to deal with the lonely times when her kids are with their dad, and to reinvent herself as something other than a wife. She is the consummate caretaker, always putting the others (even her son's flirtatious football coach) before herself. As her teenage daughter points out, Dana is nice to a fault. Suddenly without the safety net of marriage Dana has to find strength she has buried deep to protect her children, find a job, help out her confused Goth niece, and maybe even let romance back into her life.At first I found the plot of Deep Down True to be utterly commonplace and predictable and I was a bit bored. Dana's story is that of nearly every woman who has gone through a divorce. After awhile though I began to really like Dana and to feel like she was a friend. Then her everyday triumphs started to matter to me and by the end I had really enjoyed the book. Watching Dana's daughter Morgan struggle through her parents' divorce in such a vulnerable way with Dana trying to find her way to a solution was painful and rewarding all at once. There are some great humorous moments, often thanks to Grady's football coach, that help to lighten the mood. In the end I enjoyed the book but wish it had been pruned down a little.I listened to the audio version of Deep Down True, read by Robynn Rodriguez.

I enjoyed this novel more than Shelter Me but that might be because the whole story was much more believable for me."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43091-jenny", "userReview": "One of my favorite books! I loved it! It is a touching struggle of this woman, Dana, to get control of her life after divorce, and provide for her 2 children. Plus there is also a struggle to decide if she wants to meet other people (men specifically) and date. The book touches on many sensitive subjects, anorexia and bulimia just to mention a couple; plus the death of a friend, sex and dating after divorce, divorce and infidelity and all are handled tastefully.It is entertaining, and I found myself rooting for the main character, Dana, every time she got into a situation. You root for her to find the right guy and I was very happy with the way the book ended."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/740538-heather", "userReview": "Well-written, with likeable characters, but a predictable plot (though not so much so that the book was ruined for me). The main character, Dana, is very warm and appealing and I found her confusion over how to treat her daughter's incipent eating disorder very realistic. In fact, I found all of her parenting conundrums realistic, and not cartoonish; I find that refreshing, since a lot of novels' descriptions of parenting make me wonder if the author has ever actually spoken to a real child before. As a mother, I very much like not being patronized to or made a charactature of, so that was a large part of this book's appeal."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/447568-heather", "userReview": "Love the cover...it is why I picked it up! And, it ended too soon. I ended up really liking this book...even though there was more language than I like. It was a such a good slice of life with a middle schooler, very realistic look at people. It is the story of a recently divorced mother of two 8th grade and 6th grade, and the roller coaster of dealing with divorce, going back to work, teenagers and just life in general. It woudl make a good beach read, as it is a little brainless, but it was just nice to curl up at home and read something enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Amy Hatvany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2178507-amy-hatvany", "userReview": "An expertly crafted, subtle but straightforward look into the complicated world of middle school aged girls, life after divorce and the challenges of a blended family. Fay deftly leads the reader through these rocky terrains with a gentle hand and a supremely perceptive sense of humor. I loved how she mirrored the \"mean girl\" dynamics with the protagonist and her own set of women friends, making me question just how far we mature out of our junior high selves. A wonderful follow up to Shelter Me!"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/805276-jen", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. Despite a lot of content that I can't personally relate to, the characters and plot were so well written and realistic that I found I could relate to them anyway. I really liked the idea of Dana, the main character learning to be LESS nice. I know a few doormats like myself, who could sometimes stand to learn that lesson. This is a book that will make you laugh and cry and root for a happy ending."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4502133-amy", "userReview": "My Mom gave me this book when she was visiting and didn't say anything glowing about it so I wasn't expecting much. I really liked it though! It's a great perspective of a Mom and middle school & high school age girls. (Something I'm dreading dealing with in the future...) I ended up staying up WAY too late last night to finish it but a great happy ending and a LOT of characters to like - something I haven't been able to say with the last couple of books I've read! :)"}, {"userName": "Renae", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1640431-renae", "userReview": "This is another home run by Fay. Her writing style is so so readable. \"Dana\" is someone just like you and me with everyday and real problems. The kids in this story are perfectly real as well. This book was so much fun to read and I'd recommend it to anyone. I hope Fay has another book to share with us soon!"}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1898046-brenda", "userReview": "This story was an everyday soap opera. The story was just like real life with many ups and downs. The overall story pulled me as a reader in and made the characters seem like your small-town neighbors and friends. This book ended on a high note, but I still would of liked it if it would of ended differently.

Lackluster plot, and if you listen to the audio book the narrator will drive you nuts! She did me, anyway. Absolutely distasteful. She made everyone but the main character sound exactly the same....brassy and unlike anyone you might consider bonding with. The men, the women, the children, all jarringly harsh.

Newly divorced Dana Stellgarten has always been unfailingly nice- even to telemarketers-but now her temper is wearing thin. Money is tight, her kids are reeling from their dad's departure, and her Goth teenage niece has just landed on her doorstep. As she enters the slipstream of post-divorce romance and is befriended by the town queen bee, Dana finds that the tension between being true to yourself and being liked doesn't end in middle school... and that sometimes it takes a real friend to help you embrace adulthood in all its flawed complexity.", "title": "Deep Down True", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8932520-deep-down-true", "average": 3.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1311702585l/8932520.jpg", "reviews": 339, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1956954.Juliette_Fay", "name": "Juliette Fay"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary", "Womens Fiction", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8932520-deep-down-true", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18712088-acasos-do-amor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10116758-deep-down-true", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4701057-shelter-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542833-the-shortest-way-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274322-the-tumbling-turner-sisters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
