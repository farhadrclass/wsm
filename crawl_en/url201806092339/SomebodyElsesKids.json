Her books opened my eyes to the cruel side of the world and brought me outside of my comfort zone. And I just couldn't believe there are others who would shatter kids' hearts and lives, and the reality was just shocking to me. Yet, I was drawn to her story, cried and overjoyed with her and her kids in the story.I had a chance of revisiting her world since a member of my book club chose this book for the next read. I don't remember how many times I cried till I finished the book. My love for the kids grew as Torey's did, and I hope they're now doing fine somewhere in the world."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1414520-shannon", "userReview": "I read \"One Child\" by Hayden and immediately had to have more.

Os livros dela s\u00e3o, para mim, uma verdadeira inspira\u00e7\u00e3o. Admiro o trabalho dela e a forma como ela lida com todas as situa\u00e7\u00f5es. Gostaria muito de falar com ela, trocar ideias e experi\u00eancias... Cada livro que ela nos traz \u00e9 um pequeno peda\u00e7o de um mundo \"anormal\" que tenta viver na \"normalidade\" de um mundo mais alargado. Por\u00e9m, eu questiono sempre: O que \u00e9 ser normal?Eu tenho a minha pr\u00f3pria defini\u00e7\u00e3o e interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de normalidade e, por aquilo que vou lendo nas entrelinhas dos livros da Torey, penso que vou de encontro \u00e0quilo que ele pensa.Em cada livro \u00e9-nos apresentada uma hist\u00f3ria ou um conjuntos de hist\u00f3rias. Tudo depende do n\u00famero de crian\u00e7as que fazem parte do livro. Os filhos do afecto \u00e9 um livro onde Torey nos oferece a hist\u00f3ria de tr\u00eas crian\u00e7as: Lori, Tomaso, Cl\u00e1udia e Boo, Eles constituem uma turma pouco oficial da autora. Cada um tem as suas especificidades e cada um ser\u00e1 protagonista de conquistas, l\u00e1grimas, tristeza e aceita\u00e7\u00e3o. Ainda n\u00e3o consegui encontrar uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o, mas este foi um dos livros da autora que mais me emocionou e tocou. E \u00e9 estranho porque j\u00e1 li livros dela com hist\u00f3rias bem mais fortes e desesperantes do que estas. Achei todas as crian\u00e7as especiais e n\u00e3o consigo destacar uma que me tenha feito vibrar mais do que as outras. No fundo, todas elas significaram alguma coisa para mim. Da Lori, admiro a persist\u00eancia e vontade de fazer diferente. Apesar de toda a for\u00e7a que ela emana e daquele jeito \u00fanico de lidar com os outros, tamb\u00e9m ela tem o seu lado fr\u00e1gil. Foi neste lado mais negro que olhei para ele e senti o qu\u00e3o dif\u00edcil \u00e9 esfor\u00e7armo-nos e, mesmo assim, n\u00e3o atingir aquilo que quer\u00edamos. \u00c9 certo que a Lori tem uma agravante f\u00edsica, provocada por algu\u00e9m que n\u00e3o sabe o que \u00e9 amar uma crian\u00e7a. Tomaso, o rapaz irreverente, refugia-se em mem\u00f3rias e esperan\u00e7as falsas para se ir mantendo \u00e0 tona. Amor d\u00f3i, e ele sabe isso t\u00e3o bem que prefere que as pessoas n\u00e3o gostem dele. Contudo, ao mesmo tempo deixa-se afundar nos bra\u00e7os de Torey, deixa-se amar por ela e por todos os outros meninos e d\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m o seu amor, \u00c9 um rapaz interessante que, com a ajuda psicol\u00f3gica certa, tem um caminho brilhante pela frente.Cl\u00e1udia \u00e9, tal com a Torey, a crian\u00e7a que mais me preocupou ao longo da hist\u00f3ria. Vive no sil\u00eancio e no num mundo muito dela. Tem dificuldade em expressar aquilo que sente e necessidade de receber amor e afeto por parte dos outros. Esta necessidade n\u00e3o me pareceu bem expl\u00edcita. Por\u00e9m, ela vem de uma fam\u00edlia fria e rigorosa e ao primeiro sinal de amor ela segue e faz o que lhe pendem, porque entende que s\u00f3 assim a outra pessoa n\u00e3o deixa de gostar dela.Por fim, temos um Boo, um menino autista que vive num mundo muito dele. \u00c9 complicado conseguir tocar naquele espa\u00e7o onde vive. Mas as ferramentas de Torey e o seu tacto para lidar com as crian\u00e7as e usar o amor no trabalho conseguem algumas leves conquistas. Para ele, n\u00f3s somos o mundo anormal e \u00e9 dif\u00edcil ele encontrar um lugar no nosso mundo onde ele se consiga encaixar. Ele ir\u00e1 conseguir encontrar o seu lugar, mas dentro dele existir\u00e1 um espa\u00e7o que s\u00f3 a ele pertence e n\u00f3s somos t\u00e3o limitados que muito dificilmente l\u00e1 chegaremos. Torey lida com tudo isto de uma forma brilhante. Ao longo do livros s\u00e3o-nos apresentados outros fatores que v\u00e3o condicionando as decis\u00f5es e o estado de esp\u00edrito da autora. Essas pedras no caminho tornam-na numa pessoa mais forte na sua fragilidade. Vale a pena ler o livro. Para quem trabalha com crian\u00e7as \u00e9 um livro inspirador."}, {"userName": "Beverley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652830-beverley", "userReview": "I read this book as a teen many times over and then re-read it as a young adult.

After reading 'Ghost Girl' I found myself eager to read Hayden's other offerings. I actually stumbled across her books quite by chance after I had finished reading all of Cathy Glass & Casey Watson's books & was desperately searching trying to find something similar to fill the empty void they had left in their wake. (So, if you\u2019re a fan of either of these two authors you'll enjoy Torey's books immensely) Each time I've started on one of Torey's books I've got so completely wrapped up in it, that sleep evades me until I've finished the very last page. She has such an ability to draw the reader in.I really connected with the book & each of the children Torey so well describes in it. She does an amazing job at describing the absolute beauty that each of her students possess! The abundance of love, care & affection that Torey dedicates to each & every one of them (whether they deserve it or not) shines so so clearly throughout the pages. No matter how hard some *like Tomaso* try to make themselves repugnant This is a book that will definitely make you cry, but it will also help lift your spirits. I was captivated by Torey's easy style of writing. I shared her & her classes\u2019 anger, frustration & joy throughout the pages. I was so drawn to Torey's odd little class, that after finishing the epilogue I found myself wondering how Boo, Lori, Tomaso & Claudia were all doing nowSo, after a little search (thank god for google), I found Torey's website and subsequently a little catch up on how they're all getting on. (I've added this link just in case anyone's interested)I also\u00a0found this picture of a bluebird\u00a0that Lori drew for Torey in the book"}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1401304-kris", "userReview": "These books are just so emotionally draining. Not because of the kids themselves; their stories are sad, but the way they handle their lives, often with such positivity, is amazing. No, what exhausts me is the fact that there are such horrible people in the world, that would do such horrible things to children. The author, Torey Hayden, is a teacher of special -needs children; in some cases, that means giving extra homework help to a kid struggling with math, but in other cases (as in this book ) it means trying to reach out to a kindergartener with autism, or helping a 10 year old manage severe anger issues, or providing a safe learning space for a pregnant 12 year old. A pregnant. 12 year old. Whose parents refuse to discuss her pregnancy or her post-delivery plans.The majority of my anger and frustration centers around the story of Lori, a young girl who, as a result of child abuse, has suffered brain damage. In most regards she's a typical little girl, but she's physically unable to read; her brain is unable to recognize the different letters and words. She comes to Torey's class for extra help, mainly because her main 1st grade teacher is an idiot who doesn't understand the difference between someone who's being lazy and not trying, and someone who has a physical freaking handicap and cannot freaking do reading, no matter how hard she tries! This idiot teacher makes Lori stand in front of her entire class and read; when she can't read a book, her teacher moves to a lower level book and tries again, gradually moving to ever lower skill levels, the entire time berating Lori for her \"stupidity\" and \"laziness\", until Lori vomits from nerves and runs from the room.While reading this book, I had to constantly remind myself that it was taking place in the 1970s, when special education was a completely different animal. Mainstreaming, or involving special - needs children in the regular classroom as much as possible, was apparently a big thing, and kids who couldn't keep up were (apparently ) out of luck. When I read these books from Karen's list, I try to think how she would have reacted to them. I feel pretty sure that she would have been yelling at the 1st grade teacher and throwing the book in disgust. And crying a little when Tomaso has a breakthrough, or when Boo, the autistic boy, interacts with Torey. I know that's what I was doing."}, {"userName": "Adelina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27702673-adelina", "userReview": "Tositapahtumiin ja oikeisiin henkil\u00f6ihin pohjautuvaa tarinaa on vaikea arvostella.

She tried to help each of those students. There wasn't really anything bad with this book. One of my favorite quotes was \"I had not found resource teaching particularly fulfilling. I had missed the contained-classroom setting. I missed not having my own group of children.

She is very self-congratulatory and though you can tell she cares about her students, she seems a bit arrogant about her own abilities throughout the story. The case studies are varied and interesting in her classroom, but I wish there had been more descriptions and details about their backgrounds and parents than was given by Hayden. Also, because it was written so many decades ago, it was hard to read about how nobody knew how to work with the autistic child, and that the \"regular\" teacher was so awful toward the brain damaged girl.

The odd thing is that I don't think I'd like her books much if they were fiction... too much emotional manipulation, too little resolution, but because they are memoirs they couldn't be any different.That doesn't mean I don't still shake my head at some of Torey's actions and decisions at times though.

The stories are well written and captivate you, but the end result generally fails to deliver because these are true stories. At least this one had a little more of an ending than the previous one I read. I think the scariest sub-story for me in this book was the pregnant twelve-year old. And it wasn't due to sexual abuse, she'd had sex. At 12. That's frightening and scarily is not unheard of these days! So sad ...
