It is a pulpy story, well-written. \"Solid\" is the word that comes to mind, but not mind-bending by any means. If you're looking for a golden age scifi post-apocalyptic book that fills your need for post-atomic mutants and radiation porn, it's adequate to the task.That said, this is one of the earliest examples of post-nuclear holocaust fiction. One can see how other books, movies, and even games dipped deeply into this work. It is seminal.It is also an interesting example of an early attempt at addressing race-relation issues in science fiction. When I caught these undertones, then, later, overt criticisms of the cultural climate, which was contemporary with the work, I was surprised to see that the book was published in 1952. Norton was ahead of her time in this regard. Only the year before did the nascent civil rights movement make news of any appreciable kind. Remember: Brown v. Board of Education didn't get decided until 1954. It's clear from Daybreak 2250 A.D. that Norton was aware of the underground sentiment, the warm coals of dissent that hadn't yet fanned into full flames. I'm not sure how many people would have read the book at that time, but it had to have come as a revelation to some readers back then. A case of fiction as political tool for action."}, {"userName": "Nikki Barnabee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4921832-nikki-barnabee", "userReview": "I read this is 7th grade, then re-read it in high school. I love futuristic, after-the-nuclear-holocaust tales, and who couldn't get into scenes of long-deserted, half-destroyed cities being explored by a boy and his big cat? ;-} Humans are now tribal, hunt with spears, etc., and there are intense battles with nasty, violent creatures who slink through the cities, but my favorite scene was the one in which we see the childlike joy experienced by Fors when he discovers an amazing modern invention -- colored pencils. Enjoyable to read, but sad when you think about all the things our society would be throwing away if a world war went nuclear."}, {"userName": "Checkman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5117003-checkman", "userReview": "The thing about reading so-called \"Golden Age\" science fiction (or at least Silver Age) is you always have to remember that the stories were written in a different time. A time when the world that we now live in was the stuff of science fiction and the world as it existed ,when the writer was creating, influenced him or her. Now at this point you are say, \"No kidding Captain Obvious?\" Yes I know. I hear what you're saying and the sarcasm is very.....obvious. Nevertheless it needs to be stated. Star Man's Son is a post-apocalypse story written by an inexperienced novelist in the early 1950's. It seems to me that Andre Norton was concerned about a couple different things at this time. The first was the Cold War and the terrifying prospect that the United States and the Soviet Union were going to destroy the world with nuclear weapons (the novel was written during the Korean War and just a few years after World War II ended). Once again Captain Obvious arrives at the obvious conclusion.The second was the status of race relations in the United States.The protagonist's comrade in arms is a black man. Not only is he black, but he is a competent and intelligent man who is the equal of our hero. Our hero is a mutant who strikes out on his own when he realizes that his tribe will never truly accept him because he is different. There is war between the tribes and mutants called \"Beast Men\", but also conflict between the different tribes. At the end there is hope that the Humans will come to understand each other and perhaps a new nation will arise from the ruins. In 2014 speak they will \"learn to embrace their diversity\". I've read that in the 1940's and 50's the western genre was used by many writers as a way to cover controversial (social) topics that could not be presented in contemporary dramas. Possibly one of the most famous examples would have to be the Gary Cooper classic High Noon. That movie was a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist witch hunt, but while many got it there were more who didn't. To them it was just a thrilling suspense story set in the old west. I bring that up because I speculate that Norton used the PA setting as a way to address the topic of race. By the early 50's it was apparent to all, but the most obtuse, that changes were coming between black and white in the United States. I think Norton was concerned that if positive action wasn't taken soon those changes would be implemented violently. I see Star Man's Son as both a plea for peace among Humanity as well as a plea for peace and understanding between the different racial groups.This is not a great novel. It's a Freshman effort and it's obvious. At times the plot drags, the action sequences aren't very engrossing, the dialogue is clunky. It reminded me of H.G. Wells with just a faint hint of Victorian/Edwardian science-fiction. One of the good points is that there are no dates, no listing of future events and no \"future\" technology coming into play. This helps to give the novel a type of timelessness that so many other stories set in the \"future\" lack. The story also has sincerity and heart. This isn't a cheap pulp science fiction story. It never appeared in a magazine as a serial, but was a full novel from the get go. Norton wrote a novel in which she was trying to make a difference. It was just camouflaged as a science fiction/post-apocalypse adventure novel. For that I give the book three stars. It's a good honest (Freshman) effort and there is nothing wrong with that."}, {"userName": "Louis Shalako", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4009821-louis-shalako", "userReview": "One of the few science fiction books around the house when I was younger. Probably the one book that hooked me on SF. Andre Norton is better known for more recent fantasy, and her rocket and ray guns books of the fifties and sixties, but this one is apocalyptic SF. It had a big influence on me, as you can imagine. Other of her works were a little disappointing, after re-reading them three decades later. I would like to read this one again. If the only Andre Norton book you have ever read was 'Return to Quag Keep,' then check this one out.

Until I came to goodreads, I had been rebuffed in my search for the title because I could not remember if it was 2025 or not. By digging, Andre Norton's name came up, and I remembered. This was one of the books that really made me think about the aftermath of our egos, nuclear war, and survivors."}, {"userName": "Bree Brouwer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7600975-bree-brouwer", "userReview": "Norton's writing is a solid example of a traditional, classic novel from the Golden Age of science fiction, with somewhat lofty and descriptive overtones, but modern readers used to more decisive plots and immediate action will most likely find it difficult to get through.The story is written in much of an epic styles, where the hero Fors risks becoming an outlaw so he can make a name for himself to prove he belongs in his clan despite his mutant genes. He goes from one place to another, seeing new sites (that Norton does a very good of describing and creating an image in the reader's mind), all the while searching for something he can bring back to his clan. However, I found myself searching for a reason why there had to be so MUCH explanation of Fors travels, as the first several chapters are just him exploring, thinking, and hoping.When Fors finally meets another humankind to travel with, we get more of the same \"then this happened, then this, then this\" style of writing. It did drag my reading and stretched out what should have been an easy read of a week into several. I cared for the characters, but not at the expense of constant reading with no reward. I knew the entire point of the book was to explain how Fors did or did not become accepted, but despite this being discussed on occasion in the traveling passages, I do not feel like the book's underlying structure kept this thread running strongly enough to justify my 100% concern for Fors' situation.However, for me the reward finally came in the last 1/3 of the book, where Fors and his companion Arskane meet several different groups of humans and participate in a plan to guide them towards war with the Beast Things instead of with each other. This situation seemed far more important to me than the previous part of the book, as the writing here is descriptive yet not drawn out or unnecessary. I suddenly saw why Fors had to be in that location, and why he had met all these new people. I just wish those reasons had come a little sooner than 2/3 of the way in.On a side note, I found it humorous in some spots of the book to read what was obviously a woman's interpretation (as Andre Norton was a pseudonym for Mary Alice Norton) of weaponry or survival. For example, at one point Fors is lamenting the fact that he doesn't have his traditional, large bow and arrows with him, but he has a sword and notes that most swords are all the same anyway. I am positive blacksmiths of old and modern day would not agree with this, as would most men or women who have used different types of swords. I am not sure Norton intended to have this interpretation to show Fors' lack of understanding of swordsmanship or if Norton herself simply didn't understand it. Either way, it was something of a game to me to find instances where her femininity was betrayed by her writing.Overall, Daybreak 2250 A.D. was a good read and probably one that science fiction fans should consider; it did get many raving reviews during its time, so it's not something that should be ignored. However, should anyone want to read this book, prepare for a slow start and then a speedy wrap-up and explanation of everything towards the end. The post-apocalyptic world Norton created was very interesting to read about, but not for an entire 120 out of 190 pages' worth."}, {"userName": "Orlando Falvo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3511738-orlando-falvo", "userReview": "The first book I ever purchased and read, cover to cover.A real accomplishment for a 2nd grader in the 60's.

No attempt is made to negotiate with the 'Beast Things', and the same behavior that's accepted (with reservations) in humans (and even lizard people) is regarded as making the Beast Things 'not human' and candidates for extermination. The only real difference, so far as I can see, is that the Beast Things don't smell good to others--a common basis for mass murder in Norton's books. Even if a peacemaker had arisen among the 'Beast Things' (instead of a war leader), it seems unlikely that their overtures would be accepted--a sort of 'the only good Beast Thing is a dead Beast Thing' attitude, thinly disguised by arguing that the mutations have made the Beast Things 'born criminals' (ala Lombroso), and so unreachable.Peace among humans, when sought, is negotiated by the women, except (from what I can tell) in the Eyrie, where no women appear--though there must be some, since there are children. The cover of the edition I have (which says, btw, that it's a 1952 edition) has an inaccurate picture of Lura.
