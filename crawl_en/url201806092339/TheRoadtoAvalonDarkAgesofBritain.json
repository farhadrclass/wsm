It was wonderful to start with the young Arthur and the experiences that made him the man - king -- that he was. The love story between Arthur and Morgan is truly heartbreaking and will bring tears to your eyes. The scene where Arthur comes face to face with the son he didn't know he had is gut wrenching. I highly recommend this book, as well as the other two that follow in this trilogy, Born of the Sun and The Edge of Light. I wish the author would return to this style and quality of writing as opposed to the light fluffy regencies she is currently writing."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4586789-dana", "userReview": "I'm obsessed with Arthurian legend. I can't find an arthurian legend book without wanting to pick it up. Morgana le fay, Arthur, Merlin, Guinevere, Nimueh, Lancelot\u2026. any of these character's names shows up and I have to get the book. It's rather unhealthy.I read this book a long time ago, but just had to read it again. My favorite relationship of the legend is that between Arthur and Morgana, but unfortunately most stories only focus on the hate and loathing, while I see them as the most tragic love story. The Road to Avalon is the only version of the arthurian legend i have found that focuses on the pure and good love between Arthur and Morgana. I wish the story had given Morgana more of a dark undertone, but that wasn't what Joan Wolf was going for. THe strongest part of this entire story has to be the depth to Arthur, who really is the main narrator of the story. Often Arthur is pushed in the back of his own legend, but in this version he is the center. While there were some things that bothered me (Guinevere at the end, and Mordred himself) overall I loved the retelling and how she focused on Arthur's first love. Definitely recommend reading it!"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1735050-kim", "userReview": "[There are so many renditions of the legends, most of them focusing on the tragic love of Gwenhwyfar and Bedwyr (Lancelot's older, traditional name), or some of the other characters of the stories. Wolf, however, returns to the center of all the legends, to the man who gave these legends his name -- Arthur. A charismatic, brilliant man who gave early medieval Britain a generation of glory and light that would be sung about and retold down through the ages.Wolf's treatment of the characters was particularly genius. Practically all but one of the characters are portrayed as essentially good people, flawed but not malicious. Only Agravaine, one of the traditional villains of the legends, retains his malicious and vicious nature. Arthur is a great man and king who yet pines for the woman he loves most in the world and yet can never completely have. Gwenhwyfar is a good woman instead of the flighty fool who truly loves two men and still makes mistakes. Morgan is a healer and physician, independent and dutiful, giving up her own happiness for the sake of the country that she loves. Then there is Mordred, who is perhaps the most tragic of all, a boy whose only fault is being easily manipulated by a brother he loved, a boy who unwillingly brings destruction upon everything he touches.I particularly enjoyed the romance of Arthur and Morgan, a love that lasted a lifetime and never got a chance to have the light of the world shine upon it. It was Morgan who had to be the stronger of the two, to give up what they both so dearly wanted so that Arthur could fulfill the role he was born for, especially when Arthur was all for giving it up and running away with her. Yet, despite their separation, their love still survives, and they manage to find one another again.One almost pities Gwenhyfar, desperately wanting the love of her husband and yet taking years to finally understand that Arthur's heart was already taken long before she married him. It was a relief when she at last found peace and happiness with Bedwyr, a man who is much easier for her to understand and connect with and love.An absolutely amazing story. I couldn't get enough of it. Wolf wove the legends together into a single narrative, bringing several different events and guiding them all to fit together as one story. Utterly genius.

I thought perhaps this was aimed at younger readers but it doesn't appear to be. Shame, I think that demographic would actually embrace this simplistic, utopian version.

I am guessing somewhere around 1988. It is one of my all time favorites. This book sucked me in. At the time I really wasn't much of a reader but I got the \"itch\" to read one day and took the time to hang out in the library long enough to find this one. I literally walked up and down the isles just looking at titles and covers waiting for something to call out to me. When I came across this one I decided it looked interesting enough to give it a try. Surprisingly, I couldn't put it down. I found a genre I loved. It's a mix of historical happenings (maybe not so true), romance and telepathy. It takes you all the way through the lives of the characters so you are given plenty of time to learn to love or hate them. I remember balling my eyes out in the end. I couldn't believe it ended.

After an abusive childhood, Arthur is rescued by his grandfather, Merlin, and brought back to Avalon. There, he falls in love with Merlin's daughter Morgan and their relationship influences everything else that transpires - his kingship, his marriage, and his death. From that small synopsis, it's apparent how Joan Wolf has played with the standard Arthurian myth and reconfigured some of the key relationships. It's an interesting and different way to tell the story and for the most part, it's largely successful. It's well-written and entertaining, and it has a brisk pace that covers Arthur's entire life in about 350 pages. The historical setting was well-done, combining Roman and Celtic influences. I especially enjoyed the kingliness of Arthur. Often I've found he's reduced to playing the cuckolded husband, but here he is an intelligent, strong leader. You understand why he is the high king and why people are so devoted to him. However, my main issue with this book also had to do with Arthur. His relationship with Morgan is the center of the story, so much so that everything else gets pushed aside and short-changed. As I said, it's not a long book so everything that isn't Morgan gets a brief treatment. Guinevere in particular felt rushed and underdeveloped - Arthur treats her horribly and her relationship with Lancelot is so hastily developed that I never quite believed in it. Likewise, little time is spent on Camelot, the Knights of the Round Table, the battles, and many characters that often feature prominently, such as Merlin. It felt more like a romance novel than your traditional King Arthur story. If you are into romance novels, you may love this. For me, the whole story was so heavily focused on the author's pet project - Arthur and Morgan's relationship - that everything else that I love about the King Arthur story was neglected. This is especially apparent at the end of the book, which concludes abruptly without resolution for the majority of the characters.This is by no means a painful read and it's always interesting to read a different take on the Arthurian legend. But it was so sidetracked by the Arthur and Morgan relationship that everything else becomes unimportant and the epic story of King Arthur is greatly reduced."}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4794002-natasha", "userReview": "Any fan of fantasy or of historical drama has read or watched at least two versions of the Arthurian legend. While all take on a slightly different telling, this one by far is the most unique I've read and also the best I've read.And no, that's not because it support my Arthur/Morgan love.Focused on a Britain left to its own devices after the Roman Empire pulls out in the early dark ages, Merlin, a former Roman General learns from his daughter, Igraine, that her husband Uther is dying. The frustrating thing is that they have no legitimate children. So Igraine sends her father, Merlin, to Wales to get their son, Arthur, who was sent away shortly after he was born because of the severe question of his legitimacy. Uther isn't dead yet and it's time that Arthur learned the ways to be king.Abused and alone in Wales, Arthur is found by his grandfather, whom he is told is a rich benefactor and goes to live with the old man at his villa, Avalon, home to exceptional apple orchards where Merlin lives with his young daughter, Morgan.Yes, you have read this right. Merlin is the father of Igraine and Morgan. He also has another daughter, Morgause, whose married to King Lot in the north.It's at Avalon that Arthur grows up, this slight, dark haired, fierce boy who shall be king and it's there that he falls in love with quiet and strong Morgan, unknowing that they're half related.Gwen is actually tolerable, even likeable in this telling. Her and Arthur and Bedwyr (Lancelot) are best friends and oh man, the love story between Arthur and Morgan. It's so unwavering and hard and lovely and just rips at you inside and leaves you a weeping mess, turning every page hoping that this ending will be different against all the others.It's an easy ready, an addicting, satisfying read for any Arthurian lover. If you like, say, the movie Tristan and Isolde, or Dark Age Britain that doesn't forget that they were, at one time, under Roman influence, pick this up."}, {"userName": "Vivisection", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1317092-vivisection", "userReview": "This is not the smutty historical I usually prefer.

As far as Arthurian Legend goes it feels a bit inaccurate but none-the-less it's still a brilliant adaption and I loved the Arthur/Morgan focus of it.However! I will admit I found parts of it boring and far too lengthy. So many things had long winded descriptions that really didn't need it whereas other parts that perhaps needed a bit more description were short and not very clear.I really liked how Morgan and Arthur were portrayed in this book though, it felt pretty true to what I already knew and had read about the legend. I didn't like, early in the book, when Arthur was going to drown himself in the lake to make Morgan feel bad. That didn't seem like something Arthur would do, in any version of the legend.I very much enjoyed the last bit, despite how much it made me cry; She had felt despair when first they carried him in, but it was gone now. He was still and white and blood had stained through the bandages and she knew he was dying. She could not call him back this time. But he was at peace. She could feel that in him, and she was glad. He had been going away and he had made one last great effort to come back, but now because he was fighting it. He had come back to share some of that peace with them, and to say good-bye. She crossed to the bed and his heavy lids lifted. Lie with me, he said. He was beyond pain, and so she did as he asked, resting her head against his arm. We will be together, he told her. Believe that. This is only for a little while. We were always meant to be together, you and I. She did believe him, and some of his peace crept into her own heart. Arthur, she said. Arthur, my love. She felt his head move, and his thought came through, faint but clear, Your hair always smells like lavender.Overall a brilliant read and I'm glad I finally got around to reading it!"}, {"userName": "Arthurianmaiden", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5605520-arthurianmaiden", "userReview": "I've read a lot of novels about arthurian legend but this one is very different from all the others. All the characters seem new characters but not in a bad sense. Maybe the only bad thing about this novel is that it is not written by one point of view and the feeling I had was that it was a bit confusing while passing throught different narrators even in the same page. Still, the book is amazing. Morgause and Morgana are completely rewritten from the 'tradition' of other arthurian novels I've read. As Guinevere is and all these female characters gain new perspective and grey shades.Even the love stories (Morgana and Arthur, Guinevere and Bedivere) are very sweet but the best thing is the character of Arthur who is, without any doubt, the best written one and the one I liked less (bur for personal reasons!). He is cold, hurt and at the same time loyal and very human. All the non protagonist characters have sensible explanations for their actions, especially the two villains Agravaine and Mordred. It is very satisfying for me to read a book where the villains have actually reasons. My personal preferences always go to Mordred and this book did not disappoint me in re-writing him: he is kind, naive and weak. A lot of arthurian books, especially the ones with a sympathetic Mordred, write him as a natural leader and a good heir for Arthur's throne. In this one instead Mordred is no leader and he would be an awful king because he is easily manipulated. To end this rant, I can say that this book, a part from the amazing plot, let me re-read this characters and watch them in a new light."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5268938-lauren", "userReview": "I've never really been a big fan of Arthuriana, the \"Matter of Britain.\" I have always preferred the humble realism and megalomaniacal narcissism of the real kings of medieval Britain and France, like Henry II and his devil's brood. Joan Wolf brings to life these fantastic characters in a way that feels real. I always hated the way other treatments of this legend emasculated Arthur, supposedly the greatest king ever, and made him a fool for a beautiful flighty inconstant hussy who cheated on him with the first pretty boy who could handle a sword. Wolf gives him his balls back, and the characters in this telling of the legend read and feel like real people, flawed, feeling, all-too-human REAL. I love a shrewd (and beautiful) Gwenhwyfar, a self-sacrificing yet all too selfish Morgan, a mortal Merlin, an Arthur who isn't a doddering old fool.

'The Road to Avalon' however I enjoyed very much.I enjoyed the story, the characters and their relationships. The story is somewhat simple but very emotional with complicated relationships of forbidden and unrequited love, betrayal, deception, jealousy and deep admiration.I enjoyed the description of the landscape, the architecture and the horsemanship, which reminded me of seeing the Lipizzaner Stallions perform. I really liked the complexities that Wolf ascribes to these characters.I enjoyed the love story between Arthur and Morgan and while there was a thread of fantasy woven through their relationship that I would have liked better without I still enjoyed their story very much.I thought the contemporary dialogue gave the story a less authentic feel but it also makes this novel much more assessable for a greater audience.

It came to me highly recommended, particularly because of the romance between Arthur and Morgan, however I found it hard to feel passionate about any of the characters or plot lines. The majority of characters are nice people. They start out nice and they finish nice; there is very little character progression at all. All of the expected elements of Arthurian legend are there, they just seem to lack substance.I found the parts while they were children growing up to be the most interesting, but after Arthur became King I felt the story became a little stale and repetitive. There was none of the epic grandeur that I enjoy about Arthurian legend and I feel this is because the focus of the story was on the romance, which failed to engage me.I would recommend it for pre-teens or anyone who hadn't read very much Arthurian legend.

In fact, I might say it's one of my favorites. This year I've been reading a lot of books having to do with Arthurian Legend. What makes this book stand out to me is how every single character is made out to be sympathetic, good, but with flaws that eventually lead to their downfalls. There is no one purely evil character. Gwenhwfer, Mordred, Morgan, they're all likable. Arthur/Morgan have this beautiful relationship too, one of the best portrayed. Another thing that made the book stand out to me was the fact that there wasn't much religious debate, something that made Mists of Avalon not as enjoyable to me.

I typically love all things Arthurian but as soon as this book took off into the land of mind reading and telepathic links I couldn't roll my eyes harder. Road to Avalon is a romantic historical fiction focusing on a pleasant love affair between King Arthur and Morgan (who we know as the evil Morgan le Fey). Of course, many of the character tropes that legend has attributed to the standard characters were lost in this retelling, with it being similar to the King Arthur movie of the 2000s (see: Clive Owen and Kiera Knightly and Romans). Thus I found the latter half of the book incredibly boring. Honestly the back of the book's description was more exciting.

Bringing together so many groups at odds with each other though out England is no easy task and would take a life time to accomplish. Although Arthur loves one woman, he loves another but she knowing he was born for England refuses his love. He resolutely sets himself to the task of uniting England.

Never before has a telling of the Arthur story made the breathtaking drama of this charismatic king more real or moving.", "title": "The Road to Avalon\n      \n          (Dark Ages of Britain #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/692969.The_Road_to_Avalon", "average": 4.01, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388720115l/692969.jpg", "reviews": 106, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/67276.Joan_Wolf", "name": "Joan Wolf"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33876.Mary_Jo_Putney", "name": "Mary Jo Putney"}], "type": ["Historical", "Mythology", "Fantasy", "Romance", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/692969.The_Road_to_Avalon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1777572.The_Road_to_Avalon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6834891-the-road-to-avalon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26858585-the-road-to-avalon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2076520.The_Road_to_Avalon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9651564-a-reluctant-queen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/858171.Daughter_of_the_Red_Deer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/958497.His_Lordship_s_Mistress", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/958475.The_Reindeer_Hunters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/889613.Golden_Girl"]}
