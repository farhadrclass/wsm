I love her books because she also brings her characters to life, making them people you care about and relate to. My love of historical fiction also draws me to her books. \"Whiter than Snow\" is set in the historical town of Swandyke, located at a high elevation just west of the Continental Divide. The book begins with a massive avalanche in this mining town where the land has been cleared by hydraulic mining. So we know from the beginning that this disaster occurs just as school has dismissed, and likely some children are caught in the snow. But then Dallas tells the stories of various people who are from different backgrounds and locations, but all end up in Swandyke at this momentous time. The disaster brings the towns people together and proves to break down some social barriers. Though we know there is loss of life, it still is a story of forgiveness and acceptance that makes improvement in some people's lives."}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/991781-toni", "userReview": "Sandra Dallas' books are pure enjoyment for me.

I read this book in a 24 hour time span - it was engrossing and a quick easy read. And I don't quite know what I expected, since I just picked up the book based on the fact that it was a new one from Sandra Dallas - I think I've read pretty much everything she's written. But somehow this didn't meet those expectations, whatever they were.I'm not big on short story collections, and this sort of felt like that to me. Even though I figured once I got into it a bit that she was going to tie everything together, it still felt a bit choppy to me. And each person's \"back story\" had so many characters that I had to mentally keep them sorted in order to keep track of them all.By the time I got to where Mrs. Dallas was wrapping things up, it almost felt rushed. (You know, like in one of those movies that are going along at a nice pace and suddenly it is as if they thought, \"My gosh, we're into this thing 115 minutes, we better finish quick so we're at the usual 2 hour time span.\")I didn't quite sense the \"redemption\" thing that others have described. Just a bunch of people with tragic backgrounds, in a tragic situation with tragic consequences that deal with it the best they could. That's not an unusual story, and I didn't find the telling of it particularly extraordinary. However, I am glad that I spent the time and read it. Just didn't think it measured up to some of the author's previous works.A favorite passage:\"I never was arrested, and I never was a juror. I never rode in an automobile, and I have one tooth left. You think I'll go to heaven?\""}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177641-staci", "userReview": "I have yet to read a Dallas book that I wasn't totally absorbed into from the very first sentence. She has a way of putting the reader right there in the moment of tragedy. I felt the coldness of the snow. The desperation of the parents. The joy when a loved one was recovered. The anguish when a small child who would not draw another breath was laid to rest. The author does an amazing job of taking you into the lives of each family affected and traces the choices they made that brought them all to Swandyke, Colorado. There are so many different themes explored in this story: redemption, betrayal, forgiveness, racism, and love. It makes you think twice about fate and how nothing is really left to chance and that everything....everything has a reason and purpose.

An avalanche, taking everything in its path, including nine children on their way home from school, hurtles down a slope. Their are the Patch sisters, Lucy and Dolly, who between them have five children buried under all the snow. Lucy and Dolly have not spoken in many years, not since Dolly betrayed Lucy in the most horrible way. Wanting to get out of the town, Lucy goes to College, with the stipulation that she will return to Swandyke after she graduates to work. Her income going to her family to help support them. She agrees so that Dolly may have a better life. But just when Lucy finds true happiness, Dolly pulls the rug out from under her. Joe Cobb is the only black man in Swandyke. Years ago, when his wife Orange was in labor with their second child, things were not going very well and Joe ran to the white doctor for help to save his wife. The doctor made Joe stand at the screen door while he finished his supper, drank his coffee and smoked his after-dinner cigar. Then he followed Joe to his wife, but it was too late. Orange had died in that time. Angry and bereaved, Joe hit the doctor. Knowing it for a hanging offense, Joe grabbed his young daughter Jane and ran. He ended up in the small town of Swandyke and has had a few enjoyable years, until his daughter is one of those buried in the snow. Minder Evans is an elderly Civil War Veteran who spends his days cleaning and tidying up the cemetery. Minder hasn't had any peace in his life since his cowardice cost the life of his partner in the service. The true light in his life is his grandson Emmett, who he is raising. But when he finds out that Emmett is also buried in the avalanche, Minder believes God is punishing him for his cowardice years ago. Essie Snowball is a prostitute in the small town of Swandyke. Not wanting to bring shame upon her daughter, she has her stay with a friend, and watches her from afar except dinner on Sundays. She never planned to fall into the life, as she always dreamed of being a dressmaker, but a shady romance turned south, it was the best way for her to make fast cash. Now, with her daughter under the snow, it might have been for naught. Grace Foote is the Mining Managers wife. Grace grew up with money and went to finishing school. She fell in love, but he wouldn't marry her since her family just lost their wealth. She seduces Jim, and finding herself pregnant, they marry. But Grace has never fit in with the townsfolk, and has always put on airs. Now with her son buried in the avalanche, Grace will need to put her fancy ways behind her. As the men dig for the children, the townsfolk all come together. Black, white, prostitute, or elderly, when there is a tragedy, all personal beliefs are set aside. As the women huddle together frantic for their children, they set aside old differences and realize that it didn't really matter in the big pictures, did it? And perhaps they will find peace, and forgiveness, and maybe hope. WHITE THAN SNOW hooked me from the first page. I was entranced in the lives of the characters and devastated with the tragedy of the children. Some lived, some didn't, but you will find yourself praying they all do and your heart breaking when they don't. The lives of the townsfolk intertwine in a rich woven tapestry, and Ms Dallas unravels the pieces gently but firmly. I highly recommend Whiter Than Snow - one of the best books I've read this year!"}, {"userName": "Hillary Woody", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213936-hillary-woody", "userReview": "It\u2019s hard to describe just how unfortunately not good this book is. \u201cUnfortunately\u201d because you would expect more from a New York Times best-selling author. And given the genuine praise Sandra Dallas\u2019s other novels received for her ability to write historical fiction and her \u201cterrific\u201d (according to Publisher\u2019s Weekly) characters, you would expect Whiter Than Snow to stand out in the same ways. On the contrary, these are the elements which failed this time around.The story begins with a devastating avalanche in the small mountain town of Swandyke, CO. After spending the first chapter going into some detail about the avalanche, Dallas spends the next five chapters giving back story on each of the parents of the children trapped in the avalanche. \u201cBack story\u201d may or may not be a fair term given that there is little more to the story than these chapters. However these \u201cback stories\u201d describe how each of the characters ended up in Swandyke and how they came to have the conflicts that they have. More entertaining stories keep the back story to a minimum and focus instead on how the character resolves their conflict. And while Dallas\u2019s method could work, it doesn\u2019t, as she spends as much time telling the reader as showing him or her what happened before. The remaining two chapters tell what happen after the earthquake hit.Dallas\u2019s characters come across as clich\u00e9d and boring. There are three women, two of which are ahead of their time (as the novel is set in the early 1900\u2019s) and desperately want to go to college against the wishes of their parents. The rest of the stories seem stereotypical as well. Imagine a black man, a civil war veteran, and a hooker at the turn of the last century and you will have pretty much nailed the remaining three characters\u2019 back stories.Not everything about Whiter Than Snow is bad. It has a good message about forgiveness and the idea that life will go on. Still, the novel could have been more impactful had Dallas really let us get to know the characters through dialogue and scene and spent more time in the \u201cafter\u201d the avalanche than the \u201cbefore.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Nicola Mansfield", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1682713-nicola-mansfield", "userReview": "Reason for Reading: I've always wanted to read a Sandra Dallas book and the plot of this one was particularly intriguing.This is a beautiful story. It's what I call a light read. I picked the book up one evening and when it was time to turn out the light saw I had read three-quarters of the book. The story is simple and quite straight-forward but Dallas has written it in such a manner that the reader becomes emotionally involved in the characters by the time the already mentioned tragedy unfolds. She brings to her characters redemption, love, forgiveness and perhaps a look into God's mysterious way.The story opens with an avalanche on top of a mountain in a tiny mining village and nine children coming home from school are caught in the slide. We are told four survived. Then each of the following chapters focuses on a child's or siblings' parents or in some cases parent. These historical vignettes can go as far back as the grandparents but most concentrate on the parent(s) and the one great or many small sins they have hidden in their lives. Each ends with the birth of the children or sometime in their early life. So we never really get to know the children, only through how they are thought of by others. Then comes a point when the story picks up with the avalanche and we watch the town come together to deal with the rescue and tragedy that is their fate.The reader is in a position now to know how each family will react if it is their child(ren) that die and the reader is also vested in who could best handle the situation and perhaps who most needs redemption through the experience of death. Each person with a buried child has a reason to think they are being punished for their past sins and each also has reason to be forgiven. How it works out for the families in the end is very satisfying both for those who lost their children and those whose children lived. A beautiful story and a page-turner. I will certainly be adding Sandra Dallas to my list of authors to read."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3155905-anne", "userReview": "Sandra Dallas is a solid story-teller whose books often recreate early 20th century Midwestern and Western history. In \"Whiter than Snow\", the story of an avalanche in a dirt-poor gold-mining town in Colorado that kills or injures 9 schoolchildren, the author traces the life of each parent leading up to the moment when the snow rumbles down the mountain into the path as their child walks home from school that day. Like Wilder's \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\", fate brings together formerly unconnected people when disaster strikes and as in that book the lives of the people are traced backward from that event. Unlike \"the Bridge of San Luis Ray\" where a priest witnesses a bridge falling and tries to figure out the connection among the victims and God's intent, Dallas' book does not consider the meaning of fate or God's intent. Most of the residents of the bleak town of Swandyke, Colorado have long since lost faith in God or at least stopped trying to find the meaning in the mining accidents, weather disasters, illness, poverty and wars that they have experienced. They just soldier on and find comfort in the community of the mutually bereaved and afflicted. Sounds like a grim story, but the books is suspenseful, well-plotted and ultimately hopeful, as are all of this author's books."}, {"userName": "Diane Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9796451-diane-lynn", "userReview": "4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Debbie Maskus", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2486098-debbie-maskus", "userReview": "I have read two other of Sandra Dallas's books, and I enjoyed this as much as Tallgrass. I found Prayers For Sale to be a little slow. Whiter Than Snow is set in a mining town, as is Prayers For Sale. An avalanche falls in April 1920, in a small mining town in Colorado and buries nine young school children. The story begins with the avalanche and then quickly turns to describe the life of each parent or caregiver of the nine children. In the various stories are two sisters who have not spoken to one another in years, a Jewish prostitute saving money to open a dress making shop, an old Civil War veteran fighting with guilt, the mine manager and his wife, and the only Negro in the town-a single black man with a 6 year old daughter.

Dallas weaves a tale set in the 1920's in Swandyke, Colorado, a small mining town where an avalanche sweeps away nine young children as they walk home from school. Only four survive. The story goes back to share the stories of the lives of the parents of these children, of their differences in family, culture, social status and religion. Dallas puts you in the midst of the hardships, heartbreaks, family trials, the challenges faced in a small mining town and the emotional damages from the wages of war. After the avalanche, this bittersweet story tells of how people join together to help one another during a tragedy forgetting their differences and changing how they view and treat one another. Whiter Than Snow is a story of love, loss, forgiveness, family, redemption and God's grace.This book reminded me of how neighbor and stranger alike always came together when we experienced hurricanes on the Gulf Coast of MS with everyone only looking to help one another rebuild lives."}, {"userName": "Virginia Myers", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9114567-virginia-myers", "userReview": "Someone else said this book was \u201csoul satisfying\u201d. I agree, it is just that. It makes me feel good to know that people who have been somehow bruised by life can come together and either ignore that bruise or determine to forget it when tragedy strikes a community.The book tells the story of how several people who now live in a small Colorado mining community pull together to console each other or to assist in recovery efforts when a group of children are swept away by a dreadful avalanche. The 1st Chapter sets the stage for the community\u2019s actions, the next 5 Chapters tell the story of the \u201cbruised\u201d people, and the last two Chapters wrap up the outcome for the people involved. I felt the middle 5 Chapters did allow the readers to live within the skins of the people involved \u2013 and that is a plus.

Just moments after four o\u2019clock, a large split of snow separates from Jubilee Mountain high above the tiny hamlet and hurtles down the rocky slope, enveloping everything in its path including nine young children who are walking home from school. But only four children survive. Whiter Than Snow takes you into the lives of each of these families: There\u2019s Lucy and Dolly Patch\u2014two sisters, long estranged by a shocking betrayal. Joe Cobb, Swandyke\u2019s only black resident, whose love for his daughter Jane forces him to flee Alabama. There\u2019s Grace Foote, who hides secrets and scandal that belies her genteel fa\u00e7ade. And Minder Evans, a civil war veteran who considers his cowardice his greatest sin. Finally, there\u2019s Essie Snowball, born Esther Schnable to conservative Jewish parents, but who now works as a prostitute and hides her child\u2019s parentage from all the world.
