I love finding original, diamonds like this cuz it makes my brain go...\nAs other astute people have chimed, this story turned out to be much deeper and a lot different than I originally expected (in a yippie, yippie good way). This book was such an enjoyable experience and made me want get a serious preach on sermonizing its greatness. While containing elements of science fiction, fantasy and horror, I don\u2019t think the novel neatly fits into any of those containers and spills uniqueness over the cup of any genre that tries to hold it. I'm gonna just wimp out and label it speculative fiction and move on because I am not the person to decide the proper name of new genre bending categories. However, that doesn't mean I'm not willing to throw on my Leopard mankini and Tarzan out singing the praises of this story. Oh, I will. You, just watch me. The story takes the unique approach of combining the scientific/biological study of mental illness with demonic possession and creating a combined phenomenon that is very compelling. The blending of these two components was worth three \"Fuck Yeahs\" and a \"You go Boy\" all by itself. BACKGROUNDThe story takes place in an alternate version of the United States where, beginning around the 1940\u2019s, demonic possession has become a recognized and accepted phenomenon. However, the demonic possession in the story is quite different from our common perception of possession. Here, each \u201cdemon\u201d has a particular trait/compulsion that they exhibit every time they appear. There is the \u201cPainter\u201d who appears at the very beginning of the story and shuts down an airport terminal while it creates a picture of a farmhouse out of smashed popcorn. Other identified demons include \u201cCaptain,\u201d \u201cSmokestack Johnny,\u201d \u201cThe Truth,\u201d \u201cLittle Angel,\u201d \u201cKamikaze\u201d and \u201cHellion.\u201d I will leave it to you to learn what each of the demons signature actions are because that is part of the enjoyment of the story. Anyway, most possessions last a very short time (minutes to hours) and the interruptions caused by the incidents have basically become a part of life (like the Painter scene described above). Possessions occur much more often in people that have previously suffered some form of mental illness. In addition, once subject to a possession, victims often suffer after effects very similar to various forms of mental illness, even if not previously diagnosed with such a condition. This tie-in between possession and mental illness was delicious and gave the story an added depth and richness that was very compelling. For instance, just look at the similarities between these two real life examples:...\n ...PLOT SUMMARYI think the above gives a pretty good idea about the background of the story and I want to make sure I don\u2019t spoil any of the fun of the book. Therefore, as far as the plot, I will just say that the main character, Del Pierce, was possessed by the demon known as the Hellion when he was a wee lad. Years later, Del is still struggling with the after effects of the possession and desperately wants to find away to get rid of his symptoms. The rest of the story is Del\u2019s incredible journey to find a way to cure himself. There are so many great pop culture references and tie-ins during the story that I went completely Chumbawamba while I was reading it. I don't want to spill the franks or the beans about them because they are such funsies to casually bump into so I will just say that they include super heroes, science fiction writers, secret societies, folklore monsters, an alternate \u201cend\u201d to the OJ trial and a Vast Active Living Intelligence System (okay so I spoiled that one but it's in the book description so you can\u2019t blame me). FINAL THOUGHTSOverall, a very unique and original reading experience. I thought the writing was great and the author\u2019s use of tone was excellent. It was often full of humor and yet also had an underlying sense of deep loneliness and sadness. It is tough to walk that fine line and I think the author did a great job.

If you want a review with links, see my blog at: http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2014/1...Pandemonium reminds me of those times when my foodie friends are dragging me to a \u201cfabulous new restaurant\u201d where (mostly) familiar ingredients are deconstructed, spiced and recombined in a creative way. At least this time, instead of an unsettling mess, it resulted in one of those perfect, satisfying meals that fulfill a sensory need as much as a physical one. Not so unusual that I\u2019m left with a disturbing aftertaste, and not so routine that it is immediately forgettable. To wit:Salvatore\u2019s award-winning pizza with wine-poached fig (yes, you read that right), bacon and gorgonzola. Unusual but delicious take on pizza. http://salvatorestomatopies.com/2012/...Pandemonium is a lot like that. Somewhat familiar elements drawn from comic books, buddy flicks and mythology are blended together in a plot that moves quickly but respects each ingredient. Add in some complex characterization, dashes of dark humor and develop it with truly fine writing, and I\u2019m served a book that satisfying on both intellectual and emotional levels.The simple summary: Del is returning to his mother\u2019s home with a dual purpose: confess a recent car accident and psychiatric hospitalization, and to meet a famous demonology researcher at a national conference. Demons are real, although their manifestations usually pass quickly, while the behavior follows certain archetypes: The Painter, the Little Angel, Truth: \u201cThe news tracked them by name, like hurricanes. Most people went their whole lives without seeing one in person. I\u2019ve seen five\u2013six, counting today\u2019s.\u201d When Del was young, he was possessed by the Hellion, a wild boy entity, and Del has recently developed suspicions that the Hellion never left him. The story follows Del as he attempts to understand and perhaps free the entity inside him.The plot moved nicely with enough balance between introspection and action to keep me interested. What I loved the most, however, was the writing. There\u2019s the vivid imagery:A small white-haired women glared up at me, mouth agape. She was seventy, seventy-five years old, a small bony face on a striated, skinny neck: bright eyes, sharp nose, and skin intricately webbed from too much sun or wind or cigarettes. She looked like one of those orphaned baby condors that has to be fed by puppets\u201dthe humor:\u201cThe question, then, was how long could a human being stay awake? Keith Richards could party for three days straight, but I wasn\u2019t sure if he counted as a human being\u201cand sheer cleverness (because I\u2019ve been this lost driving in Canada):\u201cFor the past few hours we\u2019d been twisting and bobbing along two-lane back roads, rollercoastering through pitch-black forests. And now we were lost. Or rather, the world was lost. The GPS told us exactly where we were but had no idea where anything else was.Permanent Global Position: You Are Here.\u201dand the occasional snarky social commentary:\"What did it matter? I imagined bearded guys all over academia working themselves into a lather over this, precisely because the stakes were so low.\"For those who might want a sense of the flavor, I was reminded of American Gods, of George R.R. Martin\u2019s Wild Card world (my review) blended with Mythago Wood (my review), but done much, much better. While I had problems maintaining interest in each of the aforementioned, I had no such challenge with Pandemonium. Each bite revealed something almost familiar but somehow unexpected. There\u2019s a lot to enjoy, and an equal amount to ruminate on after finishing. I\u2019ll be looking for more from Gregory.Oh yes: a sincere thank you to Carly for inviting me to dinner."}, {"userName": "Terry ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1262683-terry", "userReview": "3 \u2013 3.5 starsI\u2019m going to say something that sounds unkind, but really it\u2019s a compliment from me: for a long time now I\u2019ve kind of thought of Daryl Gregory as something of a poor man\u2019s Sean Stewart. I must first admit that this happened before I actually read any of his books (this one is my first), and was based on what I could glean of them from the jacket blurbs and comments/reviews. It probably also comes from the fact that I once ran across a posting made by Gregory on a message board or blog somewhere where he bemoaned the fact that Sean Stewart was no longer writing and wished that he could still look forward to more books by him (a desire which I have ardently shared ever since Stewart decided to move on from writing into online game design) and so I thought maybe he was taking the bull by the horns and writing his own in the Stewart mould. I then started looking a bit more closely at Gregory\u2019s books, of which I had been only peripherally aware, and noticed that hey, they really did seem to cover similar thematic and conceptual areas: both wrote what I suppose would be classified as \u2018urban fantasy\u2019 (though I hate the tag and don\u2019t tend to gravitate towards the stuff that normally ends up in that bin); both seemed to centre on a very \u2018realist\u2019 approach to character and setting with the major caveat that their worlds were impacted by one major \u2018speculative\u2019 element (whether it be magical or \u2018scientific\u2019) that introduced the bizarre into our mundane world; both seemed to be concerned not so much with stories about world-shaking battles or larger than life figures as much as about how the significant changes in their worlds impacted the lives of \u2018regular\u2019 people: how they struggled to maintain normalcy in the midst of chaos and confusion. Still I had never quite mustered up the desire to pick up one of his books for one reason or another until now. Maybe I was afraid of being disappointed. So how did this one go? In a nutshell I enjoyed it, but I wasn\u2019t blown away.Gregory\u2019s world-bending conceit in this one is certainly interesting: demonic possession is real, but these demons aren\u2019t satanic minions from hell (or at least we aren\u2019t sure of that \u2013 no one quite knows where they come from), but are instead more like semi-Jungian archetypes from the collective unconscious. They are monomaniacal entities obsessed with fulfilling some particular role or action: it might be the Painter who forces the possessed to depict the same picture or set of pictures over and over again in whatever medium happens to be handy whether it be paint, chalk, or the destroyed pieces of a popcorn machine; it might be the Captain, a shield-slinging hero who tends to manifest when people, especially soldiers, are in danger; perhaps it\u2019s the Truth, a much darker \u2018hero\u2019 who guns down anyone whose lies have offended his fine sensibilities; or maybe the Hellion, a Denis the Menace-like nuisance whose antics just might literally make you lose an eye. The victims of possession don\u2019t remember what happened while their body was being controlled from without, and many don\u2019t survive the experience. Our hero is Del Pierce, a man who has been drifting through life as little better than a loser, unable to hold down a regular job or maintain normal relationships, ever since he was possessed by the Hellion as a little boy. For many years he has been able to keep the voices in his head at bay, but recently something has been scratching at the back of his mind and he is returning home from a short stay in a mental institution, nearly broke and grasping at his last straws, in the hopes that he will be able to deal with his demons, whether real or imagined, once and for all.Del is quickly plunged into the bizarre world of ICOP, the international conference of academics and scientists who study the demons, each with their own, usually contradictory, theory of what is happening and how it might be fixed\u2026none of whom have managed to achieve any conclusive result. That is, of course, except for Dr. Ram, a rising star in the world of demonology whose new controversial theories just might give Del a chance at truly living a normal life. Paired with ICOP is the other side of the coin: the unsanctioned \u2018conference\u2019 DemoniCon: a mass of cosplaying demon-aficionados each of whom yearns for the \u2018glamour\u2019 of being possessed and many of whom see the demons not as a bane on human existence, but as a gift to be revelled in. Now all Del has to do is convince Dr. Ram he is not one of these looney \u2018demon groupies\u2019 and that he is in fact the only person who has been able to do the impossible: to trap the demonic entity of his possession in the bowels of his mind. Gregory populates his novel with an interesting and varied cast of characters, from Del Pierce the tortured possession survivor and his long-suffering brother & mother who have tried to help him deal with his broken life, to the sardonic exorcist-priest Mother Mariette (an obvious direct homage to Sinead O\u2019Connor) and many of the other oddball figures that populate both ICOP and DemoniCon (including a direct analogue to Philip K. Dick and his AI construct/demon VALIS). Despite many of the outlandish things that happen and entities that populate this world it was always believable because it was grounded in these characters who really did feel like real, multifaceted individuals. Gregory also manages to keep the plot moving at a good pace, with enough twists and turns to keep me interested and wraps it all up with a satisfying resolution. So what more did I want? I don\u2019t know that I could say anything was really missing. It was a fine book that simply didn\u2019t quite blow me away. Maybe it was just a \u2018first novel\u2019 thing. I\u2019ll certainly pick up another one of Gregory\u2019s books and see how he tackles his next foray into the real world turned upside down."}, {"userName": "Michelle Morrell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127000-michelle-morrell", "userReview": "When I read genre books, I tend to lump them into what I call the X-Files Categories. A book is either a monster-of-the-week novel (adventure and action and not a whole lot of substance), or a mythology read (slower, deeper, more cerebral). Reading through the first half of Pandemonium, I was ready for a monster-of-the-week ride. In here, demon possessions are real, accepted and fairly routine. The lead, possessed as a child, is hearing noises and seeing things that have led him to seek out answers.However, my assumptions were wrong, so wrong. I know from experience that Daryl Gregory can write an engaging novel, some pretty fun romps through contemporary science fiction. But instead of a superficial made-for-tv story, I was very pleasantly surprised at the depth that I found. Some really cool ideas about possession, archetypes, collective unconscious, the power of the mind and Jungian theory, and even an homage to Philip K Dick.

Taking place in a world much like our own, but with the critical difference that demonic possession occurs openly and is widely acknowledged (even if whether said demons are evil spirits or something else is hotly debated), Pandemonium is told from the perspective of Del, a young man who was possessed by one such demon when he was young. His story is different from almost everyone else who has ever been possessed, however, in that his demon has never gone away and remains locked inside of him, desperate to escape. Del seeks answers from his former therapist and multiple others, all while getting closer to the truth of what is actually scraping the inside of his mind with increasing power ...Part thriller, part road-read, part fantasy, Pandemonium has a few relatively dark and frightening scenes, but for a story about demons, this remains a relatively horor-free book. Instead, Gregory piles on the mystery about the etiology of the demons and the part that Del may play in their origins being revealed.It's a great-set up, and for a first novel, Gregory's prose shines. His ear for dialogue is spot on, and his characters - especially Del - feel fully realised and easy to connect with. Which makes it all the more disappointing that the last third of the novel falls somewhat flat, with the eventual revelation being fairly standard and not able to justify the lengthy journey to get there.Still, this is a first published novel, and is impressive enough on that basis. It's certainly readable and most readers will likely enjoy the journey if they can keep their overall expectations in check.3 Unwanted Passengers for Pandemonium."}, {"userName": "Sandi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811687-sandi", "userReview": "Pandemonium is a book that's been coming up in my Amazon recommendations fairly regularly.

But once I started reading I was hooked.Pandemonium isn't quite fantasy (it quickly reveals itself to have elements of Alternate History & SF). Gregory creates a world where demonic possession is normal, sort of, at least society's learned to deal with it when it happens; but the story of Del, who was once Possessed as a boy is the heart of the narrative. It has a personal, intimate tone. The story starts out gently and then soon winds up into a thrilling pace.Interspersed throughout the book are interludes, eyewitness accounts of several of these 'demons', which in their brevity and scope, complement the story-arc without slowing it down.If I'm to compare Gregory to writers, I'd say it would be Tim Powers, James Blaylock, and a less surreal Philip K. Dick.Pandemonium is one of the most clever books I've read in recent memory; the internal logic of his premise is strong, as are his characters; I was left guessing all the way to the final chapters (I'm often able to figure stuff out quickly), and endings are tricky things, but Gregory manages to come up with one that, while open-ended on the broader scale, is perfect for the storyline.There are hidden bonuses for genre & comic book fans, but Gregory's storytelling is sublime enough so as not to make the book exclusionary to those not familiar with genre.Excellent stuff, one of my favorite reads in the past couple of years."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve", "userReview": "3 starsI liked this story\u2019s concept but the execution fell short, partly due to some editing mistakes (is Del\u2019s brother \u201cLew\u201d or \u201cLou\u201d?), and partly the novel\u2019s wildly inconsistent pacing. It was a unique story and actually pretty good taking into account this is a debut novel. His writing definitely improves with his later books, especially We Are All Completely Fine.This book is definitely off-beat and wonderfully strange. There are tons of cultural and sci-fi/ fantasy references (the most humorous was Philip K. Dick being possessed by the demon, Valis), and many fantastically weird characters.

Possession Disorder Variant. Socially Constructed Alternate Identity. Demonic possession. Whatever the term, Del Pierce is all too familiar with the process. While the hundred-odd \"strains\" of demons in Del's world aren\u2019t interested in temptation or damnation, no one wants a demon to jump to them. When a demon possesses a person, acts out a familiar role, a static pattern, and woe betide anyone who gets in its way. The Truth, wrapped in a trenchcoat and fedora, brings swift and bloody justice upon deceivers. Smokestack Johnny rides the trains in an eternal breakneck journey. The Captain carries his unwilling victim into heroic, desperate, and usually tragic last stands. The world has adapted. Every restaurant keeps a massive yellow chair for Fat Boy; airports keep altars to the Kamikaze; hospitals know that if a blonde-ringleted girl in a white nightgown is seen, the Angel is on the prowl, seeking out elderly patients to lull into eternal rest.Del Pierce hasn\u2019t been home in years. But now he is getting desperate, and all of his options seem to be lead back to Chicago. Back to his home. After a brief delay at the airport--the Painter took one of the passengers, and since no one wanted the demon to jump, they just let him do his thing-- Del is finally heading home to face his mother and Very Bigger Brother. He still doesn't know how to break the news.The thing\u2019s inside my head, Mom, and it\u2019s trying to get out.Daryl Gregory has swiftly become one of my favourite new finds of the year. It\u2019s hard to say anything much about the book without spoilers, but I love the world and characters that Gregory created. The core idea--that almost superhero-like entities who jump and possess at random rather than keeping fixed identities-- is so tantalizing and peculiar that I couldn\u2019t wait to learn more. The story also manages to weave in quite a bit of vintage popular culture, and while most of it lost me, I loved the segments that included classic scifi authors such as Philip K Dick and the apparently impossible-to-pronounce Van Vogt.Del, the narrator, is a sympathetic and relatable, his personality riddled with the contradictions and imperfections that are so quintessentially human. Above all, I love his constantly irreverent sense of humour. As he describes himself:We\u2019d understood from high school on that it was Lew\u2019s job to make good grades, find a high-paying career, buy a two-story house in the suburbs, and generally become Dad. It was my job to fuck up. Occasionally this annoyed me, but most of the time I was comfortable with the division of labor.Even in moments of drama, desperation, and despair, Del can't relinquish the wordplay. A few Del-isms:And now we were lost. Or rather, the world was lost. The GPS told us exactly where we were, but had no idea where anything else was. Permanent Global Position: You Are Here.She was seventy, seventy-five years old, a small bony face on a striated, skinny neck: bright eyes, sharp nose, and skin intricately webbed from too much sun or wind or cigarettes. She looked like one of those orphaned baby condors that has to be fed by puppets.There was no bathroom: no bath, no room, not even room for a bath. From the smell, the walls were insulated with old fish wrap.The coffee was terrible and the bacon was ordinary, but the pancakes were avatars of some perfect Ur-cake whose existence until now could only be deduced from the statistical variations in other, lesser pancakes.The rest of the cast is equally wacky and fun, from Del\u2019s nerdy Very Bigger Brother to his all-seeing, all-knowing, cookie-baking- mom to Mother Mariette the Kabuki exorcist priest. Yet occasionally, accentuated by his forlorn attempts at comedy, Del's pain and desperation can be almost palpable.Hope wasn\u2019t a thing with feathers, it was a hundred-pound ball and chain. All you had to do was drag that sucker to the edge and throw it over first.While it wasn't hard to guess what was going on long before Del did, I still found the various revelations riveting, and the conclusion utterly satisfying. Pandemonium is as much about fun as philosophy, and while it doesn\u2019t have a single straightforward message, the issues that it grapples with are intriguing and thought-provoking. In the end, demon-possessed or not, the questions are all the same: what is the purpose of it all? What good can be done in this time, in this body? How can one protect against a disinterested, omnipotent foe? In Del's world, demons are indefatigable, inevitable, endlessly repeating patterns that cannot be avoided or conquered or overcome. Archetypes. Just like sacrifice. Or transformation.Maybe everyone in the world was this inconsistent, this fragmented. All we could see of each other\u2014all we could see of ourselves\u2014was a ragged person-shaped outline, a game of connect-the-dots without enough dots.\nExcerpted from my review on BookLikes, which contains additional quotes and spoilers that I was too lazy to copy over."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "Despite the title, this is science fiction not horror.

The actual reason for these demons are unknown but they are called by names like The Captain, The Painter, and The little Angel. From this premise arises a intriguing take on the demon possession idea. The author is clearly influenced by many of the classic science fiction icons including Phillip K.

In fact, an elementary knowledge of The Golden Age of Science Fiction will enhance your enjoyment of this work but is not essential.

Various archetypical demons (Truth, Captain Valiant, the Angel of Death*, to name a few) are showing up, hijacking the bodies of randomly chosen hosts and disrupting public order by behaving demonically. Collateral damage to the unlucky host can be anything from mild trauma to death. Nobody really understands what is causing this epidemic of demonic possession which has spawned a plethora of \"demonologists\" in a broad assortment of flavors. Jungian psychologists, neuropsychologists, priests, psychics, mediums, and various other charlatans all have suggestions about the best approach to exorcism, but not much success.The issue has become urgent for Del, Pandemonium's first person narrator. At age six, Del was taken over by a demon called Hellion (kind of a scary, more dangerous, version of Dennis the Menace). Though he seemed to make a full recovery, recent events suggest that the demon never left. The story follows Del's efforts to get to the root of his problem through to its ultimate resolution. Demonic possession is well outside my usual reading beat, but this book seemed to be attracting a lot of positive attention, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Overall verdict: I thought \"Pandemonium\" was a fairly decent story, but nothing exceptional. StrengthsDaryl Gregory writes well.Pacing was good.Decent plot with a reasonably satisfactory resolution. COMPLETELY VAMPIRE-FREE!!!PALINDROMES!!!It's short.WeaknessesThe alternate reality that is the setting for the story is not particularly convincing. The development is a little perfunctory - Gregory keeps a tight focus on Del's story arc and doesn't really explore his premise beyond what he needs to resolve Del's situation.At times the exposition was a little too oblique - key plot developments were not always clear, or details were blurred.The little in-joke references to Philip K Dick, AE van Vogt, and the like may delight SciFi aficionados, but they sailed right over my ignorant head.COMPLETELY VAMPIRE-FREE!!! *Think Oscar, the kitty of doom.(http://stupac2.blogspot.com/2007/08/o...)"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/744602-lori", "userReview": "What a terrific debut!

That is the phenomenon behind the alternative world Gregory otherwise sketches. Some possessions provoke deadly accidents, and one demon, a little girl in a long white dress, is an angel of death for those already suffering terminal illnesses. Others are destructive or merely disconcerting intruders society has adjusted to.As a child Del Pierce was possessed by the demonic version of Dennis the Menace known as The Hellion. Most of the previously possessed get on with the lives, but Del knows that the demon is still trapped inside his brain, literally hammering to get out.Gregory novels are stories about family, friendship, and all the other ties that bind. They just happen to take place in a society undergoing a world-changing phenomenon. Pandemonium was his first novel, and he already knew the fictional territory he would make his own. It\u2019s a pleasure to read, and it includes Philip K. Dick as a character."}, {"userName": "Lea", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea", "userReview": "This book had a great premise -- modern day demon possession, set in a world similar to our own.Gregory does a wonderful job with the alternative history here -- Eisenhower is killed by a demon known as the Kamikaze, leading to a persecution of and prejudice towards Japanese-Americans -- and he ties together all the bits and pieces fairly well.I couldn't give this more than three stars, though, for a couple of reasons. One, I felt like there was just too much going on in this book. There's a lot of running from one place to another, the characters jumping from one conclusion to another -- it was difficult to keep track of all the ideas. The other problem I had was with the characters themselves -- I just didn't really like anyone except for Del's brother, Lew. And I could see a lot of people not really liking him!

That is actually praise, because any book that makes me care about the characters enough to hurt for them is a win as far as I am concerned.Honestly, I think it helps a lot in appreciating this book if you have a background in classic science fiction. At the very least, it enables you to appreciate both the ironic and the humorous elements in the book. But in general, the book is a riveting read. It moves fast, has successful twists (twists that surprise but then settle organically into the progression of the story), has rich and dimensional characters, and the central mystery of the book is unique and captivating. The author's alternate reality was convincing because the human reactions to the differences between this history and our own were entirely believable.This book is beautifully written. Grounded but occasionally lyrical prose and a knack for creating poignancy with subtlety. I was deeply touched by this book and it left me with a lot of thoughts on the human condition to mull over. On the strength of this book, I'm going straight to the author's next novel, The Devil's Alphabet, and looking forward to more in the future."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250814-mark", "userReview": "Wow. An unexpected gem.The premise is simple: A world just like ours except that possession by demons is real. It happens infrequently and is usually brief, leaving the victim shaken, but unharmed. Except for a few. You see, there are different demons that have been identified. The Little Angel, who possesses only girls between 10 and 12 with long curly dark hair and whose kiss can kill. The Painter, who uses materials at hand to paint specific pictures without saying a word, and then departs. The Truth, whose fedora, overcoat, and guns are usually the last thing a notorious liar sees. And so on...Del Pierce is a down-on-his-luck graphic designer who was possessed by the Hellion at age five. Unlike other victims, however, he feels the demon has never left. He can feel it there, in his head, making noises and rattling the bars of the mental cage. He's afraid it's going to get out.This is where the story starts. I'm going to leave out spoilers and say that there are a couple of meaningful twists that take the storyline in interesting new directions. And, while I was on vacation, it was mostly the quality of the book that compelled me to gobble this up in one day.

And of course how could one expect any less originality in this take on possession from the man who's written the most original zombie story to have come out in ages possible ever. From the excellent storytelling to strong characters to realistic dialogue and great pacing, all things about this book work and well. What an exceptionally talented author. Local library has this listed as horror or it could probably fall under fantasy, but this really is one of those exceptional books that defies genre limitations and should probably just be considered literature, fiction at its finest.

Ordinary men, women, and children are the targets of entities that seem to spring from the depths of the collective unconscious, pop-cultural avatars some call demons. There\u2019s the Truth, implacable avenger of falsehood. The Captain, brave and self-sacrificing soldier. The Little Angel, whose kiss brings death, whether desired or not. And a string of others, ranging from the bizarre to the benign to the horrific.As a boy, Del Pierce is possessed by the Hellion, an entity whose mischief-making can be deadly. With the help of Del\u2019s family and a caring psychiatrist, the demon is exorcised . . . or is it? Years later, following a car accident, the Hellion is back, trapped inside Del\u2019s head and clamoring to get out.Del\u2019s quest for help leads him to Valis, an entity possessing the science fiction writer formerly known as Philip K. Dick; to Mother Mariette, a nun who inspires decidedly unchaste feelings; and to the Human League, a secret society devoted to the extermination of demons. All believe that Del holds the key to the plague of possession\u2013and its solution. But for Del, the cure may be worse than the disease.", "title": "Pandemonium", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3191189-pandemonium", "average": 3.82, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320403877l/3191189.jpg", "reviews": 390, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1343790.Daryl_Gregory", "name": "Daryl Gregory"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Horror", "Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3191189-pandemonium", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8194322-pandemonium", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13365432-pandemonium", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16070821", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32827398-spoonbenders", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9466865-raising-stony-mayhall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910129-afterparty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20344877-we-are-all-completely-fine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22238192-harrison-squared"]}
