The quality is quite high to begin with but unfortunately gets worse as the book goes on.Dark Past is the best story. Set in 13th century England, Knight Templar and ancestor of Bruce Wayne, Joshua of Wainwright, is lured to a cursed castle by the ghost of his dead (or is she?) wife to battle the evil sorcerer, Vandal Savage - in a medieval Batman outfit of course!The story is exciting by turns as Batman infiltrates Vandal\u2019s fortress and fights through his monster army. The fantasy element works quite well with Batman - I\u2019ve noticed that Batman stories set in the past tend to work while the ones set in the future don\u2019t. Scott Hampton\u2019s painted art is pretty decent and a nice change of pace from how Batman comics usually look, if a bit static-looking (like most painted art). This observation is neither here nor there but his Batman helmet design looks like it heavily influenced the Batman helmet in Zack Snyder\u2019s Batman v Superman movie.Dark Present is about Bruce Wayne\u2019s dad (this is an Elseworlds alternate-timeline remember) creating a space-laser to destroy a meteor hurtling towards Earth. Shit goes down and directionless Bruce is thrown into the role of masked avenging vigilante!The story is very silly but likeable for being so. The problem is that it\u2019s very rushed. Suddenly Bruce decides to come up with a Bat-costume and somehow instantly knows how to be Batman?! And then the finale - no, it definitely needed more pages to fully flesh-out. Kudos to Barr for his imaginative, ambitious story but it hangs together poorly. Gary Frank and Cam Smith\u2019s art though is very good.Dark Future rounds out the book and it\u2019s easily the worst part. Set in the 26th century, mankind has for some reason chosen to give apes the ability to speak and think and they\u2019re now a part of our society! Batwoman takes on Vandal Savage and a meteor\u2019s involved again.We finally find out Vandal Savage\u2019s goal that he\u2019s been pursuing this entire time and it\u2019s pretty damn flimsy and underwhelming. It also doesn\u2019t really explain his motivation for specifically killing descendants of the Wayne family. I\u2019m not much of a fan of Scott McDaniel and Bill Sienkiewicz\u2019s scratchy, busy artwork though it appropriately complements Barr\u2019s messy plot. Ape Robin was kinda cool, I suppose.It has its moments, particularly at the start, but Dark Knight Dynasty is just a so-so Batman/Elseworlds book - nothing anyone except fans needing a Batman fix should bother checking out."}, {"userName": "Rick Hunter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20271842-rick-hunter", "userReview": "as per my usual, I'll start with the art. There are 3 different artists whose work is included inside and an additional one on the cover. The one one on the cover, Brom, is from right down the road from where I grew up. Brom has the painted art style that I don't think really fits superhero comics. There Have been some good painted covers through the years, but most of those were painted by Alex Ross. The style isn't necessarily bad. I just don't want to see that in a Batman comic. The same goes for Scott Hampton's painted art in story #1. Story #2 drawn by Gary Frank had the best art of the book. It isn't up to my normal standards of comic art, but is by far the best of these three. Scott McDaniel & Bill Sienkiewicz provide the art for the last story. This art reminds me of the stuff that came out in late 70's and early 80's for some reason. It is definitely not up to par with the great artists of the past 20 years. Overall I'd give the art 2.5 stars.All 3 of the stories were written by Mike W. Barr. The writing isn't great, but it does a good job of linking all 3 stories together by using one of the often overlooked DC villains, Vandal Savage. Seeing Savage in the comic was by far the coolest thing about the book. The story would not have worked at all without him. This was good for an Elseworlds story, but unless you are an absolute die hard Batman fanatic, there is no need to read this. Writing gets 2 1/2 stars as well."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16318868-ashley", "userReview": "Actual Rating would be a 2.5. I have not had much contact with Elseworlds and truth be told, I didn't really pay attention to the fact that this was Elseworlds when I bought it. Or rather, traded in a bunch of crap I didn't want and used my store credit on this.\"Dark Past\":I hated this art. I almost always hate this style of art. I dislike the lack of linear lines and details, the abuse of shadowing and the overall blah-ness of it all. This is one of those times that I am glad that the entire graphic is not done by one artist, as I don't think that I would have been able to finish it. The writing was ok, but the story-line was pretty boring. \"Dark Present\":Much better art work. Not the best ever, but more to my liking. The overall story in this one wasn't terrible but again, not a favorite Bat-story.\"Dark Future\":Ok, this was a jumbled mess with some nice panels of art but for the most part, it wasn't much better than the first story in terms of art. The writing didn't feel like the other two comics either. It was hard to follow who was saying what and there was just an over-load of dialogue in this last tale. And really... monkey Robin?Not the best choice that I have ever made when trading in books but at least I can say that I read it and experienced a bit of Elseworlds."}, {"userName": "Nicholas Grugin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18572850-nicholas-grugin", "userReview": "This trade was ok. It has essentially three stories with a central plot thread \"Vandal Savage wants to get ahold of the meteor that gave him his immortality\"The art and story for \"Dark Past\" is great and a treat to read, the \"Dark Present\" story is a little more lacking but the art-style, though different, is still pretty good...really this trade just fails in the \"Dark Future\" story. The Dark Future story in the trade just tries soo hard to be Miller's DKR, and just doesn't deliver. The art-style in this story looks like Frank Miller's DKR style with even less coherence, and the story just feels all over the place. This trade is worth a library checkout maybe but, if it's in your \"bought backlog\", read it, and then sell it back"}, {"userName": "Andrew Ives", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5949552-andrew-ives", "userReview": "This book contains three stories, set a few hundred years apart - Dark Past, Dark Present, Dark Future - which have a common strand running through them. The first has pretty good art, kind of watercoloured but a crazy historical story about Knights Templar which isn't very 'Batmanny'. The middle story has better artwork and was more like a normal Batman episode, only with a crazy ending in space. The last was, for me, the worst - horrible scratchy art, and whilst imaginitive, the story was too crazy for my taste. A mixed bag, ranging from mediocre to bad, albeit in a glossy well-printed, nicely-bound book."}, {"userName": "Anastasia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1255223-anastasia", "userReview": "Picked this up in a half-price bin while I was at Wiscon. Fantastic art and an interesting rewrite of the Batman legend in a style that I almost found Whedonverse Slayer-esque. The final book in the sequence is particularly compelling, with its female lead, but the historical feel of the first is also impressive. A great book for enjoying Batman without keeping up with the worlds of continuity."}, {"userName": "Vivek", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/377696-vivek", "userReview": "An interesting idea (having the mantle of the Dark Knight passed on generationally through the Wayne family) that fails miserably. None of the characters are developed any where close to enough, and the plot suffers from similar lack of effort. The art work's not bad, but not nearly enough to save it. Disappointing."}, {"userName": "Earl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9370434-earl", "userReview": "Credit my biases.-Could Batman have passed something down the line, considering his crimefighting career? -There's only one immortal rival that Batman has: R'as al-Ghul.
