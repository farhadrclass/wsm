And if you knock here and there to sound the depths of his imagination and the depths of insight, one finds tinny, hollow sounds here and there. Perhaps more than 'here and there'. And so, it is not without cause...that many readers write Furst off as little more than a literary hack. Yes, perhaps. Who could argue. And yet..., reading him is much like sitting in the living room of your fancy U.S. apartment, watching Saving Private Ryan, listening to Edith Piaf on your smooth hi-fi, a cognac on the table... while flipping through a large volume of the photos of Brass\u00e4i. And it is not unappealing. There is little plot in Furst's novels, something he talks about, in fact, in this book:  \"Yet, a mystery. Hotel Dorado [a script that Jean Casson is producing] was luminous. Not in the plot -- somewhere in deepest Fischfang-land there was no real belief in plot. Life wasn't this, and therefore that, and so, of course, the other. It didn't work that way. Life was this, and then something, and then something else, and then a kick in the ass from nowhere....\" ( -- and there, in that last, sad cola, is the flaking, alas... of the gold plating....).But there is mood in Furst -- and for those who are fascinating by the period -- that mood is wonderfully sustained. And there is also character. Furst's leading characters -- like the Polish officer, and Jean Casson in this novel, are very appealing men...handsome, intelligent, humble, moral, but not simplistically so... attractive to women and to men both... -- and much the same can be said for many of his other characters... they are marvelously well drawn and vivid. And quite individual. Essentially good men and women, most of them.... Trying to survive in a world of moral ambiguities.Even the Nazis...\"They chatted for a time, nothing all that important, a conversation among men of the world, no fools, long past idealism. Poor Europe, decadent and weak, very nearly gobbled up by the Bolshevik monster. But for them. Not said, but clearly understood...\" (231)The prose is often lovely -- though always with that final undertaste of lead... In both senses of that word, of that metal... For it is lead that underlies the golden sheen, and lead that defines the moment... Europe at war...And then, of course, there is that train... from Paris to Barcelona, via Lyons and Port Bou -- resonant Port Bou...! -- which I myself took at the age of 17 -- and that suitcase -- I have an exact replica of it! -- cobbled tan, with green and red stripes.... So this is a book I'd have to love...!Anyway -- for those who like Furst (as I do, for all his flaws), this is one of his best.(rating always relative only to genre, of course...)"}, {"userName": "Dante", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1290802-dante", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of Alan Furst; I've read all and enjoyed of his 1940's era books -- most of them several times. Except this one. To me, Furst's novels have three great strengths. 1: Atmosphere -- an ability to transport the reader back to the smokey, uncertain times as WWII was getting started; 2: Great and believable characters -- people who are like those around you who happened to find themselves in compelling circumstances; and 3: Plausibility; unlike most \"spy novels,\" Furst's do not contain supermen, answers to problems don't fall out of the sky, smart people do smart things, some of which don't work. This one manages to miss on all three. He doesn't really hit on the atmosphere of the time; I can't say exactly why. His characters are not terribly interesting or sympathetic (although the Jean Casson returns in a later book as a much better character); and worst of all, this book illustrates many of the bad spy novel traits that his other books manage to avoid. Smart people do stupid things; spies confide in absolute strangers; people just happen to stumble on the hidden/lost things they were looking for; the hero has fabulous sex with a different woman each night. I guess this is where Furst learned what NOT to put in a spy novel.Read the others by Furst -- ALL of the others.

I wasn't particularly enamoured of the main character Jean Casson, French producer and would be spy. He was far too naive and self centred for his role here. Some of his actions simply didn't correlate to his character. Also, the novel just felt incomplete.On the positive side I love the way the author writes, the delivery of the story, the time depicted and the historical research that goes into these novels. The bar was raised high with the previous novels but this one just didn't reach the heights that I've come to expect."}, {"userName": "T.

They are atmospheric and very evocative. In some ways, they are all the same book and the same main character, but I don't that isn't necessarily a criticism. This is one of the best of the bunch.

He is a reluctant hero who is drawn into the secret war against the Nazi occupiers of France. With 'The World at Night', Furst is able to again relate the way WWII impacted typical Europeans in ways that most fiction and nonfiction writers who focus on Europe's second world war seem to often miss or overlook.

What Furst has created is an evocative exploration of what it was like to lose your country, way of life and future and then to have to continue living. It's an intelligent novel with authentic detail, moments of humour and terror, and a sting in the tail.

To a certain extent, they are all similar. A conflicted man, with some noble underpinnings gets drawn over his head into a world of intrigue that he only vaguely understands it. This time its a minor film producer just after the occupation. Furst has a wonderful way of making spying seem simultaneously noble and mundane, even a bit tawdry. For most of the book, its not quite clear whether Casson is a spy. He seems to have mixed views on the subject. But both the British and the Germans are determined to make him a spy, and he is left with little choice in the matter. What is clear is that little, or none, of his spying has any impact on any great events. The largest impacts they have are on Casson's love life, and his chance of survival. As always, the atmosphere is good, the characters interesting, the plotting slow but engaging. I especially like the part of the book that involved a purported plot to assassinate Franco. And as always, I'm left knowing that I will read more by him, but not feeling in any particular rush to do so."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "I haven\u2019t read Furst before, and picked this up because it was on sale.

The good kind of lost where you forget about passing time, missed train stops, your plan to go to bed at a reasonable hour. In The World at Night, a French film producer finds his life, along with everyone else\u2019s lives, upended by the German invasion of Poland and the sudden conquest of France. Jean Casson, in his early 40s, is mobilized to his astonishment and attached not unreasonably to a film crew, but France is defeated before his unit gets to do much than drive toward the collapsing front. Before long he is back in Paris trying to locate a normal life within occupied France. A Jewish screenwriter who is also a communist continues to write scripts for Casson while moving from house to house, woman to woman. The lover of Casson\u2019s ex-wife becomes something very like a collaborator, as does another friend. A business acquaintance involves him in an intrigue meant to be Casson\u2019s bit to aid the Resistance but it goes wrong and leads to both the British and the Germans suspecting him even as they recruit him as an agent. Into the mix is the re-kindled flames of a former romance, complicating the highly shadowed and deeply uncertain world Casson lives in. As always the dialogue is sharp, disciplined and real. The atmosphere redolent of another time and place that conjures familiarity where none exists. Some of it is done by such Furst touchstones as the Brasserie Heininger, the Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 American of Paris, where the hero of any Furst novels ends up for at least one meal, but mostly it\u2019s done with great writing, great research, and a great eye and ear for character and moments.

This one struck me as much more ordinary. It was so long before anything happened. And that narrator, George Guidall, with his whispery, insinuating voice, is not right for a World War II spy story. (Moreover, Guidall narrated a Daniel Silva thriller I listened to, so hearing him again reminded me of a book I'd just as soon forget.) But it comes back to The World at Night: if more had been happening, I would have been less distractible. I had bought The World at Night on sale at Audible, so maybe you could say I got what I paid for. But on the other hand if they want to sell more Alan Furst, they should have offered a bargain on one of the better ones. The book isn't badly written; it's just that the author sets the stage for nearly half of the book, or I guess this book is itself setting the stage for more Jean Casson adventures to come. Nor was the book startling or revelatory or funny. Finally, at the end, it became exciting and while that doesn't redeem the experience of this book it does help."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272061-jonathan", "userReview": "A swathe of sex scenes interspersed by ineffectual spying."}, {"userName": "Rachel Pollock", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5277674-rachel-pollock", "userReview": "Oh, but this was so gratifying.

Furst is a master of description and detail and with this book that is evident as ever. But is the book good? Can description and feeling be enough to carry a novel?Set almost exclusively in Paris in 1940, in the time leading up to, and during, German occupation the book tells the story of French filmmaker Jean Casson. Let's get out of the way quickly the discussion about Furst's technical skill when it comes to creating atmosphere. Reading his books I can almost feel the streets beneath my feet and the smoke hanging over a crowded Paris nightclub. The details are not to be missed: \"A cast of characters well beyond Jean Renoir. Ad\u00e8le, the niece from Amboise. Real nobility- look at those awful teeth. Washed-out blue eyes gazed into his, a tiny pulse beat sparrowlike at the pale temple.\"The man knows how to paint a picture in your mind.The problem is it can't carry a book. Unlike \"The Polish Officer\" there just isn't much story here. The character of Casson is likable enough. The other characters are also well written. The problem here is that we're always waiting for something to happen. I understand that he's trying to show the uncertainty of what was going to happen. The Germans had ran through Poland and even though there were indications that a treaty would be signed there was a huge amount of uncertainty of what Hitler was planning to do. Of course we know now that even while there were hopes of French acquiescence Hitler was also planning an invasion. The book is mostly effective showing this uncertainty but I can only take the scenes of parties and sexual encounters so much. These are supposed to be spy novels but there isn't much spying going on. I also understand that Furst is trying to show that common people can do extraordinary things in extraordinary circumstances. But what we see is Casson bumbling through encounters, being played by various sides. The problem here is that if I wanted normal I wouldn't be reading a spy novel set in World War II. I don't want ordinary characters. I want characters that are going to shoot first and ask questions later. Historical fiction or not reading a spy novel I want some action with my parties and sex.The story flows as such, it just isn't flowing very fast. The previous novel, The Polish Officer, was quickly paced and there as a lot going on as we followed, Captain Alexander de Milja's exploits following the fall of Warsaw, and Poland, to German forces. The book covered a lot of territory; not quite as much territory as Night Soldiers but it also didn't exhibit any of the problems that book had with story flow. We have none of that with The World At Night.What we do have is a moderately enjoyable read solely due to Furst's ability to create a lush atmosphere in which to place his characters. World War II certainly wasn't lacking in story lines which is why it is so difficult to understand why this novel moved so slowly. All that being said I did enjoy the book but after reading 4 of the Night Soldiers novels I'm getting to the point where it's clear that I'm not going to get much variety. I hope, with more novels to go, that I'm wrong but so far these stories have become pretty predictable."}, {"userName": "Ioana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1721356-ioana", "userReview": "3.5 stars, rounded up. Not one of Furst's best, but still a brilliantly bleak and realistic portrayal of life under Nazi occupation in France during WW2. Still learned more from this novel than I ever did in a history class, and as with other books by Furst, I was still compelled to look up every detail while my interest in the time period increased exponentially. And, as always, Furst' characterizations are incredible: many times I was compelled to pause and consider, \"what if that had been me?\" What does one do in a situation in which one is confronted with no good choices? In which one's decision is between betraying friends, family, and country, or being sent to a Nazi camp? In which one has to lie and embellish as a matter of course? What I love about Furst is that he does not sensationalize, his characters are not supermen, and the game is not a simple binary one of virtue vs. vice, evil vs. goodness. The world he portrays is messy, complicated, filled with people with competing and complex desires, needs, and values.Now, my beef with this particular novel is twofold:1. About 1/3 of the book is written in sentence fragments. Furst does this in his other books, too, but it's less jarring when it only occurs at the beginning of each chapter/section. Now, some literary writers can get away with unique stylistic quirks, but Furst' writing is not so poetic in nature that it can pull of fragments successfully... The World at Night was really getting on my nerves by the end--if I had not known Furst for the amazing author he can be, I probably would have quit at some point before reaching the end for this reason.2. The story is just so mushy-gushy and makes a lot less sense than the others in the series. In the middle of war, occupation, life-and-death situations, etc, all our main guy can think about is being with his girl. I read these for the WW2 portrayal, and not for the Harlequin-esque aspects. Now while I do appreciate that war tore loved ones apart and romantic love suffered as a consequence, and since this can be an important aspect overlooked in \"research\" or academics of the period--a novel or two about romantic love in the occupation is fine. But I am not appreciating that each and every single one of Furst' books in this series seem to eventually spiral around a love-story. Yes, romantic love is important, but it's not everything, and I'd be much more interested in other aspects of life during WW2 than lovers torn apart by fate and by stupidity or by unexplained plot twists (WHY oh why did the girl, Citrine, go to Lyons, in the unoccupied zone? We are never told, it seems just an artificial way to separate the lovers and to create a plot/tension...)"}, {"userName": "Kenyon Harbison", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3138878-kenyon-harbison", "userReview": "The novel is about the tribulations of a French film producer, Jean Casson, during the German occupation of Paris. It is a \"spy novel\" in the loose sense of the term, as are all of Alan Furst's novels that I have read so far. This is not the silly Robert Ludlum type of spy novel, in other words. You truly can FEEL Paris during the occupation. Where a Ludlum or (these days) a Patterson gives you a clunky, dropped-in sentence of superficial \"color,\" which, if you have half a brain in your head, you feel sure his assistant dug up on Google in two minutes of research, Furst gives you a whole world of both emotional and physical detail, a world that is the result of painstaking research into primary sources.Furst novels are not about plot. The hero always survives, so in that sense they are genre-complying. But other than that, they meander, they dip, they back-track. Here, for example [plot spoiler, note], Casson goes on his first spying mission after he is recruited, but it turns out it was not a spy mission at all -- he was simply the patsy of a wartime profiteer seeking to steal money from British intelligence. And yet, Casson becomes a spy. This sort of thing almost always works. (Imagine The Daughter of Time by Josephine Tey, but a spy novel set in Paris, and not nearly so boring as that \"classic\" is.) Where it doesn't work here is in Casson's relationship to Citrine, a young interracial actress. Casson is a great character, and totally believable. But here is a philandering forty-year-old, and suddenly he is in love with an old fling, and you never really understand why. And really her character is so sketchily drawn that you REALLY never know why she is in love with him. Oh sure there is an Occupation, people seek comfort, young girls seek security, but it's not meant to be about that; Furst really means you to think they are in love. It just doesn't work. Not enough basis for the love. Furst tries to get you to buy it with some poetic language, but in the end the relationship with Citrine \"fails\" as a writerly endeavor for the inverse of reason Furst's description of Occupied Paris succeeds: a dirth of facts.Furst's attempt to buy your belief in their love with 'poetic' writing highlights another error he makes, which is that he gets a bit too mannered with his prose sometimes, trying to evoke too much meaning by using too many deliberately incomplete sentences, that sort of thing. But these are minor quibbles. The guy is an amazing writer, and this is another hugely entertaining and fast-reading novel that nonetheless feels weighty and important."}, {"userName": "Janette Fleming", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2917516-janette-fleming", "userReview": "SynopsisParis, 1940.

Later Jean Casson becomes entangled, albeit reluctantly, in the shady and dangerous world of espionage.

Also he reignites an old flame an actress named Citrine, this romantic liaison adds another layer to the heady mix.The real achievement of the author is showing the mundane, normal every day experiences like eating, drinking, working, loving against the backdrop of the terror of the occupation and this is what makes the book so \"real.\""}, {"userName": "Ric", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990467-ric", "userReview": "Historical drama with a hint of a spy story.The Germans break through the Maginot line just as French movie producer bon vivant Casson is discovering that at 41 he is fallible and failing.

This started as a potential spy novel but turned out to be an anguished look at the face of occupation and war. In those times, the oppressed find out how strong they are within. A human spirit that connects right back to when we were non-sentient and merely animals. The spy segment towards the end of the book is much too subtle and peripheral to be the focal point.

He is a reluctant hero who is drawn into the secret war against the Nazi occupiers of France. With 'The World at Night', Furst is able to again relate the way WWII impacted typical Europeans in ways that most fiction and nonfiction writers who focus on Europe's second world war seem to often miss or overlook. Once again the atmosphere of the time has been well captured, and the characters have been well depicted, even some of the minor supporting ones. Perhaps the initial part of the book is slightly ponderous, but it makes up for it in the latter stages. Hopefully this is not the last we will see of Jean Casson, as the ending seemed rather vague."}, {"userName": "V.R.

THE WORLD AT NIGHT is a well-written, atmospheric novel, but I never connected with the protagonist. Since I have an affinity for flawed, conflicted characters, and Jean is nothing if not flawed and conflicted, I'm surprised the book didn't work for me on this level. Wish I could be more specific. Possibly because I\u2019m writing about this period myself, I was distracted by the trappings\u2014occupied France\u2014when I should have been focused on Jean. There is a second book by Furst featuring the same protagonist titled, RED GOLD. It\u2019s on my TBR pile. I intend to to give Jean Casson a second chance to woo me, because I think the one failing of this book may have been me."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed", "userReview": "This was my first Allan Furst book. Like his other novels, it is character driven rather than plot driven. He resembles John LeCarre in that way.This one grabbed me because it captures better than anything else I've read what it must have been like to be a Parisian during the German occupation. People just trying to get by while struggling with their feelings that they should be helping with the resistance.The ending caught me by complete surprise and left a hollow feeling in my stomach. I certainly enjoyed and highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be introduced to Furst's work."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1439856-david", "userReview": "This is certainly vivid and conveys a sense of the intended period. I kind of wish there was less foreseen in it. I can't say anything wasn't expected, just some things that happened in that period. I'm not sure what exactly I would have been looking for, but it isn't there. I just thought \"Yup, something like that probably happened\" and wasn't real interested beyond the historical feel. I suppose that can be all there is, but I would have liked a reason to read beyond that."}, {"userName": "Barksdale Penick", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5282589-barksdale-penick", "userReview": "This is such a good book, if you like espionage set in World War II. At the end, there is a list of historical sources relied on by Furst, which I would like to delve into, as his books seem so well informed. He does a particularly strong presentation of the Soviet underground, and how they operated. This book is set in Paris, with a former film producer on the run from the Germans. Our hero has adventures and love, failures and scares. It is really well put together."}, {"userName": "Kay Kenyon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17111623-kay-kenyon", "userReview": "A startling re-creation of France under German occupation with an everyman protagonist capable of sacrifice and courage. Although the wandering plot makes for a slow read, I loved the fabulous details of Paris, the Gestapo, and French life. I find Furst's writing absorbing, smart, witty and deeply humanistic. I'm making a tour of all his books--even if just to learn how to write dialogue.

Hell no. Could I put it down for a second? Not even remotely. Basically a novel featuring almost everything I love in a noir story. Though the female characters were paper thin I was still incredibly sucked into the whole affair. Goodreads lists this as Book 4, thats not the case at all, at least narratively. This is simply the fourth book on Occupied Paris the author has written, it is wholly original (although he did later write a sequel to it.)"}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5983157-betty", "userReview": "I'm a fan of Furst's novels, not that I've read all of them (yet). The World at Night was murky and I got lost a couple of times. So, if you want to read this historical spy novel, my advice is to slow down and pay attention to details. It's tempting to read faster and faster as the story is gripping and you want to find out what happens, which is what I did. Don't."}], "description": "Paris 1940.
