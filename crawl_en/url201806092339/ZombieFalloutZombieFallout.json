I, however, am not one of those people. The only enjoyment I received from this book was that apparently I'm not alone in legitimately wanting a Z apocalypse to happen. After that heap of praise it should be noted that there is a HUGE difference between juvenile humor and lame, cringe-worthy attempts at humor. The first chapter alone reminded me of watching a stand-up comedian and literally looking away because I was so embarrassed at his/her comedic abilities. Except apparently this author is Dane Cook and I'm sitting in the back row still in complete disbelief at how people deem this stuff funny.There's more to be said about why this book is god awful, but I'll sum it up in one sentence. This author cannot write. I'm only mildly surprised that amazon ratings fooled me yet again, but I completely expected to come here and see this book ripped to shreds. Even the most die-hard zombie fanatics (I include myself in said category) should avoid the book. This is not the zombie epic you are looking for."}, {"userName": "The  SciFi Chick Muses", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4983678-the-scifi-chick-muses", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book. Really!!! And after reading all the great reviews I didn't hesitate to purchase. Unfortunately, I did not like this book. To start off with I had a hard time to adjusting the \"humor\" that everyone else praised in their reviews. For me, it was like when you watch a movie and the lovers stop to \"make out \" as danger is about to overtake them. It was infuriating! I really disliked being in the middle of an action sequence and I would be forced to stop to listen to the \"'funny\" ramblings going on in the head of the protagonist. Also, the female characters in the book are irritating and bossy and I'm not sure why the other characters in the book have such high opinions of them. They take stupid risks, that put others in danger and worry about pointless things.***Warning Tiny Spoiler**** For example, the protagonist is \"Zombie proofing\" his home and his wife is worried about the how now the resale value of the house has just gone down. Really? I don't feel like this author knows how to write strong women. However, despite all my annoyance with the book I kept on reading. I read on because I was hoping it would get better. After all, this series has so many fans. ***Warning minor spoiler*** But, when the author stops the storyline during the zombie attack and takes time to add a storyline about a serial killer, I was just to mad to finish. I am disappointed because I was really looking forward to reading a new Zombie series. I know I won't be picking up book two. The main character says something in the book that might explain why I didn't \"get this book\". He says...\" if you don't understand New England humor, then you'll never understand me.\" That's not the exact quote but close enough. Well, I guess I don't understand. By the way, I did eventually finish this book in a desperate attempt that it would get better. It didn't."}, {"userName": "Erin (Bluestocking Bookworm)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5352687-erin-bluestocking-bookworm", "userReview": "This review can also be seen at: Written Permission: A Reading and Writing BlogI love a good zombie book. Let me say it again. I love a good zombie book. This does not fall into that category.I knew right away that I wasn't going to enjoy this book. There are too many inconsistencies. Right off the bat we have our main protagonist (Michael Talbot) encountering zombies. He is excited about it. Even the most avid zombie enthusiast would be scared out of their mind if the dead started to rise. And the zombie apocalypse has been happening for an hour, and here are a ton of decomposed corpses, maggots and all. Hmm. That doesn't seem right.The book blames the zombification of the human race on H1N1 vaccines, but it doesn't go into the science of it at all. When coming from something like The Newflesh Trilogy by Mira Grant (where she did her damn research on virology and medicine) it is very flat and unsatisfying.Michael Talbot is a former marine. This is something we are reminded of every other page. He is also a special blend of chauvinist and misogynist. Every time he notices a female character, the first thing he comments on is how attractive she is. He looks down on anyone who doesn't know how to use a gun, or who is on the elderly side (unless they prove that they know how to use a gun). On many occasions he is contemplating his emotions and his desire to not kill the zombies, especially if they are sentient. And then he brushes off these thoughts as feminine and tells himself he will be needing tampax next.In short, I hated the main character. A male main character doesn't have to be all touchy-feely to garner a connection from female readers. But (for me, anyways) he sure as hell has to treat female characters with respect.From an author standpoint, I found that Mark Tufo didn't treat his female characters with respect either. They are all the flimsy, harping, whiny sort that men constantly whine about, but in reality are not that common. Again, not every female character has to be a gun-toting badass to be respected, but they should have some redeeming qualities to them.There were some plot devices that, at least looking at the first book alone, really didn't fit. The book would have been a whole lot shorter without them, so maybe they were thrown in for bulk. There was the side plot about the almost cheating that happened between Michael and his smoking hot friend. Because men and women can't be friends without women having an ulterior motive. Then there was the woman zombie who macked on our main character, sending him into some sort of insanity for three days where he spoke the Lord's Prayer. Backwards. In Latin. Which his wife just happens to speak. And there was a situation with a very sick man having a zombie woman in his basement as a plaything. Seriously? What does that have to do with anything?The writing was just shy of horrid. I wished it was a physical book when I read the phrase \"...with precise precision.\" so I could throw it down in disgust. But it was an e-book, and it isn't my e-reader's fault that the editing was bad. So I opted not to break it. There was a lot of \"Because I am a marine!\" and \"I just happened to know\" and \"I just happened to be there\" going on. It was weak, and it didn't sit well with me. The author attempts to infuse the book with humor, which was fine at first, but it gets old very fast. The foreboding was heavy handed, and there was no element of surprise when something bad happened.And then we have Tommy. I liked Tommy as a character. He is a special needs kid who is rescued along with Michael Talbot's son from the Walmart where they work. He has the voice of Ryan Seacrest in his head that tells him what to do, and what is going to happen. As a character idea, Tommy was solid. But how he was written was not. Instead of acknowledging that he would have to be a high functioning individual to work at Walmart (even through an advanced hiring system) we get the Tommy who can't eat without smearing food all over his face, the Tommy who is incapable of proper speech, etc. Bad form.Also, don't you think if rigor mortis was a problem for the zombies (as is mentioned when they try to do things like move their hands a certain way) they might, I don't know, not be moving at all?I am very glad this book is done.Bottom Line: There are definitely better zombie books out there."}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4195455-jenn", "userReview": "I purchased the first 3 in this series based on Amazon and Goodreads reviews alone.

I found it boring, at time it made me feel queasy, the attempt at humour grated on my nerves and the whole thing left me feeling puzzled and asking 'why is this book so highly rated and praised?'I had to admit defeat after reading the latest vomit inducing descriptions about worms and maggots inside grotesquely shaped, Daisy Duke wearing fat zombie girls outside Walmart. It was just too much.There was a lot of cringe worthy juvenile humour and many of them were cheap shots at the usual suspects: the over weight (there were lots of fat jokes), gender, sex etc...'...I would have to lug Henry because he couldn't walk more than two hundred yards before he would begin panting like a sex offender at a cheerleader convention.'But I admit to laughing at one of Michael's lines at the start because it was unexpected given the situation. \u201cI see a tongue! Some asshole is licking my peephole.\u201dZombie Fallout is told from Michael Talbot POV and it's about how he ensures his family's survival after the H1N1 virus epidemic leads to the zombie apocalypse. But Michael is prepared for the apocalypse; his ammunition/gun stockpile rivals that of the local gun shop or police station. It's like he knows, Man! *Rolls eyes* Michael's wife comes across as incompetent, shrewish, at times cruel and a raging bitch.e.g. When he tried to take his 15 year old son as backup to rescue their other son who was stuck on the roof of a building surrounded by zombies:\"You can't!\" she yelled.Travis rushed to my defence. \"Mum, Dad needs my help.\"\"He can do it on his own,\" she retorted.\"You're my baby!\"\"Hon-\" I started.\"You shut up!\" she spat fiercely. \"Travis is my baby, he's my flesh and blood!\"\"And what am I!\" I yelled back.\"You're just some guy I met!\" she retorted.' He's forced to tell her what to do, pull her out of the horror induced mental paralysis he likes to call 'Traceyville' a.k.a 'blond moment'... 'We sometimes joked when my wife had a blond moment or just lapsed out of our reality into her own made up one. Life came back into her eyes, and just like that, she was back.' Michael has to reason with and also explain the obvious to Tracy:\"Forget the damn puke!\" she yelled\"Shouldn't we try to help?\"\"No, \" I mumble.\"What? Speak up, I can't hear your altruism.\" she retorted acerbically.'\"Listen, if we stop, we become vulnerable, and we don't know if the person we would be helping is infected. We can't take the chance, we have to look out for us.\" I argued.So far, I haven't seen a strong woman, just an emotionally immature woman but she seems to be a perfect match for Michael because he's no prize either. Michael is a former Marine and an average Joe in character but in the blink of an eye he becomes the man, the one most likely to survive the zombie apocalypse. He's a quick thinker, faster and braver than his 15 year old son who is a mini Hercules in size and strength but somehow Michael is the one with all the good ideas. Michael is cleverer than everyone too, he is the first one to act, he is the only one who has a plan and everyone's survival depends on him. Yep, we have a Mary Sue hero a.k.a. Gary Stu!I read few more pages to see if anything changes but nothing did. There was nothing to like about any of the characters, they were all flat and uninteresting and I found it difficult to connect with any of them. The narrative, writing style, humour, characters, especially the main character...non of it worked for me. This book had one thing going for it...the zombies were different here, they seemed to have emotions and some sort of thinking or group mind-set that I found interesting, but it wasn't intriguing enough to keep me reading.

It focuses on an ex-marine and his family as they try to survive the zombie apocalypse. I've read dozens of zombie books and enjoyed nearly everyone. The problem I have with Zombie Fallout isn't with the story. The problem is the writing.The book is overflowing with spelling and grammatical errors. In something that is self published, it's not surprising to find a few mistakes here and there, but Zombie Fallout has so many errors it's distracting.Another problem is the endless attempts at being funny. After a while it just becomes irritating. You'll find jokes about farts, pooping, needing a shower, the smell of zombies and more jokes about farts. If it smells bad it's funny and needs multiple jokes. I wish I had read this when I was 13 and could appreciate the humor.This is the first book in what looks to be at least a trilogy. I doubt I'll give this writer another try, but hopefully rest of the series received a bit more editing."}, {"userName": "Boss", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1330655-boss", "userReview": "Resources for Adults Horror SelectionI saw this book on a list of Best Science Fiction of the 21st Century. I've never thought of zombie novels as science fiction, but there are several on the sci fi lists, so maybe I'm the anomaly. In any case, Zombie Fallout had great ratings on goodreads, and the audio book was available for download from my local library, so I thought I'd give it a try.After listening to it, I'd say it's a better fit for horror than sci fi. Even if it is sci fi, it doesn't belong on the \"best of\" list! (It has since been bumped, which makes me wonder if it was spam-voted to the list in the first place.) More on that later.Zombie Fallout begins with a swine flu epidemic, circa 2009. In desperation, the CDC releases an untested flu vaccine that cures the flu but (surprise!) also turns recipients into zombies. The plague spreads quickly, and before long human survivors are outnumbered. Our protagonist, Mike, is an ex-marine survivalist who has been stockpiling weapons and MREs for years, just in case of apocalypse (zombie, or otherwise). The townhome complex where he lives with his family becomes a makeshift safe-haven for human refugees, with Mike as one of the more skilled and outspoken leaders. Most of the book is setup: excursions outside the compound to rescue survivors and gather supplies hint that these zombies are not the \"mindless\" zombies of horror flicks. Although the undead are slow-moving, their attacks seem coordinated. Predictably, a zombie horde descends on the compound and eventually breaches the defenses; they're not as dumb as they look, those zombies! Still, I hope I'm not giving too much away in saying that Mike and his family escape. (Hint: there are six sequels so far.)The story itself is interesting enough, but the storytelling is distractingly bad. It's told in first-person from Mike's point of view. His narrative style is amusing: he's manly and self-deprecating and full of corny jokes. Initially, I wanted to give the author (Mark Tufo) the benefit of the doubt and assume that any narrative awkwardness was intentional -- just part of Mike's casual, everyman style. Eventually, though, the painful phrasing (\"from which he came from\") and syntax/grammar errors (\"penultimate\" to mean \"ultimate\") were more than I could overlook. Even the sections that were told in another voice were painful. (Mike's wife narrates briefly, and there is (inexplicably) a section in the middle that is told from a third-person omniscient point of view.) This book needs an editor. Badly.Still, it was an amusing diversion during a long car ride. I just don't care enough about Mike to keep reading.I can see this book appealing to fans of zombie fiction who want a series they can stick with for a while. It's got humor, gore, action, and a protagonist with wit and charm. But unfortunately, it's so poorly constructed, I can't see myself recommending it very enthusiastically."}, {"userName": "Chris Walker", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5387421-chris-walker", "userReview": "Very new to novels of this genre(although huge fan of everything Zombie on Film), but after enjoying World War Z(Max Brooks)& Warm bodies (Isaac marion) in paperback, and with the arrival of my Christmas present kindle i read numerous Zed novels with great reviews on amazon.What can i say???

I was all set to enjoy a good old-fashioned zombie book - full of gore and violence, but what I got was a big heap of misogyny. The two main female characters, family members of the protagonist, a self proclaimed survivalist, don't even know how to load a gun. There is a whole section of the book devoted to their hi-jinks, from fiddling with the guns, to decided to go on a \"cigarette run\" in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, to running into a \"pornstar-look-a-like slut\" that tried to seduce the main character (because he is such a catch). Characters in books can be dumb. I understand that. However, this author comes across as juvenile and simplistic as a thirteen-year-old boy in his portrayal of women and gays (don't even get me started).

I found out about it after hearing the author, Mark Tufo in an interview wherein he discussed the origins of the ZF series and his journey in self-publishing. I was particularly intrigued by the fact that Mark Tuffo stated in the interview that the main character, whose initials mirror his own, was closely based on Tufo and his family. I thought it would be an interesting read/listen.Unlike some of the other people who rated this book poorly, while I thought the protagonist was more than a little goofy, I wasn\u2019t terribly annoyed by his jokes, which were for the most part unfunny. I just thought, oh he\u2019s a goof ball. That said, there were serious moments wherein the joking was sorely out of place and the effect would throw me out of the narrative as I attempted to figure out if I should be scared for the characters or if I should be laughing. The protagonist, I\u2019d decided, was juvenile, not very clever, thought way too much of himself and his looks, and frequently an ass. And because Tuffo stated that the character was based on him, I figured, Hmm, Tuffo must be too.The women are fairly one dimensional. They\u2019re weepy, bossy, and have attitude for absolutely no good reason. Cute, but no cigar on portrayals of women. The protagonist had a side kick, BT (Big Tiny) and forgive me, but I am sick of seeing stories where black men are referred to by initials or off the freaking wall nicknames (T-Dog? The man never had a real name and then he died) and are fill in the blank stereotypes, \u201cbig, strong, but not all that smart\u201d. Actually BT was a little worse. He sort of drifted into the land of almost \u201cmagical negro\u201d. If he wasn\u2019t brooding and silent, he was cussing you to ribbons or spouting some spiritual mystical mumbo jumbo (the mumbo jumbo might be from the second book). He was like John Coffee from the Green Mile, only not all healy and whatnot.My biggest issue came when the main character, a veteran and ex-Marine(?) made a comment about Muslims. I think the term was \u201ctowel heads\u201d, but don\u2019t quote me. This is a slur. It is derogatory. Now I don\u2019t expect to like all of the characters that I read about. Some of them will be bigots. Some of them will be bad. Some of them will be misunderstood. I don\u2019t have to like them. In fact, I don\u2019t want to like them all. But bear in mind that I\u2019d just listened to Tuffo in an interview state that his protagonist was based on himself. So I started to ask myself questions.1.\tIs this Tufo calling Muslims/Arabs (I know they aren\u2019t the same but our media has effectively created a hybrid and the words are often interchangeable) \u201ctowel heads\u201d or is that the protagonist? I don\u2019t know the answer to that. It\u2019s hard to tell.2.\tIf this is Tufo using this slur, does it matter to me, the reader? Have I stopped reading other authors who have questionable politics or views? The answer to that is sometimes yes, and sometimes no. It depends.Nevertheless, I continued to listen to the story until its conclusion and I was moderately satisfied at the end. Not impressed. Sort of\u2026meh. I found ZF entertaining enough even though I didn\u2019t exactly think the book was the stuff of genius, or award worthy or deserving of the multiple five star accolades. To be totally honest, if I had been reading as opposed to listening, I likely would not have been able to complete it. The science is flawed, but heck, this is the ZA we\u2019re talking about. If one isn\u2019t willing to suspend disbelief at the door, then they shouldn\u2019t even begin reading this or any other zombie tale.I went on to begin listening to the second book. I never finished it because our protagonist made a statement about how all Muslims just hate Christians. I paused the audio on that and I think I even rewound that portion to listen to again. I started to ask myself those questions again. In the end, I couldn\u2019t go back to the story. I\u2019m not exactly Mrs. Politically Correct, but I am Muslim, and I was sufficiently insulted. And for that you don\u2019t get more of my time or my money.There has been lots of discussion lately on Goodreads about rating and reviews, about how they should be based on the merits of the book and not the author themselves. So over a month has passed wherein I have endeavored to rate this book justly. This is no easy task due mostly to the fact that I\u2019m not sure who/what I dislike. The author, or the character who is supposed to be the author, or both, the flawed science and its one dimensional female characters and BT the sage black side kick, the jackassery and idiotic jokes\u2026I give this one a two.

I read books in a wide variety of genre. I confess a preference for the paranormal and horror, so why have I not come across Mark Tufo\u2019s books before?Zombie Fallout is the first in a series and begins just after the plague starts. It is written in the form of a journal, which is narrated by the main character, Michael Talbot. Mike is forced to become the Man of the Hour when an untested H1N1 vaccine turns thousands into the walking dead. He\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s strong, he\u2019s a former Marine, he\u2019s got a good dose of common sense, and he has a sense of humor which helps in the sanity department. Being a touch paranoid, uh, I mean being a survivalist, he is prepared. He just never quite expected that he needed to be prepared for zombies, but he can adapt on the fly. Relying on his training and skills, Mike sets out to do whatever he can to save his family, friends, and as many of the still-living as possible.Along the way, Mike meets quite the variety of characters, both heroic and vile. His cause is aided in unexpected and sometimes unexplainable ways by those you\u2019d assume to be a liability rather than an asset. Ryan Seacrest lends a hand, in a unique way. People who could be of great help show their worst side, and choices have to be made. Somewhere along the line Mike also figures out that these zombies may be dead, but they\u2019re not quite brain dead. I found Mr. Tufo\u2019s writing style to be refreshingly \u201creal\u201d. By that I mean he writes the way ordinary people talk \u2013 at least how people with Michael Talbot\u2019s background would talk. Is the grammar and sentence structure perfect? No. Would your grammar and sentence structure be perfect if you were dodging zombies? Probably not. Mike\u2019s wife and sons make what I\u2019ll call \u201cguest appearances\u201d, taking over chapters when Mike is occupied elsewhere and unable to keep us up to speed on what\u2019s happening. These chapters are written in an obviously different style, which to me proves Mr. Tufo\u2019s intent. At any rate, Zombie Fallout is an easy read. Gory? Yes, but it wouldn\u2019t be a zombie story without some gore, right? It\u2019s ok though, the sense of humor throughout brings balance to the blood and guts.

I stuck with it in the hopes that it would get better.It didn't.The humor was juvenile (fart/poop jokes galore), OTT, mean-spirited at times (fat jokes...so many fat jokes) and downright homophobic** and sexist at others. And just simply not funny. At. All.Examples:\"My neighbor next door was a decent person in a bull-dykeish sort of way.\" Also, the character's name was Jo, but the main character, who was also narrating had a irksome way of writing her name as Jo(e?), as if he couldn't quite believe she wasn't actually a man. Not a good way to get me in your main character's corner.Fat jokes:\"My guess was the promise of food. These two didn't ever look like they passed up a chance at something to eat.\" (about two female zombies.)\"I didn't think anybody but the Man of Steel himself was going to be able to stop that bulk once it got into motion.\"...\"The odds were good that Justin and I were about to become human pancakes, sandwiched under the enormous bulk of Tommy.\"About Tommy...he's a kid who the book terms as 'a little slow', who also hears the voice of Ryan Seacrest (I kid you not) turning Tommy into a sort of prophet type character as Seacrest seems to know what's going to happen at any given moment. Oh...and he's fat. And he likes to eat. A lot. And he apparently can't eat anything without smearing it all over his face. And he's really fat. I'm not sure the book stressed enough just how fat and slovenly Tommy was. UGGGHHHHH *rolls eyes*Mysogyny:\"What the hell was wrong with me? I was having feelings, I had sobbed and now I was swooning, a couple more days of this crap and I was going to need some Tampax.\"Real winner, isn't he? Our narrator, ladies and gentlemen.And on that note, while exactly none of the characters had any depth, the female characters were flat out written horrendously. Every single one of them was shrewish, irritating, all but completely helpless, didn't appear to have a brain in their heads, and were constantly angry and yelling. The book took weird side tangents, e.g. a sidestory about the main character almost cheating on his wife, and a completely unecessary side story about a rapist/serial killer who had a female zombie chained in his basement to...well, I think you can suss out why.It was disjointed, clunky, unfunny, and...outside of Tommy and the two canine characters, I was rooting for the zombies.*When trying to decide to read a book or not, I usually read several (non-spoilery reviews) from each rating level. Apparently I didn't read the 'right' bad reviews. :\\**The homophobia was apparently worse in a earlier version of the book. While part way through the book, I stopped reading to come back on Goodreads to see if others disliked it as much as I did, and I came across a couple of reviews that commented on something the main character's wife (who also had a turn at narrating), said during a scene in which she and her daughter were in a convenience store on a cigarette run. The line was something to the effect of (the zombie's head being smashed) was as 'repellent as watching two guys kiss.' I had just read that scene prior, and did not recall anything that sounded like that, so I reread the scene again, and used my kindle's search to try to find it, and I could not. So, I'm assuming the book was revised at some point and that little comment was removed?"}, {"userName": "Greg at 2 Book Lovers Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26135818-greg-at-2-book-lovers-reviews", "userReview": "I am always somewhat excited and apprehensive when I pick up a new zombie book by an author I\u2019ve never read before. On the one hand, is it just going to be the same old, same old rehashing of what has been done before with some new window dressing? Or has the author taken the basic concept and \u201cmade it his own, dawg!\u201d With eight books in the Zombie Fallout series, my hopes were high. I was not disappointed.Mark Tufo has taken a slightly unorthodox approach in his presentation. The story takes on a bit of an unfiltered rambling, and first-person look back at the shit hitting the fan. This style really worked for me, I could really get a feel for who Michael Talbot is and I connected with the real life drama that was going on in the story.An important aspect of any outbreak book is the vector of the infection. Where did it start? How does it spread? Could this really happen? Do the zombies want a side of liver with their brains? Mark Tufo has taken a marvelous approach to this, using a real life virus that is still fresh in our minds. And he has given the zombies something a little more sinister than what the reader is accustomed to.Zombie Fallout has an impeccable balance between the drama and the terror of the zombies and the brash, slapstick humor of the character interactions and Michael\u2019s thoughts. This is not the type of book you want to read when you are looking for a very serious, depressing look at the end of the world, it is more Zombieland than 28 Days Later. Michael Talbot\u2019s thoughts range from shocking, to outrageous, to you did not just go there. It was a perfect fit for where I was when I picked it up.If you are looking for a light and fun trip through the end of the world, Zombie Fallout could be the perfect road trip."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10193172-daniel", "userReview": "I love me some zombies. And I always appreciate the hangman's humor in any \"The End of the World as we know it\" type of story as I am pretty sure that is how I would handle it.I really do like the narrative voice of the main character, Michael Talbot. As a military guy I can relate, and the really funny bit is that Mike is a zombie fan in the novel. So unlike some stories where apparently all the characters are dumbfounded that zombies exist, with no knowledge of the lore and stories that surround them (no modern novel should have character that are too shocked by zombies, they are too prevalent in US pop culture). Mike even experiences the moment of giddy, \"It's real! It is really happening\" before the reality hits him and it becomes \"It's real?!? It is really happening....... crap. We are screwed.\"Overall the story flows pretty well, from the initial outbreak (damn flu shots....) to the desperate battle to protect his family. It does introduce some likable or interesting characters, but given this is a zombie story do not get too attached to any of them. The author does decide to bring in a mystical capability on both one of the characters and on at least a few of the zombies that made some of the story a stretch, but overall it didn't hurt the story too much (though it made for a some convenient outs for the near terminal situations that author painted the characters into).Fun read, and also funny. Given the title it sounds like there may be some more story left from the remaining characters so I would be interested to see where this may go."}, {"userName": "Dan JK", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14305378-dan-jk", "userReview": "Upon reflection of different passages of this book i feel like it was written by a cowardly mindless and soul less junior high student who is constantly referred to as a homosexual by the bullies of his school and therefore uses his only outlet (writing) to direct hates peach toward different minorities and then hurredly shows what he wrote to the bullies to make them accept him into their asshole clic.At first I thought this book was well written and that it was using sarcasm and obvious metaphor to show things like the differences in societal acceptance through generations (ie the protagonist calling an old woman a racist and bigot, while he himself condones and utters homophobic jokes constantly). But as soon as the author used the protagonists wife to equate the vileness of a human skull getting smashed in with seeing two men kissing i realized there was nothing ironic intended about the writing and in fact this writer himself is a racist and a bigot.Do you remember how religions used to burn scientific books because they flat out proved random claims made my religions to be utterly false if not ridiculous? Well if the opposite were true and we burned things that were proven to be wrong or had no value like lets say bibles, then this shit pile would be at the top of the fire."}, {"userName": "Sarajane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7342545-sarajane", "userReview": "I'm not great at leaving reviews, but I have to try. This book was an amazing read. If you find it hard to read a book with grammatical errors or run on sentences or even paragraph long \"thoughts\" from the main character, is book is not for you. Unless of course, you are an avid zombie lover like myself. I loved how the author wrote this book. It's a refreshing change to the perfect writing of most authors. You can actually relate to the person. Mark Tufo writes, how most normal people think and talk. And add a little humor into it the mix, which he does gracefully, and you have a perfect zombie book!You follow a man and his family and friends as they fight to survive the zombie apocalypse...but these zombies are not your normal, everyday George Romero zombies, they have a self awareness, to an extent. A great entertaining read. I cannot wait to move onto the second book, which I am doing as soon as I finish this review.

It isn't horror, either, or funny, or well written. It does, however, have zombies in it.I was hoping for another good zombie series like Mira Grant's Newsfeed series. This is definitely NOT it. The characters were less than deep, the women even more stereotypical than others. The plot was choppy, with enough holes to drive Mr. Tufo's jeep through. The humor was of the Adam Sandler variety, so if you like that then it's got that going for it.I listened to the audio book version of this, because I have a long commute to work & back. The narrator was great, did a good job with what he had to work with. But just before the halfway mark I found myself fast forwarding thru the \"comedy\" and the absolutely unnecessary background info. However, I was hooked enough to listen to the end, and given some of the books I've tried listening to recently, that's saying something. That's why I rated it 2 stars instead of 1. Honestly, I've been looking for good zombie books like World War Z and the Newsfeed series.

Being a fan of \"The Walking Dead\" series and all things apocalyptic that includes zombies, I decided to give it a whirl! I was immediately enthralled with the book, the author writes with a great sense of humor but also has a way of describing everything the characters are going through that makes you feel like you are there and zombies are breathing down your neck! I have spent a few nights up until almost 2 in the morning reading to find out what happens next and in the process ended up scaring myself silly! So if a family, a bulldog and a Wal-Mart door greeter who hears the voice of Ryan Seacrest telling him what to do, mixed in with brain munching zombies are your thing, give this book a try!

The humor was well-placed and laugh out loud funny. The action was tense and effective, making this a quick, addicting listen. There is an interesting supernatural element that I don\u2019t yet understand, but maybe I\u2019ll learn more about in future books. He does an excellent job utilizing past tense to increase the tension for what is to come. The character relationships effectively created a reason to care for the ensuing horror. All in all I was very satisfied and looking forward to Book Two.My library had this as an audiobook download that is always available, maybe yours does too. If you have time to listen to audiobooks and enjoy a quick apocalypse, defend the camp zombie story, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy this one. Sean Runnette does a great job narrating.

There are too many good things wiping through my mind right now to even begin to know where to begin, lets see, okay, firsty there is Mike the main character, Marks style of writing has brought him to life i have added him to the list of people that if they were real i'd add to my dinner party invites, only if he brought henry though. In all seriousness though, mark has done what many other authors fail to do, he brings characters to life, he manages to juggle quite a respectable amount of characters and each one has been written well enough that i feel like i know them, im emotionally attached to them and they make me laugh. He keeps an eye on them all not letting them become props for the man character but real people with there own agenda and lives to lead, the plot is original and yes i know im taking about a zombie book, but read it i bet your zombie nightmares will be infused with a little extra terror. The stlye of writing is quick and easy to read rpoviding enough back story where needed and humour in all the right places. All the things i love in a book.

He lays out a plausible cause for the zombie epidemic that was probably very timely upon origin. The beauty is that it can withstand the test of time because of the seemingly never-ending stream of flu variants and inoculations that make the circuit. As for his characters, he has quite a cast and everybody will find an identifiable person that reminds them of an uncle or neighbor. This is definitely an \"every man\" zombie series...mostly. There are only a couple of moments that just seem to push things, but it does not detract.On the criticism side, sometimes the quips and the \"one liners\" got to be a bit much. Who cares if the car is being ruined when you are trying to stay alive. Mr. Tufo has a sense of humor if you have read or heard any of his interviews, but at times it broke the third wall and became just a bit distracting. There are some editing issues that I believe can and should be fixed--mostly in the dialog. Overall, this is an enjoyable read and will definitely entertain.

I had one or two good laugh out loud moments in the first chapter or two, but then the raunchy humor got old. It got old fast. If I was a pre-teen boy I might have enjoyed this book. There were plenty of poop, fart, and fat people jokes. The main character was excited about the idea of everyone in the world being wiped out by zombies. Not only that, but he was prepared for it. How convenient for him and his entire family. How is it that he was so prepared, but it took him 6 shots to even hit one of the zombies in the head? I do believe he said that he had his sons practice all the time at the shooting range. Did he skip these days too? I wanted a zombie book full of suspense, maybe a joke or two, this book did not deliver that. Usually I give every book 50% before I stop reading.

For several reasons.First of all the \"funny\" comments in the book was in my opinion not funny, and cringe-worthy in some cases. I was rolling my eyes at some parts. I lost count over how many times the smell of the zombies get mentioned (with various strange descriptions). I get it, they smell bad...All the women are described as being pretty much helpless, weepy and bossy.I found a lot of the comments from the main character to be sexist, homophobic and/or racist. Some examples:\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jo(e),\u201d I saidHis neighbour is a lesbian lady called Jo. Because she is a \"butch\" lesbian, every time the main character talks about her, her name is spelled Jo(e).What the hell was going on with me? I was having feelings, I had sobbed and now I was swooning, a couple more days of this crap and I was going to need some Tampax.Does he think that only women with PMS are allowed to have feelings?His face had swollen to almost double its proportion. If it had been caused by a bee sting, it would have been hilarious.Personally I don't really think that severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reactions are \"hilarious\"...I had never had a woman ever, EVER thank me for lying to her.

It started in a lab at the CDC (Center for Disease Control), virologists were so relieved to finally have an effective vaccination against the virulent swine flu. Pressure to come up with something had come from the highest office in the land. In an attempt at speed the virologists had made two mistakes, first they used a live virus and second they didn\u2019t properly test for side effects. Within days hundreds of thousands of vaccinations shipped across the US and the world. People lined up for the shots, like they were waiting in line for concert tickets. Fights broke out in drugstores as fearful throngs tried their best to get one of the limited shots. Within days the CDC knew something was wrong. Between 4 and 7 hours of receiving the shot roughly 95% succumbed to the active H1N1 virus in the vaccination. More unfortunate than the death of the infected was the added side effect of reanimation, it would be a decade before scientists were able to ascertain how that happened. The panic that followed couldn\u2019t be measured. Loved ones did what loved ones always do, they tried to comfort, their kids or their spouses or their siblings, but what came back was not human not even remotely. Those people that survived their first encounter with these monstrosities usually did not come through unscathed, if bitten they had fewer than 6 hours of humanity left, the clock was ticking. During the first few hysteria ridden days of The Coming as it has become known, many thought the virus was airborne, luckily that was not the case or nobody would have survived.
