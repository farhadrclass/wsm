(12), The Last Word and Other Stories (12) and Newly Collected (4). Rather, I found most of them arguably readable while some few fairly manageable. One of the reasons is that, I think, I couldn't fathom to deepen my better understanding due to the context itself of the story in question. Probably I would reread that with more information to clarify any ambiguity I might encounter.Coming to look at the bright side, I'd like to encourage Greene newcomers to have a try by reading any story that looks appealingly interesting because we can find \"Graham Greene in a range of contrasting moods, sometimes cynical and witty, sometimes searching and philosophical.\" (back cover) Eventually, we would soon find reading him so uniquely amazing and inspiring that we can't help wondering how he has done so fantastically. For instance, I found reading his \"May we borrow your husband?\" subtly humorous and critical from its 8 parts, 27-odd pages; the story depicting a newly-wed young couple (Peter and Poopy) who obviously look unhappy as observed by the narrator (William) and a duo of seemingly mischievous young men (Stephen and Tony) as social acquaintances who have gradually involved in their affair.This extract may give us some ideas on the ensuing conflict:Tony detected the smile. 'A regular body-snatcher,' he said. My breakfast and the young man arrived at the same moment before I had time to reply. As he passed the table I could feel the tension. 'Cuir de Russie,' Stephen said, quivering a nostril. 'A mistake of inexperience.' The youth caught the words as he went past and turned with an astonished look to see who had spoken, and they both smiled insolently back at him as though they really believed they had the power to take him over ... For the first time I felt disquiet. (pp. 308-309)We may wonder how come, in terms of such a roguishly humorous title, and it's a relief to find it in this extract: And then Stephen produced the master-plan. I could tell it was coming by the way his hands stiffened on his coffee-cup, by the way Tony lowered his eyes and appeared to be praying over his croissant. \"We were wondering, Poopy -- may we borrow your husband?\" I have never heard words spoken with more elaborate casualness. She laughed. She hadn't noticed a thing. 'Borrow my husband?' ... (p. 318)Eventually, it's a bit challenging for us as readers to guess in mind how the end would be and we would soon realize that Greene's ending is different from Maugham's in that he has left his readers to reflect further or judge it ourselves like this story."}, {"userName": "Martin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6364929-martin", "userReview": "As the book's title implies, it collects ALL of Graham Greene's short stories, so those other collections? like Twenty-one Stories, May We Borrow Your Husband & Other Comedies of the Sexual Life, The Last Word and Other Stories? Yep, they're all in here, along with some other stories, 4 of which are 'newly collected', for a grand total of 53 stories.For my impressions on the 3 individual short story collections mentioned above, I invite you to click on their respective links.Usually with short story collections, I find that I have to read only a few (stories) at a time - in between other books, let's say - so that the book doesn't become a chore and I don't find myself growing disinterested (or worse: bored!). Sometimes even that is insufficient and I still get bored. Such culprits include Thomas Mann's Collected Stories and Burton's The Arabian Nights. This may change, but right now I can't even go anywhere near these 2 books.There have been many happy (for me) exceptions to this rule, when the quality of the stories is so constantly good, that I read through the whole thing very fast. This book is a such an exception, and it joins a select club, whose exclusive membership include such gems as The Complete Stories of Evelyn Waugh, Boccaccio's The Decameron, Dashiell Hammett's Crime Stories and Other Writings, and Penguin's 4 short story collections of W. Somerset Maugham - oh, and Rudyard Kipling's Collected Stories.So it goes without saying that if you like short stories and/or Graham Greene, you should get this collection, because it is 'complete' and you will probably save yourself some $$ by buying one book instead of three.Okay, okay. Here are some of the stories that I enjoyed more than others:- Special Duties- When Greek Meets Greek - Alas, Poor Maling- Across The Bridge- The Basement Room- The End Of The Party- A Visit To Morin- Dream Of A Strange Land- May We Borrow Your Husband?- A Shocking Accident- Doctor Crombie- The Root Of All Evil- The Last Word- The News In English- A Branch Of The Service- The Blessing- Dear Dr Falkenheim* Excluding this sentence, the word 'stories' was used 11 times in this review, and 'story' was used 3 times.

In the foreword, Greene states that he can never achieve the level of story of \"The Lady with the Dog\" by Chekhov, and describes himself as a novelist who writes short stories instead of the other way around (like Chekhov).While not every one of the stories was as good as the first (in my collection) titled \"May We Borrow Your Husband?\", Greene masterfully, and honestly, connects with several top tier stories. \"The Destructors\" is marvelous, while \"I Spy\" which Greene considers his finest story in the collection, is heartbreaking. \"Under the Garden\" is also amazing. Reading his collection straight-up is like reading two Greenes. One is silly, jovial, and slap-stick, while the other is collegiate, serious, and vicious. Both Greenes are honest about the subject matter, although the first Greene (the one that writes 'entertainments') is less serious in his honesty and more flippant, perhaps, in a forgivable way.I recommend his complete collection to everyone who is in the mood for comedy, tragedy, and everything in-between. The story about the Canadian Santa Claus being decapitated (I shit you not) is laugh-out-loud funny."}, {"userName": "Mia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5594927-mia", "userReview": "I tend to prefer novels to short stories; for some reason I can't connect to characters in short stories as well as I might be able to in novels.

He is such a brilliant story teller, and not only are each of his stories different, they each have the ability to stand on their own. They're nothing like the stories I was forced to read in English last year!What I love about his writings in this book is the sincere, tender, and sometimes heartbreaking aspect of certain stories.

As almost any prose writer will tell you, its a skill that requires two entirely different sets of muscles.However, for the most part it seems that the only major muscles Graham Greene possessed were novel writing ones. They made him look pretty buff, granted, but I guess its like focusing your entire sports career on conditioning the running muscles and not the throwing ones. You'll still be able to throw stuff, but when you do try its going to make people wonder if its just easier to buy you a slingshot and save you some misery.But honestly I don't believe Greene is even known as a short story writer and not simply because his peaks as a novelist overshadow everything else. I bought this because I am apparently easily seduced by packages that market themselves as \"complete\", to the point where I'd probably eagerly purchase a \"Complete Set of Vengeful Assassins\" and that'll be that for me.This one collects basically all the stories that Greene wrote over the course of his career in one near six hundred page volume and one thing that will become clear is that six hundred pages of Greene's short fiction is perhaps more than you'll possibly need. All the elements that make his novels so interesting for me, namely the crushing sense of inevitability, the exotic settings seen through a reporter's eye, the examination of the religious and social themes, seem to work better when played out over the course of several hundred pages instead of ten. Reduced to a shorter format, most of the stories, especially the early ones, appear to act more like sketches or scenes searching for a novel. Most of them set up a scenario and let it play through briefly before ending on some kind of chilling twist. This does make them effective in surts but its like having nothing but chewy snacks instead of a full meal.What's interesting is how early on he seemed to be trying out different genres, with a couple stories either hinting at spiritual or otherworldly elements or simply doing their best to be outright creepy. Even more intriguing is a couple stories that fell into the \"A Sense of Reality\" collection (namely \"A Discovery in the Woods\" and \"Under the Garden\") that swerve very close to a peculiar version of fantasy that you almost wish he could have developed further, if only for the novelty of seeing what else he could do with it.But for the most part you get fairly standard Greene concerns (not religion, oddly enough, even if Catholicism is referenced a few times it seems he saved the heavy explorations for the novels themselves) so you have spouses cheating on each other (often the best ones, like \"May We Borrow Your Husband\", where a man falls in a love with a lady whose husband is being seduced by two other men, \"Cheap in August\", which has the lived in and grimy room feel of his good stuff, and \"Two Gentle People\", which manages to avoid being manipulative by a very small margin and thus works), stories set briefly in other territories (but without that heavy sense of place the novels manage), a smattering of tales involving spies or dictators or revolutionaries, but all of them functioning as a kind of Greene-lite, showing you what he can do without really delving into the meat of it.Are any of them bad? Actually, no. Greene is still Greene is still Greene so his prose remains clear-eyed and even when the plot isn't exactly crackling with drama he's pretty good at telling a story. Sometimes he's too clever for his own good and clarity becomes somewhat of an issue, but when he's good in small doses you almost wish he had worked as hard as he did on the novels. But when you have novels as good as \"The Heart of the Matter\", \"Brighton Rock\", and \"The Power and the Glory\" it seems selfish to demand that he write iconic short stories as well. Completists will certainly want to take a long, especially for the roads not traveled but everyone else will probably be happy with the longer works."}, {"userName": "Connor Rystedt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42929121-connor-rystedt", "userReview": "This will be my first review\u2014when I say review here, I now and forever mean my rambling reminiscence on my reading experience, hastily organized\u2014of a short story collection, which is nice because this is probably the best collection of short stories I've ever read. (I will say that I have a published review of Ethan Rutherford's The Peripatetic Coffin in the ARCC Campus Eye, so I do have some experience in the matter, though this will be something else entirely.) I've yet to do serious research on the life of Graham Green, though from what I've uncovered surfing the web, as well as from reading his Collected Short Stories and previously The Quiet American, I've discovered a few things. First of all, the man had a plethora of knowledge about the world that he lived in, as well as being extremely well traveled. It seems he also had an eerie prescience in certain situations, which reflects on his perceptiveness of humans on an individual and cultural level. Greene was also something of an enigma, seeing how he came to Catholicism in early adult life after meeting his soon-to-be wife, whom he would later become estranged from, as well as from religious practice altogether. These traits all shine through in this collection, which features work from four decades of the twentieth century. \tI became aware of Graham Greene a long time ago\u2014at least, what feels like a long time for someone who took their first legal drink just one week prior to this writing. It was late in the year of 2008, November or December, and Graham Greene had been dead for nearly two decades. A cute girl who sat behind me in Spanish class told me about a little-known independent film with a cult following called Donnie Darko. While I'm hesitant to start the explaining the abstract plot of the 2001 film starring Jake Gyllenhall, I will say that it is my favorite film to this day, and that I've seen it many, many times. A majority of the film takes place in a private school, where an English teacher (played by Drew Barrymore) is at odds with the school administration and a fanatically religious dance coach. The catalyst of this tension is Barrymore's sharing with the class the work of Graham Greene, particularly his short story \"The Destructors.\"\tThis reference would lead me\u2014years later, after I'd discovered my avid love for literature\u2014to my searching for a collection of Greene's short stories. At Magers and Quinn in Uptown Minneapolis, I found The Quiet American, though no collection of short stories. Though I'm not usually one for war or espionage novels, which lead to my shelving Greene's novel still unread for some time, I thoroughly enjoyed it upon completion and assured myself that I would return to Greene's work at some later date. It was earlier this month when I saw The End of the Tour, the film about David Foster Wallace, that I returned to the bookstore in Uptown. (The film was a limited release, and I dragged my brother to the theater on Hennepin Avenue to see it.) The store's stock on Graham Greene's work was much more abundant this time around, and I found the collection that I'd initially searched for. And although my watching movies is a rare thing these days with my large reading agenda, film is where I found my love for storytelling, and I will always have the softest of spots in my heart for Donnie Darko. This led me, with so many other new and unread books on my bedside table, to turn immediately to Greene. \tWhat makes Greene's stories so profound is that he is able to unearth the mystifying truths of the human condition from a large overtone of realism. Collected Short Stories opens with \"The Destructors,\" and while it was good to finally have read the story that influenced so greatly my favorite movie of all time\u2014the framed movie poster hangs over my bed to this day\u2014it was nothing compared to the treasure trove that awaited me in the next 300+ pages. The plots all vary in terms of extravagance, ranging from dissatisfied marriages to immortal people living secretly beneath the roots of an oak tree, but it's a rare exception when one of the stories couldn't be deemed realistic. The mystical never seems to undermine the reality of these stories, and the effect is his ability to shock readers and to fill them with a sense of sadness and foreboding. Adverse to that point, I was also at times made to feel hope, yearning, and love.\t The topics and themes vary too. Many of the stories have strong religious overtones, where the faithful can either come off as wistful and charismatic, or instead as ignorant and prideful. One may think of Greene as a man of strong faith at end of one story, and then as a hopeless cynic at the next. Regardless of how the characters may appear, and how that may reflect on the state of their faith, the characters always seem dynamic, like living and breathing people. Their problems have a depth and darkness that the average reader might not expect out of literature from this early in the twentieth century. I was surprised to find Greene elaborate so clearly and openly about things like evil, suicide, infidelity and homosexuality, to uphold and to build upon ideas that I see as progressive in today's age. He writes evocatively and convincingly of human being's pursuit of morality, and our search for purpose; of the relationships between sexes, between families, between nations; of the self-consciousness inflicted upon us by minds, or even madness. I found many times while reading this collection\u2014as I did upon reading The Quiet American\u2014that there were numerous passages where an idea or image affected me in a way that no other author has been able to do, excerpts that I could write down as a quote and read it over when it feels I'm in a lull and looking for enlightenment. That sounds like a banal platitude (to use a very Wallace-esque phrase), but I'm struggling to meaningfully explain the impact his sentences and paragraphs have had on me. So concise and clear, yet so deep and revelatory; the only phrase I can think of to explain these excerpts and passages that are so approachable and quotable is this: fuckin' perfect. \tThe book consists of three separate short story collections, one from the late '40s and the other two being published in the '60s, but some of the earliest stories are dated from around the time of the Great Depression. Greene traveled often in his life\u2014even to the most exotic places\u2014so while most of his stories take place in England, the setting is also subject to change. There are historical references throughout, names and events that might have been important to the understanding of the story that I readers may be uneducated about. The Battle of Britain, for instance, is taking place during one of the earlier stories in the collection, so reader's who aren't versed in WWII history may be confused as to why there are planes dropping bombs on the city. Despite all this\u2014the stories being old, their being set in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar customs, with outdated technologies and ways of life\u2014this collection has spoken to me of the human condition and some of our most searching questions in a way that I've never before encountered. \tI've heard\u2014or rather, read\u2014it said that Graham Greene is the greatest novelist of the 20th century. Seeing how I've only read one of his novels (and one considered not a novel, but an 'entertainment' by Greene's own standards), I can't speak on that matter. I can say that the one novel of his that I've read had sparked a great interest in me, that this collection of short stories has solidified him as one of my favorite writers, and that I'm now in the pursuit of discovering whether or not that statement rings with truth. I would recommend to anyone \"A Discovery in the Woods,\" about a gang of children committing a forbidden act and crossing the boundaries of their crude village. Shockingly sad, beautifully written, and with a great twist at the end, it's one of the many exemplifications of Greene's mastery of the short-story form. If his novels sustain the quality found in his Collected Short Stories, I imagine I'll be one to back up those who label Greene as the greatest."}, {"userName": "Doctor Moss", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss", "userReview": "This collection of short stories spans Graham Greene's career, from the 1920s to 1990. Many pick up on the same themes prevalent in his novels, especially the experience of World War II in Britain, life in Africa, Mexico, and the non-western world, and, to a lesser extent, the struggle of the reflective person with faith.I hadn't read much of Greene's short fiction, and this gave me a chance to see a different side of him. Short stories give him a chance to focus tightly on particular personality traits or particular tensions -- it's something I think he's really good at. This is the kind of fiction that makes you think as well as entertains.There were a few surprises for me in this collection. In particular, the short story, Under the Ground, presented a kind of disquieting surreal experience -- something I wasn't used to from Greene's novels, which tend to live in noirish themes or in the tension of political or religious faith. It turns out that that story is part of a collection with a running surreal theme, something I hadn't seen in his novels.The quality of the stories run from the finely finished to the sketchy, but that's okay.

Who has the right, except someone like George Orwell? A highly prolific novelist and writer in several genres, Greene was widely renowned for his work and even nominated for the Nobel. Getting into criticism of an author who almost achieves 'classic' status seems the wrong kind of vanity.I don't like Graham Greene. I don't like him as a person. He strikes me as the sort you couldn't ever be close to because his Roman Catholic bigotry would always get in the way, and I say that as a Catholic myself. You could perhaps say the same about Evelyn Waugh, but somehow I rather feel I'd have liked Waugh. Something about his sense of the absurd combined with his humor. Waugh wrote fairly serious stuff, but he also wrote things like 'Scoop,' which is hilarious.Greene does rise to the level of the amusing, and his tales are well structured and paced (immaculately so sometimes). But his primary aim in fiction, it seems, is to be vicious. He wants to convey the sense that anyone who does not embrace the idea of a consecrated Catholic communion wafer being the only salvation for the misery of the human condition is hopeless, and deserves to live in misery forever. It's a spiteful and annoyingly superstitious attitude that simply doesn't sit well with me. Greene used to say something to the effect that anything about him that was worth anything was in his writing, and that the rest of it was 'just life,' or something like that. He didn't want anyone paying attention to his personal life. He only wanted appreciation as an artist. Yet I can't forget what I know about Greene as a person when I'm reading him. He was a swine, by most accounts, and enjoyed inflicting psychological torture on his wife by bringing women home to their house and having his way with them there while Mrs. Greene was there. He was supposedly separated from his wife for the last 63 years of his life, yet of course he couldn't divorce her. It would have prevented him from receiving the wafer at Mass.Nevertheless, his short stories are extremely well constructed, as anyone bothering to plow through this lot would agree. Some of the 53 stories in this collection are even extremely memorable, and have been made into screen productions for TV or cinema. 'Across the Bridge' (with Rod Steiger) and 'The Basement Room' (with Ralph Richardson) spring to mind, but there was also a British TV series called 'Shades of Greene' (1975-76) that featured many of the stories in this collection. I remember seeing one of these dramatized for TV (The Destructors) as a boy, and I never forgot it. Greene could turn a phrase, and many of these stories are brilliant in their way. Some are terrible, but they're in the minority. Sadly, even the good ones have that kind of smug sanctimony about them, as if the main characters are all doomed because they haven't yet grasped the essential, critical value of embracing salvation as embodied in his own sect. Once you've done that, you can be as hypocritical as you like for the rest of your life. If you don't, all your efforts to be good are in vain.Here is a classic quotation from the book, which appears at the end of the story 'Across the Bridge.' As such, it contains a SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER! So if you can't hack it, leave now. It's in the last paragraphs, and goes like this:'It all seemed to me a little too touching to be true as the old crook lay there with his arm over the dog's neck, dead with his million between the money changers' huts, but it's as well to be humble in the face of human nature. He had come across the river for something, and it may, after all, have been the dog he was looking for. It sat there, baying its stupid and mongrel triumph across his body, like a piece of sentimental statuary: the nearest he could get to the fields, the ditches, the horizon of his home. It was comic and it was pitiable, but it wasn't less comic because the man was dead. Death doesn't change comedy to tragedy, and if that last gesture was one of affection, it was only one more indication of a human being's capacity for self-deception, our baseless optimism that is so much more appalling than our despair.'So baseless optimism is 'appalling,' more so than desperation. As I said, it's spiteful, and it ridicules people generally as pathetic. That is Greene's way. If you can deal with it, keep going with it. But it's a fairly ghastly attitude in all, and I suspect it does nothing to improve the human condition in a way. Stories like 'May We Borrow Your Husband?' and 'Cheap In August' are quite simply brilliant in their way (iconic even), but damned if they don't leave a rancid taste in one's mouth. 4 stars for sheer ability."}, {"userName": "Gabriel Valjan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11940358-gabriel-valjan", "userReview": "\u201cIt was the biggest protest he had ever allowed himself to make against the condition of life.\u201dGraham Greene. \u201cTwo Gentle People.\u201d Complete Short Stories. p.427.Ah, \u2018the condition of life\u2019 is a phrase apt to sum up Graham Greene\u2019s literary output. \u201cTwo Gentle People\u201d is not the best or most exciting story in the Penguin volume, but it demonstrates all of the hallmarks of Greene\u2019s narrative strength: what is said is not said, with the reader as implicated witness; the unintentional slip of speech that betrays one character to another or, the character to the reader; and the often indeterminate and inconclusive ending to a Greene \u2018entertainment,\u2019 or novel.Two middle-aged people, a French woman and a British man, meet and share a park bench. They each have their separate life and each is polite and civilized. They strike up a superficial conversation. A pigeon is injured; falls down, its injury fatal. The man, out of compassion, kills the bird and respectfully disposes of the body. The woman observes and admires him. There is brief moment of silence after the act of violence. They resume their conversation. They get on well. He invites her to lunch. They have lunch at a brasserie. Attraction, as mutual admiration but not lust, bubbles up through the text. He offers to walk her home. She declines. They talk some more after their meal. She uses the intimate tu pronoun form instead of the formal vous form in her French with him when her speech lapses momentarily. Is it a slip? She catches herself. He says nothing and they part.The story seems almost genteel reportage \u2013 a story about nothing -- until both characters return home. She hears her husband with the \u2018boys.\u2019 She is well off. As she takes off her jewelry, every object she removes and every object on her vanity reminds her of the sexless liaison that afternoon. Is she cheating because the reader knows she had contemplated it for a moment? The man returns home and his wife \u2013 named Patience \u2013 says, \u2018I can smell a woman on you.\u2019 He is late coming home and she thinks that he has been out womanizing at the Rue de Douai. Has he had mistresses before? Does she know her husband better than we, the reader, have come to know him? Is he to be trusted?Greene\u2019s writes horror on par with Stephen King in \u201cA Discovery In The Woods.\u201d It is that creepy. \u201cI Spy\u201d and \u201cThe End of the Party\u201d are stories from a child\u2019s point of view. \u201cDoctor Crombie\u201d is one of his humorous stories: all those who have died from cancer have also had had sex so therefore sex might be the cause of cancer. His short story \u201cThe Destructors\u201d is his novel Brighton Rock (1947) in miniature.Greene, like his friend Kim Philby, remains elusive and evasive. His prose style is lean by comparison to British authors in his day. Not quite Hammett but it is lean and nuance. Greene is a master of the subjunctive mood. The themes in his novel are what will make his writing durable. As to the man himself, I think the best answer or insight comes from E.M Forester's essay \"What I Believe\" which appeared in The Nation in 1938. He states:\u201cIf I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159477-steven", "userReview": "\u201cThe Destructors\u201d is one of my ur stories: a story that made me want to write stories, a story that I reread frequently to reconnect with what stories are all about. It\u2019s one of those stories that can have an immediate impact: a gang of kids destroying an old miser\u2019s house. Yet on repeated readings the story gains in power because it works on so many levels. Old Misery locked in the loo; the Christopher Wren (builder of St Pauls and the house, both of which were among the few buildings in that area that survived the Blitz) reference; the leadership struggle among the gang of kids; Trevor (the upper class name) being called T, until it is a dig; the burning of the money; the truck driver laughing after the house is pulled down; those are just some of the subtleties woven through the primary action of the inside-out dismantling of the house. And then there\u2019s this scene:\u2019Did you find anything special?\u2019 Blackie asked. T nodded. \u2018Come over here,\u2019 he said, \u2018and look.\u2019 Out of both pockets he drew bundles of pound notes. \u2018Old Misery\u2019s savings,\u2019 he said. \u2018Mike ripped out the mattress, but he missed them.\u2019 \u2018What are you going to do? Share them?\u201d \u2018We aren\u2019t thieves,\u2019 T said. \u2018Nobody\u2019s going to steal anything from this house. I kept these for you and me - a celebration.\u2019 He knelt down on the floor and counted them out - there were seventy in all. \u2018We\u2019ll burn them,\u2019 he said, \u2018one by one\u2019 and taking it in turns they held a note upwards and lit the top corner, so that the flame burnt slowly towards their fingers. The grey ash floated above them and fell on their heads like age. \u2018I\u2019d like to see Ol Misery\u2019s face when we are through,\u2019 T said. \u2018You hate him a lot?\u2019 Black asked. \u2018Of course I don't hate him,\u2019 T said. \u2018There\u2019d be no fun if I hated him.\u2019 The last burning note illuminated his brooding face. \u2018All this hate and love,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s soft, it\u2019s hooey. There\u2019s only things, Blackie,\u2019 and he looked round the room crowded with unfamiliar shadows of half things, broken things, former things. \u2018I\u2019ll race you home, Blackie,\u2019 he said.\"Of course I don't hate him\" Wow.

The other two collections included are A Sense of Reality and May We Borrow Your Husband (And Other Comedies of the Sexual Life). I think the \u201cThe Destructors\u201d, a story of heartless vandalization for the sake of it, was one of the standouts in the first collection. But I also enjoyed \u201cThe Blue Film\u201d, a story of a youthful indiscretion that turns up to bring a sense of longing for something lost long ago by the protagonist. \u201cA Chance For Mr. Lever\u201d was also an interesting story of desperation and disaster in the wilds of Africa. It was obviously inspired by Greene\u2019s own travels in Liberia, recounted in this excellent book, Journey Without Maps. I do have to say that I didn\u2019t really care for the parable-like stories in A Sense of Reality, but found the stories in may We Borrow Your Husband among the best in the collection. I especially found the title story of a doomed marriage that unfolds in front of a worldly writer well executed. \u201cCheap In August\u201d, about an unlikely affair, was also a standout.

Glad he was as prolific on that front and so many more to sample in future. I suspect by the time I get around I will find it all new again. Which reminds me (short stories and all) to look into Maupessant again, after well over a quarter century.

He certainly can tell a good story and this collection has it all. I love how this collection binds together Greene's four collections in their original order, adding on a few unpublished stories at the end. When an author collects stories together there is a larger meaning that arises than that of the individual components. If you just jam all an author's stories together all randomly you lose that larger meaning. This book, however, presents the larger perspective that is the scope of Greene's entire short work while still preserving the vision of those individual collections.

I have always enjoyed reading Greene's novels but as the saying goes being a great novelist doesn't mean you can write good short stories. Obviously a different discipline.What annoyed me about the stories was the fact that only a couple had decent endings. For me the best short stories are those that surprise you and/or have a neat twist at the end that you wouldn't expect. Not these dull tomes. I struggled through most of them hoping that the end would be well worth the journey but it didn't happen.
