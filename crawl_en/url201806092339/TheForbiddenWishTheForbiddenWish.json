The question is, are you willing to gamble? How much are you willing to lose? What are you willing to risk everything for?\u201d\nI had a lot of doubts going into The Forbidden Wish. Yet another YA retelling? Yet another YA romance? But I should never have doubted my trusted Goodreads friends because there is nothing typical about this book.Firstly, it is very romancey. Let's get that out of the way. Normally I don't like my books so heavily romantic, but maybe that's just because they are so seldom done well and generally sacrifice character development and plot for sweet nothings. Maybe it's because, in my opinion, the best romances are the ones in books that are not really about romance at all. You see, I never felt like the ultimate purpose of this story was to get Zahra and Aladdin together but, maybe as a result of that, I ended up wanting it anyway.Now let's break down all the great things about this book.The writing is so gorgeous it literally gave me goosebumps. Khoury describes this world of deserts, palaces and magic in lavish, beautiful detail. Rarely do authors paint pictures of their setting so well. I could picture it exactly and even feel the sense of magic in the air. A truly evocative use of words.Girl power. You know this story, right? At the very least, we've probably all seen the Disney version. It's the one about a street thief-turned-prince, a clueless sultan, an evil vizier, a male genie, and a humorous parrot (also male). There is a woman in the movie, and she's... won by the street thief-turned-prince who \"shows her the world\". Even this watered down 1992 version isn't exactly what you'd call feminist.The Forbidden Wish, however, is. For one, the jinni is female - a powerful, smart and badass jinni who takes shit from nobody, but is still flawed, lonely and sad. The princess is feisty and strong-minded, as is her band of tough girlfriends who are also great warriors. And, best of all, these girls are not enemies. They grow in strength when they come together and support one another. No petty slut-shaming or woman-hating. From the jinni to the mortal women, there is a mutual respect and admiration. So many authors could learn from this book.Then there's the romance. I honestly enjoyed it, even though I didn't start shipping until about halfway through. Aladdin is likable, probably made even more so by his weaknesses for alcohol and petty crime. He's imperfect, boyish, and an impossible flirt, but these qualities are really quite adorable. Also: absolutely no instalove.And we also have the story outside the romance. It's an old tale of powerful jinn, wishes that should never be spoken, and the worst mistake a jinni can ever make. It takes place in both the past and the present, unveiling Zahra's story at the same time as she fights for her freedom in the present. Can she ever win her freedom? And what price will she have to pay for it?I especially loved the way Zahra narrates the story, constantly addressing \"Habiba\", whose story is gradually revealed over the course of the novel. It adds another layer, and leaves us with some final touching moments.Such a strong, incredible novel. I have to warn you unromantics about the heavy romantic element, and yet it feels a shame to label this complex and powerful story a \"romance\". It's so many other things too.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "I am not allowed to hope. I am forbidden a wish of my own. And so I will not think of the world above, of the open sky, of the fresh air and the light of day.I will be lost, a myth, a dream. Trapped forever with myself in this prison of sand and magic. I cannot imagine a more terrifying doom. I thought I had resigned myself to this fate long ago, when it seemed no one would ever find me. Now I know this to be untrue, and that hope has pulsed deep within me like a dormant seed, waiting to flourish at the first sign of escape.\nHoly smokes, this was great!This book is a retelling of Aladdin in which the genie is a girl. To be honest, there is very little resembling Aladdin here, with the exception of the genie and Aladdin himself. Despite that, I found myself greatly enjoying thsi book. There's romance, yes, but I did not find it overwhelming. There's also incredibly vivid writing, really, the writing is awesome, there's unexpected moments of humor...\n\u201cYou\u2019re a\u2014you\u2019re a\u2014\u201dSay it, boy. Demon of fire. Monster of smoke. Devil of sand and ash. Servant of Nardukha, Daughter of Ambadya, the Nameless, the Faceless, the Limitless. Slave of the Lamp. Jinni.\u201c. . . a girl!\u201d he finishes.For a second, I can only blink at him\nHeehee. And the genie herself is pretty bad-ass.Zahra is a jinni. She has been trapped in the desert sands for 500 years, desolate, alone, and haunted by past memories of her last master. Zahra has almost lost hope of seeing the outside world again, when a boy named Aladdin appears and summons her from the lamp. They're not exactly friends from the start.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the stories,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the songs. They call you the Fair Betrayer, who enchanted humans with your . . .\u201d He pauses to swallow. \u201cYour beauty. You promised them everything, and then you ruined them.\u201dA thousand and one replies vie for my tongue, but I swallow them all, bury them deep, deep in my smoky heart. Letting out a long breath, I shrug one shoulder. \u201cSo what now? Will you toss me away? Bury me again?\u201dHe laughs, a cold, sharp laugh. \u201cThrow you away? When you can grant me three wishes? Would I throw away a bag of gold just because I found it in a pile of dung?\u201d\nThat's where the similarities to Aladdin ends.I really liked Zahra. She is powerful, but vulnerable. From the beginning, we know she suffers with regret over a girl, a \"sister.\" Over the course of the book, we uncover her story; Zahra constantly remembers this \"Habiba,\" addressing her directly in her memories, and it's a constant guessing game as to what transpired that haunts her so much, that fills her with so much sorrow. I found her actions realistic. She may be powerful, but she is still trapped by who she is. Zahra cannot go far from Aladdin without suffering greatly, bound by her curse. The whole \"betraying Aladdin and gaining her freedom\" thing isn't the stupid romance-centric excuse it seems. Her reasons for hesitation is quite valid, and her feelings towards freedom is complex.\nFor the first time I think about what comes after I win my freedom. For so long that\u2019s been my single goal, but what happens next? Do I return to Ambadya, where they hate me? Do I stay in the human world, where they would destroy me if they knew what I was? I have nowhere to go to and no one to spend my freedom with, and for the first time I begin to wonder if that\u2019s really freedom at all, or if I\u2019m exchanging one prison for another.\nAladdin is no longer a Disney prince. He is a charmer, at times a drunkard. He burns for revenge, yet is aware of his own weakness in obtaining it. He charms everyone with a vagina, and is an inveterate flirt. Yet I never found myself hating him. He's not an asshole. He's just who he is. \n\u201cZahra, if I wished for someone to die, could you do it?\u201dOutwardly, I am stone, but inside I rock like a stormy sea. I loathe this wish more than almost any other. It is cruel and cowardly, and I reevaluate this boy thief. There is a darkness in him I hadn\u2019t seen. \nI also liked the fact that there are other female characters in this book! Such a thing is a rarity in YA fiction. This book can be confusing. There are a lot of names to keep track of, and I wish that Zahra had more strength in her, but overall, this was a highly enjoyable book.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "4 1/2 stars.My, my, what an enchanting retelling of Aladdin brimming with magic, humour, villains and good kissing!\n\u2018\u2018Give me thy hand,\u2019\u2019 said the Queen, \u2018\u2018and let us be friends. For does not the poet say, one true-hearted friend is worth ten thousand camels laden with gold?\u2019\u2019\n\nThis the Jinni pondered, before replying, \u2018\u2018The poet also says, woe to the man who befriends the jinn, for he shakes hands with death.\u2019\u2019\nZahra is a jinni. For thousands of years, she has granted wishes. Freedom is something she knows is impossible, but that doesn\u2019t keep her from trying to break her curse and quit being a slave. When Aladdin finds Zahra, she is given a choice: betray him and forever be free of the lamp, or let his city, Parthenia, fall to ruins and everyone inside it die.Is that really a choice?I\u2019ve read thousands of books, and I\u2019ve met thousands of characters, but I can easily say that Zahra is a new favourite heroine of mine. She stands out. It\u2019s not her beauty that makes her special, or her hidden kindness, but her determination. She believes herself to be a monster; after all, she did kill her most trusted friend, Habiba. Zahra puts on a hard and sturdy mask, but deep inside herself, she is not a four-thousand-year-old magical creature of nightmares, she\u2019s just\u2026 a\u2026 a girl. With unreachable hopes and dreams.\nThe desert ripples, throwing the boy onto his back. I shift to human form and stand beside him, staring at the ground that held me captive for centuries. When the dust clears, there is nothing but a glinting blue stretch of sand, pure and virgin, coursed with wind ripples. The only evidence that there ever was a garden of wonders, the only testimony to the great city lost beneath the sand, is a single pale coin that lies on the surface, winking at the moon.And, of course, there is me.\nThere is forbidden love. There is adventure. There is betrayal. It\u2019s one of the best fairy tale retellings I have ever read. Aladdin retellings are quite rare; in the minority. The last one I perused is called A Whole New World and, if we compare its greatness to this one, The Forbidden Wish would be the sand and A Whole New World a plain and small rock buried by it. I loved this book.We know of cases of beautiful covers/bad books, but I\u2019m so relieved to say that this retelling never, at any point of the story, falls into that category.\n\u2018\u2018Even a thief may have honor, and even a jinni may have a heart.\u2019\u2019\nThe only thing that keeps me from giving it a five-star rating is the stalling. There are days and days of stalling at the beginning of the book, when Aladdin and Zahra enter the palace and are waiting for the Fahradan celebration day.Regardless, this is a winner.\n\u2018\u2018Love is a path lined with roses,\u2019\u2019 I say bitterly. \u2018\u2018But it leads to a cliff\u2019s edge, and all who follow it tumble to their doom.

This is one beautifully written fairy tale retelling. Imagine the story of Aladdin. Now change the sex of the jinni who serves him, add in some supernatural politics, some courtly intrigue, a handful of badass female warriors, two peoples on the brink of war, and you basically have this book in a nutshell. Was it perfect? No. I definitely had some issues with it. But now that I've finished it and am staring down at my notes, I can honestly say that I don't even want to get into them, because, in the end, they took very little away from my overall enjoyment of this. And doesn't that say everything? In short: this is a stunningly written, highly captivating, intoxicating blend of romance, mysticism, adventure, and intrigue. I highly suggest it for anyone in the mood for a YA fairy tale retelling.

When Zahra first came to me, demanding that her side of the story be told, I was immediately entranced. I think the genie is the most fascinating character of the Aladdin fairytale. But what if the genie were a girl? What if there were more to her story? These questions became my obsession, and Zahra's voice was so strong in my mind that often, while working on other books over the past few years, I would sneak away to write a few pages just for her. She was a character who simply refused to be ignored, and I'm so glad she didn't give up on me!The stories of Aladdin and the Thousand and One Nights have always been some of my favorites. Plus, my grandfather has been begging me for years to write a story inspired by his homeland, so Papa--this one is for you! I have immensely enjoyed writing this book and reliving the story of Aladdin through Zahra's eyes, and I hope you will love reading it as much as I did writing it.

I honestly couldn\u2019t find one thing I didn\u2019t love about it or one reason why I shouldn\u2019t give this book 4.5 stars ! So here it is : 4.5 amazing stars !\nThe story : \nWe\u2019re following Zahra, a very old and powerful Jinni who\u2019s been stuck in her lamp for thousands of years. But one day, a thief called Aladdin is going to find her lamp and release her from its walls, becoming her new master with 3 wishes at his disposal. What Zahra didn\u2019t expect was to find herself slowly caring for the boy despite her goal to reach her freedom at all costs and not repeat the past by angering the King of the Jinn who could destroy humans and their world. \n\n\u201cI have no form,\u201d I say, my voice shifting and multiplying, a dozen voices speaking at once. \u201cI have no name. I am the Slave of the Lamp, and your will is my will. Your wishes are my commands.\u201d\n\n\nThe world-building and plot :\nHonestly, I was completely bewitched and captivated by the whole concept of the book : the Jinn, or more precisely the retelling of Aladdin. I found it to be really unique, unlike any other fantasy book I\u2019ve read, and the writing, which I HAD to notice because of how beautiful, enchanting and dreamy it was, made the whole thing come alive in my hands, putting sparks and stars in my eyes, and it made it so easy to picture things such as the city, the outfits, but most of all the Jinn and their magic. The world was very well thought-out and original, intricate but not overly confusing with unnecessary details and complex concepts regarding the fantasy elements of the story. The intrigue was very fast-paced, once again the writing making it so easy to be hooked even when there\u2019s not much action, but the story was still full of adventure and feelings, and the last quarter of the book was truly badass and full of magic, it blew my mind. I also loved that the girls were the highlight in this book, all of them being badass, smart and brave : it was full-on girl power !\n\nSometimes, you can\u2019t choose what happens to you, but you can choose who you become because of it.\n\n\nThe characters : \nFirst, we have our Jinni : Zahra ! I don\u2019t know how, but it seems lately I\u2019m only reading books where I find the female lead to be extremely lovable, and Zahra was no exception ! Despite looking like a sixteen-year old girl, Zahra is actually thousands of years old, making her very mature, reasonable, smart, strong, a bit guarded because of a hurtful past, but through her adventures with Aladdin, she\u2019s going to learn to become more human again, letting her feelings fill her and accepting them, getting lighter and discovering how to have fun with him. I loved how despite being one of the last powerful jinn, I didn\u2019t feel the special snow-flake vibe from her : she felt more like a very important side-kick character and it was really refreshing. As for Aladdin, he completely charmed me ! He is cocky and a bit of a charmer , he\u2019s reckless and impetuous, yet he\u2019s also sweet, brave, faithful, loving, joking a lot and most of the times with a grin on his face. He\u2019s the kind of easy-going guy you can\u2019t help but love, but he\u2019s also haunted by his past and set on getting his revenge for his parents. I liked how he showed Zahra to enjoy life and helped her see that loving a human again is not wrong. Caspida was also a very strong and badass character, I loved her and her girls, how they fight for their people, how clever they were. This book was just full of amazing girls taking control of their lives and not letting themselves be enslaved by duty or men, they\u2019re being their own hero, THAT\u2019s the spirit ! \n\n\u201cThe things that were once sweet to me are now bitter. The sun is not half so bright. The stars seem dimmer. All this wealth and luxury feels meaningless. All the world is in your shadow, Zahra. I cannot help but see you when I close my eyes.\u201d\n\n\nThe romance : \nIt was quite important in the story, however it never overshadowed the world-building or the plot. It was a slow-burn romance, no insta-love, Zahra and Aladdin spending time together and getting to know the other one. I liked how for a while we could think it would follow the original story, with Aladdin being charmed by Caspida, but how ultimately the only girl he could see was Zahra. Their relationship felt natural and beautiful, with an easy banter, but at the same time it was also sensual and passionate and yet they were also so cute together, it really had me enchanted the whole time ! <3\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not free to love,\u201d I whisper, \u201cyou\u2019re not free at all.\u201d\n\n Well, I don\u2019t know what else to say to convince you that this fantasy is sooo much worth reading, especially because it doesn\u2019t leave you unsatisfied : there\u2019s an actual ending, real closure, without any cliffhanger."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "I SENSE THE BOY the moment he sets foot in the cave.

I was afraid I wouldn't like this book for reasons, but I really did enjoy it. I love Zahra the jinni from the lamp. Aladdin is a twat at times but he's wonderful too. Even though Aladdin found Zahra's lamp and he's her master for now, he's very kind to her. Zahra is one of the most powerful jinn in the world and she has been alive for 4000 years! Aladdin is out for revenge against Darian and his father who did some really messed up stuff to his family. And Zahra gets to come along for the ride. She does a good bit of shape shifting in the book and I loved that, the things you can ease drop on when your something else!Caspida is the daughter of the King but also a descendant to one of the gods of long ago. I loved her character as well. She was like a female Robin Hood but only in the sand, not the woods. lol She also has a bad to the bone band of women that were awesome too. Darian and his evil father are looking to take over the throne but not if Aladdin, Zahra and Caspida have anything to do with it! There are other things happening in the book and it's all good reading. It's a wonderful little love story that has a little of everything. Will Zahra and Aladdin make it?

This was the retelling of Aladdin I didn't know I was waiting for. It is definitely among one of the best retellings I have read. I especially loved the author's writing and her description in the last 4 chapters was enchanting. I could not be more glad that I decided to pick it up, it was great a great story enforced with even better characters.This is a story about a Jinni who is believed to have betrayed not only her kind but also the humans. She is left behind, in the remains of a city destroyed long ago because of the same mistake that started a war. But now, she has been released by a boy who doesn't hate her as all the others seem to, he dreams, dreams of avenging his parents and hopes for change. Now, bound to him through the lamp she travels with him until he makes his 3 wishes. On this journey she is offered a chance at freedom, to no longer be bound to her lamp, but the stakes are high and if she fails she will die. How much is she willing to barter for her freedom? What will sacrifice to finally be accountable to no one but herself?I LOVE these characters and everything they stand for. Getting to know them and seeing all that they have been through is both a heartbreaking and heart warming experience. Aladdin and his roguish charm, dreams, and loyalty along with Zahra and her sharp edges, wishes, and hope make a great pair.The Jinni much like Genies can grant you 3 wishes, but keep in mind \n\" Wishes have a way of twisting themselves, and there is nothing more dangerous than getting your heart\u2019s desire.\" \n. The Jinni are hated and feared because of a peace treaty that failed most disastrously in the past leading to an all out war. The entire concept of the Jinni and learning more about it was very fascinating. The idea of genies and lamps was incorporated into the story very well. The hierarchy and types of Jinni were well thought out, even if we didn't get to see much of them. I flew through this book and it surpassed all my expectations. My first Aladdin retelling and I had a marvelous time getting accustomed to this world and it's characters.

Without them, I would have taken one look at the description of earth-shaking love, went nope and clicked away.Is The Forbidden Wish heavy on romance? Admittedly, yes. Very early on in the story, Zahra develops an attraction for Aladdin, the boy, as we all know from the story, who let the genie (called \"jinni\" here) out of the lamp. This retelling sticks very close to the Disney version, with Zahra having been trapped in the lamp for thousands of years and Aladdin weaseling his way out of making a wish to get out of the cave. His first wish is to become a prince, and his second was to save his life, both of which occur sometime during the plot.His third wish was to free the genie. I suppose it's only a spoiler if you haven't watched the Disney movie and I highly doubt that. I won't say much beyond it happens and it was in a way that was foreshadowed, but I didn't see coming.My point is Disney's Aladdin is rather romance-centric, too. The story (mostly) starts with Aladdin wanting to win Princess Jasmine. Is it so jarring that a retelling sticks close to its romantic roots yet manages to be a well-written, wildly creative story on its own?It's more complex, more feminist. The filmmakers did a lovely job with Princess Jasmine and Khoury expands on that. Although Zahra is attracted to Aladdin, she doesn't let her feelings get in the way of her real goal: to win her freedom. She manipulates him into making wishes to serve her desires.\n\"As long as [the lamp] remains on Aladdin's person and as long as he remains alive, I am bound only by the invisible perimeter that surrounds the lamp. One hundred and forty-nine paces. I have measured it many, many times.\"\nJasmine is called Caspida and she is badass. So are her Watchmaidens, who act as her handmaidens, squad, and protectors. They remind me of the Sand Snakes\u2014not the twisted mockery of female power the show turned them into, but the one from the books who celebrate sisterhood and strength and obedience if the situation calls for it.And the romance is beautiful. Yes, it's death-defying and Cynical Natalie is rolling her eyes out as I type this, but Khoury made me care about these characters and their fears and hopes and dreams, and that makes all the difference.\n\"All the world is in your shadow, Zahra. I cannot help but see you when I close my eyes.\"\nThe writing is on the purple side, especially in the beginning, but it works so well with Zahra's personality and the mystic setting. A dream of a fantasy romance with vivid characters, strong overtones of sisterhood, and a brilliant plot that draws on Aladdin, but holds its own."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9659631-jacqueline", "userReview": "5/5 starsVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Tjx...This book was one of most anticipated reads of 2016 and it didn't not disappoint.

Trying to decide if I want to round up or down. I LOVED this book!***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***The Forbidden Wish by Jessica KhouryPublisher: RazorbillPublication Date: February 23, 2016Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC from First to ReadSummary (from Goodreads):She is the most powerful Jinni of all. He is a boy from the streets. Their love will shake the world... When Aladdin discovers Zahra's jinni lamp, Zahra is thrust back into a world she hasn't seen in hundreds of years -- a world where magic is forbidden and Zahra's very existence is illegal. She must disguise herself to stay alive, using ancient shape-shifting magic, until her new master has selected his three wishes. But when the King of the Jinn offers Zahra a chance to be free of her lamp forever, she seizes the opportunity\u2014only to discover she is falling in love with Aladdin. When saving herself means betraying him, Zahra must decide once and for all: is winning her freedom worth losing her heart?As time unravels and her enemies close in, Zahra finds herself suspended between danger and desire in this dazzling retelling of Aladdin from acclaimed author Jessica Khoury.What I Liked:I honestly have no idea how to review this book. It. Was. AMAZING. I've been waiting for this book for about two years now, since Khoury announced that her Aladdin story would be A Book. I adore Aladdin and all things Aladdin-retelling-y, so I knew I had to read this book. It's my first Khoury book and it certainly did not disappoint!This is a retelling of Aladdin like you've never seen. Zahra has been trapped in her lamp for thousands of years. It's by chance that a poor boy, Aladdin, finds the ruins in which she/the lamp lies, and takes the lamp. In Parthenia, jinn are hunted and captured, and Zahra's existence isn't allowed. Zahra is offered a chance at freedom by the King of the Jinn - rescue his son, who is trapped in Parthenia, and the King will free Zahra of her lamp. Aladdin is Zahra's best chance at getting into the Parthenian palace. But Zahra finds that she can't use Aladdin as a means to an end - she falls in love with him. In the end, she must choose - her freedom, or her love?This book is written entirely in Zahra's first-person POV, which I thought was very different but an excellent way of bringing about the story! We're used to Aladdin telling the story, but it's Zahra. Five hundred years ago, Zahra was slave to the Queen of Parthenia, but the queen treated her like a sister and an equal. But this was her downfall, and five hundred years later, jinn aren't free to roam and live among humans. Zahra has a lot of secrets and a lot of history, and Aladdin/we discover it little by little. This gives Zahra so much more depth and character, given how heartbroken she is about past decisions, and how misunderstood her side of history is. I really like Zahra, and I had no trouble connecting with her and understanding her. She's a powerful jinni, one of the last Shaitan. She's clever and tough and a warrior jinni through and through. I love how her mind works, and how she sticks to her plans and goals. Finding the Jinn King's son is her goal, but she doesn't expect to fall for Aladdin in the process.You may ask, why doesn't she just abandon Aladdin and go look for the Jinn prince? It is because Aladdin has her lamp, and Zahra cannot go more than 150 steps away from Aladdin, as long as he has the lamp on him. So, she uses something personal to get him to make a wish to be a prince; Aladdin has always wanted to take down the vizier who killed his parents, so Aladdin agrees to wish to be a prince and they go to the palace, both with very different motives. Zahra does not tell him about hers.I LOVE Aladdin! He is mischievous and wicked and so charming, everything that boy Aladdin in the Disney movie is, but in a more grown, mature sense. I mean, he's plenty mischievous, but he's also more of a man than the boy in the movie. He himself is also very smart, very clever, and oh so handsome. He's charming and adaptable, and he fits right in as a royal in the Parthenian palace. He's a good actor and a good person.I absolutely love the romance in this book. It's a subtle thing, but the chemistry between the characters is always there. Zahra tries so hard to staunch her burgeoning feelings for Aladdin, because she knows that it can't happen, for several reasons. Aladdin makes no attempt to stifle his feelings, though it takes him (them both, really) some time to realize what is happening between them. There are some really steamy encounters in this book! NO love triangle, people. There are secondary characters that are introduced that might SEEM like they could be legs to a triangle (on either side - Zahra's or Aladdin's), but I assure you, there is no love triangle. If this makes more sense: no one feels anything towards anyone else, and no one is interested in anyone else. A linear romance, I promise you! I'm stressing this because people will be introduced and might seem like threats but they never are and never would have been.Khoury did an amazing job of creating and molding this jinn world to fit her story! So many words and names that I recognize from other jinn stories, and interesting spins on other concepts. The world-building is beautiful and well-written! This story is different from the original story of Aladdin, and wholly its own. The ending is very busy and nail-biting! There is a lot going on in several different areas, and I was worried about several characters at once. I just could not seem to read the pages fast enough! I was very satisfied with the ending - it's a good one! Slightly on the cookie-cutter-perfect side, but I'll take it. I liked the ending!What I Did Not Like:I can't quite think of anything at the moment! This is more on the publisher's side, but I wish the publisher had kept the original cover! Nothing to do with the book itself, don't mind me...Would I Recommend It:I highly recommend this book! It was excellent! I had to read it over two days but I absolutely loved the book. There is a strong romance and lovely world-building! Plus, ALADDIN! Khoury does the tale of Aladdin justice, but also makes this story her own. Rating:4.5 stars -> rounded down to 4 stars. I'm not entirely sure why I'm rounding down to 4 stars - I'm still kind of vacillating in terms of the rating. It's a 4.5-star rating, people! I was extremely pleased with this book.SOOOOOOOOOOO EXCITED!!!! I love Arab-based books!

I was a little worried that this retelling would butcher my love for Aladdin but while it didn't disappoint, it didn't impress me either. However, I am pretty disappointed that we didn't get any magic carpet rides... But besides that, the story just seemed a little slow. It felt like a lot happened, when in reality not much really did. The Forbidden Wish was beautifully written and had its exciting moments, but I couldn't help but feel that something was missing in the story.Even though this was an Aladdin retelling, the character of Aladdin was more of a supporting character in the story than anything. Nonetheless, I still loved Aladdin! However, it really felt as if he was the damsel in distress in the story. Not that I'm complaining since I'm all for girl power and all but I just didn't particular like this detail in the book.As for our main character, Zahra... I didn't hate her, but I certainly wasn't attached to her. I enjoyed her character in the beginning but as the story went on, I began to grow weary of her. She just repeatedly kept feeling bad for herself and I got tired of the whole \"I can't love you, you can't love me. It's forbidden. And I'm ready to sacrifice my happiness as long as you live. BLAH BLAH BLAH.\" Zzz... I wanted to ship Aladdin and Zahra so bad but I just couldn't.If anything, I probably loved Caspida more than I liked Zahra and if the romance actually shifted to Aladdin and Caspida, I would've been all for it because unlike Zahra, Caspida actually embodies Princess Jasmine in the traditional sense of being the king's daughter and being forced to marry a prince. On top of that, Caspida and her Watchmaidens kick so much ass! I felt The Forbidden Wish would've been much better if Caspida was the heroine in the story and not Zahra. I would've prefer a Robin Williams-esque genie to be honest!Overall, this book was a pretty entertaining read. It was definitely one of the less disappointing book releases in the month of February."}, {"userName": "\u2606\u263dErica\u263e\u2606", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41218534-erica", "userReview": "The only evidence that there ever was a garden of wonders, the only testimony to the great city lost beneath the sand, is a single pale coin that lies on the surface, winking at the moon. And, of course, there is me.\nThis book is damn near flawless.I am in love with it. This book was literally so much fun and so much wonderful and so much delightful that I just want toThis is a retelling of Aladdin, with a few twists- including the fact that the jinni of the lamp is a girl named Zahra who has been alive for thousands of years. She is one of the most powerful jinni in existence, with magical powers that see no bounds, except for her lifetime imprisonment to the constantly changing masters of her lamp.Zahra herself is a wise and beautiful woman who has made the ultimate sin of the jinni once before: loving a human. So when she is freed from her lamp after a long and painful exile (think 500 years) by a young thief named Aladdin, she faces the human world with a newfound caution. Aladdin has followed the whisperings of a magic ring to find her, and seemingly is the only one who can hear its power. They set out together to fight unrest in Aladdin's kingdom, Zahra granting two wishes in their early time together. The story develops beautifully from there, and ceases to exist just in their own two realities. Their reach is expansive and explosive.From the first page of this story, I was absolutely hooked. I knew what was happening and was easily taken along this wonderful ride. There were no extended lags in the action or confusion on my part. The story was crisp, clear, and lovely. Aladdin, our male mc, is a jovial thief from the underworld of this monarchical society. He steals and forages for his next meal and for the possessions he desires. His parents were killed by a devious member of the monarchy for being rebels, so he is fighting with his own inner demons regarding that. His personality though is just glorious. He is smart, quick, charming, and altogether a charismatic person. Another incredible part of the story is how much is blows the Bechdel Test out of the water. There's a whole band of powerful warrior women called the Watchmaidens that is comprised of various princesses, including/ led by the future queen of the land. Like wow. I was worried at first, thinking the author may pit the women against Zahra and against each other eventually. But how pointless my worries were. This story contains an interminable amount of girl power and women working together to literally defeat the patriarchy. All the girls in this group also have their own unique weapons, which just made everything even more tremendous. Caspida, the leader of the group is just an absolutely spectacular character. She is truly the embodiment of a queen. And instead of being a huge douche, Aladdin is a powerful ally to their cause! Just when the world hasn't shook under me enough, he goes and crumbles it. (The mean guy is speaking to Aladdin in the beginning of this quote, Aladdin responds.)\n\"If Parthenia is going to become the power it once was, we need a strong leader. Someone the people look up to. Someone they've inspired and respected for years. Not some weak prince from some far-off kingdom nobody has even heard of. These people will never follow you.\"\"I don't need anyone to follow me. They will follow her.\"Women writers nowadays are absolutely killing this book-writing game. Goodness gracious.An additional thought: my family and I went to Disney World a fair few times when I was growing up. (Bear with me here, I'll get to the point in a second.) In one of the parks, Epcot, they have a \"world showcase\" where they create sections of the park devoted and designed to look like various countries. One of which was Morocco. Since I was very little, I was positively entranced by it. The sights, the colors, the sounds, the earthiness of it all. Every time we would come back, it was always the county I looked forward to most. Growing older, my love of that created world still hypnotized me. When I reached college and began studying Women's Studies and Anthropology, my interests now more informed about the world and cultures, I hoped to one day go there. I found a volunteer program that works with Women's Empowerment in Rabat, Morocco and I sought and still seek to go with that group. I've been saving, but it hasn't happened yet. I'm saying all this because this story's setting reminds me of Morocco. So, in a few less words, I also loved the setting. And listened to the Aladdin soundtrack while I was getting ready this morning. :DTo say the least, I loved this.

She's a girl who believes she's a monster and hates herself for it. I know this kind of character is bit of a archetype, but it's an archetype I personally love when done well.

I really loved the way Zhara was written and developed. \nYou can't choose what happens to you but you can choose who you come because of it.\nI have to admit, though, this whole thing felt a little insubstantial. But I can't even really complain about this, because that was the intention!! It's a romantic fantasy. This book was so clearly not for me to analyze!! It's not necessarily meant to be serious. It's a romantic fantasy, and it's a good one at that. I rushed through this and absolutely enjoyed it. That should be enough for me. Hopeless romantics will enjoy it maybe more than me, but this is was certainly very high quality as these books go and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who feels interested.

Bubbling and sizzling with lush imagination, with magic laced into every word and romance that doesn't make you gag, this book is a literary firecracker! One of the best novels I have read this year, The Forbidden Wish is the story of Aladdin with a perfect twist. Our Jinni isn't the hideous blue large ass amoeba dude but a headstrong diva, Zahra, with a dark history. In this retelling, Aladdin stumbles across the lamp, discovers Zahra and finds himself thrust into a magical adventure. Zahra, who has been trapped in her lamp for so long, wants nothing as much as she wants freedom. But as fate would have it, Zahra meets Aladdin, the thief who makes her question what she really wants. As soon as I started reading, I was tugged into a world very rich, very awe-inspiring. From the majestic garden of Roshana to the vast deserts and the Arabic streets of Parthenia to the magnificent Palace. Less writers know how to create a world this striking, this immaculately detailed, this impeccable. The characters are too, unblemished. The bond between each, admirable. The female characters; all positive role models. The action, neat. The plot, strong. The romance, captivating, mesmerizing, beautiful, perfect. Like words can't describe how much I love ice-cream on a particularly hot day, words can't also describe how much I loved the writing of Jessica Khoury. There is a very realistic feel to this fantasy, to the characters and their chemistry, every single scene between Aladdin and Zahra, reverberating and pulsating with life.

The writing is addictive, the romance is subtle and smooth, the jinni aspects are captivating, the story is great, and it is a fitting retelling of Aladdin. I didn't expect this one to be as great as it was, and I'm happy to say I've found a book that gives me The Wrath and The Dawn vibes!I haven't read anything by Jessica Khoury, so I went into this story with no expectations. I knew it was an Aladdin retelling, and I was stoked because Aladdin is one of my favorite Disney movies. Zahra is one of the most powerful jinnis and a curse has confined her to a lamp where she must slave herself to the wishes of humans. Given a chance at freedom by the omnipotent King of Jinn, Zahra must walk a narrow, complex line and decide if she has the heart to trick her latest master who she's starting to fall for in order to gain her greatest wish, freedom, or if that wish has changed to something more. Something like love...Both Zahra and Aladdin were such complex characters, and I really liked how they grew in this book. Zahra was a character who was easy to relate to and very likable. Her insecurities, fears, and past tragedies were laid bare to us readers, and I couldn't help but root for her to find happiness in the end. Aladdin struggles with his scheme to avenge his parents' death and his resistance to fighting for the common people instead of staying an ignorant, complacent thief. Aladdin and Zahra were such engaging characters, and I love their chemistry. Even from the beginning there seemed to be an invisible, intoxicating string binding these two together. Every smile, every glance, every scowl edged them closer and closer together. The romance was smooth and subtle and completely adorable. I love their banter and all the cute things they say around one another. This forbidden romance is definitely a slow-burn, and I really loved every second of it.This book is definitely influenced by Aladdin, yet it takes liberties and changes things to make it unique. The jinn world was so richly described, and I love the culture infused in the story. The writing was addictive, and I was impressed by the plotting. The beginning is a bit slower yet still engaging, and it picks up quickly. There's plenty of action, romance, deception, court politics, humor, and more to please readers.The secondary characters played a significant role in this story too, and I thought they were well developed. The Jafar in this book is just as nasty and Iago takes a different, more evil personality in this book. There are also some unfamiliar characters added to this story which really strengthened it. And girl power in the form of the Watchmaidens enters the story, and I am stoked! I wish there was a book focused solely on those awesome ladies. Sacrifice, friendship, and love are integral parts of this story, and I love all that Jessica imparts to readers through those themes. The ending was sweet and perfect and leaves readers wanting more.

Surprisingly, when I first heard about this book a year ago I wasn't sure if I would like it. Aladdin is my absolute favorite Disney movie and still didn't know if I would like this retelling or not. However, this book was such a surprise I just loved loved this re-imagined take on Aladdin. If you didn't know what this book was about, it tells the story of Aladdin and his jinni, if the jinni was a female. Zhara has been a jinni for over 4,000 years and has been imprisoned in the lamp for 500 years after her last master, a queen, is killed by Zhara's own hand leading to the downfall of the queen's empire and a legend of Zhara and her lamp. Aladdin finds this lamp and the story goes from there.What sold this for me was the writing and the world-building. I've always felt like Arabian myths have a certain aspect of story-telling that other folklore and fairytales just don't have. With Khoury's writing, the story-telling, although a YA narrative, still held that mythical beauty to it that really put me into the story. Now I don't mean this in a bad way (though I can see how people would be annoyed with this) but the descriptions are very very saturated with an overabundance of sensory words and images. However, this works and fits with the world that Khoury created and I don't think I would have liked this world as much if she hadn't described it in this way. With this book, the writing and the world-building go hand in hand. The writing makes the world and the world is so alive because of the writing. I enjoyed being in Zhara's point of view. When we learn in the first dozen or so pages that she is 4,000 years old, I immediately was nervous. Because she is so old and the fact that this was YA novel in her pov, I was really really REALLY hoping she wouldn't act like a typical YA heroine circa 17 years old. I mean, logically that just doesn't make sense with THAT MUCH life experience behind you. Will I don't really know how a 4,000 year old acts, I was so happy that, especially in the beginning, Zhara didn't act like she was 17. There were these really great moments in the beginning scenes where Zhara is observing everyone very indifferently and kind of rolling her eyes at Aladdin for flirting with other girls and I really liked that about her character because it made sense. Even when she and Aladdin start developing feelings for each other she tries and rises above it, but I mean, she had her moments. However I will get into Zhara's relationships in a few.Next, Aladdin. I'd be lying if I said at one point I wasn't picturing him in a purple vest and tan balloon pants. I mean, he was the perfect Aladdin for me. Surprisingly he didn't feel like a lead character at all but his go-with-the-flow personality, his lothario attributes, and wanting nothing to do with anything revolutionary really just FIT. Personally, I liked this version of Aladdin. His character lacked direction which was actually really refreshing for a male character in a YA book to be like \"I have no idea what I want to do.\" I also wanted to mention that a lot of tropes you see female YA characters fall into and experience in these books, Aladdin actually experiences and I LOVED THIS. I don't want to give away much for spoilers but if you read this, you'll know what part I'm talking about. I really liked seeing a male being put into that situation and seeing it from his side. Princess Caspida and her Watchmaidens were amazing. They were also extremely strong characters that I could have seen this whole story seen from their pov. That was the great thing about the plot of this book that it was so much bigger than any of these characters and effected every single person that it could have been told by the lot of them and I really liked that. I want to quick touch on the relationships with Zhara and her last two masters - Roshana and then Aladdin. So, what caused the war between humans and jinn over 500 years ago was the fact that Zhara loved Roshana as a sister and jinns are forbidden to love humans. So after Roshana, the queen, is killed Zhara is hidden away for 500 years until Aladdin finds her and she, obviously, falls in love with him too, this time as a romance. Here's the thing, the narrative is told almost like a love letter to Roshana as Zhara often used \"you\" in the narrative. At least to me, I almost would have preferred Zhara and Roshana to have been romantically involved just because as I was reading, I really FELT that their relationship went beyond friendship. And I actually like that more, but instead felt like all this stress on their sisterly bind felt forced. I think Zhara was in love with Roshana.A few things preventing me from rating it a 5. I actually enjoyed the first half more than the second half. I don't know if it was because of my reading mood or what, but the beginning was explosive and the second half was just ok for me. Another thing was the lack of culture shock of Zhara. She was stuck in a lamp for 500 years and once Aladdin and her return to the city, she doesn't so much as blink. Like, I know it's a fantasy setting, but the people of this world would have advanced A LOT in 500 years, it would be impossible not to. Overall, I really recommend this novel. I highly enjoyed it!"}, {"userName": "Katerina Kondrenko", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36306002-katerina-kondrenko", "userReview": "5.5 out of 10\n\u0420\u0435\u0432\u044c\u044e \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0435/This review on my blogLiving A Thousand Lives (please use Chrome/Yandex browser or Android/IOS to see the page; otherwise, spoiler-tags I use to make my post compact may not work)Short-Soundtrack:Ancient Arabian Music - Arabian NightsTwo Steps From Hell \u2013 False PrinceActive Child \u2013 These ArmsGenre: retelling, fantasy, YA with a hint of upper-YAStuff: jinn, Aladdin, court, liesFail: fairytale-ish muchWOW: humor, writing stylePOV: 1st-person, femaleLove-Geometry: seemingQuote-Core: \n\"Even a thief may have honor, and even a jinni may have a heart.\"\nBuddy-read with Nastassja and Kristalia. I finished last, 'cause couldn't stop rereading ADSoM and AGoS, daydreaming about Rhy.After \nThe Forbidden Wish\n I got that I'm not a fan of fairytales. Dark retellings? Yes, please. But stories without complicated morality aren't my thing. I appreciate rich writing and unusual twists, but it's not enough for me to fall for the characters and to enjoy a typical ending. Maybe Arabian theme and Aladdin-ish stuff aren't my things either?This book is about powerful jinni Zahra trapped in her lamp. She is a-freaking-amount-of-years-old and had been out of anyone's reach for millenniums. Then magical ring led a boy Aladdin to her beautiful prison and our story began.First of all, this Aladdin is not your old-fashioned Disney hero. His parents were rebels, but he wants nothing to do with their business, he'd love to avenge their deaths but prefers gambling games, women and alcohol. The canonical thing is that he's still a thief. Zahra is not your typical jinni as well. You have to keep her lamp with you or she would return inside it. If someone else would touch it, she'll become his or her servant, even if you haven't made your all three wishes. But if you'd manage to return the lamp, jinni is yours again. Do we have more characters? Yes. There are king's brother (an evil bastard) Sulifer and his son Prince Darian, they are Aladdin's swore enemies. There are the King himself and his daughter Caspida (future Queen of Parthenia) and her Watchmaidens (handmaidens with ninja skills). And there are King of Jinn Nardukha and his son Zhian. Others are crowd of extras.Aladdin would try to achieve his goal (which is to punish Sulifer and Darian; yup, he'd spend years doing nothing but now he's ready to fight) with Zahra's help, while she would use him for her purpose. There would be slow-burning romance and angst and fire. I hope you'll like it more than I. My problem is simple. I had no connection with MCs. They aren't lame or something, but I didn't feel them anyway. Too bad for me, 'cause Khoury's prose is vivid and sensual.My other issue was obviousness. I mean, bad people are pure bad, good ones are good, even if they do something questionable. You have no choice but to support team-GoodOnes, since author gives you no alternative. Remember \nThe Grisha Trilogy\n? There was what I call complicated morality. Readers empathized with antagonists and protagonists and even those who were in between. In \nThe Forbidden Wish\n you know from the start who is nice and who is not, no matter how they act, and everything is decided for you.The story itself is good, without huge holes and illogical things. I did love Khoury's version of jinn nature, her vision and changes she made. I wasn't bored (well, only a few times) or angry, it was a smooth read. I wound't mind more development of... everything, but it's a standalone novel and there was no room for such moves.The ending was super HEA. It's ok, but there was nothing to cry after or be sad for. I like bitter-sweet finals, they touch more strings of my soul. In TFW's case, I was skipping passages during last 15% of the book. I didn't care what would happen, who would die (if so) and who'd win. But it just me and my indifference for Aladdin, Zahra and the other characters.Overall, \nThe Forbidden Wish\n is a decent book among other retellings, but you have to be in a right mood and don't expect something dark and shocking or complicated and strong."}], "description": "She is the most powerful Jinni of all.
