When this one was offered on NetGalley, it piqued my interest so I grabbed it. I found it to be an interesting book about a young woman's love life--yet it wasn't a romance in the usual sense. While Hannah was certainly the main character, she did not appear in all scenes and one of the subplots did not really involve her at all. Semi-Sweet is set in a small Irish town and was actually first published in Ireland. I enjoyed reading about some of the differences in Irish culture and ours. The town in which this book was set was one small enough that everyone knew everyone, yet the characters often took taxis. Prices for things were quoted in Euros or Pounds Sterling, which given my total lack of knowledge of currency exchange, meant nothing to me. American spelling was used in this book.For a short book, Semi-Sweet had a lot going on. We follow Hannah through several relationships; watch Alice and Tom go to Hell and back, and cheer Adam on as he reaches out to the mysterious musician. Nora is easy to hate, and I just wanted to shake Leah. Patrick didn't change Will the cupcake shop make it? One disadvantage of reviewing a NetGalley edition rather than the published book is that I don't know if the issues I had with the formatting will be in the final, or not. As I noted above, there is a lot happening in this book and the story lines don't really tie together. One paragraph would be about one story line and then the next about another, and there were no visual cues in the galley I read to tell me to shift gears. Only after realizing that the paragraph I just read didn't make sense when added to the one before did I realize that I had been shifted to a different story line. Perhaps the final will have some sort of heading or spacing to show this.I wonder if there is going to be a sequel because the ending, while definitely showing that things are heading in the right direction does not give any final outcome to the relationships. There are lots of incidences of non-marital intimacy in the book, but mostly we are left on the other side of the bedroom door.

For Hannah Robinson, it\u2019s all she\u2019s ever wanted; a cute cupcake store on the corner, a wonderful boyfriend and armfuls of potential. She thought she had it all, but when her boyfriend announces quite suddenly that he\u2019s leaving her for another woman with only days to prepare for her store\u2019s opening she\u2019s devastated. Through the help of her best friend Adam and the drive to finish what she set out to do Hannah opens her store and keeps busy. All the while her ex-boyfriend, Patrick has learned he\u2019s going to be a father from his new girlfriend and Hannah has found a new potential love interest. This and more is what awaits readers of Semi-Sweet: A Novel of Love and Cupcakes.Where to begin? How could you possibly go wrong with a cupcake shop? You really can\u2019t, and I loved Hannah\u2019s shop with it\u2019s unique decorations and quaint atmosphere. I\u2019m a huge fan of food in Chick Lit books, especially when it\u2019s done well. In Semi-Sweet: A Novel of Love and Cupcakes Hannah gives herself seven months to make it work and she absolutely does. How could anyone survive such a horrendous break-up only a week before opening your own business? Yet for Hannah it was just the perfect thing to keep her busy and moving forward to the next great thing.As for the love interests in the book\u2026for some reason, even now, I still wanted Hannah to end up with her best friend Adam. What is it about girls with best guy friends and wanting them to suddenly discover they\u2019re in love with each other? It must be partially due to my love of the movie My Best Friends Wedding. But seriously, I loved the tension and friendship between Adam and Hannah as well as there pact to marry each other if they were both still single in their 60\u2032s. So adorable! That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed Hannah and Adam\u2019s respective love interests throughout the book as well as many of the supporting cast.As for the remaining characters in the story\u2026Geraldine, Fiona, Stephen, Wally, John, Leah, Nora, Dave, Claire, Una, Alice, Tom and a few others. It all got to be a bit much for me. It was a bit like reading a soap opera with just as much sexual happenings as well. I think that though I loved some of the supporting cast, my disappointment came when I was becoming engrossed in Hannah\u2019s story and suddenly without little or no notice at all I\u2019m whisked away to another character I\u2019d have to take a moment to remember. In the first hundred or so pages it was a bit confusing, but once I got acquainted with everyone it started to get easier. What I really wanted was more of Hannah and Adam\u2019s story as well as perhaps a bit of Leah and Patrick. Though the main characters were still more than present in many of the scenes I would have enjoyed it a bit more were they not chopped up so much.Regardless of my misgivings, Semi-Sweet: A Novel of Love and Cupcakes was an incredibly fun read. As Hannah stumbles through her recovery from losing Patrick you are able to see the wonderful person she is and all she has to offer the world. A story about finding oneself, enjoying life and making the most of every moment no matter the circumstances. A wonderfully enjoyable and quick read from Roisin Meaney!Originally reviewed and copyrighted at Chick Lit Reviews."}, {"userName": "Shelleyrae at Book'd Out", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1607230-shelleyrae-at-book-d-out", "userReview": "Semi-Sweet is an engaging story with surprising depth and emotion. Hannah's fairytale romance abruptly ends when her live in boyfriend leaves her for someone else. The other woman, Leah, has ensured Patrick's attention by deliberately falling pregnant, but he has already proved loyalty is not his strong suit. Hannah's best friend Adam, has a crush on a painfully shy clarinet player, while his twin sister is looking for a little fun. Family friend Alice, is concerned by her husband's growing dependence on alcohol and the strain it is placing on their marriage. The novel examines the complex web of relationships in a small Irish town, and how the loss, and gain, of love changes them.Hannah's story is central, her breakup with Patrick, her anxiety over the launch of her new business, and then her fledgling romance and attraction as she begins to recover from Patrick's duplicity, leads the character driven novel. Hannah is immediately sympathetic and Meany has captured the emotions of loss and mourning when a relationship ends suddenly with a deft hand. I think because we as the reader are aware of what a creep Patrick is, it does get a bit wearing as Hannah dwells in misery, but the rebuilding of her battered self confidence is realistic, which creates a well rounded and very likeable character. Hannah is surrounded by friends and family in her small Irish town, and Meaney uses their perspective to reflect Hannah's experiences as well as develop subplots that weave their way through the story. We see different sides to the relationship between Leah and Patrick that couldn't be explored from a single viewpoint. Similarly we are able to follow Adam's growing crush on ?? and her brother's attraction to Hannah. The ties between this group of characters, also including Nora and Patrick are well managed and the shifts in perspective generally smooth. Alice's story didn't work for me. She is peripherally connected to Hannah as a family friend, but her relationship is very self contained and the drama it provides barely touches the other characters at all. As the other subplot's are intimately tied to Hannah, it seemed an odd addition to the storyline.With so many characters having the opportunity to provide different perspectives on events, and each other, Meaney highlights the shades of grey found in real life. Leah is firstly introduced as a calculating mistress, for example, but slowly earns our sympathy as she struggles with her cold and judgmental mother and Patrick's callous behaviour. Semi-Sweet is not the lighthearted chic lit I was expecting but something rather more complex in both style and theme. At times both sweetly romantic and painfully emotional, it is a charming and satisfying read."}, {"userName": "Wendy Hines", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4997255-wendy-hines", "userReview": "Just days before Hannah Robinson is to open her own shop, her live-in boyfriend dumps her. He says he has found someone new and moves out on the eve of her celebration party. Shocked and heart-broken, Hannah throws herself into her shop. She arises every morning at three am to make dozens of delectable cupcakes to sell in her shop. She knows she needs to find another housemate to help her pay the bills, but she is too sad and busy to worry about it right now. Patrick feels bad about dumping Hannah, but it couldn't be helped. He was enjoying juggling two women, but Leah became pregnant so he moved in with her. But things are not going well with Leah's mother as she plays bridge with Hannah's mother and the two are not happy with their offspring. Then Hannah's best friend Adam decides to move in with Hannah to help her pay the bills and to let his sister Nora use his flat, since she is recently divorced and needs somewhere to stay. Nora finds a job as a PA assistant for Patrick and becomes the perfect dalliance for Patrick to escape his humdrum life. Adam takes to going to a new wine bar on the weekends and urges Hannah to come along. Adam has his eye on a shy blonde who plays the clarinet. But Hannah starts to see one of the players who also comes into her shop, a carpenter named John. Meanwhile, Geraldine, Hannah's mother, works at the Glass Slipper for a woman named Alice. Alice's husband Tom works with Geraldine's husband Steven. Alice is concerned about Tom's habit of drinking and when an accident brings things to a head, life gets sticky for everyone concerned. A top-notch cast of characters whose lives intermingle will have you cheering and booing at some of their choices and antics. I totally despised the characters of Tom and Patrick but I really enjoyed Hannah, Adam and Geraldine. You will find yourself caught up in their lives, sharing their heartbreaks, triumphs and zest for life. Roison Meaney's writing reminded me alot of Debbie Macomber and Jill Mansell. I really enjoyed the writing and the dialogue between the characters as well as having a novel that ended without any loose ends.

I really enjoyed the book overall and liked the protagonist and her best friend Adam. I also liked the different stories and the constant back and forth between. HOWEVER, some characters were as clich\u00e9ed as \"pure evil\" cartoon characters and one is left wondering why they are behaving the way they do. For example: SPOILER alert: Although there is a brief explanation for Patrick's behavior near the end, it seems rather unrealistic that a man would treat women the way he does after his own mother DIED. And there is no explanation for Nora's backstabbing and betrayal whatsoever. I guess the fact that she lived in the U.S. is explanation enough for being such a skank?? I also couldn't stand some of the characters, who were supposed to be like-able. I got really annoyed by Vivienne and her odd behaviors and the middle school bullying seems like the lamest PG rated excuse ever! No one would be THIS shy, after 12 years and with a loving family! Uhhh! I also didn't like Alice too much. She never spoke up and just seemed to dwell in self pity when her husband needed help-and let's face it: she was partly to blame! I also wish we had known a little more about Wally, besides the fact that he drives a cab, has a sister and mother, and loves wool hats. It was also never explained why the heck he got into that accident... it seems weird that the book got into so much detail about Patrick and Jack's \"love making\" qualities, but fails to mention if Wally is even a good kisser. Anyway, overall still liked the book a lot, and enjoyed the end, although it was predictable at least halfway through the book."}, {"userName": "Sorairo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11366796-sorairo", "userReview": "Ho rimandato da anni la lettura a questo libro regalatomi che dovevo leggere per una challenge lo scorso anno che poi ho abbandonato perch\u00e8, niente..

In questo il libro mi \u00e8 un p\u00f2 parso un \"Seggio vacante\" della Rowling un p\u00f2 mal riuscito ed elementare, ma comunque gradevole. Dal fattaccio di Hannah conosciamo la storia di tutte le persone che hanno contatto con lei, pi\u00f9 o meno marginalmente, in quel del paesino irlandese di Clongarvin dove tutti sanno tutto di tutti. Quindi conosciamo la solida routine dei genitori di Hannah, il comportamento bastardo dell'ex di Hannah,Patrick, e tutti i suoi sordidi giochetti, la nuova fiamma di Patrick, Leah che \u00e8 un'ingenua che si crede furba, il gioviale e Peter Pan amico di Hannah, Adam, e la sciacquetta di sua sorella,Nora , tanto star ma senza valere nulla, i retroscena scomodi di tutti, ma anche le piccole sorprese.

Patrick informs Hannah that he can no longer pretend to love her. He has found someone else. Hannah\u2019s life starts to crumble.

Hannah\u2019s good friend, Adam convinces Hannah to open her shop and give it at least seven months before she gives up. Hannah becomes a bit distracted that she does not even notice when a handsome customer starts flirting with her. Oh, what is a woman to do!To be honest, I personally could not get into this book. I did give it several tries. While, I did think this was a nice read, I just could not connect with the characters. I found them to be a little too into every one else\u2019s business and I especially wanted to shake Hannah and tell her to forget Patrick, she deserved better and move on. Instead, she seemed lost without him and kept pining over him, until about the last half of the book. This is when she did realize that she deserved better and in fact there was someone else that was interested in her. Though, I did like Adam.

So if you want to know what it's like to start a cupcake shop in an Irish town in the middle of a recession and a disastrous love life, this book is for you. What this book really needed was some humor. It wasn't entirely depressing or anything, but really some humor would have done wonders for it. Made it less humdrum ordinary. The relationships entered into at the end don't really seem destined to last, even though what you look for in a book like this is lasting true love. And I'm not sure how stable the cupcake shop is going to be in the long run (how long can a tiny Irish town keep ordering cupcakes anyway?) Also, Tom, well, no one in this book really seems to want to face reality with that one (or care, maybe?) since no one seems to think about his future, but it's pretty clear to me that he's going to have some time on his hands to re-assess his life. I think the author could have made her characters more endearing, make you care about them more. On the plus sides, it was about cupcakes and it was a fast read.

I feel that Ms Meaney could well end up on my favourites list if this particular book is anything to go by.Set in Eire during the recession this is a tale of multiple characters going on with their daily lives - loving, losing, surviving - as every ordinary person must. Although a disparate bunch they are linked by the central Hannah, be they her friends, a friend of her parent's, sister to her best friend or simply a customer at work. This book reminded me in no small way of Maeve Binchy's books. Stories of real people doing real things and something extraordinary can happen in a split second - be that for good or ill. This is very definitely not a criticism as it takes talent to weave so many disparate tales together and make even the minutiae of going to work even vaguely enjoyable to read. Enjoyable is very definitely what this book is and you do find yourself thinking \"well, a couple more pages won't hurt - this next bit is about Leah/Alice/Whoever and I want to know what they are up to now\". This is not helped by the book being split in to months and not chapters so it is way harder than you would think to put down.There is no overt characterisation here, the story starts and you just have to hold the wuthor's hand and follow her in to these complex lives. Strangely by the time you get to the end of January you already have a good feel for who everyone is and what their personal strengths and weaknesses are. You are taken on an emotional roller coaster in every section and the major incident about halfway through is shocking and its aftermath is far reaching and feels entirely realistic and heartrending. I am sure there was a plot arc written down for this book but somehow it doesn't feel plotted, it feels like that is just the way the days unfolded and this is what happened so we'll go with the flow.I will admit that I had to do a quick internet search for a couple of things when reading - being neither from Eire or a Catholic - I had no idea what Chocolate Kimberley Biscuits were (no I wish I didn't know because I am craving them!) or a Month's Mind. See, even a novel that is firmly categorised as Chick Lit can teach you something!Wonderful story telling with warmth and doesn't shy away from the nastiness of human nature.

I really enjoyed this book, and this is coming from someone who normally doesn't read chick-lit, and can only handle so much romance at once...I'm just not into that whole love-dovey ooey gooey romance xP...(maybe that's why I loved the book? idk)Unlike what a lot of people are saying here, I actually find the characters quite relatable. I feel like for shy women who are self conscious and are sensitive to what others think about them, they would want to hide their husband's alcoholic tendencies, and any \"embarrassment\" that would cause. And because Alice was so timid, and didn't want to stand up to her husband (she sounds like me- avoiding conflict at all costs), that's what ultimately what caused the horrible accident. Quite unfortunate, but I know for a fact that it happens more often than it should.The dialogue wasn't cheesy, which I loved. And there's a variety of characters all going through their personal problems, and you get to see how some of those stories connect. I think it was written pretty well, and realistic enough for me :)What I wished could have been different: I thought there was going to be more development with her cupcake shop. The whole point of the book was the 7-month trial period, to see how her business would grow. I feel like towards the end, the cupcake shop itself wasn't really a part of the story. I wished there were more details on the growth of the shop. And on the cupcakes!*spoiler alert. beepbeepbeep* I feel like Hannah breaking up with John Wyatt was understandable once I gave it more thought- she's still kind of hung up on her ex, and he's hung up on his family. But...getting with Wally...I didn't expect that. We don't really know much about Wally. He just kind of...appeared. Not sure if I liked that part as much.Anyway. I really did enjoy this story.

Faced with starting a business on her own, Hannah begins to wonder if her life-long dream has just turned into a nightmare. So her best friend Adam sets his birthday as a deadline - seven months to make her shop a success, or walk away from it all. And as Hannah immerses herself in her new business, she soon discovers that she's too busy to think about Patrick and his now pregnant girlfriend ...or to notice an increasingly regular customer who has recently developed a sweet tooth for all things cupcake. But while Hannah is slowly piecing her life back together, family friend Alice's is falling apart. Her husband Tom's drinking is getting out of control and things are about to get a whole lot worse. As the seven-month milestone approaches, Hannah must decide her future. And while she's figuring out what's really important, it becomes clear to everyone that happiness in life, and in love, is all in the making.:>:>:>:>:>:>:>:>:>+_+_+<:<:<:<:<:<:<:<:<:Review: The first thing that happened when I looked at this book was that my stomach started menacingly growling for the delicious looking cupcakes on the front cover of Semi-Sweet! Semi-Sweet has it all. Drama, romance, cheats, new businesses, and incredibly edible sweets. Have you ever noticed how many books are coming out these days with centerpieces of food? What makes Semi-Sweet different from all of these other novels is the flow of the writing of Roisin Meaney! This acclaimed and best-selling Irish author writes a book that shows the daily and life troubles of each character with immense detail and skill. Hannah Robinson's life is turned into a hectic nightmare the second her boyfriend Patrick leaves her for another. This other woman later on, is found out to even be pregnant! Now, Hannah must figure out her love life while opening a new cupcake bakery in a small, Irish town. At first, Hannah is supported by her mother and best friend, Adam. Adam gives her a challenge, live through seven months of the shop-until his birthday and if she can survive that she will keep on with the shop. If she can't make it to his birthday, she can just step away from it all. Alice has her own problems. She has a husband who is turning into an alcoholic...and she can't stop the metamorphous. While trying to stop a long marriage from the runes, she goes through a lot of events. Some are heartbreaking, others life-changing. Roisin Meaney really goes into detail about each character by playing out each person's hopes, thoughts, and words into sections of the book. Each small little section in a chapter has a different eye point. She switches from character to character for each little scene. Though the book was kind of lingering near the middle, the rest of it really had a phenomenal story! Anyone who loves food and learning lessons of life would find this book to be a perfect match.My Thoughts on the Cover: Like I said at the beginning of my review, the book really brings out the cupcake cravings in you! I love how it shows all the exotic flavors that Hannah goes out with. The bicycle also gives out this small town feel to it. The cover shows the feel of the novel in whole.*Thank you to 5 Spot and Roisin Meaney for sending out the ARC for review!As of today, people in the U.S. can go out and buy a copy of the book!

Of course I was drawn to the title. Anything mentioning cupcakes always has my instant attention. Then I saw the beautiful cover that is reminiscent of the 50's era. I can just imagine a Mrs. Cleaver type behind the counter, while young girls with poodle skirts enter the store. So yes, I was interested in reading it.Hannah Robinson is a great girl. She is about to open her very own business, a cupcake shop in town. She signed the lease, fixed the shop up, and has perfected her recipes. She's a good daughter, a great friend, and a wonderful girlfriend. So why is it, that her boyfriend, Patrick, has just told Hannah that he no longer wants to pretend to love her and proceeds to tell her that he is leaving her for someone else? And why tell her right before a dinner party being held for her?Hannah goes through the story living through a harsh and heart breaking break-up. It doesn't help that she lives in a small town and soon, everyone knows about her business, who Patrick is, and eventually, who the other woman is. It was easy to relate to Hannah. She is trying to save herself after such a tragic experience. She felt that Patrick was the love of her life and after his infidelity, she still had to be strong enough to run her business. I couldn't help but sympathize with Hannah. You wish for everything to work out in her world. You will love the various cast of characters in Semi-Sweet. Although, there are some who you will despise. But Meaney's writing is so thorough that her intention for each character comes through loud and clear. Their lives separate, yet intertwined. The story is told in a very different manner than most books that I have read. You start with Hannah's point-of-view, then proceed to Patrick's, and with each character that becomes a focal point, you switch to their point-of-view. At first, it was a little too much to constantly switch from one voice to another, but after a while, it became a necessary part of the book. I was able to see each character in many different angles. I was able to understand their thought process, what they thought of the situation. To a certain extent, I feel like I'm a part of the town, being a part of the gossip mill. Meaney writes a story with a main plot and several sub plots. She introduces characters that have depth and individuality that you can't help but be emotionally invested. While the different points of view may be confusing, it is also genius on how Meaney came about with the structure of the book. Nothing is happy ever after, just semi-sweet. It's a great read and I think you should add it to your bookshelf today."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/365038-cindy", "userReview": "I find that I remember clearly all of the characters in this book, the story lines and the setting which is the small Irish (fictional) town of Clongarvin and the charming cupcake shop on the corner opened by the main character of Hannah. Remembering this book three months later speaks volumes for the reason I gave it 4 stars! The book opens with Hannah's excitement at fulfilling her dream of opening a cupcake shop. She is getting ready to go to a congratulatory dinner party with her live in love Patrick when out of the blue he announces he doesn't love her anymore. Of course this event drew my sympathy for Hannah immediately and my hatred for the schmuck Patrick! Hannah continues to the dinner party and I am wrapped up with how she is going to make it through this heartbreak.The truth is revealed about Patrick who moves in with:Leah-the witch who purposely got herself pregnant to cement the relationship to the horror of:Fiona-Leah's mother who at once seems coldhearted and more worried about what the women at bridge club are going to think about her daughter and the illegitimate child. The women at bridge club include:Geraldine-Hannah's mother who is a 'Leave it to Beaver' type character who works in the town's shoe store owned by:Alice-who is married to: Tom-who has a drinking problem that leads to tragedy and partner in a dental practice with:Stephen-Hannah's father.Another character is:Vivienne-a shy introverted woman who is a musician and still lives with her mother but strikes the love interest of: Adam-Hannah's best friend who is so supportive of her new cupcake shop telling her to give it 7 months, until his birthday, and then reevaluate the business. He moves in with Hannah to help with bills turning his apartment over to his evil twin sister:Nora-a cold and calculating woman just back from America and who goes to work as an assistant to:Patrick-the ex who starts an affair with her and leads this reader to feel sympathetic towards:Leah-the pregnant mistress who didn't realize what she was getting herself into with Patrick.Wow! The book also includes several other characters! What strikes me is the way all of the characters lives intertwine with one story line leading to another in this small Irish town that seems to be the same as the small Midwestern town that I live in. I was interested in each character and where the story was going to end up.I would be anxious to read more about the happenings in this small Irish town and can see this book being the first in a series, but I'm just not sure the author agrees with this reader!I recommend this book as a charming and sometimes infuriating journey into life in a small town."}, {"userName": "Jlaurenmc", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2766565-jlaurenmc", "userReview": "In her latest novel released to the U.S., Roisin Meaney channels the best of one of my favorite authors, Maeve Binchy. Set in Ireland, her novel Semi-Sweet: A Novel of Love and Cupcakes boasts charming characters, a lovely small town setting, and a deftly-woven plot. Semi-Sweet is the Irish equivalent of a cozy mystery, minus the mystery. I suppose you could categorize it as \"chick lit\", although I often dislike that term; still, if ever a book fit that bill, this one probably did. Meaney calls on a large cast of characters to populate Semi-Sweet. Although cupcake shop owner Hannah is arguably the novel's main character, her fictional town of Clongarvin is speckled with equally interesting characters: her parents, Geraldine and Stephen; Geraldine's boss Alice and Stephen's fellow dentist Tom; Hannah's best friend Adam and his sister Nora; Hannah's ex, Patrick and his new (pregnant) girlfriend Leah; Leah's mother (and Geraldine's fellow bridge player) Fiona; and musicians Wally, John, and Vivienne. Readers get a glimpse into all of these characters lives, from their triumphs to their extreme failures. Through her rich characters, Meaney fairly brings Clongarvin, Ireland, to life.The plot is (as most plots are) based around a series of problems, most of which sort themselves out in one way or another as the novel moves along. Hannah has just opened a cupcake shop, a daunting task in the slow economy. Almost at the same time, Patrick leaves her for his pregnant mistress Leah. Leah's mother Fiona is not exactly thrilled with either her daughter bearing an illegitimate child or with facing Hannah's mother Geraldine at bridge club. To help with her expenses after Patrick leaves, Hannah's best friend Adam moves in with her and rents his own apartment to his sister Nora, freshly home from living in America. Alice and Tom face problems brought about by Tom's constant drinking. The musicians from the local wine bar insinuate themselves into the other characters' lives with one love affair after another. Geraldine and Stephen are almost narrators in the novel, as no action revolves around them, but they provide commentary on all the other characters' escapades.Semi- Sweet and the town of Clongarvin are charming, as is Meaney's cast of characters. I highly recommend this novel, especially if you enjoy books set in Ireland as much as I do. Bonus: the cupcake recipe included at the novel's start."}, {"userName": "Lindsay Paige", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2323502-lindsay-paige", "userReview": "Title Thoughts: I love it. The book is semi-sweet.Cover Thoughts: I really like it because the shop is a big part of Hannah's life.WARNINGS: Vague sex every now and then.I really enjoyed this book. I liked how we saw the lives of many of the characters in the book. That allowed me to better understand the characters. It allowed me to understand how certain actions affected them. I don't think it would have been as good if it only showed Hannah's life. This isn't your usual romance like we usually think of. The romances in Semi-Sweet are real relationships with real problems. The book doesn't focus on just the romances either. We see one person try and grow out of their shell. We see three people who are recovering from a break up. We see people struggling with death and drinking. This book is a book that is about life. The surprises that come along. The lies, deceit, death, and all the trials and tribulations that come with life. All of those things are in this book.Meaney tells this book really well. She took me to a small town in Ireland and introduced a group of people. From there, she hooked me with her characters and held my interest about what would happen to them all. I liked that she had characters that I really liked and characters that I didn't like. Some characters deserved just what was coming at them while others dealt with the pain and hurt from them.Addict's Last Words: This book, to me, is about hope and holding on. It's about not giving up just because the going got tough. It's about keeping your heart open, even if you have been hurt.To Buy or To Borrow: I wouldn't mind having it on my shelf.Disclosure: A time limited copy of this book was provided for me by NetGalley.com.

In the midst of a breakup, she moves in with her best friend who makes her promise to keep trying to make the business a success for at least seven months. As time moves on there is love, relationships, breakups and a tragic death in the town. A family friend suffers a major loss, and Hannah realizes that someone she considers her enemy might just have more in common with her than she thought. When Alice and her husband hit a sudden turning point in their lives, everything becomes uncertain. Semi-Sweet is a simple, easy read that has an element of charm to it. Some characters were very realistic, and believable, while others not so much. The main characters like Hannah, Adam, Patrick and Leah got very little attention at times, and the main plot seemed interrupted by other characters constantly being brought into play. The story of Alice and Tom was very oddly placed and had no relation to the rest of the story, and took a lot of time away from the real plot. It felt like it was distracting from Hannah\u2019s story which is what I really wanted to hear about. Parts of it were compelling and left me wanting to know what happens next, but those moments were few and far between. I enjoyed the way the author described both the characters and the setting. There was an attention to detail that made it very easy to picture the scene in my mind, which is one of the most important things for me when reading a book.I\u2019d recommend this story to someone looking for an easy to read, predictable story. Despite some heavier topics, Semi-Sweet is still a lighthearted read and leaves the reader feeling satisfied at the end of the book. Personally, I've got mixed feelings about this book. I liked the idea of it, and most aspects of the story, however there were some parts that just distracted too much from the main plot that I couldn't get into it. Too many extra characters were introduced and Alice\u2019s story simply didn't work. Overall it wasnt a bad book, but I wouldn't choose to read it again, and it didn't make me intrigued to read anything else by the author."}, {"userName": "ChiaraRouge", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6757822-chiararouge", "userReview": "Ho ucciso le stelline a forza di toglierle e aggiungerle. In verit\u00e0 si merita qualcosa in pi\u00f9 delle 2 ma leggermente meno di 3.Cupcake Club non \u00e8 un grande libro: carino, scorrevole ma niente di speciale. Mi \u00e8 piaciuta la scelta dell'autrice di narrare in terza persona approfondendo singolarmente i personaggi principali, credo sia la prima volta che un libro mi offre una panoramica completa.Penso che l'autrice avrebbe potuto soffermarsi un po di pi\u00f9 sulla parte descrittiva anzich\u00e8 limitarsi a muovere i personaggi come fossero robot radiocomandati.Gli eventi sono prevedibili e scontati, e gi\u00e0 dalle prime pagine avevo intuito il finale.Ho trovato Patrick un clich\u00e8 vivente, il classico uomo da romanzetto rosa: stronzo, traditore, che pensa alle donne come oggetti sessuali per soddisfare i propri bisogni, senza alcun legame sentimentale. Ho riso quando ha portato la donna per cui ha lasciato la fidanzata (solo perch\u00e8 \u00e8 rimasta incinta- altrimenti avrebbe continuato a tenerle entrambe, come ha confessato lui stesso) a Parigi per San Valentino esattamente come aveva fatto con Hannah l'anno prima, affibbiando persino la stessa scusa.Mi sarebbe piaciuto conoscere meglio Hannah per potermi fare un opinione su di lei, dato che era il personaggio principale ma a quanto pare l'autrice ha preferito darmi una panoramica superficiale degli eventi anzich\u00e8 soffermarsi singolarmente sui protagonisti.In conclusione mi aspettavo molto di pi\u00f9 da questo libro, sono rimasta delusa, seppur non avessi grandi aspettative.Lo consiglio? Non lo so. Non \u00e8 uno di quei libri che ti fa pensare \"diamine, ho sprecato 3 giorni della mia vita\", non penso di aver sprecato del tempo, forse, tornando indietro, deciderei comunque di leggerlo.Penso per\u00f2 che esistano un sacco di altri libri con cui spendere tempo prezioso, per cui risparmiate, investite su qualcos'altro e non fidatevi mai delle raccomandazioni sul retro della copertina."}, {"userName": "Judy & Marianne from Long and Short Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5126172-judy-marianne-from-long-and-short-reviews", "userReview": "Goal: Operate Cupcake shop Timeline: Seven Months Glitches: more than enough to count Can it be done? Hannah is about to open the doors to her little bakery. But things aren\u2019t going as smoothly as she\u2019d planned. There\u2019s more than a couple glitches. And then there\u2019s Alice. Talk about a lot to take in...this book certainly packs a punch. I have to admit, the blurb snagged me. I wanted to read about Hannah and her shop. What I got was a lot more. Roisin Meaney writes in a very frantic yet fluid style. There\u2019s a lot going on in this book. I laughed, I cried, I hoped for some characters to get together, some to break up, and others to just move on. From page one, I was totally involved in the story. I liked Hannah. She\u2019s realistic. She\u2019s got problems and not all the answers. I wanted to see her get her HEA, or at least for her shop to open and make her happy. The way she deals with life is something I want to read again and again. With that said, there are a lot of characters in this book. The dual plotlines, though intertwined, can be more than a little confusing. I found myself having to go back more than once to read and reread to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. I also found myself frustrated with more than one character\u2014but that\u2019s a good thing. It showed I was emotionally involved in the story. I didn\u2019t want this book to end.

I signed up for the website and requested one of their most popular books, since I've gotten a lot of not-so-good books on the free kindle book list lately, and didn't want to get burned again. I was very pleasantly surprised with this one.The story revolves around Hannah, a 30-something Irishwoman who has the brilliant idea to open up a cupcake shop in the middle of a recession. There are several other plotlines that spin off of Hannah, but she remains the heart of the story. The opening scene is one where Hannah's boyfriend dumps her, it comes out later for another woman who is pregnant with his child. After that, Hannah is on her own. Well, as \"on your own\" as you can be when your best (guy) friend moves in with you and your parents are about as perfect as you can wish. All of these people, and their bosses/siblings/parents have their own separate story. It sounds complicated, but the author does a great job of keeping everything straight, simple, and on-point.I won't go into details of the rest, but I will say that everything is resolved tidily (a must in these types of books) and I walked away feeling like I had just watched Love Actually, one of my favorite movies. The reason I love that movie, and this book, I suppose, is because the creators explore all different kinds of love, and the role it can play in your life. Overall a wonderful read, and perfect for the summer."}, {"userName": "Aislynn ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4156074-aislynn", "userReview": "Like the name this was a semi-sweet novel. It has it's ups and downs and isn't a cookie cutter sweet as pie romance.This contemporary romance is set in a small town, where everyone knows everyone. Nothing gets past the town gossips and everyone quickly knows who's to blame when something goes wrong. Poor Hannah is dumped by her boyfriend of over a year; he leaves her for his pregnant girlfriend.I quite liked Hannah as a character - she put her whole self into her shop. She took all her sadness, disappointment and threw herself into her baking and making herself a success. With her BFF Adam by her side, she is starting to get past the breakup and move on with her life. One of the many things I liked about Hannah is she was relate-able, she like most of us goes through a relationship mourning period - where we think that the world has ended because he's gone.How many of us have been through breakups and thrown ourselves into our work to help take our minds off things? Have BFF's who take our hand and help guide us through that bleak spot in our lives? This was something I liked about this book - I liked the realistic aspects of the story.I felt for Patrick's new girlfriend Leah and their situation. And I felt for all those involved with Nora and how much trouble she caused in general through out the story! I hoped for a better outcome for Alice and Tom. I don't want to give away too much or spoil how it all comes together!This all and all was a great quick read. I would recommend to anyone who likes chick-lit or contemporary romances."}], "description": "Hannah Robinson is just about to open the doors to her new shop Cupcakes on the Corner when out of the blue her boyfriend Patrick announces that he's leaving her for another woman.
