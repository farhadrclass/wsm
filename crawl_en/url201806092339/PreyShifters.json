He's a Stray, Ethan, not Wile E. Coyote!\u201dIt's rated 4 stars, like the others in the series, but it's the best of the first four. Maybe I should be more careful with rating books in the future.My other reviews show that I never liked Faythe much - she's abrasive, bitchy, vindictive, and kind of cocky, all turn offs. Here she tones it down some and I felt more heart than horror, which helped me read the plot through her point of view. I couldn't care much about the rekindling emphasis with Mark, but the main story is fascinating - they have to investigate why Mark has gone missing and who is doing a certain big-bad to strays in the area. Behind all that there's the convoluted politics her father and family keep fighting as they feel the power slipping through their paws.There's an uber sad scene in this one which surprised me. I admit some tears leaked out as life did. Didn't see it coming and the character was one of the best the series offered. The writer also decides, during the fourth book, to introduce a potential love triangle, which is usually done earlier on in a series. I'm not in the mood for a love triangle but considering the circumstances it's kind of forgivable right now.I couldn't imagine a shifter urban fantasy series that wasn't violent when violence is shown - the same can be said for this one. Vincent doesn't shy away from the carnage, well done action sequence fighting, and gory stuff when sadness splatters on page. There's not much tension but there's a sense of mystery and wondering what's going to pop up next. She's good at keeping the story going where you never know exactly where things will lead, throwing small plot wrenches into the story to keep it shaken up.I'm glad I stuck with this series. It's not perfect, I'm not star-struck by the main player, and shifters are one of my lesser liked paranormal buddies - but this is worth a read for the political infighting, surprised story-lines, and emotional slaps in the head."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3344685-sarah", "userReview": "1st Read - March 20102nd Read - August 2015Original ReviewThis is the 4th book in the Shifters series so it is very difficult to review without giving spoilers for previous books. If you're new to the series I strongly recommend you start reading from the beginning as this really is a series you need to read in order. I was already a massive fan of this series but I honestly think that this is the best book yet. There was so much going on & I literally couldn't put it down! Marc is in exile which is bad enough but when he goes missing Faythe is out of her mind with worry. Along with searching for Marc she has to deal with Manx's trial and Kaci's diminishing health as she is still refusing to shift. That's nothing compared to the political manoeuvres that Calvin Malone is putting into place to try and oust Faythe's father as the Alpha of the south-central Pride. If ever there was a character I wanted to climb into a book just to punch it would have to be Malone! Prey takes you on a complete emotional rollercoaster - it is the first book in a long time that actually made me cry. Parts of the book are absolutely heartbreaking and although at the time I was crying \"Noooooo\" and begging Rachel Vincent not to do it, I do think that what happened is going to have an important impact for the series. The plot is as even more action packed than I was expecting and the number of twists the story takes is incredible. We really do see Faythe start to grow up in this book. Without Marc to lean on she has to stand on her own 2 feet and I can see the makings of a great Alpha in her. She still isn't perfect and makes several mistakes but her character has come a long way since Stray. The book doesn't end on as much of a cliff-hanger as some of the previous books but don't let that make you think you won't be itching to get on with the rest of the series because you definitely will be. This really is a series that I can't praise highly enough - if you haven't already started reading it then you need to buy it now. I promise you won't regret it!________________________2nd ReadEven on a reread knowing exactly what was going to happen this book broke my heart & reduced me to tears! I guess that goes to show how invested I am in this world & the characters.I'm annoyed with Faythe for one particular mistake she made but I think it was kind of understandable considering the circumstances & she has definitely grown up a lot since the first book."}, {"userName": "Esra", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3552721-esra", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Pam Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15402332-pam-nelson", "userReview": "5 Prey Stars Hot damn these books just keep on getting better!

There is a lot of council business going down, and then there is a hella sad scene.

I enjoyed the mysetery of the stray toms and Marc, and I liked the technology angle. There were some great fight scenes - I especially loved the one where Faythe beat the heck out of Pete. I was even shocked when I read about the betrayal at the end of the story - maybe I was blind in this one, but I never saw it coming. There was a lot of action in this book which was balanced nicely with the already ongoing plot points.One thing about this book is that is gave me a reason to complain. I think this book was set up to cause angst, but it really just made me angry. The death of Ethan was heartbreaking. Not the actual death itself. I was upset, but at the same time, I saw it coming from the moment Jace brought kaci back to the ranch. The part that was a killer for me was when Greg and Karen were grieving their son. As a mother of two boys, this was just too easy to imagine.In the living room, Ethan lay on the sofa, his head hidden from sight by the armrest. Someone had tucked his arm at his side, and my mother sat on her knees in front of the couch, one hand stroking Ethan's hair back from his face.It was hard to read these scenes, but I admired Karen's attitude. After she left Ethan's body, it was a strong front she put on for the rest of the family. She was still upset and there were tears, but she became the steel backbone of her family, and I was in great admiration of this chracter.The fall-out from Ethan's death is what made me the angriest. Faythe is one stupid girl. She's gone from a spoiled, tabby princess to an enforcer that makes questionable decisions. Her union with Jace pissed me off like few fictional things have. Faythe was very close to Ethan. It was debilitating for her to lose him. But her actions following her death were despicable. When Faythe went to check on Jace, who had also just lost his BFF, I didn't think anything of it. Who hasn't had a drink, or four, in the midst of a stressful situation? I totally get that. But to have sex with Jace, in the house where Marc used to live, while Marc was fighting for his life, is unforgiveable to me. Marc was kidnapped, in part, because of Faythe's bad decision making skills. And I don't want to hear how she \"has feelings\" for Jace. Hello? She's thinking of Marc before and after her tryst with Jace. On page 255:We wanted them all back. Including Marc. I wouldn't be able to stand losing him so close to Ethan.On page 257, the Jace kissy-face begins. On page 261:\"We can't do this. I'm with Marc. I love Marc.\" And the real bitch was that I'd still love him even if he never forgave me for what I'd just done.Now, she has a connection with Jace. Puh-leeze! I don't care if she was drunk and grieving, there is no excuse for what she did with Jace. NONE. Marc has never wavered from Faythe. She has turned him down and broken his heart too many times to count, and yet he still wants Faythe and is loyal to her. It's time for Marc to man up. I don't think Marc should forgive Faythe. Who's to say she's not going to repeat these actions? Marc is the rock in this relationship. Faythe sways with the wind. It's not fair to Marc, and it's not fair to the Pride that Faythe wants so badly to lead. How is a struggle between Jace and Marc going to go over with the Pride? Not well, I would guess.Faythe wants her cake, and wants to eat it, too. No worries, Faythe, I'll take your cake off your hands, no problemo!"}, {"userName": "Buqet", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5306402-buqet", "userReview": "'Marc \u00f6lse bilirdim , bunu hissederdim...'Tek kelimeyle muhte\u015fem bir kitapt\u0131.

Mark missing, and Ethan! I loved Ethan so much! I was so sad when that happened, the ending was a shocker, I was not expecting that at all. I love all the action, and you see different sides of every character, and a good example of a majorly changed character would be Jace. He went from a fun to be around person to a serious possible alpha. The fight at the end got a little nasty but I wouldn't expect anything different. This was the best book out of them all because this book was the big change, it's where everything bad started, and everything that was good ended. Now the only thing left to do is fight for the good. Can't wait for Alpha to come out!

What really makes this book fantastic is the mixture of moments that just tear out your heart and the moments that make it beat about a mile a minute. Who needs skydiving when you've got Faythe and her fellow cats? That's enough of a kick to get any adrenaline junky bouncing around. I have to say, I loved Faythe in PREY. Sometimes series make me a little nervous because if they're really good, it becomes more difficult to keep that up for the next book. I liked Faythe when I discovered her in Stray, I found her captivating (and slightly addicting) in Rogue, and come Pride, I was totally hooked. I should have read PREY ages ago. Faythe was phenomenal in this book, leaving me twitchy to read the fifth book in the series, Shift. For some reason, Ms. Vincent's books have a different feel than many shapeshifter books. The mechanics of the shifting are made quite real to the reader and it's easy to pop down and really visualize what's going on in the story. Combine that with the honest and kick-butt nature of our heroine, Faythe, and you've got one series that I just adore. The other characteristic of Ms. Vincent's writing that makes PREY (and the entire series) a must-read? She's not afraid to write the hard stuff. She writes what she knows will make the series stellar and makes no apologies for it (okay, so she does actually apologize sometimes, but her plot developments, however much we may wish things had turned out differently, are completely necessary). She is a master of her craft and I hope to see her around for quite a while. I highly suggest this to any fans of paranormal fiction. Ms. Vincent is a master of shapeshifting action, creating stories that develop an addiction in her readers. Seriously - her writing is a drug!"}, {"userName": "Mrs.Vishous-Kattalakis-Belikov :::Para Itch Reviews:::", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4531338-mrs-vishous-kattalakis-belikov-para-itch-reviews", "userReview": "[are no more:( Faythe gave up the goods to Jace..OMG!

It seems like in every book Faythe is forced to grow up a little more and realize that the world does not revolve around her, like it has for so much of her life. This book is no different. She is living with the consequenses of her decisions from previous books, although not happy about it. The situation with Kaci is quickly approaching critical, and Manx is facing the trial. I think the outcome of Manx's trial is worse than if they would have put her to death. For what has happened to her, being made helpless and having to depend on other (mostly men) will be a hard pill to swallow. She does take the decision with grace, and I love the idea of her going to stay with Vic's family. While she could never replace Sara, her being there could help heal the wound. The inter political workings of the prides comes out in full force here. You really can't help but the hate Malone and his pride. It really seems like he is playing dirty, and while Greg and his crew is trying to take the high road they are forced into a situation where that just isn't possible. I found myself with tears running down my face during this scene and the ones to follow. Watching the family deal with the fallout was horrible. Faythe was once again faced with making some really tough decisions, ones that were for the good of the pride and not what she really wanted to do. She also made one really stupid choice, that I think will come back to bite her in the ass. I get the whole idea of comfort sex, and we have seen where she has done this before, but the person she picked could make things blow up bigger than ever. And how funny is it that it took one big loss and this for him to grow up and decide that he is in the race for her heart, and will do what ever it takes to win. Not sure what I think of that.I like resolution with Mark, because really at this point when war is coming fast, you really need all your assets to be working with you. I also liked the friendship with Dan Painter. It was funny to see. Mark was so used to having people around that it seemed like he was creating his own substitue pride while in exhile of his true one. I didn't see what was coming with Dan, and felt many of the same emotions that Faythe did.I can't wait for the next book, to see how the prides stack up and on who's side they are on, plus there is the bomb of the last page to see what happens."}, {"userName": "I \u2665 Bookie Nookie (bookienookiereviews.blogspot.com)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1488662-i-bookie-nookie-bookienookiereviews-blogspot-com", "userReview": "There was so much action-mystery-tension-adventure in this book...I was on edge roughly every other page. When I started this series, I was so torn between Jace and Marc. In the beginning, I was totally loving Jace as Faythe's potential mate. I loved his fun loving personality and the picture I have of him in my mind is totally yummy. Then, I liked Marc too--total Alpha material and I knew that for the future of the Pride, Faythe would have to choose a strong mate and that mate would be Marc over Jace based solely on dominance. Although my love for Jace never faded, I just didn't think he had it in him to stand up to and beside Faythe, therefore, I couldn't see love in their future. She needs a very strong male as her mate. As soon as Ethan died, I knew that would be the turning point for Jace and that he would become a frontrunner for Faythe's heart. I think he is showing more Alpha-like qualities and she is seeing that too. Having Marc back at the ranch will throw a monkey wrench in their budding romance, but will make things very interesting for sure. I am so torn between the two, but right now, I am rooting for Jace.As far as the plethora of other scenarios that continue to unfold...I am hooked! So many questions left unanswered. I can't wait until March for the next book. Oh and I have to say Daniel Painter--what a total disappointment. I was really rooting for the guy. Argh!! and Calvin Malone... What. A. Bastard. I really hate the guy. Then, the declawing of Manx was a complete shocker. Finally, I am super pumped that Angela is preggo--what a great thing that the Sanders will have a little living piece of Ethan.

For me Prey is the best book in the series, where we see the politics really starting to heat up causing all sorts of pain, heart break and death. It isn't only the politics that are heating up though, the love triangle Vincent has set up between Faythe, Marc and Jace suddenly gets really really complicated. Now, this is the one thing I don't like about these books, I hate love triangles, you always know exactly who the girl is going to go for and the whole thing always seems contrived. Honestly, although it didn't feel contrived to make pointless emotional stress, I still know exactly who Faythe will end up with and frankly I was far more interested in seeing what was going to happen next in the story than I was in Faythe's love life. Prey had me firmly in its grasp, it was one of those books you couldn't put down until you found out exactly what was going to happen next. And what happened next often landed me in tears, some of frustration and some of pure heartbreak, alot happens in this book that will reverberate all the way through to the end of the series. And more than that, it reverberated with me, you always know a good book when it touches on your emotions, which is exactly what Prey did to me.

Cal is ruthless and resorts to a lot of dirty tricks to get his way. Cal Malone won\u2019t rest until every tabby is declawed, powerless, pregnant, and married to one of his boys. Central to this problem is a dispute for control of the tabbies. Female werecats are rare in this world, and having a tabby in one\u2019s territory ensures that the species will continue to thrive.

Manx is on trial for killing the werecat that raped her. Kaci is weakening because she refuses to shift.This book was an emotional rollercoaster. I cried. I was devastated. I was angry. I wanted to sharpen my claws and rip Cal Malone to shreds. I felt despair at the Pride\u2019s situation. Greg Sanders is an incredibly complex character. When I first started reading this series, I often wondered why he would pick Faythe as a potential Alpha when he had other sons. I now see his wisdom, and his ability to play the game. Greg\u2019s only downfall is that he plays fair. Poor Faythe! She was put through the emotional wringer in this book.

I really do, but after \u201cthe tequila incident\u201d, he went into full on manipulation mode. Faythe was instantly regretting what happened, even before the condom was off. Jace saw that, sensed the looming loss & rejection, and used it against her own pain and humiliation to force false feelings and reactions. Obviously, I understand Jace did just lose his brother/best friend/other half and has harbored feelings for Faythe, probably for forever, but Faythe has always been Marc\u2019s. The only time she ever wavered was when she was pissed off or rebelling\u2026or both.

The Wonder-Twins. *sniff*In killing off Ethan, she has almost killed the character of Jace. One of the reasons I loved him so much was his youth and spunk. I liked that for Faythe because I thought it fit her personality better than Marc.Marc always comes across as old and father-like instead of boyfriend-like. That being said, I still feel for Marc.

She can churn out a page-turner like nobody's business. And, really, with the way she tends to end each novel on a spectacular cliffhanger, I appreciate how close together Mira has released the last two. Installment number five, Shift Shifters 5, is due out in just one month and so I'm particularly glad I waited awhile to read PREY as the end of this one left me even more bereft than the last. A feat I didn't think was actually possible considering the consequences surrounding that ending. I had heard rumors of darkness swirling their way through the internets in regards to this volume and that probably contributed a little bit to my rather unusual willingness to wait as I was afraid of who would be hurt this time and by whom.Faythe is counting down the hours. Since one of the conditions of her acquittal was Marc's banishment to the neutral territory, she's been on pins and needles worrying about his safety, relying on infrequent telephone calls to reassure her of his continued wellbeing. And when she's not fretting over Marc, she's busy playing nursemaid to the Sanders' newest refugee. Kaci refuses to shift and allow her body to heal and become one with its werecat self. But she worships Faythe and so it's our girl's job to convince the young girl that all won't go to hell in a hand basket if she lets her guard down long enough to shift. There is also the matter of Manx's trial and the political machinations to do with the sudden presence of another rogue female and the role of female werecats in general within the strictly patriarchal werecat community. So when Marc goes missing and packs of strays are seen prowling the neutral territory, Faythe, her brothers, and all her father's enforcers are on a mission to get to the root of these mysteriously linked events.I'm happy to confirm that the hints of maturation and resolve we saw in Faythe throughout Pride Shifters 3 are all present and accounted for in PREY. She's very intent on the important things in this book. She hasn't lost sight of them and she is aware, in a way I don't think she ever has been in the past, of how her actions and her past affect her present and, more importantly, her future. I have always liked Faythe. But I liked her most of all this time around. Better than any of the other characters, in fact, which is saying something as I am kind of a fan of Marc. And Jace, too. But I loved how dogged she was about finding Marc and fulfilling her obligations to her father and Kaci, even to Manx's little son. That said, I would be remiss if I did not note the elephant in the room in PREY. A sense of inescapable doom hangs over this story and I had the distinct feeling that that horrible thing you're afraid will happen the entire time would not actually take place, and then, just when you think it's safe to let out that breath you've been holding, the equally but different horrible thing you're not thinking of would bash you over the head. And I was spot on. When it comes it deals a direct blow and from that moment on things are messy and painful and very, very conflicting. I finished completely unsure of how I felt, torn over what went down in the end. And nothing is going to help me figure it out but reading Shift Shifters 5 and seeing how Ms. Vincent chooses to let the chips fall. I'll just be over here crossing my fingers they don't fall the way I'm afraid they will."}, {"userName": "Teresa Mary Rose", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6054096-teresa-mary-rose", "userReview": "More Reviews Here: Readers Live A Thousand LivesThis series just gets better and better. Each book ramps up the action and you know it is all leading to something huge. At the same time though, each book has its own distinct storyline so you aren\u2019t left hanging. I\u2019m left wanting more but not without resolution. Prey was a great addition to the series and I cannot wait to make time to finish these books.Faythe is such a great heroine. She is so strong and feisty and witty. I love her determination and how she will go to extreme lengths for those she loves. In a society that tries to keep women down, I love watching Faythe shine and prove them wrong at every single turn. Of course she made some decisions that made me want to shake her- but that\u2019s Faythe. She isn\u2019t Faythe is she isn\u2019t making me crazy every few minutes.It\u2019s not a spoiler since it\u2019s in the synopsis, but Marc goes missing in this one and oh how I missed him so! Everything always seems to be stacked against him and Faythe, but it is very clear that they love each other. The world seriously needs to cut them a break. This book makes it very clear how much Faythe cares for Marc because she will do anything for him. Like I said though, I really missed him so he better be in the next book much more.Not only does Faythe have to deal with a missing Marc, but now she is also responsible for Kaci, the thirteen year old werecat they found in the last book. Faythe basically has a mini-her to contend with and she is realizing just how difficult she can be. But she loves Kaci and will do anything to protect her but she can only help Kaci if Kaci is willing to help herself. Then something happens that changes her pride forever and well Faythe has a lot to deal with.In my review of Pride, I mentioned that I didn\u2019t see the love triangle between Marc and Jace and well now I have to take that back because it became pretty damn prevalent in this one and that does not make me happy. It\u2019s not a bad love triangle and its done well but I just love Marc so I\u2019m not feeling Jace trying to steal Faythe\u2019s affections. I love Jace and he is great but--- MARC!!!Not only do we have a missing Marc and bratty teenagers, but we also have political drama between the prides and it really starts to get out of control in Prey. Everyone is out for blood and I know something terrible is coming in Shift. Prey is a great addition to the series. It is action packed and has twists and turns all over. With a kickass female lead and tons of drama, you can\u2019t go wrong with this series."}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2084265-joanne", "userReview": "I cannot even begin to explain to you just how amazing this book is! I love this series; as you read through the story arc, each book gets better than the last, but knowing that didn\u2019t prepare me in any way for just how incredible Prey is!In Prey, Faythe has to deal with heartbreak after heartbreak. How Faythe managed to deal with all the things that happened to her, I don\u2019t know. I was in floods of tears at several points while reading this book. So unbearably sad, I can\u2019t tell you.We see Faythe at her strongest in Prey; her determination and unwavering resolve can only be admired when she does what she believes is right, even though the outlook is far worse than bad. But we also see Faythe being weak, in a way that\u2019s going to change everything from this point onwards. But you can\u2019t help but to agree with or understand her each and every action throughout Prey. She is most definitely a force to be reckoned with, just amazing.All the characters we love are back, but things get a hell of a lot more serious for them all. There are a lot less laughs, and a lot more anger. Politically, things for the South Central Pride take a huge turn for the worse, and everyone is running on all cylinders to keep the ship sailing through the storm that is Calvin Malone. That nasty git really digs in his claws and refuses to let go. Oh, how I would love to belt him one!The plot is just unbelievable; not only is Prey incredibly sad and tugs at the heartstrings, but it also has a storyline that is true to form for the Shifters series, full of action, danger, and adrenalin, and one that keeps you guessing right to the end. How Rachel is able to create such involved storylines, and make them so fast paced, exciting, and powerful is something to be in awe of. Rachel is one fantastic writer!I could go on and on about how truly awesome this book is, and how awe-inspiring Rachel is for creating such a wonderful series, but so much goes on in this novel, I\u2019m at risk of spoiling the book in a big way. If there\u2019s just one series you have to read in your lifetime, Rachel Vincent\u2019s Shifters series is it. I couldn\u2019t recommend these books to you more if I tried. Make this your Shifters year. I can\u2019t wait for when Shift is released on 1st March."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2938528-kim", "userReview": "I cannot begin to explain how emotional 'Prey' was. My heart didn't stop racing the entire time I was reading and I found myself crying so often. Rachel Vincent's characters have captured my heart and attention so deeply. I'm stuck in a supernatural world unlike others I've read in so long. 'Prey' was such an intense book. I keep thinking the series can't affect me emotionally any more than the previous book, but 'Prey' was way more intense than 'Pride'. 'Prey' is full of emotional and physical pain, the usual mystery and action (which makes every story more interesting) and as always, it ties up loose ends only to create new problems that need solving. I was curious to see Manx's fate determined, though the decision itself was less than ideal and Dan Painter showing up again was an unexpected side to the story, I know he was looking forward to joining the Pride and it was interesting to see his efforts to get there.My heart was breaking during every incident and fight that Faythe and her Pride had to face. In the past, Faythe's been an intricate part of the problems and it was nice to see that she wasn't the direct cause of trouble this time around. However, I can see that won't last long as her actions are certainly going to rock the boat in the next books. I hate that Marc keeps being put through so much, he hasn't had an easy life and it doesn't look like he'll get to relax any time soon. I'm disappointed with some of the decisions Faythe and others made in 'Prey', despite what the circumstances were, but I hope they can be fixed in the future; especially in the romance/relationship area. I'm in awe of how well structured the Prides are in the series. While all decisions are placed in the power of the Territorial Council, which we've seen in previous books, the secret political moves happening within the Prides are so well formed that you're captivated and shocked by the betrayal they display. In an ideal world you'd hope for all the drama and fighting to end. Fortunately for all the book-action addicts out there (like me) there's no way these Pride disagreements are going to end peacefully. Addicted Faythe and Marc. Can't wait to see what happens to them next.5/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Laura Lulu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1648704-laura-lulu", "userReview": "***SPOILERS AHEAD***I didn't like this one as much as I liked the first 3 books in this series. They were all 4\u2605 for me. I think I'm just not a fan of love triangles. I prefer books where there's the long drawn out sexual tension with one character instead of the triangle. It just made me so uncomfortable when her & Jace hooked up while Marc was missing. Yes, I can do without Marc's temper, but shit, she has put that man through hell. And just when she finally decides she loves him and wants to be with him, needs to be with him, he gets werecat-napped.And wow, isn't it wonderful timing that Jace, the perpetual goofy guy, the one who lives for a good time and no one takes seriously, is now exhibiting alpha tendencies and stepping up? It really bugged me. And I really like Jace. Who I hate half the time is Faythe. I listened to the audiobook, and I noticed that Faythe is always asking rhetorical \"why does this happen to me?\" kind of questions. I noticed this because every time she does it, I found myself yelling in my car \"because you're a selfish bitch!\"But yeah, her & Jace really made me uncomfortable. Or I should say, Faythe made me uncomfortable concerning Jace. The second half of the book was full of all of Faythe's stupid and annoying play by play of her body's reactions when Jace as much as sneezes at her. Tingles, shocks & shivers. Oh my! My fave was when they knew where Marc was and were finally going in for him. Jace goes to protest something and she puts her finger to his lips to shush him for all of a couple seconds. And then of course her finger was warm & tingly from touching his lips or some crap like that.Four books in, and I am STILL having a hard time liking Faythe. She is just sooooo self-centered, but because she's a rare princess tabby, it's allowed, and I hate that.But back to the triangle--I think I just hate the triangles because one of them is going to be hurt, badly. And also because I can never fully get a book crush on a dude because I don't want to pick the loser and be disappointed. :)"}, {"userName": "Christen (GoldiloxReads and Whimsify)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4652961-christen-goldiloxreads-and-whimsify", "userReview": "This is the five star worthy installment in this series that I've been waiting for! There is A LOT going on in this book!Prey begins with Faythe and a group of enforcers on their way to Manx's hearing. They make a pit stop along the way to visit the recently exiled Marc in his new home and get ambushed by a large group of stray werecats. Pretty unusual, and suspicious, for strays to gather in such a big group. Then Marc goes missing...yes, I said missing! Marc mysterious disappearance fuels the plot for most of the book as Faythe goes all out to solve the mystery of what the strays are up to and find Marc. I say that the search for Marc fuels most, and not all, of the book's plot because, as mentioned above, there is a lot happening in this book! There are two HUGE surprises - one that had my jaw hitting my chest and my copy of Prey almost taking a flight across the room. This one is so much more emotional than previous books, and I know - that's hard to say. The level of emotion here was off the charts. For the middle 100 pages my stomach was tied in a huge knot. The ongoing feud between Faythe's pride and Calvin Malone, Alpha of another werecat Pride, continues to escalate in this book as well. That guy really irks me and he is no less outrageous in this one. The side story going on between Faythe's father, the Alpha, and Malone is a nice addition. I like when a series has an ongoing plot that carries throughout the books to tie them together. This series just keeps getting more intense! I love the dramatic build up that is happening from book to book, as well as Vincent's change in scenery for each of them. I cannot wait to see what happens in the next in the series, since this one definitely sets up some plot points that will continue in Shift."}, {"userName": "Jen (The Starry-Eyed Revue)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4659650-jen-the-starry-eyed-revue", "userReview": "[That scene with Jace was way hotter than the steamiest encounter she's had with Marc all through the series.
