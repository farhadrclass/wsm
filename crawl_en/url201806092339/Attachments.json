(Sidenote: After my first re-read, this may not be my favorite Rainbow Rowell book anymore? I still love it beyond reason, but I think she's just matured so much as an author, Carry On or Fangirl might overtake it when I get to them. I guess we'll see!)February 2013: Falling in love with a book is exactly like falling in love with a person. In both cases, most of the time you just can\u2019t help yourself, and what happens during the falling is almost entirely out of your control. This is an especially appropriate metaphor to be making when talking about Rainbow Rowell\u2019s delightful little book, Attachments, which is about a man falling in love in a very inappropriate way. This is what I wrote on Goodreads approximately one minute and thirty-one seconds after finishing the last page at 2 AM on Saturday night:\u201cFUCKING HELL, MAN. Why is this so . . . GUH . . . and it\u2019s the middle of the night and I\u2019M SO ALONE.\u201dI believe that sentence and my five star rating should speak for itself, but I would like to elaborate anyway because when you fall in love with something you want to tell everybody about it as loudly and in as many ways as possible.Attachments takes place in 1999, just before the turn of the millennium and all the madness of Y2K (remember Y2K? It was like practice for the Mayan apocalypse!). Twenty-eight year old perpetual student Lincoln is fresh off his latest graduate degree and is stuck in a rut in basically every area of his life: he lives with his mother, he has no foreseeable career objectives (he can\u2019t even figure out what it is that he might be good at), he has no social life to speak of excepting Saturday night games of D&D with his lifelong friends, and he hasn\u2019t even attempted a romantic relationship since his heart was smashed into pieces eight years before by the girl he thought he\u2019d be with forever.As the novel opens, Lincoln has just taken a job in a Nebraska newspaper\u2019s IT department where he is in charge of the newly developed email security program that monitors employee\u2019s email accounts for inappropriate usage. It\u2019s a bit of a creepy job reading other people\u2019s emails and sending them warnings, not to mention tedious and boring, but it\u2019s at least a job. He spends most of his time reading books and doing other non work-related activities. That is, until he accidentally becomes wrapped up in the correspondence of two employees, film critic Beth and copyeditor Jennifer, who are smart and funny and who little by little begin treating their work email accounts as a personal chat service. After about the fourth or fifth flagged conversation, Lincoln realizes it\u2019s too late to send them a warning and with not a little guilt begins looking forward to each flagged email, especially when it becomes clear to him that not only is he developing feelings for Beth, but she has a little crush on him as well. The only problem is, if he wants to be with her, how can he do so knowing that he\u2019s just spent a ridiculous amount of time violating her personal privacy?The novel is a mix between Lincoln\u2019s 3rd person POV and a delightful modern epistolary confection consisting of Jennifer and Beth\u2019s increasingly personal emails to one another. Jennifer and Beth are immediately very likeable. Their conversations with one another are funny and warm and occasionally sort of surprisingly heart-rending. That they were so likeable is key, because the novel wouldn\u2019t have worked if we as readers were not able to overcome the basic creepiness of Lincoln\u2019s actions. We want Lincoln to keep reading about Jennifer and Beth because WE want to keep reading about Jennifer and Beth. His actions as Rowell writes them, while a bit icky, are also completely understandable. There\u2019s also the fact that Lincoln himself is a wonderful character, and I quickly found myself wishing he was real because I have been looking for him all my life. But it\u2019s not only that he\u2019s likeable. His struggles as an aimless and confused young adult unsure of what he wanted to do with himself was one I could relate to in very specific ways. The sharp wit of Rowell\u2019s dialogue and prose doesn\u2019t hurt, either. This was also the perfect time period to set this book. The transition from tradition to technology at the newspaper echoes Lincoln\u2019s own stumbling transition to adulthood.This is probably not a book many other readers will give five stars to, but it hit all of my personal buttons in all the right ways. Like, to the point where I was all, Rainbow Rowell, either get out of my head or be my best friend. But even if you don\u2019t fall crazy in love and over-identify with it like I did, it\u2019s still worth checking out as the perfect example of this kind of romancey, character-driven novel. It\u2019s well-written, funny, has great characters, and is overall a super-fun read. If you like good romantic comedies like When Harry Met Sally and Love, Actually, just imagine that this is like a book version of that and you\u2019ll have a pretty good idea. I am now eagerly anticipating the two (!) books Rainbow Rowell is publishing later this year."}, {"userName": "Lilyan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4455835-lilyan", "userReview": "CONTAINS SPOILERS  This book would have been sooo much better if not for the pathetic characters. Meet Lincoln:A 29 year old nerd who has multiple degrees, lives with his mom, plays dungeons and dragons on the weekend, is cripplingly awkward and hasn't been able to get over his high school sweetheart breakup for the past NINE years.... BUT WAIT! LINCOLN ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THIS:Ya.... I don't get it either. Lincoln works as an internet cop. He snoops through people's emails and web histories, to make sure no one is slacking off during work... welcome to the 90's.Obviously, this is not the funnest job in the world; which is how Lincoln ends up amusing himself by reading the explicit emails between coworkers and friends, Beth & Jennifer.Jennifer is infinitely terrified of getting pregnant, yet she possibly wants to since Mitch, her husband, wants a baby. When she finally does get pregnant she whines about it all the time but you can tell deep down she's happy. It's like the girl that complains all the time about this one guy who keeps flirting with her although she will encourage him and is enjoying the attention. Just shut up and stop being bitter and lying to yourself. Beth on the other hand, has been dating an intense and flaky musician for the past 9 years. She's dying to get married and have kids. However, Chris, the B.F. is not interested. Que some more female whining. Lincoln falls for Beth through the emails she sends to Jen, although he's never met her. We follow the characters through their pathetic lives and how they all get over themselves, grow some balls and make life changing decisions... finally. It's a cute idea which was executed poorly in my opinion. The characters did not have to be disgustingly weak. I did enjoy Beth and Jen's emails. They were witty and amusing. I also admire the author's decision of attempting a Chick Lit. from a man's POV. We have countless of Chick Lit's starring pathetic females. In this one we have a pathetic male instead.

He was INTO IT. He was acting like it was some deep, deep rock anthem that TOUCHED HIS SOUL. Air acoustic guitar was involved. I did what any normal person would do: studiously avoided eye contact and went directly back to my desk to email my work best friend about it.Actual email excerpt: Me: I just got \"I will be your hero, baby\"-ed by tech support. Friend: I'm pretty sure HR frowns on that.Me: I'm pretty sure they frown on any mention of trembling.Friend: But do they know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw them away? Me: Do they know? Do they know? Do they know? Do they?And then we watched this video ten times and laughed until we forgot how much our jobs suck. Ahem. ANYWAYS. As you might guess, I thought this book was so freaking charming! It's based in the late 90s and told from the perspective of Lincoln, who starts off the book leading a pretty pathetic, lonely existence. He has no social interaction that doesn't involve his mother or Dungeons and Dragons. He left a majority of his self-esteem sprinkled across the countryside on the long just-been-dumped-by-the-love-of-his-life bus ride home from college. He works the IT security night shift at the local newspaper, has no social skills and basically walks around in a beige, directionless haze. But then, Beth and Jennifer's email chains get flagged in his security filters and Lincoln is immediately drawn to their infectious personalities. They are lively and funny and Lincoln is charmed. Instead of sending them a warning letter as dictated by company policy, Lincoln continues to read the emails and quickly becomes invested in their lives, unable to resist the bright spot they create in his otherwise tedious, mind-numbingly boring job. Things get even more complicated when he finds himself falling for Beth. Of course this is a huge invasion of privacy, but never underestimate the potential for trouble-making and bad decisions with hours of bored free time in an unfulfilling job. Just scrolling through my sent box in my email I see subject lines of: \"My Cubicle is Draining My Life Force\", \"Data Entry: Totally Worth All of That Student Loan Debt!\", \"Is Liking Three Songs in a Row on the Lite Rock Less Talk Station a Sign of Stockholm Syndrome?\" so I definitely empathized with some of Lincoln's life and job frustrations. But my favorite part of this book by far (besides the swoonage of course) was Beth and Jennifer's relationship. I couldn't blame Lincoln for being so charmed---I was charmed! They were awesome and a perfect representation of the wonderfulness of BFFs. I loved them. Oh, and I realized if I had a mysteriously hot guy in my office that unbeknownst to me could read my emails, he'd have enough for a restraining order within the week. I admire Beth and Jennifer's restraint. In closing: this book is so cute. It gave me a happy buzz the whole way through. Thank you Maggie for steering me to it!

Twenty days and seventeen books into 2012 and I've finally, finally found something I can honestly say I loved. I knew it was going to be good from the very first chapter (which I promptly read to my mother while we both laughed). Giving it five stars might be a bit much, but I can't help it. This was funny, engaging, sweet, and, more importantly, smart. None of the characters were perfect, but they were written so realistically that their flaws added to their appeal. It felt like reading about real people, not the cliche's of people one normally gets in a piece of modern fiction. The premise is pretty basic; Lincoln is a shy and socially awkward individual who never quite got over the heartbreak caused by his high school sweetheart. Having recently moved back to his hometown (and back into his overindulgent mother's house), he gets an IT security job at the local paper. His job involves reading through flagged email and sending out warnings to anyone in the office who breaks company rules regarding internet use. When he starts getting flagged emails between Beth and Jennifer, he knows he should send them a warning and move on, but he can't seem to bring himself to do it. Before he knows it, he's read so many of their conversations that he feels like a total creep, but he still can't bring himself to stop. It's when he begins to fall for Beth, however, that Lincoln's torture truly begins. Told from a third-person perspective with Lincoln at center stage, we only get to know Beth and Jennifer through their emails to each other. While this is often a difficult method for an author to use to truly portray a character (especially since people only project a certain amount of themselves to others, especially through emails), Rainbow Rowell managed to really make it work. I felt like I really got to know Beth and Jennifer through their emails, and for the first time in too long, I can actually understand why the male protagonist fell in love with the female. Beth and Jennifer are genuinely good people, devoted friends, and beautifully flawed individuals. We see Jennifer's fears about becoming a mother are caused by her rocky relationship with her own mother. We see Beth's ignorance regarding the myriad ways love can manifest and exist. We see Lincoln's insecurities unfold as he attempts to struggle out from beneath his mother's apron and live his own life. While the underlying theme is romance, the story also focuses on family, friends, and personal growth. I know this makes Attachments sound paralyzingly dull, so you'll just have to trust me when I say it's really quite funny. It's probably the funniest book I've read in the last few years. I understand it's probably not for everyone. The pop culture quotes and nerdly references to things like Dungeons & Dragons and The Lord of the Rings might put some readers off, but they were right up my alley. I read the entire book in one sitting, neither needing nor wanting a break.

I don\u2019t know who is more pathetic: characters leading pathetic lives or the reader who loved reading about these characters. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the latter although I could care less about what this says of me because I just inexplicably adore this novel. Many may disagree but I think the premise of this novel is completely original and IMO, the most creative plot yet in the four books of Ms. Rowell I have already read. Just a peek at the plot: Set in the Year 1999, Lincoln has everything a 28 year old dude needs. He\u2019s smart, cute, funny, earns a lot of money (didn\u2019t mean for that to rhyme) but he has no sense of direction, completely aimless, a wanderer. He absolutely has no idea what to do with his life which is the reason he still lives with his mom. He lands a most unrewarding job, an internet security for a newspaper company and has to read to censure inappropriate e-messages sent by employees but instead of reproaching Jennifer and Beth for sending hilarious personal e-mails to each other, he starts enjoying their stories and here begins the cutest story/ies, some of which will end up being romantic but totally ship-worhty ! <3 It doesn\u2019t have the most exciting introduction so for those who started this and decided not to finish because the beginning seemed dull, I suggest you give it another chance because if you read on, you will get to read genuine stories of the characters that feel so real, I feel like I could be one of them. The authenticity of their situation and dialogues that perfectly harmonize with the story\u2019s setting made the novel completely adorable. It's at par with romantic 90s movies I adore like \u201cWhile You Were Sleeping\u201d, \u201cOnly You\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d.

I wish I was made up of enough faith and romanticism and cotton candy and rainbows to buy into this book, or at least suspend my own version of reality for long enough to enjoy it fully. But alas, I\u2019m a cynic with a 3.1 average rating. Swoony romance is just not how I roll.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...You have to concede to some big-ass, brand-name concepts if you wanna enjoy this book. Chief among them? True love and love at first sight. The Big Two, as I call them.But we\u2019ll get there. That doesn\u2019t really come into play until the end. And before that, we get hundreds of pages of fun with some great characters!Wow. Warning sign to self: when genuine enthusiasm sounds sarcastic, you may need to check your pessimism. Yikes.So: the year is 1999. We follow Lincoln, a guy in his late twenties whose appearance is described as a mid-twentieth-century interpretation of the Hulk with Jason Bateman\u2019s face.No, that\u2019s not a joke. I wish I was funny enough to make that up.Anyway, at the beginning of the book, Lincoln is still in love with his high school girlfriend, lives with his mom, has no social encounters but for Dungeons & Dragons games, and works nights reading people\u2019s emails at a newspaper. But, as Justin points out, my boy Linc is still hot enough to inspire obsession in the hearts of no small number of coworkers.Lincoln\u2019s life is pretty boring, but I didn\u2019t mind, most of the time. He\u2019s pretty funny and smart and shy and nice - all around adorkable. A real Zooey Deschanel. (Just kidding, he\u2019s not a manic pixie dream boy...oh my god wait is he a manic pixie dream boy?! He does enjoy profound conversations about modern romance with strangers at bars and sheet sets with violets on them for the prettiness of it\u2026)F*ck, I can\u2019t like ANYTHING! I need to stop thinking about this. Let\u2019s talk about Beth.Beth doesn\u2019t really understand how emailing on a business account works, and thus sends a metric sh*t ton of personal emails back and forth with her BFF Jennifer. They, like, always contain cursing or ~sex lingo~ or something, so her emails always get flagged. And guess where they end up?You got it.With OUR BOY LINCOLN.(Living to forget my previous Lincoln realization!!! Manic pixie dream? More like manic pixie nightmare!) (Oh, wow, you guys, I just got word. I\u2019m officially now the funniest person on Earth.) Anyway, instead of sending Beth a warning message, or at least not reading her mail anymore, Lincoln keeps on keepin\u2019 on (all up in that inbox). UNTIL HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH BETH!!!! Can you believe it? Gives me the heebie-jeebies.Well, not until. He keeps reading them. Keeps on lovin\u2019 from afar. Creepily walking past her cubicle. Fixing her not-broken mouse. Attending her boyfriend\u2019s concerts. Etc, etc. It\u2019s all a mess, really.But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself! Beth is super cool. She\u2019s really funny, and a great friend, and has what Lincoln refers to as a job straight out of a romantic comedy (ironic, no?): movie reviewer for a newspaper. Aw. It\u2019s sad to think about the job of a current-day Beth being at risk, as newspapers continue to underperform. That seriously wasn\u2019t even funny. What the hell is wrong with me? I think I\u2019m severely thrown off by my mixed feelings on this book.Okay. Here\u2019s the deal. Lincoln knows everything about Beth. How she met her boyfriend, what their life together is like, her interests, her job, her family members\u2019 names, plus everything about her best friend Jennifer. ALL BETH KNOWS ABOUT LINCOLN IS HIS APPEARANCE!!! And, later on, the fact that he\u2019s been reading her emails and grossly invading her privacy for months.But this doesn\u2019t stop Beth\u2019s reaction to seeing Lincoln again being a full-on makeout session in a movie theater.Again, Lincoln knows so much about Beth, an impossible amount, enough to lead to this lovely quote:\u201cHe knew why he wanted to kiss her. Because she was beautiful. And before that, because she was kind. And before that, because she was smart and funny. Because she was exactly the right kind of smart and funny. Because he could imagine taking a long trip with her without ever getting bored. Because whenever he saw something new and interesting, or new and ridiculous, he always wondered what she'd have to say about it--how many stars she'd give it and why.\u201d And I love that quote, I really do. I went so far as to grant it a coveted spot on my Goodreads quotes list. All my best friendships are some sort of version of that (minus the kissing part, obviously, and the implications of non-platonic attraction) and I\u2019d assume a strong relationship is, too. (No, I\u2019m not that into the concept of relationships. Can you believe it? I come off so sentimentally in reviews!)So essentially, what you have to buy into here - what Rainbow Rowell has Beth ask you to buy into - is that Beth\u2019s love for Lincoln (\u201clove at first sight\u201d) is equal to Lincoln\u2019s love for Beth (\u201clove before first sight\u201d). Or at least allow for them to be on the same playing field. (Did I sport talk right?)But I\u2019m not into it. See, Lincoln\u2019s love for Beth blossoms like the world\u2019s creepiest flower, but it\u2019s PURE AS ALL GET OUT. It\u2019s entirely based upon her personality. He\u2019s never seen the gal! Hers is all, \u201cI saw a cute guy at work and now I\u2019m obsessed with him and I tried to follow him home.\u201d NOT. THE. SAME.The ending was just bananas gushy and mushy and cheesy and excessive. I cringed really hard throughout it (excluding the lovely quote above, which stood out like a Mindy Kaling book in a sea of John Green.) (This is a new expression I\u2019m trying to popularize instead of \u201cdiamond in the rough.\u201d)On top of that, there were traces of general women hating and a bit of slut shaming in here, which sucked. Rainbow Rowell tends to be woke as hell, so that was a disappointment.Bottom line: I didn\u2019t hate this book. There were some parts I hated, yes, but also some parts I liked a lot. So I don\u2019t not recommend it.

Over the course of the book we learn: Beth has a Sandman poster, She quotes Field of Dreams deeper than \"If you build it\", She made a LOTR reference that I didn't catch, She referenced The movie Heathers, and had an astute observation on Julia Roberts[(Chap 9- page 38ish)at this point I was fully hooked].

Her characters always feel vibrant, energetic, quirky, and rich in emotion. \"Attachments\" follows a shy, socially-awkward, (he loves playing Dungeon & Dragons) deeply insecure 28 year-old named Lincoln. Lincoln still loves at home with his mom, and works at a job he absolutely despises (his job is to read/filter his co-workers emails). Without giving away too much of the plot, I will say that Lincoln grows tremendously though out the course of this novel. I also like that \"Attachments\" takes place in the late '90s. I love all the pop culture references, and the casual but hilarious banter of Jennifer and Beth's daily emails. Rowell's writing and sense of humor is simple and refreshing but never feels flat or monotone. Her novels ALWAYS make me smile which is really saying something because I'm such a jaded person when it comes to matters of the heart. This book is cute, cute, cute! I highly recommend it.

From a thousand miles away. There\u2019s nothing you could become that I haven\u2019t already fallen in love with.\u201dIt's always fun reading Rainbow Rowell's books. It's not, that her novels are extraordinary or incredibly good (apart from  Fangirl  that is), but Rowell always makes me feel comfortable and cozy. That's the reason I love her books so much. Attachments  remined me a lot of  Landline . The setting, the characters, the character's jobs and this communication through e-mail/telephone thing. Rowell is an expert of writing sassy and funny conversations, that never get boring. I think this is one of the main things that make this novel(or all of them) so lovely.The one thing that bothered me is that it took Lincoln and Beth so (sooooooooooo) long to meet. I would have enjoyed to see more of their relationship.Anyway, I loved it.

She's phenomenal! For me, it comes to one key point: she builds real people. Her characters don't feel like characters, they don't feel fake or made up. They're really people with unique quirks and imperfections and beauty and it's so easy to be sucked into reading her books because I feel like I actually know these people!This book, particularly, was cute and lovely. I thought the mails back and forth were hilarious and adorable and I thought that Lincoln''s maturing was really well done. The reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because I really wanted Lincoln and Beth to meet earlier .. I don't feel that I got enough cute time between the two of them! There were also a few periods in the book where I would have liked things to move along bait more quickly!"}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin", "userReview": "**Rainbow to Justin** Hi, Justin. I'm Rainbow Rowell. You may recognize my name because it shows up on your Goodreads update feed on, like, every other line or so. I've written popular novels for young adults and regular adults as well like Eleanor and Park, Fangirl....**Justin to Rainbow** ...Landline, Carry On, yeah yeah yeah. People love your books, but I don't know if they're really my thing. I mean, aren't they like Nicholas Sparks books that have more wit and biting humor? Are guys even supposed to be reading this stuff?**Rainbow to Justin** Justin, everyone is supposed to read my books, and everyone IS reading my books except you. You are seriously the last person left on the planet who confidently refers to himself as a quote unquote reader who hasn't read anything I've written. When are you going to get off of your high horse and join the rest of the world? What makes you so special?**Justin to Rainbow** You know, I was just scrolling through my Overdrive app and your first book is available right now. I'll read that one. I'll read it. Fine. But, I'll be honest, just by reading the synopsis I can tell where this is going. You're so predictable, Rainbow Rowell. **Rainbow to Justin** That's my first book, Attachments. That's not even my best one. I've gotten so much better as a writer since 2011, but I guess you gotta start somewhere. It's also written from a male perspective so that should help since you're a male. You already have one thing in common with my protagonist, Lincoln.............................................**Justin to Rainbow** Sorry I've been away for a few days. I, uh... I couldn't put your book down. I just kept reading and reading because all of the chapters were so short and the story sucked me in with its Catcher in the Rye meets every John Green book meets.... yeah, the end was a little smushy. Is smushy a word? It means too rom-com, a little too unbelievable-but-works-out-perfectly, you know? And can we talk about Lincoln for a second? Rainbow, come on.... he works night shift reading emails, lives at home, can't get over his high school girlfriend, but he's... gorgeous? That's your cute guy? That kind of stuff bugged me at times, but I didn't really get caught up in the details as much because of the story. You did a nice job creating vibrant characters with a fantastic 1990s setting. Blockbuster? Sega Genesis? Hahahaha... Oh man, that stuff took me back. You crafted a very fun story even if it wasn't the best ending in the world. I guess you can say I'm now....**Rainbow to Justin** A Rainbow Rowell fan? I've already got your copy of Eleanor and Park in the mail.**Justin to Rainbow** Gee, thanks Rainbow. You're the best!"}, {"userName": "BookLover", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12285159-booklover", "userReview": "Re-read in 2017 - sigh, nothing new to add here, except, this book gets better and better with each readRe-read in 2016 - this book, an all-time favourite, was just what I needed this week!!! Loved it just as much this time around. Every word was perfection. sigh!**Original review 04/24/15**Oh, my poor heart, how I loved this book. How is it possible that Rainbow Rowell, no matter who the character is, no matter what the storyline, can get inside and make me feel every minute of her stories? What a fantastic storyteller!This was such a unique story, told in a unique way. Throughout the story, we get to read email correspondence between best friends Beth and Jennifer as well as read all about Lincoln, the IT guy hired to read company emails flagged for inappropriate use. It was set in 1999/2000, which totally brought me back to that time in my life. I, too, was working for a newspaper around that time and email was a relatively new thing in the workplace. I think I would have died of embarrassment if anyone had been reading any of the emails send back and forth between my friends and I during that time. How naive we were back then with no concept of big brother and the digital trail left behind with our correspondence.This was a sweet story with great characters. I was able to get a real picture of who Beth and Jennifer were through their emails. Their friendship was funny and heartwarming.\n\u201cBeth to Jennifer - My Cute Guy has a kid.Can you believe it? A kid! And probably a wife, too. How could he do this to me?Jennifer to Beth- ???Beth to Jennifer- My thoughts exactly.Jennifer to Beth- What I meant by that was: give me the information that you have and I don't--that is making you talk like a crazy person.\u201d\nLincoln, true to Rainbow's typical writing style, is a perfect hero. I loved him. I loved his desire to find a place in this world, his friendship with Doris, his relationship with his D&D friends (which I found endlessly amusing) and his ability to surprise me in his quest to fit in.\n\u201cTroy has been dragging your unconscious dwarf on an earth sled, just to keep you in the campaign. You're a constant drain on his magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe brought the house down during 1999 charades with a two-minute, completely silent reenactment of The Sixth Sense. \"When you mimed the ring falling on the ground,\" Chuck said, applauding, \"I forgot that I already knew you were dead.\u201d\nI really liked the interaction between Lincoln and his sister Eve.\n\u201cSo, what if, instead of thinking about solving your whole life, you just think about adding additional good things. One at a time. Just let your pile of good things grow.\"\"This is investment advice, isn't it? You're personal-banking me.\" \nI have to specially call out to a secondary character in the book, Justin (Lincoln's friend), who stole every scene he was in with his foul language and over the top attitude:\n\"He forgot to take the price tag off, so Justin called him \"Minnie-fucking-Pearl\" and \"XXLT\" all night\"\n\n\u201cWell, all right. Let me change into something I can afford for Dena to puke on, and then we'll get this motherfucker started.\u201d\n\n\u201cLINCOLN! DUDE! YOU'RE alive!\"\"Justin, hey.\"\"Sorry to call you at work, but I've been calling your house so much, your mom probably thinks I'm trying to get into her pants. I feel like I haven't seen you since the sixth grade.\u201d\nI am predicting this book will fall into my list of favourites that I reread every year.

Horribly boring. I literally fell asleep twice while listening to this and missed about 5 chapters, but I couldn't be bothered to rewind and listen to what I missed. The entire premise is creepy and voyeuristic, and I didn't agree with their relationship. I love Rainbow's writing, but this one was my least favorite of hers. It definitely doesn't compare to her newer releases. Overall, I did not enjoy this very much at all, but it did provide a twinge of humor and lighthearted dialogue."}, {"userName": "Mohamed Al", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2014", "userURL":

It's not my favorite of Rainbow Rowell's books but it had her same flair and addicting story.I loved Lincoln! He's definitely on my list of favorite male protagonists. The only problem I had with it was the pacing. The middle dragged quite a bit, but by the time I got to the end I felt things were wrapped up very well.Overall, I definitely recommend checking out this book.

Straight into my favourites for the year :)- So this is one of Rainbow Rowell's adult novels - before this one I had read Eleanor and Park (5*) and Fangirl (4*). I would now say that Attachments has taken the top spot for my favourite Rowell novel - I enjoyed it immensely and have since recommended it to many of my friends.- So this story follows a guy named Lincoln who works in IT - Lincoln's job is to monitor the emails of all of the employees at his workplace (he also works at night - ha). Not long into the job the emails of two women in particular keep getting flagged by the system, so when an email gets flagged it is Lincoln's job to read it and send a warning (employees are not meant to use their work emails for personal conversations). But a problem arises when Lincoln not only neglects to send a warning - he inherently seeks out the emails of these women and reads them most nights. He becomes wrapped up in their lives and feels like he knows them - that sounds really creepy but it's actually quite sweet! Completely to Lincoln's surprise he begins to have feelings for one of the women - although he has never actually met her!- This was such an adorable story. When I read the blurb I thought it was going to be some weirdly creepy story of some guy stalking women via their emails BUT it's so much more that than (and only a wee bit creepy ha). This book had me in stiches - it was so incredibly funny and just my type of humour. When Lincoln is reading the emails of the two women we actually have the emails set out on the page which made for a very enjoyable reading experience. I found myself rooting for Lincoln and hoping everything turned out okay. I have not laughed this much at a book in a very long time! The quick wit in the emails of the women reminded me so much of the way I speak with my girl friends - so I could really envisage the events of this book happening.- 5 out of 5 stars and into my favourites for the year! Definitely at the top of my Rainbow Rowell collection now - I have just got my hands on Landline so I look forward to sharing my thoughts once I have read it."}, {"userName": "Stacee", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7359586-stacee", "userReview": "2017: Yep, still perfection. I love it more than I could say. This was just perfection. I adored the premise and the format it was written in was phenomenal. I LOVED that we got into Lincoln's head and only knew Beth and Jennifer in the same way Lincoln did.Beth is the sort of friend I want to have. I want to hang out and get drunk and probably arrested with her. She's smart as hell, quick with a comeback and hilarious. Lincoln is sweet and every descriptive word that Beth and Jennifer use for him is correct. He's heartbroken at first, but it's clear that he knows how to bring the swoon.

HE'S A FUCKING CREEP THAT'S WHO HE IS. i honestly wished when everything comes out she'll just go to police and get a restraining order. that's not fucking cute and romantic, that's downright CREEPY.im not even going to talk about the characters but i can say that Lincoln is the dullest fucking main character. he's almost 30, he lives with his mom, he has like 3 friends who he almost never talks with, he plays D&D on weekends. he really reminds me of all those serial-killers-before-they-started-killing-people situations. but he looks like adonis so being a creepy piece of shit is okay i guess!!!!sadly, there is a happy end. i still think it would make more sense if the main character killed the girl or something because it reads EXACTLY like serial killer origin.moreover:\n\n\u201cAre you retarded?\u201d\u201cI thought you stopped saying \u2018retarded\u2019 and \u2018gay\u2019 so that your kids wouldn\u2019t pick it up.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it. That\u2019s how retarded you sound right now. Why would you think that? And why would you refer to it as moving back home? You never moved out.\u201d\n\nyikes\n\nOne time, he\u2019d had to rebuild a hard drive up in Advertising; it\u2019d taken a few hours, and the next day, when Lincoln went to put on his sweatshirt, it still smelled like Drakkar Noir. No wonder my mom thinks I\u2019m gay.\n\ndouble yikes\n\nThen I see this huge shadow of a person walking toward me, and all I can think is, \u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t rape me because I\u2019m supposed to wait six weeks before having intercourse.\u201d\n\ntriple yikes\n\nThey all wanted \u201csmoky eyes\u201d\u2014\u201cyou know, like Helen Hunt at the Oscars.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure that my sister Gwen and I are the only ones who won\u2019t look like domestic abuse victims in the wedding pictures.\n\nY I K E Sfuck everything about this book.anyway, this confirms that the only valid book of rainbow rowell is Carry On (and it's a harry potter fanfic smh). this book is trash and im giving it one star and i would give it less if i could. this is not a healthy relationship, this is a stalkery creepy shit.~~~reading this for the game im participating in"}, {"userName": "\u2618Misericordia\u2618  \u26a1\u03df\u26a1\u03df\u26a1\u26c8   \u2742\u2764\u2763", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia", "userReview": "I really loved how tenderly the author weaned Lincoln from his self-imposed isolation.

Now, I still read, but I don\u2019t mind going out to a cafe or a library to read around people. After all, people watching is so much fun.When I realized that half of the novel was going to be in e-mail format, I got worried. Again, I never had good experiences with reading through a texting or email format, and I wasn\u2019t expecting a good outcome from this one either. Thankfully, Rowell proved me wrong! I felt like I knew Beth and Jennifer, even though I was only learning about them through cyberspace. So this was great, because it made me believe that Lincoln actually fell in love with Beth, \u2018cause she grew on me, too. Jennifer and Beth were just hilarious and oh-so real.Overall, I like how once Beth found out Lincoln had been reading her e-mails (and had undoubtedly told Jennifer), and Jennifer had been super against it and had wanted to turn him in. That made this novel more realistic than it already was, because that would\u2019ve been me - so I like how Rowell made her characters believable and didn\u2019t make them all agree with one another. Even Jennifer with her whole fear of pregnancy is totally me. Oh, oh, and I\u2019m glad Lincoln never met up with Sam after they ran into one another. It showed how much he\u2019d grown; that he\u2019d finally gotten over her. \u2019Cause lets be honest, she wasn\u2019t too nice of a person.So yeah, it was a fun read. Good job, Rowell. I might just have to read all your other books!"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "[by a different character (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jonathan Ashleigh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33737465-jonathan-ashleigh", "userReview": "While entertaining, this novel lacked a lot. It seemed too easy and even though the main character was believable as a good guy, he was not someone anybody would want to date or be friends with. I appreciated the reality that was felt when the emails printed but had a much better time with The Sorrows of Young Mike which printed instant messenger conversations between people who I liked. John Zelazny built an awesome take on modern epistolary fiction when he parodied The Sorrows of Young Werther."}], "description": "\"Hi, I'm the guy who reads your e-mail, and also, I love you...\"Beth Fremont and Jennifer Scribner-Snyder know that somebody is monitoring their work e-mail.
