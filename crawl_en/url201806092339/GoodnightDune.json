Still, with only a rudimentary idea of what Dune is about, and, guiltily, never having read the original Goodnight Moon, this is a great little story for the future sci-fi fanatic in your family...or, the grownup sci-fi kid in all of us, staring at the valleys of the moon on a clear summer's night, or launching silver toy rockets under the noonday sun: and in each case, mouthing, \"Cooooool...\""}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237469-miriam", "userReview": "http://goodnightdune.com/index.html"}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1671713-natalie", "userReview": "Julia Yu's Goodnight Dune is an inspired illustrated parody of the omni-present Goodnight Moon that accompanies seemingly every American gift giving occasion for babies, toddlers, and new parents.

The drawings are exactly what I'd expect a children's Dune to look like and there are a ton of little references hidden throughout.

I'm too tired to dissect it right now, but it was just off enough to actually bother me. On the other hand, this might be the best that such a parody can be. Also, another perfectly reasonable complaint is that dark orange text on dark grey is hard to read. With picture books, these design elements are important."}, {"userName": "Opranks", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48989393-opranks", "userReview": "Really Goodhttp://opranks.com/"}, {"userName": "Vim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3268103-vim", "userReview": "This book would've been good if I read the Dune series.
