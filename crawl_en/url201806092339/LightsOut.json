This book does not come close. Lights Out and many of it's contemporaries all suffer from serious problems. First and foremost is the fact that the authors are all working from the same playbook. An EMP strike hits, a few people who are prepared take charge as society collapses. Then, when their communities are at rock bottom the super hero survivalists help them survive and teach people how to sustain life when there are no modern conveniences any longer. Crawford and his contemporaries turn their 'works of fiction' into survival manuals more than novels. In this book the characters are flat and predictable. Stereotypes are all over the place. It's quite apparent from Page One who the hero is. The truth is that David Crawford is an average writer. He does not have much talent. That is apparent from page one as well. There is very little insight, thought or description in Lights Out. The creativity is limited. He essentially took a stock EMP/End of the World plot, added his own characters and that was all. He should have wrote a survival manual instead of a novel. As far as the message of the book goes, I agree with it. I'm a conservative, not a bleeding heart liberal. My thoughts and issues have to do with the writing style, etc."}, {"userName": "Nathanael Coyne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2376002-nathanael-coyne", "userReview": "First of all, let me be clear. This book is poorly written. Whilst an improvement on the original free PDF version, the edited and published version is clumsy and tedious to read. It's very methodical and linear following a he said, then she replied then he thought and he said formula. That said, the level of detail is also one of the book's strengths. There are no large chronological or situational gaps. The author has thought of everything and done a great job of juggling such. Another thing I liked about this book is that is points out that a SHTF scenario is not like flicking a switch, even when it is something as dramatic as a countrwide blackout caused by high-atmospheric nuclear detonations resulting in an EMP that fries electronics in the air and on the ground. Even then, it takes several weeks for things to really break down, and the characters in this book to varying degrees either leap ahead or drag behind in adjusting to the social and economical collapse. One of the most important issues especially for American and the survivalist crowd is regarding the use of firearms. Murder is still illegal regardless of whether the world is as it is today or whether it has all gone to shit. Doesn't matter if there is no law enforcement around to either protect or arrest you. At what point during that slide into collapse do you make the switch from your current attitude to the carrying and use of firearms to where you're cruising around town with all passengers (the \"good\" guys) armed with AK semi-automatic assault rifles? I think the author was a little optimistic about people adjusting post-SHTF and recognising the impact and what needs to be done. There was the occasional character who protested but I think in a real situation the general rule would be that people would want to carry on pretending like things aren't that bad, that they would be seriously unhappy with barbed wire fences being erected and holes being dug in their front lawn. So think of this worse case scenario fictional account as the best case response and believe that people would be far more sheep-like and sluggish to react to the signs."}, {"userName": "Terry James", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7203823-terry-james", "userReview": "This book is an interesting look into the potentially not-to-distant future of America. It takes place in rural San Antonio, TX and follows 'the hero', Mark, as he, his family, and his community battle all the obstacles one would encounter if suddenly the lights go out and there is no more electricity. Because the book is a bit optimistic and sometimes too coincidental, it's better read as a fictional story with all the archetypes present and a definite storyline with designated plot points, rather than a survival study. Although there is lot's of information and sometimes the reader is left thinking of possibilities in real life, it is more of fictional thriller that will quench the thirst of the post-apocalyptic junkies.The author shows his knowledge in the decay of American society and politics while also bringing a survival perspective. He goes a bit into the government's attempted control and seems to brings his own theories as far as FEMA camps and martial law goes, which may scare the reader of potential future outcomes. Crawford also seems to have extensive weapons knowledge and throughout the book his gun advocacy seems transparent. Overall, I really enjoyed the book and finished it surprisingly within a week and a half. It is a bit heavy at 600 small print pages, but reads extremely easily and almost every chapter finishes with a cliffhanger making you want to continue on and on and never put it down. There are quite a few spelling/printing errors, and the dialog is a bit 'he said, she said', but otherwise the author gives you quite the entertaining piece!"}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4439292-jeanette", "userReview": "Man was that a long book. It really reminded me of One Second Later and that's probably why I picked it to read. It had a lot of thought provoking things in it. Opens your eyes to what might happen if something did seriously put the US out of business for a while. The only issue I had was the rambling on about weapons and attack scenes. As a girl (one not particularly interested in these things) I ended up skimming some of the more technical scenes. He went here, she went there, they had this FAL or that AK gun. Too many details for me. Otherwise it was a good read."}, {"userName": "Samantha Blair", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3338596-samantha-blair", "userReview": "This was kind of an odd read. The basic plot was pretty good. It's a journey through what it might be like to experience an EMP, and many of the individual scenarios were inventive and exciting, if a little unrealistic. However, the whole thing comes off a little bit like the expression of the conservative male ego. I had trouble getting past the blatant moral messages. We get the feeling that if you go to church, love your wife and kids, scare your daughter's boyfriends off with a shotgun, listen to everything that old war veterans say, work hard, save your money, and love your guns, you will be the ultimate hero despite the fact that you don't really have any leadership experience, skills, or appropriate preparations.It's not that I didn't like it. It was an entertaining enough book, but it's really about an expression of individual heroism more than a community experience or post apocalyptic vision."}, {"userName": "Daniel Reyes", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4652794-daniel-reyes", "userReview": "Definitely one of the best books I have read this year, and that is saying quite a bit since I'm very picky about them. The story is quite believable, even without an explanation of how The Burst happened (no spoilers here, as you'll find out what it is on the second chapter). The story is gripping and has a nice incremental pace to the action, with a well presented and explained sequence of events; at no point was I feeling that there was something I couldn't explain as the logical course of events.If you like survival apocalypse type novels, then this is definitely a book for you."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090700-christina", "userReview": "The writing is often amateurish, but the ideas are solid and well thought out, and I liked that most of the characters were regular folks, with normal names and personalities. I found it superior to One Second After, which also deals with the aftermath of an EMP strike over the United States, but in a more hackneyed and sentimental way than Lights Out. Let me put it this way: I'm tempted to take notes. I never would have thought of bleach!"}, {"userName": "Bonnie Calhoun", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5587021-bonnie-calhoun", "userReview": "Very impressive story! I'd say this is a great man's read. I enjoyed it immensely because I like stories like this rich in detail. At 600 pages it is chock full of information about weapons (all sorts of guns, ammo and such), cars and what models and how to fix them to make them run, fighting tactics, and general survival techniques.This guy (who wrote it) REALLY did his homework on how to make things work after an EMP. There is a slight bit of romance...not an actual thread but woven in, but it's more of a character sketch of the main protagonist Mark. I'll tell you! Amid the murder and mayhem, the writer David Crawford made me laugh out loud more than once! Just the way he had Mark thinking and talking at times was laugh out loud funny. The snark really was perfect as a tension reliever.I gave it a 5-star because of the supreme amount of data and research contained in it...and the story was well done too! I would have liked a little more at the end, but I think that's just because after 600 pages I wasn't ready to let go of the characters. I let some of the cheesy dialogue get a pass because the rest of the book was so well done, and I wouldn't want someone to miss it because of that.Well done!"}, {"userName": "Linda B.D.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10965449-linda-b-d", "userReview": "Wow, what an amazing book! No trilogy or tons of more books to buy, thank goodness. It was really a great read- all in one book. The U.S. has no electrical power. The story does not go into depth about why there's no power, but that doesn't matter because the story is so good that you don't care \"why\". It concentrates on a small community that struggles to survive against gangs and traitors. At first I was concerned that it had a lot of characters. It had the perfect amount. Some you love and others you will despise. The author did an amazing job with character development. Each person or family was clearly described, that I could visualize them. I could not help but compare this to the book, \"One Second\". Both books had similar scenarios, but this book seemed to be the more true version of what would happen if an EMP took out the electrical grid in the U.S. This was much more realistic. Yes, there would be gangs combing homes, killing, and looting, but entire cities doing that? No. This book simply a great realistic point of view. I would recommend this to everyone. My opinion: it is a five star read. A huge thank you to David Crawford, author of this wonderfully written book."}, {"userName": "Kami Donnelly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7996631-kami-donnelly", "userReview": "Ok, in regards to writing, this is no piece of literature that will go down with time as a classic, the writing is pretty straight forward. There are a few things that border on unrealistic or just to coincidental in regards to plot points. That being said, this is an excellent book in detailing various What Ifs in the case of a SHTF scenario written in a narrative format. You are presented with several things that may happen if things went south fast and how to prepare for them, as well as considerations to take in case something like this could happen. I think the most important lesson this book might teach is the importance of networking in an end of world scenario. If you are interested in prepping or have a functional zombie plan, you would enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "Ethan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1771951-ethan", "userReview": "Poorly edited, misspellings, and at times, thoroughly cheesy dialogue. And yet, I am still giving it 4 stars. In fact, if the few things I mentioned were fixed, I'd bump it to 5 stars.This book drew me in and I really got invested in the welfare of the people in it. It started me thinking about a lot that I need to do to be prepared for a disaster. I have some basics put together but there is a lot more I could have in place, even if it what I face is just a few days after a natural disaster and not the major events that this book describes.A recommended read for anyone who wants to consider what could happen if the lights really did go out."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2159834-dan", "userReview": "I just finished this book and I really enjoyed it. I didn't know what to expect out of it since the author is somewhat of an amateur. But, I think he did a good job. The story line was compelling and the characters were great. The book seemed fairly realistic and portrayed a very real possible scenario of what would happen after an EMP. The book was very informative and I actually learned a few prepping tips and tricks. Just like \"Once Second After\" I found myself evaluating my own preps. Any good prepper novel should do that."}, {"userName": "Kirk McElroy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13588170-kirk-mcelroy", "userReview": "I loved this book. It was very entertaining, considering it is a day to day account. There were times I couldn't put the book down because I couldn't wait to see how the karate man was going to keep his group together. On the same account the hate I would have toward the other characters, would keep me up late just hoping to read that he was dismembered horribly. A bit longer read than I would usually take on but found myself hoping it would keep going."}, {"userName": "Chris Holly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5797635-chris-holly", "userReview": "An excellent read. David Crawford, an excellent contributor to A15.com, started this novel on another website, honed it and grew it and added to it. It was universally loved by those who ask those kinds of questions that get a strange look or a funny eye, questions like \"What if the electricity went out and we had to live with it out for a while? How would we live? And could life be worthwhile?\" I love this book because it confronts the nature of man and the reality one would face dealing with the thin veneer draped over humanity being rudely ripped away. As a society, we think that we are always going to be able to find safety and resources when we need them. This book details the trials and travails of Silver Hills, Texas and the experience of Mark \"Karate Man\" Turner and his family and friends while they deal with the destruction of society when the electricity mysteriously goes out. The original draft of the book, which still circulates on the internet, finds the origin of the incident with a Islamic extremist, launching nuclear weapons to effect a nuclear effect over the entire United States called \"Electromagnetic Pulse\". This is a real possibility and many don't realize that this could be achieved tomorrow with a single nuclear weapon left over from the Cold War or a rogue nation like North Korea, launched from a barge off the coast of the United States.Mark is a nice guy, an accountant who jockeys a desk. When the lights go out, he is forced to transition regarding such luxuries as computers, running vehicles and air conditioning. Then the worries are food and water. Then, as the situation wears on, it is basic security. The story ranges through the experience of the citizens of Silver Hills getting together and making an oasis of livability despite the society around them crumbling. As people are rioting and killing each other for food and batteries, they are creating committees and creating a solution to improve their safety. They fight off invaders, help others and bind the county together. Then, the residents of Silver Hills face an enemy from within that tests their abilities to live in the brave new world they find themselves.All in all, a great story with an element of warning. The charecters are well developed and fleshed out. Mr. Crawford is able to paint a picture of post-Apocalyptic America that hits home and makes the reader consider significantly what would happen if the comfort of internet, air-conditioned life were to disappear, how would one react and how would others around react? Outstanding work!"}, {"userName": "Kyle Pratt", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16666180-kyle-pratt", "userReview": "When an Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP) destroys the power grid, this intriguing novel begins. Mark Turner is at work in the San Antonio area when the Burst, as it is called in the novel, sends the nation into chaos. Telephones, and most radios go silent, late model cars die, planes fall from the sky. Government struggles to maintain order and provide relief, but in the cities, society quickly breaks down. The novel follows Mark, his friend Jim Davis and a growing community of family and friends as they work feverishly to protect themselves and their families while civilization unravels around them.Lights Out has been downloaded from the internet in PDF format over three million times. It is now available in a 600-page paperback edition and on Amazon.com in Kindle format where it is selling well.The author, David Crawford, states in his bio that he resides in San Antonio and is \u201can avid outdoorsman who likes to hunt, fish, hike, off-road, and shoot,\u201d and that he is a black belt in Karate. There is definitely something of David Crawford in the character of Mark Turner.Most reviews that are critical of the book fault the writing and that is what compelled me to give it four stars. However, the EMP threat is so real and compelling I can forgive some bad editing (that will hopefully be corrected in latter editions) and the expository telling, instead of showing, through much of the story. Others, who see the novel as simply as an action novel might be quicker to fault technique.The novel is a warning. (In the embedded interview you will hear) Crawford states he wrote the book, \u201cto try to get people to prepare.\u201d The novel does stir thinking and discussion. Could it happen? What would we do? Are we ready?My wife and I read Lights Out at the same time. I thought the book compared favorably to One Second After. Lights Out had the better story, but One Second After had the better writing. My wife felt Lights Out was the better novel on both counts. We agree that Lights Out is a realistic, thought-provoking post-apocalyptic novel. Four stars out of five for Lights Out."}, {"userName": "Khornberger", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2677480-khornberger", "userReview": "David Crawford's Lights Out is a fictionalized work about a magnetic disaster which kills the electrical power for the entire United States plus additional countries. The main character, Mark quickly invites friends and family to stay with his family in a rural area to make it through the unknown amount of time they will endure the lack of electricity. It becomes evident that the electricity will not be restored and Mark and his friend Jim must weigh whether to accept an invitation into a compound which has been developed for survival of this type of disaster. The decisions are interesting and survival becomes more and more difficult illustrated by stories of horrible events such as gang activity, riots, and worse. It is a really interesting and plausible story. It was difficult for me to like Mark at first, and I think that it was just a result of awkward character development; as the plot thickened it was easier to forgive Mark for his personality and the author developed more of Mark's human attributes later on in the story. Although there are themes of good v. evil and importance of community, I am left reeling with knowledge that an event such as the fictionalized one presented in this story would end poorly for so many people."}, {"userName": "Regina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1290231-regina", "userReview": "This is a \"what if\" book. What if the lights went out and it took years for them to go back on? What would happen to our society? Very thought provoking about how people will survive and the desperate measures to get the basic necessities of life. This book had a lot of great info about being prepared in a worst case scenario. Sometimes a little extreme in my opinion. I gave it 4 stars because there was a lot of language that could have been left out. It also went into such great detail about guns and the ammo. and then the fighting that went on and on. Definately written from a man's point of view.

Yes, it started off as an Internet narrative story that was put into book form. It does have a few rough edges as a result. I did not find these nearly as distracting as some readers did. I found this story to be gripping and immersive right from the start. This is the story of several people who end up banding together and creating a community as civilization falls apart in the aftermath of an Electro Magnetic Pulse attack on the United States. This is a very real threat and the consequences would be disastrous. Several people with various survival skills put together a fortified town and deal with the rise of gangs and of having to deal with the growing breakdown of civil order. People had to learn to grow food and defend themselves. The characters are well developed and I cared about their fate. I found the ending to be very satisfying.As is also true of the novel ONE SECOND AFTER, this story presents a very compelling portrait of what could happen and what the consequences would be.
