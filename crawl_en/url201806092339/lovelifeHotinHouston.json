These sisters are hot and RICH! The family lives quite a life. I loved the story line and the story lines between all the various characters. I don't want to say too much for fear of giving too much away but it was definitely a great read!! I was happy, angry, and sad, I cried a few times, both happy and sad tears. There is so great, hot sex scenes in this book, so if you're not into that sort of thing, maybe steer clear, but if you are into it, this is a must read!!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca Nolan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4833487-rebecca-nolan", "userReview": "Love/life\u2026well what can I say besides this book was one of the most entertaining and enjoyable indie reads I've had in a long time. The sisters are wealthy, fun and vibrant. Jasen and Adrienna might have two different mothers but that hasn't stopped them from forming a close sister bond. It is very easy to become attached to these pair.This book might have graphic sexual content but that doesn't take away from the story. I was captivated by the characters. Just a wonderful read! I have even got a copy for my best friend!"}, {"userName": "Danielle Zwissler", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5998353-danielle-zwissler", "userReview": "The Hawthorn sisters are hot. These two rich girls come from the same family--sort of. Jasen- daughter of Maggie and Jay, the sensible one, afraid to screw up her own life, mainly because of the disaster of her parents. And her sister, Adrienna the daughter of Jay and Victoria... Minutes apart, these sisters were close as any two girls from different mothers would be. They love to shop, live life, and have fun. This story is about their lives, sex, and about family. It's hard to review this book without giving too much away, so I just recommend that you read if for yourself. You will love it."}, {"userName": "Sean", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13540980-sean", "userReview": "I have no idea how this is actually available to buy as a hard copy.I only read half of this after my sister finished it as it is usually the type of books she loves, she doesn't have a goodreads, and even she thought it was terrible.The writing is almost childish at times, as if it was written by a 15 year old staying up late at night writing fan fiction. The characters are wholly unbelievable and the plot is hysterically laughable.I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads.1/10"}, {"userName": "Leslie aka StoreyBook Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272944-leslie-aka-storeybook-reviews", "userReview": "Good book, good interplay between the characters. Had me rooting for some and booing others. warning fairly graphic language and sex scenes...in case you aren't into that kind of thing."}, {"userName": "Majanka", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3167071-majanka", "userReview": "Love/Life: Hot in Houston reminded me of Gossip Girl. The main characters are two rich heiresses who are actually half-sisters, but they tend to get along well enough to forget that little fact. There is intelligent, clear-minded Jasen and intuitive, passionate Adrienna. Sometimes it seems like they\u2019re miles apart, both in space and in thought, but they\u2019re the best of friends. They have all the money in the world, only have to bother about gossip, going out, partying and hanging out with their equally-rich and equally-influential friends. However, their life isn\u2019t as carefree as it appears at first.The sisters\u2019 dialogue is natural and flows easily, and fits them well for their age. Sometimes they came across as too self-confident, even cocky, though. But I figured that matched their personalities and heritage, and besides, not all main characters need to have the same characteristics and to have a cocky, almost arrogant lead for once is a nice change.There was a little bit of mystery, which I enjoyed reading. The romance was the key-point of the novel though, and it worked well. Both Jasen and Adrienna are torn when it comes to love, and they must each go through their own journey to find out who they truly belong with. There were some hot and heavy scenes, but I enjoyed reading them. The author managed to get the point across without appearing too crude, and the language was appropriate for the scene. It was very 18+ though, so keep the minors away from this book.I enjoyed the characters, but felt like there could\u2019ve been a bit more depth to them. The plot was enjoyable as well, but again I would\u2019ve liked it a bit more complicated and fleshed-out.That aside though, I liked this book and it was a pleasant, quick read for me. It\u2019s an ideal summer read (even though we\u2019re as far away from summer as it gets, but this is the kind of book I\u2019d enjoy reading on the beach or on the porch late on a hot summer evening). But even in winter, it\u2019s a nice read to get away from the dark, depressing days ahead for a short period. It\u2019s light, fun, humorous and entertaining."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13069606-ellen", "userReview": "Read like a cheap soap opera."}], "description": "The Hawthorne sisters have it all: beauty, wealth and all of the trappings of high society Houston.
