Warm \u2013 Endearing - Amusing \u2013 Honest: \u201cPenny From Heaven.\u201d Set in 1953 New York, it\u2019s historically insightful and feel-good nostalgic. Jennifer Holm, inspired by her own American/Italian family, wrote this for a middle school audience. However, young and old alike will find this coming-of-age story a delight to read. And following the story in the author's notes, Holm includes the connections to her family, as well as many eye-opening facts about the era and Italian/American culture.\u201cSchool is out, and for the first time in months. I don\u2019t have to worry about Veronica Goodman being mean to me. I used to like school, until this year. I probably wouldn't have survived if Mrs. Ellenburg, the librarian hadn't let me hide out in the library. Lucky for me, Veronica Goodman doesn't like to read.\u201dEleven-year-old Penny is a hoot! Her humor and philosophical musings had me in stitches. She loves the New York \"Bum\" Dodgers (yes, the Dodgers were in Brooklyn before LA), and listens to all their games on the radio with her grumpy/deaf grandfather or with her favorite uncle who lives in his car. She loves butter pecan ice cream and Scarlett O\u2019Hara the aging family dog. And she\u2019s fond of both sides of her family, but she gets quite annoyed with their inability to come together. Why can\u2019t everybody just get along? And why can\u2019t anyone give her a straight answer about her father? When you\u2019re eleven, there always seems to be more questions than adults are willing to answer. Where\u2019s the honesty in that? Then when a near tragic event occurs, honesty finally spills forth like pennies from heaven.

HolmPublished by Random House2006Historical FictionJennifer Holm has taken her personal family history and crafted an excellent work of historical fiction in Penny From Heaven. Holm's book is funny, moving, and a joy to read. Incoming sixth graders, girls especially, will have a hard time putting it down. The writing is quick and smart and the characters are round and very dynamic. This, in addition to the vignette style chapters that comprise Penny's summer make for a page turner of substance.The book follows Penny and her family throughout the summer of 1953. She lives with her mother, grandmother and grandfather, since her father died when she was young. She still remains close to her fathers large Italian family and is always being encouraged to eat more by them. Penny is an 11 year old like many other; she likes baseball, ice cream, a special boy, her dog, family and getting into trouble. She dislikes: mean girls from school, not being allowed to go to the swimming pool, her grandmother's cooking and her mother's new boyfriend. Penny has a lot of fun working in her Uncle's store and playing with her cousin over the summer, but this all comes to an abrupt end after a serious injury. Throughout the novel, Penny learns more about her family, the past and eventually looks towards a new future.This book has laugh out loud moments balanced expertly with real emotion and sadness as well. Holm grabs her readers with detailed and thoughtful writing and runs them through the gamit of feelings one experiences as an 11 year old and a 22 year old as well (from my own experience). Every time Penny mentioned how awful her Me-me's cooking (and it was often) was I laughed. Writing in the first person, one really gets to know Penny and how smart, funny and thoughtful she is. A great scene is when Mr. Mulligan the milkman, her mother's new beau comes to dinner. Penny makes sure to make him squirm, giving him a large helping of Me-me's infamous peas and onions, \"Mr. Mulligan, would you care for some peas and onions?\" I ask in a sweet voice\" (134). While there are funny moments, there are also extremely touching moments, especially while Penny is in the hospital. She learns the truth of her father's death and grapples with serious issues like death, prejudice, forgiveness and her mother falling in love again. Penny from Heaven is a book that has such a wide range of events and feelings, but never seems crowded or over done. I think this will allow for every reader to grab on to at least one theme, character or event that they can relate to. For me, I found myself relating a lot to Penny's loss of a pet and her first crush. Though set in a different time period, the themes and emotions certainly transcend time."}, {"userName": "Peter Panic", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/344061-peter-panic", "userReview": "For some ungodly reason I keep reading Newberry books.

While it contained one of the three elements that secretly qualified it for what is ALWAYS ine a Newberry book (war) it wasn't that interesting and frankly the 50-isms would go over kids heads.

Penny is orphaned by her father from the time she was a baby. Throughout the novel, 11 year-old Penny struggles with many questions about her father, whom no one will speak about. Thus, this leaves her questioning her own identity as well. While Penny lives with her mother and her \u201cboring old American\u201d grandparents, Me-me and Pop-pop, her life is consistently filled with her enormous, loud, and \u201ctypical\u201d Italian family. She visits them often, as they live nearby, and they treat her like a princess. Penny also spends her days with her mischievous and trouble-making cousin Frankie. Yet, throughout the novel, several important events occur in the protagonist\u2019s life. While still dealing with the unspeakable and tragic death of her husband, Penny\u2019s hard-working mother attempts to normalize her life, by going out with the girls and dating men, specifically, Mr. Mulligan, the neighborhood milkman. This predictably bothers Penny to no end. Additionally, she develops a crush on a boy and is left-out by many of the girls at school. However, her relationship with her family seems to be the priority in Penny\u2019s life. A tragic event uncovers family secrets, and in the end brings them all together again. Holmes did a fantastic job at portraying what life was like for a pre-teen girl during this time period. Her realistic and authentic manner in which she depicts life for this young girl and many Italians is remarkable. Small insertions, like the family\u2019s fear to speak Italian in public, the love of the baseball team the Dodgers, or the fear of contracting Polio make this a very believable work of historical fiction. Yet, the manner in which the family communicates with each other and raw emotion all appeal to the novel\u2019s literary and narrative elements. The book was inspired on her family\u2019s own story and based on her mother\u2019s real life experiences. This book is geared toward middle school aged students. The prior knowledge that a reader brings to the novel is essential in truly grasping the concepts and events that occur in Penny From Heaven."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2750233-mary", "userReview": "From BooklistGr. 5-8. Penny lives with her \"plain old American\" mother and grandparents, but she has an open invitation to visit her deceased father's Italian family, where the delicious aromas are as inviting as the boisterous relatives who welcome her. Against the backdrop of these contrasting 1950s households, the author of Newbery Honor Book Our Only May Amelia (1999) charts the summer of Penny's twelfth birthday, marked by hapless episodes as well as serious tensions arising from the estranged families' refusal to discuss her father's death. Penny is a low-key character, often taking a backseat role in escapades with high-spirited cousin Frankie. However, Holm impressively wraps pathos with comedy in this coming-of-age story, populated by a cast of vivid characters (a burping, farting grandpa; an eccentric uncle who lives in his car--\"not exactly normal for people in New Jersey\"). Concluding with a photo-illustrated endnote explaining Holm's inspirations in family history, this languidly paced novel will appeal most to readers who appreciate gentle, episodic tales with a nostalgic flavor. Hand selling may be necessary to overcome the staid jacket illustration. Jennifer MattsonCopyright \u00a9 American Library Association.I really enjoyed this book for a number of reasons. The characters were strong and well-defined. I really associated with Penny through her struggles with her family and the differences between the two. The relationship between Penny and her cousin, Frankie, was awesome. What I really enjoyed about this book, and the whole genre of historical fiction, is the ability to teach about history through fiction. If I wasn't in this class, I would probably enjoy reading this story simply for the story of Penny and her family. The storyline and characters are strong enough to support a story. However, what I will walk away with, after reading this book, is the knowledge about how Italians were treated at this time in history! I had no idea! Curfews, internment camps! This was a great story, but an even better history lesson."}, {"userName": "Betsy Ross", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52279554-betsy-ross", "userReview": "A very enjoyable and fun read peppered with enough adventure, humorous mishaps, and tender coming of age moments to send you on an emotional journey along with Penny. Set in 1953, the book gives you a chance to experience Penny's life, her triumphs, and downfalls, all through her eyes. Living with her grandparents on her mother's side- Me-me and Pop-pop, and spending time her crazy Italian side of her family, Penny has plenty of opportunity for thrills and lots of trouble. With her main partner in crime, her cousin Frankie (who collects prayer cards from funerals), an Italian Nonny who bursts into tears every time Penny's dead father is mentioned, doting uncles, and an impending romance between her mother and the milkman, Penny's days resemble a roller coaster with all the ups and downs imaginable. This particular time in her life forces big changes and new understandings to her perspective. Through laughter, tears, and all the in-betweens, Penny learns, changes, and grows. By the time you're finished reading, you can't help but feel as though you have as well.

This book is based on the author\u2019s own Italian American family. It depicts the 1953 time period when being Italian meant you were the enemy. The book also is rich in its description of families, more specifically about the things that separate them and being them together. Penny\u2019s life is not easy, having a father that is deceased, an uncle living in a car, and the two sides of her family not speaking to each other. Overall the book has many layers and themes including history, love, laughter, and the importance of family. This is both a heartwarming and sad story, as many coming of age events occur for Penny. With her father being deceased, Penny is torn between her maternal side of the family and her father\u2019s large Italian family, who is still extremely important to her. In addition, not having much money, having an uncle who lives in a car, as well as having a tragic accident happen to her forces her to grow up much faster and have maturity beyond her years. Overall, this book is very enjoyable because while it contains historical information, it pulls the reader in by being emotionally appealing. Any reader will be able to relate to this book because of the importance that is placed upon love and family, despite the difference in the time period and experiences. The author\u2019s note at the end also greatly adds to the book."}, {"userName": "Saira Shah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7528907-saira-shah", "userReview": "A Penny From Heaven is an outstanding book!

The Dodgers game is particularly egregious in its pointless naming of (relative) celebrities. Must we be told the name of the ballpark organist? I found the 11-year-old having discussions with her mother about mom's dating to be at least a quarter of a century too early.

What's more, her mother has just started to date the milkman, and she's grounded for the rest of the summer because she went, against her mother's strict orders, into a public pool, where she's sure to catch polio. Most oddly of all, no one in the family will talk about her father or how he died. The book is somewhat langorously paced until the middle, when Penny's life takes a dramatic turn, but the characters are so well drawn and Penny's voice is so distinct and likeable that the relatively slow narrative doesn't matter all that much.

Since I walked away with a little more knowledge and a curiosity to find out more, I gave the book 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Sarah Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4597485-sarah-stewart", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book very much. It felt very authentic historically and its refreshing to read something about an era that isn't written about very much. Everyone seems to skip the 50's in a rush toward the 40's and 60's. The character development was fantastic--I actually cared about the characters and they had interesting learning curves. Frankie was pretty awesome!"}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12859472-carrie", "userReview": "This was a wonderful book. I absolutely loved it. My sister married into an Italian family, and so many of the stories ring true. Penny is a great protagonist, sweet but not too sweet, in fact, altogether realistic. It is a tragedy of sorts, but not one that leaves you sad. Be sure to read the authors notes and check out the pictures at the end."}, {"userName": "Niki (Daydream Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6152323-niki-daydream-reader", "userReview": "I recommend the audio. I enjoyed the reader. This is the first chapter book that I read by Jennifer Holm and I loved it. I really enjoyed all the kookie characters in this story and the wild situations that they get in. I also kept thinking....what happened to her dad and how did he die?! My favorite character was Uncle Dominique...such a sweet character and my heart ached for him."}, {"userName": "Willa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35048086-willa", "userReview": "I LOVE this book. It takes place in 1953 and 11 year old Penny is living with her mom, grandpa, grandma, and has plans for the best summer ever. But that doesn't go the way she wants it too.(don't want to spoil book ;) )"}], "description": "It's 1953 and 11-year-old Penny dreams of a summer of butter pecan ice cream, swimming, and baseball. But nothing\u2019s that easy in Penny\u2019s family. For starters, she can\u2019t go swimming because her mother\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll catch polio at the pool. To make matters worse, her favorite uncle is living in a car. Her Nonny cries every time her father\u2019s name is mentioned. And the two sides of her family aren\u2019t speaking to each other!Inspired by Newbery Honor winner Jennifer Holm\u2019s own Italian American family, Penny from Heaven is a shining story about the everyday and the extraordinary, about a time in America\u2019s history, not all that long ago, when being Italian meant that you were the enemy. But most of all, it\u2019s a story about families\u2014about the things that tear them apart and bring them together. And Holm tells it with all the richness and the layers, the love and the laughter of a Sunday dinner at Nonny\u2019s. So pull up a chair and enjoy the feast!
