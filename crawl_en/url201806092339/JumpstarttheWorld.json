Jumpstart the World is indeed an important tale, but it's a grace to many groups: to those of us who have experienced unrequited love, to those of us who ache to belong but are not \"mainstream,\" to we who continually make mistakes but have a strong and gentle heart. In short, this book is for everybody. It would melt the heart of the most hardened homophobic/transphobic person alive, if only they would open the pages and read Elle's story. This book heals.Elle is an abandoned teen, and searching for approval so hard it hurts. She seems to want this attention from a certain type of person; instead, she finds offers of friendship from a misfit group of kids, some of whom are openly gay. This disquiets Elle on many levels. She falls in love with Frank, her neighbor, who is also a type of misfit, which pains Elle as well. Learning about her new friends, and who they love, is a difficult part of Elle's journey.Jumpstart is told in simple, plain prose, and somehow that makes every revelation Elle experiences more visceral. Sometimes Elle's thoughts aren't pretty, and this is addressed in spare language. Sometimes what happens is so beautiful, the straightforward words are like fists to the gut, causing a sharp intake and holding of breath--a resonance so deep you want to hold it forever. Both the ugly and the beautiful are here, existing side by side, and that is how this book tastes like truth.When I finished Jumpstart the World, I wanted to buy truckloads of it and stand on street corners, handing the book to strangers. There's so much power in this slim novel--power to change. It's a miracle of a read, and if there's one thing this story can do, it's take closed minds and open them wide and bare. It's a book to jumpstart the healing."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/878571-susan", "userReview": "Hyde flirts with didacticism, even if she doesn't outright commit to it. There are a lot of choices characters make in order to drive the story along in the right direction: Elle's mother abandons her daughter alone halfway across town; Elle is a loner with no friends and apparently no other family; even Elle's cat wants nothing to do with her; Elle cuts her hair and gets bullied at school for being gay; Elle makes friends with a group of gay students (except that Annabel has a prominent birthmark on her face instead of being gay to make her a school outcast--I don't even know where to go with equating her mark to being gay, plus she's randomly dropped out of the story in the middle anyway, so why bother putting her in in the first place?); Frank gets hurt (and can I just say, I was so relieved it was a random accident) so Elle can realize her feeling and make amends....Just a chain of events leading Elle to her big epiphany.I've talked about Elle a lot, right? Well, she's the point of view character, but this is also all about Elle, another priveleged white girl learning lessons. Do we seriously need another one of these books? Why not Frank's story? Why not Wilbur's?Elle's relationship with Wilbur is more believable than her crush on/love for Frank. This is a very short book and Hyde didn't spend enough time developing the relationship between Frank and Elle. She also has Elle telling us her feelings all the time instead of Hyde showing them through revealing prose.Things that really made me want to slap the daylights out of Elle: she has a special iPod just for listening to Janis Joplin; she calmly informs her mother that her mother will keep paying for Elle's apartment, like or not, because \"Independence has no reverse gear;\" her email address is independence16 (apparently she either didn't have email before she left her mother's apartment or she is really in love with her new self-image); she adopts a cat just to upset her mother, makes no effort to properly care for him, and then feels sorry for herself when he doesn't love her right away. Things pull together a little more at the end. I would have rated this higher until I started remembering how irritating the whole first half was."}, {"userName": "Shona", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4980524-shona", "userReview": "I would not classify this book as queer fiction because it's not about LGBT people. It's about using LGBT people as a prop to teach a heterosexual girl that being different is okay.Elle gets booted out of her home and into an apartment because her mother's new boo does not want her to be around. Elle meets neighbor Frank, crushes on neighbor Frank, freaks out when she discovers neighbor Frank is trans, learns some lessons, becomes a better person.Elle also does not want friends, at all!, yet she makes a solid group of friends that are outcasts because of their sexuality (and a birthmark, but this book didn't feel like fetishsizing birth defects, only sexuality and a man's trans identity.) She treats them rather cruely in the beginning, and they just take it. Ugh.Throughout the book Elle thinks, and vocalizes, a lot of hurtful things and only gets called on it once, by Molly, who then later apologizes for it.

The story was well written but, as a parent, I had a hard time with the part about Elle being set up in an apartment by her mother at sixteen, especially since they live in New York. I found that part unrealistic. And I didn't like Elle so I had a hard time relating to her and what was happening her life. I'd picked the book up at my library because I was interested in reading about transgender characters and I liked her portrayal of Frank. I thought Elle's reaction to finding out Frank was transgender was typical of most people, especially if they have a crush on that person. I would recommend the story for anyone whose interested in transgender characters and how they deal with living their live and how people often react to finding out that they are transgender."}, {"userName": "Jade", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42377294-jade", "userReview": "Okay so I had to read this book for book club and let me tell you, it's god awful. If you think this book is a good representation of the LGBTQIA+ community, you're sadly mistaken. Not only does this book sound like it was written by a third grader, but the characters are nothing more than their sexual/gender identity. Elle is the only one that isn't because the only thing her character even does is do things in spite of others (getting the cat to piss off her mom, cut her hair because her mom liked her hair) and or because of others (she does photography because the neighbor likes to take pictures, etc.). She's seriously terrible. And then Frank isn't even an actual good character, he's nothing more than being trans*. The Bobs are just gay, there's nothing in the entire book that makes them seem like actual people. One of the things that ticks me off the most is gay characters that are nothing more than gay, there's nothing else to them. You can't say \"gays are people too\" and then not even write them as people, you write them as just merely plot elements and an accessory to the story or main character."}, {"userName": "Angel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38710748-angel", "userReview": "I was really looking forward to reading this book. I finally found a YA book about gender! However this book was actually such a disappointment. It has terrible narration, dialogue, and boring characters. The narrator has a really negative attitude towards anything LGBTQ+ and freaks out and is so defensive about being called gay and even about the thought of someone being transgender. She kicks people out of her apartment for even having the thought.. This book is really bad and was a struggle to get through. I honestly think this book encourages negative attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community. It does not do a good job of educating (straight, especially) people about being transgender and gay.

Only when she meets her new neighbor, Frank, does she begin to feel a flicker of life return to her body. Although for Elle, the life she\u2019s about to embark on is one she couldn\u2019t have imagined if she tried. Forced to discover the importance of another\u2019s individual worth Elle is about to realize that she could impact not only her own life, but all who come in contact with her.Elle\u2019s experiences are influenced heavily by the lack of concern and love her mother has for her. Pre-occupied with her most recent boyfriend, Elle\u2019s mother abandons her. It effects everything about how Elle interacts with people. From the distance she keeps to which words she chooses to speak and when to say them. The only acquaintances she allows herself to have are her new neighbor Frank and then later a few friends from school. Even their interest and subsequent kindness isn\u2019t enough to break down the walls she\u2019s built.In ways that I haven\u2019t read before, Catherine Ryan Hyde captures what it means to be a teenager. Being one is such a multi-layered experience that, I think, as we get older we tend to peel away \u2013 leaving only our core-selves. We forget that to be a teenager is more than attending high school and plodding through homework; it\u2019s painful, enlightening, joyous, heart-wrenching, arduous, and much much more. As a teen we see things for the first time as we never have before and often we make mistakes that can feel like the end of the world because we\u2019ve never experienced them before. We often grow numb as we age, forgetting the passions and anxieties we once had. Jumpstart the World wipes away that desensitization and opens your eyes to things once forgotten.One of my favorite scenes from the story happens just after Elle\u2019s discovery that her cat is suddenly quite ill, leading her to seek Frank\u2019s help in which she also learns he\u2019s transgender. In one fell swoop she feels unsettled and unsure of how to handle the situation. Are they friends still? Is she now gay? With no instructions and the absence of love in her life up to this point she\u2019s finds it nearly impossible to process what\u2019s happening to her.For me, my Frank was a boy by the name of Dirk. It was my junior year of high school and we\u2019d just moved to a new town with a new school. I knew no one. He was the first person to say hello to me and the last to say goodbye before we moved back to our hometown a year later. Completely smitten, I ignored what was so blatantly obvious to so many others. In the end I only discovered Dirk was gay three days before we moved and in so many ways I was just like Elle in Jumpstart the World, devastated and scared. This was my first personal encounter with anyone gay and I had no idea what it meant for our future friendship. Much like Elle I discovered that it changed nearly nothing, except it did. He was still a huge part of my life and someone who had made a difference when no one else had. He made me aware of others in a way no one else could have, from how he regarded me to how he was(and had been) treated himself. It was a defining moment in my life, one in which enabled me to look on another with new eyes, an open mind and most of all\u2026love.Love. It\u2019s power to move forces for good and it\u2019s debilitating effect when it is lacking is tremendous. In Jumpstart the World love could quite possibly be considered another character, it encapsulates everything that Elle experiences, the good and the bad. Her mother, her new circle of friends, and most especially her relationship with Frank. Though Elle doesn\u2019t realize it initially, love is something that\u2019s a driving force in her life, and unfortunately it\u2019s due to a lack thereof. Thankfully with the help of her friends, most importantly her relationships with Frank and Wilbur, she is able to thrive in her new life. A life that has the potential to \u201cjumpstart the world.\u201dFor me, Jumpstart the World is a must read. Not only will it help adults in regaining a sense of appreciation and understanding of this difficult time of life, it may also help others to become more tolerant and kind. In a day when teens often feel abandoned and completely alone they need books like Jumpstart the World that show them there is love in the world. With an eloquence I have yet to read elsewhere, Catherine Ryan Hyde illustrates precisely the impact one individual can have on another, especially when the motive is love."}, {"userName": "Julie Smith (Knitting and Sundries)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3133122-julie-smith-knitting-and-sundries", "userReview": "This review first appeared on my blog: http://www.knittingandsundries.com/20...At 15, Elle isn't old enough to be on her own, but her mother's boyfriend doesn't want her around. Rather than being a good mom and telling the boyfriend to take a hike, Elle's mom rents an apartment across town for her to live in. In defiance, Elle chops off her hair and heads to her new high school looking a bit worse for the wear. She also chooses the ugliest cat she could find at the pound to irritate her beauty-obsessed mother. Toto is scraggly and only has one eye, but Elle grows to love him.Her neighbor Frank helps her with her unpacking, and Elle develops a bit of a crush on him. Then she finds out he has a partner, Molly, but the crush endures. When Molly goes to her locker at school, someone has scrawled the word \"QUEER\" across it (probably due to her chopped off hair), and that lets her know that she will probably not be making many new friends. She does, however, end up getting to know a group of LGBT kids, and, while she's not certain exactly how she feels about them, they take her in with open arms. At a get-together at Elle's apartment, her new friends tell her that they think Frank is transgender, and Elle is flabbergasted at even the thought, especially since she's crushing so much on him. If he's transgender, what does that say about HER, especially since all of her new friends have varying sexual identities?This novel is brilliant; I love Ms. Hyde's writing style. She totally gets into the mind of a teenager who is going through a heck of a lot. Knowing that your mother prefers being with her boyfriend over taking care of you would throw anyone into a tailspin, and finding yourself seriously crushing on someone who is or was a woman at the same time?This book is not about sexual identity, although that theme runs through the book. It's about friendship, and acceptance, and knowing that being different isn't a bad thing. There is a lot of punch packed into this short novel, and I would highly recommend it to any reader, not just YA readers. I really loved it, and I'm passing it on to my Not-So-Bebe-Girl Autumn, who I think will love it too.QUOTESI took it kind of hard. Hearing that he wasn't around much. But then again, I don't have tons and tons of friends. And only one ever offered to look after me. Even my mother isn't entirely committed to that.I didn't want to look at him. Because I didn't want to do that thing. That obvious thing. Where you look at him in a whole new light. Use the new information to look at him and see something entirely different. I didn't care to try on any new views of Frank.It struck me suddenly how utterly ridiculous it is to ever think you know anybody. Or to ever think you've found anybody you can love.Because you don't know anybody.Ever.Especially when you haven't even known them all that long. But, really, not even when you've known them all your life. I never thought my mother would trade me for some dork named Donald. And I sure as hell never thought Frank was anything other than a guy.Writing: 4.5 out of 5 starsPlot: 4 out of 5 starsCharacters: 4.5 out of 5 starsReading Immersion: 5 out 5 starsBOOK RATING: 4.5 out of 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Gaby Melara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12978896-gaby-melara", "userReview": "This book called \"Jumpstart the World\" is about a sixteen years old girl name Elle who's relationship with her mother is not the best. Her mom basically chooses her boyfriend over her,so she sent her to live in a apartment by herself where she meets this guy named Frank who is many years older than her. Since she saw Frank from the very first time she liked him and can not stop thinking about him. Since Elle moved to her new apartment Frank have offer her his friendship and helped her in many things so Elle started feeling something for Frank. \"Frank is the type of guy that's hard not to like\" Says Elle. Based on what I've read so far about the book i think this book is great.! I really enjoy reading it everything i start to read it. It's a very catchy book that grabs the reader's attention really fast. Also this book is a good book for a teenager like me to read because Elle's life story makes a connection with my life,so i really understand what her life is having to deal with her mother's boyfriend and the fact that she does not feel like she has a mother because her mother is never there for her.At the beginning of the book i noticed that this book had caught my attention really fast which is rare. Every time i read a book it usually starts very slow and boring, but this book actually was not.This book is very fun and interesting at the same time. I liked that the reader used very good grammar which makes the reader read even more.Before i started reading the book i was wondering what the cover meant. I Really thought it was a scary book but as soon as i started reading it i found out the true meaning of the book cover. It really fits and describes the story.I definitely loved this book even though i'm still reading it. I enjoy every page i read because it's just a great book. I will definitely recommend this book to a friend because i know she will enjoy it as much as i am. Its a great book and the story is interesting.

I was a little afraid that this book would be maudlin and preachy. I was pleasantly surprised. Catherine Ryan Hyde showed both restraint and skill when writing this book. Obviously this book would be wonderful for LGBTQ teens to read. It is important to be able to see yourself reflected in literature. But in a way I almost feel as if it is a more important book to share with people who do not have a connection with that community. The beauty of literature is that it allows us to experience the world from a different perceptive, to gain awareness of another's reality. This book in some ways is like an introduction from Elle to the reader, \"Here is my friend Frank. This is why I love him.\" It is hard to truly hate someone once you get to know them and I feel that that is some of the lasting power of this book.Jumpstart the World manages to do with without feeling contrived. Considering the potential for this subject to read as a sort of after school special I think that is remarkable. I was impressed that the characters seemed so authentic. There were no \"angels\" and even characters that are written as deeply flawed (such as Elle's mother) are never shown as being flat or without the potential for change.This book left me with characters that I really loved (Wilbur, Bob, and Bobby on particular) and a great deal to think about."}, {"userName": "Liza Gilbert", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2035961-liza-gilbert", "userReview": "I read Hyde's Pay It Forward when it was first published over 10 years ago.

I passed on watching the movie version.I was curious about this book, written for teens, with such a hot-button-issue premise. I figured it would be a tome designed for dozens of ridiculously emotional plot twists.While there were some plot twists, I felt they were completely reasonable, and the singular Catherine Ryan Hyde moment that really stabbed me clean through was a simple comment made by a secondary character on page 169.This was by far a more elegant story in terms of presentation. All of the fat and gristle in the story had been trimmed away, and what remained was the first person teen narrative and some ideas about tolerance and understanding.While many teens and adults are not interested in reading books about tolerance and understanding re: gender / sexual identities and mental illness, this is a quick, compelling, engrossing, and addictive read that is very hard to put down.This has been one of the better books I've read this year.

Elle\u2019s mom basically kicks her out. Before Elle moves to her new apartment, Elle decides to go to the shelter and gets a one eyed cat. Elle likes this cat but mainly gets him because her mother would hate it. She names him Toto after Toto in the Wizard of Oz. While Elle is moving into her new apartment, Frank introduces himself and that he is her neighbor. Right way, Elle knows that she is going to like Frank. At the beginning of the book, Elle has sort of long red hair but then she cuts it into a short man-like hair style (specifically Annie Lennox). Elle also knows that her mother would hate this. We learn that Frank lives with Molly, and she is a photographer who makes really good chicken noodle soup. At school, a group of guys writes \u2018queer\u2019 on Elle\u2019s locker. Elle then goes into the bathroom and meets Shane who has blue hair. She is skipping class. Elle starts sitting with Shane and her friends Bob and Bob (who are dating), Wilbur, and Annabel (even though we don\u2019t really see much of her). Elle visits Molly and Frank a few times during the novel. On Elle\u2019s birthday, after coming home from school, Elle finds a wrapped present outside her door. She received a large piece of cake and a stuffed cat (Toto currently hates her). A few days later, Elle has a party with Shane, the Bobs, and Wilbur. They bring 2 six packs of beer. Later during the party, Frank stopped over to say that tomorrow Molly was making soup. After he leaves, Little Bob says FTM. Then the rest of her friends start talking but Elle is confused. They think Frank is a trans man but Elle doesn\u2019t believe them. The next night, while Elle is over at Molly and Frank\u2019s place, Elle is uncertain if she is still friends with the people from school because she felt that they were judgemental. She talks about it with Molly and Frank and they assure her and want her to have more than 2 friends. When she gets home, a present and card are sitting outside her door. She receives a painting of flowers from the Bobs. Elle is enlightened that they gave her something. The next day, Wilbur tells Elle that Shane is looking for her and they (Shane and Elle) argue about whether Frank is a trans man or not. She reunites with her and the Bobs. When Elle arrives home from school, her mom is there unexpectedly. Elle was mad at her mother but she also got presents for her birthday so that made her happy. Since Molly is really good at photography and Frank is really good at Scrabble, Elle wants to take picture of them dancing. Her photos didn\u2019t turn out so well but then her mom arrives. Her mother is confused about how she was taking pictures and Elle explains that she used the money from returning all of the things her mother bought her. A while later, Elle realizes that Toto\u2019s food bowl still has a lot of food in it. Elle finds Toto in a closet and he doesn\u2019t look so good. One side of his face was lumpy and puffed up. We learned earlier that Frank is a vet so Elle runs over and talks to him. Frank is holding a party. While in Franks apartment, Elle sees a top surgery tree but is confused at what it is. On the subway, Elle asks about the top surgery tree. Frank explains that it\u2019s a phase of gender-reassignment surgery (he was a woman). At the vet we learn that Toto had an infected tooth and they had to surgically remove it. It rested and received antibiotics at the hospital. Elle skips school a few days but one day she decides to go in later in the day. She finds Wilbur who is skipping gym class. Elle asks him if she can take pictures of him. They also talk about Toto. Elle brings Toto home a few days later but has to give him pills so she has Frank help her. They also talk about how their relationship is now that Elle knows that Frank was once a woman. That next Sunday, Wilbur and Elle go to a park (probably Central Park since the novel is set in New York) and Elle takes pictures of Wilbur near a dog statue (Balto?). After taking pictures, Elle and Wilbur talk about their sexuality (he wears a lot of makeup). Wilbur doesn\u2019t need to be a girl but he\u2019s not happy with who he is. Wilbur also knows that Elle is uncomfortable with Frank. When they go back to Elle\u2019s apartment, there are police officers there, and it looks like someone got hit by a car (Wilbur then leaves). Harry (who is schizophrenic and crazy if he doesn\u2019t take his meds) says he was the one that did it. Elle goes out on her fire escape, which she does a lot (Frank also sits out on his and they talk) and she sees glasses on the ground. She thinks they are Franks and she runs down, grabs them, and finds Molly. We then learn that Frank was the person hit by the car and he is at the hospital. Elle doesn\u2019t believe that Crazy Harry should be able to live outside of supervision (Molly and Elle talk about this, and Molly doesn\u2019t hate Harry). Frank goes home that night because he refuses to stay at the hospital but Liz, a nurse, is with him and Molly. The next night Frank needs to go to the hospital. Since Molly and Frank aren\u2019t married, Molly can not stay after visiting hours, but Frank has to stay in the hospital. Elle decides that she will stay with him that night. She hides under the bed and isn\u2019t seen for awhile. Then a nurse comes in to check on Frank (checks his drain which Elle had to look away for) and Elle learns that the nurse is a man. Elle quickly hides behind a chair in the room but the nurse sees her. The nurse and Elle agree that they never talked at that he didn\u2019t know she was in there. A few days later, Frank is able to go home. One night Wilbur comes to Elle\u2019s apartment and the next morning they talk about Elle\u2019s crush on Frank and her cat. Frank asks Elle to change his bandages because Molly gets queasy when she does it. While Elle is helping Frank, she gets queasy from seeing a metal bar and pins in his arm. Frank mentions jumpstarting the world. A few days later, Elle\u2019s mother arrives again and Elle tells her about Franks accident and Toto. The next day, Frank tells Elle that he and Molly are moving back to South Carolina, because of the doctor bills and the rent. Wilbur comes over one night and they talk about how sad Elle is about Frank leaving. Wilbur explains to her that she isn\u2019t alone. A few days later, Elle\u2019s mother comes back and tells her that her boyfriend broke up with her. Elle also is joined by her school friends with ice cream because Wilbur told them about Franks situation. That night Shane makes up a game where each person has to say the worst, most painful loss that they ever had with someone. Little Bobby talks about his relationship with his pediatrician. Bobby talks about a thirteen year old girl he had a crush on and they wrote notes in class. Bobby kept all of the notes but the girl wanted them back and then she burned them. Someone else (maybe Big Bob) talks about his cousin who he had a lot of experiences with but then his cousin told everyone that Bob was gay. Wilbur talks about his mom\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s brother who was really kind to him but then he molested him. Wilbur also talks about how he wanted him to keep doing what he did so he could get attention. The day that Frank and Molly leave is the day that Elle talks to Crazy Harry. He is interested in her camera. Also that day, Toto finally comes out of his hiding spot and loves up Elle. The last few pages are letters."}, {"userName": "Ck361", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66085953-ck361", "userReview": "This was my first book by the author. I did like the book overall, mostly because it discussed an interesting subject that I didn't know much about. Interestingly, I couldn't picture my \"Frank\" in my head. The only person I could think of was Chaz Bono, so that's who I envisioned for Frank! Not sure how many other people did. After reading the book I went and watched Chaz's documentary and learned more about the subject. So on that level, it really helped educate me and I'm proud of the book for touching on the transgendered subject. However, there's some flaws... I won't rehash the synopsis -- that's pretty much been covered. However, I felt the storyline was a bit rushed so we (the reader) could get to Elle falling in love with Frank and the story could move along. Love can move fast, so okay, well give her that. The writer's style kind of took some getting used to. I'm not really faulting that, it just made things a bit bumpy for me. However, I was reading another book by another author who teaches creative writing, and that book felt so formulated I couldn't finish it. I also felt the LGBT community wasn't well \"respected\"? I know that's kind of the point of the story, and I appreciate the main character representing that part of society that thinks a certain way. Elle is just willing to opening say it, which in most cases I doubt someone would do. I mean, a bully might, but Elle's kind of nice, she's driven by ignorance. And then her LGBT friends that have accepted her, just sort of put up with it. They're understanding, I wish I had friends like them. So that aside... I loved the storyline with Frank and Elle and Molly. I didn't feel satisfied with the ending though. Just sort of ends and you're left feeling like, \"Oh, okay. Bye for now.\""}, {"userName": "JulesGP", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50245980-julesgp", "userReview": "Touched on many themes, including taking on the responsibilities of becoming an adult, meeting and accepting people from all walks of life, and accepting your own flaws and self worth. The plot itself was flimsy, a 15 year old set up in her own apartment and new school so mom can be alone with her boyfriend. It felt like the beginning of a very good book and sometimes, it got there. Other times, I felt that the author just skimmed over the story and there wasn't much depth. I wish she had doubled the length and taken more time with her characters. And just my opinion, I think if Elle had been older, even 17 or 18, there could have been more options in the story. 15/16 was just too young and awkward, especially when the love interest was 30ish."}, {"userName": "Kathy Oaster", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31452232-kathy-oaster", "userReview": "A wonderful story that deals with unexpected friendship.

A simply told tale, Jumpstart the World lightly questions sexuality and the role gender identity plays while simultaneously looking at the role of friendship in a young girl's life.A Bit of a RambleWhen Elle's mother kicks her out because of her boyfriend, Elle moves into her own apartment, right next door to Frank and Molly. Frank is different; he's gentle and listens to her and makes her realize that maybe being a loner isn't all it's cracked up to be. Despite his girlfriend, Elle finds herself crushing on this man 15 years her senior. But then she finds out that he's trans* and her world is shaken.I loved the delicate nature of this book. While it deals with some really deep issues, the book stays sincere and realistic in its treatment of important themes. For example, the story starts out with a significant thought told simply. Elle points out how her mother consistently uses the words beautiful and ugly without even realizing it. Elle claims that this tendency reveals a significant part of her mother's character: \"Lately I've been noticing how people have these ways of accidentally letting you see what's important to them. I know it doesn't sound like any big deal. But it is to me. Because I'm not beautiful. And we both know it.\" I love this commentary on how the use of language, unconscious word choices, can not only reveal a person's psyche, but can also affect those who are hearing the language.Later in the novel, Elle contemplates her feelings for Frank, after finding out he is trans*. \"Why did I still feel the same way about him? How could it still be like that? But a little voice in the back of my head - well, not exactly in the back of my head, more like in a spot over my head - said \"why\" and \"how\" questions were almost never helpful. Things either aren't or they are. All the wondering in the world won't make things anything but just what they are.\"While I don't necessarily agree 100% with that sentiment, I can see the simple logic of it. It's like trying to figure out why I love my husband. I could list all of his positive points, but many people are also smart and kind and fun and caring. I love my husband because I love him. In this case, I really thought Elle's understanding of the basic nature of her feelings impressive as she is so young and her situation so difficult for her.I was also really impressed by something Amy of Amy Reads expressed quite precisely in her review of this book: \"She doesn\u2019t struggle with who HE is, but rather who SHE herself is.\" This sort of acceptance of difference while simultaneously addressing the issue is how things should be in literature! Another awesome blogger, Cass from Bonjour Cass expressed a similar sentiment: \"Once Elle knows Frank is trans, she knows. There\u2019s no hand ringing over whether or not he is \u201creally\u201d a man, and then she struggles with what her crush on him means for her own sexuality without questioning his. I found this completely refreshing.\" I feel like I am in the company of great minds since this fact really stood out to me as well.There was only one problem I had with the book, really one section. As I said earlier, the book felt very sincere to me, except for one section. Every now and then a book which is going along smoothly suddenly includes a passage, a conversation, a section which is a little too preachy. Sort of like that horrific scene in Transformers where Optimus Prime (I think???) gives that little speech about how humans are so horrible and yet they are redeemed through their love for each other (the same thing happens in the movie Stardust and in War of the Worlds and in a bunch of other films). In Jumpstart the World, the overly profound section also includes the titular phrase which sort of doubled the ridiculousness.That one section aside, however, this book was really enjoyable, and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Maggie Desmond-O'Brien", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2950798-maggie-desmond-o-brien", "userReview": "If any of my readers bore witness to my Friday night Twitter frenzy, you'll know I was in the midst of frantic revisions to a short story for a contest, and that I didn't take it very well. I still think that story is a piece of crap and can't believe that I actually submitted it, like getting-nasty-adrenaline-tingles-every-time-I-think-about-someone-reading-it kind of can't believe I actually submitted it. It's the first short story I've let anybody read in three years, because writing is terrifying. It's putting a piece of yourself in someone else's hands, and you never know how they'll deal with it. It's why, no matter how scathing I can get on this blog, anyone who's gone through the ordeal of getting a book in my hands has my respect; those who tackle topics as big and terrifying as Catherine Ryan Hyde does here, my hero worship for all eternity. From the second I read this blurb, I knew I was reading this book. And was I ever not disappointed.Everything that makes this book work rests on a fundamental principle that the author seems to understand perfectly: any teen that says they haven't questioned their authority, their friends, their sexuality, their place in the world, and most importantly, themselves, is lying. Being a teen is being in flux, and Jumpstart the World captures this with the kind of authenticity that makes me cry big sloppy tears. (Multiple times.)It's a scenario I imagine most teens would struggle to see themselves in beyond the occasional daydream: our narrator, Elle, lives by herself in an apartment in New York City because her mom's got a douchebag boyfriend who doesn't want to deal with her. She happens to have nice neighbors, and also happens to find herself accepted by the \"Us\" crowd at high school (a crowd united almost entirely by sexual preference, except, of course, for Elle). Yet somehow it never seems anything other than normal, because the author does such a good job of making Elle us. Not Bella-Swan-Mary-Sue sort of us, but all the real uncertainty and hurt that comes with growing up. One of my favorite passages is early in the book, when someone spray paints a slur on Elle's locker after she cuts her hair: I'm not gay. Why would somebody paint that on my locker? I'm not gay. Must have been a case of mistaken identity. Or the haircut. I thought it made me look like Annie Lennox. I didn't think it made me look gay.Which I suppose is a nice transition into my thoughts on one of the reasons this book has gotten attention on Twitter and in the book blogosphere: its frank treatment of the LGBTQ community. In a word: brilliant. In another word: brave. Basically, it never veers into \"shock\" territory, and simply explores gender identity in all its forms - something YA could really use more of. I know I've said in the past on this blog that I'm straight, definitely straight. This probably veers into too-personal territory, but in the past few months I've started realizing I'm closer to bi, or at the very least questioning - and also that that's okay. I wish there were more books like this one that help me remember that that's okay, and not ones that make me feel put in a gender/relationship box. It's sympathetic without being pandering or hitting you over the head with a message. It's respectful. It's realistic. Honestly, this idea, which in a sidebar has restored my belief in the Magical Author Idea Tree, and especially the author's treatment of the idea, is what elevates this book from good to great.It's so rare that my only real complaint about a book is that it doesn't go on long enough, but that's the case here. It's easily one of the best YA books I've read this year, if not period, and the kind I want to coerce everyone I know into reading. So if you're reading this review, I'm coercing you, and no guarantees it won't be forcibly. (Just kidding. Or am I?) Five out of five stars."}], "description": "Elle is a loner.
