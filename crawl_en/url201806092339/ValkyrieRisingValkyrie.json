I used to resent Hearne for that teacher mode he tends to slip into in the middle of an action scene, but his never-ending lectures proved to be useful after all. And people say reading urban fantasy is a waste of time. But I digress\u2026I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy Valkyrie Rising as much as I did. It took me completely by surprise. I only realized how much fun I was having when I looked up and saw that five hours had passed since I started reading. The plot is admittedly pretty formulaic, but there were a few things that made Valkyrie Rising stand out. First among them is the quality of Paulson\u2019s writing. While I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it beautiful, it\u2019s pretty clear that Paulson writes with great ease. Her prose flows smoothly and the story itself is relatively fast-paced. Believe me, the Valkyries will barely give you time to breathe. The romance was incredibly sweet and it certainly kept me on my toes, but I was a bit unhappy with the love interest. Tucker \u2013 Graham and Ellie\u2019s best friend and Ellie\u2019s secret crush \u2013 was undeniably charming, and yet, sometimes a boy, even a fictional one, can be a bit too perfect. Everything about him was in its place: he was adorable when he needed to be, unflinchingly loyal, sweet, patient, heart-stoppingly gorgeous, smart and extremely brave. But although I enjoy reading about a swoon-worthy boy as much as the next girl, I need him to have at least one defining characteristic, something that sets him apart and makes him unforgettable. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll forget all about Tucker the second I stop writing this review.Ellie, on the other hand, won\u2019t be so easy to forget. Her character is built on a clich\u00e9 or ten, sure, but Paulson did with her what she absolutely failed to do with Tuck \u2013 she gave her just enough quirks to make her memorable. Aside from that, we get to witness some serious personal growth, and a few moments of weakness I found very endearing. The most interesting part for me was Ellie\u2019s relationship with her brother Graham. Even though Graham\u2019s overprotectiveness was just a tiny bit exaggerated, it served as a motivator for Ellie\u2019s growth and her fight for independence. A Valkyrie shouldn\u2019t be bossed around by her older brother, should she? \nI glanced down at the image of my grandmother in all her Valkyrie glory. I wished with all my might that she\u2019d appear right then and save the day. But she didn\u2019t. For the first time in my life, there was no one there to fix things but me.\nShould you read Valkyrie Rising? Definitely! It\u2019s well-written, fun and very romantic. Plus, there are Norse gods, angry Norwegian people, Valkyrie, Valkyrie hunters and swords. What\u2019s not to like?!"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6010839-lisa", "userReview": "GRs Rating: I\u2019m thinking this one sits at about 3.5 Stars for me.I often find that writing reviews for books that were just \u201cokay\u201d for me are the hardest ones to write. Valkyrie Rising by Ingrid Paulson kind of sits in the middle for me. There was a lot I liked about the book and other things that I thought were simply mediocre. It\u2019s not like the book was poorly written, it\u2019s not. It's just that there were times where I just could not muster up enough emotion to care what was going on. I\u2019m not trying to be harsh because Valkyrie Rising was a decent read; however, it did not grip me and hold my interest like some others books do.The highlights of Valkyrie Rising are that Ms. Paulson painted a beautiful picture of modern day Norway and Norse Mythology. Throw in a superbly hot male who is crushing on our Valkyrie heroine \u2013 Mr. Tucker Halloway \u2013 and you get a pretty good storyline. The plot line was one that I found interesting at times and other moments I found to be dragging. The parts where Ellie was grappling with herself and we had to read pages of inner monologue were a little much for me. Further, Ellie made some bad decisions and simply did not think at times. That sort of behaviour gets on my nerves. Tucker\u2019s snarky and humourous rants made up for all that though. Although, if you are expecting a huge romantic storyline between Tucker and Ellie, there is not one. These two have grown up with each other and have had secret crushes on one another. Other than finally admitting how they feel to one another and a few kisses, there is not much more.Overall, Valkyrie Rising is a decent read and I would recommend you pick this one up if you are into mythology. It is worth the read."}, {"userName": "equilibri", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5577559-equilibri", "userReview": "I didn't enjoy anything about this book, I'm sorry to say.

I don't think I have ever read a young adult Valkyrie book and it seemed like a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately I didn't like this too much. The actual rating I'm giving is 1.5 stars.Ellie is not a likable character to me. She annoyed me to no end. I could tell the author wanted her to be a true heroine. Someone that didn't really have confidence but grows into the person she was always meant to be. She was a whiny brat that just let things happen to her until...VIOLA she's a kick ass Valkyrie who has never-ending powers? No, I don't accept that transition. She just pops up with these random ass superpowers when she conveniently needs them. No training, no clues throughout her whole life that she was a Valkyrie. It just starts to happen. That totally turned me off from the story.The only thing good about this book is Tucker. He was such a good guy. You could tell that he was the misunderstood one, not Ellie. Ellie's story only got interesting to me when Tucker was thrown into the mix. I hope that this remains to be a stand alone novel and that a sequel doesn't spring up in the future.

Yeah, I do admit the blurb and the concept is very interesting and that it pulled me in, but for some reason my expectations for this book at the start were just... meh. I wasn't expecting anything special. But I'll say now that I was wrong, cause I really enjoyed reading this.So we have Ellie Overholt, a seemingly shy girl with an uber-popular and a little too over- protective older brother, who goes to Norway for the summer to visit her grandmother Hilda. But during the first few days there, she realizes that the townspeople were acting very strangely around her. And then she finds out about the disappearances of the boys in the town, and how they're linked to the townspeople's beliefs of there being Valkyries around, and that she's one of them. When her older brother Graham is suddenly one of those kidnapped boys, it's up to Ellie and her brother's infuriating but gorgeous best friend Tucker, to find out the truth about the kidnappings and the legends surrounding it.The Valkyries in this book are basically these drop-dead gorgeous girls/women that have the ability to control people, and what they do is that they seek out boys who are strong enough to be soldiers for Odin\u2014yes, the Odin\u2014and they take them to Valhalla. The leader of the Valkyrie pack is Astrid, and she's the most powerful besides Ellie's grandmother. I liked the overall mythology in this book, but if this were ever to become a series\u2014which I desperately hope it will\u2014I would love if the author expanded it, cause she can do so much with the world of this book.Ellie was a very likable character. I liked that she kept her head in the game and wasn't so entangled in the romance\u2014which we'll get to later. She was a little lost and oblivious at first, but that's normal and not her fault because she was kept completely in the dark about anything Valkyrie all her life, and she made up for it later on. She was never annoying in any way, really, at least for me. I dunno, I don't really have that much more to say about her. Just that she's a likable character.Tucker Halloway. This guy, he's the witty, sarcastic, cocky, smirks-a-lot type. And yes, he's douchey. But you know what? He was the likable kind of douchey. He also was never afraid to show his vulnerable side, and I was always aware that he cared for Ellie. Something near the end did make me doubt him for a sec, though, and I'm pretty sure it might make you guys do the same. But in a nutshell he was an awesome love interest. A lovable douchebag.The romance between Ellie and Tuck is one of the main reasons I like this book a lot. It was very slow-paced and hesitant, and it took over 250 or so pages before they kissed, which I'm so relieved about because in most YA these days, we have the main characters kissing in 100 pages or less. Anyway, what I also liked about their romance was their banter with each other. Since I'm currently reading Onyx by Jennifer Armentrout right now, I couldn't help but compare these two with Katy and Daemon. The difference is I guess in the heroines, because Ellie isn't easily pissed or riled up by Tuck's remarks\u2014which, believe me, aren't as assholish as Daemon's. Katy just immediately gets her panties in a twist and that just fuels Daemon even more. Most of the time Ellie kept calm and threw witty replies right back at him. Overall I thought their romance was really cute n' fluffy.The ending is really making me want a sequel. Badly. I can't find there being any plans for a sequel because in Goodreads this book isn't even in a series. That kinda worries me because I can totally picture it in my mind, this being a sequel. The author can do so much and explore many new, awesomer things. And she just has to make this a series because there were quite a few things that were unresolved at the end.Like, really, she has to. If she isn't going to then I don't think I can deal.All in all, this book was great. It did a great job in differentiating itself from other currently popular YA titles, in that it had a nice slow-paced romance and a very interesting Norse mythology theme. If you're a huge fan of mythology YA, then this book is one you'd definitely enjoy. :D"}, {"userName": "Isamlq", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4016030-isamlq", "userReview": "[(Was I the only one wondering why Tuck was doing the training?

Odin and his minion - the brave and the strong Valkyries aided the god in guiding the dead to his kingdom. This novel, however, tells the story of a power hungry god who collects living soldiers instead of the dead.Ellie's looking forward to a summer holiday in Norway; away from the hustle of L.A. and away from Tuck - her brother's best friend who stirs a gamut of emotions that she's sometimes too afraid to entertain. But luck and fate are definitely not on her side when she finds out that he's to stay with them for a couple of weeks.Norway used to be so friendly. What ever happened to the nice people who used to drill her about the celebrities in Hollywood? What ever happened to the nice, warm reception that she used to get from everyone? There's something amiss in the little town as she dodges insults, whispers and threats lest she leaves the country. She soon finds out the cause of their contempt by witnessing a kidnapping in plain sight. Her grandmother disappears without a trace and Ellie's brother, Graham was taken right under her nose. Kickassery ensues. She needs to embrace her true nature if she wants to save the people she loves and those who'd been kidnapped. This is the stuff legends are made of and it's up to Ellie to answer to the call. Loooooove. That is all. How could I not? Kick ass, Xena-like women, mythology and romance. Ingrid Paulson hit all the right notes in this novel, creating her version by simplifying a Norse myth that an uneducated reader like me could appreciate. The romance was torture in the most pleasurable way possible: slightly forbidden, ocassionally awkward and plenty sweet. You only need to read the prequel to this book (Valkyrie Symptoms) to love all the ways that Tuck could reduce you into a puddle of goo. There were plenty of actions and frustrating secrets, leading to a suspenseful, wholesome read. While there wasn't anything cliff-hangerish (that's not a word, I know) about the ending, the wait for the next one will be just as tortorous. Ellie's just come into her power and abilities and the sisterhood of the Valkyries was barely glanced over. I'm not only looking forward to Tuck and Ellie's budding romance, I'm also looking forward to how these warriors would defeat a god. There is also an ominous mystery surrounding Loki that definitely sets the tone for the next book.Overall, this book has become one of my favorite Mythology retelling so far, regardless of whether or not I'm abreast of the original one. Action packed, sweet romance, kick ass character, what else could you possibly want? Valkyrie Rising is a lovely introduction to a series that's original in the cacophony of YA paranormals we read nowadays. Do yourself a favor, don't miss out on this one."}, {"userName": "Ravenous Biblioworm", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7774463-ravenous-biblioworm", "userReview": "Rating: 2/5As seen at http://youngadultbookguide.wordpress.com I did not like this book. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I\u2019m going to tell you how I really feel. Yep, I won\u2019t hold back either. But before the rant I\u2019ll tell you what I liked.I liked the Norse mythology behind the book. I liked the last quarter of the book when everything fell together and started moving along and there was action. But by then I just didn\u2019t really care anymore because everything neatly falls into place (in the not so good way)\u2026 into happily ever after, and the previous 3/4 of the books I was just too annoyed and irritated to put in effort to really care. So thinking upon it, there was really only one thing I liked about the book: the Norse Myths. Well I guess I liked the action at the end.Let\u2019s start with the plot. To be honest I was a raving demon the first quarter of the book. Because Valkyries do not do what was implied in that first part. And they only take the dead. So I was pissed to say the least. I\u2019m all for author creativity, but if your going to twist and turn and manipulate the mythological figures into something else, why not just make it something else, instead of the perversion of what you made them to be. But putting aside my rage, I read on and held onto hope that the author will explain themselves by the end. I do have to hear the whole story. So by the end yes, the author redeems herself, though the reasons for taking live subjects is shaky at best and not very believable. Actually, it wasn\u2019t very much specifically addressed. The only thing that was addressed was that according to tradition, Valkyries took dead souls only, the basic myth thing.Still on plot. Through out the story, there was a carrot that was dangled upon readers face. People would whisper to one another in the book. You know, like, \u201cHa! We know something you don\u2019t!\u201d Then they would whisper more. \u201cI bet you really want to knoOOOoooow!\u201d Then they do some MORE whispering. \u201cI bet you really really curious, aren\u2019t you!?\u201d Me at this point: \u201cActually no, I don\u2019t give a /censored/. Oh cake!\u201d Whispering Peoples: \u201cWe want cake.\u201d Me: \u201cDoes it look like I\u2019m /effing/ sharing.\u201d Some would come up to Ellie and threaten her and she would be like, \u201cI have no freaking clue what you are talking about.\u201d (And she really didn\u2019t and it really wasn\u2019t her fault.) And they would be like,\u201d Yes, you do, you murderous /expletive /.\u201d Sure that was fine the first time around, but when Ellie proceeds to find answers for herself, the folks around her refuses to answer, which was fine the first time around too, but then they continue to do so, and it isn\u2019t the first time around anymore. Then they would drop one word or two word hints. Basically, because the plot couldn\u2019t hold it\u2019s own, these hint droppings had to be given to keep readers\u2019 interest in reading further. It was some coyness that was not needed. You don\u2019t have Grandmother sit Ellie down and tell her that boys will start noticing her because she\u2019s special, not because she\u2019s pretty but special and Ellie has to be careful because there are things that Ellie don\u2019t understand and then don\u2019t even tell Ellie (and the readers) why\u2026 That\u2019s BS! It\u2019s a cheap way to build tension. A beginner\u2019s way. Or having SOMEONE tell Ellie that she has to finish a task in a certain amount of hours and when asked why, reply with \u201cI won\u2019t tell you, but only that it\u2019s baaaaaaaaad.\u201d Taunting. That\u2019s what it is. And NO, a fake out is not okay. What\u2019s a fake out? Well, Ellie and Grandmother are sitting together and Granny is about to tell what the whole shebang is about and right when Granny is about to open her damn mouth, a freaking ELEPHANT tries to discreetly walk by the table they\u2019re sitting at to fart \u2013 okay, not really, a soccer ball lands, smashes into the dinner table, disrupting them. I mean, it might as well be a farting elephant \u2013 the ludicrousness and audacity of that fake out was horrible. It\u2019s not the only fake out. This is not good story telling. A compelling story will retain readers interest even if they knew the consequences. If coyness is the direction the story should go, there are more subtle and better ways to do it than how it was done here. (If you can see me now, I\u2019m actually clinging to the ceiling, wildly shaking and twisting my head and screaming like a banshee in irritation.) In fact, I thought this story could have definitely been interesting if it was told right, without the coyness or fake outs, but alas it was not so.Build up. Plot building. The first half was just awkward. Awkward in story telling, the way it was written, just awkward. In not a good way. When Ellie gets a taste of her new found powers, some of them she reacts to a little truthfully, others I\u2019m still reeling from the absurdity. I will buy the whole Valkyrie fighting instincts thing. I will not however buy the fact that she can hear in towns over and NOT be overwhelmed by the sounds. If she can hear a freaking dog bark in the next town, can you imagine the sounds that bombard her: the people\u2019s voices in the town she is currently in, the sounds of the multitude of cars rolling across the road, the clanks and clacks of the ship port they are in. It would absolutely overwhelm her into submission because she has NEVER experienced anything like it before. But nope, her super hearing is selective, and chooses to hear a freaking dog bark from the next town over and THEN, she\u2019s not even surprised by this. Any normal human being would be like, WTF is going on? And NO, at this point she has not come to grips with her ancestry and NO, at this point she has no idea what is actually going on at all.The romance. My eyes rolled into the back of my head so many times and I was shaking with such irritation, my family thought I was having seizures and by the eighth time they wanted to take me to see a doctor and I wanted to go because I could have describe to the doctor in great detail what my telencephalon looked like. The target coupling was obvious within the first few pages of the book. It would have been fine with the focus of the two in that relationship, because there was enough drama between the brother and what the love interest is to make it so. But nope, we have to go to Norway to find another jealous inducing stud to make this YA worthy. You get mixed messages and then at the end there\u2019s this cop out for the love triangle to end. I guess it\u2019s a good thing the triangle was not held onto, but the reason given was just so lame. Why have it in the first place?! Luckily, this book was low on the romance. Actually when I think about it, it was probably high on it but was told so awkwardly I just glazed over it (because Ellie does talks a damn lot about her love that she didn\u2019t knew she loved until 3/4 of the way into the book. *Hi, Telencephalon, nice to see you again!*). I wouldn\u2019t be this way if the book just chose to tell it straight without the pseudo-love-triangle. I think it would have been more compelling.Characters. I didn\u2019t like a single one. I hated a lot. No one had a likable quality. Ellie was too subservient to her brother Graham. Graham was a wanna be dad too much that he should have just knocked up some girl to boss around his own kid, if he wanted to be a dad so much. Now that I think about it, all the characters weren\u2019t very full. We see contours to Ellie but not enough for her to be fully human. Traits and characteristics were imposed on the characters. They didn\u2019t think/act to a specific way because their personalities demanded it but because the story demanded that they be that way for that moment because it made sense for that moment (aka typical characters in the YA trope just to move the plot along). If I saw the reason why Graham was such a tyrant of an older brother who acts like Ellie drops from his own loins, I would have bought why he was so bossy and it would pull him away from generics into real human. But that reason never came up (well, other than the reason of he loved her like a sister generic reason *Telencephalon, we got to stop meeting like this. What would people think?! Right, Right, you want to be called Cerebrum. Sorry I forgot.*). Granny had believable causes to be like the way she was, but it came off more like a plot device than Granny having to have to be that way. Tucker\u2026 attempts were made to make him whole, just didn\u2019t elaborate enough to be as such. His familial background was a plot device. Why did he \u201cfriend\u201d Ellie? We don\u2019t know. The characters in the story \u2013 sure, they\u2019re a certain personality type, but don\u2019t mistake this as them being whole, I need to know why they act the way they do. I need to empathize with them to understand what makes them human and no reasons were available from the story.Prose. I was not a fan of. Mainly because I could definitely detect the \u201cdebut\u201d in the prose. Tucker and Graham uses words that no current teen boy would use. In fact, they sound very feminine at times. The dialogue was corny in some parts, very expectant. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d When someone is intrigued by Ellie\u2019s idea (with context this would make sense \u2013 the pages around 280-286ish). Basically I knew what the characters were going to say before they even said it because the dialogue fell into the caricature trap of the good guy and bad guy, making room for only Tucker\u2019s qirk responses, which isn\u2019t enough. Moments where Ellie should be focused on a certain emotion she was focused on something else. Like the first coming into powers explanation above. While having super hearing experience, she was noting the scenery around her. Uh, no \u2013 she would be trying to understand what the hell is going on with her, and not noticing how, \u201cHeadlights flickered through the tress like lightning bugs\u201d (page 52). Though this last part was more severe in the first half than last. Once the plot details were finally all scattered to grow, the writing got better. But the initial plot planting was hard to get through at times.Overall, I just didn\u2019t like it. I liked the Norse Mythology and the last few chapters, which would probably consist of 30 or so pages but that\u2019s it. It\u2019s too bad, because underneath all these issues, I can see a very interesting story. Paulson has a great eye for action, which is good arsenal in her hands as I feel not a lot of female YA authors can write action (read fighting scenes) well.Verdict: I\u2019m going to have to say pass.Comment on the Cover: Why would they use a picture of that girl? Up close she looks like she\u2019s still hung over and/or on a drug high. The dark eyes do not work. She isn\u2019t a hideous girl, but the photo\u2019s lighting does all sorts of wrong for her. I get the mystery appeal but it did not work."}, {"userName": "~Tina~", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2594672-tina", "userReview": "4.5 starsAs much as Elle loves her brother Graham she's tired of his overprotective big brother tendencies that can gets a little out of control and even embarrassing. She feels like she'll never compare to him or his side-kick best friend, Tucker. So when Ellie leaves a week early to Norway to visit their grandmother before Graham, she's relived that she gets to spend the summer where not everyone worships the ground he walks on and she can finally let loose. But things have been strange since she's arrived. People in the town are telling her to go home and are blaming her and her grandmother for things that couldn't possibly be their fault. Teenage boys have been missing and while it's hard to believe, Ellie is starting to think the legends may be true and Valkyrie's really do exist.When Graham goes missing to, it's up to Ellie to embrace her destiny and be the Valkyrie she was born to be. With the help of Tucker, they must find a way to get Graham and the rest of the kidnapped boys back, but first Ellie must fight to prove her worth and stop Odin from building his undead army and unleashing a war to rule all.Wow, this was surprisingly good. I've always loved mythology. I admit my knowledge of Norse myths are more limited to the Thor movies then in my reading escapes, which is why I found this so refreshing and fun to read. Valkyrie Rising has a lot going for it. It's set in Norway, which I found cool since I loved reading about the land and somehow it made it more alluring. I also really enjoyed the concept of empowering fierce warrior women known as the Valkyrie and seeing how it ties in with Odin and Loki and we even have a little Celtic myth on the side to sweeten the story line even more. Ingrid Paulson is a strong writer! I loved how quickly she brings you into the heart of our main protagonist, Ellie and the conflicts that she has to face from beginning to end. I felt connected and invested with her instantly. The pace and the flow of the story was perfect. It was slow building at first, but it never felt dull or dragged out, instead it gave it that mysterious edge to keep it captivating. Once the story started to move on, the more intense it got, in both plot-action and romance.I really enjoyed every single one of these character. They are all wonderfully developed and intriguing.When we first meet Ellie, she seems like such a lost and defeated character. She may be 16 years old, but she feels like a child most of the time under Graham's watchful eye. But once Ellie gets to Norway and learns about who she truly is, she slowly but surly starts to believe that she's a lot stronger and braver then she realized and it shows when she becomes a total warrior badass.The way Ellie goes on about Graham, I thought he would end up being a jerk, but he's actually not a bad guy and only doing what a big brother is suppose to do.Then we have Tucker Halloway. Aww, Tuck, how much I adore him. The minute we meet Tuck, I knew we were gonna get along just fine. There is something very irresistible about his personality that I just want to hug. He's infuriating, sarcastic, witty with a warm smile that made my heart do flips. I also liked the secret-twist concerning his past. I never saw that one coming.But my favorite part was the sweet-as-sin romance between Tucker and Ellie. They've always had a rivalry-bantering friendship, but you could feel the longing and tension between these two in waves. The romance was so adorable. It's the kind of romance that was still in the unsure stage. New, hopeful, confusing. It's where everything is muddy at first before it becomes inevitably clear. I also loved how protective he was and how his jealousy made him deliciously sexy. I smile just thinking about them. I also really liked the other characters as well. Their Grandmother, Hilda, was wicked cool. I'd love to have a grandma like that! Astrid, Kjell and Loki also brought in the perfect amount of intrigue and entertainment into the story. Fun stuff.All in all, I was really impressed with Valkyrie Rising. The concept is fascinating, the writing is smooth and consuming and all these characters will have you invested from minute one. I'm not sure if we're getting more in this world, but I would love to see more Tucker where Paulson takes this next.

That\u2019s exactly how I ended up with Valkyrie Rising, which has been languishing on both my Kindle and my Nook for what feels like centuries in publishing years. I think that was two or three years ago? It\u2019s been a while and the TBR Jar chose it, so that was that. Nice choice, TBR Jar.Calling Ellie your average teenage girl at the beginning of the novel would be trite and overdone, but Paulson does nail how your typical teenage girl would react in the situations Ellie finds herself involved in. She\u2019s disbelieving at first, she wants no part in any of it, and she\u2019d prefer to kiss Norway goodbye as she leaves the country to its mythical problem, but she can\u2019t. Because she\u2019s stuck there and needs to get back all the young men the valkyries took away, she rises to the occasion and becomes a leader who would be right at home with the valkyries if she decided she was done living as a human.Really, Ellie\u2019s allegorical struggle with growing up and her sexuality is fantastic. I\u2019ve got a problem with one element of this, though: the talk Ellie\u2019s grandmother gives her about controlling her blooming valkyrie powers. As those powers come with heavy influence over men and are a clear allegory for sexuality, it skeeved me out a bit. Paranormal stories have always been about allegory and symbolism and I really don\u2019t like what that talk represents.Anyway, Ellie\u2019s growth as a character is believable and is paced just as well as the novel in its entirety is\u2013and let me tell you, the pacing of the plot was strong enough that I read the book in a single day. Even the romance hooked me because the dynamic between Tuck and Ellie is excellent. Flirtation from him and banter from them both made it for me and UGH, THEY\u2019RE SO CUTE I WANT TO PUKE. I\u2019m not complaining about an imbalance of power between them as a result of Ellie\u2019s valkyrie powers because the novel satisfactorily handles it. A little convenient, but it gets the job done.One other disappointment: how long it takes for the lacking portrayals of non-Ellie girls in the novel to improve. For most of the book, other girls are positioned as Ellie\u2019s adversaries because they\u2019re the super sexy, man-stealing valkyries or they\u2019re local girls who simply don\u2019t like Ellie. Thankfully, this does improve in the end and the valkyries in particular are given more nuance, but I prefer not going on the journey from \u201cother girls are bad\u201d to \u201chey, other girls rock\u201d if possible.But does Valkyrie Rising do Norse mythology, legends, and gods like Odin and Loki justice? Well, I have no idea due to a lack of familiarity. Someone else would have to critique that element for it to have weight and meaning. It could be royally screwing up everything to do with valkyries and I\u2019d know no better!If you miss the heyday of YA paranormal novels like me, Valkyrie Rising will hit the spot just right. Though it\u2019s not a standout novel, it\u2019s entertaining and it\u2019s worth a read on a lazy day when you want something fast-paced."}, {"userName": "Zemira (Kylo Ren fangirl) Warner", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4995937-zemira-kylo-ren-fangirl-warner", "userReview": "3.5 starsThe reason I read this book was that short story- Valkyrie Symptoms, which came out a couple of days ago. It\u2019s in Tucker\u2019s POV and it was so sweet. I liked the banter he shared with Ellie, kid sister of his best friend, Graham. Tucker is afraid to act on his feelings towards Ellie because he thinks her brother will not approve and doesn\u2019t want to lose their friendship. This short story is set a couple of days before Valkyrie Rising begins. It was a great introduction for the series and the only thing I didn\u2019t like is that it was too short.Valkyrie Rising starts with Ellie travelling to Norway, to visit her grandmother. After she gets there people start acting strange and they claim her grandma is a witch. A lot of young boys disappeared and people think she is responsible even though all grandma did was help out. But not all think that way. Ellie meets Kjell, a local boy who is drawn to her and they hit it off. But soon her brother and Tuck appear so we get to see Ellie interact with her brother and also Tucker teasing her. Everything doesn\u2019t go so smoothly and her brother disappears along with Kjell and grandma so Ellie begins the search with a little help from Tucker. She also discovers she is Valkyrie. That is a mythical creature from the Norse mythology. They lead dead warriors to Valhalla. The problem is that those missing boys aren\u2019t dead, which is a big no-no according to Loki, who also graces us with his presence.The first part of the book was more enjoyable, middle was messy and the ending was satisfying. The reason I didn\u2019t like the middle is that two teenagers were up against ancient mythical creatures and the managed to stay alive without any help from adult, if you don\u2019t count Loki, who didn\u2019t really help at all. He was observing, not willing to get his hands dirty. I am well aware the fact this is a story for teens but I don\u2019t get why didn\u2019t we hear from Ellie & Graham\u2019s mum at all? She just ships her kids to a different continent and doesn\u2019t bother to call them? Then grandma disappears. Sure, teens are going to save, not just the town but the world all alone. Am I the only one who notices how unrealistic and messed up this is?It could have a sequel but at the same time I feel it did solve all problems so it could work as a standalone.

The rich and refreshing setting of Norway. The way the mythology was woven nicely into the story and the fact that it was filled with badass female warriors known as the Valkyries.Ellie, the main character, was likeable and brave, and her brother's best friend and the love interest Tucker was my favorite because of his awesome personality and protectiveness of Ellie. All the characters were great and believable, and I loved how the romance played an important role that never once overshadowed everything else the book had to offer.The pace and action really began to pick up at the halfway point, but the beginning was still as intriguing as the rest of the novel. Overall, I thought Valkyrie Rising was well done and thoroughly entertaining."}, {"userName": "Pixie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4034936-pixie", "userReview": "You can also find my review on my blog The Bookaholic as part of the VALKYRIE RISING Blog Tour!I\u2019ve always been big into mythology stories. Just adore them. There\u2019s something special about how you can take these amazing legends and stories that have been passed down through the centuries and twist them around in so many different ways. Valkyrie Rising isn\u2019t any different there, and it\u2019s refreshing and beautiful. Now, I do admit that I\u2019ve never been real into the Norse mythology area. Normally, I like Celtic and Egyptian mythology. I\u2019ve also enjoyed some of the typical Greek mythology--but to be honest, I see so much of that in literature, that I\u2019ve been waiting to pick up something that\u2019s just seemingly new. I immediately felt that with this book and I was smiling like a kid in a candy shop (or maybe just feeling that high you get when you pick up a book you know will be good) from the first page. Paulson has made a fan out of me. I want more Norse mythology now. And after the amazingly gorgeous descriptions, I want to go to Norway SOON.Ellie and Graham\u2019s sibling bond strikes me to the core. I love, love, love seeing strong sibling relationships in books. I relate to them. I have a brother myself. I felt for Ellie when she was fighting for Graham. I would go to great lengths like that as well, and I\u2019m glad that her reactions to events and emotions around her were realistic. He was always protecting her, but when it came to her turn to protect him, she didn\u2019t hesitate. Ellie was a fighter, confident, and a good leader. Though had her small flaws as well. There were times she wanted to give up. She was scared. She continued to push herself. I also liked that she was hesitant and thought things through first, rather than just constantly jump ahead recklessly. She wasn't a stereotypical female character for sure. Oh Tuck. Tuck. Tuck. Tuck. Well\u2026what to say about him? He is exactly the idea of a girl\u2019s swoon-worthy crush. The brother\u2019s best friend. And it just so happens that he travels to Norway with Ellie and Graham, and ends up on the adventure with Ellie. Lovely. Of course, this makes things a bit predictable, but I really enjoyed seeing the relationship slowly build between him and Ellie while they were on the rescue mission for her brother. It\u2019s quite obvious from the very beginning he cares for her, and will protect her, just as much as he cares for his best friend. I liked this development. It wasn\u2019t insta-love because they\u2019d all grown up together. They were starting to see each other in a new light. And in reality, this happens. Paulson did an excellent job developing all of the characters, their traits, and growing relationships. I also really liked Ellie\u2019s grandmother--who was protective and fierce, though gentle and caring.You guys, I sat down to read this book and I finished within a matter of a few hours because I could not stop reading. I could just talk and talk about this book. I really could. There\u2019s so much I could continue saying. Like for example: There were these kick-ass beings called Valkyries. Not being too familiar with Norse mythology, I found them extremely fascinating. I think I could compare them to sirens or succubi in a weird sort of way. They attracted young males with their otherworldly beauty and would steal them away. Now I just want more. More, more, more. There are surprising twists throughout. It\u2019s unique. It\u2019s fantastical. I think it\u2019s a stand-alone? Which is awesome. I love stand-alones just as much as I do series books. But here's the thing: for once, I really wish there was a sequel in the works for this one. The ending was left a bit open-ended, though well resolved, and could easily turn into a fun and much loved series. I think I just wanted more Tuck and Ellie. Le sigh. Either way, I'll keep my eye out on future work of Ms. Paulson. I'm sure to love anything else. ^^It wasn\u2019t long enough!! That\u2019s the only thing where I felt like it hurt me. I wanted it to be longer. I know...repeat..but I just can't get over it. I've waited a while now to share my thoughts on it, and since finishing the book, I can't stop thinking about it. It really struck me. I don't find many in this genre that can stick out like that. I remember texting a friend halfway through reading with these exact words: \"Holy hell, you \nHAVE\n to read this book the first chance you get!\"I loved the romance and the tension and the suspense.

It seems like a normal vacation. Until Ellie is asked out by a college boy that her grandmother just happened to babysit when he was younger. They meet friends along the way \u2014 friends that seem to hate Ellie\u2019s guts the minute they get in the car. And then the most bizarre thing happens at the bar. Three \u201cbobsled\u201d girls catch the attention of everyone inside the bar. And not just the dopy-they\u2019re-hot kind of attention. This had boys and girls are turning heads with milky-white eyes. After a close call and everyone hating Ellie even more for saving Kjell\u2019s life, Ellie dreads the two weeks her brother and his best friend Tuck visit. Not just because Tuck is infuriatingly messing with her, but also the danger of 18-year-olds in Norway keeps climbing, just as the sightings of the bobseld girls increase. Tossed into the Norse and Celtic mythology, Ellie has only has hours to save the disappearing boys from Odin\u2019s growing army. And sort out Tuck\u2019s feelings for her at the same time.Good-bye Marvel\u2019s Thor and Asgard. Helllllllooo Loki and the amazing Valkyrie sisterhood (although I will always picture Loki as Tom Hiddleson). This is my first Norse/Celtic novel, and it blew away my expectations. Okay, so my expectations were based on a certain Avenger and his evil step-brother, but hey, it\u2019s always nice to be surprised. In this story, Loki is hovering over the good-bad fence and Odin (god of wisdom and such) is the evil one. Ellie is a Valkyrie \u2014 someone who takes fallen soldiers and puts them in Odin\u2019s growing army. But Valkyries are only supposed to take dead boys. But Astrid and her sisterhood are kidnapping alive 18+ all across Norway. At first Ellie shrugs it off as a scared populace. But when her brother is kidnapped and her grandmother is taken, Ellie has no choice but to embrace her Valkyrie heritage and fight \u2014 even if she has to make a deal with Loki.The romance! It is sooooo sweet and heart wrenching and a tad predictable, but hey it still had me flipping pages. I loved Tuck from the very first scene, even if he was drunk and a smarty-pants. His sarcasm and constant (well usually) bickering with Ellie kept the romance light and mysterious. And he has as secret!! (It seems like all YA boys have secrets nowadays.)The intertwining of Norse and Celtic mythology was flawless. The history of Norse gods and goddesses are so interesting, plus I just love Loki. He isn\u2019t on team good or evil. He\u2019s more of a team for himself. And his actions might just be on both ends of the spectrum. As long has he gets his way in the big picture.Story = amazing. Writing = faced paced. Characters = strong. Romance = mysterious. Valkyrie Rising is a book of epic proportions and I cannot wait until the next installment.Notable Scene: \u201cWhat\u2019s your price, Loki?\u201d Astrid forced the words out from between clenched teeth. \u201cEven if Elsa didn\u2019t have such foresight, I\u2019m not agreeing to anything unless you tell me all the terms.\u201d\u201cBut you will, Astrid,\u201d Loki said, stretching. \u201cBecause your trust is a condition of my silence. When the time comes, rest assured you\u2019ll have no choice but to give me what I want. Until then, your secret is safe with me.\u201dAstrid actually looked startled as she eyed Loki. She growled low in her throat. \u201cCleverness won\u2019t mend a broken neck.\u201d\u201cJust like violence doesn\u2019t resolve conflict,\u201d Loki said. \u201cit just begets more violence. It\u2019s unfortunate for you that the same isn\u2019t true of cleverness.\u201d Loki was the only one who laughed at his joke. \u201cOdin may still delude himself,\u201d Loki drawled. \u201cBut I think you see the nuances of his modern world. You understand that true peace comes through negotiation. Compromise. And don\u2019t you worry, we\u2019ll reach one.\u201dFTC Advisory: Harper Teen provided me with a copy of Valkyrie Rising.

Actually, that's what my friend suggested when I tried to explain the plot of Valkyrie Rising to her. I'll admit that she does have a point, but, hey, I prefer some well-done variation to consistent repetition of vampires, werewolves, witches, etc.NGL, I hardly know anything about Norse mythology. My childhood mythology obsession only stretched as far as Greek and Roman, so do not expect this review to critique the accuracy of Paulson's take on Odin and Valkyries. I can't tell you that. What I can tell you is that this book was just so fun, and that I loved the Valkyries. I mean, who doesn't love a group of hot girls who can destroy anyone with their physical prowess and mind powers? Sure, some of them are a little bit evil, but they're still really interesting, which is clearly the most important thing.I completely loved the first half of this novel, before the paranormal elements really entered the scene, not that I didn't like those but they weren't my favorite part. What I loved was the dynamic between Ellie and Tuck. They have this snarky back-and-forth banter, a mutual loathing/attraction, that I find incredibly compelling. Basically, they remind me a whole lot of Benedick and Beatrice (couple name: Beatrick) from Much Ado About Nothing. Given that they are perhaps my OTP, that's seriously high praise from me. The best moments are when Ellie and Tuck really get the insults flying thick and fast.Ellie comes across as a real teenage girl to me, awkward and rebellious and lonely and without an accurate sense of herself. Graham, Ellie's perfect older brother, basically runs her life, keeping guys from dating her, because of an uncomfortable instance one time, and making sure she sticks to curfew. Ellie resents this, but cannot find the will to act out, because she basically hero-worships Graham. Their relationship reminded me a lot of Lugh and Saba in Blood Red Road, especially in the later discovery that the younger sister turns out to be much stronger.I bonded with Ellie almost immediately, alone at a party, unsure whether to join or to hide. She feels uncomfortable in her own skin and no longer knows if she's a social pariah because of herself or her brother. When she goes to stay with her grandmother in Norway, she arrives before her brother and Tuck. She meets a really hot guy, cuter even than Tuck and older too, Kjell, and he asks her out. She agrees to go in a fit of rebellion. Though he's gorgeous, she does not trust him one bit, and has little to no interest in him. This made me want to fistbump Ingrid Paulson for letting a heroine care more about personality than looks.I will say, though, that aside from Tuck and Ellie who I loved, the rest of the characters did not seem particularly well-developed. I really don't have a sense of any of them as people, even Graham, which might be part of why I dislike him so much. This dovetails with my other complaint: this should be a series. The story does wrap up, but it's open-ended. So far as I know, a sequel isn't in the works, but it should be, and then we could see the other characters grow more.Valkyrie Rising is just a heck of a lot of fun, with the added bonus of a unique setting in small town Norway. I loved reading it and will be keeping an eye on Paulson's career from here on out."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5028591-andrea", "userReview": "** 2.5 Stars**You know what's hard about writing reviews? Trying to write a review for a book that didn't elicit in either direction. Valkyrie Rising wasn't a bad book; I found the story to be a bit interesting at times. But I also can't say that it is a great book, either. I just found myself simply not caring about the story or the characters. So basically, I feel as if I'm grasping for something to say.I'm certain part of the problem is that I'm discovering that I'm just not into Valkyries. And to this you're probably thinking \"Well, Andrea, why did you pick up a book titled 'Valkyrie Rising'?\" I decided to read Valkyrie Rising because it was sent to me by a publicist (Thanks to Harper Teen!) and I gave it a shot to see if maybe I do like Valkyries, but hadn't found the right book yet.Another reason I didn't connect to the book was that I felt the author used a lot of telling instead of showing. For example, at one point Ellie gains the ability to hear voices. But instead of \"showing\" the effect it had on her brain by making me feel as if I were experiencing it with her, the ability is simply told:\"Just when I thought things couldn't get any weirder, a strange voice sounded in my head, one that was me and wasn't me. Like it came from a new part of my consciousness I hadn't had the chance to meet yet.\" Those lines didn't make me feel anything. I just know that \"Oh,a new ability popped up at an awfully handy time.\" Which leads me to my next gripe. I am not a fan of stories in which the characters just magically develop abilities whenever it's convenient. Ellie randomly develops the ability to understand the language, she suddenly can hear thoughts, can fight when she's never been trained. I get that this helps keep the pace moving quickly, but I like for my characters to work for a payoff. So what did I like about Valkyrie Rising? I liked the setting. The author painted a lovely picture of Norway, a location I've not experienced in books. Also, Tuck. If not for Tuck, I don't know that I would have enjoyed the story at all. He was funny, charming, adventurous, and charismatic. I loved the effect he had on Ellie. He made every scene he was in better, and I missed him when he was off scene. Valkyrie Rising was an \"okay\" book for me. I didn't love it; I didn't hate it.

The cover, the Norwegian setting and the idea of Valkyries just captured my imagination. Wow was I disappointed! I almost put it down about 6 times.The story is about Ellie, her brother Graham, and his best friend Tuck who are spending the summer with their grandmother in Norway. But strange things are happening in their quiet town and Ellie finds herself in the middle of it all.This book is SLOW! For 140 pages Ellie wonders around Hicks Ville Norway thinking to herself \u201chmm something strange is going on here\u2026\u201d but never really confronts anyone about it, avoids the subject when other people want to speak to her about it and fails to warn her brother when she know he is in danger. I don\u2019t think I really need to add that she is not a likeable character! Then all of a sudden within the space of 2 pages BAM she realizes she is a Valkyrie, knows how to fight, has super powers and is ready to kick ass. There is no build up to this discovery or learning process. In an instant she just becomes a \u201csuper warrior\u201d and is totally unfazed by it all. What made this development even more infuriating for me was that the plot was SO predictable, the only thing I had to look forward to, was how Ellie was going to be effect when she realized she was a Valkyrie. But it was just glossed over.The rest of the book is spent chasing around the other valkyries searching for Ellie\u2019s brother. Unfortunately the author has done such a mediocre job at creating characters that I really didn\u2019t care if they found the guy or not. To be honest I would have been more concerned if they had kidnapped a puppy. (And I\u2019m not even a dog person.)There is the constant threat that Ellie is going to step up and kick someone\u2019s ass but she never does. It\u2019s all talk and no action. And that is not the only thing that fizzles. The romance between Ellie and Tuck just has no spark or tension. Tuck seems to be a better side-kick then a love interest.So to recap. The plot was thin and predictable the characters were unlikeable and one dimensional and nothing of interest ever really happens.

His protectiveness also sounds rather familiar (all those cute boys who wouldn\u2019t look at me cuz of my damned brothers, sigh!). I found the novel to be vastly entertaining and very engaging. It is total fluff \u2013 enjoyable fluff and I did enjoy reading it. I found the setting a welcome change from the usual settings of YA paranormals and would have loved a bit more description of the area but that\u2019s just me. The pacing is quick and events progress quite rapidly. I also liked the portrayal of Loki, the trickster god. The love interest is very swoonworthy and the way Paulson describes him, I wouldn\u2019t mind having a boy-next-door if that\u2019s how they come (they don\u2019t, I know for a fact, the boy next door to me is 12 and a brat).There were a few aspects of the novel that gave me pause. Ellie\u2019s complete obliviousness that Tuck likes her.

Why would he mess around with a sixteen year old when he would be able to fry hotter fish with the Valkyrie in power, Astrid?

It was action-packed and I was sucked in to the story. The stakes just kept getting higher and higher in Valkyrie Rising and I was definitely rooting for Ellie to kick everyone's ass.I know next to nothing about Norse mythology and I loved what information Ingrid Paulson gave us in Valkyrie Rising. She worked a lot of the mythology into the story without it seeing like sort of an info dump and more just a natural part of Ellie's tale.

There was quite a bit of swooning.There were several twists throughout Valkyrie Rising - some I expected and some I definitely didn't. Basically, if you're looking for an action-packed book featuring a kickass protagonist, a swoony romance, and mythology you probably don't know too much about, check out Valkyrie Rising by Ingrid Paulson for sure!"}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5463965-heidi", "userReview": "Three and a half stars: A book that takes us to Norway and introduces us to the mythological Valkyries and Odin.Ellie at sixteen has spent the majority of her young life in her brother's golden shadow. Graham is successful in almost everything. He is the perfect older brother, despite the fact that he is fiercely protective of Ellie. If any boy even looks in her direction he is there to fend them off. Ellie and Graham are headed to Norway for the summer to spend some time with their Grandma Hilda. Much to Ellie's dismay, at least she pretends to be dismayed, Tucker, Graham's best friend, will be accompanying them as well. Once Ellie arrives in Norway she find things are not quite right. Handsome and popular boys over the age of eighteen are mysteriously disappearing. Worse, people are casting suspicious glances at Ellie and her grandmother as if they are somehow responsible for the kidnappings. When Ellie comes face to face with the real perpetrators she realizes that perhaps her vision of the world is limited and perhaps they are supernatural entires. Ellie fears for Graham's safety and she is determined to make sure that he doesn't fall victim. Can Ellie somehow find a way to stop the Valkyries from stealing her brother? What I Liked:*I am always excited when I run across a book with an original paranormal element and storyline so I was thrilled to find in Rise of the Valkyries a modern vision of the Norse mythological Valkyries. The Valkyries are fierce maidens who brought the best of the best soldiers after they died to serve in Odin's army. The Valkyries are back in modern times and this time they are stealing the brightest of the living. These girls are gorgeous and deadly and definitely a bit scary. Needless to say, this book gave me something different and unique and I loved the use of Nordic mythology.*I adored the strong sibling relationship in this one. Graham is extremely protective of his younger sister so much that it is to the point where is overly protective. I am a big fan of books that feature great brother-sister relationships and this one has a duo with an amazing bond. I loved that both Ellie and Graham were willing to sacrifice and go to great lengths to protect each other.*I enjoyed watching Ellie grow. At the beginning, she comes across as a girl who is always hiding in her brother's long shadow. Graham is popular, handsome, athletic and draws attention wherever he goes, while Ellie is quiet, a bit shy and never in the limelight. She doesn't even date since Graham disapproves of every eligible boy. As the story progresses, Ellie realizes she has some extraordinary powers and she quickly learns to wield them in order to protect the ones she loves. By the end of the book, Ellie transforms into a strong, capable, fierce girl who is willing to take on insurmountable odds to save her brother. She definitely comes a long way. She even takes a stand against Graham and refuses to let him make all her decisions for her and she finally finds her voice. *Tucker, the swoon worthy, witty, boy next door who secretly has a crush on Ellie. He is one of those boys with charm and a smile that will melt your heart. I loved that he and Ellie had been secretly crushing on each other for years but were afraid to acknowledge their feelings. This is one of those romances that is hesitant and awkward as two longtime friends finally realize their feelings for each other. I really enjoyed the romance in this one.*I loved that this book refrained from cliffhangers and love triangle and it had an exciting mystery, great characters and blended mythological characters into a modern day setting. Not to mention it had a couple of unexpected twists. And The Not So Much:*One of my biggest complaints was that there was some predictability in this one. If the Valkyrie are taking the best and the brightest boys over the age of eighteen who do you think would be a likely target? I was frustrated that Ellie and even her grandmother knowing all this didn't do more to protect the boys. *I was disappointed a bit in Ellie at times. She immediately finds herself in a strange situation and she knows that her grandmother is aware of what is going on. Yet, she doesn't confront her grandmother and express her concern for the safety of her brother. Furthermore, when the her grandmother tries to sit her down and talk to her, she avoids the issues. That was a sticking point for me. I felt that she should have been a bit more savvy and tried harder to talk to her grandma and to explain to Graham what was going on. I felt, it got to the point where it got to be a bit unbelievable. *I felt like I never had a true picture of Hilda. In fact, I didn't connect with her and didn't really like her. I did not like the way that she refused to step up and confront the disappearances especially when she knew what was going on. Furthermore, I never had a true sense of who she was. Why she made some of her decisions and so forth. I would have liked to know a bit more about her history and I would like to have seen more development in regards to her character.*Finally, I was left wondering what happened to Ellie's and Graham's father. He died but what was he like? How did he die and did he inherit anything special from his mother? Ellie and Graham's parents are nonexistent in this one.Rise of the Valkyrie is a fun book with a fresh take on Nordic mythology. I loved the mystery, action and sweet romance in this one. It has an unexpected story line along with good world building and memorable characters. If you are in need of something different give this one a read. Favorite Quotations:\"Something tells me you won\u2019t want to show your face in public wrapped in an old lady\u2019s tracksuit.\u201d\"I shifted until I could covertly watch her reaction as I backed up and dumped a whole truckload of crazy at her feet.\"\"The words were warm against my cheek, as was the scent of reckless summer radiating from his skin.\"\"I knew I\u2019d been forgiven, no matter how much my words had hurt him, because there was a connection between the two of us, an affection born of a common childhood, the roots of our lives inextricably tangled.

Probably because it is another debut novel read for me, and I have to give the author and editing team credit. It could have been awful, but it wasn't. I had fun and I never knew what to expect. I even laughed out loud a couple of times. I am probably not the target audience, but I can still enjoy a YA romp in Norway with a group of bad ass Valkyrie super models and a couple of love sick teen agers. Throw in a couple of Norse Gods, and I can be quite happy. I read this book for a team toppler event and a task on my yearly challenge list. Win - Win!"}, {"userName": "nick ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2993271-nick", "userReview": "I've been pining for Valkyrie Rising ever since I saw the cover and read the title. YA has explored endless paranormal creatures from vampires to aliens. Yet, Valkyries are pretty new to the genre. So, you can imagine how excited I was when I realized that this book was going to be based on Norse mythology. Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed.When Ellie, along with her older brother, Graham, travel to Norway to spend the summer with their grandmother, Ellie's life changes for good. In the small town where her grandmother resides, young boys are swiftly going missing and rumors of Valkyries are slowly spreading through the community. Ellie doesn't realize the extent of the kidnappings until her own brother goes missing. Now, along with Tuck, Graham's sarcastic and humorous best friend, she must do everything possible to save her brother and along the way she learns about the ancient mysteries surrounding her.At the beginning of the book, the reader is introduced to Ellie, a smart, but shy girl who has always been known as \"Graham's younger sister\". Ellie doesn't like being in the shadow of her older brother and she wants nothing more than to be known for herself, but it's not easy for her considering her brother is very overprotective of his baby sister. At first, I thought Ellie's character was bland, but as the story progressed she underwent a tremendous growth, easily making her one of my favorite female YA characters. Seeing her grow as I read the book was very much a pleasant experience since her maturing process was realistic. As a reader, I could see what propelled her towards such an incredible growth. By the end of the book, she had shed her mousy appearance to become a fearless tigress. There's nothing more I enjoy reading than characters who grow due to circumstances, so you can see why I adored Ellie's character. Moreover, Ellie was a down-to-earth girl that I could easily see myself becoming friends with. Her friendly personality was yet another appealing trait of hers. Although I really liked Ellie as a protagonist, my favorite character in the book was Tuck. He was such a fun character to read about. He was a sarcastic, but not overly sarcastic that he appeared conceited, and absolutely lovable character. He would make the wittiest of comments in the most serious situations and that would make me grin like crazy. I thought that the secondary characters were also really well fleshed-out. They all had distinct personalities and I never felt like they were underdeveloped. All in all, the characters in Valkyrie Rising were fantastic.Since Valkyrie Rising is set in Norway, I was expecting it to be highly descriptive and to have a strong world-building. And thankfully, I was right. The world building was absolutely mesmerizing. Ingrid Paulson ensures that her readers thoroughly understand what's going on with her setting. I thought that the mythology in the book was rich and very knowledgeable. Ingrid Paulson went to lengths, making sure that there are no holes in her world-building. Complex, but rich, the world-building was fascinating. I honestly felt like I was with Ellie in her world. The plot itself was mysterious and highly entertaining. I did feel like in some places, the plot didn't move much, but for the most part it was intense, fast-paced and very addictive. The author maintained the element of secrecy and mystery, making me very curious to find out what was going on. I also enjoyed the different relationships that existed in the book.. The relationship between Ellie and Graham was one of the highlights of the book for me. I loved the deep sibling bond that they shared. It was heartfelt and realistic. The romance between Ellie and Tuck was simply put, perfect. There was nothing instant about it since they've known forever. Moreover, it progressed at a slow pace, never taking over the plot, instead developing at the same time as the plot. The author's writing was addictive and I strongly believe that she will become very well known in the YA world if she keeps on writing this well. To sum up, Valkyrie Rising was an original, highly entertaining and riveting story with characters that enraptured me. I do not hesitate at all to recommend this book to all fans of YA paranormal looking for something fresh with a kick-butt heroine and an exciting plot-line."}, {"userName": "Jen (The Starry-Eyed Revue)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4659650-jen-the-starry-eyed-revue", "userReview": "***4 1/2 stars***I am so unbelievably ashamed of myself for putting this book off for so long. I daresay I had the galley in my possession for a few months before I even cracked it open. And then I remembered the allure of that cover, and the pull of Norse mythology reminded me why I wanted to read the book in the first place. I love mythology, any kind and of any origin, in all of its various permutations over the years and through various retellings. Can't get enough of the stuff. And the fact that I knew next to nothing about Norse mythology intrigued me beyond belief. Again, why didn't I read this novel sooner???I've heard the term valkyrie before, but in case you weren't aware, a valkyrie is \"each of Odin's twelve handmaidens who conducted the slain warriors of their choice from the battlefield to Valhalla\". You don't need to know that going into this story because the author does such a splendid job of explaining the mythology in the book -- without going overboard with the details, I might add -- that you'll pick it up fairly quickly. But it always helps to be prepared...just ask Elsa. ;0)I don't normally say this, but I would totally like to see this book made into a movie. Norway as the backdrop for all of the action would be gorgeous. And I've already got the head Valkyrie cast....as well as many of the other characters. But Astrid was the first one I had pegged down. I'm serious people...I'm never able to cast a book, but these characters are so clearly defined, even as they waver in their beliefs, that I knew exactly who should play the parts. Scary.That synopsis might make it sound like the romance is first and foremost in this book, but let me tell you, Valkyrie Rising is equal parts action, danger, romance and myth. No one aspect stands out more to me than the others. And I loved every bit of it...from Elsa finding out who (and what) she was to her taking on her nemesis even when she was likely to be defeated to the swoonage between Elsa and Tuck, the ever-persuasive boy-next-door. Yes, it's safe to say that this story far exceeded my expectations.I laughed out loud, I whooped in celebration, and I stared in open-mouth shock at times. This novel brings it. There's family drama. There's boy drama. There's really-beautiful-girls-who-want-to-destroy-the-world-on-Odin's-behalf drama. And it gets intense at times. If I had to compare it to any of my recent reads, I'd have to go with Maggie Stiefvater's The Scorpio Races, due to the mystical mythology, the will-they-or-won't-they aspect, and just the way that the setting is like another character in the story. There's also a touch of humor in both stories that just feels so authentic, so true to the characters. You don't have to enjoy mythological tales to appreciate this story...it's simply the kind of book that will speak to your sense of adventure and make you wish that your grandmother had passed down some extraordinary genes to you.Favorite quotes:\"Last name too? Bad sign. But here goes.\" He leaned closer, knowing full well how destabilizing his proximity could be. Before I could help it, I was batting my eyelashes right back at him. A reflex as involuntary as the knee-jerk test at the doctor's office.\"He laughed. It was a noteworthy event--his teeth were so straight it wouldn't have surprised me if he said he'd had braces twice. But his smile was crooked. It was the best possible combination.\"\"We should call the police,\" Tuck said.\"And tell them what, exactly,\" I said. \"That we think Valkyries kidnapped my brother? And attacked my grandmother? Maybe we should interrogate all the other fictional creatures, starting with the Easter Bunny?\" I knew I wasn't being helpful, but my frustration was screaming for an out.\"Leave the Easter Bunny out of it,\" Tuck murmured. \"I know that dude has an alibi.\"Thanks to HarperCollins for providing a review copy and to Shane at Itching for Books for hosting the blog tour.This review can also be found at The Starry-Eyed Revue."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8461217-emily", "userReview": "I cannot believe how much I loved this book, I mean likeBAM!I mean Valkyries? I have never read many books of this kind. So little these days have Valkyries. And Ingrid makes me love Valkyries. RATING: 4.50That was my reaction to the cover. And this Was my reaction to the plot. As you can probably already tell, I absolutely loved Valkyrie Rising. It has an original plot, I have not come across many books with good/bad valkyries before. However, initially, I found the story a bit dry with all the details and descriptions and blah blah blah. Where was the action?! But after a while, when all the action and fun began, I was at the edge of my seat. Drop-dead gorgeous, kick-ass, tall women? I'm all in.  Re-reading it later, I began to understand why all the details and descriptions were so important. They were all building up to that big finale. In other words, I loved it. Ingrid is just one fab writer. Need I say any more? I mean, I mostly say authors are fab authors, but Ingrid is like BOOM superstar. Ellie. She was like this awkward, socially awkward, teen, and then with all the events she goes through, she becomes stronger. Literally. In both aspects, physically and psychologically. I truly admired her. She was also a kick-ass heroine. And I have a thing for kick-ass heroines. Just sayin'. That's what bought me.  Tucker Halloway. I know... I probably have a long list of book boyfriends already, but I honestly,  have  to add him. He is so sarcastic, witty, and hilarious, protective and passionate. I don't know. He isn't perfect either. He has this total \"playboy\" reputation going on, (though honestly, he isn't) and he can be such a punk, but I think that just what made me love him more. Honestly, I don't have a thing for playboys, but this is TUCKER people! One cannot shove Tucker aside. Besides, he isn't a playboy. He just has that reputation. My heart nearly broke with that revelation that he was actually-- nope. Not saying. But I could have cried. It's like Astley with Frank and Zara all over again. Ugh. How I hate those. I had my ups and downs with Graham, but in the end I decided I kind of liked him. He was nice, overbearing at times, but he was still... nice. Yeah he's popular, but you can still tell loves Ellie in his own protective way but he doesn't shove her aside because he's popular and she's not. That I liked. Loki. At first I thought I liked him, but in the end, I didn't. But I still do believe that maybe in that dark, twisted soul of his, he might have loved Ellie. Maybe. Gram. I have a love-hate relationship with that woman. She wouldn't have been in that list if she didn't keep so many important secrets from Ellie. I'm still not sure if she redeemed herself in the end. The romance. Ah. Sometimes, I was (like I always do) screaming at Tucker and Ellie to just kiss. I mean, damn Graham. Damn you. You are irrelevant. Anyways, it was really sweet, and I liked the way it built up, and it was so cute in the end when Ellie thought Tucker was under some kind of spell. Heehee. But I hated that twist. But I'm glad they were able to overcome their differences in the end. I couldn't have been more satisfied with the ending. It was wrapped up nicely. But I just wished there would be a sequel. That would be awesome-sauce :) All in all, I loved Valkyrie Rising, and no doubt that i'll be re-reading it and reading Ingrid's future works."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3736122-katie", "userReview": "Similar Books: Starling by Lesley Livingston, Loki's Wolves by Kelley Armstrong and Melissa Marr, The Weight of Stars by Tessa Gratton, Touch of Frost by Jennifer EstepRating: 3 1/2 starsI'm a huge mythology fan, and I think Norse might be one of my favorites (tied with Greek and Indian). So I was REALLY excited to get an ARC of Valkyrie Rising. I loved the hint of Norse myths that the blurb promised and the idea that the book was set in Norway. (I love a good foreign setting!) And while this was a solid debut, I found myself slightly disappointed.Let me explain.When I read a book based on mythology, I tend to want something more akin to urban fantasy - with really strong worldbuilding and appearances by gods and other creatures. I want the story to be so steeped in mythology that I lose myself in the world. A book that comes to mind is Tiger's Curse by Colleen Houck - she utilizes so many different types of Indian mythology to craft her world. Starling by Lesley Livingston is another example.But Ingrid Paulson chose a different path: to take one sliver of the mythology and craft her world from that, as opposed to the entirety. She focuses exclusively on Valkyries and their powers. It reminded me of Fury by Elizabeth Miles, which focused only on the Furies of Greek mythology. And for me, I tend to be a little unsatisfied with so little myth.So my main complaint with the book has less to do with Ms. Paulson's writing abilities or her ability to create an interesting story and more with personal preference.Because this book is written very well! The pacing is great, the characterizations are interesting, and the love interest is swoonworthy. This is also very much of a \"girl power\" book, and I think lots of readers will like that. But at the end of the day, it feels very much like a paranormal book instead of this epic fantasy that I was hoping it would be.Still, I think this is a strong debut. I loved the setting! And I think Ellie is a smart protagonist that makes a lot of mature decisions that readers will appreciate, I feel. For one, she's not totally enamored by the local boy who mysteriously falls for her basically at first glance. She also values her own independence more than power. I think Ellie will resonate with a lot of readers who are sick of the \"too-stupid-to-live heroines\" that many characters are accused of being.I also liked Tuck, the love interest, especially at the beginning. He's really funny and charming, and I might have swooned a little over him in the first 50 pages. But as the story progressed, I found him less interesting as he becomes less significant to the plot. I understood that this was Ellie's story and so she was the main focus, but I tend to like love interests that have their own character arcs and are integral to the story.I'm looking forward to more books by Ms. Paulson in the future. I think she's a really good writer! And while the worldbuilding in this story wasn't my cup of tea, I think a lot of people will enjoy the sprinkling of mythology in a story that's very much of a coming-of-age, coming-into-her own kind of book."}, {"userName": "Eliza Baum", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5834453-eliza-baum", "userReview": "[Tucker also has some distant Valkyrie blood (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Emily Anne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13045626-emily-anne", "userReview": "Oooh, I really enjoyed this book! And after that synopsis how could you not expect to love it? Valkyrie Rising is an action packed novel that sucked me in and kept me in Norway until I finished the book... amazing! I am so excited to tell everyone about this book...The characters were nothing short of amazing. Ellie was a great and relatable (and sarcastic) character. I enjoyed reading the story from her perspective. Also, her brother, Graham was a vivid character who learns the some valuable lessons about being a big brother. Tuck, Graham's friend, was also pretty great. Astrid, an evil valkyrie in the beginning, was also fun to read about because her personality and traits were unique and vivid. I hope we see more of all these characters in the second book.Okay, Norse mythology. Kidnappings. Valkyries. What could be cooler? This novel definitely had a plot to die for. The audience will never be bored, or at least I never was, with all the end-of-your-seat action. I think I read this in half the airplane ride. (P.S This is fun to read on a plane because then you can pretend to be going to Norway!)There were several \"plots\" (I may be using this term loosely.) One was about the kidnapping of young men in the Norwedgian fishing village. Another one was the war including the gods. There was the part where Ellie tries to figure out some family secrets, and what she is. And finally, there was the romance between Ellie and Tuck, plus the relationship between Ellie and Graham. All these \"plots\" joined together to make an awesome story!The conclusion solves most everything and there was no cliff-hanger, which I liked. However, there is definitely room for more books in the series. And I hope the second one comes out soon! I want more gods, goddesses, valkyries, and action! What will happen next in the war of the gods?Overall, Valkyrie Rising was an epic read.
