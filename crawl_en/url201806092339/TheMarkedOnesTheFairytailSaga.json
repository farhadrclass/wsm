I'll let the other wonderful mer-fiction writer's tell you a tale about underwater kingdoms and inter-species battles... if that's what you're after, read those because in my world, Mermaids live among us, spend as much time with two legs as they do their tails and are slaves to their wants, needs and the environment.... oh and they raise hell.Just to preface, The Fairytail Saga is set in Australia with characters from across the globe, and is a knock 'em down, drag 'em out Love triangle which gets a tiny bit (okay a lot) erotic in PLACES ( this is not erotica- but hotter ;) and I don't recommend it for readers under the 'smouldering' age or those opposed to the occasional cuss word, that isn't written like: Cuss. This book will frustrate the hell out of most readers- and I pride myself on that! Before the conclusion, I'm going to make you want to track me down and throttle me BUT hopefully you do so with a song in your heart and a really big crush on one of the absolutely wonderful heroes or heroines. And just be warned, I do Happily Ever Afters.... I just drag you through the forest naked and fighting for your life first and twist when you least expect it ;)"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10248156-rebecca", "userReview": "I LOVED this book!!

The boy who visited his grandparents next door to you.\u00a0 They were there every year and things developed from a simple \u2018like\u2019 to something you dreamed about from the moment autumn breezes began to blow until the time when school was out and the summer really began. You saw them every summer until you didn\u2019t and wondered where they were and what had happened to keep them away. Most of us got over those crushes and relegated them to the fond memories box in the back of our minds.For some of us though, the emotional wound failed to heal when school started up again and festered inside of us for years afterward. The long-needed healing would only come when we finally saw them again ten or fifteen years later and discovered that the perfect person from summers long ago suddenly had a beer-belly, six screaming kids, copious tattoos or all of the above. Reality can be a bite but it can also be a great curative.Sometimes though, reality can only make things worse. Lincoln Grey is one such victim. He has carried a torch all this time for his long-lost summer love and the years have not been kind to him. Although he\u2019s only twenty-eight, he appears to be in his forties. Hard work and the sense of loss that just won\u2019t go away have sapped his joie de vivre and aged him beyond his years. He is the reality that his summer crush will see when she returns to the resort where they met so many years ago. She seems to have not aged a day and yet so much has taken place in the interval. Even so, that long-forgotten lamp in the dark reaches of her heart is still lit and soon makes its presence known.Her name is Ivyanne - this reviewer so wishes that he had a daughter to bestow this moniker upon - and her life of privilege is very complicated. She is pursued by three suitors amongst who she must choose a mate within the relatively near future. She has already been promised twice before and in each case, the intended lost his life. Suddenly, Lincoln is a dark-horse fourth candidate for a match that can never take place for you see, Ivyanne is a princess and . . . a mermaid. And so begins a tale of emotional conflict, lies, deceit, forbidden love and broken hearts. The happy ending almost seems to be an endangered species.Ivyanne is shocked both to discover her long-lost love at the resort and to see the physical and emotional state that he is in. She wants Lincoln to be able to move on with his life and find whatever his destiny may be. It won't include her but she wants him to be happy so she herself can move on as well. After all, she is responsible - at least indirectly - for his present condition.Ivyanne landed her job at the resort solely upon the recommendation of some of the other merfolk who work there. One such person is the lady who runs the spa. Ivyanne asks/commands - she is a princess after all - that Lincoln be given a bit of the spa treatment usually reserved for other merfolk with the reasoning that if some of the decade's worth of physical damage is erased, he will feel better about himself and will be more attractive to human females. If he feels better, then she will feel better about what has happened.Or so she thinks. The best laid plans oft go astray and this one will be a prime example. Lincoln has his afternoon at the spa and subsequently attends the staff beach party later that evening. Everyone is shocked and amazed . . . most of all, Ivyanne . . . to see the difference that a single afternoon has wrought on Lincoln. In that pivotal moment, she discovers that her feelings for him are deeper and more alive than she thought. One of her three suitors notices this as well.And what was the deal with the human? Ardhi hadn\u2019t been close enough to hear them conversing, but he\u2019d seen Ivyanne\u2019s face alight with animation-seen her knock back a full drink in one gulp the moment the tall man had loped away. She\u2019d then turned to the ocean, and rested her hand against her heart with a ridiculously moved smile on her face. A smile Ardhi had never seen before. A smile no human should be capable of gleaning from their princess.S.K. Munt has penned a smart, compelling and emotionally wrenching story that is difficult to put aside. It is book one in her Fairytail trilogy and is an impressive debut. \nThe Marked Ones\n is a fish in a very small pool of adult _ with a little \u2018a\u2019 - mermaid/man fantasy novels. The recent upwelling of mer-fiction has been mostly limited to the Young Adult market. While so much of that sub-genre contains well-written tales of sub-aquatic teen angst, there are those of us who long to read a good story of sub-aquatic adult angst now and then.The Marked Ones differs from the all too common adult story where a so-so plot is used to tie together a series of hot sex scenes. Throw in the aquatic angle and you have a tale of tails and titillation. This is not to say that there is nothing steamy about Ms Munt\u2019s novel. There is one scene covering two chapters that is guaranteed to curl your tail-fin but that is the only one requiring a cold shower. Without a doubt, The Marked Ones is probably unsuitable for all but the very upper end of the YA range. Nonetheless, there are some of those who will discover it just as this reviewer discovered Herman Wouk\u2019s Marjorie Morningstar in the 11th grade. Unless they have led sheltered lives, readers in the awkwardly named \"New Adult\" category will be able to relate to the story along with the general adult population.\nThe Marked Ones\n is a good . . . really, really good . . . read.\u00a0By all means, buy a copy of this novel and read it for the mer-folk, read it for the drama, read it for the heartbreak and read it for the unexpected ending. In all respects, the story is a memorable and well told tale. This reviewer is left with the feeling that this novel is merely a knock-up and there are greater things to come from S.K. Munt. She is an up and coming author that fans of this genre would do well to keep an eye on.There are two more installments in this series and this reviewer is eagerly awaiting their release. Once you have read \nThe Marked Ones\n, you will too.Read my interview with S.K.

I want to hold up a poster and run around telling everyone to read this series, but that would be weird so I\u2019ll stick to writing a review about how awesome this series is. I rarely ever find a book series where I can come back to it and not be as engrossed into it as the first time, but I\u2019ve read this three times now and I love it just as much as the first, the only thing I regret is not finding out about it sooner. I loved the writing, the mermaid mythology, the setting and the characters\u2019 (maybe not Lincoln but that\u2019s because Tristan outshines everyone and he was standing in the way of the most beautiful ship ever). \nThe story is set in Australia, and S.K Munt\u2019s description of the sunny resort really makes me want to go down under, I\u2019m actually going to go and try to find some mermaids. Well maybe not mermaids, but I can hope to find a Tristan Loveridge right? \nOur heroine is a mermaid princess; Ivyanne Court, she is beautiful and currently frustrated; she has to choose between three potential suitors for marriage that will carry on her bloodline. \nTo get some breathing space to think (away from the very persistent infatuated best friend Ardhi) she works at the Seaview. And then we get introduced to a ton of new characters, her childhood love Lincoln, who is still very much in love with her the other mermaid workers and the very sexy Tristan. The focal point of this story is a love triangle that had me wanting to rip my hair out but I loved every bit of it, be warned I only loved it this much because Ivyanne ended up with the right guy (according to me). The writing is very refreshing, and the third person perspective allows us to get insight into all the character\u2019s minds, I would have probably gone crazy in just Ivyanne\u2019s head. My previous experiences with mermaids books has been terrible (Syrena series) which is why I was reluctant to read this novel but I thank my lucky stars I took the risk and discovered one of the best books I have read in a very long time."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6589908-jen", "userReview": "This series will become a world wide phenomenon!

BUT guess what? S.K. Munt pulls you into her story like a tidal wave. The Marked Ones successfully finds a way to show three very different and genuine love stories\u2014 one that originates from childhood friendship\u2014one that has that deep and beautiful strength of young love\u2014and (my favorite) one that starts out as merely raw, sexual attraction and slowly develops into something much more.Ivyanne is a character that\u2019s easily relatable. This book is unapologetic about Ivyanne\u2019s struggle to live up to her kingdom\u2019s expectations while dealing with the hormones and emotions any single woman in her 20\u2019s probably does. I love the honest vulnerability of her character, because while she makes mistakes, Ivyanne\u2019s not a flighty pushover either.I was aware before reading this adult mermaid book that many readers were fans of this series because of the sexy scenes and hunky heroes throughout. But truth be told, although those scenes will make your Kindle smoke, my favorite part of this book was the dialogue.Munt writes some spectacular and snappy dialogue. She really has a gift for it. This is a series that is going to take off. I can just feel it. So if you\u2019re an adult who enjoys a steamy romance, you should pick this one up. Add me to S.K. Munt\u2019s ever-growing list of avid fans."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5999683-suzanne", "userReview": "Ivyanne is a mermaid princess who has been sheltered her whole life. As the princess, it is her duty to marry a merman who is worthy enough to be king as well as help her create the purest offspring possible. She had been previously promised to two others who died so she thinks she has been cursed. Three men have stepped forward as suitors but she just needs some time to herself to contemplate her choices since she has resigned herself to marrying for duty rather than love. The three men are from marked families, Ardhi, her best friend, and Tristan and Bane who she knows very little about. She chooses a resort where she spent many summers not expecting to come face to face with Lincoln, her childhood human love. So instead of a quiet time to gather her thoughts, Ivyanne has to contend with two out of the three suitors vying for her attention plus Lincoln who has always held her heart but cannot be her future.I'm really glad I read Urchin first so I understood the mermaid history and family hierarchy. This was a great progression of the mermaid story that I thoroughly enjoyed, fell in love with Tristan, and was surprised with some great action and twists I didn\u2019t see coming.

I was very pleasantly surprised.Ivyanne is a mer-princess who was incredibly sheltered all of her life. As the princess and one of the few full blood mermaids, it is her duty to marry a merman who is worthy enough to be king as well as help her create the purest offspring possible. Three men have stepped forward, her best friend, a pain in the ass, and a rather neutral party. Having had two previous engagements ending in disaster, Ivyanne is understandable resistant to choose and spends some time on the main land to collect her thoughts and come to a decision. Enter, Lincoln, her childhood human love and, instead of a quiet time of reflection, Ivyanne gets to contend with two out of the three suitors vying for her attention and the guilt of keeping her secret from the man she truly loves.I really enjoyed the world that the author created. It was complex, detailed and enthralling. The mermaids were very well thought out and descriptions of their transformations and little tricks to fool the humans were imaginative and usually believable. I also enjoyed that the author did not shy away from a mermaids natural instincts to be selfish and tunnel visioned. They're not just mermaids but sirens and can be flawed and dangerous. We see this come out quite a few times in the main character and it makes her all the more believable. The one difficulty I had with the the author's world was that the history of the mer-people is so detailed and complex that I had a hard time keeping up with who was who. I still don't think I quite understand the lineages and who is special to whom and why. I think it would have been nice to have almost a family tree worked into the book so that when I was having trouble remembering who a character was and why he/she was important, I could refer back to the tree and understand a little better. It took me at least halfway through the book if not more to be able to sort out all the different characters and histories.In \"The Marked Ones\" no one is really as they seem. Ivyanne is portrayed as a \"good girl\". She's virginal and sheltered but knows her own mind and doesn't shy away from her sexuality as one would expect from a virgin, which is refreshing. Must be the siren in her. Tristan and Ardhi, the two lead suitors, will definitely surprise you and not necessarily for the good. I was really surprised by one of the plot twists at the end. I think out of everyone, Lincoln, Ivyanne's human love, was my least favourite character. He came across whiny and a little too vulnerable for me. I found myself rooting more and more for one of the mer suitors, not only because of her duty to her people, but because the human was such a pansy.Finally, the author's writing style was easy to read but not boring. Many times, it can be difficult to blend literary interest with actual story telling without being either too flowery or too bland. \"The Marked Ones\" was definitely a quick read for me. The story picked up pretty much from the very beginning and did not lack a variety of language and style.I'm really looking forward to the next book.

She's being pressured to marry to carry on the royal line. Feeling trapped, she runs off to the seaside resort of her youth to think things over. Should she marry the hottest merman alive, her closest friend or someone who seems to show no interest in her? They've all put their proposals in but she loves none of them. To complicate matters more the love of her life, Lincoln, is now the owner of the resort. The problem? He's human and off limits to Ivyanne. She's only allowed to marry a Marked One and Lincoln is not one of them. She must choose between the best man for her people or the best man for her heart.This story grasped me from the start. I have yet to read a Mer story and Munt's plot is intricate and well thought out. Fantastic story of creation and history of the Mer people.Munt has a way of making \u201cto-die-for\u201d men. Tristan is one of these. At first, you just want to kick him where it counts but halfway through you're wishing he'd come crashing through your bedroom door. I'm not a huge fan of love triangles, though, so that part for me was a little trying but it was also the antagonist in the story so I got through it.This is the 3rd book by Munt that I've read and I'm currently reading a 4th. She has written about so many different paranormal beings, I believe she can write a book about paint drying at this point and I'll still read it.

It was a well thought out and imaginative take on mermaids, their hierarchy, origins and lives. I have always been fascinated by mermaids so I had a lot of expectations of this book, and S.K. Munt didn't disappoint! There were a few typos but it didn't detract from the enjoyment I got out of reading this.We are introduced to the mermaid Princess, Ivyanne and she is a 28 year old mermaid, although she only looks to be about 16-18. That would be fantastic lol. She has come to the point in her life when it is time for her to chose her husband and future king. Her prospects are not what she wants them to be and she is expected to chose from a Marked son, a Mer that is pure blood with royal lineage. She is overwhelmed by the gravity of the decision she must make so she decides to spend some time on dry land among the humans to have some life experiences on her own. Things quickly turn harder than she could ever have imagined when she starts her new job and it all escalates from there. I'm not gonna tell you so that you'll read it for yourself!

This story has everything you could possibly want in a book. Love, hate, betrayel, action and much more. The twists in the story were great....didn't see them coming. The characters were compelling and believable.

And let me tell you, that was so much easier to read than the story with guys fighting over the normal girl who doesn\u2019t even think she\u2019s pretty. I had no trouble buying that there would be 3 dudes ready to destroy each other for the hand of the smokin\u2019 hot mermaid princess. And maybe this is a sign that I am outgrowing the YA level, but I thought it was great that marriage was on the line and not just a date to prom or whatever. Another thing that I liked/found super frustrating is that there isn\u2019t an obvious choice for husband. I definitely have a favorite, but I can\u2019t tell if he is going to win or not.

This failed to deliver. While it had one or two steamy moments, and a whole lot of promise - it was a poor story that kept getting worse and worse as it went along. It failed as a romance, because there was no chemistry between the main characters, it failed as human interest, failed as a new take on an old story, failed as an action, failed miserably overall. What a shame. Spare yourself and do not read this."}, {"userName": "Vicky Bix", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21856345-vicky-bix", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this book...the characters are so full of sassyness and sexyness..once the characters had me in their grasp I could not put it down..my life was consumed by ivyanne and the men in her life...was up till 3am just reading to find out what would happen next...the author has done an amazing job in bringing her characters to life..so much so that u wished you had a Tristen or a Link in your life.."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18296356-emma", "userReview": "This book is not what I usually read, When I read about it I thought oh mermaids and thought of Disney and singing lobsters! Which didn't bode well. ( Although there was singing.) If anyone doesn't like love triangles you'll want to read this there are five in the mix! and found myself shouting go for Tristan it's a no-brainer! All in all it was a great book and I will be reading the series."}, {"userName": "Tezz", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22914652-tezz", "userReview": "Omg This book had me captivated from the start!
