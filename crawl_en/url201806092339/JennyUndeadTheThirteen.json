Jenny Undead came recommended by Tim Marquitz, a great author whose opinion I trust, and let me tell you, I have a lot to thank him for. Jenny Undead is perfect for zombie fans, and especially for fans of Rhiannon Frater. Jenny lives in a brutal, unforgiving, zombie-filled world, and her own family is to blame. Both her mother and her grandfather were scientists who experimented on Jenny, her brother Casey and several other kids. Jenny escaped her family years ago, but every day, she regrets leaving Casey behind. In her desperate attempt to find and save her brother, Jenny falls straight into a trap and her life (and afterlife) get changed forever. Jenny is a heroine you\u2019ll have no trouble following into one bloody battle after another. She is strong and charismatic, a natural born leader, yet she also has a softer, more vulnerable side, one that is scared to hope for a better life. After surviving a horrendous childhood and just marginally better adulthood, Jenny is a woman with strong principles and a very kind heart. Ah, but let\u2019s not forget the romance! When we meet Jenny, she\u2019s already in a long, loving relationship with Declan Munro, a strong man with a reputation for being vicious and merciless. The depth of emotions these two share is astonishing and heartwarming. Jenny is the only thing that matters to Declan, and their relationship is the pillar that makes this book much stronger. Finding a book with an already established romance is a rare treat, and Jenny and Declan proved that authors should definitely do this more often. To people who are understandably cautious when picking up an indie book, I\u2019ll say only this: Jenny Undead is perfectly written, perfectly edited and perfectly formatted. I\u2019ve seen traditionally published books in far worse shape. Don\u2019t hesitate to pick this one up, I promise you won\u2019t regret it for a second."}, {"userName": "Su Williams", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11918776-su-williams", "userReview": "Aaaaaaahhhh! Ok got that out of my system. I love love loved this book. It is truly brilliant. JL Murray does an enticing, brilliant job with a suspenseful story line. So well written, I had a hard time finding anything to criticize. I'm fairly new the the zom genre and Jenny Undead ranks right up there with Rot & Ruin by Jonathan Maberry. I love the lighter cover edition. It's more eye catching. Two thumbs way up for Jenny Undead!!!"}, {"userName": "Netanella", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1157679-netanella", "userReview": "4 1/2 stars for another spectacular piece of speculative fiction by author J.L. Murray. The author does an incredible job with her worldbuilding here - the book is set about a decade or so after a scientific experiment gone horribly wrong. The world is populated with an assortment of the living and the undead, and apparently, a few thinking undead. Heathens, Thumpers, and the Righteous make up the living, some in underground cultish groups, others not so underground or cultish, but just as deadly. Jenny is alive when we meet her, in a deep and committed relationship with the dangerous Declan, and she hides the secret of her family - her sadistic grandfather and cruel mother were scientists who experimented on her and her brother, Casey, and let loose the zombie plague on the world. Jenny escaped their clutches, but left her brother behind. Now, she's on a hunt to find her brother and make her family pay.The story sucked me in, particularly with side cast of characters. The acerbic Trixie is a particular favorite. And like some of the better zombie movies, the author does a great job in making you care about the characters, and then like a heartless bitch, she kills them off. Don't get too comfortable here. One of the things that really held this book together was the relationship between Declan and Jenny, and their need for one another. I cannot wait to see how book two turns out."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5089871-pam", "userReview": "Jenny is living in a world of rotters. She is trying to stay alive and find her brother. She ran away years ago and now wants to find him and hopes he is safe. She is tough but she is also scared someone will find out her secret. Her mother is rumored to be the reason for the zombies and she did experiments on children looking for a way to stop the zombie apocalypse. Jenny and her brother Casey were some of the children she experimented on. Jenny also had to deal with more horror than the rest. She puts herself in danger to find her brother and when she does she is in for a surprise. Casey has been bit and died but he isn't like the other zombies. He has kept his mind and is just like people still alive. Jenny gets bit and finds she is the same way. There is thirteen of them that were experimented on and now may be the key to saving the world. Jenny is different than the others and everyone seems to be after her. She is the key to fixing it all. She won't take threats lying down and goes after those who harm her loved ones.I really enjoyed this book. I have read a few zombie books were they kept their mind but Jenny is a great character. She rushes into things and even when she gets turned and hungry she does everything she can to keep from hurting others. She is in love but would rather he stay away than risk her harming him. She is being told all kinds of things and doesn't know who to trust. Declan loves Jenny and seems to be the guy most are afraid of. He isn't afraid to kill and usually kills any zombie he sees. I will say I worried he would kill Jenny when he saw her. He does go a little crazy but only because he loves her. He is a great guy no matter what others think as he wants to stay near Jenny even when she is changed. There is so much going on in this book. Like you would think there is always danger or something happening and now they have to deal with people wanting them and government secrets. I loved every bit of this book and yes even the sad parts. They show you Jenny's softer side. I will be looking for the next book as I have to see what happens next. If you enjoy books with zombies be sure to pick this one up."}, {"userName": "Lady", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21881063-lady", "userReview": "This series must be read in order. This is the first book.Jenny isnt like other girls. She had the worst childhood as a lab rat until she ran away leaving her brother behind. Everything she has done has been to find him again. She has an awesome boyfriend and an amazing crew that have helped her make a real life for herself even in this post apocalyptic hell of a world over run by rotters but nothing means anything if she doesn't find the little brother she abandoned to her mad scientist mother in that long ago lab. Maybe that's why she listens to Sully even though she knows there is something off about him... No one knows her past or her life as a lab rat and they would probably kill her if they did but being the daughter of the mother of the plague just means she is more determined to reconnect with the one family member she still has living!This book was an amazing post apocalyptic action adventure scifi gem that screams girl power. I really enjoyed all the diverse characters and the convoluted mysteries that led to loads of suspense and amazing thrills. You never truly know who to trust or what will happen next.

Tough and vulnerable at the same time, nothing is going to stand in Jenny's way as she seeks answers to the world-ending problems that are her family legacy--and if she's lucky, she just may be able to find the cure.Great introduction to this new series.

To try and put into words what I thought of this book.Our Jenny. I, like Declan, grew to love her quickly. In a world - literally - gone to pieces, Jenny manages to keep moving forward and staying strong. She was one to admire, or for some, be too jealous of. She didn't need fancy clothes or make up, she is enchanting even covered in dead zombie. That's class.Declan, in his own right, is the star of the show as well. He's the baddest of the bad asses in a world gone wrong, with only one weakness, her. He doesn't give a **** about nothin' but her. It's so touching yet heartbreaking. There was only one person the world that he'd give anything to, Jenny. Of course he is not going to want to let her go. I don't think I've ever been brought to tears by a scene about crackers...but I won't forget the one between Deck and her. I said it before, and I'll say it again, he is the last true romantic.This is a dark, sometimes quite disturbing, intense read. It will take you places you are not sure you are comfortable going on so many levels, but if you survive it, it will take you through them to the other side. I am a fan of this author's other works - love the Niki Slobodian series so much. This first installment of her new trilogy, I daresay is just as good as her Niki series. And that says a lot. Just really my cup of tea. I mean, who doesn't love a book with a good knife fight with a zombie and a good dash of heartache mixed in?"}, {"userName": "Gwen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8176523-gwen", "userReview": "** Review for book 1 and 2 ***I decided to read this book in the spirit of Halloween, keeping in mind that I don't celebrate or know what it means but what the heck. I have to admit that I have a soft spot for zombie books (and no the Doctor says I don't need to worry about it) and this one was just the ticket.Jenny seems to have no luck in love, life or family as everything goes from bad to worse in a post apocalyptic world where her friends seem to die as fast as her enemies mount up. It was a fast action packed world with lots of blood and gore and of course zombies, I am just amazed that Jenny keeps going. Without giving away the storyline Jenny seems to hold the cure for the plague but has to pay an incredibly high price for it. The 2nd book which i had to run out and buy is a continuation of this hair raising journey with more loss and heartache and was for me was just as great a read - but one weakness and therefore loss in rating was the repetitive nature of all the torture jenny had been through, it felt like every second person had to be told, but I didn't let this get me down and we wait in anticipation for the third installment.Highly recommended !!"}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5807659-jenna", "userReview": "3.5 stars Jenny has been looking for her brother Casey for a long time.

Never been much of a zombie book fan, as much as I like zombie flicks, I always found them more suited to a visual medium since the don't talk or have personalities. Most zombie novels are the same, dead people get the munchies, bite people, civilization goes to hell, blah blah blah. This one starts with that premise, then takes off in a different direction What if something happened to wear some of them retained their human personalities but had the urges the hungry and undead?

Fans of Rhiannon Frater's \"As the World Dies\" series will likely enjoy this one. I certainly did! Jenny Undead follows MC Jenny in a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested world. What's different about this book compared to other zombie stories is Jenny's connection to the origin of the zombie virus. Pretty interesting stuff.The pacing is fast, the writing is well done, and there are a few twists.

So, yay! Zombie protagonist.The bad...The world building is thinner than the crust one of those super-cheap, frozen, supermarket cheese pizzas. The kind of pie where the box probably tastes better than the alleged food it contains. And probably has more nutrients.There's a weird feeling of dissonance with the setting. Where, on one hand, it feels like the world's been in a state of pocky-clypse for a long time, decades perhaps. Society is in shambles, but a rough sort of order has been established, more stability than you'd expect if the society had come undone a few years ago. But as the story progress, it turns out that that's exactly the situation. The zombie apocalypse happened five or six years ago.Thematically, the story is equally lacking. It's an action-packed romp, but readers looking for the depth of Hunger Games or \nRed Rising\n should look elsewhere. The story is simple, and fun, but not emotionally challenging."}, {"userName": "Merredith", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1583037-merredith", "userReview": "Another zombie book? Well, kind of! This is the first in a series and the main character becomes a zombie pretty early on, yet still retains her consciousness and thoughts. It's more like when people turn into vampires or werewolves and just have to control their appetites. Jenny finds that she is supposed to be the Cure, the one person who can stop the epidemic of the normal zombies and fix the world. I loved how the premise had a twist from normal zombie stories, but for much of the book, it was kind of dull. It wasn't until near the end that I started caring about the characters and got into the story. Basically, I liked it just in time for me to decide to want to read book #2 - which isn't out yet.

In a world ravaged by disease and chaos, Jenny has a secret. She and her brother were part of a gruesome experiment conducted ten years earlier in an attempt to stop the zombie apocalypse. If the rumors are true, her mother was the hated pathologist who released the disease in the first place, leading to the destruction of government, civilization, and life as we know it.Despite the constant terror of the undead, Jenny is as happy as a post-apocalyptic girl can be. She has friends, she's good with a knife, and she has Declan Munro by her side. But when she hears her brother might still be alive and living with the Underground, a religious group hiding in the now-defunct subway, Jenny jumps at the chance to find him. She infiltrates the group to right the wrong she caused when she ran away, leaving him in that lab.When she finds him, though, Casey is not at all what she expected. He's been turned. And the impossible happens when Jenny is bitten. She and Casey are dead, but they're not like any other rotters. Their minds are still intact. And there are others: Thirteen children survived the mysterious experiments, and it\u2019s up to Jenny to find them and bring an end to the plague. But not everyone wants the chaos to end. Between battling her hunger for living flesh and the all-encompassing rage that goes with it, and the realization that a killer is stalking both the living and the undead, Jenny has her hands full. Coming between a dead girl and the people she loves is a big mistake. Because if you can count on one thing, it's this: You wouldn't like her angry.", "title": "Jenny Undead\n      \n          (The Thirteen #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18107882-jenny-undead", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1371824359l/18107882.jpg", "reviews": 25, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5618396.J_L_Murray", "name": "J.L.
