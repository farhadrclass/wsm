After finishing Frater's first book, The First Days, I quickly ordered the sequel from the library, planning to save it for a slow and deadly boring night of the living dead shift. Unfortunately, I was placed 'on-call,' which meant while I didn't have to work that moment, it was quite possible in the next eight hours I would be needed for brains to work. I celebrated my night almost-off by staying up afraid of zombies to read \"Fighting,\" taking another hour to ratchet down from zombie-caused tension and ended up being up until 4 a.m. anyway, accomplishing the goal of reading and wakefulness--however unnecessary. Briefest of summaries: survivors are walled off in a town center post-zombie apocalypse. Survivors are trickling in, putting pressure on space and resources. The goal becomes expanding into a store block for resources, and a nearby hotel to provide living space. Relationships continue to grow among the central characters, and individuals continue to deal with emotional fallout after having their loved ones turned into zombies. As the camp is taking a breather, internal malcontents trouble the group's unformed justice system, followed by problems from external marauders. A bundle of improvements since the last book made it more compelling than the last. Similarly to the first book, the plot moves briskly along, making this a quick and engaging read. There are plenty of zombies, all the better to eat you entertain. you. As far as writing style, there was more sophistication in word choice, making for a better reading experience. However, there is still a tendency to describe repetitively people in single notes, which seems more of an author issue with characterization. Jenni, one of our heroines, is the loca  one, Nerit is the icy sharpshooter, Curtis the red-faced inexperienced cop, etc. I get that a large group of people new to each other might tend to repetitively generalize, but eventually it's too easy for the author and the shortcuts make for shallow graves characters that are defined by one or two traits. Speaking of characterization, my hackles rose a little when it was pointed out the bisexual character was finally in \"comfortable shoes and casual t-shirts.\" Because, isn't that where all lesbians bisexuals (yes, we are still making an issue of her sexuality in this book) prefer to be? And why did the heavyset young black female come with stereotypical gay-boi sidekick with equally stereotypical dialogue? The rich people were right out \"Rich Snob Here\" character casting, and it is only a matter of time before the trophy wife becomes zombie bait. Honestly, Frater, you aren't being inclusive in the post-apocalypse community if the only thing you are including are stereotypes.Still, the zombie bits are done well, and the (as always) living human meat-heads in and outside the fort are providing much of the threat. The scenes clearing the hotel were hair-raising and contained the full shiver-inducing complement of horror movie tropes. I devoured read that section very quickly! I also give Frater full credit for a creative set-up for her survival situation. The downtown construction site is creative and seems possible, with the materials enabling survivors to build sturdy zombie-barriers. However again, the brief appearance of the internet was a bit much. CB radio is slightly more believable, as the tech and electricity is so much lower.I can't seem to help it; despite the aforementioned glaring problems, it was an addictive read, and I've got the next book on hold at the library. I guess that tells you all you need to know about the book, or about my addiction. I wonder if there's an opening in Z.F.A.?

They're scary aren't they? They eat your flesh, they don't feel pain, and they never EVER stop. But what about humans? Humans who are dead set on surviving? Humans who have a screwed up sense of humanity in this dying world? And these humans, they may not eat your face, or pound themselves on a wall for days on end to get a taste of you, but they have intelligence, they have strength\u2026 and they have weapons. Zombies are NOT the only enemy anymore! I'm not even sure which I fear the most.Fighting to Survive continues the story of our exceptional heroines Katie and Jenni. They're surviving at the fort, making a new life for themselves behind the safety of the walls. As in The First Days, Fighting to Survive gives us incredible character development. We get acquainted with a lot of the survivors; even if only briefly, these people could not be any more real. I know them, with all my heart I love them, and this makes everything especially terrifying. It's a zombocalypse, people die, and it matters! Even when it's the less important characters who we barely know - It matters! In this sequel we really get to see the day to day events of what it takes to survive and build a new community after disaster strikes. There are all kinds of people with different views, different opinions; It's a whole planet in a nutshell. But don't get too comfortable!It's not all peace and quiet - that's not really Rhiannon's style now, is it? (how boring would that be!) - zombies are aplenty, in addition, we still have a vigilante to find, as well as new bandits to deal with. Tension is, again, high from start to finish. Even during the peaceful times, the underlying mood is constantly ominous with a always present gut feeling that a storm is brewing. I LOVE it! A mastermind in suspense, Rhiannon knows how to build excruciating anticipation where you just want to read until your eyes bleed. It's such an extraordinary adrenaline rush I had to stop mid-ending to scream at her, let it out a little. The ending: foreboding, exciting, terrifying. Siege, the third and final book in this epic series, will undoubtedly be a thing of legend!If you haven't started this series yet, you have no idea what you're missing. It's the most amazing story about survival that I have ever read, with scenes so haunting, characters so vivid, that I will be hearing their words and remembering their fears for a very long time.--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at \nXpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Stacia (the 2010 club)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013351-stacia-the-2010-club", "userReview": "Juan flicked the brim of his cowboy hat up. \"Never a dull moment.\"\"I miss dull moments,\" Travis mused.\n\n3.5 stars. Surviving the zombie apocalypse has never interested me more than it does right now. The As The World Dies trilogy is the perfect thing to fill in the gap for me until The Walking Dead comes back on television.Three cheers for books which give me a variety of things to read about :~ Violence, gore and all-around ass-kicking.~ People battling their inner demons.~ Conflict within the ranks, leading up to a call for the overthrowing of political power.~ The fight for survival, even down to the day-to-day mundane details not involving zombies. That food ain't gonna come from thin air, after all.~ Friendships and romantic relationships budding even in the face of adversity.Half a point deduction for a few small details :~ The dream sequences bordered on cheesy. It's awkward to read about dead relatives coming back in a person's dreams just in order to tell them to move on. ~ I felt like a few of the scenes repeated themselves, except for in different locations.~ The emphasis on how much hate was thrown at Katie should have wrapped up sooner, or at the very least come to a head after the big \"situation in the bathroom\" scene happened. I felt like that part of the story dragged on for far too long, especially when the biggest conflict in the book should have (imo) revolved around the fight to stay alive.~There were no zombie kitties.Let's face it : a little action and adventure never hurt a book.After just coming out of a read where not much was happening other than a relationship conflict, it was fun to sink back into something where I got to go along on the cast of characters' adventures. Finally...I really do love the sense of community in these books.Everyone works together to ensure survival. Old families are gone. New families are held together by something other than blood ties. In a sense, the new families are stronger because of the need to lean on one another.\n\nIn a world full of death, life was something to embrace."}, {"userName": "Chloe", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe", "userReview": "Know how to beat a crippling addiction to zombie books? Find the most poorly written series available and read until your eyes bleed. I think that this book has finally shaken the last vestiges of my zombie love from me. The scenes with actual zombies are mildly entertaining, but the endless (ENDLESS!) pages of characters shacking up with one another, thinking about shacking up with one another, or agonizing about having shacked up with someone had me wanting to pull my eyes out and flush them away so that I could not read another word. The female duo from the first book are significantly weakened and watered down here as Jeni falls head over heels for her one-time nemesis Juan and Katie remembers that \"oh yeah!\" before she was married to the wife of her dreams (who had then became the zombie of her nightmares), she had liked men too! What a coincidence that there is a kind and gentle giant ruling with a velvet glove over these survivors. How perfectly convenient. It bugged me. I understand Frater's often repeated points about how society expects people to fall on one side or the other of the gender binary and how it just isn't fair to force people to limit themselves to others' definitions of secuality, but I still hated it. Katie was a strong, self sufficient, lesbian trying to cope with some crippling PTSD after being chased by her zombified wife in the first book, but here she just grated on my nerves. And the rape. Please do not get me started on the rape scene. Ever. If you are at the bottom of the zombie literature barrel and absolutely must have one more, I would still recommend passing over these books."}, {"userName": "Bandit", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit", "userReview": "This book, well really this serial, is precisely the equivalent of a cheesy tv show or maybe some sort of a snack food. It has that certain quality of being just good enough without really providing any substance. Yet if it's there, it's just entertaining enough or serviceable enough to keep eating or not change the chanel, depending on which metaphor you went with there. The best word to describe it is adequate. Yes, there are strong female characters, but all of their emotions are overexplained to the point of extreme. Could Katie's bisexuality possibly be discussed any more? Can we empasize the fact the Jenni is so loca for being good at eliminating zombies during a zombie aplocalypse? Seriously, exactly how crazy is that? Could the majority of the characters be any more cookie cutter? Every emotion, every action is so simplified and spoonfed to the reader that eye rolling is probably the most prevalent reaction to this book. On a positive note, the action and pacing are quite decent, there are a few interesting characters, the ending is good and it's a quick read. So yeah, just ok, 2 stars."}, {"userName": "Legintis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5513009-legintis", "userReview": "This is a review of both book 1 and 2.I had a couple problems with these books, but overall I found them to be fairly enjoyable.SPOILERS AHEADFirst, Nerit needs her own book. Best character by far.One of my major issues was the constant descriptions of Jenni as \u201ccrazy.\u201d Yes, she was in an abusive relationship and was dealing with the psychological trauma of that as well as the trauma of the Zombie apocalypse, but I didn\u2019t really understand what she did to be described as crazy all the time. It became excessive to me, and then annoying. One of the major reasons people would call her crazy was because she took pleasure in killing zombies. No shit!!! They are eating people. (Actually, I\u2019m going to digress a bit here, but why the f**k does the \u201cShould we kill the zombies\u201d debate always come up in zombie fiction? If you are in the midst of the zombie apocalypse and you happen to find yourself involved in this conversation the answer is always YES!!! Why are we discussing this? Zombies eat people!! Kill them all. I would be killing zombies like it was my job. Ooooh Jenni likes killing the cannibalistic walking corpses\u2026what a crazy lady. Um no\u2026Jenni is the only one who gets it!! Kill them. Don\u2019t keep them in the barn, don\u2019t try to help them \u2013 just aim for the head.) The crazy label continues into the second book, and it really started to make me crazy.The strongest parts of the books are when there is some solid zombie action going on. I also really enjoyed the fight with the bandits. The books really stall when everyone is talking /thinking about their feelings or whatever. Especially in book number two. After they take the hotel things slow down quite a bit.I had a couple really minor issues with some of the smaller details of the book. At one point they return to a hunting supply store and load up on guns and ammo, but then later they are all worried about running out of ammo. Why didn\u2019t you take more?!?! Also, get practicing with those crossbows!! The survivors also seem to have an almost unlimited supply of food. I know they have scavenged and hunted and what not, but there\u2019s not going to be abandoned wal-mart trucks laying around all the time so I think some rationing would be a good idea. I also agree with people on the whole electricity issue. These characters don\u2019t even seem worried that the electricity might go out. Or that it might go out at a really bad time. Say, when they\u2019re in the elevator\u2026I really didn\u2019t like the love stories that emerged. I thought Frater had a great opportunity to have these two bad ass female leads and then of course they go getting all lovey dovey. The relationship between Travis and Katie really disappointed me. If you\u2019re going to make your lead a lesbian just go for it. The whole \u201cOh, I\u2019m actually bi\u2026\u201d thing felt like a cop-out to me. In fact, I felt as though both Katie and Jenni became a bit clich\u00e9. I was slightly confused by how Katie and Jenni related to each other. Maybe, it\u2019s just me, but I found the relationship a bit bizarre. Almost as though Frater didn\u2019t really know how two really hot, popular chicks would relate to each other. Honestly, at a couple points I wouldn\u2019t have been shocked if they just started having a pillow fight in their underwear.Finally, the book tends to be redundant. Take for example the \u201ctiny fingers\u201d description. That phrase gets brought up repeatedly. Oh my God!! I get it! The fingers were tiny!! There\u2019s also times (I\u2019m too lazy to look up the specifics) where a character\u2019s inner emotions will be described in a paragraph, and then 4 or 5 paragraphs later is the same description with a couple of different details. Although this review probably sounds negative I actually did enjoy this book. It\u2019s entertaining zombie fun. That\u2019s all I really wanted out of it. It\u2019s certainly not going to win a Pulitzer any time soon, but both these books are entertaining and I will read the third one.PS \u2013 Don\u2019t hang out with people named Shane if you\u2019re caught up in the Zombie Apocalypse. They seem to be bad news :D"}, {"userName": "Regina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104032-regina", "userReview": "Rhiannon Frater has amazing talent to take a topic that has been written about a lot and turn it into something new, fresh and different. Fighting to Survive is the second in the As the World series and it delivers gory, scary zombie goodness with great survival drama.Fighting to Survive continues to be told from the alternating point of views of both Katie and Jennie who were introduced in The First Days. The story takes off exactly where it left off at the end of First Days, the group of survivors is hiding behind an enforced wall and making plans to move into a nearby hotel. There is political and emotional drama as the group struggles to deal with the new zombie infested world, their losses and a different power structure in this post apocalyptic world. Sometimes stuff like this can be presented in a boring manner or an overly dramatic way -- Frater does neither. The story is rich and complex and like everyday human life, nothing is simple.Fighting to Survive is funny. Jenni is called La Loca and her personality adds a lot of humor to the gory and scary world,\"Moving determinedly toward the kitchen, Jenni caught a faint whiff of decay. \"Shit!\" Jenni screamed, \"Theyre' here!\" Abruptly, the door to the kitchen was flung open and the waitstaff flooded into the room, ready for the breakfast.\"Both Jenni and Katie suffered significant emotional losses in the first book and this fact is not glossed over. Both continue to be haunted by the pain. I really like how Frater makes her zombie books so real. Yes real in the the monsters are damned scary, gruesome and nonstop. But also, her characters are in emotional pain; they don't just rebound and move on. There are inner struggles and the characters act on these. In the first book, Jenni's children die -- how does a mother move past this? Can she? I was worried at first when I read the summary of this series that Ms. Frater wouldn't present a mother's pain realistically. Well, she does. Jenni is a complicated character to begin with and her losses only magnify this. But the twisted thing about Jenni, is that because of the way her life was prior to the zombie rising (she was an abused wife) and despite her horrific losses, her life now is freer than it ever was. Jenni recognizes the twistedness of this and she suffers for it.Human beings can be ugly -- not just in the morning before a shower, but I mean dark souls and mean people who take advantage of the weak. And what better time for people like this to come to the surface than a zombie apocalypse? Dealing with the zombies in As the World Dies is pretty straightforward -- don't get bit, kill them and eliminate them. The human beings who want power and like to hurt people are less straight forward and this is where Fighting to Survive becomes really interesting. It is pure survival at its basic level -- food, shelter, fighting monsters and fighting human beings who want to assert their evil control.Fighting to Survive is not all humor and drama though, it is filled with excellent gore and fight scenes,\"With a grunt, Katie shoved the zombie over with her foot. It landed hard on the steps, its head flopping to one side, its teeth still gnashing. LIfting the knife, Katie narrowed her eyes, aimed, and struck the zombie through the eyes as hard as she could. The knife hit bone and she twisted, pushing the blade further in. The jaws stilled. Katie braced her foot on the head and drew out her weapon. Cleaning it on the dead maid's dress, she looked up to see Roger and Travis watching her with stunned expressions. \"What?\" \"Damn,\" Roger said. \"You were like Alice in Resident Evil. That was hot.\"\"So, I read both the self-published version and the Tor version. Are there differences? Yes, in a subtle why the Tor version is smoother and tighter. The same substantive story is there, but I enjoyed the Tor version even more. This is a series that I inhaled and read within a week but then still went on to buy all of the Tor versions and read those as well. If you like zombie and survivalist themed books, I think you will love this series.To read this and other reviews check out: www.badassbookreviews.com"}, {"userName": "Shanon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1795513-shanon", "userReview": "I learned a valuable lesson while reading this book. My habit of reading right before bed has never been too much of an issue but with Fighting to Survive (as well as As The World Dies) it made it impossible to get any sleep. I could not put the books down, believe me I tried! Once I started reading I did not feel tired at all so I simply kept reading all through the night. I enjoyed reading more about Katie & Jenni and all the other characters from the first book that I came to like. I also liked the introduction/exploration of new characters. The character development of both old and new characters is probably one of the things I like most about this series.

I want everyone to know that I am the last person on earth that would have ever believed I'd like a book like this. Imagine my shock when I not only liked it- but LOVED it! Rhiannon Frater has a true gift people- I'm so serious! I plan on reading more \"zombie\" books in the future but I don't have a huge hope that any will compare to this. I don't even see it as possible. Don't think that because I don't know my way around zombie-lit that I was in awe of the first thing I read either- I know my way around literature in general so that's a moot point. Somehow, someway, Frater was able to make this so damn realistic that is was downright frightening for me. Not only the blood shed and attacks and that sort of thing, I mean the feelings involved. I had such a wide range of emotions show themselves while reading this that when I think back it's still shocking. What to say about the characters? Have you ever read a book where each and every single character played a role? A good role? A role that is pertinent to the story? A book where you couldn't imagine it being a story still without this one character? Even if the character was off to the side for the entire story? Well, that's this. There are NO, I repeat- NO, frivolous characters in this story. They, each and every single one, bring something to the table. I wouldn't want any of them changed in the slightest, they were as close to being perfect characters as one can come I think. Whether they were \"good\", \"bad\", or just \"there\"- they each had a unique part in the book that just wouldn't have been the same without them. My favorite characters in this one? Hmmmm, it's hard to say but definitely Travis and Juan. Peggy is pretty cool too- of course Katie and Jenni. Nerit is just plain awesome. I'm freaked when I think of how on the edge of my seat I was. Half of me wanted the story to go as fast as possible so I could know what happened and the other half just wanted time to stand still so I could hold on to each situation and event. I could go on and on but I won't- I won't even give a quick run down of the book- read the description. Better yet- read the book.

A new beginning. And that was all any of them could hope for anymore. \nFighting to Survive starts up right after the first book in the As the World Dies Trilogy. The first chapter, each section is dedicated to getting us up to date with whats happening with our favorite survivors. This is another non-stop zombie thrilling kill ride... our ever growing rag-tag group of survivors has a vigilantes and bandits are on the way. Not to mention hords of zombies are showing up daily. Fighting to Survive deals with how these issues should be resolved and who's going to make this decision. The Government is gone and it's just them in the Fort trying to survive day to day. Our group has been lucky so far, they have water and electricity. In this second book, Fighting to Survive there are hair raising moments that you fear you'll lose those characters close to your heart but there are also, laugh out load funny moments. This perfect balance between the fearful reality and the little sweet moments that life is still dealing out is what makes this series so realistic and engaging.Jenni and Juan\nJenni thought it was good to have diversity. Jenni\u2019s contribution was as the crazy zombie killer, and she was fine with that. She crunched another chip. \nOh, I know that others have said she's uncaring for moving past (so you think :) her children's deaths but I connect with Jenni. I feel for her and in a way I admire the women she is now and how she was able to move past her abusive past. Like many member of the Fort, Jenni is riddled with nightmares of Lloyd and her children coming after her. To me, this is where Jenni is working out her guilt for surviving and not being able to save her children or end their lives once they were turned. She is also haunted by the women she once was, controlled by Lloyd and his abuse, because the Jenni of the new world does not sit down or go away quietly. She's just as loca as Juan believes and it's so fun to read.\nIn Jenni\u2019s waking moments, she was loving, outgoing, and funny. But in her dreams, she was afraid and emotionally shattered. It broke his heart. \nJuan, he's a fine, sweet hearted, strong and lovable Mexican-American (or Texan). His fortification and constant surveillance of the Fort has saved countless lives. He's always there to protect those who cannot protect themselves and believes that Jenni is the best thing to come his way, ever. He's an amazing friend to Travis but he's also quick to temper and anger. His relationship with Jenni is so sweet you can feel your teeth ache. They are mad for each other and don't waste one moment fighting or not sharing in this bliss that they found. It's beyond fun to read and I love that Jenni found that, she needed it and in the end it's Juan and his endless love and commitment to her that will chase away the nightmare.Katie and Travis\n\u201cI look at you and I want to save the world. I can\u2019t help it\u201d \u201cAre you sweet-talking me again?\u201d she lightly kidded. \nHere is your warning... If you haven't read this book, then don't read any further **Spoiler**\n\u201cI\u2019m madly in love with him. His body, his \u2026 smell \u2026 the way he touches me \u2026 all so different from Lydia, but I love him. I kept wanting not to love him, but I do.\u201d\nKatie, how could you not love her. She never skirts her responsibilities and she stands up for what she believe and loves. Her wife was killed in the beginning of the zombie attack and her guilt and grief is palpable. She cannot move past her love and misses Lydia ever day. The problem is she has a deep attraction to Travis. From the moment they met, they both knew that they meant something to each other. Katie has been hiding her secret that she is Bisexual for too long and as we progress into Fighting to Survive it's almost hard to read how she avoids Travis because they shared several amazing earth shattering kisses. In my review ofThe First Days I was disappointed that, Rhiannon Frater took this confident, successful lesbian and turned her conveniently bisexual. To me it seemed like a cop-out and I was truly looking forward to Katie finding another loving relationship with a women in this new world. Yeah, well that didn't happen but I also got over it because the way that Travis and Katie are together. Travis is so gentle with her loss, he's unbelievable comforting and supportive to Katie's life before him. This carefully crafted relationship that Ms. Frater wrote stole the show for me. \nJenni lifted her eyebrows. \u201cSpill it!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Katie asked, then broke into a huge grin. Jenni tackled her. Like schoolgirls, they hugged each other and jumped around, laughing, until they collapsed into a heap on the bed. \u201cYou have FFG!\u201d \u201cDo not!\u201d \u201cUh-huh! Freshly fucked glow!\u201d Jenni howled with laugher, pointing at Katie\u2019s flushed countenance. \nFun, engaging and a wild ride for sure. This fast moving series has grabbed hold of me and wont let go. Lets see how long I hold out until reading Siege. I cannot wait to read the conclusion to this fun and frightening series.I cannot leave out all the funny moments that cut through the nail bitting ones... Mr. Calhoun and his wacked comments...\n\u201cWhen did the town take over a privately owned building? This is socialism or communism, I can\u2019t remember which.

This book is not focused on one particular plot point, as we are given some of the \"days of our lives\" treatment of what is going on with the survivors as a few things crop up as key elements to move the story along. The first is the survivor's goal to get the hotel next to the construction site under their control. This is good for a few chapters of mayhem as they do a floor by floor search for zombies stuck inside as they desperately try to wall in the outside of the hotel. The second is coping with the mysterious vigilante that has claimed another victim. The third is the bandits that are terrorizing other survivors in the area that those in the fort are trying to save. Overall, this book is more focused on character development than it is on action, though there is a good amount of it. But the author's primary objective here is to show us how these people, in particular our two main characters, Katie and Jenni, are coming to grips with the new world order. The story is entertaining and certainly well thought out and makes sense. The stresses and challenges a surviving community would face under these circumstances ring true in this tale. Some criticisms I have here are related to some of the extensive details given about the characters thoughts and frustrations. We are regularly reminded throughout the story of how much Katie loved her former spouse, Lydia, and how it is such a challenge for her to love Travis as well. We are reminded several more times about Jenni's ex-husband and children who were turned into the shambling undead and how she must cope with that while trying to build a new life for herself. I realize that some readers might feel it is crucial for us to truly understand what is going through these character's heads but I personally prefer a bit less rehash every time Katie and Travis get together about how much he wants to protect her and how much she wants to love him while coping with the ghost of Lydia haunting her dreams. Most of the characters are developed fairly solidly and plausibly but I wish the author had been perhaps less willing to fall into stereotyping a few of the more minor characters. It seemed as if she was doing this to save time so we as the readers immediately know what to expect. The wealthy couple in town are predictably snobs who have the audacity to demand a suite in the hotel, for the common folk to serve them, etc. Calhoun, the town crazy, seems like the typical nutjob with a tinfoil hat on his head, ranting on about clones, amazons, and other flights of fancy. I've seen this type before, many times. Finally, the evil characters, like Shane and the bandits, are painfully and obviously evil with a lack of much in the way of common sense or intelligence. I do realize that this, the second book, is leading up to what is quite likely a far more disturbing and hopefully intelligent nemesis for the population of the fort for book 3 (as hinted at in the epilogue) so perhaps the author is working her way up to something more intriguing than the scumbags they had to deal with here. Criticisms aside, I liked this book. Please don't get the impression that I think that the author did anything but a terrific job in crafting the overall storyline she has come up with. We are still dealing with strong, tough women (besides our main characters Nerit stands out as a prime example) and equally capable males in these books. The author has done a good job of building a saga that will hopefully come to a rousing conclusion in the third book."}, {"userName": "Andi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369069-andi", "userReview": "This was another page-turner! I really enjoyed reading about the characters' continuing struggles to survive. And the hotel-clearing scene was absolutely nail-biting! I'm also glad that tough decisions--the right ones--were made when necessary. I absolutely love Nerit, and was happy that she played such a big role in this book. Jenni and Katie occasionally drove me crazy, as with the first book. The mystery of the vigilante continues in this book and the person is not yet revealed, but some clues are provided. There is one minor nit that I cannot get past, though...they still have power and Internet service. This was explained by a brief mention of a new power station, but it was still highly unbelievable. I mean, you need people to continue maintaining the station, and I highly doubt there are folks at that power station keeping the lights on.Despite this, I can't wait to read the final book to see how everything turns out!"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483840-mike", "userReview": "In a genre dominated by male writer.

It's the second instalment of the 'As the World Dies' trilogy by horror writer, Rhiannon Frater. I loved the first book, 'The First Days' but this was even better. It was just so good I couldn't bear to put it down. I read it in two sittings and the story remained with me long after I finished the last page. The action came thick and fast and didn\u2019t let go, but was so wonderfully paced I didn\u2019t feel as though I was constantly trying to keep up.The characterisation is just amazing, I love Katie and Jenni; they are such great protagonists and all the secondary characters are just as well rounded and all have a part to play in this zombie horror. It\u2019s these characters that make this particular horror novel touching, moving, as well as it being gruesome, suspenseful and horrifying.There are multiple plots in \"Fighting to Survive\" but Frater manages to keep everything straight and not allow it all to become a jumbled mess. If fact, I really felt as though I was following Jenni and Katie's lives in almost real time and as each obstacle was presented to them I found myself trying to work out how to fix it with them. It gave the book authenticity, which I loved.The relationships between some of the characters are deepened. There's also lots of drama, emotional turmoil, for me as well as the characters, and lots of fantastic action. The scenes where the characters enter the hotel to clear it of zombies is honestly one of the most tense scenes I've read. My stomach was in knots for the entire time I was reading it. I was so worried about the characters and Frater does a superb job at keeping the suspense nice and tight and not let it drift, which made the whole thing nerve-racking.Jenni slips from reality a little further and sees the ghost of her husband, who was actually zombified in the first book. She's losing it but tries to keep it together. Jenni and Katie's friendship is stronger than ever. They are still the main characters, but we do get to know a little more about the other characters especially Travis and Juan.Katie's sexual attack was pretty horrific, my heart went out to her, but it was warming to see her friends rally around and support her. It was interesting to see how the residents of the fort reacted to this, most were supportive of Katie, but a few sided with the attacker. This frustrated me no end, but I suppose it's the same as in real life. Luckily, the horrid little man got his comeuppance!With hordes of zombies moaning and shuffling outside the fort's perimeters, there's a lot more to think about than romance. However, there is an element of romance throughout the novel for Katie and Jenni, which was a continuation from 'The First Days'.VERDICT:\u201cFighting To Survive\u201d is a horror novel with heart. It\u2019s funny and endearing in places and sickening and gory in others, but always perfectly balanced between the two. This series is a fantastic addition to the zombie genre and I cannot wait to get my hands on a copy of \u2018Siege\u2019 the final book in this phenomenal trilogy."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "*Rating* 4.0*Genre* Dystopian/Zombies*Review*I absolutely loved Nerit the former Israeli army sniper who suffered a devastating loss in the First Days, Volume I of this series. She is seriously awesome with a weapon. Takes crap from nobody. Makes final calls and trains everyone to fight back and shoot straight. When others blink or have second thougths. She charges ahead and protects the fort from zombies and bandits.Katie and Travis's relationship is one that will most likely be talked about for awhile. \"How can someone who claims to be a lesbian, actually be bi-sexual and thus falls madly in love with Travis and then she ends up ****** at the end?\" ::sigh:: I'm not touching this. I don't think it's anyones business how a person chooses to live or not live their lives. I will say that Katie experiences something along the way that I did a little over 10 years ago, and I wanted to throw her attacker over the wall along with his buddy myself! I like the fact that Jenni and Kate are best of friends and consider themselves the Zombie Apocalypse's Thelma and Louise. Let's just hope they don't drive off a cliff in the end! Jenni's journey is a wild and bumpy one that I wouldn't want to wish on anyone. I can't imagine seeing my own children and abusive ex-husband trying to kill me in my nightmares and everyday activities. The one negative I had in this whole Jenni and Juan thing is the freaking word Loca 9,000 times throughout the book. I don't blame anyone for screaming, because I wanted to do it myself. We have been hit over the head with it since Juan and Jenni hooked up during the first novel. She's nuts. She's crazy. She's a badass zombie killer.Another interesting character, to me, is Katarina. I'm calling her the Nerit's clone because of her actions at the end of this book and the fact that she is so calm about the way she handles situations. She still is an awesome character and I hope we see more of her in the next round.The ending? So, uhm, anyone want to lend me the next book to read? I totally hate the fact that I am out of work, still, and my library doesn't have this book yet! Maybe come January 1, I can start ordering them thru the Interlibrary Loan system!One of the funniest moments is when Jenni says, \"God, I hope there's not zombie fish!\" I couldn't help it but laugh. It was the right thing to say after a tense moment where the bad guys did something truly horrific to innocent kids. Can you imagine, Zombie fish?"}, {"userName": "Book Twirps", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5225569-book-twirps", "userReview": "4.5 starsI dug into this one as soon as I finished book one, The First Days. I feel as if I\u2019ve been camping out at the fort with the survivors. That\u2019s how immersed I was in this book.In The First Days, there was a lot of running, shooting, zombie encounters and general craziness. What I liked about this installment is that it wasn\u2019t just more of the same. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there is still plenty of zombie insanity, but that\u2019s not the primary focus in this installment.While the survivors still aren\u2019t free of the zombie threat, they are safe(r) within the walls of the fort they\u2019ve built. As they continue to build out and make more room, they attempt to rescue survivors that they\u2019re in touch with via the CB radios (which leads to more heart-racing zombie battles). But there\u2019s an underlying problem in the fort. The tension of the situation weighs heavily on some of the survivors. People begin to act out, and you see alliances beginning to be formed. On top of that, the survivors within the walls of the fort have a new threat other than the zombies, and their internal deconstruction. There\u2019s a gang of bandits scouring the land outside of the fort and they\u2019re getting closer.I felt that Ms. Frater did an excellent job getting into the heads of these people. We really get to know the characters, which is both good and bad. Good because by the end of the book you feel as if you actually know them, but bad because you know some of them aren\u2019t going to make it to the end. I especially liked the internal conflict that started rising between the survivors. I felt like the decay (pardon the pun) of their safe haven was realistic, and I didn\u2019t doubt for a minute that it would actually happen under these circumstances. People can be greedy and self-serving, and when the world as we know it no longer exists, it\u2019s only natural that chaos will erupt.The tension in this book is plenty, both within and outside the walls of the fort. It is a wonderful continuation of this trilogy and will definitely leave you screaming for book three."}, {"userName": "R.L.

Though it's been out for awhile now, I only recently discovered it.World building is always my favorite part of novels. And Rhiannon Frater does not disappoint. Haunted survivors desperately try to carve out an oasis of safety in a world where both the dead and the living can be a threat. Reclaiming the hotel was incredibly tense. Every time I started to feel safe that feeling of security was instantly snatched away.Despite the length of this seemingly monotonous endeavor, I found myself tearing through the pages eager to reassure myself that my favorite characters would survive.As if the tension of reclaiming infected areas of the town weren't enough, tensions rose pretty much every place they could. Tensions among the survivors, tension with other groups of survivors and bandits, the desperate sprint to prepare for war with others, the suspense of the vigilante.I have my suspicions about the vigilante. I'm sure by now most people do. I really can't wait to figure out who it is. I haven't yet decided if I applaud what they are doing or if I'm against their actions. In a world where every day is a struggle for survival, criminals can no longer be put in jail. Every person who is a drain on society is a risk to the others. But I suspect the vigilante will start to spiral out of control in book 3.There were two points that lowered this book from a 5 to 4 star. Firstly, the romance and sex. I think it was a little overdone. I didn't feel like any of it contributed to the story in any way and, at points, I feel like it broke the flow. But it's just not my thing. The scenes were still well written and pretty brief when they occurred so it wasn't a huge problem. Secondly, the ending. Or at least, a certain thing that was announced at the ending. I won't say what to avoid spoilers but I am extremely apprehensive about what it will mean for book three.That set-aside, I'm off to read the next one!"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1951344-michelle", "userReview": "Fighting To Survive is the second book in the As The World Dies series by Rhiannon Frater from TOR.Book Blurb:The hundred or so survivors in the fortified heart of Ashley Oaks are running out of food and room.The newly renovated historic hotel seems a perfect sanctuary - if it can be emptied of zombies.As search-and-rescue teams bring food, supplies - and more survivors - back to town, they draw unwanted attention.Bandits.My thoughts:Katie and Jenni and the survivors within the fort have settled into a routine.
