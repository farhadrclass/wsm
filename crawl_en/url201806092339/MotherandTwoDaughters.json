I have read thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, and yet I can always return to this book and find it as beautifully written and insightful as when I first found it.

It is set in the American South in the late 1970s and it is representative of its time. The relationships between mother and daughters is true-to-life and believable. It translates well to today. When I first read it I was the age of Cate and Lydia, while now I am in my 60s like Nell."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/412508-rebecca", "userReview": "More like 1.5 stars.

It began and ended well, but faded in the middle. Nell is the mother (a fine character) and Cate and Lydia are the daughters. Godwin is interested in how a tragic family event (in this case the death of a much loved father and husband) plays out as women search to make their lives what they want them to be. I felt that the daughters were vehicles for Godwin\u2019s ideas rather than characters with their own internal logic (or even believable illogicality). Very much an 80s work, with its exploration of women\u2019s roles. If I had read the novel then, it would have said a lot more to me. But I think Godwin rides the line well between popular and serious fiction."}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5956796-yvonne", "userReview": "After reading Father Melancholy's Daughter and Evensong, this book was a real disappointment.
