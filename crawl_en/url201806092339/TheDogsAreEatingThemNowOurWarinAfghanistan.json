Three major themes stand out for me in this book. The first is the dramatic and inexorable rise in violence in the area despite the huge increase in foreign troops who were supposed to pacify the Taliban. Smith is driven to conclude that the military incursion in fact feeds Taliban growth rather than countering it. This connects to a second theme -- that the Taliban is much more an indigenous rural rebellion rather than an externally inspired terrorist group. That rural revolt is especially spurred by US and NATO moves to eradicate local poppy crops. Inability to see these localized roots and strength brings on the overconfidence of Canadian and other foreign military commanders. A third key theme is the developing corruption of official Afghan governing structures, especially the police. Drug smuggling becomes a core factor in this and channels illicit funds to the Taliban in the process. Smith draws a grim picture and finds it hard to see hopeful prospects for the future. But at the same time he writes with great affection for southern Afghanistan and its people. His portraits of friends and contacts there are evocative and deeply sympathetic. It is striking that despite his tough assessment Smith has chosen to return and live in the country and work for the International Crisis Group. This is a vivid and important book -- a serious contribution to understanding a disappointing Canadian foreign policy experience. There are more questions its conclusions raise. What does all this say about future Canadian initiatives? How should the world respond to other extreme regimes elsewhere? Does intervention make sense in civil war situations? What this book stresses is that answers must be thought through on the basis of realistic detailed information from the ground."}, {"userName": "Alex Linschoten", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6036930-alex-linschoten", "userReview": "Read it."}, {"userName": "Carol Storm", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm", "userReview": "Powerful look at the war in Afghanistan from the perspective of a Canadian reporter who is neither a hawk nor a dove, but a clear-sighted observer with enormous compassion for both sides."}, {"userName": "Travis Lupick", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67837453-travis-lupick", "userReview": "This is not a review but is based on an interview I had with the author. It was originally published in the Georgia Straight newspaper.Fourteen seconds of silence pass on an audio recording of Graeme Smith\u2019s interview with Brig.-Gen. David Fraser. Finally, the commander answers a question about Canadian forces handing prisoners over to an Afghan penal system fraught with abuse and torture.\u201cHe knew that he was wading into deep waters by talking about detainees, and he was brave to do so,\u201d Smith recalled on the phone from Kabul, Afghanistan. \u201cBut the stuff he said wasn\u2019t accurate. He said in 2006 that nothing bad happens to these people, and he looked me in the eye and he used that reassuring tone of voice that generals have. And he was wrong.\u201dSmith, now a senior analyst with International Crisis Group, was a Globe and Mail correspondent in southern Afghanistan from 2005 to 2011.In The Dogs Are Eating Them Now: Our War in Afghanistan, Smith retraces his time in Kandahar province and a personal transformation from an \u201cexcited young journalist\u201d enthusiastic for NATO\u2019s mission to one of the war\u2019s sharpest critics. For that work, he has been nominated for the B.C. National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction, for which he\u2019s scheduled to pass through Vancouver on February 21.Smith told the Straight that although a lot of stories he covered contributed to that \u201cunravelling\u201d, as he characterized it, it was Canadian forces\u2019 culpability in the torture of prisoners passed to Afghan authorities that troubled him more than any other.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to feel like things are going well and you\u2019re on the side of good when you\u2019re getting these stories day after day after day\u2014stories about people being choked and burned and whipped and electrocuted and whatever,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe whole premise of the war was built on this idea of the rule of law\u2026.That there have to be rules of some kind. But then what was scary was when you got to Afghanistan, it was easy to see that rules were being broken. If we were going to be describing ourselves as being on the side of good, that got tougher and tougher as the years went by because we weren\u2019t behaving in a particularly good way when it came to detainees and other issues.\u201dTwo days after Smith\u2019s August 23, 2007, report on detainee abuses appeared in the Globe and Mail, Prime Minister Stephen Harper addressed the matter in Parliament and denied there was any problem. Later, Canadian forces quietly introduced some reforms concerning the handover of prisoners, but Smith said he feels there still remains a \u201cstubborn reluctance\u201d to fully take responsibility and address what happened.An inability to tackle complex and inconvenient problems in real time was one of NATO\u2019s greatest shortcomings, he said. For example, the United States and Canada for years failed to recalibrate strategies on Pakistan despite overwhelming evidence that Afghanistan\u2019s southern neighbour was playing a major role in the conflict.A reckless use of air support was another policy blunder that NATO allies were slow to acknowledge and correct, Smith continued. It could also often seem like there were parallel wars being waged in Afghanistan with little communication between the two.\u201cThe American counter-terrorism forces had a different mission and a separate chain of command from the NATO troops,\u201d he writes in the book. \u201cWhile the elite commandos hunted for threats to global security, the rest of the international forces were struggling to put down a local insurgency. Translated into action, this meant that bearded Americans ran around at night kicking down doors, while clean-shaven regular troops went on day patrols and held meetings to foster goodwill and set up the basics of government.\u201d (For more on U.S. clandestine operations in Afghanistan, read the Straight\u2019s review of Jeremy Scahill\u2019s Dirty Wars: The World as a Battlefield.)Armies that looked relatively the same but sometimes acted independently of one another created disorder that could be detrimental to all, Smith noted.\u201cThose differences between the groups of foreigners who were running around in Afghanistan were so confusing to the Afghans,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as we had trouble deciphering the different Afghan tribes, they had trouble deciphering the different groups of foreigners who were often acting at cross purposes.\u201dA passage from The Dogs Are Eating Them Now illustrates the extent to which that confusion might be detrimental to any legacy Canada hopes to leave behind in Afghanistan.\u201cThey saw all of us as Americans,\u201d Smith writes. \u201cFor years, people in Kandahar city would look at me and ask, \u2018America, yeh?\u2019 and it was hard to persuade them I was from Canada\u2014and then, to convince them Canada was a real country.\u201dStill living in Afghanistan today, Smith conceded that he sometimes finds himself depressed by the lack of progress made by a NATO force that was likely the most powerful military alliance ever assembled.\u201cWhat I think we can hold on to is hope,\u201d he added. \u201cI think despite all the massive screw-ups that I document in the book, I think there is still hope that this situation can be salvaged\u2014maybe not beautifully, but it could still be salvaged.\u201d Smith, however, noted that a major report he\u2019s produced for International Crisis Group that\u2019s scheduled to be released before the end of March warns that Afghanistan is likely headed for violence worse than it has seen in years.\u201cIt\u2019s a tough thing, trying to get Canadians to still care about Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people would rather just pretend it never happened, which is really a shame because I really feel like we have to have a sense of responsibility for this mess.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Elliot", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124403-elliot", "userReview": "Full disclosure: Graeme is a personal friend and I have an enormous amount of respect for his analysis of Afghanistan, which is based on his many years of experience in Afghanistan and his profound insight into the people, tribal dynamics, power, problems, and money of Afghanistan.While this book concentrates on a certain part of his experience in Afghanistan, it explains the complicated and frustrating situation in Afghanistan better than most other things I've read."}, {"userName": "Bobby D", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1046262-bobby-d", "userReview": "If you\u2019re not yet aware of this book and its background let me briefly explain before I get into my review. The edition I just read is the new American edition (which has an added Forward) as the book was originally published in 2013 in Canada. Graeme Smith is Canadian and covered the Afghanistan war as fought by NATO (mostly Canadian troops) in Southern Afghanistan around the city of Kandahar. He spent more time in this region than any other reporter from September 2005 to 2009, returning again in 2011 to the present time as a Senior Analyst for the International Crisis Group. When he uses the words \u201cOur War\u201d he is referring to Canada\u2019s war (although he talks about it in terms as NATOs war). Why it has taken so long for the book to be published in the United States is surprising. I first heard about it in an LA Times book review published last month. Let me begin by saying the book is an incredible read and should be read by anyone interested in the brief recent history of Afghanistan (since the fall of the Taliban). Graeme Smith\u2019s writing is crisp, informative, self-deprecating and an adventure story for the reader. Structured mostly as a memoir covering his time in South Afghanistan where he reported using translators and dressed in native cloths. The chapters take us through the years from his arrival in 2005 to the present. His journey is one of disillusionment as he changes his views and reaches counter intuitive conclusions about NATOs war strategy. Smith\u2019s reporting goes deeper than the grand strategies and goals of the global war on terror and/or nation building pealing back as he does to what life on the ground is like. This via stories about local officials, warlords, farmers, shop owners, Canadian soldiers, insurgents and the Taliban. The stories he tells are tragic, disheartening, heroic, and entertaining. One story tells about his interviewing 45 Taliban insurgents. Only three even recognized that Canada was a country and only one knew Canada was above the United States. Most said that this kind of information was not meaningful to them.  The book begins with the line, \u201cWe lost the war in Southern Afghanistan and it broke my heart.\u201d Smith saw positive about the troop surge of 2005 as bringing \u201ca whole basket of civilization to the south\u201d. Now he says that the years our armies \u201c\u2026pounded their way into the South will be remembered for the heights of violence that exceeded the gruesome body count of the Taliban wars of the 1990s.\u201d The conclusion he draws is that as the foreign footprint broadened more ordinary Afghani\u2019s were driven to side with the insurgents. In one chapter Smith sums up four lessons he learned about the war; 1) The war is a family feud, 2) Air strikes pushed people to join the insurgency, 3) Destroying poppy fields makes things worse, 4) Taliban nationalism leaves room to negotiate. Several times Smith in native dress crossed the border into Quetta, Pakistan. As I read his description of the trip and the city with its multitude of flags flying supporting various tribes I thought my god it sounds like a city out of Star Wars. Alien and unrecognizable.  There is a chapter in T. E. Lawrence\u2019s SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM where Lawrence discussed the tribes of Syria with Prince Fiscal. If the Arab revolt was to succeed and take Damascus Fiscal would need help from local Syrian tribes. Lawrence explains that Syria is divided geographically by three mountain ranges running north to south. In the east are the more educated professional and financially successful class. As one go west over the first range of mountains you find what we might call today blue collar workers and yet further to the east over another range of mountains he points out are numerous tribes of religious fundamentalists who raid, pillage and are great warriors. Fiscal points out to Lawrence that they need those in the East and Lawrence says no\u2026 the need is for those in the west. The need was for warriors, fighters who could be made to believe in a religious cause. Fiscal responded that eventually he will need this group to help govern and how could he do it with the likes of these? Lawrence replied not to worry as they will not stay to govern or to be governed as they will return to the ways of their Fathers. As I read Smith\u2019s book I though again about Lawrence\u2019s observation. Who is to say what will happen in Afghanistan when NATO leaves. Will the insurgency lose strength and return to some normality or will things break out into Civil War? That is what Smith is doing in Afghanistan now working in Kabul... he is waiting to see."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1863813-joan", "userReview": "Graeme Smith is a Canadian journalist who spent many years covering the war in Afganistan, researching the underlying issues. The book is organized in a time line with his growing impressions and knowledge of the forces at work. His research leads him to an opinion that as international force escalated, the insurgency also increased. He does not call them the Taliban, having decided that hatred of Nato brought about from ground fire fight, bombs killing their families (civilians), destruction of their crops (eradication of poppies- for most their only means of support) led to thousands of recruits from local farmers, not Taliban, but very willing to fight under their leadership, calling it revenge. He postulates three intertwined influences: The drug mafia, the elected government with power only in cities, and the tribal farmers (insurgents, maybe Taliban). Government is corrupt at every level intercepting foreign aid, and also taking payments from drug shipments on the highways built by Nato. The leaders of the insurgents intercept foreign shipments of arms, aided by government police, and also play the same game getting protection money from shipment of drugs. He describes the continuous escalation urged by leaders of foreign armed forces and politicians completely out of touch with reality on the ground."}, {"userName": "Neil Shea", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27676878-neil-shea", "userReview": "2013 was a banner year for reading as I saw it. Notable reads were by Graeme Smith The Dogs Are Eating Them Now: Our War in Afghanistan .

It was, believe me. Smith\u2019s chronicles are not strictly through the lens of the military, diplomats, government, insurgents but through his own \u2013 by getting out amongst and befriending the Afghan population at considerable risk. As I saw it, this asserted creditability to his theme that western involvement although amiable and good intentioned was misguided and at times ineffectual.Reminds me a few years ago at our local Quebec Major Junior hockey games and the \u201cmilitary appreciation nights\u201d The topic of Afghanistan was front and center on all the displays and we were encouraged to get \u201ceducated\u201d.

In fact, you'll only find more questions that beg for answers -- and our collective attention.If you rely on the Canadian government for answers, you'll get jingoistic claims of success -- including that Canada successfully secured Kandahar (the size of Nova Scotia) \"with just 2,500 soldiers,\" without a hint that anything ever went wrong beyond the initial deployment.That's contradicted in Smith's first line of the book. \"We lost the war in Southern Afghanistan, and it broke my heart,\" he writes in the beginning of an engrossing narrative, chronicling four years of his time spent investigating the mission and its repercussions. We'll recall some of his stories: interviews with detainees claiming torture at the hands of Afghan captors, which threatened to sink the Conservative minority government with its first scandal, as well as an acclaimed Emmy-winning video series called \"Talking to the Taliban\" that offered rare insight into the mind frames of those fighting against Western forces.But there are underlying themes that many Canadians will likely not have picked up on; themes that slowly begin to dawn on Smith as he becomes further embedded in the country. They include the realizations that far too many mistakes were made by international forces and that there were far too many miscalculations and misunderstandings about just how to bring peace and stability to a land desperate for it.Read more here: http://rabble.ca/books/reviews/2014/0..."}, {"userName": "Smiley938", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31741887-smiley938", "userReview": "Having very little understanding of the Afghanistan War to begin with, this book was informative and interesting but still easy to understand.

The company had not purchased any protection from the insurgents, he said, so the foreigner became fair game for kidnapping. Taliban grabbed him, received a ransom of $500,000, and set him free. The Chinese firm arranged to pay a monthly protection fee to the local Taliban in that district, and an identical amount to Hizb-e-Islami militia operating nearby. This insurance proved useful two days later, when bandits kidnapped the same Chinese engineer. Hizb-e-Islami gunmen tracked down the kidnappers and forced them to hand over the hostage, unharmed, and set him free a second time. At that point, he said, the Kabul government issued public statements crowing about how Afghan security forces had pressured the insurgents into giving up the kidnap victim.

He writes with gritty realism (don't bring a weak stomach) and spends time with soldiers, local people and even Taliban. Upshot of his analysis: we made a huge mistake. We thought sending Western well-armed, good soldiers would make the people of southern Afghanistan want to be and behave just like us. If that didn't work, we sent more soldiers. When that didn't work . . . Well. So now we are withdrawing most soldiers. Probably for the best, since the surge didn't really work. But if we just leave all these people to their own devices . . . we have no idea what could happen. Actually it seems we never did. The author concludes that we never really understood the Afghan people and what they really wanted. And he genuinely respects the soldiers he embedded with--but even good soldiers can't square circles. Wrong policies won't improve the situation, even with good soldiers there. He exposes evidence of deep and thorough corruption at all levels of Afghan society and government (he has to leave the country after publishing evidence the Afghan official in charge of drug enforcement sells opium.)

Smith does not attempt to write an all encompassing work on the history, analysis and military strategy in Afghanistan. Instead he simply presents his experiences and knowledge gathered on the ground, which does not purport to be anything more. This gives the book real power in presenting the facts and observations so starkly for the reader to absorb.

I'm amazed by the personal sacrifice that journalists make in reporting on a war zone. It's unfortunate I don't recall reading G. Smith in the Globe and Mail while he was covering the War in Afghanistan.I think this book will at least continue to raise awareness about the tremendous sacrifice that soldiers and other participants made in Afghanistan. I think the Government of Canada has done a tremendous disservice in not acknowledging to Canadians that the nation was at war in Afghanistan. Canadians deserve mature debate on our role internationally."}, {"userName": "Bernie Charbonneau", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2377704-bernie-charbonneau", "userReview": "A fascinating perspective of Canadian involvement in Afghanistan until our troop pullout in 2011. Mr. Smith not only just covers the NATO side of the conflict but does a very good job of enlightening the reader to both sides of the debacle that resulted in wasted lives and energy. Whether you are pro or con for the original initiative that resulted in a decade of fighting, this is a good read in just a few pages to get an understanding of what we are actually there for in the first place. A very well written novel that covers about six years of the more gruesome battles and politics from a country that is far different than the average person will ever encounter in his or her life time. Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Dan  Ray", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15817864-dan-ray", "userReview": "I thought this was a very well thought-out and well presented summation of the \"Afghan Problem\" presented to the modern world. Graeme Smith went out into the world and did true journalism, without the grandiose posing of most war-time correspondants. The story (as exemplified by the title) shows clearly how power and money used without clear direction can't fix any complex problem. The best trained and equipped troops in the world can go into a country and kick butt, however if their leadership lacks a fundamental understanding of the problem and a route to the solution, then victory is impossible."}, {"userName": "Norm", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29015467-norm", "userReview": "Highly recommended, a great read. My only complaint is its brevity, at less than 300 pages. I could have read another 300 pages of his reporting and insights.It succeeds by not trying to be something it's not; that is, it does not try to be a definitive account of the West's mission in Afghanistan, it is instead a very personal account of one journalist's experiences through tumultuous years in the country's recent history.He is saddened and disappointed by how things have turned out, but I was glad to see he was light on offering answers for future improvements (although he does remain optimistic). If there is one thing to be learned from this adventure, is there are no easy answers."}, {"userName": "Trevor Kew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7860789-trevor-kew", "userReview": "I've always felt the war in Afghanistan to be frustratingly opaque and confusing (even compared to Iraq) even when reading the dispatches of prominent journalists. For that reason, it was a real joy to discover Graeme Smith's first-hand account of his time as a journalist in the south of Afghanistan. Smith's own frustrations with the conflict, both in terms of understanding what it going on and struggling to comprehend why certain choices are made by all sides, is both a page-turner and an important record of what it is like on the ground in a country that has made so many headlines in the first decade of this century but which is still so poorly understood."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48993498-william", "userReview": "Excellent book. Easy to read without overwhelming history and political slants or biases. This was a balanced book which illustrates so many reasons why nation building in Afghanistan isn't as simple as some would have us believe or think. The author identified the main issues as well as the complicated politics behind them without taking either left or right wing biases (in my opinion). I thoroughly enjoyed this book and certainly learned many new reasons why Afghanistan will likely never attain the Western style of democracy."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19716949-tony", "userReview": "A highly engrossing read of things that went wrong in Afghanistan. Might have gotten 5 stars had I not already read \"No Good Men Among the Living,\" which breathes more life into the conflict than this one. Graeme Smith's reporting is a credit to journalists who have struggled to provide accurate portrayals of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (especially the former once resources and attention turned toward Iraq after that war started)."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51736213-chris", "userReview": "An informed look at the 'Afghanistan situation'. Smith takes us through years of ground level journalism, starting as a fresh off the plane to world weary, the transition is terrible to read. The abuse of the Afghanis by the rest of the well-meaning world, is terrible to behold. That we continue to treat people as though they are children, is absolutely shocking. Hard to write an objective review when you're filled with anger. This is a great book to read if you want an eye opener about something other than the 'war of terror' idiocy that most are looking for."}], "description": "For readers of War by Sebastian Junger, We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families by Philip Gourevitch, and The Forever War by Dexter Filkins: The Dogs Are Eating Them Now is a raw, uncensored account of the war in Afghanistan from a brilliant young reporter who for several years was the only Western journalist brave enough to live full-time in the dangerous southern region. The Dogs are Eating Them Now is a highly personal narrative of our war in Afghanistan and how it went dangerously wrong. Written by a respected and fearless former foreign correspondent who has won multiple awards for his journalism (including an Emmy for the video series \"Talking with the Taliban\") this is a gripping account of modern warfare that takes you into back alleys, cockpits and prisons--telling stories that would have endangered his life had he published this book while still working as a journalist.From the corruption of law enforcement agents and the tribal nature of the local power structure to the economics of the drug trade and the frequent blunders of foreign troops, this is the no-holds-barred story from a leading expert on the insurgency. Smith draws on his unmatched compassion and a rare ability to cut through the noise and see the broader truths to give us a bold and candid look at the Taliban's continued influence--and at the mistakes, catastrophes and ultimate failure of the West's best intentions.", "title": "The Dogs Are Eating Them Now: Our War in Afghanistan", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13132085-the-dogs-are-eating-them-now", "average": 4.08, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1367929758l/13132085.jpg", "reviews": 56, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16546244.Graeme_Smith", "name": "Graeme       Smith"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "War", "History", "Politics", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13132085-the-dogs-are-eating-them-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24535566-the-dogs-are-eating-them-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13533225-the-dogs-are-eating-them-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2737488-a-short-history-of-secularism", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/812354.Frommer_s_Beijing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18637382-was-the-tomb-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2737490-gastrointestinal-nursing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17258022-road-like-a-river"]}
