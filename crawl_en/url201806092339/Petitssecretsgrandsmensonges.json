I was thoroughly captivated, found this to be brilliant in plot, structure and tone. Gulped it right down. On the surface this was about a group of parents whose children were starting kindergarten. We have the typical cliques, the do-goobers and many, many who think their children are oh so special.Over parenting to a T. Working moms against stay at home moms, fulfillment vs. involvement. Humorously told, there are so many times this book had me laughing, some of these moms were so over the top, absolutely absurd.Under the surface was another layers, the author tackles many issues, among them bullying, spousal abuse and others. These women and their marriages all have issues, problems with their marriages, dealing with traumas from the past. Considering everything that was tackled in this book it should not have worked but it did, and that is to the author's credit.Everything leads up to trivia night at the school and that will bring revelations, disasters and many will find themselves changed. Loved every minute of this one."}, {"userName": "Roxane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane", "userReview": "No, I haven\u2019t seen the TV show. This book is fine. It\u2019s certainly readable and hard to put down. I enjoyed reading Big Little Lies. But it\u2019s shallow. Yes, it deals with domestic violence and sexual assault and the pressures and pettiness of white middle class and upper class womanhood when it comes to their social lives and their children and so on, but everything here is easy, frothy. And that\u2019s fine. Not every book needs to carry the weight of the world. But at the same time, some of what this book deals with is serious and so it makes the frothiness aggravating at times. Also, it just needs to be said, this is a very white book. Again, every book doesn\u2019t need to be everything buuuuut, I guess only white people go to the elementary school at the center of this narrative which, given Sydney\u2019s reasonably diverse population speaks to how segregated the world is. Look, I hate having a brain, too. I wish I could just turn it off and enjoy froth for froth\u2019s sake. Also, this book is brutally well written. You can absolutely see the structure and how the plot was assembled and what each character is supposed to do. There\u2019s an interesting twist at the end. There is lots of relatable mommy content but I am not a mother so I rolled my eyes at all the gilded mother suffering (not the abuse/sexual violence obviously, just the harried mom stuff). I get it, I get it. Everything resolves very tidily and satisfyingly. This book is a fine template for how to write a massive bestseller, if you want to do that sort of thing."}, {"userName": "Nancy McFarlane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3130731-nancy-mcfarlane", "userReview": "Liane Moriarty has done it again \u2013 written a book that kept me up way too late because I couldn\u2019t put it down. She has a knack for creating characters who are so believable they could easily be someone you know. Big Little Lies is a story of parents acting badly. It is also a smart and witty story about the real lives of children, teens, friends, husbands, wives, second wives, and exes. You are teased from the beginning with something awful that happens at the annual Pirriwee Public School fund raising. You know the what but not the who or the how. Along the way you discover some of the dangerous little lies that people tell just to be able to face the day. I couldn\u2019t wait to get to the end to find out what happened that night but at the same time I was sorry that I wouldn\u2019t be reading any more about the inhabitants of Perriwee."}, {"userName": "Marina Finlayson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31376685-marina-finlayson", "userReview": "You know how sometimes you get to the end of a book and you wish you could wipe it from your mind, just so you could have the pleasure of reading it for the first time again?This is one of those books.I can't think of another author off the top of my head who does relationships so well and with such humour as Liane Moriarty. Her characters love and laugh, rub each other up the wrong way, extend the hand of friendship, spread gossip, resolve to do better, cry and keep secrets -- just like real people.In Big Little Lies, the little lies we tell ourselves and others -- sometimes to disguise the big ones -- blow up into murder and mayhem at the P&C Trivia Night at the local public school. Though we know someone has died from the beginning of the novel, we don't find out who it is till the end, as we go back through the histories of the participants to uncover the nagging jealousies and seething problems that led to the fatal moment.So we spend the book in a state of breathless anticipation and worry. Who died? Was it bubbly Madeline, struggling to connect with the teenage daughter of her first marriage? Or beautiful Celeste, whose perfect life hides an ugly secret? Or was it single mum Jane, trying to start afresh, who finds that playground bullying isn't just for the kids any more?Moriarty will keep you up late flipping pages as you follow the story of these three and the colourful characters who surround them, desperate to find out who died -- and why. The answer is enormously satisfying."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "Read for Book Riot's 2017 Read Harder reading challenge: #11 Read a book that is set more than 5000 miles from your locationI was SO not expecting to love this as much as I did. dang.*review (still) to come*"}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin", "userReview": "I think Stephen King summed up Big Little Lies perfectly when he said it is \"a hell of a book, funny and scary.\" I found it to be like the first two seasons of Desperate Housewives before the show started to slowly fall apart (and I've seen every episode so I feel like I'm right... right about the comparison to the book and the fact that the show was never all that great after the first two seasons, but the bigger question is why did I watch all of the show in the first place, and I'll never really know the answer to that question, but I'm OK with it and can live with myself). The moms in Big Little Lies are written so well. I loved all the different stereotypes represented in each of them and how the different dynamics played out between them and their families. I'll admit, I was a little confused early on and could have used a family tree to help me see who belonged where (and that only got messier along the way), but Moriarty kept me updated in subtle ways to make sure I was tracking with her as the story unfolded. Hang on, taking a quick coffee break. Alright, much better. There are a couple of other takeaways from the book I want to share. First off, the whole suburban-everything-is-awesome facade in which the book is firmly nestled, and in which I find myself now. I really loved how the book started out in a fun, whimsical way by introducing me to the various characters and making me feel like everyone has everything together and life is just so swell all the time. Then, as the book rolls along, more and more is revealed from the past, mysteries are solved, and you learn that these women's lives just aren't what you thought they were. And, man, isn't that life? All of us walking around all carefree making sure everyone thinks we are just fine and dandy thank you very much, and maybe there aren't things as dark as some stuff in this book happening, but we are all stressed out with kids and jobs and life and whatever. Anyway, I just liked that slow descent into the darker layers of the major characters in the story. That's all I'm saying. So no spoilers, but I thought it was important for me as someone who isn't a woman to read about how events can shape the lives and thought of someone who is a woman. That's a lot of unnecessary words. What I'm trying to say is you never know how much your actions can impact another person. In this case, the words and actions of men had a deep emotional impact on women. Some of it was tough to read, and to know that stuff is happening that we often don't even know about is scary. It's bad enough that so much evil and darkness exists out there, but what about all the stuff that hasn't been brought into the light yet? Life is hard. And, last but not least, the minor characters chiming in at the end of many chapters to kick in a little foreshadowing was an excellent plot device. That trivia night was something I was anticipating from the very beginning. The timeline worked down to that single night, and there was lots of statements from police questioning sprinkled in early so the mystery slowly rolls down to that night and a little beyond. It made the book so easy and quick to read, but it wasn't some mindless page turner to just get through for mild enjoyment. It was written really well, and the payoff in the end was worth it. I may have to get some more Liane Moriarty in my life. I never thought I would say that out loud, but here we are. Looking forward to the HBO series!"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "If I said I loved this one, it would be a Big Fat Lie. But I definitely LIKED it, despite the rough beginning.Here is my love story with Moriarty books, and it doesn\u2019t stay all lovey-dovey, I\u2019ll tell you that. But that sounds dramatic\u2014I need to say that I don\u2019t hate her books now, it\u2019s just that the honeymoon is way over. I became an avid fan after reading What Alice Forgot, which is about a woman who hits her head and forgets her identity. I thought it was completely brilliant, and it made me think.High from that experience, I then went on to The Husband's Secret. Since I couldn\u2019t forget What Alice Forgot, and I thought Moriarty could do no wrong, I glistened and glowed about that book, too, even though the spark had started to go out a little, if I had been honest with myself. I was still euphoric from the first book and didn\u2019t want to admit that the second one wasn\u2019t as good. Whereas What Alice Forgot made me ponder ideas (about memory and identity, for example), there was no such hook in The Husband\u2019s Secret. It was a good book and I enjoyed reading it, but it was definitely lighter. I anxiously awaited Big Little Lies.After I\u2019d read the first few chapters of Big Little Lies, I had to admit I just wasn\u2019t wowed. First off, two of the main characters seemed really superficial. I asked myself, do I have to hang out with these rich, beautiful, and self-absorbed airheads who are taking this kindergarten thing way too seriously? I was beginning to understand why Moriarty\u2019s books are often categorized as chick lit.Plus, there was a stylistic gimmick (a sort of Greek chorus) that I hated because it made the book confusing. The story is about three moms whose kids are entering the same kindergarten class. We learn right away that there has been a scandalous death. The way we learn about the death is through gossipy conversations, like little asides, splashed throughout the story. It\u2019s these little asides that I had trouble with. Each comment has a name preceding it, and there are too many names to keep track of. It drove me nuts! But wait, was I supposed to actually keep track of them, or ignore which gossiper said what and just concentrate on the gossip itself? It wasn\u2019t clear what I was supposed to do, and that sucked. It was just too much work, which made it impossible to have a smooth reading experience. Moriarty, you shouldn\u2019t make the reader work that hard. It should be a seamless experience. I was pissed that there were all these unknown and undeveloped characters whispering important secrets. It\u2019s hard to sit still and enjoy the gossip if you\u2019re busy trying to figure out who\u2019s who.I eventually recognized some of the people, but still, some of the gossipers weren\u2019t real players in the drama, so why give them names? It was a stylistic technique that didn\u2019t work for me. On paper, it\u2019s a cool way to dole out clues, but maybe it has to look different. Maybe the author should have made some or all of the whisperers anonymous? I don\u2019t know. It just drove me crazy.I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m poo-poo\u2019ing this book so much, because I did end up liking it. As the book progressed, what I thought were shallow characters became way more complicated and interesting\u2014and I did get invested in all of them.And really, a lot of important issues are addressed: domestic violence, bullying, rape, and teenagers posting scary shit on the web. The way the characters handle these issues is realistic and satisfying without being predictable, sappy, or preachy.And there\u2019s lots of suspense\u2014I always looked forward to opening the book; it soon moved into the \u201cjuicy read\u201d category. The story is rich and it\u2019s twisty as all get out. The ending is very satisfying, and everything is tied up nicely. One final complaint, though: the book is way too long. This should have been a 250- or 300-pager; it\u2019s not epic or important or engaging enough to warrant 480 pages.Final verdict: It took me a while to get into it and trust that Moriarty was once again going to spin a good yarn. And she does. That little imitation Greek chorus thing made me knock the rating down to 3 stars. But ah, shucks, I really do like you, Moriarty--even if I did feel compelled to go back and remove one of my stars for The Husband\u2019s Secret!Update: March 2017Catch the 8-part HBO series if you can (it's on the 5th segment, but some of you with HBO might be able to watch the earlier segments). It stars Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, and Laura Dern (all are excellent), and it's filmed in beautiful Monterey. I'm loving it; like it better than the book. And the Greek chorus works way better. I even downloaded the theme song!"}, {"userName": "Aestas Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5604583-aestas-book-blog", "userReview": "\"A murder. A tragic accident.... Someone is dead. But who did what?\"\n\nWOAHHHH!!!! This book was freaking amazing!!!\u00a0It\u00a0was a total genre change for me -- this is women's fiction and mystery, not romance -- but I was just in the kind of mood where I was craving something totally different than what I usually read.... so I tried this one! And I was BEYOND impressed with it.Like holy WOW impressed.The writing was\u00a0\n  fantastic\n\u00a0\u2014 starkly honest, detailed, introspective, observant, multi-sided\u2026 the story kept me guessing right up until the end. There were these\u00a0\n  twists\n\u00a0that totally shocked me (I mean like jaw-drop omgdidnotseethatcoming shocked) and I just had these chiiiiiiills run through me at some of the\u00a0reveals.This author really just \"gets\"\u00a0people and interactions on a very deep level in a way I\u2019ve seldom seen before. Gah. It was \n  powerful\n. I mean really. Holy woman power!!! I loved the writing, I loved story, and can honestly say that it had one of the single most satisfying endings ever. EVER.So... what's it about?It has a large cast of characters, but focuses mostly on three women's lives. They all have children entering Kindergarten in the same year. They're lives are vastly different but closely connected in ways that even they don't realize at first. And there's a murder. Someone dies at a trivia night. But you don't know who. And you don't know who killed them. No clue!\u00a0Part of the whole mystery is figuring this out, and it's done in such a cool way -- a fascinating mix between the story of the weeks counting down to\u00a0that night mixed in with snippets of interviews being given\u00a0after that night of people describing what happened.I'm not going to say a word more\u00a0but\u00a0I will assure you that the ending\u00a0delivers on every level!This whole book\u00a0really highlights how the same event can be seen in so many ways, from so many different perspectives, and from each of those sides, it can appear vastly different. You\u00a0never\u00a0really know what someone else is thinking or going through, what they're capable of, what secrets they're keeping...Gah. Fascinating!!!Just so you know, this is not a dark read at all. It's very serious at times, very light at others. But it's also not dark and it's not scary. A few people were asking me so I thought I'd clarify that.Actually I saw someone describe it as a \"juicy drama\" and I think that's the\u00a0perfect description!It's just the kind of story that raises a million questions in your mind. It makes you THINK, keeps you wondering, theorizing, questioning everything. It's detailed and engaging. Can you tell I loved it?There are some very serious themes -- domestic violence, single parenthood, motherhood in general, bullying, murder, secrets, and more. It's almost scarily\u00a0accurate in many of it's depictions.Hehe this was my status update from 91%:\nGAAAASPPPPPPPPP \u2014 did NOT see that coming!!!! Holy SHITTTTT!!CHILLS. O_OHOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. I mean WOAH. WOAH. WOAHHHHHH. \nThis author is just so skilled. The plot was cleverly woven and it just delivered all the right details at all the right times. In fact, I think I actually have all of a certain chapter highlighted. ALL of it.It was an incredible reading experience. I totally get why they\u2019re making it into a movie (with Reese Witherspoon & Nicole Kidman) because I could literally picture it in my mind as I was reading.I have a ton of quotes highlighted in my book, but in case you're wondering why I don't have them included in this review, it's because in retrospect, I realized that given this type of story, they might not make sense out of context. So I'm just going to let you read the book for yourself and read them that way!I've also read another book by this author, The Husband's Secret, and even though I thought that one was really good, I actually loved this one more because I was much happier with this ending. This one left me with such a strongly good feeling while The Husband's Secret left me feeling a little... unsettled (like the price paid was too great)... but this one was just WOW.I highly recommend it!Rating: 5 STARS!!

Looking at the reviews it seems to have quite a range of ratings. But recently I decided to write a short one as I recently heard what I thought was exciting news. Well exciting for me as a lover of this book!!I was looking through the new line-up of fall TV shows and came across a 2016 TV series entitled \"Big Little Lies\". At first I thought it was a coincidence but then looked on IMDb and it said for the series summary:Things take a dark turn for a group of moms whose perfect lives begin to unravel.So far not a lot more information but it does say it's starring Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon. I love Reese and l am so excited to see her in this. I love the fact that it is a series and not just a movie! Now as I'm typing this I'm wondering if this is old news. I read through some reviews and didn't see it mentioned but if it was oops... it's new to me though!!Murder at a school trivia night ....

She's not happy about any of this but it is what it is. And it makes her a bit crazy which is understandable. Jane is a single mom to Ziggy whom she loves very much.

Mel Old 2015 ReviewWhen I first started this book I was confused and not sure I could get through it because I checked out the audio version from my library. But.. I soon got into it and starting learning about the characters and fell in love with it. This book WILL be put on my Amazon wishlist to be bought and read again! I loved listening to these people's lives. Each person had a sad story to tell, just regular life for most people. I was so upset when little Ziggy was targeted as a bully when he was not, and this in turn made people and children start bullying him! I didn't think that was right. I was so glad to find out the real reason behind all of that and to find out that Ziggy was a little trooper for it. We all know the book starts out with a murder by the blurb and anyone that has read the first of the book. But it doesn't say who or what, it goes right into telling about the people involved on that fateful night and their lives. I was so shocked at the end. I DID NOT see that one coming at all. It's not just about trying to figure out who murdered who..whom? You think you might know what's going to happen by the things being told about these stories of each woman's life, but you just don't. There are several little surprises in the book and a few people you would like to beat into a pulp. I just thoroughly loved this book. I have to say this is the first book I have read by this author but it's not going to the last if they are as good as this one!MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "I can't NOT give this book 5 stars. There's truly nothing I didn't like about it. It's one of those special books that completely captured my attention\u2014while I was reading it, I was lost in the characters' lives. And that's one of the things that makes this book soooo good: the characters. Moriarty is a master at crafting vivid characters from the first page. I felt like with each introduction of a new character, I had a grasp on their personality pretty quickly. But they weren't boiled down to that single moment of characterization; they were complex, flawed people who you could root for and empathize with. On top of that was a well-crafted, engaging and suspenseful plot that kept you turning the pages. I was never bored. And her writing style was substantial and had a lot to say about real issues. This book isn't afraid to go to some dark places, but it brings with it a bit of comedy and sometimes even a little sappiness that satisfies your appetite for a little bit of everything in one book. It's definitely a book that compelled me to read on, and also to want to read more from this author...and I'm sure it'll be one that stays in my mind for a long time."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Note: To My friends I've already had discussions about this book 'while' reading it (several of us were reading it together) -- You might be surprise to see me giving this book 3 Stars.I'm sure you thought I might give it 1 star --or 2 stars. I was planning on it!!!! I think there are TONS of PROBLEMS with this novel ---and there is MUCH I DO NOT LIKE about this BOOK --However --Approx. the last 58 pages make a strong 'punch' --my rating goes UP. First let me talk about the problems:The author takes much too long (about 400 pages too long with ongoing 'mommy-ramblings'. (gossip, stilottos shoes, catty judgements of one another, etc.) ---While all this time -- the important issues at hand are not being developed well. The important issues are being over-shadowed by too much mommy-drama. (making the book look very shallow and VERY boring) We have Blond moms, a young single mom, a-gorgeous-Mom, 'take-action' moms in their children's school policies -- divorce mom's , husbands, kids, and a school. --- A child is being accused of being a bullyAnd --we know domestic violence is part of one of the mom's marriage (is being kept a secret from even her close friends)We know a child was born by from violence --Yet---For those 400 pages --sooooooooooooooooo little is talked about these issues ---And we wait --And we wait --And we wait --We wait for the school \"Trivia Night\" (Interesting Name --don't ya think?) --which is chosen for the Schools big Parent function? --- As the book was filled with 400 pages worth of trivia, and in some cases just ABSURD 'responses'. (lacking in dignity)Here is a Perfect example of a response lacking dignity: On the top of page 118 --Madeline is having a conversation with a friends 'mother' named Di. Di is worried about her daughter, Jane. Jane is 24 years old (a mom herself). Jane is friends with Madeline who is 40 years old.Di tells Madeline that she is happy Madeline is friends with Jane --(looking after her) --Jane is a single mom. Di tells Madeline that her daughter is doing a beautiful job raising her son, does not take a cent from them. But that she has changed.Here is the exact conversation now: Di is speaking: \"Its like this deep unhappiness that she tries to hide. I don't know if its depression or drugs or an eating disorder or what. She got painfully thin! She use to be quite voluptuous\". THE RESPONSE: \"Well, said Madeline, thinking, if it's an eating disorder, you probably gave it to her\"THERE are SOOOOOOOOO Many things wrong with that RESPONSE (even if she was just 'thinking' it) ---for the author to type it in her book --- I read that part over and over ---and see NO purpose for it. I read it to friends yesterday ---(they each felt ANGRY --such as I did) ---It was such a dis-respectful sentence --that I almost threw the book away right there.However --- I kept reading ---to give this a fair review --and to share with my friends ---and because I loved 2 other books by this author. (VERY MUCH). So....Then WHY the 3 stars??By page 400 ---this author is 'on' fire! (must give credit where credit is). It becomes the same thrill ride as \"The Husband's Secret\" ....and in 'some' ways even better ---because she 'FINALLY' does drive home an important issue. And...It is an important issue....(she does it well)!!! We are on the edge! We even get a couple of surprises! (which is always fun) Is this book worth reading? Yes ---if you know ahead of time --you will be reading about 'mommy-wars' --(the culture around mom's & schools & kids).If this is a subject you are still interested in --then you might like the ENTIRE book.If you are 60+ years of age ---you 'might' pass on this book. Or ---you 'might' enjoy it for what it is ---(NOT as good as \"The Husband's Secret\") ---but wonderful ending! And....important messages...so for the important messages ---My rating goes UP!NOTE: If this book makes a difference in 1 woman's life --(then its really worth 5 stars) -- Which by the way...is how I feel about ALL BOOKS. If a book makes a transforming experience to a person --then that's powerful.Truth --(for me) --I didn't need to read this book -- Yet --I see the value!

It\u2019s orientation day into kindergarten when one boy is accused of choking a little girl. For the parents it\u2019s a moment when bonds are formed and lines are drawn in the sand. A full complement of emotions are cleverly weaved throughout. Laughter, tears, smiles and pain. Three wonderful friends (Madeline, Celeste and Jane) brought together on that orientation day by their children. The adventures they share together as well as their private struggles at home. Broken dreams, broken hearts and broken families. And the healing of hearts and souls.\"Every relationship has its glitches. It's ups, its downs.\"Everything revolves around something as simple as trivia night at the school. Then a situation arises that has both police and media questioning everyone present. The responses from the interviews are hilarious! I was always on the look-out for more of these little gems as a tasty bonus, near the end of every chapter.There are two distinct sides to this book. The fun, whimsical side that leaves you with a permanent grin on your face, desperately wanting to be part of this group of friends. Then, of course, there\u2019s the dark side that proves you never really know what goes on in the privacy of one's home. Even between the closest of friends. There are three sides to every person\u2026the side we show to everyone else, the side we show to friends and loved ones, and the side we show only to ourselves. In other words, this book is simply about life. Those we love and those that make us crazy. Very often, one in the same! I loved every minute of this book. Occasionally shaking my head at the silliness. Never expecting a twist in this story...I got a delicious jaw-dropping moment! Like icing on a cake.I absolutely adored this book! I am so sad it's finished. Now onward to the TV series!"}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "I didn't think that I would ever finish this audiobook. I liked this story, but it took a long time for me to get into. Initially, I had a hard time keeping the mothers and their children straight. Once I had finally got that straight, the story seemed to move a long a little faster, but not by much. I know a lot of people loved this book, but I guess it just didn't knock my socks off. I had high hopes for this book and feel a little let down. It was good, but not as great as I'd been expecting.This book tells the story of several mothers whose children attend the same elementary school. When one of the children, Ziggy, is accused of bullying a little girl, a war is waged between the parents, who seemed to be the biggest bullies throughout the book. One of the parents ends up dead and the story is largely told through flashbacks, as the other parents provide their statements.Mostly, this book made me think of that song, 'Harper Valley PTA'. I couldn't get interested in some of the catty, hypocritical chatter among the moms about one another. As a result, I never felt like I connected with any of the main characters. I think I might have enjoyed this one more if it weren't so long and redundant.There is some content r/t abuse, which may be a trigger for some people. This story serves as a good reminder that things aren't always as they appear on the outside. The last 25% of the book becomes more interesting and truths are revealed. I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, but wish it would have arrived sooner. All in all, it was okay. It won't be a story I reread, but I've read far worse."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "someone hand me a bucket for all these emotions QUICKLY I DONT KNOW WHERE TO PUT THEM HOW ABOUT A TUBfull review to come"}, {"userName": "Susanne Strong", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne-strong", "userReview": "4.5 Wickedly Delightful Stars!Well color me SHOCKED! Liane Moriarty wrote a book I actually liked.  A LOT.  BAAH! To be frank, I didn\u2019t think it possible.. I\u2019ve read two of her others and they were just ok \u2013 but this one was kind of fabulous. It was believable, captivating, compelling, hilarious and sad all at the same time. And the DRAMA!! Oh boy!  Little Big Lies is about Women. Strong Independent Women. Crazy Catty Women. Women who take sides against each other, sometimes for good reason, sometimes for no reason at all. The three women are at the heart of this wicked novel are: Madeline, Celeste and Jane. What binds all of the women together is that they are mothers of Kindergarteners at Pirriwee Public School. On the day of orientation, Jane\u2019s son Ziggy is accused of bullying Renata\u2019s daughter, Amabella. Renata is irate. Madeline sticks up for new friend Jane because she loves the attention, and because she sees Jane struggling and realizes Jane can\u2019t fight Renata on her own. Tensions ensue and lines are drawn. Madeline loves fighting for a cause and helping Jane is a nice distraction. She is losing her fourteen year-old daughter Abigail to her first husband Nathan and his new wife Bonnie (who she sort of hates). Of course it doesn\u2019t help that Bonnie and Nathan\u2019s youngest daughter Skye is in the same kindergarten class as Chloe, Madeline and her new husband Ed\u2019s youngest. All Madeline can think is How. Dare. He. Celeste has always been the beautiful, rich and generous one. People are completely enamored of her. She and her husband Perry are the epitome of class and their twins Max and Josh make them the perfect family. Little does anyone know, their lives are far from perfect, though Celeste is one heck of an actress.Jane is a young single mother and she is new to Pirriwee. She makes the decision to move her son Ziggy there to be close to the beach, thinking it\u2019ll be good for him. Even before the move however, the Kindy orientation makes a mess of things for Ziggy and her. Hoping that everything will be forgotten by the time the move happens, Jane goes through with it. Luckily for her, she has both Madeline and Celeste on her side. And thank goodness for that \u2013 because Renata and most of the other mothers have it in for her and for Ziggy and the claws come out. Immediately upon Jane moving to Piriwee, a trivia night is scheduled and something happens wherein the police and the media question all the guests and the storyline switches between the past, when Ziggy is accused of bullying, and slowly moving forward to the present day. All of the women in this story are highly emotional, sometimes crazy, yet completely believable. Parts of this story had me laughing out loud, mainly those chapters having to do with Madeline, who is a crazy attention seeking woman who has an intense love for her friends and for those things she is passionate about. Celeste is an incredible woman and her journey is one I couldn\u2019t begin to understand. As for Jane, she is a sweetheart. In short, the character\u2019s personalities drew me in completely. The novel was fantastic \u2013 it held my interest, and the writing was stupendous.  So, for the first time, I can honestly say that Liane Moriarty wrote a book that I absolutely loved. So why the 4.5 Star rating v. the 5 Star rating? There were a few little things that I thought were a implausible and I also thought that the ending wrapped up a little too nicely, but all in all, I thought that the book was pretty darn fantastic. I am looking forward to seeing what Ms. Moriarty has up her sleeve next. And yes Ms. Sabrina you were right, I admit it!

Sure, Madeline curses a lot, but the inner emotions of each is not so different from the others.This hiccup aside, the rest of the inhabitants, their relationships with each other is presented with almost scientific relish. The author is very much on top of her game, and I don't know how can she top this book. It's an original take on an old idea which is an endorsement, make no mistake about that.The pages just flew by, like that. Pacing does a lot for me, so I was thrilled when not only the denouement is presented with a bow tied to it, but the way we reached the end is breathtaking. Take a bow Liane Moriarty.

Yes, I had a couple of reservations initially. Lunches and coffees at the cafe, almost daily?? (Only cause I can't do it!). All the chatter about heels and fashion and this and that. But!! Liane Moriarty captured the internal dialogue perfectly, amazingly. So many times the mums were thinking things that do happen. The internal thoughts were spot on. Image, rivalry, one-up-manship, self perception and the shakey ground that so many girls and women find themselves in in regards to how we see ourselves. Yes many were a million or a zillion times exaggerated, but this is a piece fiction and fiction is fun!We all like reading about people that are similar (even semi similar) to us. I can relate with sooo many things in this book. Buying shoes off ebay that I wouldn't be able to afford at full price being one of them! Maybe even an ankle twist or two, just not on the first day of kindy in stilletos though!! This epic story tells us about the messy, intricate, and full of lies stories of new found and firm friends, Celeste, Jane and Maddie as they battle the crazy world of school mums in a well to do area. Ok, a lot of the goings on sound over the top, but the nuances and insecurities are there in every school yard. Albeit mainly in our heads..I've read many comments here that some of the dialogue in the book are inappropriate, but it is my firm opinion that the author is so skilled in her writing and knowledge of everyday 'mum' nuances that in doing so she has created the best story of friendship that you could find. Another very cool feature was the dialogue of the mums, dads and teachers involved in the mysterious death of someone that dies right from the start. Who could it be? Who were they rivals with? This mum kicked that mum in the sandpit. You may think this sounds trite but it's what makes it the perfect book that it is. I loved it, I loved the honesty, the trivial parts, the serious parts, the characters, the setting (who doesn't love the Northern Beaches!), the dialogue and the complete and utter Aussieness of it. This is a draw card for me. Maybe that's why some out there didn't get it like I did. I don't usually gush, but man, Liane Moriarty I salute you! Loved it loved it loved it. Aussie intricacies, family intricacies, girlfriend intricacies. Mother intricacies. They are brittle at times, yes?! Liane does all fiction so well.And yes, perfect for a movie..Please read it if you haven't already, discussions will be fun!!!!!!!!Have met the author (see my profile pics) - she walks the talk. Love it!"}, {"userName": "Mohammed Arabey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13592557-mohammed-arabey", "userReview":

Set in Australia in a Sydney suburb, it has the measure of certain small communities and focuses on three women. Madeline is feeling bitter about her ex-husband and his new family, Celeste is beautiful, thin, and rich, seems to have everything including the envy of other women, and incomer Jane become friends on a orientation day at their childrens' kindergarten at Pirriwee Public School, Its a world of competitive mums, gossip, smothered parenting, the past and secrets. An accusation of one child bullying another starts to draw the battlelines between the parents.However, once you start penetrating the surface, a number of dark issues emerge such as rape, bullying, domestic abuse and less than happy lives. And oh, yes, those big and little lies. Then there is murder and mystery at the school trivia night with the police interviewing parents. This is a story that I found myself drawn into and it even has a twist. It homes in on the divide between what is happening in the private personal sphere and the public face and gloss. A read that definitely captured my attention. I haven't seen the tv series yet but have heard many good things about it.

I read this... after I watched the Hulu miniseries. (Don't hit me.) But it was one of the best tv shows I've ever seen, leaving me sobbing for thirty minutes straight and completely, utterly shook. So I read the book version as quickly as possible, and what can I say? I really liked it. While I think the miniseries is at times a bit darker in vibe than the book, they're both just so, so excellent. This book does something rather brilliant: it begins in a everything-suburban-is-stable-facade, and then it destroys that facade, bit by careful bit. As the stories of Big Little Lies unfold, the layers of the characters are unraveled. Everyone has tragedies. Everyone has secrets. This is a very deep book hiding under a veneer of chick-lit and middle class drama. But I also liked that this story takes everything seriously. Conflicts about marriage. Conflicts about kids. Petty conflicts about kindergarten, even. These affect people\u2019s lives, even the lives of the stereotypical \u201cmothers\u201d. And so many innocent words can just be impossible to hear. I also thought the book built suspense quite well; the reminders of how much time remained until the trivia night were helpful, but the little statements from other parents on their opinions? Offer hints and suspense while also offering hilarity. A lot of the characters in this novel are somewhat despicable, and honestly, a little bit hateable. But they're still compelling because all of Morality's characters are highly motivated. Even when you may dislike a character, you must admit that their motives are sensical, and often even relatable. I also appreciated the grim reality with which it treated parental lives; the disdain that mothers face is utterly humanized. Tonally, this is one of the oddest books I've ever read. It goes from a grimly realistic painting of abuse to a humorous drama and then back again. But it always stays true to the characters, and that is where its power truly lies.

I\u2019d seen some good ratings for it and I liked the idea of a book set in Australia, somewhere I\u2019ve visited (briefly) but have hardly touched in a literary sense. And then it started weirdly, with a whole host of quotes from characters I hadn\u2019t yet been introduced to. Something about a trivia night at a school, some trouble kicked-off and somebody was hurt, or maybe even killed. It was losing me already and I\u2019d hardly started. One pet hate of mine is any book where there are too many names to remember\u2026 this was going to be a nightmare!I stayed with it a while and started to meet a few of the players. Ok, this was better. Some mothers with young children starting school in a beach suburb of Sydney, lots of chatter \u2013 some of it quite funny \u2013 but still no idea where it was all headed. And here we go again with the quotes, this time I recognised a couple of names and yes, someone had definitely died. All very strange.So here I\u2019ll give you a tip: if you reach this point and feel like giving up \u2013 don\u2019t! Now I was getting into the swing of it, it was quite comedic but with some darker overtones starting to creep in. I was also feeling more comfortable with the format: we\u2019d slipped back in time and were working our way towards the fateful night.From this point on I was dragged deeper and deeper into the intrigue. Who had been killed? Why? How? I was starting to build a number of scenarios in my head (all of them wrong, as it happens). The pace quickened and my engagement with the participants began to take on a personal feel \u2013 I was hoping some of them would get knocked off and fiercely wishing others would sort their lives out by fair means or foul.I really can't go into any detail regarding what transpired beyond this point other than to say it was all brilliantly entertaining and the telling of the tale was hugely original and, in my view, totally inspired. I loved it.If you liked Gone Girl or The Girl on the Train then you might appreciate this one too. It\u2019s light enough to be a beach read and gripping enough to stop you putting it down too often. Try a trip \u2018down under\u2019, I did and I wasn\u2019t disappointed."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine", "userReview": "I had Big Little Lies buried on my to-read list for over a year. I want to thank one of my lovely Goodreads friends Suzanne for suggesting I push it to the top of the mountain. Big Little Lies is a several-month slice of life in the universe of grade school parents in a coastal town located in Australia. Not having children, this setting fascinated me, especially since it was nothing like when I was a grade schooler in the late 1950s/1960s in Tennessee. Parents did not get into heavy politics and squabbles with each other and didn\u2018t hover over their kids back then. I\u2019m glad I was a kid when I was.Wow, this was some book! I went into it cold, not reviewing the plot blurb at all. The first quarter of the book mystified me; I had no idea where it was going. It seemed to drag a bit and to be rather chick-littish, but with quite a few 5 star reviews I elected to just go with it, and I\u2019m happy I did. The main thrust of the story revolves around the lead up to a melee resulting in significant injuries to several and death to one at the annual parents trivia night at the school. This is made known very early in the story; the rest of the book builds up to and includes that event and ends with an epilogue set one year later. One unique feature I loved was the snippets of police-parent interviews that took place right after the trivia night calamity; these appeared at the end or beginning of every chapter, starting with chapter 1. After I elected to just go with the story it actually flowed quickly. I had allotted 7 days to read this almost 500-page novel and finished in 4. There were many characters and many character-interactions to keep track of, but I found this not be a challenge for the most part. A huge plus for me was the author\u2019s numerous perfectly timed tiny bursts of humor that often had me laughing out loud. Ms. Moriarty and I clearly have the same sense of humor.So what are the themes of this novel? There were so many! The title refers to the seemingly little lies that people tell themselves, their friends and loved ones, their perceived enemies and the authorities that result in big, sometimes very big, consequences. The story also illustrates that people really don\u2019t always know their friends and loved ones as well as they might think. It touches on a myriad of other subjects such as bullying, domestic violence, sexual and emotional abuse, human trafficking and the impact of cliques and gossip. The power of friendship and just doing the right thing is well depicted. This book is polarizing. Some think it is boring and too long. Some believe it is mostly chick lit (let me just say this isn\u2019t a bad thing unless you hate chick lit), others think some of the characters are shallow (but there are people like this in real life). It has also been opined that some of the topics are handled inappropriately. Then there are those readers, like me, who loved it. I think it is cleverly written, contains just the right amount of humor and really has a lot to say at the end. I recommend everyone read this book for yourself and see what YOU think. I\u2019m glad I did, and I will definitely be reading more novels by Ms. Moriarty."}, {"userName": "AMEERA ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32325414-ameera", "userReview": "this book made me losing my mind all the time just i wanna know who doing this to Amabella and after all that this book just hit me in the face and said *surprise mother fuckers*"}, {"userName": "Laz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22313662-laz", "userReview": "Let's sum up this book with two words: \n\"Oh, calamity!\"\nWhat a pleasant surprise. When I picked this up I expected some sorts of a predictable, dull book about lies and family, etc. What I read though far exceeds those two. It's more of a family thriller. What does that mean? I just came up with it. It's about the horrors between families, the hardships. Not just the good stuff, leaving out all the bad. Mrs. Moriarty takes care to include everything in this book. From teenage nightmares to the undoubted horror of living next to your ex-husband. It all begins with a scream tearing through the night. And then we go back, 6 months back before that scream. We have moms, and dads, lots of them. A mom with three kids, two kids from her current marriage and one kid, a teenager, from her previous marriage (her ex-husband abandoned her and her child and then went on and remarried, had another child and moved next to them). We have a single mother. A mother with the perfect marriage, the perfect husband, the perfect children. But what if, I say, what if it's just all a big lie?Believe me when I say that you'll take immeasurable pleasure from reading this book. Gripping dialogues with touches of humor, black and white. Multi-dimensional characters, with lots of aspects to them. Characters who make mistakes, fall prey to others, and well, they're not perfect. Mrs. Moriarty is a master at portraying emotions in the simplest of ways, just one single word. The mystery surrounding the storyline is amazing and it makes you read more and more and before you know it, it's over. At the end of each chapter there are interviews from fellow Piriwee residents, giving statements and sharing their views of one another. Nothing more to say. Just read this. You have to.
