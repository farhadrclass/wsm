It was overwhelming and scary, but oh so very gripping too. Dark Matter is the kind of compelling \"I must know WTF is going on\" book that makes you forget about everything else you had to do that day. You step into this world - this absolute mind fuck of a world that will tug at both your heart strings and your brain cells - and you don't want to come out until you know how it ends. Real life? Who cares? Shit is going down and I need answers!I recently read Crouch's Pines and was pretty disappointed. It was a great concept, but I thought the TV show was better and I didn't much like any of the characters. That's not a problem here. Jason Dessen goes through some serious shit and it's hard not to find sympathy for him when his life is ripped apart.After being abducted one night by a masked man, Jason is knocked unconscious and wakes in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by unfamiliar people who all seem to think he's somebody he isn't. What happened to him? Where are his beloved wife and son? These are questions that he will try to answer. But, as he discovers more and more about his situation, he starts to doubt what is real and what is not. Doubt whether he'll ever make it back to his life. Doubt whether it ever even existed at all.\nI think, like you, like me, like everyone, she had regrets. I think sometimes she woke up in the night wondering if the path she took was the right one.\nAnd just when you think you got it. When you think you've wrapped your brain around where this book is taking you and what's going on - well, buckle your seat belts, because this ride is about to get a whole lot crazier. In a good way.It's mind-bending and exciting. I felt connected to the book on a personal level because I shared Jason's horror and the fear that he would never make it back to the family he loves. So it was emotionally engaging. But it was also thought-provoking. I could feel my eyes getting wider as I read further into the story.The sort of \"twist\" in the plot is the perfect kind. One of those that I really should have seen coming - it was so obvious! - and yet I didn't. At all. So so good.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Regan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19645927-regan", "userReview": "4.5This book f*cked me up."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Masterson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28953843-jennifer-masterson", "userReview": "LOVED IT!!! This book is insanity in a box! 5 stars! Believe the hype! Do not read many reviews! If you like sci fi or want something different and can suspend disbelief read or listen to this book!This is the audio version review! The audio narrated by actor, Jon Lindstrom, is as good as it gets! He was the perfect narrator for \"Dark Matter\". This man was born to narrate books! He's that good!\"Dark Matter\" starts out pretty simple and then very quickly it turns insane and just keeps getting crazier and crazier. When you think it can't get any crazier it does! Trust me! I will never look at a box the same way again! If there is a trigger warning for boxes this book should have it! Lol! Jason Desson is a physicist. He has been married to Daniela for years. He has a son, Charlie, who is almost 15 years old. He's generally a happy guy. He works at a college and loves his family. One day he goes to a bar. When he leaves the bar everything changes!

It just isn\u2019t the reason why this book is so highly praised. The author manages, however, to bring to life an authentic, loveable and heart-warming hero\u2026 or shall I say heroes?There is a lot going on in this story. Don\u2019t you worry, there\u2019s not just action. There\u2019s plenty of inspirational quotes and deep, emotional scenes and surprises.I can\u2019t give this book a five-star rating, because the writing isn\u2019t great exactly and it\u2019s simply not the type of book I would ever reread, but if I were to rate it on my enjoyment alone, my rating would be a four point five.When I said that Dark Matter is thought-provoking, I meant every syllable. There is no way to close this book and not ponder tiny, big things in your life. No way to not question some things or not smile at others.I won\u2019t summarize the story, because I read this having no prior knowledge of what it would contain, and the reading turned out amazing for me. Plus it\u2019s much more poignant this way. You won\u2019t see a thing coming. Even the ending is not what you\u2019ll expect at the beginning. But it\u2019s good.

Thomas/Luther Kite series and I knew I\u2019d found a new favorite author. I branched out on my own and decided to try the Wayward Pines series; somehow I ended up liking that even more than the previous. I was on a roll! Months ago, when I first saw your new book listed on NetGalley, it was vague and sneaky, both things I like in a book, but I decided to wait on requesting until I saw a couple of reviews. Then it hit me-everyone was describing this new book as a love story. A LOVE STORY?! No thanks; not for me. I don\u2019t do that mushy-gushy nonsense. I was disappointed; I had really hoped for something exciting and fresh! As time went on, more of my Goodreads buds kept giving me grief to the point I agreed to read it, but I put it off as long as possible until finally I just needed to clear it off my shelf. I was still a little bitter and possibly throwing a tantrum, but I was going to read it despite your utter betrayal into the land of touchy feely.Boy was I wrong. I know; I should have trusted you. And I finally get all those \u201cthis is truly a love story-blah blah blah\u201d comments, because at heart, it is just that. You made sure to include all the intelligent, thrilling components of a Blake Crouch masterpiece that made me almost cancel my date night because I had to read \u201cjust one more chapter\u201d. I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s bright idea it was to release your book during this Stranger Things phenomenon, but it was genius. My brain hasn\u2019t had to process this much science since college, and it\u2019s given me the illusion that I can moonlight as an intellectual again. Hehe. Anyway, no plot summary, giveaways, or spoilers here, but thank you good sir for putting in the time and effort to create an unforgettable journey that is sure to stay with all its readers for years to come. I appreciate you keeping it simple enough for my brain to keep up, and hopefully I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way. I\u2019ll be recommending this to everyone in the near future and am sure to include this in my Top Books of 2016 round up.Thanks again, and looking forward to the next book. I promise to be more trusting the next go around.All the best,ChelsP.S. I received my digital copy via NetGalley from Crown Publishing in exchange for an honest and fair review.

Until the ride comes to a complete stop. Thank you for choosing Dark Matter. We know you have choices when it comes to science fiction thriller books, and we thank you for choosing this one to entertain you today.The Martian.Harlan Coben, any of them.No more comparisons.I can see this being made into a movie.

Will I keep fighting to be the man I think I am? Or will I disown him and everything he loves, and step into the skin of the person this world would like for me to be?And if I have lost my mind, what then?What if everything I know is wrong?No. Stop.I am not losing my mind.\u201dThere is nothing more frustrating to a reviewer than reading a book that can\u2019t be written about. Almost every piece of information I could give you about this book is a ***spoiler***. Now, my definition of a spoiler and other people\u2019s definition of a spoiler are not always the same, but in the case of this book the less said, the better. I was very fortunate to watch the movie The Sixth Sense without having a clue about the plot, which is a minor miracle since I\u2019m highly exposed to plots of movies and books, but I was... over the moon... to watch that particular movie without knowing the twist of the plot. So with The Sixth Sense (That plot has nothing to do with this plot, just to be clear.) in mind, I am going to resist the urge to write and write and write about how cool this book is. The first order of business is to convince your friends to read it with you because you are going to want to discuss this book over numerous bottles of wine and a platter of cheese and pretzels. The cheese and pretzels only so you can drink more wine. It would be cruel and unusual punishment to have a designated driver, so my thought is that you should have this book discussion at someone\u2019s house and bring your PJs. Stay over and maybe, if you have the right reasonably attractive friends, you can have\u2026.\u201d...fumbling, groping, backset-of-the-car, unprotected because who-gives-a-fuck, protons-smashing-together sex.\u201d So keep that in mind, so that you don\u2019t get TOO DRUNK while discussing this book. Now, anyone familiar with Blake Crouch should know he is a twisty, a twizzler, a zigzagger, a trickster. He bamboozled me in Wayward Pines, and now he has gone even further with Dark Matter. The great thing about this TWIST is that it isn\u2019t just a one off twist...oh no...this is a twist that keeps wrapping itself around other twists until you start to feel little explosions in your head of all those overloaded brain cells. It\u2019s okay, you have plenty to spare. By the end of the book and certainly after the protons-smashing-together sex, you will be fully convinced that \u201c...we\u2019re a part of a much larger and stranger reality than we can possibly imagine.\u201d You will also be convinced that you need to read more Blake Crouch books, so you might as well go ahead and factor that into your book budget and *erhhh* food budget right now. \n\u201dWhat might have been and whathas beenPoint to one end, which is alwayspresent.Footfalls echo in the memoryDown the passage which we donot takeTowards the door we neverOpened.--T.

Dark Matter is best picked up with as little knowledge of the story as possible and its events explored with the same sense of vulnerable astonishment as the protagonist, Jason Dessen. The pacing and structure of this novel are brilliant. Events unfold in evermore enticing ways, and Crouch masterfully concludes each chapter in such a way that there's an urgent need to promptly being reading the next one. The unique sentence structure employed by Crouch further increases the sense of speediness and tension. There's no dawdling; everything is immediate. The warm autumn day is cloudless. Windless. Timeless. The air redolent of - Roasted peanuts. Popcorn. Plastic cups filled to the brim with beer. The wood is dry and gray, several seasons old, and it quickly takes the flame. Soon the walls of the living room are aglow. Shadows flickering across the ceiling. Though complex scientific theories are explored, they are presented in a comprehensive manner that makes them accessible to all readers. One needn't have a degree in physics or mathematics to fully appreciate the phenomena of Jason Dessen's mind-bending venture. We're all just wandering through the tundra of our existence, assigning value to worthlessness, when all that we love and hate, all we believe in and fight for and kill for and die for is as meaningless as images projected on Plexiglas. Dark Matter is a sensational technothriller that transcends the ordinary and escorts readers to an unexplored realm of infinite possibility. I've always known, on a purely intellectual level, that our separateness and isolation are an illusion. We're all made of the same thing - the blown-out pieces of matter formed in the fires of dead stars."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9684061-melissa", "userReview": "Wow.

It shook me to my core. \n\u201cAre you happy in your life?\u201d\nI\u2019m the first to admit, science-fiction isn\u2019t my thing. Not my go-to genre or even one I read with any type of consistency. In fact, it was seeing sci-fi in the blurb that initially made me run the other way. I couldn\u2019t ignore the sheer number of stellar reviews I kept seeing though and ultimately that\u2019s what piqued my curiosity enough to give it a go. I\u2019m so glad I did. I loved every single moment of Jason\u2019s story.Right out of the gate, it was a heart-pounding, on the edge of my seat, \u2018what is going on?\u2019 kind of story. Jason goes from having a quiet family night with his wife and 14 year-old son; to being abducted at gunpoint, stripped naked and taken to an abandoned warehouse. From there, an unexpected journey ensues. It\u2019s a race to find his way back home, to the life he wants and those he loves the most. Along the way, the author presents so many questions and quandaries about life. Things that will make you sit back and think. Not only about Jason\u2019s journey, but you might even find yourself examining your own life. If you had the chance to live as a different version of yourself, would you? This book is deep, so be prepared.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help thinking that we\u2019re more than the sum total of our choices, that all the paths we might have taken factor somehow into the math of our identity.\u201d\nJason was such an easy character to connect with. His sheer will and perseverance is what drew me to him the most. I loved that he never, not for one single moment, wavered on his decision and ultimately what he wanted.

Which in this instance and in this genre felt completely unexpected, to me.\n\u201cWhat would I be without you?\u201d\nMy one question - what happened to Amanda?

He steps out to meet with a long time friend, Ryan, who has been awarded a prestigious prize.

Scientific thinking comes into play, the quantum world, string theory and game theory. The mathematics of identity. If this novel was art, it would be a fusion of Surrealism, Cubism and Abstract Art. It is a rumination of all that a person could be, the many paths that could have been followed and decisions taken. Distilled to its essence, this is a story of one man's love for his family. What will he do to get back? Home is the love of Daniela and Charlie. What has to happen to ensure he has a future with them? They are the stars in his sky, they are everything. Wonderful novel.

However, I was pleasantly surprised when that scope expanded to include the whole multiverse exploration angle, and I thought those ideas were fun.Yet, I was again a little let down that the focus so entirely remained on Jason\u2019s desperate quest to get back to his family, and the guy started to irritate me a bit. He\u2019s seen disastrous consequences as a result of trying to find his wife, and it irked me that as a scientist he never seemed all that interested in any of the amazing things he was right in the middle of. His obsession to get home was incorporated into the story and dealt with in ways I appreciated, but this whole book was constant underlining how the only thing that this character cared about was his family. Which is understandable but felt one-note in a story with the potential to have epic scope.Yes, you could make the argument that was the whole point and that the sci-fi elements were just window dressing for a story about a man literally traveling multiple universes to get back to those he loves. But that runs squarely into a pet peeve of mine. A lot of mainstream fiction peddles the notion that we all have to make a choice between greatness/professional success versus having love/family. Since most of us are just average folks with average jobs but have people we care for in our lives it behooves the creators of these stories to reinforce the idea that we made the right choice, that we\u2019re better off than those who may seem to have it all because we\u2019re told they must surely be lonely and empty without the vital human connections that we have. In short, it\u2019s complete pandering nonsense that I have little patience for anymore. Sure, those who accomplish a lot make sacrifices, but all kinds of people who make their dreams a reality have family, friends, pets, etc. that they care for and spend time with. As an easy example: Follow Lin-Manuel Miranda on Twitter. Then try to tell me that someone can\u2019t have a spouse and child and still write and star in a groundbreaking Broadway play, win a Pulitzer Prize, deal with an insane amount of public attention, get involved in political and social causes, generally make the rest of us look like lazy slack-asses, and apparently have the time of his life while doing all of it.Ultimately I found this to be somewhat unsatisfying because its whole premise is built on that idea. It\u2019s telling that Jason never found a world where his doppelganger had both a successful career and the family. That world would have undercut the central idea that the average Jason, who cares only about his wife and son, was the \u2018best\u2019 one.

After his decision to meet one of his accomplished friends, who had won a prize on a scientific achievement, his life changes dramatically. During his mind-altering adventure he faces madness, danger, and choices that have to be made. But purely, he receives and realizes that \u201cthe Knowledge\u201d of our existence in the universe is both a burden and a blessing that can either improve or destroy our heathen, in so many ways, civilization. Our lives consist of simple truths that we accept without doubt. We live on a beautiful planet, we breathe, we fell in love, we make plans about our future, and we are told that we are unique. We rarely contemplate about the universe and the alternative realities that might or might not exist. In any case, are we to blame for our ignorance on topics that are our future? It is the human nature to avoid agonizing about things that are beyond our control. But then, you read an article or a book that stimulates you to wonder, to doubt, and to explore ideas and thoughts that are astonishing, intimidating, mind-blowing and insane. And then comes this moment when you think:\n\n\u201cWhat if people knew what I know?\u201d\n\nAlternative universes, alternatives realities, a better or worse or a completely deferent version of yourself, and the choices that make you \u201cyou\u201d, are the main topics that Blake Crouch is attempting to elaborate in his book \u201cDark Matter\u201d. I ought to confess that Blake managed to play a severe game with my mind as I\u2019ve got to the point considering about my sanity, after losing myself into the story, the infinite of the universe and the \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. All in all, it was a mind blender.Blake pictures a vivid world, which is action-packed, addictive, adventurous, complex and awe-inspiring. His short sentences are like gun shots- this short, this fatal. Using a simple writing-style he \u201cshoots\u201d you with information and a dazzling world where he is the God and the Death himself. He proves that he is a mile away of a pusillanimous writer, by intervening in a field of the multiverse, which seems such a hallucinatory attempt that even some scientists are afraid to consider. However, after all, this is the beauty of being a writer. You can write on crazy, overwhelming topics and stimulate the readers to study things that they didn\u2019t imagine they would be interested in.Being said that,\n\n\u201cAll your life, you\u2019re told you\u2019re unique. An individual. That no one on the planet is just like you.It\u2019s humanity anthem.But that isn\u2019t for me anymore.\u201d\n\nIt truly isn\u2019t. Crouch accomplished to engage me in a way so deep, where I was able to absorb and imagine the unimaginable truths of our existence and made me sing along with \u201cSleeping At Last\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHow rare and beautiful it truly is that we exist\u201d\n\n\n\nI would like to dedicate this review to one of the greatest minds of our days who recently passed away,to Stephen William Hawking. A theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author, who bequeathed us a great knowledge on the universe and black holes. Stephen Hawking was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation and I am convinced that he will continue to be an inspiration for many generations to think outside the box and explore the inexplicable and unimaginable wonders of the universe."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "I was hooked right away. Exciting -page turner- extremely fast pacing as rumors have spread. The author has a unique style of writing- very short sentences. \"SHOTS OF ADRENALINE\"!!!He also creates clear images from the start -- visuals of family life....[Thurs. night is family night with Jason, Daniela, and their son Charlie]. The dialogue is intimate - but at times the narration felt laborious - however the author draws us in anyway. I liked this story... It's almost impossible to put it down -as others have said. But I was left with questions - 'why and how' questions. So....FOR PEOPLE WHO 'HAVE' read this book....I have questions: But NO SPOILERS --so if other 'book-lovers' are reading this - my questions won't give anything away.What did you think about Amanda? And am I the only one who wanted to see more developed in her character? Other thoughts about......? [YOU KNOW]Also...did anyone else feel sad for Daniela? I tried to imagine being in her shoes...Daniela was strong and always held her own--almost a saint at times--but I still felt sorry for her. In \"Dark Matter\", Blake Crouch doesn't just build a world...he explores various incidences of the multiverse. Parts of these worlds were MIND BLOWING-COMPELLING!!! TWISTY THINKING!!Our imaginations are being stretched like an old stretched rubber band. Once over-stretched - there is no way to ever find its way back to its original shape.

A buddy and I were talking about him last night, it feels like HE isn't even sure where the story is going. But you better hang on because it's always a bumpy ride.\nThis one starts out just like a normal book. (I'm not spoiling for this part) Jason Dessen is just an average guy. He is married to his long time love, has a teenage son, isn't really rich, his life would be classified more around average. Then he gets taken at gunpoint and taken to an abandoned warehouse and injected with a drug. When he wakes up his whole life has changed...and it's some freaky stuff.\nI don't know how much of the sciencey stuff is correct, but who cares?

Even though it's been a few hours since I finished reading it, I genuinely cannot stop thinking about it. This book was bonkers! SO good! Sci-fi was never a genre I gravitated towards, but now I want to read them all!This book poses the question of \u201cAre you happy in your life?\u201d, after the main character is abducted one night. It's a question the kidnapper poses to him, which leads to them 'swapping lives'. The plot is centred around the initial question posed and takes off from there. It's definitely best to go into it knowing as little as possible. The concept and approach of the storyline was just ingenious. It completely blurs the line of what's real, or what we perceive to be the reality that has been fixed and known to the world for eons, and the possibility that there are 'other worlds' out there, other versions of ourselves, living the life that we perhaps intended or that steered in a direction we weren't anticipating. For a thriller novel, it's quite philosophical and I love that, calling the readers into question, making it engaging and to decipher what we want from this life and what's important to us. It was exciting, exhilarating and extremely thought-provoking. Since I highly doubt we'll be experiencing the journey this character went on, it was still extremely engaging. You pause. Have a moment. Think about the choices you've made in your life. You're taken on a whirlwind that doesn't stop and keeps on getting crazier. Has you gaping. Mouth open. WTF. Deceives you into thinking that things will start getting back to normal again, till the author decides to surprise you and mess with your mind again. And on it goes. Highly recommend it if the concept sounds interesting to you. Even if you're not into sci-fi, this will probably make you love it. Or at least spark a huge interest."}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "well.never have i ever read a book like that before. & it worked out like a dream!!!review to come-------currently reading updateI DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT I'M INTO IT."}, {"userName": "Petrik", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59458347-petrik", "userReview": "4.5/5 Stars(My last review of 2016 and I\u2019m really glad it\u2019s this book that I chose. Thank you very much to one of my GR best friend Mary for recommending this book to me.)\n\u201cAre you happy with your life?\u201d\nSingle question that you\u2019ve probably wondered or been asked several times throughout your life. How far will you go to save the one you love? Do you ever have any regrets in your life and wondered what would happen if you didn\u2019t make that mistake?Obviously we all have regrets, we lose someone, we regret some of the choices we make, and we thought something like \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that\u201d, \u201cI should\u2019ve done the other option\u201d and a tons other similar questions that came up in our head. These questions is why Dark Matter is a book suitable for everyone and in my opinion a must read whether you like the genre or not.\n\u201cFor anyone who has wondered what their life might look like at the end of the road not taken.\u201d\nThis phrase basically summed up all human and why I think everyone should give this book a chance.I won\u2019t even talk about the plot in this book, nope, anything I said could be a bit spoilery cause everything that happened in the plot literally starts from the beginning and the pace goes as fast as a roller-coaster until the end. I strongly encourage you to jump into this book blindly, don\u2019t look at the blurb, don\u2019t even read this review if you want. I will say this though, this book is a really fantastic Sci-Fi thriller, it's unique and it gripped you from the beginning and it doesn\u2019t let go until the last page. The writings and format are really easy to follow and plus the intensity of the plot makes this book a really amazing page turner.The only minor problem I have with the book is I thought the ending is a bit too \u2018Hollywood\u2019 for me. (Sony lined up to the right for a movie adaptation of this book even when the book weren\u2019t out yet back in 2014, only from a 150 pages manuscript so that could be the reason for the ending.)Sci-Fi has always been one of my favorite genres of all time but until now I\u2019ve never encountered a great sci-fi book despite how many great movies, anime or video games I experienced in the genre. That changed today after I finished this book. Not only it\u2019s great for the reasons I mentioned above, the book also deals deeply with the theme of love, sacrifices, family, regret and choices.\n\u201cLife doesn\u2019t work that way. You live with your choices and learn.\u201d\nI\u2019ll close my review here and I\u2019ll be walking into 2017 with the lesson I learned from this book that I\u2019ve always known and yet can\u2019t help but forget sometimes. To not look back, no more regrets, every choices I ever made or will make is mine, bad or good I\u2019ll live and make the best out of it. No more taking things for granted and I hope you'll be able too.

After being injected with something, Jason wakes up and his world has been turned upside down...As I mentioned in the past, I tend to resist books with any amount of hype attached. I even passed on this when it initially came up on Netgalley. However, the gang at Goodreads made me change my mind. So, yeah, the gang was right. Every once in a while, a book feels like it was written with my admittedly peculiar tastes in mind. This is one of those books that caught lightning in a bottle.As with reads like The Man from Primrose Lane and The Great Forgetting, I'm going to keep this as vague as possible to retard spoilage. Dark Matter is a thriller with a science fiction bend. The What-the-fuckery level is quite high and I wolfed it down in two sittings. It's so damn readable I want to punch Blake Crouch in the junk.Jason Dessen made for a great lead, a scientist with a loving family and a life he wasn't that enthused about. When he wakes up in another life, he quickly finds himself driving up diarrhea drive on four flat tires.Since this wasn't my first ride on the weirdness wagon, I tipped to who the masked man was before the big reveal. However, I had no idea the magnitude of the mind fuck headed my way. I pretty much cleared my calendar to wolf down everything after the first 24%. It was that damn gripping.The ending was great. I kind of guessed how things would go but Crouch hit the ball out of the park.I don't really know what else I can say without spoiling things.

It was mostly a science fiction novel with a little bit of romance and some suspense to make it a most enjoyable read. All three of those components is what I really liked about this novel. I was hooked from the very first chapter!While the story started out really strong for me there were some portions of this novel that I just didn't get and it was a little hard to follow the mechanics of it all. I think that if there was less of the scientific background (although there wasn't really all that much) that was introduced to us it would have gotten a full 5* review from me. I don't need everything broke down or analyzed for me, it is fiction so I just go with it! But, it was filled with non-stop action and had a very dramatic storyline to make it quite the page-turner and I couldn't stop thinking about it.

On the surface, this is a sci-fi thriller which is generally not my bag. Buuuuuuuut since it was a Crouch story I rolled the dice. My reaction? Holy shitsnacks.

It\u2019s up to Jason to piece the puzzle back together and discover what is real and what is really just a result of the box . . . .\nTalk about a story that went from 0 to 60 in 1.7 seconds. One of the things I love most about Crouch is that he doesn\u2019t waste time. You jump feet first in to the action and he never lets you slow down. There is no lag in the story, no filler, no time to catch your breath. My poor little heart was beating like a rabbit! And to top it all off, not only was this a speed-of-light thrillride, but it was also the most amazing story about true love. Not instalove. Not saw a stranger across a crowded room \u201clove,\u201d but the ugly, married for ages, elbow deep in babyshit, questioning if you made the right choices or effed your whole life away but god yes I would do it all over again, rip your heart out if you lost her kind of love.Congratulations, Mr. Crouch.

I did not like Interstellar.I found the plot to be intriguing, but not particularly original. It felt like a rehashing of many stories. The themes were pretty much exactly what you'd expect to find in a book about multiple universes: life, love, decisions, fate, acceptance, etc. And the dialogue was mediocre at best. There were some lines that had me laughing out loud...and they weren't supposed to be funny. \"It felt like it was the first time you had really seen me. Maybe the first time anyone had ever really seen me. It was the hottest thing.\" THE HOTTEST THING? Also: \"It was like I was something, not that you wanted, but that you needed.

There is\u2026 how do I put it? There is a sense of despair that shows up from the first few pages and never lets go, up until the very end. With every chapter you keep on hoping Jason, the main character, will make it and with every chapter you receive another blow. It reminds me of this little movie I\u2019ve seen a while ago. It is called Scenic Route and I highly recommend it for anyone loving psychological dramas. In this movie there are these two friends that get stuck in the middle of a desert. They hope to get rescued, and if the fate wasn\u2019t that cruel, they would have been. Instead, they miss chance after chance, without even realizing it. But you, as a viewer, see it. And with every chance that slips away you get more anxious. It plays with your mind, just like this book does!So the idea behind Dark Matter is that this guy, Jason Dessen, gets kidnapped. He wakes up in a world that is just like his, only it isn\u2019t. In this world he doesn\u2019t have a family anymore, because he abandoned that path a long time ago. Instead, he is a successful science personality, something that could have happened in his own world, if he decided to give up on his family. The whole book is based on that old saying: Be careful what you wish for. Or enjoy what you have while it lasts. Now, this is an almost perfect book.
