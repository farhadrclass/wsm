I found Poison Study to be an amazing book, with an engaging plot, real, intriguing characters and excellent writing. Magic Study begins much the same, until around page 240, and then it takes a nose dive through crazy town. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. For a book that began with a five star rating, Snyder had to work to make this book as nonsensical as it ended up being. Here are a few of my qualms.Yelena, once resourceful, intelligent, honorable, yet a little self effacing becomes an arrogant Mary Sue cutout, who rushes into trouble even when she knows her actions are idiotic because stupid though she may be, and despite her lack of knowledge about magic, naturally, she knows better than everyone else. Even more ridiculous is her anger towards her brother. I would completely understand her anger if it were due to his treatment of her now that they are both adults, he certainly isn\u2019t kind, or for the fact that he never told their parents that Yelena had been kidnapped, but as it were, she is angry with him because he didn\u2019t try to save her when she was taken, as if an 8 year old boy could pose any type of threat to a master magician and his minions. Give me a break.Valek. Oh how I loved him, in Poison Study, his and Yelena\u2019s partnership was a delight to read. There were well matched, respectful of one another and had a brilliant chemistry and understanding. I was so excited to see how their relationship would progress. I\u2019m still waiting. Valek, once a cunning advisor/assassin, is now reduced to stud stand in who takes order from Yelena. How this mentor became the one being dictated to is beyond me and completely un-interesting to read. Grating is more like it. He even gets captured a few times, which is very un-Valek like.Yelena\u2019s family\u2026What exactly is Leif\u2019s, Yelena\u2019s brother, problem? Snyder tries to explain it via Moon Man, the Story Weaver (don\u2019t get me started) but it was ridiculous. Who gets kidnapped on purpose? And what mental disorder does Perl, Yelena\u2019s mother, have? While she is clearly a crafty little tree climber, I have a hard time believing she is \u201cformidable\u201d when all she does is make perfume and cower in plants.The plot, oh where do I start? I\u2019ve lost track of how many times Yelena gets kidnapped. It was pointless and un-necessary. The characters of Goel and Alea served no purpose other than to act as filler. The rest is too bizarre to comment on.The bad guy. Last time I checked not all bad guys\u2019 rape and torture, yet every bad guy in Snyder\u2019s books do. Very annoying. However, that perfume pump used to defeat Ferde (bad guy) was amusing, but daft. Why not just use one of those ingenious little darts like everyone else. Instead, Yelena storms in with armed with a squirt bottle, lol.So these are just a few of my issues, there are plenty more, but I can\u2019t bring myself to mention them. If you are reading Magic Study because you adored Poison Study, please be warned. This book pales in comparison and will ruin your view of the characters you love."}, {"userName": "\u2744\ufe0fNani\u2744\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68538597-nani", "userReview": "4.5\u2b50\ufe0fI hoped I\u2019d love this book but I'm truly surprised at how engrossed and utterly into the story I was. The characters satisfied me to no end, the plot kept me engaged but more importantly, I loved and respected the way Maria V. Snyder handled sexual violence in the story. I was so close to giving this the full rating for that alone and in fact, would have, had it not been for one thing that, in hindsight, might seem minor but it was enough to genuinely irk me as it was one of my biggest peeves in books. More on that later\u2026Magic Study\u00a0picks up a few weeks after\u00a0Poison Study\u00a0ends and we continue the journey with Yelena going off to Sitia with Irys to be reintroduced to her family and improve her magical abilities in the process. As Yelena continues her trials of fitting in, she is taken to study magic with the Four Magicians. In her studies, she learns that rules are set but adhering to them is a different story.In comparison to Poison Study, which I also loved, this one is much more complicated with countless subplots that emerge but never feel long-winded or overwrought in any way, even when combining new world-building elements. The world grows bigger but Yelena\u2019s character development is by no means neglected. Everything is carefully written and as the world grows subtly, Yelena\u2019s own inner struggles with her emerging powers and the implications of these powers are also deftly developed. Aside from certain problems, problems I'll in no way forgive however much I loved the book, I thoroughly enjoyed it down to the last age. One thing that really struck me and that I applaud Maria V. Snyder was how maturely and sensitively she dealt with the complexities and darkness of sexual violence. We\u2019ve seen many times where rape becomes just another lazy plot device that overlooks the trauma of the victim and instead focuses on just moving the plot forward, in an unconscionably stoic way, that completely derides the pain, the trauma of that person\u2019s abusive past. Magic Study\u00a0does something that is truly hard to accomplish in the sense that it deals with this issue in a way that shows the author is not just throwing these things in haphazardly for dramatic effect but utilizes it to show the real issues that are present in the lives of not just women, but men, and how this type of violence can severely damage a person\u2019s self-identity.Snyder shows the realistic tumultuous toll it has on a person\u2019s psyche, but she also shows what we, as a society, should be doing in reaction to facing the reality that sexual violence exists in our society, and we need to give as much care, compassion, and above all, empowering messages to any and all that have faced this ineffably painful experience in their lives.Now to what got under my skin:I love Yelena as a MC. She\u2019s unlike many YA protagonist in the sense that she\u2019s incredibly mature especially considering all that she\u2019s had to endure. She never whines or complains about her fate but takes charge where she can and deals with it the best way she can. It was all going so smoothly until Snyder did the one thing that irritates me to no end.Making Yelena incredibly, almost unbecomingly and dangerously impulsive:Snap judgments, quick decisions, charging full-speed ahead without thinking beyond the now was one of her biggest and not-so-charming weaknesses.Her callousness and always diving headfirst into whatever bad situation with no thought to how her rash decisions impacted those around her, especially when the stakes are so high, i.e. the fate of Sitia and its people was something I could have truly done without.Every time something went wrong, there goes Yelena to the rescue! EVERY SINGLE TIME! I hated it. Why would she think she\u2019d be able to accomplish things that even the most powerful, Four Magicians couldn\u2019t!? And of course, who needs plan B? Because an overconfident Yelena never seems the need for backup plans. Some minor spoilers ahead ****PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!****But here\u2019s my biggest and absolute I\u2019m-this-close-to-punching-someone peeve:When a character suddenly and out of nowhere becomes a master at everything. *breathes calmly*\u2917 Here\u2019s Yelena, living her life blissfully ignorant of the fact that she has some types magical abilities...\u2917 Voila, she finds out she comes from a long line of magical type families or what have you. Fantastic, still alright so far.\u2917 A few week pass by and she hasn\u2019t mastered her magic yet so she goes off to Sitia to discover more. Almost there...\u2917 Then BAM! Not even six months and she can do all sorts of magical shit that those who\u2019ve spent their entire lives mastering at it can\u2019t even do! Just hold on now...\u2917 The madness does not stop there. No, not only can she do the impossible, she also happens to have some long-lost magic that\u2019s been lost for centuries! *breathing* *breathing*\u2917 Oh, you thought that was it?\u2026cute. Forget the mysterious long-lost magic, our dearest Yelena also gets an offer to become, wait for it, a master magician! *shakes head*\u2917 That's right, there are only FOUR master magicians throughout Sitia\u2019s time, all of whom have worked at their abilities almost their entire life, but of course, Yelena just strolls in, a magician for less than six months, and gets an offer to become a Four Magician because, hey, why not. She's a soulcaster, a soulfinder, why not throw in a Four Magician as well? WHY did this have to be part the story?? Why couldn\u2019t she have grown at a study pace and slowly rise to the top? It is, after all, called Magic STUDY. Not Magic Mastery. Let her study the damn magic, for heaven's sake.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Why even call it that when there was barely studying and more mastering out of thin air?

However, right about page 300 to 400 something went wrong with this book. I felt that Yelena had just one too many defying authority/escape from the Keep/kidnapping by a criminal/torture scene/escape using magical powers actions repeated over an over again. There were simply too many repetitions of the same scenarios for one story. In that respect Alea's story line should have been omitted altogether. Action is important, but not at the expense of the structure of the book. And as the amount of action increased, the quality of the writing suffered - the book took a very juvenile tone IMO. Another aspect I didn't like - Valek's role in the book. For one, he was absent until about page 275 and when he finally appeared, most of the time his only purpose was to provide stud services for Yelena (no graphic details here to my chagrin). Where were the partnership between the two, the teamwork? And finally my last complaint - the writer needs to come up with some other type of villain - a torture-loving/raping magician scenario is simply getting old.I was so irritated by these issues that I was about to give the book 2 stars, but somehow the last chapter pulled the story together and left me feeling satisfied. In the end, I did enjoy the book for the most part, in spite of many flaws, but unfortunately my expectations for the next book in the trilogy \"Fire Study\" and for the writer in general definitely diminished."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51318038-maggie", "userReview": "\u275dEvery decision, every interaction, every step, every time you get out of bed in the morning, you take a risk. To survive is to know you're taking that risk and to not get out of bed clutching illusions of safety.\u275e\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bdI still have a love for Yelena. My love for her just grows because of how strong she is becoming and how much of a better heroine she is willing to make herself. I don't think I've ever loved a female protagonist so much. She keeps everything so balanced. The only thing I wanted was for her to make some changes in her plans. Instead of her making them, they were made by themselves._________________________________After being a food taster and being trained to be one for the Commander of Ixia, Yelena has discovered she has magic abilities. Because of this magic she has found out about herself, she must return home and meet her family to see what they are able to do. But even though Yelena knows her position in being the foot taster for poisons, she misses it. She doesn't like being with her relatives that don't fully recognize her and even accept her, but rather she misses being home in Ixia with the man she discovered she has fallen for, her friends who were able to give her some basic training, and the background she grew accustomed to.But even though Yelena doesn't care much about her relatives and people she grew up with accepting her for the person who reeks of blood and has killed and been training. All she knows is she's ready to start magic training. She's been given the choice as she did when she was about to be executed: Grow her power or be put to death. But when Yelena decides to make plans for her trip and see how she can grow stronger and become a better person, they decide to take a turn and she becomes the problem of the lost Ixia prince. Even though she has made enemies, Yelena doesn't give up in learning these new abilities she has been told about. Even if it means taking them down herself. But Yelena knows she's got help from her old friends._________________________________All I really wanted were Valek and Yelena moments. What is their ship name?- Velena?- Yalek?- Valena?I just wanted those ship names to keep floating on the ocean. I wanted Valek to call her my love a lot more times then he really did, I wanted them to kick ass together, I wanted them to surpass anyone that got in their way, I wanted them to go home and have their moments together, hell, I wanted them to go to the room and have one of those moments together! Shit am I a pervert?? Well I'm sorry I blame Maria for introducing me to these two and loving them both together and by together I mean them being together. Since Valek confessed to Yelena in Poison Study and admitted she has poisoned him, I was so happy and I squealed because all I had been waiting for is for them to admit their love and kiss. I also wanted Janco and Ari to grow a better friendship with Yelena and for Irys to join the \"squad.\"Although Magic Study was so different than Poison Study, there were some things I did like about it and I guess had me hooked on them. But even when I was hoping many other things, I got a few of them. I'm not giving up on the series! Even if the books either fade with the rave or everything just gets better as the series continues, or well, continues for me, I will keep reading it. Yes, I live for Valek and Yelena. But I'm here for Maria's writing and for her beautiful Chronicles of Ixia series. I just want more Janco, Ari, and Velena moments. Please don't kill me I don't know what their ship name is.The writing in this novel was better, I will admit. Of course, Maria's writing just continued to improve every year and every time she would be writing/typing. It makes me upset how I loved Poison Study so much and I was so excited to get my hands on Magic Study and see what adventure Yelena would have, but then I regret all the excitement. Yelena didn't have a fun adventure. Well, not like the one in Poison Study. In this novel, she was rather not fully accepted by her family and there were assumptions, concerns and feelings about her not being a Zaltana. But after she proved herself that she is the \"lost child of Ixia\" and Yelena Zaltana, she was able to prove herself worthy of her care and her magic and abilities as well. Yelena grew stronger, and I loved that about her! She was able to keep others out of her mind and control her power even when at the same time, she was still learning. Again, Maria did an amazing job on that! Maria is one of those authors where she keeps the characters balanced. They are learning something while keeping their abilities balanced without messing up and ruining everything. Yelena was still the strong heroine and she was only growing stronger!Like I said before, I was upset how there weren't many moments of Valek, Janco and Ari. I literally fell in love with all 3 since the beginning. Valek is still that loyal guard of the Commander and Janco and Ari are still those 2 friends that are able to make fun of Yelena and embarrass her in a small and quick way.Maybe things will change in Fire Study and developments will be made. I'm gonna continue with the series. I've been captivated by it since I first read the blurb. I always heard wonderful reviews about it and how it's all such a wonderful series that doesn't include plot ruiners, character annoyance, and/or love triangles. Hopefully all of that is true. Hopefully Yelena doesn't become weak and spoiled. Hopefully there are no characters that grow a hatred from me. And hopefully, I am just praying, that the love interest doesn't change and Yelena doesn't back up from Valek, only deciding to go with some other guy. Or the other way around. Hopefully Valek doesn't turn into a lying asshole. Hopefully Janco and Ari don't end up annoying me and ruining their friendship with Yelena. And hopefully Valek doesn't decide to leave Yelena for \"someone better.\""}, {"userName": "Simona Bartolotta", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5312173-simona-bartolotta", "userReview": "Uh-uh.

But the writing is a bit dry and the plot felt kind of recycled here... like once again there is a magician raping & killing young women. And that's just not particularly something I want to read about in the first place. Yelena returns to her childhood home after dropping off the rest of the missing girls from the first book. She spends a few chapters trying to become reacquainted with her family. Her brother last saw her when she was 6, but still says \n\"My sister would be reveling in her freedom, and wrapped with hatred for her captors. You have lost your soul to the north. You are not my sister. It would have been better if you had died than returned to us tainted.\"\nMeanwhile someone is systematically abducting, raping/torturing, and killing 15-16 year old unmarried girls. Yelena spends a lot of the story training and/or trying to find the killer. While training, she learns she's able to control other people's bodies, read minds (and communicate with her horse, which was odd), and might even be powerful enough to wake the dead. So there was a hint of super special snowflake magic and a love triangle with a royal guy, but the plot didn't rely on any of that too heavily. I was excited when Ari, Janco, and Valek finally showed up again in the last 1/3, but then Valek didn't do much except sleep with Yelena. The last part of the book sort of fell apart as it went through the same sort of situations that filled the rest of the story... Yelena escaped more terrible scenarios yet again. The end. The events were intense and there was potential for an engaging, fast-paced plot! But the writing stayed pretty dull the whole way through no matter what was happening. I'll still read the sequel because I like this world, but hopefully it's more interesting and there's some other conflict besides all of the repeated violence against women."}, {"userName": "Lyndsey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4224396-lyndsey", "userReview": "Considering how often Yelena was injured, captured, and beat-to-a-pulp in this follow-up to Poison Study - I felt this picture summed it up best:There are considerably more DOH! moments in this book, as opposed to the zero in the last book. Quite a few times, I felt myself wanting to smack some sense into Yelena. Especially toward the beginning of the book, she didn't seem to be her reliable calculating and resourceful old self.Instead of reading, like I did with Poison Study, I listened to the audiobook for Magic Study. The narrator was good, although not the best. She had great inflections and tone to her voice and never became tiresome.However, I found her choice of individual voices a great source of amusement. Some males had a distinct femininity and some females sounded much too masculine. There wasn't always consistency with accents as well.Two of the side characters, Bain and Reyad had what sounded like a mix of Irish and Scottish accents with Bain sounding much too feminine. I actually thought he was a woman for quite a while. Valek, Yelena's love interest, had a slight female sounding voice as well with a mix of a British and Australian accent. Cahil, Yelena's frenemy, came off as a surfer-slash-stoner. The student Gelsie sounded just like the horse Kiki. That's right. A talking horse!! (who I love!) But it's not what you might think. She's no Mister Ed. And Irys, Yelena's mentor - Well, she had about as feminine a voice as Al Green. Like a Russian body building Cher (now that's a mental image). Ari and Janco, however, sounded exactly how I felt they should. In fact, it made me want to listen to Poison Study just to hear some of their hilarious exchanges.The voices also got me thinking about how the narrator decides who gets what voice. Do they consult with the author or just make it up as they go? Do they even read the book first? If memory serves me right, it seems like she started out pronouncing Dax as Dox, then switched halfway through the book. Was she corrected or had she just forgotten how she pronounced his name before?In this book, Yelena refers to her tactics against her foes as her \"rush into a situation and hope for the best\" method, but I don't think she gives herself enough credit. As her relationships with various new characters progress, she takes on a new role. Team member. Often, she at least seems to be thinking ahead but mostly she relies heavily on others, as opposed to her old self, who trusted and counted on no one. This doesn't come off as a strength or a weakness, she just tends to find herself in need of help more often. All of that is an inevitability with the expanding cast of characters and friends.Valek wasn't in this book nearly as much. I felt their relationship went from \"summer lovin\" to \"you're the that I want\" a little too fast. In the Poison Study, their relationship developed slowly. It seemed they were a little too connected in this one. A little more than I believed, at least since it's common knowledge that he would easily kill her if asked to by his Commander. \"Oh my love, you're the only one for me. Now come closer, so I can slit your throat because I was commanded to.\" I didn't get that part of it.I really wished the storyline with Ferda had been completely wrapped up. I was looking forward to a new big bad in Fire Study, because this guy creeps me out. That's the mark a good villain, though.Overall, Maria's prose is lovely. No out of place descriptions or metaphors this time. The character development was decent and mostly believable. This one just didn't draw me in the way the first one did. I felt a lot of disconnect. I am still looking forward to the next, mainly in hopes of more Ari and Janco time!My review for the first book: Poison StudyMy review for the third book: Fire Study"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40997852-nicole", "userReview": "I loved the first half, same vibes of Poison Study. Yelena was discovering her magic and starting a new life in Sitia. She meets some great (and bad) people there. The first part of the second half and all the events with Ferde weren't so impressive, though. It got slightly better with the Ixians arrival and the last chapter was promising. I think my main problem was with the villain, a different sort of villain would've been appreciated since this one was similar to Ryad (sadist and rapist and like in Poison Study both want the magic of some people). I wanted to see her connect with her family more, a deep relationship not just spare them the pain of the my horrors and the nice parents. I wanted more complexity. Leif is another story, can't say anything about him to avoid spoilers but even with the end, I still don't like him. I HATE CAHIL. Overall I enjoyed this book, while I wasn't disappointed, i wasn't wowed either. Poison Study is better true, but this book is still worth it. I lowered my expectations because of the negative reviews, they have a point but I love the characters too much: Yelena, Valek, Ari, Janco, Irys, and Kiki are my favorites.

Oh man, how I wish I could rate this book differently. I had such high hopes for the second book in the Study-series: \"Poison Study\u201d absolutely kicked ass and was a great mix of political scheming, romance, and magical powers with an awesome MC to rule it all. The only problem that I had was that Maria Snyder lost control around 2/3 of the book, which I hoped wouldn\u2019t happen again\u2026But it did. And boy, did that fuck up the second half of this book. \u201cLiving is a risk,' I snapped at him. 'Every decision, every interaction, every step, every time you get out of bed in the morning, you take a risk. To survive is to know you're taking that risk and to not get out of bed clutching illusions of safety.\u201d Yes, the stakes are definitely higher this time. Where Yelena only had to deal with political enemies and evil magicians in the first book, things get a lot more personal in this book. In Magic Study Yelena travels to Sitia where she\u2019ll start her magical training and finally meet her family. That doesn\u2019t go without a problem, especially since Valek isn\u2019t there to support her, and things get even more complicated when a rogue, murderous Magician appears who sets his eyes on Yelena. So more than enough people and events to write an action-filled, fast-paced story, and that\u2019s exactly that Snyder did. Where the writing-style in Book 1 echoed the calm precision of Ixia\u2019s military control, book 2 is written very different. Battles, meetings of new characters, and magic lessons come quickly one after another, without us rarely getting time to breath and take it all in. However every bit of information that we got in the first half of the book was fascinating, so the tempo didn\u2019t bother me. The land of Sitia was enchanting to discover alongside Yelena, just as it was interesting to learn about the different types of magic (abilities). As for the new characters: Leif pissed me off at first, but I kept feeling that there was more to him. Cahill reminded me of Joffrey \u2013 a na\u00efve, spoiled boy who has too much power - and I liked the mentor/teacher-relationship between Irys and Yelena. And Kiki and Topaz were lovely to meet too (they were no Janco and Ari, but still :) What wasn\u2019t lovely was that the fast pace made Yelena\u2019s magical training seem like joke. Training, who needs that? Yelena could do everything at the first try! Talk to animals, mind/body-control bad guys (which makes it okay, I guess? Not really), even heal badly injured people: whatever Yelena set her magic to happens without a hitch. It was such a painful contrast with \"Poison Study\" where Yelena really got the time to learn new skills and master them; it made her such a great MC.Now everything that I previously liked about her \u2013 her bravery, her intelligence, her respect for her teachers \u2013 disappeared to the background because Snyder needed Yelena to be active ALL THE TIME. She was still a nice person, and I liked how she helped Tula through her trauma, but I really feel that Snyder should\u2019ve treated her better.But the reason why we don\u2019t have time to patiently study is because Snyder really kicks the tempo up a notch when the second half of the book starts. The reader and Yelena just jump from one (action-)scene to the next one without a logical flow: -\tBAM! To the capital to look for Ferde with the help of the young beggars, instead of, you know, the Four Master Magicians who apparently aren\u2019t that powerful. -\tBAM! Time to make out with Valek, who only appears after 70% of the story is done and does nothing but kiss and fight for Yelena when she needs him. (Come on Snyder, the man deserves better than that!)-\tBAM! A random kidnapping which is completely pointless for the plot.-\tBAM! Back to hunting Ferde with the help of Yelena\u2019s parents, who only are useful when the plot needs them to be. BAM! BAM! BAM! - And then suddenly Snyder remembered that she needed to end some plot lines before the book is over, so she quickly does this without taking care of her own plot. This way the fast tempo doesn't only kill the storylines, but also the magic study itself, Yelena's character, and the danger and romance which made the first book so great. Therefore I can only give this book 2,5 stars, and despite the promising start, take down to 2 stars in the end. But beside that Snyder damaged her second book pretty bad, she also burned up my joy of looking forward to \"Fire Study\". I\u2019ll be reading it of course, but not with the same enthusiasm as I started Magic Study. The blurb tells me that there\u2019ll be plenty of action to go around, so I hope that Snyder treats Yelena, Valek, and the plot with more respect and patience.

The unique sense of danger was gone, and the poison angle, which made the first book so fascinating, was completly non-existent. Still, it was a very good story, and Yelena still manages to get into one scrape after another. Valek makes an appearence, but not until the second half of the book!Hopefully, I'll see more of him in the final book, Fire Study, which I'm eagerly awaiting from Amazon.

I\u2019m totally glad that someone told me that Velek was missing for the first half of this. Otherwise I would have been distracted wondering when I was going to see him again because he is my favorite character of this series so far.But since I knew that going into it I could focus on Yelena and meeting her family and getting to the school. When Yelena meets her family you would almost expect it to be sunshine and rainbows. But while many are willing to accept her it is clear right off that her brother isn\u2019t one of them. Others think she is a fake and a spy. So it is a bit of a rough start.The school isn\u2019t much better as some there also assume she is a spy. Irys might be a friend and mentor but it is clear that there are others that really don\u2019t want her there. But Yelena finds herself quickly thrown into the mix when a girl is recovered almost dead who had been the victim of a heinous crime. If Yelena can help to heal her then maybe they can find a serial killer before he claims yet another victim.The pacing and story move along at a decent pace and I did like Yelena getting more used to her magic and what she can do. I especially liked the time she spent with the Horses. I was worried for a second when Cahil, the exiled prince, showed up that we might have love triangle situation on our hands. But thank you to MVS for not putting us through that. Cahil also was a little bit of an enigma. Is he a good guy or a bad guy, should we like him or hate him. Well I was on the fence until the end when I clearly fell off onto the side I\u2019m meant to stay one. The same went for her brother Leif\n \u201cWhy did Mother ask you to help me rescue Gelsi?\" I asked Leif.\"She thought I could assist you in some way. Instead, I had tried to-\"\"Kill me?

Being honest, I feel that this book has taken a new direction, and this makes it completely different to the first book, even so, it was a lot of fun4/5 StarsYou can find this one and more of my reviews on my blog A Book. A Thought.\nIn Magic Study we can learn more about Yelena's past, and we'll see how she has to face completely new and unexpected situations. Many aspects of her past that she didn't know about will be revealed, while she tries to adapt to the meeting with her biological family and her customs and all of this will reveal who she really is. On the other hand we'll also see Yelena begin to understand how her magic works and we'll see her grow in this aspect a lot during this book. I personally think that magic is the protagonist in this occasion, that, and the incoportacion of new characters, which are ALOT and each of them will affect Yelena in some way and to her future actions as well\nI want to start highlighting how much the writing style has improve from one book to another, I love that since I want to read all the books, so knowing that in each one this aspect will improve makes really me excited. It was much easier to get into the plot this time, which is obvious since I'm more familiar with the story, but I attribute it to the writing style as well, that has been very fluid and addictive since the first page.This book in general has been very different from the first one, this is because we see Yelena established elsewhere, in a place where magic has a great weight and is very important for citizens. I remember that in Ixia magicians were not allowed then this has been a big change. I also think that the incorporation of so many new characters makes everything look new, you know? It's as if I just started reading a new series or something like that. Being surrounded by other landscapes and other culture also made me feel far from the main story. Being honest, I think this may not work for many of you, the fact that there is a lack of connection of one book with the other can annoy you or even make you stop caring about the plot. .Personally wasn't a problem for me at all, I enjoyed this book a lot, I loved meeting new characters and it seems very interesting to see where the plot is going now that many things have been clarified, especially the most important that focuses on the Yelena's magical powers and what they mean in this world.  That seemed great to me, I love magic when it's well managed and certainly liked it in this book.As for the characters, as I've said before, there are many new ones. I really liked the incorporation of the Master Magicians and I like that each one has a different personality, that's fun. \nI love reading the Yelena and Irys interactions\n, I feel that their relationship has grown a lot and as you know, because I've said it in previous reviews, I love master-student relationships, I find them adorable and super interesting to follow. I like Dax he's great, he's not a main character at all, but he seems like a super sweet guy and I really like that. I'd like to know more about Leif, I think he's a very complex character, but there's a lot in his mind and I haven't quite understood him yet, I find him a bit selfish the most part of the book and even though his actions are explained at the end, I feel that I need more of him to trust in this character. I'm excited to see what position Cahil will take, I think he's a very ambitious character, so I'm also interested in him. And finally I think Ferbe as a character is pretty creepy, it worked in some way like the villain, he's very evil and the things he has done are horrible, so obviously the darkness inside him isn't discussed, but still I would like to see more interaction between him and Yelena, because his scene together was too convenient and short. Ari and Janco are always two lights in the dark, I love them and I loved what they meant for Yelena in this book. (I've said Yelena a lot, I'm sorry, lol)As you already know, \nI like Yelena very much as the main character, she has made a lot of progress in this book and I'm proud of her decisions, she has also acquired an admirable strength and courage, so I love to follow her story.\nI absolutely and indisputably love Kiki, OMG this horse is the most beautiful thing in life, YES, it's a horse and that doesn't prevent it from being one of the best character I've ever read lolThere was something big that was missing and that is Valek, on the one hand, I like his absence and I understand it because he has let Yelena stand out and has given rise to new characters, but on the other hand, I think I've missed him too much, I liked his participation but I feel that I would have liked to see more of him. Also I think that his appearance in \"dreams\" was like WTF, I'm not sure if I liked that, I think I didn't get it actuallyI think the book should have finished a few chapters earlier than what it actually did, this is because I think that the end was stretched too much and all the time I was waiting for something to happen, but \nthen there is a small \"fight\" that only serves to get rid of a character, which doesn't make sense to me, it could have been interesting to leave everything for the next book and thus have been able to give a more important place to the whole fight scene that lasts about 2 seconds here\nI want to clarify that I liked what happens after this scene, there is a creation of a new conflict that I think will unleash very good things for the next book, I'm excited by the position that Yelena has taken in the plot, it will be super great to see what will bring her the future after everything that happenedFinally, I'm super excited to read the next book which will be the end for this trilogy, then I understand that there is another trilogy, I guess it follows other characters in the same world, which is great. I think there will be many surprises for the end, I want to see all the new characters along with the old ones and I want to see magic and all the political drama that characterizes these books, I would really like that"}, {"userName": "Tweebs\u2665\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35431290-tweebs", "userReview": "I lowkey went into this book thinking I'd be disappointed.

All have failed.\nI loved this!! I've read a lot of mixed reviews on this series and I've heard a lot of comments about how this series gets worse rather than better but I'd definitely have to disagree. I loved this second book in the series and I can't wait to continue on! I was definitely scared that this book would have that stereotypical second book syndrome since we wouldn't be seeing much of Valek but that never happened. There's still a little bit missing in order for this book to be a full 5 star but I definitely love love love this series!I'm actually loving the direction that this series is going. I'm so glad we got to see a whole different side of this world and there's much more magic than before! The plot has definitely expanded a lot from book 1 - Yelena was once a poison taster but now that's literally the least of her worries. Basically Yelena has magic and she gets reunited with her mother, father and brother, Leif - who was actually with Yelena when she was kidnapped and has dealt with that grief for 14 years. We're introduced to so many new characters but we still get a lot of time with our old crew from back in Ixia. How do I put into words how much I love Yelena and Valek? I just ship it so hard. I was highkey concerned that Cahil was going to get in the way and make a love triangle but luckily that didn't happen. I practically screamed when Valek was reunited with Yelena - I missed him so much but I'm definitely glad that Yelena got to learn and grow by herself first. \n\"Your life is like this snake's coils. No matter how many turns it makes, you'll end up back where you belong. With me.\"\n I really love Yelena herself and I never get bored of her POV. Her story is definitely an interesting one and there's so much more to learn about her. I'm so glad there's 6 books on her rather than just 3. Her magic is freaking cool. She can basically break into other peoples minds and manipulate them or she can simply just have a chat with them. (There's more to it but SPOILERS) I particularly loved the conversations she had with Kiki, her horse. Kiki herself was so funny and her little comments had my in stitches half the time. She's also obsessed with peppermints and tells Yelena that if she wants Irys to stop being mad at her, she should bring her peppermints because they make everyone happy. \nApple?You've grazed all night. How can you still be hungry?Always room for apple.\n I can't explain how happy I am that Ari and Janco are back. I was highkey concerned that we wouldn't see much of them but luckily they still were here for the last half. I love their relationship with Yelena and how protective and loving they are - despite the risks. Leif was an interesting addition to the story. I really liked him at first then I hated him and then I went back to liking him. I definitely want to see more of him - which I'm sure we will - and he definitely has his own demons to face. Also he has a really unique ability and so does Yelena so I wonder how they got this much random magic. I'm not sure if either of their parents have any magic or how magic even pops up in families so I hope we'll find out a reason behind this in the next few books.Cahil was a shit. I thought he would be okay but yeah nah he's not great. He's the King (haha) of temper tantrums and POOR ME I AM BIG KING BOY HOW DARE YOU BEAT ME. YOU MUST BE CHEATING IF YOU BEAT ME BECAUSE I AM SO STRONG. Cahil, please shut up and stop your shit man. I'm still loving this transgender representation (I still won't tell you who it is) but it's hugely appreciated - especially since this was a book published in 2008? when transgender acceptance wasn't really a thing.

Unfortunately, I feel like I was hit by a case of sequel-itis. 'Magic Study' was OK - but my enthusiasm fizzled out a bit.The story as a whole felt more juvenile than the first book, and was much less tightly plotted. it's more like, \"OK, what will Yelena do next?\" For most of the book, it's just her wandering from one situation to another. As the title indicates, the focus here is Yelena trying to learn how to use her magic skills. That magic is banned in Ixia, so she travels to the south to be reunited with the family she hasn't seen since she was six years old, and doesn't remember at all. Obviously, this is not a recipe for instant happiness - and indeed, her mother's got emotional issues and her brother is hostile and suspicious. People in both Ixia and the South suspect her of being a spy for the other side. And then, of course, there are the people who really do want her to spy for them.Yelena must try to balance her divided loyalties while also pursuing the goals she has for herself...It's a quick read, and I'm not ruling out reading more in this series, but I'm also not rushing into them right away."}, {"userName": "Jaclyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3015778-jaclyn", "userReview": "*4.5*  \"Living is a risk,\" I snapped at him. \"Every decision, every interaction, every step, every time you get out of bed in the morning, you take a risk.

This picks up directly after Poison Study with Yelena going off to meet her family and getting to know her magical abilities. There's a lot of mystery, magic, awesome new characters, some romance, family, kickass battle scenes and of course amazing character development. I am loving how far Yelena has come! She has become so badass, smart, confident, and strong. I love her! She's so much fun to read about!   Pushing magic toward the candle, I willed it to light. Nothing happened. Irys made a strangled sound and the candle burned. \"Are you directing your magic to the candle?\"\"Yes why?\"\"You just ordered me to light the candle for you,\" Irys said in exasperation. \"And I did it.\"  It was really cool watching Yelena grow to be more powerful and experiment with how far she could take her magic and we got to see this whole other world called the Citadel and the Keep. The world is definitely expanded in the book and we got to meet different groups, and see different lands. I was very impressed with the way the author was able to capture it so beautifully and show it to us. We got to meet new characters in this one such as Leif, Dax, all the four magicians, Kiki, and all the new villains who I don't want to say because spoilers! It's more fun to read it!   I'll have you know that the most delicate flowers often produce the strongest scent when crushed.  We got to really know Irys in this one and she is wonderful. She's so powerful and cares so much for Yelena. I really enjoyed watching that friendship develop. And Leif, who I love to hate. It's a very very complicated relationship. Yelena's family is great but her brother Lief is angered at Yelenas return but eventually towards the very very end he came around!   \"In the end only Leif believed that you were still alive. He thought you might be hiding somewhere, playing a game. As the rest of us grieved, Leif searched the jungle for you day after day.\"\"When did he finally stop?\" I asked.\"Yesterday.\" Another aspect I enjoyed in this was Yelenas horse Kiki! I love how they communicate it was so fun and gave the book a lighter tone.   \"Trust,\" Kiki said. \"Trust is peppermints.\" And then Cahil. Do not worry THERE IS NO LOVE TRIANGLE OR ANYTHING. And I can't stand him. That's all I'm going to say on him. Just read to find out more. And now Valek. I would have enjoyed this book ALOT less if I knew he was barely going to be in it. Thankfully I read reviews and so many people kept mentioning how he wasn't in it and how disappointed they were. Since I knew that going in I feel like I got to really settle into getting to know Yelena without him and appreciate her magical journey. Just because he's not in it as much doesn't mean his presences isn't felt frequently. He is mentioned many many times and then when he finally does come in at the very end, the happiness in that moment is so worth it.   He made a weak attempt to look innocent, but I knew better. \"Should I guess how many concealed weapons you have or should I strip search you?\" \"A strip search is the only way to be absolutely certain,\" Valeks deep blue eyes danced with delight.  *swoon* MY SHIP!!

Now she returns to Sitia, the country she was born in but taken from as a young child. Yelena rediscovers her lost family and culture, and then goes on to train with the master magicians, to learn to control and develop her new-found magic abilities. But it's not an easy change for Yelena, and many people openly reject her, including her brother, and the would-be king of Ixia, Cahil. And then of course Yelena cannot help but become involved in the search for a psychotic magician who has been randomly abducting, abusing and murdering young children.I felt that Magic Study was a bit of a let down from the previous novel. The book could have had a lot going for it, the prospect of returning to Yelena's magical country of birth was quite an exciting one, and at first things were fairly interesting, but the story began to fall flat soon enough. Snyder has not created a single interesting 'bad guy' character in this. Everyone that is against Yelena is obviously and openly so, shouting their opinions out in public. And none of them display enough cleverness to be a challenge.Yelena begins to display a recklessness and insensitivity that I truly would not have expected from her character. She continuously jumps into dangerous situations on her own, and to use her magic without any training or knowledge of the consequences, even to the risk of innocent people's lives. She herself talks about how forcing knowledge out of another persons mind with magic is akin to rape, and she should know, but she continously uses her magic on other people, including mind-reading, without consent. As do the other magic users, who you would believe are the 'good guys' and have enough experience to know better too. The style of the book is still firmly young-adult, like the last one. But I was shocked that there is even more incidence of adult themes than the last one, specifically rape. I am not going to say that rape shouldn't be mentioned in a YA book, but I think if you're going to use it, there should be some sensitivity in dealing with it. But here rape is just continuously thrown about, perhaps just for sensationalism on the writers behalf.. but I really don't think that's right, especially in a book for younger readers.Another big disappointment was the relationship between Yelena and Valek. In the previous novel the slow build of their relationship was one of the best aspects. Their relationship was still new when this novel started, it could have made things quite interesting, as Yelena was forced to leave Valek just as they had truly realised their feelings for eachother. But suddenly in this book, it's as if they're an old married couple, Valek is almost wildly out of character, doing nothing but turning up conveniently to hop into bed with Yelena and then do her bidding, repeatedly. Very disappointing in that respect.It's a shame as this book could have been better, and now it's putting me off YA-fantasy as a whole, and I'm not sure whether to read the 3rd book or not, no great loss since I bought them all 2nd hand (as I do most of my books when I can), but still... disappointed.See my other reviews of the Study trilogy:\u2190 #1 Poison Study | #3 Fire Study \u2192"}, {"userName": "Maggie \u2618 (Reader in Wonderland)", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40477684-maggie-reader-in-wonderland", "userReview": "\u201cTrust, Kiki said, Trust is peppermints.\u201d\n Oh, How I adored Yelena's horse!

Even thought I was extremely happy by Valek's comeback (duh), it felt a bit rushed.

No confusion here. No worries here. No troubles here.\"\n  The trust among them is rare,he didn't question her,he respected her decisions and tried to protect her although he was always risking his life.I ship them so hard!<3 Ari and Janco needed more scenes too!I have to read Fire Study asap,I can't wait to find out the conclusion of this story!And I hope Cahil suffers a very agonizing death.I hate him with a loathing passion.But Valek is right after all.\n\"Many have tried to kill us.

I seem to remember it being because of Valec's limited appearances however it meant I anticipated, as well as enjoyed, the scenes that much more second time around <3Original review 11/4/14:3.5 STARSI\u2019ve got mixed feelings towards this book. As Yelena is faced with even more problems you see her strength shine through even more and I know I\u2019ve said this before but it takes a lot of character to pull through to the other side still standing after everything. It was hard watching her struggle because when she hurt you hurt with her, and when she felt joy you did too; and this provided so many feels!I haven\u2019t even mentioned Valek yet; who I admit I have a major crush on. After reading Assassin Study which is Maria V Snyder\u2019s novella that occurs before this book I saw him in a whole new light. His devotion was blindingly clear for the ones he loved but he didn\u2019t need recognition to fuel this and it made him even more impressive in my eyes. This followed through in Magic Study but my problem was that you didn\u2019t see this again until like halfway through the book! The beginning was great and thoughtful but something was missing, and he didn\u2019t return until you\u2019d given up hope that he would make an appearance at all.He came just in time for the complicated plot to unfold with so many unexpected twists and mouth-gaping revelations. It would have meant nothing if it weren\u2019t for the characters though, who all have a place in this thrilling story. Whether it was to complicate Yelena\u2019s life or complete it is up to you to decide, and only once you\u2019ve read this book.While Magic Study was not as good as Poison Study I still enjoyed it, and if you haven\u2019t read any of the books you need to NOW! You won\u2019t regret it and I guarantee that you will love them too.Posted on: http://enchantedbyya.blogspot.co.uk/"}, {"userName": "Sheree", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1612410-sheree", "userReview": "4.5 starsIn the sequel to Poison Study, we follow Yelena, in exile, back to her homeland of Sitia where she is to study under the fourth Magician, Irys. After a reunion with the family that she hasn't seen since she was kidnapped at the age of 6, Yelena travels on to the Citadel to begin her training; to develop, harness and control her magic. The writing in Magic Study is definitely more refined, descriptive without being tedious and on a whole more enjoyable. There were none of the annoyances present in Ms Snyders writing that I found so irritating in Poison Study. While the whole magic theme wasn't quite as fascinating as the details on poisons in Poison Study, it was extremely enjoyable nonetheless. Once again danger and adventure are Yelena's constant companions so the story moves along at a good pace. Yelena becomes embroiled in the hunt for a rogue magician who is torturing young girls and stealing their souls to increase his own power. This takes place while Yelena is in the process of discovering some unique and powerful abilities. Control of her magic is a slow developing skill, as is the dawning of understanding of the difference between self-reliance, independence & arrogance. I thoroughly enjoyed the appearance of familiar characters from Poison Study in this story, the loveable Ari and Janco and of course Valek. Valek's re-appearance allows the love interest between Yelena & Valek to subtly develop. I wasn't quite as attached to the new cast of characters in Magic Study but I did like Moon Man and the boy Fisk. The shortage of characters to love was more than made up for by the inclusion of Kiki, Yelena's horse. Kiki plays an intricate part in Magic Study, she's a delightful addition to the story & the magical connection between Yelena & Kiki touched my heart. Yelena's journey in Magic Study is one of growth & self discovery & I can't wait to see what awaits Yelena and readers in Fire Study."}, {"userName": "Kells Next Read ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44081906-kells-next-read", "userReview": "\"You're the heart mate of the most wanted criminal in Sitia.\"No surprise at my ratings seeing how I devoured this book with just as much enthusiasm as it's predecessor.
