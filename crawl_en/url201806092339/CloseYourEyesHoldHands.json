I like this author 'a lot' --I've enjoyed all of his other books --yet this book just does not feel authentic. Its not a 'horrible' book....but its 'off'. I'm not sure that 'anything' I write will be the 'reason' for the 'off-ness' or not. I'm not a writer. (but this book is lacking feeling). A reader can only be 'talked-to' for so long. I felt like I was being 'talked-to' this entire novel --with almost no emotion --it feels borderline rude. Right from start of this novel we learn that Emily is an only child --(of parents who were both only children). No other mention of this was said during the novel...(no ties with the story anyway).I was left thinking:... \"I know this author does his research\" --... \"but did he dive into research about 'only children\"? ... \"I'm not so sure\" -- ... \"Emily, 16 years old --does not fit 'the voice' of an only child. (even with a mental illness in my opinion). A bright girl --well read, such as Emily, does not need to 'act' like she is 12 or 13. Her 'entire' voice felt like a 12 or 13 year old girl. ...Also: I've raised daughters --(I taught Phys. Ed. to teen girls) --We had tons of girls in this house for years. Not 'one' 16 year old girl I knew (with or without a mental illness) --talked the way Emily did in this book. 12 maybe?/! But....back to this story:...With Emily's mental illness -- she self-medicates with cutting, smoking pot, having sex with truckers, stealing,... --the problem is ...we, (as readers), want to 'care' and feel something --for this girl. Yet ---because the pacing of Emily's voice is often ongoing rambling ---this story just feels boring and somewhat annoying. To mix a story about a nuclear disaster with a disturbed teenager -- (sounds to me --as if it has possibilities) --- but the tone was lacking sincere passion. There was one place in the book where I became fully 'awake' --(ready to have my 'guts-in-knots' with a wide range of emotions) ---but damn --if, it did not fall short--It was the part when there was reference to the massacred of the children and teachers at the elementary school in Newton, Connecticut --giving us 'depth' to the title of this book. .....Yet---nothing more was developed ---I like a good contemporary book! I love \"Double Bind\" by Chris Bohjalian. -- but I'm not inspired with this one, nor any new insights. Who is the audience for this book? Adults? or Young adults? I'm really not sure either is a perfect match."}, {"userName": "Betsy Hetzel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24531548-betsy-hetzel", "userReview": "This book has ALL the makings of a gigantic tear-jerker: the teenage, female main character's parents are killed in a nuclear plant explosion, her alcoholic, engineer father is blamed and she, Emily, their only child, is vilified. She winds up in shelters so she has something to eat, in apartments w/ druggies who \"force\" her into prostitution so she has someplace to stay, and when these fail, she's out on the streets building an igloo w/ leaves held together by ice and pilfering/stealing what she can to survive, taking but an occasional shower at the local Y. She befriends a run-away nine year old abused foster boy whom she considers her responsibility and when he falls ill w/ encephalitis, she takes him and must leave him at the hospital, all the while cutting herself w/ her Exacto knife and remembering poems by Emily Dickenson. Did I say that she \"lost\" her precious dog Maggie the day the nuclear reactor exploded? I thought that I would be a tear-stained mess reading ALL that Emily had to go through and endure yet.... I FELT nothing. I was TOLD all these horrible things, but there were no feelings expressed and that, for me, was the flaw: the book lacked feeling. However, I will amend this statement slightly because in the latter part of the book when Emily returns to what remains of her home and, one day, miraculously, her dear dog Maggie returns to her, that reunion did cause a lump in my throat; perhaps my feelings were more for Maggie who was in bad shape. Also, when the explanation of the title of the book was revealed, the lump in my throat grew even bigger. The author reminded us of the school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, and as the children exited the building, so that they would not see the slain bodies of their classmates, the teachers told them to, \"Close your eyes, hold hands.\" Heart-breakingly poignant. Was it the 1st person narration of Emily that was so devoid of feeling that I too felt nothing? OR, was it simply just being told, again and again, like a laundry list of unpleasant actions w/ no accompanying feelings expressed that turned it off for me? I wish that I could better explain this emptiness that I felt, and I hope that you might understand what I'm trying to distinguish between TELLING and FEELING. I have enjoyed other Bohjalian books but will have to remain disappointed w/ this one. And, I realize that I will be in the minority here again with this review.

In CLOSE YOUR EYES, HOLD HANDS, author Chris Bohjalian has created an amazing portrait of a teen in crisis. After being orphaned by a nuclear disaster for which her father may have been responsible, Emily sets off on the run. She needs a protector, a family, an adult. Instead,she faces a series of catastrophic choices that lead her deeper into danger. Her only support during this time is the poetry of Emily Dickinson, in whom she finds a kindred spirit.In this novel, Bohjalian offers a glimpse into the mind of a traumatized young woman. His first person narrative voice is on target and incredibly authentic. Particularly moving is the subplot about the transformative power of literature, and how poetry can save your soul. I loved this novel. Set aside a few hours to be swept away. You won't want to leave Emily alone for a minute.This is sure to very popular on the book club circuit and will also find an audience with older teen readers.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Stephen Kiernan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7582177-stephen-kiernan", "userReview": "Eighteen books into his career. Chris Bohjalian has created his wisest and most compelling narrator ever. Emily Shepherd has survived the meltdown of a nuclear plant in her Vermont hometown, but the accident has left her orphaned, homeless, and on the run from people seeking a scapegoat for the disaster. By the bottom of page two she will have you hooked, and rooting for her, as life gets harder and a 16-year-old's capacity for survival is tested in all directions.A clear-eyed examination of teenage street life, and a thought experiment about nuclear disaster that never once turns preachy, this novel is one of Bohjalian's best -- on a par with Midwives or Sandcastle Girls.

It seemed like part of a story to me, the middle part mostly, as if someone had ripped out a large chunk of a diary: a little disjointed, a little hard to follow, very difficult to connect to. The bones of a fantastic story were there but the way it was executed left me feeling very little. I was most affected by the explanation of the title, which had little to do with the story yet it shook me to my core.

Surprisingly good.\u00a0 He does it all the time.\u00a0 Now we have him perfecting the personality of teenager Emily Shepherd in Vermont after her parents\u00a0are presumed killed in a meltdown of the nuclear\u00a0 power plant where they were both employed.\u00a0 Emily recounts from her journal entries how she travels around in the aftermath (afterglow in some places), just\u00a0 trying to survive and\u00a0find out not only if her mom and dad died, but if her alcoholic dad could have\u00a0 been responsible for the meltdown, drunk on the job. She has to change\u00a0 her name so she won't be associated with him.\u00a0 Along\u00a0 the way\u00a0 she learns\u00a0 to be a responsible young adult, but has to get some other things out of her system first. Emily's favorite poet, and I guess Bohjalian's too, is Emily Dickinson, of whom I am not a fan.\u00a0 A good deal of Emily's journal entries are comparing herself to that other Emily. But my favorite part of the book was when she joked that most if not all of Dickinson's\u00a0 poems can be sung to the theme from Gilligan's Island. Try it...Because I did not stop for death,It kindly stopped for me.The carriage held but just ourselvesAnd immortality.A three hour tour. Anyway, if that was the best part of the book, I have to say this is probably my least favorite by this author overall. I still have to give it 3.5 stars for C.B.'s storytelling abilities, and his sensitivity to female struggles."}, {"userName": "Patrice Hoffman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5405898-patrice-hoffman", "userReview": "After a brief hiatus due to personal issues, I tried to get back into Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands but never quite could. It's not to say that Chris Bohjalian's writing isn't good, or that the novel isn't interesting. It just seems that I could never reacquaint myself with the narrator Emily Shepard. I will do my best...Emily Shepard introduces herself by telling readers of her life in an igloo as a homeless child. One horrific accident, involving her parents caused her to be in that position. Both her parents work in a nuclear power plant in Vermont where a Chernobyl-like event happens. The whole town of Cape Abenaki is forced to evacuate due to radiation. In less than a few hours, her father, an engineer, and her mother, a communications director, are the most hated people in America since alcohol may have played in the disaster as well. Fearing that she may be as well, Emily decides to create a new past. Emily splits the story into two sections. One is BC, before Cameron and AC, after Cameron. Cameron is a nine year old she comes to look after while she is on the streets of Vermont. He too has been dealt a bad hand, having been placed in one bad foster home after another. Cameron gives Emily's life purpose finally. Before Cameron, she was somewhat of a trouble-maker and essentially being a teen.I usually don't read too much Young Adult fiction. There's something about the teen voice and the \"me, me, me\" thing that really grates on my nerves. Bohjalian took care not to make me regret picking this up. Emily's voice isn't the norm, although much of that can be due to the fact that she's lost so much. She's wise beyond her years yet so damaged. Readers will instantly know that somethings wrong with her mentally and will want to protect her from the world and herself. Seeing Emily do well is what kept me reading on.As I mentioned, I had a week long hiatus from any serious reading and once I did pick this back up, I just couldn't really focus. It's not due to Bohjalian's writing at all. Overall, Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands is a formidable coming of age story that may tug at the heartstrings. The story of Emily Shepard is one that should not be missed.Copy provided by Doubleday via Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie", "userReview": "[ I think maybe the only emotional feelings I got were in regards to Maggie being alive!

It was not what I expected at all; it's a dark story and I wasn't prepared for the themes it presented. The world building of this dystopian/post-apocalyptic tale is excellent and the character development is well done, so good that parts were hard to read. This story is told narration style by the lead character Emily Shepard. This teenager's world has literally fallen apart. She has nothing but her name, and the slight mention of her name in public puts her in danger so she doesn't even have that anymore. She's attempting to survive emotionally and physically the best way she knows how. I could hear Emily's voice through the writing style, as the story was told with some distractions, spontaneous stops and starts, and terminology typical of a teenager. Emily is resilient, tough, and honest, and she loves Emily Dickinson. I enjoyed her as a main character. Personally, I wouldn't re-read this book though. It's well done, it just felt too real which really says something for the author. Please note that this is not for young adults!

And our narrator's igloo is a set piece of no real importance. We start out there but quickly wander away into back story. Emily's parents both worked at the nuclear plant--her father in operations, her mother in PR. She was a troubled, even crazy, teenager even before the meltdown, she tells us (although her misbehavior sounds like typical teenaged hormones and misjudgment to me, not remotely classifiable as mental illness). We spend some time recounting the (remarkably mild) drama of the accident itself, which Emily experienced mostly through the evacuation effort. And together with Emily we overhear a suspiciously convenient conversation among the aid workers, who blame Emily's parents for the meltdown and discuss how she'll be made to take the stand against them. Cue Emily fleeing the official rescue operation, and striking out on her own.This is a huge weak point--Bohjalian's willingness to base an entire plot around a character's dubious decision, and to base that dubious decision on information delivered in such a clunky way. It's not hard to believe that people might bad-mouth the plant operators after a meltdown. It's not hard to believe there might be scapegoats. And investigating how we apportion blame in catastrophes is interesting, to say the least. But Bohjalian can't seem to decide whether Emily's parents were ever plausibly to blame in the first place. Emily tells us they're functioning alcoholics. But she also tells us that there's no way they were drunk at the plant on the day of the accident. It's hard to know how reliable her information really is, and Bohjalian doesn't pursue the issue. The whole thing feels like a frustrating red herring, rather than an interesting exploration of individual and collective blame. Emily's story wanders back and forth between time frames, as she tells her story from the post-story vantage point of some kind of institutional therapy. It's hard to see the method in the movements and at times it's hard to care, because she's so aimless and depressed and adrift. Along the way she picks up a cute nine year-old kid named Cameron, who's almost offensively undeveloped. As far as I could tell, Cameron existed to be pummeled by abusive foster parents and cast out into the streets, so that Emily could take responsibility for him at least temporarily. I don't think he gets more than half a dozen lines before he's shuffled off again with flue that turns into encephalitis, thereby adding to Emily's angst and self-hatred. I suppose it's refreshing that a boy was fridged for once, instead of a girl or woman...but then again, not really.This is a book with a big premise, but its world never expands beyond Emily's claustrophobic, short-horizon existence. Even when she makes the decision to sneak back into the radioactive exclusion zone in search of her left-behind dog, the plot feels weak. Because she spends so much of her time in isolation or with other blinkered characters (drug addicts, prostitutes, homeless people just getting by), there's never any sense of what's happening in the bigger world. How does the country react to a major nuclear catastrophe, resulting in a no-go zone on American soil? That's another interesting question, but not one that we get to explore.My biggest problem with this book is simple and sad: the so-what problem. I never cared much about Emily, much less poor old Cameron. By the end of the book I felt like I'd been dragged along on a road trip with a teenager making the worst possible decisions and suffering some of the worst possible consequences. But I couldn't tell you why I'd made that trip. I finished reading because I'm a completist.An important side note: I listened to this book, which I think is tougher on any book than reading it. Audio forces you to sit through every word of every sentence. You can't skim the parts where an editor should have cut words, the way you can in print. And in this particular case, the audio was read very strangely, by a narrator who turned out to be Bohjalian's daughter. I listened with bemusement to the epilogue conversation that explained this. Bohjalian's daughter seems like a fan of his work, and he seems happy with her recording of it, and maybe that's what's most important.

Both her parents were employees at the facility, and it appears her father, perhaps in a drunken state, is responsible for the meltdown.The story follows Emily's journey for the next year or so, as she makes one bad choice after another. While the story had a lot of potential, it really fell short for me. The book is under 300 pages, yet it is extremely repetitive.Because the story is told from a teenage girls view, it's told in a sort of choppy voice, which actually comes across as fairly authentic, but the story skips around so much that sometimes it is hard to keep up.

The guys in the boat are in danger of drowning, and the morons on the beach are waving at them because they have no idea.

I read The Night Strangers by Chris Bohjalian a few years ago, and it was so creepy in such a deep psychological way that I still think about it sometimes and it gives me the shivers. Close your Eyes, Hold Hands is probably going to affect me similarly in the future, not because it was scary or terrifying, but because it was so emotionally jarring. This is a hard book to get through. There are a lot of issues that are being addressed or at least mentioned; drug use, cutting, underage sex, teenage homelessness, radiation poisoning. But really, at its heart, this is a book about survival. What it takes to survive a traumatic situation, and how one copes with it. So many heart-wrenching things about this book, but I feel like it will always stay with me if at least for the fact that underneath all the sadness, there always remains a glimmer of hope.Maybe I wanted to be alone.

Totally understandable, given that she\u2019s been orphaned by a nuclear plant disaster where both her parents worked, she\u2019s homeless, and she\u2019s one of the most reviled people in Vermont, if not all of America. This is her story.The novel is told as a series of journal entries, or writings encouraged by a therapist to help the writer (Emily) understand how she came to this point in her life. Opening line: I built an igloo against the cold out of black plastic trash bags filled with wet leaves.. This gave me the sense that this was going to be a post-apocalyptic novel. But it isn\u2019t post-apocalyptic, or not for everyone; the world doesn\u2019t change for everyone, though it definitely changes for Emily. The disastrous melt-down at the nuclear plant where both her parents worked has resulted in thousands of people being displaced and serious questions asked about how this could have happened. One name keeps coming up \u2013 Emily\u2019s father, who was known to have a drinking problem and is rumored to have been drunk on the job. So rather than stay with her classmates in their evacuation center, Emily sets out on her own. The story moves back and forth in time, as she recollects and records the events and decisions that led her to where she is when she\u2019s writing it down. Like many teens \u2013 especially teens using drugs or alcohol, or with poor impulse control, or serious self-doubt \u2013 Emily\u2019s recollections are not linear. She bounces from subject to subject, introducing characters and then saying, \u201cbut I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d She also has issues with trusting authority figures and may not be telling the entire truth all the time, in an effort to shield herself, her parents or her companions. To say she\u2019s an unreliable narrator is putting it mildly. Often, I was irritated with her, but I grew to like her and root for her. She was intelligent, resilient, tried to be responsible, and very vulnerable. By the end I was so worried about her I cried out when it was over \u2026 I wanted to know what is next for her and I was afraid to know.Grace Blewer does a fine job narrating the audio version. Blewer is Bohjalian\u2019s daughter, and she helped him with the slang and cadence of speech so that he could write in a more-believably-teen-aged voice.

Emily Shepherd promises to tell the whole truth; she doesn\u2019t sugarcoat it for readers, and she sometimes strays from the topic of hand, but the novel flows beautifully and I was enamored from the very beginning.Life hasn\u2019t been easy for Emily, and as the final remnants of her world fall apart with the meltdown of the nuclear power plant her parents run, disappearing becomes her only option. Scared of those around her and their reception of her family name, Emily takes on a different persona and hits the streets. This gritty depiction of her life as she recalls it isn\u2019t overly graphic, but gets the point across just the same as it comes to drugs, stealing, shelter survival, lies, and meaningless sex.I love Emily\u2019s voice, and I\u2019m in awe of Bohjalian\u2019s ability to capture the essence of a teenaged girl as she hits rock bottom, attempts to care for a young runaway she meets on the street, and ultimately giving up. Where do you go when you have absolutely no one? As Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands unfolds, readers become one with Emily as she spirals down, reminiscing about her parents and her experiences along the way.The title has a rather profound meaning that is explained near the very end\u2014to close your eyes to the bad all around you and walk away from the bad, holding hands with another who will help keep you grounded, but in Emily\u2019s case, there is no one to hold hands with, and as she stumbles blindly through life, ready for death, she becomes a resilient, strong young woman who beats the odds."}, {"userName": "Marti", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2259573-marti", "userReview": "Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands by Chris Bohjalian is beyond my meager words to describe. I found it to be provoking, poignant, unpredictable (which is to be expected with a teenager as a main character) and unforgettable. I think we often forget how much teenagers feel and how things can be so over the top with them.Emily\u2019s parents work in the local nuclear reactor. She is an only child who has been lashing out at her parents for their attention and about their drinking. Her favorite companion is Maggie, a black lab. Little does she know in the matter of a few hours she will lose everything. The book focuses on Emily\u2019s time when she was alone. Her battles for survival with pain, loneliness, emptiness, and homelessness will eat at you.How Chris Bohjalian takes us on this journey is the most remarkable part of the story. This is not a light summer read. It is not a lazy day read. It is a condemnation of our current human paths. He manages to simultaneously focus our attention on homelessness, cutting, the dangers of nuclear reactors, and Emily Dickinson\u2019s poetry.This book is going on my \u201ccan\u2019t let go\u201d shelf. That shelf is full of books that I find myself thinking about long after I put the book down.

Since then I have read two of his historical fictions The Sandcastle Girls and The Light in the Ruins. Each story is vastly different, beautiful, captivating and memorable. It seems no matter what story Bohjalian tells it is destined to entwine itself into my memory.I am not going to lie; when I saw this title on NetGalley, I requested it without even reading the synopsis. It did not matter it was Chris Bohjalian!! When I began reading I was pleasantly surprised and a little shocked to hear the voice of sixteen-year-old Emily Shepard.The tale begins in Burlington Vermont; Emily is homeless, living in a garbage bag igloo. It has been a year since the power plant her parents worked at had a nuclear meltdown and the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont evacuated and quarantined. The press and the people blame the meltdown on her father.Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands is beautifully written and told entirely through the voice of our protagonist Emily Shepard. It is raw; at times, her voice bounces from thought to thought. She adores the poet Emily Dickinson and references her. Emily is wise beyond her years and at other times her age rings through. She takes us through the day of the meltdown, and offers flashbacks of life before the disaster. She does not hold back about her life after the accident. Life on the streets and the dark side to her suffering pour forth as she shares her story. It is genuine and at times hard to swallow. We learn about her fears, the friendships she makes and her journey back from this dark place.Bohjalian is brilliant. Emily\u2019s voice is authentic, and he impressed me with her voice. From her language to feelings, Bohjalian gave her life making her one of the most memorable and fleshed out characters I have ever encountered. Secondary characters were interesting, and influenced my emotions but it was Emily herself that held me captive. Her voice had me lost within the pages of Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands.Readers will need to acclimate themselves as Emily speaks directly to the reader. Picture if you will sitting across from a young girl. She is fidgety, and from time to time, she stares off as if lost in her own thought. Then her gaze clears, and she refocuses on you. She begins telling you are story; she is animated, and often injects poems, thoughts and ideas. It is all fascinating and at times, it makes you squirm or want to hug her. Instinctively you know she will not like that. The hours tick away, and you become lost in her story. It sometimes seems surreal, but Emily has this raw honesty and somehow you know she has kept nothing back. Occasionally a memory manifests and she takes a break to share that tale with you.Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands is adult literary fiction, but the protagonist will introduce Bohjalian to older young adults. He is brilliant, and I am on a personal mission to read all of his novels. Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands was gripping, raw and authentic. Emily Shepard is a character who will mark herself in your memory and Bohjalian is an author whose books you will reach for repeatedly.Copy received from publisher in exchange for unbiased review that originally published @  Caffeinated Book Reviewer"}, {"userName": "Casey Hampton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7010826-casey-hampton", "userReview": "TUF: Tedious. Uneventful. Frustrating.I was interested to learn what was happening with the dog, but that's about it. This story is about a young girl trying to survive a nuclear meltdown, and I didn't give a damn, not one little damn. I wanted to care about the characters, what they were facing, how they were overcoming, but in the end... I just didn't. Sure, the situation is interesting enough, but it's the characters we either root for, or against. We need to see growth of some sort, for the better, or for the worse. But having characters that never change is about as entertaining as watching a plate of scrambled eggs sitting on a table. Or perhaps it's more like looking at a photo of a plate of scrambled eggs sitting on a table. That's probably more like it.I don't enjoy bagging on books. And I certainly don't wish to sound like some loud-mouthed jerk hammering a meaty hand to emphasize my points. So, I won't. I will however make one observation.Showing/Telling:This story is almost entirely told to the reader rather than being shown. Telling me that you feel sad doesn't do anything for me. Show me the wet grief rolling down your face, or show me you furtively turning away so I don't see your burning tears. But don't tell me you are sad, don't tell me it's cold outside, don't tell me about your messed up life. SHOW ME. Don't tell me about the money; show me the money.Grace Blewer is the audiobook narrator. In the interview that follows the reading of the story, author Chris Bohjalian reveals that Grace Blewer is his daughter. Blewer's reading was unremarkable, but I think she captures the voice of the main character."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4631464-tara", "userReview": "I won a copy of this book in a First Reads giveaway. Here is Amazon's description of the book:Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands is the story of Emily Shepard, a homeless teen living in an igloo made of ice and trash bags filled with frozen leaves. Half a year earlier, a nuclear plant in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom had experienced a cataclysmic meltdown, and both of Emily's parents were killed. Devastatingly, her father was in charge of the plant, and the meltdown may have been his fault. Was he drunk when it happened? Thousands of people are forced to flee their homes in the Kingdom; rivers and forests are destroyed; and Emily feels certain that as the daughter of the most hated man in America, she is in danger. So instead of following the social workers and her classmates after the meltdown, Emily takes off on her own for Burlington, where she survives by stealing, sleeping on the floor of a drug dealer's apartment, and inventing a new identity for herself -- an identity inspired by her favorite poet, Emily Dickinson. When Emily befriends a young homeless boy named Cameron, she protects him with a ferocity she didn't know she had. But she still can't outrun her past, can't escape her grief, can't hide forever\u2014and so she comes up with the only plan that she can. This book has a unique story line and kept me engrossed throughout. The author does a great job of embracing the narrator's voice and taking us along on her heartbreaking journey of survival. Well written and fully engaging, I think this book should appeal to both adults and the YA crowd."}, {"userName": "Laurielib", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4024791-laurielib", "userReview": "Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands was hard to put down. Bohjalian's writing and characters are so impeccably crafted. Emily Shepard is a new teen heroine identified as the \"Queen of Underachievers\" and suffering from \"impulse control\". An the only child of two unhappy, yet loving, parents who work at a Vermont nuclear power plant, Emily struggles with growing up and fitting in. Bohaljian captures all the pain, angst and emotional immaturity associated with the teen years. When the plant suffers a meltdown and her father is blamed, Emily is on the run. I found her character very similar to Theo's in the Goldfinch. Both are caught up in tragedies, lack the maturity to understand their situations and make unfortunate choices. The book is divided into BC Before Cameron and AC After Cameron. In AC Emily's true character engages the reader. The emotional impact of the book is so powerful rising to a crescendo when the reader reaches the end and discovers the source of the title. This is a great book for teens moving into adult fiction."}, {"userName": "Harry Brake", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14064432-harry-brake", "userReview": "I breezed through this in about 4 days and the 271 pages honestly, were not long enough. A gift from a an author, this was more than a gift. Heartbreaking, realistic, yet letting us in to the plight of many individuals, life situations, and the scary potential of technology and its aftermath, this novel on relationships bring you aboard this roller coaster of emotion from the very beginning. Raw in the absolute right places, the ongoing relationships of Emily, the fallout and shadow of how her parents are received a look at how most people in life criticize without thought, as well as the tumultuous struggle to simply survive, Chris Bohjalian is AMAZING at capturing lives affected by tragedy, offering those glimmers of hope that keep you and the characters moving forward, and simply, helping you get lost in this novel.

However, I do believe this rating is accurate. This was a rambling, stream of consciousness book that never solidified into a story for me. There were plot lines that were unresolved threads that could have been lifted from the book and never affected the plot line (Emily's cutting).

In fact, if the trucker sex was a bit less graphic, I probably would not only have put it on my YA shelf, but suggested it as suitable reading for my 12 year old (and I don't censor much). It reminded me a bit of Age of Miracles and was in general very YA in tone.The concept of a nuclear meltdown in Vermont (on American soil!) is a great one and I felt could have been much better done. Emily is not a bad narrator and she has a few good insights (my favorite was: \"We watch it, we read about it, and then we move on. As a species, we're either very resilient or super callous. I don't know which\"), but the story was just a point A to point B to point C kind of story. There is no real character development (Emily is cynical and jaded from the get-go as she is writing in hindsight) and no real plot development. This is just kind of a nothing story.I did like the anti-climax when drunk mom apologized and everyone became warm and fuzzy at Lisa's (nice when something unexpected but with less drama happens in a novel). On the flip side, I did not like the Camille both approached Emily in the mall (too convenient) and became nice and helpful when they needed someone the most.As an aside, I did not think the title was topically relevant (yes, school shootings and nuclear blowouts are both disasters, but different sorts) and would have expected an editor to cut both the passage and the title.Overall it wasn't a bad book, but there was nothing spectacular. It was mostly just a quick read."}, {"userName": "Olga", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4564931-olga", "userReview": "I love Bohjalian, have read all, follow him on FB, have great respect for his interest in really tough issues. My favorite is \"Before You Know Kindness\". I was so excited to be the first one at my library to check out the CD book \"Close your eyes, hold hands\". Great narrator - both the character and the performer, Chris's daughter Grace Experience. Tough issues, as always. But...This time I did not loose sleep over the book. Enjoyed it, was interested but did not loose sleep. Not having been (for many years) or even raised a teen-age girl (have sons), I was completely taken by the character of Emily. Believed her and in her. Totally believed her voice and her lingo.I just wish there were more depth. I was looking forward to exploration of the issue of nuclear power, with the usual Bohjalian's even handedness and deep analysis of several view points. Unfortunately, this book spent more than half describing misadventures of a homeless teenager (kind of like a modern day \"Oliver Twist\"). And while my heart goes out to a kid who had been dealt a tough hand in life (well, alcoholic parents, loneliness, losing her dog... and oh, yes, surviving a nuclear disaster in her backyard). All that made for a good read, but more so for YA audiences. As an adult I had hoped for multiple voices pro and con nuclear power. The lone 16 y.o.

I especially noted his statement, \" I've written some really terrible books...The books that are tree-killing mediocrities are those that I begin without a clear vision.\" I can think of one or two which I would agree are what he also calls \"clunkers\". I wonder if he would agree.

I do like most of your books. The last time I experienced this distaste involved another teen-age girl in, Secrets of Eden. I confess, I have not finished this novel yet, but I discovered what it is that I do not enjoy here. It is written in the voice of an adolescent young lady. It does not ring true!(It certainly is not your voice!) I definitely would categorize this novel in the Young Adult genre. I have enjoyed some of these books, but this litany of the misadventures of this teen, just does not light that fire.So, Chris, I shall put this aside unfinished. Perhaps one of my respected GR Friends can convince me to continue with it."}], "description": "A heartbreaking, wildly inventive, and moving novel narrated by a teenage runaway, from the best-selling author of Midwives and The Sandcastle Girls.Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands is the story of Emily Shepard, a homeless teen living in an igloo made of ice and trash bags filled with frozen leaves.
