But good? No, only really remarkable people see the good in others.\"A fatal grace is the 2nd installment in Inspector Armand Gamache cozy mystery series. In Still Life I was introduced to the inspector and his team and fell in love with Three Pines, the little village where the action takes place. Gamache is a chief inspector in the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, an honorable and complex character whose main approach to solving a murder is to listen. He has to return to Three Pines after a year and a half in order to solve another murder. This time, one of the most hated villagers is electrocuted in the middle of a frozen lake during a curling match and nobody seems to have seen anything and at first sight the crime seems impossible. In this volume I learned more about the personalities of Gamache and his team, about their past and their fears. Also, I enjoyed revisiting some of the villagers from last book: Gabri and Olivier- the heart-warming gay couple, Myrna- the librarian, Ruth - the cranky poet, Clara and Peter - the artists. They all feel like a big family and Gamache is received in with open arms among them due to his pleasant personality. \"Gamache was the best of them, the smartest and bravest and strongest because he was willing to go into his own head alone, and open all the doors there, and enter all the dark rooms. And make friends with what he found there.And he went into the dark, hidden rooms in the minds of others. The minds of killers. And he faced down whatever monsters came at him. \"The mystery was a bit more complex than last time and although I guessed the murderer from early on I enjoyed the ride and the plot twists. The writing is beautiful, poetic in places, and it managed to transport me to the snow covered Three Pines, a place I plan to revisit soon.Important! I believe this series should be read in order because we have a lot of personal details from all characters and conflicts that continue in the following volumes, there are references to the previous volumes so they might not be savoured so well read randomly"}, {"userName": "Susan Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3602867-susan-anderson", "userReview": "Where to begin with all the richness that A FATAL GRACE gave me. Reading it, I wondered how I had lived so long without discovering the work of Louise Penny, a first-rate writer. Her creation in this book is so real, her writing so lyrical, her characters so unique and the book's structure and meaning so complex that I began mumbling to myself, taking my sweet time reading the book in order to savor its mix of flavors, its innuendoes and subtleties, having at times to stop and scratch my head. It hurts me sometimes to have to hunt for meaning, but in this case the reward was worth the pain.The characters are memorable. I especially liked chief inspector Armand Gamache and his wife Reine-Marie and I loved the painter, Carol, her fragility and her luminous works; the enigmatic figure, Agent Nichol and the bag lady, Elle, and I could hear with Emilie's ears Tchaikovsky's violin concerto in D. I loved Ruth, the drunken and slovenly poet who at one point declares she committed the crime, a total hoot. And of course, the setting, Three Pines, a quaint, snowy village in the Quebec province of the author's imagination.The book is about the murder by electrocution on Christmas of the despicable C.C. de Poitiers, a character we love to hate. But it is also about the power of words and how they save and how they hurt. And it is about the agony of the people they destroy.A FATAL GRACE is not for everyone, not an easy read, but it is a fascinating mystery and a work of genius. It kept me guessing until the end. So if you love mystery and rare, rich setting; if you long for unique characters and meaning deep as bones, then don't miss A FATAL GRACE."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "[to another sad loss nearby.

Also the story takes place at Christmas in a picture perfect town where the snow sparkles in the sun and everyone drinks hot chocolate and eats cookies. What more does a book need?Actually of course it needs characters and this book does not lack anything in that area. There are characters galore, most of them slightly quirky or even quite outrageous. The main character,Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, is the ultimate in detective fiction heroes. He appears to have no faults and charms everyone he meets. Except for the few who hate him for reasons that are not totally clear yet.

She has also created a richly-imagined setting in the charming Canadian village of Three Pines, which is located somewhere just south of Montreal. The tiny hamlet is populated by a cast of quirky but mostly lovable characters who spend a lot of time walking through the snow and curling up in front of blazing fires. In doing so, Penny has attracted a legion of enthusiastic readers who, apparently, can hardly wait for each new installment of the series to appear.This is the second book in the series and the second that I've read, in both cases because the book was selected by one of the book clubs to which I belong. Having done so, I can stand back and dispassionately appreciate Penny's accomplishment; my problem is that this just isn't the sort of book that appeals to me. Inspector Gamache is just a bit too perfect and life in the little snow-globe village of Three Pines is just a bit too saccharine for my taste.I don't mean that to sound as dismissive as it probably does, and again, I understand that there are large numbers of readers who would love to live in Three Pines, but I'd probably go stark raving mad in less than a week.In thinking about it, it occurred to me that, on the one hand, you have the world of Three Pines and, on the other, for example, the world of Matthew Scudder's New York City as imagined by Lawrence Block. And it strikes me that, while certainly there would be exceptions to the rule, most of the people who enjoy hanging out in Scudder's New York aren't going to want to spend a lot of time in Gamache's Three Pines, and vice-versa. What it comes down to, I guess, is that I'm just one of those people who would much rather spend a night hanging out with Matt and Mick Ballou, drinking a good Irish whiskey at Grogan's Open House than I would sitting around a pleasant fire at the bistro in Three Pines, drinking a nice hot chocolate.In this case, a particularly unpleasant woman is murdered in a very complicated and public way while attending a curling match. Sitting at the front of the crowd, the victim stands up, touches the chair in front of her and is promptly electrocuted.Gamache is called to investigate and soon is digging into the secrets and tangled relationships of the little village that go back for years. At the same time, he is assisting in another totally unrelated murder, that of a street person who is killed in Montreal. All of this occurs in the dead of winter and the weather itself becomes an important factor in the story.The story takes a number of twist and turns and, again, I can understand its appeal. But I did have a lot of trouble buying into the way the Three Pines murder occurred; it just seemed completely implausible to me and unnecessarily complicated. As one of the characters asked, why go to all that trouble? Why not simply shoot her or something?In the case of my book club, most of the Louise Penny fans were perfectly happy with the book, while others of us were less enthusiastic. Again, I recognize that Ms. Penny is a very talented writer, but I probably don't need to make a third visit to Three Pines."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36199787-jim", "userReview": "This is the third book in the Chief Inspector Armand Gamache series that I have read and it is the second in the series. It is fast becoming my favorite new series and I plan to read them in order. I don't think it is necessary to read the books in order but I think it will help to get to know Gamache, the members of his team, and most of all the quirky residents of the small village of Three Pines, Quebec.It is Christmas time in Three Pines but CC de Poitiers manages to alienate everyone she comes in contact with. Her husband, her daughter, and even the friendly and outgoing residents of Three Pines. She may be colder than the Quebec winter. So it should come as no surprise that when CC is electrocuted in the middle of a frozen lake, in front of the entire village, as she watched the annual curling tournament no one is grieving too much or that her shocking death was no accident.Inspector Gamache is called in to investigate. There is no shortage of potential suspects and the murder of a homeless woman in Montreal appears to have ties to both CC and Three Pines. Inspector Gamache's methods when investigating a murder are to talk with the residents. To get to know them (and so does the reader). The murder was not spontaneous. It was deliberate and planned. Only by talking with everyone will Gamache learn the events that led the murderer to commit this act. No one will every confuse Armand Gamache with Jack Reacher. I had a pretty good idea who the murderer was early on. It seemed somewhat obvious and I was pleased with myself that my deduction was correct. Even though I thought I knew who the murderer was this was a delightful read. It is approaching Christmas when I read this so that helped. We are in the midst of a \"polar vortex\" currently so I could relate to the author's description of the brutal winter weather. Three Pines is a fictional village but the description of it makes you wish it, and it's residents, were real. It would be nice to browse the bookstore and cozy up with a good book, sit in the bistro and enjoy a good meal and look out the windows at the lights of the village, and then head back to the B&B and your comfortable room. Almost makes winter sound pleasant. Almost. We are getting snow, sleet, and freezing rain as I write this and I know if I want to go anywhere I will have to warm up the car and scrape ice off the windows."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "Description: Welcome to winter in Three Pines, a picturesque village in Quebec, where the villagers are preparing for a traditional country Christmas, and someone is preparing for murder.No one liked CC de Poitiers.

CC de Poitiers managed to alienate everyone, right up until the moment of her death.When Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, is called to investigate, he quickly realizes he's dealing with someone quite extraordinary. CC de Poitiers was electrocuted in the middle of a frozen lake, in front of the entire village, as she watched the annual curling tournament. And yet no one saw anything. Who could have been insane enough to try such a macabre method of murder\u2014or brilliant enough to succeed?With his trademark compassion and courage, Gamache digs beneath the idyllic surface of village life to find the dangerous secrets long buried there. For a Quebec winter is not only staggeringly beautiful but deadly, and the people of Three Pines know better than to reveal too much of themselves. But other dangers are becoming clear to Gamache. As a bitter wind blows into the village, something even more chilling is coming for Gamache himself.Opening: Had CC de Poitiers known she was going to be murdered she might have bought her husband, Richard, a Christmas gift.

At first, I was disappointed. The initial chapters seemed to lose the edge established by the prior book, the returning characters from the village of Three Pines seemed far less interesting than before. Then Inspector Gamache came on the scene, late in my judgment, but once he made his appearance, the story took off, with an accelerating pace that lasted all the way through. The Three Pines characters, now seen through Gamache's eyes and not forced to make it on their own, regained their gloss. The plot is more than a little bizarre, and not quite believable in all aspects, but so what. It's a ripping story, thoroughly enjoyable. And author Penny clearly lays the basis for further intrigue in the career of Inspector Gamache, finally explaining the case that happened before Still Life and letting us know why there are some in the S\u00fbret\u00e9 who are out to get him."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "It is seldom the case for me to feel a happy contentment when opening up a book.

Louise Penny has become a firm favorite in the murder mystery genre and I just loved to be home in the Three Pines village of Quebec again with all the characters welcoming me. This time it was the day after Christmas, the deadly winter was raging, and more people would die than ever imagined. CC was a despised woman. Obnoxious, cruel, -she was maddeningly bad news- to the people who knew who she was, but did not reveal the secret. Well, CC died, electrocuted on a frozen lake while the entire village was there, curling, and Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, arrived in Three Pines again. The whosdunit was on!The book could well have been a novel about a small-town community without the murder mysteries to turn it into a picturesque magical, although imaginery, place.

Here it\u2019s the kind of weather when you find yourself stripped down to barely acceptable clothing and opening the fridge or freezer a little more often than necessary.

The village of Three Pines and its stubborn, gentle (and occasionally murderous) folk who insist on living in a place that would kill you if you ran out of firewood.Inspector Gamache has returned to Three Pines following another murder. This is the second of what is now a long series about this big, gentle, intellectual man and his various sidekicks and off-siders. He is welcomed back to the B & B, to the bistro, to the various easy chairs by the various fires. But he never loses sight of why he\u2019s there. He watches, he listens, and like me, he seems to suspect various possible perpetrators of the murder.I\u2019m not going to discuss the plot, other than to say that the unpleasant woman who was murdered was mourned by nobody, and her impending doom is mentioned in the first sentence. There are a few scary moments, but this is not a thriller. It is a just a good story told in good company.A cozy mystery, one might say, except that seems a little too light-weight for the quality of Penny\u2019s writing and the distinctiveness of her characters. She sets a scene better than most. I particularly liked the description of the church and its families.\u201cOn Christmas Eve St Thomas\u2019s was also filled with families, children excited and exhausted, elderly men and women who\u2019d come to this place all their lives and sat in the same pew and worshipped the same God and baptized and married and buried those they loved. Some they never got to bury, but instead immortalized in the small stained glass window placed to get the morning, the youngest, light. They marched now in warm yellows and blues and greens, for ever perfect and petrified in the Great War. Etched below the brilliant boys were their names and the words \u2018They Were Our Children\u2019.\u201dI\u2019ve given it 5 stars because I loved it. I don\u2019t need to tell you about the 3 old ladies (one of the \u201claundry hamper\u201d remark), the younger woman who was murdered, the widower and the practically catatonic daughter, the community curling festival on the frozen lake (where the murder took place), and the many village meals and conversations. So I won\u2019t. And I won\u2019t mention the sneaking-around backstabbing that seems to be going on behind our wonderful inspector over some previous case for which he\u2019s in the doghouse. Nope.

Canada is rarely featured in best-selling books, and to have it so celebrated is wonderful. It is Quebec, to be sure, but the Quebec of Anglo-culture, and so, it is the Canadian Quebec. Most powerful, for me, is the way she builds quiet characters of amazing strength and depth. These are not cartoon-brilliant people. They are, for the most part, fully-fleshed out, but rather ordinary people, for and around whom extraordinary events take place. I cared about them. And I love how she handles food. She herself talks about how the murder is really a conceit for the characters to reveal themselves - and their relationships. I think she has achieved this, and taken the mystery well beyond the procedural or the two-dimensional world of so many modern mysteries. She also has a reporter's eye for the compelling detail, and this effort, the research that has gone into the books, keep them from being too precious. There is a dense strong realism undergirding the story line. And she knows how to dose out the story, to keep you engaged. I also love the poet, the Ruth character, and her arc, through all the books, is amazing. As a reader, I at first disliked her, but she grew on me. I am not an expert, but Ruth's poetry resonates for me, I found it compelling, really powerful. I wish Penny would publish a book of poems by Ruth. I am looking forward to A Beautiful Mystery.

It\u2019s Christmas time in the quiet Quebec village and everyone is enjoying the festivities and an abundance of food and good will and neighbourly good deeds. The winter landscape plays an important part in the story as they cope with plummeting temperatures and outside conditions which threaten the life of the frail. We meet the eccentric and wonderfully portrayed characters we met in the first book, plus some newcomers including CC Poitiers, her shy husband and her nervous daughter. When CC Poitiers is murdered on the curling rink, one wintry morning, the whole village could have been a witness, yet they all claim to have seen nothing. The real stars of this book are the three Graces \u2013 three old women who have been friends forever and around whom this mystery seems to revolve. Everyone loves Gamache and is charmed by his calm temperament and determination to find the truth. However, there is a background mystery rumbling around, to do with an old case (the Arnot case) which keeps surfacing in this book but is never explained. Gamache is implicated and members of Gamache\u2019s team are also implicated in this case, which involved corrupt officers. I expect more will be revealed in later books in this series. The quality of the writing is great, as is the atmosphere and the plot. (The only tiny thing which didn\u2019t suit me were the massive amounts of food and drink which seemed to be in overabundant supply, and the author did rather go on about that aspect and the gourmet food on offer at the local brasserie \u2013 still, I know I am being picky when I point this out)."}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "I enjoyed this one slightly more than the 1st book in the series, and that gives me hope for the rest of them!

Problems gravitate to this tight-knit hamlet along with Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, a member of the S\u00fbret\u00e9. Once again, a woman was murdered and he was called in to locate the culprit. His team assisted him. I observed Inspector Beauvoir in action and learned a little more of his inner thoughts. Agent Lacoste returned to locate necessary facts about the case. Robert Lemieux, who made a brief show in the first story, entered the fold. And the strange Yvette Nichol was back. Mother Bea, Kaye and Em and their relationship with the victim, CC Poitier, appeared to be the center of A Fatal Grace. CC: a woman that was selfish, abusive and just plain mean-spirited. She was someone you wouldn't want as your neighbor and yet she bought the one available home house that was up for sale for a cheap price in Three Pines. I have to comment on several things. First of all, the cold. It is safe to say that the author understood a wickedly fierce winter and, in an indirect manner, her descriptions of the fiendish algidity matched the victim. Gamache was coughing and trying to catch his breath. It was like inhaling acid. Beauvoir didn't know what was worse, the shriek of the alarm or the shriek of the ground as though the earth itself was crying out in pain with every step they took.Then there was the way CC was murdered; it was different than anything I have read before. Kudos to Ms. Penny for an ingenious idea. I enjoyed witnessing cracks in several relationships amongst the townspeople; it made an interesting human relationship spin. Food was mentioned because everyone likes to eat, right? Strong coffee with brunch, buttered croissants and wedges of cheese, thick soup with rolls and dessert...food served a purpose: love -or lack of it- and energy. A Fatal Grace had a few bumps and lumps, some areas that drifted (no pun intended!) and several subplots that I am sure will come to fruition in other stories. I look forward to visiting with Armand again."}, {"userName": "Kate Olson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13650342-kate-olson", "userReview": "I adore this series SO MUCH.

Curling, by the way, refers to a winter sport played in Canada, not to a hairdressing activity.CC was completely unpopular. She was extremely mean and had delusions of grandeur. No one liked her. This meant that there were many suspects.CC purchased the old Hadley house on the hill (the site of the last murder). She bought the house for a song, because no one would touch it, given its history. She lived there with her withdrawn, overweight daughter, Cri, and her passive husband, Richard Lion. Neither of them liked CC much, since she was abusive to both of them, especially the child.CC also had a lover, Saul Petrov, who was doing photographs of her for her business. Saul and CC despised each other too. Penny brings back most of the cast of characters from the previous book. This includes, of course, the elegant and kind hearted Chief Inspector Armand Gamache himself, from the Montreal Surete. He is surrounded by his usual sidekicks, Jean-Guy Beauvoir (his right hand man) and much of his previous team, including Agent Isabelle LaCoste and even, unexpectedly, the unpleasant Agent Yvette Nichol. There is a new team member, Robert Lemieux. There is also Gamache's beloved wife, Reine-Marie.We've also got most of the Three Pines townies from the last book. They are a varied lot, artistic and bohemian. There's the surly elderly alcholic Ruth Zardo, whose insulting persona hides a fine poetess, and a very capable woman. There are Clara and Peter, the artist couple; and Myrna, the flamboyant large black woman who is a former psychologist turned bookseller. Gay couple Gavri and Olivier, owners of the local B & B and purveyors of antiques, turn up also. There are also a new group of women (new to this series, not to Three Pines), the \"Three Graces\". These are three elderly ladies, Kay, Em, and Beatrice (aka \"Mother\" or \"B\"). \"Mother\" ran the local yoga and meditation center, called \"Be Calm\". Em owned a dog, Henri.As usual with Penny, the books goes into the characters and their inner lives in depth. In this one, she deals more with their individual spiritual experiences, which contrast with the shallow New Age \"spirituality\" of CC.Anyway, we see the courage of the investigators and the townspeople. Gamache and Beauvoir rush into a burning building to save someone as townspeople fight the fire outside in the brutal Quebec winter. In another scene, Gamache and some locals snowmobile over an icy lake in a blizzard to save a few locals.As usual with Penny, the book is bittersweet. There are losses, but her writing also affirms the sweetness of love, friendship, food, kindness, and spiritual understanding.Scenes of heroism are juxtaposed with lovely descriptions of delicious meals, warm fireplaces, Christmas gifts, etc.It's just the right mix of fear, tension, sadness, and sweetness.And Louise Penny does not fall into the pit that many writers of series enter. Every book she does is fresh and original. I haven't read one yet that feels formulaic.Ralph Cosham does a wonderful job of reading these audios.As I already mentioned, I'm really looking forward to reading the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "This review has been revised and can now be found at Expendable Mudge Muses Aloud."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "My second Armand Gamache book, and I\u2019m still very impressed with Penny\u2019s abilities. I really like Gamache as a character\u2014he\u2019s easy to identify with. As a reader, I was happy to see him succeed in his investigation.Just like Agatha Christie, Penny has chosen a small community as her setting. A place where people know each other well enough to make a plot line like this one work. Solving this crime in a big city would be a much different proposition, much more difficult. Part of the charm in these books is the way that the townspeople interact among themselves and their acceptance of Gamache.I had a few frustrations that had nothing to do with the writing! Pages were missing from the library copy that I borrowed, 2 pages from the middle of the book, and the last 3 pages were gone. By that point, the killer and their motive were already revealed, so I just missed the denouement, but it was most annoying. Being a series, there are ongoing concerns that I can only imagine were addressed in the dying paragraphs of the book. I am assured, however, that Penny makes everything clear in each volume, so I have no doubt I\u2019ll be able to pick up book 3 and still be able to appreciate what\u2019s going on.So, adieu for now, Armand Gamache.

Few have had much to say about it other than giving it 4-5 stars. This could be due to its publication date, perhaps a bit pre-GR or just that it's a good mystery and that's that. I could immediately see Penny's growth as a writer. I found it far better plotted and much more engaging than the first in the series. From what I'm hearing they just keep getting better which is wonderful news.As with the first, the story takes place in the fictional, small town of Three Pines, Quebec. Continuing characters return making it seem like a visit with people you are getting to know. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache is seeking the killer of a CC dePoitiers, a woman detested by almost everyone in thecommunity. She is so disliked that not many truly mourn her passing but still the murderer must be found. C C has been offed in a most unusual way, electrocution at an outdoor curling match at Christmas time. This in itself is part of the fun of solving the mystery. I listened to A Fatal Grace. This had its pros and cons. Certainly the Blackstone Audio narration by Ralph Cosham is a plus. His pronunciation of the French and his accent made the whole experience much more enjoyable for me. A minus is that it was difficult to bookmark wonderful passages or phrasing to keep and share. This often necessitates acquiring the physical book and searching to find the specific words for quote. Consider this passage which takes place on Christmas Eve at St. Thomas Church described as filled with greenery and light and beautiful singing.'All is calm, the voice sang, rescuing the sinking congregation. Clara turned, trying to find the child. Many were also craning to see who was leading them. Even Gavri was forced to relinquish his place in the unexpected and not totally welcome presence of the divine. It was as though an angel, as Yeats would have it, became weary of the whimpering dead and chose this lively company.Clara suddenly had a perfect view.There at the back stood CC dePoitiers wearing a fluffy white sweater made of either cashmere or kittens Beside her was her husband, florid and mute. And beside him an enormous child was wearing a sleeveless sundress of the brightest pink. Her underarms bulged and flopped and the rolls of her waist made the skin tight dress look like a melting strawberry ice cream. It was grotesque.But her face was beautiful.\"I quote this passage as the singer is Cree, CC's daughter, a horribly awkward child who is often the recipient of her mother's venomous tongue and this time is no exception. To Cree's singing, CC states:\"You're a stupid, stupid girl\". Everyone was staring at you. You humiliated me\" This illustrates beautifully CC's overall personality and why she is so disliked. Penny seems to have many central themes in her books, music, religion, faith, art, small town politics, secrets; all with a touch of humor and love. In addition there are the characters, both charming and unlikeable making for a good read. Penny's Chief Inspector Armand Gamache Novels might be considered cozies. I'm not certain. There's a bit more here than what I consider cozy but not enough that would leave out those that can't tolerate heavy violence. I guess they are somewhat Agatha Christie like with lots of suspects, red herrings and a murderer who is revealed by books end. There's a touch of the f word if that bothers you.A good argument for \"not\" is given by Beth Kanell, author of her own New England Mysteries Series and co-owner with her husband Dave, of Kingdom Books in Would You Say a Louise Penny Book Is a \"Cozy\" Mystery? I Say It's NOT! As for CC, she is so vile that even I found her despicable but I didn't kill her.

Mostly I just enjoyed being in this novel and experiencing Three Pines at Christmas (incidentally, Louise, will your characters be tipping the scales at >300lbs a few books down the line? The food!). The murder in this case is one of the most convoluted I've come across. She had me guessing throughout and I had changed my mind several times and was ultimately wrong (no great feat fooling me though :/ ).That's the great thing about being into a novel like this. It's in your head all the time, suspecting that all the clues are there for you; you keep thinking back on it, trying to make sense of it all.This goes for all mystery novels, I'm sure. But there's more to the mystery with Penny's books. It's all about the characters, and the setting. That is what really has me hooked so far. That, and the unanimous assertion that this series \"really takes off\" in scope by book 4.Well, if this is in fact the case (and judging by the ratings, it's pretty much a certainty), I'm still really happy that I've discovered this fine writer.A Fatal Grace, on its own, probably would score a 3.5. But it is but a blip in the grand scheme of things so as a continuance from Still Life (which I loved), I'm rating it a solid 4 stars.Off for another little break now, and I'll be back in Three Pines, very soon."}, {"userName": "Kirsten ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten", "userReview": "Well, it'd been so long since I read book #1, I forgot what all the fuss was about the first time.

You could almost feel how cold it was there in the remote Quebec village. The strange underlying conspiracy plotline is a little confusing, but I'm sure it'll be explained in later books."}], "description": "Welcome to winter in Three Pines, a picturesque village in Quebec, where the villagers are preparing for a traditional country Christmas, and someone is preparing for murder.No one liked CC de Poitiers. Not her quiet husband, not her spineless lover, not her pathetic daughter\u2014and certainly none of the residents of Three Pines. CC de Poitiers managed to alienate everyone, right up until the moment of her death. When Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, is called to investigate, he quickly realizes he's dealing with someone quite extraordinary. CC de Poitiers was electrocuted in the middle of a frozen lake, in front of the entire village, as she watched the annual curling tournament. And yet no one saw anything. Who could have been insane enough to try such a macabre method of murder\u2014or brilliant enough to succeed?With his trademark compassion and courage, Gamache digs beneath the idyllic surface of village life to find the dangerous secrets long buried there. For a Quebec winter is not only staggeringly beautiful but deadly, and the people of Three Pines know better than to reveal too much of themselves. But other dangers are becoming clear to Gamache. As a bitter wind blows into the village, something even more chilling is coming for Gamache himself.", "title": "Dead Cold\n      \n          (Chief Inspector Armand Gamache #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13624880.Dead_Cold__Chief_Inspector_Armand_Gamache___2_", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1352689740l/13624880.jpg", "reviews": 3911, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/194243.Louise_Penny", "name": "Louise Penny"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Cultural", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13624880-dead-cold", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352921.A_Fatal_Grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8578293-a-fatal-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12499719-dead-cold", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9648240-a-fatal-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6483060-a-fatal-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7723463-a-fatal-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3393657-a-fatal-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338691.Still_Life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17167084-how-the-light-gets-in", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7945049-bury-your-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2277378.The_Cruelest_Month", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4201106-a-rule-against-murder"]}
