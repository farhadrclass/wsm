Was. Epic!!! My gawd, I love this author. I have never enjoyed flesh eating zombies so damn much before.  This is the story of Galen & Holly (which was told entirely from Galen's POV-sooo much fun!). High school sweethearts enjoying just being teenagers. Galen's home life is far from perfect which is why he spends most of his time at Holly's, where her parents treat him like family (more than his own mother does). Everything is just about perfect, til one morning they wake up to....\n Over the crest of the hill comes a horde of rotten things, spilling down the streets in a sea of broken skin, dirty clothes, blood, bones, flesh. I see things I've never seen before spilling from the abdomens of human bodies, splattering the ground.\n All of the sudden, they find themselves smack in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. But these are no ordinary zombies. Sure there are the normal walking dead type called the 'DeadBorn', but there's also fire breathing, acid spitting, flying demon types along for the ride as well as many more. Thousands of them, all with only one thing in common -they are all looking for Holly. Holly has been having dreams of all this happening but never ever thought it would actually happen. This only scratches the surface of the plot, there are quite a few surprising, scary, and disgusting twists along the way. It was all very wicked and gruesome. The action starts almost immediately and DOES. NOT. STOP. But the characters really bring it all to life.\nI wonder if we're becoming co-dependent and decide that I really don't give a shit either way.\n Holly & Galen stick to each others sides through it all. If one moves, so does the other. I loved the strength of Holly's character. She was the strong one, the leader, the one who kept as level a head as possible -all things considered, and Galen was the screamer Lol. But they balanced each other out, which was nice. It was odd finding such a sweet romance in the middle of all the gore, but it worked fantastically.\n the girl who never gives up, no matter the circumstances. She's a fighter, my Holly.\n I have to give a shoutout to Martin with his 'zombie apocalypse survival guide' and his walking dead, I heart Daryl t-shirt. I LOVED that kid!! But seriously, another brilliant piece of work by C.M. Stunich. This woman is a hard core creep-show master. Grungy, dirty, gross, and completely unique."}, {"userName": "Veronica LaRoche", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16226703-veronica-laroche", "userReview": "This was a crazy insane read that I didn\u2019t want too stop reading.

This book has everything: magic, zombies, apocalypse,even a beautiful love story; all the ingredients to make a good book. I\u2019m happy I read this book, it\u2019s awesome, and the writer has a great imagination that will throw you right into the story and makes you eager to fight zombies. And now I know what to do if zombies will take over the world.The story starts with a boy names Galen who had a rough life with his father passing away and his mother making him do all sorts of things that he hated. One day, when his mother has another book club, he runs throw the window to his girlfriend Holly Arget. He is threaten at her house like he is family, and there is his shelter, but the important thing is that he loves Holly. She is the tip of girl who is incredible smart and powerful, more brave than he his and a girl who can handle a baseball bat and a gun. A girl you wound\u2019t want to mess with.The night he stayed over, Holly dreamed had a dream that a necromancer will make zombies walk the earth and that Galen will die. That night was the beginning of the apocalypse. \u201eTo have the luxury of tears, we have to live.\u201d They start running and killing as much zombies as they could, but people start dying and there is nothing they can do. Holly tries to change her dream and thinks to run at Glean\u2019s house with Dawson- her ex boyfriend, and with Martin- a colleague of Glean who in the middle of war wears a T-shirt with Walking Dead. The strange thing is that no one seems to know about the zombie attack, no news about it, anything, but Glen\u2019s mother is missing and there is no signal, everything is weird. \u201cI'm thinking that you're the only person in the world that I'd want to get stuck in a zombie apocalypse with.\u201d I try to smile, but my words aren't funny and the expression dies away as quick as it came. \u201cI believe that if anyone could save us that it'd be you, and I think I'm about as useful as a twig when it comes to fighting those things.\u201d All four of them try to run away from Watercrest, but on the high way they are surrounded by DeadBorn\u2019s and the necromancer- Patricia- who has her powers out of control and can perfectly control the zombies. They barely manage to escape and try to find a way to get to the refuge office that Holly\u2019s knows. The problems are starting to get to all of them, and Dawson it\u2019s starting to act whiteout thinking. Too much it\u2019s happening to fast.This book it\u2019s amazing, I read it in one sitting! It\u2019s full of action and the characters are becoming more responsible from one page to another. The story it\u2019s told from Galen point of view but you can see that Holly is the one that controls everything, she is the powerful one. I can\u2019t imagine how she could carry all the problems on her shoulders and still face up to what was coming. I loved it! You should read it!!! You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing!"}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13706669-toni", "userReview": "Actual rating: 4.5/5Review & giveaway part of #zOctober2013 on My Book Addiction!There is no better way to describe this book than to say it\u2019s all kinds of dark, twisted, intense zombie awesomesauce! It begins with Galen sitting in his bedroom thinking about how much he loathes his home life. He decides to sneak out his window and head to his girlfriend\u2019s house just as his mom is summoning him to help entertain her friends. At Holly\u2019s house he feels normal. Her parents treat him like one of the family.. like the family he wishes he had. But don\u2019t get too emotional, the rainbows and Rice Krispies Treats don\u2019t last that long. In fact, they turn into something truly horrifying that is sure to give you nightmares! Galen wakes up early the following morning to find that Holly is no longer in bed. He begins to search for her and realizes she is outside in her pajamas staring off into the distance. Yeah, that\u2019s not strange or anything. When he reaches her side he looks out to see what she is gazing at, but at that moment I bet he wishes he would have stayed in bed. It\u2019s time to get the hell out of dodge, buddy boy!Deadborn came out of the brilliant, yet completely twisted mind of one of my now favorite authors. C.M. Stunich has got it going on, my friends! This isn\u2019t simply a book about zombies. No, this is also chock-full of lava-spewing demons, creepy ass water hags, a necromancer and a super awesome cast of \u201creal\u201d characters, too. Not long after the story began, I started holding my breath and I can\u2019t even tell you how long it was until I let it out. This is non-stop action that is truly scary enough to make you crap your pants. Every noise I heard in the dark while reading frayed my nerves. This is definitely NOT the zombie apocalypse I want to be caught in the middle of, should the day ever come. But this is one of the most insane zombie books I\u2019ve ever read. My head didn\u2019t stop spinning for days after finishing it.Normally you get a first person view straight from the main characters mind or a third person view about the main character, but I found it extremely unique that Holly was the main focus of the story told from Galen\u2019s POV. Stunich also managed to fit a very natural feeling love story in the middle of all the insanity. I told you, she\u2019s the shiznit! I was a tad bummed that Holly lost some of her quirky personality we got a glimpse of in the beginning. I understand the reasoning, but I feel like the parts of her character that I anticipated fawning over and chuckling about were lost for a while. It didn\u2019t change the fact that I freaking LOVE this book, though.I highly recommend Deadborn to all fans of horror, zombies, and urban fantasy. If you\u2019re tired of the same old zombie apocalypse scenario, this is the book for you!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Arrowood", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18180529-elizabeth-arrowood", "userReview": "This book was fantastic. I don't normally read zombie apocalypse books, and I'll admit that I was a bit put off at first because of this, but I really got sucked in after a couple of chapters.This is a way different take on zombies. WAY different. C.M. Stunich, how do you do it?!?!? Such an amazing imagination, I've loved every single book that I've read. So, at first, I was put off. Why? Because I felt that the beginning/introductions to the characters was a bit rushed and kinda forced, and then we just jumped right into the action.I was confused, and not as attached as I like to be, but the more the story developed, the more you understood and grew to love the characters. The zombies, man. This was creepy/scary/disturbing and flat out horrific. And there was much more than zombies afoot. Like I said, I don't know how the author thinks this stuff up. What really tripped me up were the young ones, the babies. Surprisingly enough, though, it didn't repulse me enough to make me want to stop reading. In fact, I felt for each and everyone of those undead people. It was just kind of sad.On the characters: just to get this off of my chest- Dawson is the type of guy that you hope dies first in a horror movie just so he'll shut the hell up and stop making things more difficult. And even still, by the end, I was rooting for him not just to survive, but to be happy too. Valerie was great. She was unexpected and grounded everybody when they were losing their minds. I liked her a lot.Holly, this is where I would've really liked more time to get to know a character before all the crazy happens, but- her character was believable and strong and at the same time quite vulnerable. She took on a sense of responsibility and determination right from the get-go. It was admirable, and she only let herself break down in privacy and in the hands of the man she loves: Galen.This story was told from Galen's point of view, with no switch ups, for which I'm glad because I think if there were multiple point if views, I would've been completely confused. Galen is gentle and innocent, not afraid to let his girl take the lead and to be her rock when she needs strength. I think that he was my favorite. Despite being vulnerable and feeling lost and scared, he pushed on and didn't lose hope. He had faith in Holly and refused to lose sight of the future- one without zombies.The plot was just sad. Good, but sad. So many people died. All for what? A selfish psychopath angry at the world. Having said that, hell, I'd be angry too. This is a great stand alone C.M. Stunich novel, and definitely a worthwhile read for most anyone."}, {"userName": "S.

It gripped me from the start and I was honestly surprised to find the main character was a male and not a female. Galen comes off as really a no self esteem whiner throughout most of the book, but he eventually finds his back bone. Holly however is kick ass. If ever there was a zombie apocalypse I'd absolutely want her on my side.The story is very fast paced and once it gets its claws into the reader, it will not allow itself to be closed until its story its told. As I write this it's almost five in the morning that's how good the story is.However, there are several errors that were more than likely \"lost in the moment\" encountered. A few of them forced me to read a sentence more than once to figure out exactly what was being portrayed. However good the story is, because of the amount of errors I found, which really shocked me since I found no errors in First, I can not honestly give this book the 5 paws the story itself deserves.I give this book 4 of 5 paws\n\n\n\nReviewed by S.Cu'Anam PolicarFreaky Fiction Writing AuthorCu's Ebook Giveaways OwnerFae Books Tour Host/ReviewerGirls <3 Books Tours HostLadyAmber's Book Tours HostB3 Book Tours HostI Am A Reader Not A Writer Blog Tour HostShades of Rose Marketing Tour HostGWR Tour HostAs You Wish Tour Host"}, {"userName": "Helena", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9995733-helena", "userReview": "Wow! From the first few chapters on this book is nonstop action, which I suppose isn't much of a surprise with any book involves zombies. Still, the action in this book was unlike most other zombie books I've read in the past. There was a lot more going on than just a simple reanimation of the dead. There's DeadBorn that spit magma, ones that spit acid, there's skeletons with no ligaments left to even hold their bones together, there's ones that fly like angels, there's mummies... There's really a little bit of everything in this book. It truly puts another spin on a simple \"End of the World\" story. Holly is a total badass and I loved her as a character. She was able to face a legion of demons and zombies while keeping a strong face - hardly showing much fear. The same could not be said of Galen, the main character, who happens to be Holly's boyfriend. Although in the end he's a stronger man, he starts out fairly weak. I normally dislike a weak main character, but it does bring in some more realistic qualities. So many zombie novels have these super strong badass leads, but how many people would actually react that way? Personally? I'd be freakin' terrified. All the same, I couldn't help but think that the story may have been better told if Holly was the lead. This is mostly because I would have love to have some insight into Holly's dreams and thought process while she she was making these hard decisions to try to keep the group alive.This is definitely a fun book. It's a bit different than other books I've read by this author, but still a great time!"}, {"userName": "Annmarie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12689982-annmarie", "userReview": "Prologue begins Ten Minutes Before...the outbreak.Story begins Ten Hours Before \u2026the outbreak.The outbreak lasted three days.Main characters: Galen and Holly, Dawson and Martin.

Holly knew the necromancer was coming but she is unsure as to why. Holly has no idea why the necromancer chose her. Holly wants to find the necromancer and kill her. The group of teenagers are waiting around at a wildlife refuge for the necromancer to find Holly.It's creative. The author has a unique imagination with the creation of the creatures.

StunichI ABSOLUTELY love all books by C.M. Stunich! The way her mind works is amazing! No story is like any I've ever read and that holds true to Deadborn.This story is from Galen's point of view. I love that it's written from a guys POV, but I will warn you... he's not this amazing hero. Nope that's his girlfriend Holly's job.Glan is sleeping over at Holly's when he wakes up to find her not in bed. Instead he finds her standing outside in the middle of the street. When he goes down stairs to find out what's going on, she says \" I had a dream...\" and then there are hoards of deadborns running for them, the only catch.... they don't harm Holly, just everyone else....They take off towards Holly's ex's house..... As soon as they get there, all they have time to do is grab bag of guns, ammo, and clothes before they have to move somewhere else.Holly decides the wildlife refuge is the best place to go and stay and wait it out, but they never expected things to change the way they did.So are they doomed or do Holly and Galen live to tell the story or the deadborn?

Stunich, obviously I love reading any book by her. Deadborn first attracted me with its gorgeous cover, then that it was about ZOMBIES!!! I love zombies, but this was not your typical zombie story. I wouldn't even call it a post- apocalyptic zombie read, I feel like it was more of a paranormal read.i loved reading about all of the different types of \"zombies\" and how they interacted with each other and their individual attributes. The only thing that I found a. Little confusing was the whole Holly and Patricia relationship. I wish that I had more background on them and their situations. Holly was kick ass! I probably wouldn't have been as brave as her in that situation. I just want to know more about her. Why did she keep so much from the others for so long? When did she realize that the visions were real? And so much more. I love the name Galen!!! So HOT!! I love that he was a strong male character he had no idea how to act when the zombies arrived, therefore he let Holly take the lead which would be hard for any male haha. I'm glad their relationship could stay strong through everything. I want to know what will happen now!I would recommend this book to zombie lovers and C.M. fans.

I felt like the story with the mother was a little loose. Either develop it more (99% of their time was spent figuring out how to kill & avoid different creatures) or drop that angle.
