He\u2019s elected to \u201cre-up\u201d to help his brothers-in-arms to defeat the enemies of the state\u2026 both zombies and others.The narration for this and both other books was done by Chris Patton. Like the other 2, the narration in this was perfect. He is the perfect voice for Cade and the other characters that are involved in all the books. Patton does a superb job keeping up with the pacing of the book, speeding up when he needs to and taking it a little slower when it\u2019s called for.The first two books in the Surviving The Zombie Apocalypse series: Trudge and Soldier On were both action throughout \u2014 Trudge needed some set up in the beginning but then quickly sped up. Soldier On was beginning to end action with a lot happening to move the story forward. With In Harm\u2019s Way, I could tell that Chesser was looking for a way to explain what was going to happen in the next books and with the series. Technically it could have ended in book 2 with a relatively happy ending, but to continue he needed to turn the story a bit. I think that\u2019s what is happening with book 3.Don\u2019t get me wrong, In Harm\u2019s way is still a great post-apocalyptic/zombie novel, it was just a total off-speed pitch in comparison to the other two. I 100% understand why Chesser did what he did and I don\u2019t fault him for it at all. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really talk about the choices that he made to continue the story because it will involve major spoilers. Let\u2019s just say I can\u2019t wait to see what happens in book 4.Some of the technology that is included really peaked my interest. I\u2019m sure that there either is something like what he described today, and if it\u2019s not I\u2019m betting it\u2019s in the pipeline for the near future.The characters are incredibly well described, and some of the new ones gave me chills when certain things happened. (It\u2019s really hard not to give away too much). I am eagerly awaiting for Chesser and Patton to team up for the rest of the series because I need to figure out what happens to Cade, his family, and the others.Like this review?

There is no cure. There is little to no chance that anyone who has made it just over a week will continue to live for much longer. Cade Grayson has been reunited with his wife and daughter just in time for the new President to ask Cade to re-up to help fight against the new enemies of the state \u2013 the zombies and others.Narration for In Harm\u2019s Way was done by Chris Patton. If you are familiar with the series, you know that Patton has narrated the other two books in this series too. He is the perfect voice for Cade and the other characters. A little raspy and manly, the voice fits Cade\u2019s character perfectly. The production quality was perfect; I didn\u2019t notice any issues or problems with speed or anything else.Trudge and Soldier on were fast-paced books. Especially Soldier On. I remember reading that and barely taking a chance to eat or sleep. In Harm\u2019s Way was a little bit of a changeup compared to those two books because Chesser decided to take his time and provide an incredibly details explanation of what was going on in the world outside of Cade and the other soldiers little \u201cbubble.\u201dWhile this change in speed wasn\u2019t expected by me, I still really enjoyed the story the Chesser wrote. The direction he is taking this series makes me happy and I think that book 4 will be right back at the bang-bang-bang speed that I was used to.Overall, this was still a great zombie book \u2013 just be prepared for a slight slowdown. Chesser finds a way with every book to leave me begging for more, and he\u2019s done it again.Audiobook was provided for review by the author."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Lunsford", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14783992-stephanie-lunsford", "userReview": "this Series is a must read! I love that Shawn has a main character Cade but the book also follows other characters in important missions or meetings. I couldn't put it down! I had to know what would happen next in this book... Shawn is great a putting in those cliffhangers in there to keep you on the edge of your seat as you read through the books. if you love Action, Blood, gore, Zombies, & military maneuvers then this is the book for you! the way he describes how the Cade has the Zombie in his sniper scope from 300 yards & how he aims right between the left eye & left ear & he squeezes the trigger....."}, {"userName": "Jessica Kong", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12752266-jessica-kong", "userReview": "In Harm's Way, Book 3 in Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse, is definitely an attention grabber. Once you start reading, you can't stop, for several reasons. The characters are so real, you wish you can reach for their necks . There were some instances where if some commonsense was used events could have been avoided. I'm not crazy about how some individuals were brilliant and capable in one scene then they were downright stupid and 'doe in the headlights' in another. Really? Does that really happen? The lack of consistency in character traits need some help. I liked the storyline, but some events should never have happened if the characters had remained true to themselves."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "Much the same as other series in this genre. We have at least three sets of survivors to follow around as they make their way to safety, other family members, or the military fighting the undead due to the Omega virus. As was the previous volumes this book is a little long-of-tooth in the story telling department. Although the last few chapters did improve and show promise. As I said of book two the story is not terrible, it's just a bit tedious at times and perhaps could be reduced in volume somewhat.

The books keep getting better and this is a page turner for sure!! The author has a few groups of the opportunistic survivors being much more of a threat than the zombies! Imagine that!

It seems Chesser spent more time with character development with this book. In the previous books in this series, most of the character got killed before the reader got to know them.

Outbreak - Day 8 After running and gunning across much of the western U.S., Cade Grayson, former Delta Force operator, is finally reunited with his wife Brook and daughter Raven. Hours after arriving at the relative safety of Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, the new Capital of the United States, Cade is approached by the new President, Valerie Clay. Her request is simple: she appeals to the patriot in him to rejoin the Unit that he left for civilian life fifteen months prior and once more go into harm's way, taking the fight to the enemy. Meanwhile, Duncan Winters, Vietnam-era aviator, finds himself stranded in Springs along with BLM firefighter Daymon Bush. Both men arrived with Cade and were promised transport back to Eden, Utah. Duncan longs to be reunited in Eden with his brother Logan, a survivalist/ Doomsday prepper. Daymon, with no surviving family, knows only one thing for certain: he doesn't want to remain trapped behind the wire inside of a huge government-run military base. Mere days after Washington D.C. is overrun and the sitting President goes missing, Robert Christian, billionaire kingmaker who has been waiting in the wings for a world-changing event such as this, marshals his group of mercenaries led by former Navy SEAL Ian Bishop. Their mission: to control what remains of the United States by any means necessary and ultimately reshape the country to fit their warped vision for a new world order. Will Cade accept President Clay's overture and embark on a new high priority mission alongside his friend and mentor, Delta Commander General Mike Desantos? Will Brook Grayson continue to hone her newly found survival skills and successfully train her eleven-year-old daughter Raven to defend herself against the undead threat? Will Captain Ronnie Gaines and his SF soldiers from Fort Kit Carson succeed in clearing downtown Springs of the zombie menace? Will Duncan and Daymon survive their flight from Schriever Air Force Base and find the survivalist group in Eden? Can the human race survive what appears to be its final extinction level event?", "title": "In Harm's Way\n      \n          (Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse #3)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23173847-in-harm-s-way", "average": 4.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474478726l/23173847.jpg", "reviews": 38, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5095036.Shawn_Chesser", "name": "Shawn Chesser"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13694050.Monique_Lewis", "name": "Monique  Lewis"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23173847-in-harm-s-way", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28950524-in-harm-s-way", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18951776-in-harm-s-way", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15716062-in-harm-s-way", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23338453-trudge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24810926-a-pound-of-flesh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22597115-warpath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24533815-mortal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23338452-soldier-on"]}
