I knew of it but nothing more.So, imagine how surprised I currently am that I enjoyed this book to a five star level. I have to return it to the library even though I don't want to. There is so much to unpack. There is so much for me to soak in. This book has it all, from raw and heartfelt depictions of African American's lives (past and present), to the celebration of blackness and a thriving life against all odds. I'm afraid I don't have the adequate words to do this book justice.

In the collection, Grimes pays homage to poets from the Harlem Renaissance (some well-know, others less familiar) by presenting their poems and then writing her own \"Golden Shovel poem\" using either the HR poet's entire poem or a line from their poem as inspiration. The catch, Grimes has to end each of her lines with the original poet's words in sequence. Here's an example: The line she selected from \"The Minor Key\" by Clara Ann Thompson reads, \"A thousand hearts echo the sigh.\" So Grimes writes,Anger is a hard itch to scratch; laughter asecret tickle we let out in a thousandsneezes, sometimes to camouflage cracked hearts;love, envy, fear -- we all hear their echo.Peel us to the core, we're all indistinguishable. Press thesolar plexus of any, you'll hear the selfsame sigh. (p. 92)So beautiful...and genius, really, because each of Grimes's poems captures not only the tone of the original poem, but also the heart of its meaning. (And she regularly does this with the text of ENTIRE POEMS. Incredible.) The stories her poems tell provide contemporary narratives while simultaneously revealing how relevant the poems from the Harlem Renaissance continue to be today in their original form. And the artwork: all by currently working African-American illustrators. Although my copy is an ARC and only includes a couple of full color illustrations, it's clear that this is going to be a breathtakingly beautiful book.The collection is published for middle grade and YA readers, but it's really for everyone."}, {"userName": "Laura Harrison", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2531602-laura-harrison", "userReview": "Absolutely wonderful.

Art, dance, music, poetry, all artistic and cultural forms flourished during this time and Harlem became a mecca for African American artists.Calling on some of the great poets of the Harlem Renaissance, Nikki Grimes has created an anthology of poems as only she can. She has paired some of the best poems by masters as Langston Hughes, Jean Toomer and Countee Cullen with poems of her own, but she has taken the pairing one step further and used a poetic form called the Golden Shovel, a form created to honor poet Gwendolyn Brooks.A poet using Golden Shovel takes one or more lines from a poem and places the chosen words vertically in the right hand column. These words from the original poem become the last words of each line of poetry in the new poem. Let me give you an example of Golden Shovel from One Last Word:Storm Ending by Jean ToomerThunder blossoms gorgeously above our heads,Great, hollow, bell-like flowers,Rumbling in the wind,Stretching clappers to strike our ears...Full-lipped flowersBitten by the sunBleeding rainDripping rain like golden honey -And the sweet earth flying from the thunder.Using the highlighted words from Toomer's poem, Grimes created this poem:Truthby Nikki GrimesThe truth is, every day we rise is like thunder -a clap of surprise. Could be echoes of trouble, or blossomsof blessing. You never know what garish or gorgeouslydisguised memories-to-be might rain down from above.So, look up! Claim that cloud with the silver lining. Ourjob, if you ask me, is to follow it. See where it heads.Grimes begins this volume with an original poem of her own that asks the question so many young people of color must be asking themselves today: how does one stay strong in a world where fear and hate are right outside the door? Each poem by the leading poets of the Harlem Renaissance is arranged somewhat thematically around this question, placed side by side with a contemporary poem by Grimes, all age appropriate and relevant to today young readers. And Grimes ends with another original poem that answers her opening question not with a pat answer but with a vision of hope. Two beautiful poems connected to each other by shared words across time and space.One Last Word is a skillfully crafted homage to these great African American poets and the glory days of the Harlem Renaissance, a tribute to the heroes of poetry that influenced Nikki Grimes's development as a daring and original poet, who like her predecessors, is a voice and interpreter of her times.Each poem has an accompanying illustration by some of today's best African American artists. Each illustration is done it the artists preferred medium and has a style of its own, giving the artwork the same sense of individuality that the poems.Be sure to read both the front and back matter. There is short introduction to the Harlem Renaissance, as well as a more detailed description of the poetry form used and an Author's Note. Back matter includes biographies of the poets Grimes chose for this volume and the artists who contributed to it. Grimes has also included the sources she consulted to make One Last Word the incredible volume poetry it is.This book is recommended for readers age 10+This book was an EARC received from NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Brandi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25537717-brandi", "userReview": "Nikki Grimes's \"One Last Word: Wisdom from the Harlem Renaissance\" is an exceptional reference book for history and literature classes.

There are so many things I love about this book of poems. In the preface, she describes the Harlem Renaissance, the various art forms and talents that came from that place and time, and how they directly impacted her life and career. Wanting to pay tribute to the many brilliant authors who inspired her, she chose to do so using a form of poetry called The Golden Shovel which takes words from an existing poem and uses them to create a new poem. Seeing the resulting works gave me a new appreciation for Grimes\u2019 mastery of words. Beautiful works from poets such as Langston Hughes, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Gwendolyn Bennet and others are featured alongside Grimes\u2019 heart-felt, thought-provoking and masterfully crafted works. In addition to the beautiful poems, several artists are highlighted with their stunning colorful images displayed throughout. The resource section in the back gives biographical information on all the poets and artists whose works are used in the book.

After sharing the original poem, she follows it with one of her own. All of Grimes' poems are written in the poetry form Golden Shovel.The idea of a Golden Shovel poem is to take a short poem in its entirety, or a line from that poem (called a striking line), and create a new poem, using the words from the original.The framework for this poetry collection is a brother and sister discouraged by watching the news come to find hope and inspiration from reading poetry from the Harlem Renaissance. The introductory poem asks, \"Can I really find fuel for the future in the past?\" In the last poem, we return to the framework. He has found his answer: \"The past is a ladder that can help you keep climbing.\"The collection includes poems from Gwendolyn Bennett, Countee Cullen, William Waring Cuney, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Langston Hughes, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Clara Ann Thompson, and Jean Toomer. (Biographies for each poet can be found in the back matter.)My thoughts: I really LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this one. I was unfamiliar with the Golden Shovel form before picking this one up, but, WOW what an incredible idea. I imagine it is very challenging yet extremely satisfying to write. I loved the poems Grimes shared. I was familiar with some of these poets, but, not all of them. I think I'll have to seek out more Georgia Douglas Johnson. I also loved Grimes' new poems. What this collection does really well is show how timeless poetry is, and how relevant it remains in our lives. If you read only one poetry book this year, I'd recommend it be this one.

That's the problem. This collection alternates between classics of American poetry and fresh efforts by Grimes. I found myself wishing that the Grimes portions would end so that I could get back to the Harlem classics.Grimes wrote this using a \"golden shovel\" technique, which means that she took one or more lines from a classic poem and wrote a new poem with each word from the old poem ending a line. For example, if I used a golden shovel on the first line of \"Hope is the thing with feathers,\" then I would come up with a 6 line poem in which the first line ends with \"hope,\" the second with \"is,\" etc. This technique didn't do much for me. Grimes' poetry seemed to work in spite of it, rather than being enhanced by it. Grimes' golden shovel poems are not usually related to the poem they're golden shoveling from, so there's not a strong connection, thematically, between the paired poems. Furthermore, sometimes Grimes use of English clashes with the wording in the line she's golden shoveled, which feels awkward. Lastly, sometimes she golden shovels an entire poem instead of just one line, which means that her poem is often several pages longer than the one she's shoveled from. It felt unbalanced, especially when the classic poems were the ones I wanted more of.The illustrations are by a variety of leaders in the field. They ranged from good to outstanding. I think the high point of the whole book might have been the pairing of Grimes' evocative poem about \"Ariana\" and E.B. Lewis' accompanying painting on p. 75. I wish the painting had been signed, though. I had to dig around a bit to find out who had made it!"}, {"userName": "Glenda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2456469-glenda", "userReview": "In \u201cOne Last Word\u201d poet Nikki Grimes juxtaposes poetry from the Harlem Renaissance with her original poems inspired by the HR poems using a technique called \u201cThe Golden Shovel.\u201d Grimes explains the technique and its challenges in the collection\u2019s introduction.
