These sisters have a bond that will touch your heart and they live a life that may just break your heart, but a heart cannot be broken without first having been filled to the point of bursting with joy and love. This book is chocked full of wisdom and love that is expressed through each character in its own special way. I don't think you will step away from this book untouched or without falling in love with the characters you meet. I was grinning ear to ear with happy tears in my eyes at witnessing the love Patty Jane and Harriet experienced. There were also times when I was crying to the point of having to put the book down in regards to some of the grief Patty Jane and Harriet had to experience.I think it's safe to say you will love this book!"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3557606-emily", "userReview": "My mom recommended this book for me and I'm not quite sure why. The whole thing felt like it was trying too hard - every life event had to be chocked full with wisdom and little sayings. Each character had these \"charming\" eccentricities that are supposed to be endearing, but instead it felt like too much going on. Finally, even though the characters had many road-bumps along the way and plenty of sadness, none of it really felt genuine. Even the depressing moments felt chocked with sugary-sweetness.I would recommend this for someone who wants a light read and doesn't need much depth. My mom liked it and I do usually trust her taste, so maybe I'm missing something that is there."}, {"userName": "Relyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1060439-relyn", "userReview": "I heard of this book often when it first came out. I even tried to read it at the time. I guess I just wasn't old enough to appreciate it yet. The humor is more subtle than I was ready for maybe? Or the storyline just too hmmmm... not twentysomethingish? I don't know exactly why I didn't like it then, but I know that I do now. I laughed, often. And I cried, too. Often when someone says that they cried at a book, they mean that they teared up. I usually mean that, too. But this time, I cried cried. The blow your nose and have red eyes kind of cry. It was such a happy cry, too. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that it was when my favorite song was featured in a wedding. I guess you could say this book was a lot like real life. Peopled with characters that are both good and bad, quirky and normal. Lives that are happy and sad, but, most of all, full of love.  - - - a note about the narrator - - - Christina Moore read this book and she was wonderful.

Though I read it long ago, I fell in love with Lorna Landvik's style of writing...not to mention a really great story. Lorna writes in a voice that sounds like your best friends'...as though she's just across the table from you sharing a cup of coffee. It's a book I keep on my shelf and have re-read, something I seldom do. You will love the characters, the story-line and the easy drift of words as you turn each page. This is her best book ever.

It was well written, the characters were sarcastic, it was a good book to read when you weren't looking for a lot of substance...shorter chapters that captured your attention, but not requiring a lot of thought. I kept waiting for Avel to die from the get go...didn't expect on the wedding day...corny. And it was said that one of the sisters (trying not to spoil it) died of cancer in the end. We read this book for my BC2 as a tribute to Nancy, that just passed away from cancer. I didn't really need that in the book.

And, I liked the Scandinavian flavor of everything from humor to baked goods to word choices and character traits (like leaving the room to avoid confrontation). Also, tackling a serious theme like alcoholism and showing a positive light on the AA process was a plus as was the interaction with Nora and her dad at the end. So, two stars for all of that. But, I was so sad that the one great character, Avel, had to leave the story after only a few chapters. His interaction with the women was the best part of the book. It went downhill after he died. Maybe his character should have been the manicurist. Also, I think I would have enjoyed the book more if there had been more bantering in the salon among the women (like in Steel Magnolias) than all the overly predictable series of crazy plot events. I agree with another review that said she felt like the book tried too hard; it definitely felt like that when Thor's story was revealed at the end (\"Misery\" came to mind). So, take this one to the beach, but don't expect too much.I have to note the best quote:  \"It's how we Norwegians are. It's hard for us to...to say certain things. We got so we even joked about it. Olaf used to have what he called the 'Vowel Theory.' To get our blood moving, he said, Scandinavians should breed with Iranians and Italians, Africans and Arabs; any person whose country began with a vowel.\""}, {"userName": "Amanda ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17692462-amanda", "userReview": "3.75 starsLorna Landvik is a Minnesota author, and she gets Minnesota right. Minneapolis and St. Paul, their landmarks, river and lakes, come alive reading this. The story is pure fiction to be enjoyed as such.

My Grandma had many variations on \"uff-da.\" When the coffee was done percolating she'd jump up and run to the kitchen chirping \"uff-da meg.\" \"meg\" means \"me\" and her \"uff-da's\" were similar to \"oh no!\" or \"gracious me!\" The Germans would use \"achto lieber\" in the same way. Landvik captures the 1950's focusing more on the Norwegian and Swedish immigrants who settled in south Minneapolis than the Germans. My mother and mother-in-law grew up in the same area Patty Jane does in this tale. They, too, dealt with hardship and tragedy although Patty Jane has so much turmoil in her life it pushes the borders of credibility. The characters are so off-beat they kept my interest as opposed to an interesting plot that was predictable in many spots. Except for Thor. Anyone who says they predicted that plot twist is lying. Patty Jane is a potty-mouthed, strong woman who works hard to raise her daughter after her husband abandons her days before the girl's birth. Her sister, Harriet, is a chain-smoking good friend and the two go through hardships together along with Thor's mother Ione. Patty Jane and Harriet take up most of the narration along with some interesting minor characters. The salon as being a place of female empowerment doesn't quite come to life. The characters needed a bit more fleshing out for me. I couldn't quite visualize it although the gist of a group of supportive women and a man does come through. I did feel that my emotions were being manipulated too much. The women pull their life together and then something awful happens. They come together again before another tragedy. And on it goes so that my sympathetic \"uff-da's\" changed to a disbelieving, \"uff-da!\" My brows were raised more than once. But heck, the characters are fun; the setting is my hometown, and the accents I get, resulting in a quick, enjoyable summer read."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643725-laura", "userReview": "Another great book! The book revolves around Patty Jane and her sister Harriet, as they go through quite a few ups and downs. In Part I, they both are young, a bit naive, and in love but then tragedy strikes. But they support each other, keep trudging on, and then in Part II, they find their second loves...along with quite a few friends with Patty Jane's House of Curl.This book was definitely not some sappy romance novel, and while sad at times, overall was upbeat. And actually, it was pretty funny. My favorite character was Avel, a super-short rich man who the tall and lanky Harriet proceeds to meet and instantly fall in love with one afternoon. My #2 favorite would be Ione, Patty Jane's Norwegian mother-in-law, who bakes amazing desserts and often mis-speaks common English expressions. Overall, there were a lot of great quotes in this book that I wish I would have been writing down. (That's the downside of library books - can't really mark or turn down the pages.)One of the reviews on the back cover compared this book to Fried Green Tomatoes, and actually, though the setting is completely different, this book is pretty similar.

I think it's funny (and kind of insulting) that the first sentence of the blurb on the cover flap says \"An easy-to-read story\". I'll be generous and assume they mean it's easy to read because the story draws you and you care for the characters, not that your brain can easily handle the story structure and vocabulary.
