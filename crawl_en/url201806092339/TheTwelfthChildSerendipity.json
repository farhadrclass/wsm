It is one of the things that I love most about Goodreads is the ability to find new writers who I never outside this \"little world\" would have heard of. Bette has the ability to write in a capability that puts the reader right within the story and one can visualize themselves observing the hurts and joys of the protaganist and his/her surrounding cast of characters. I also love the fact that each book I have read of Bette's portrays strong female characters without having ones who beat you across the head with an \"I am woman hear me roar\" mentality. Set in the 1920's (and a chunk of the story the recent past)The Twelfth Child is no different. I fell in love with the character Abigail Anne, a young woman who struggles against her father's ideas that women have their place and any form education, unless it has to do with cooking/cleaning, have no place for women. She is also struggling with the notion, real or imagined, that her father doesn't value nor love her. How does this affect Abigail as she grows and as an older woman?? Does she allow herself to fall prey to the embezzlement of her caretaker Destiny??"}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "Abigail Anne Lannigan and her twin brother Will were exceptionally close \u2013 but their father only had eyes for his son. William Lannigan only wanted a boy child \u2013 girl children were useless, only good for housework and women\u2019s chores; he expected Abigail Anne would be married off to a well-to-do farmer by the time she turned sixteen. And so it was Abigail Anne\u2019s lot in her young life; her mother, Livonia was a strong woman and told Abigail Anne she could do anything she wanted in her life; strong words back in the early 1900s in the Shenandoah Valley. But Livonia passed away when Abigail Anne was barely thirteen years old \u2013 her cruel and vindictive father then did all he could to ensure she would no longer continue at the schooling she loved, and that Henry, son of a neighbour, would marry Abigail Anne when she turned sixteen.As Abigail Anne moved through her life, she experienced heartache and wonder, love and desperation. But as she entered her eighties, she was fortunate to have a young woman move into the house across the street. The house had been empty for some time, and Destiny Fairchild worked hard, scrubbing, cleaning and generally making the house look sparkling once again. The day that Destiny and Abigail Anne started chatting together, was the day they both found a delightful friendship, a closeness with another person that Abigail Anne hadn\u2019t thought she would ever see again. But their lives were due to change once again and not for the better. What could a total stranger do to the Lannigan family? And why would it happen?I really enjoyed this delightful, emotional novel by Bette Lee Crosby. I had a few laugh out loud moments; times when I wanted to slap a certain person - I loved Abigail Anne \u2013 her character was wonderful. The dreadful times of the Great Depression were heart wrenching, the delight of love and friendship made me smile. I have read a few by Bette and very much enjoy her writing; I have no hesitation in recommending this novel, which is book #1 in the Serendipity Series, highly."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "In the Shenandoah Valley in 1912 twins, Will, and Abigail Anne are born to William and Livonia Lannigan. Sadly, William Lannigan thought only one of the children was valuable - his son. His daughter, despite trying to show she could do everything Will did and at times better, was relegated to the kitchen and what her father considered \u2018women\u2019s work.\u201d After her mother died when the twins were thirteen, Abigail had to fight to stay in school. But hadn\u2019t her mother and her teacher Miss Troy telling her she could do and be anything? However her father was determined Abigail would be nothing more than a farmer\u2019s wife and married by 16. But Abigail had other ideas and put them into practice by leaving the valley. The story takes us from her childhood days to a time when Abigail is in her eighties. At that stage in her life, she comes to know real love and support from a young neighbour Destiny Fairchild. Destiny is just a lovely character and Abigail is a strong and determined woman so the reader is immediately drawn to these two characters. As we all know life is made up of both good, kind people and those who are out for all they can get. Elliot Emerson, is one of those with his grasping ways and claims of being a relative and therefore the heir to the Lannigan estate. Will he succeed?As often happens with books by this author I fell in love with this book from the first page. Once I started it I did not want to put it down. Even though the chapters jump in time, each is clearly labelled and the story flows smoothly. It is an easy and thought provoking read. The story gives a clear picture of attitudes towards women and their lack of rights, especially in some areas, at the time. There is romance in this book but it is more a book about choices, friendship, family, selfishness and selflessness. I loved the ending of this book. It felt absolutely right.

I stayed up until midnight to finish the book. From the first words..\"I was barely thirteen\" to the ending I was caught up in the world created by Bette Lee Crosby.I found her main character to be a very interesting lady.

I have to thank my friends at Goodreads who recommended a book that I would have missed if not for them. I love that Abigail Anne is such a strong female character even in the face of overwhelming circumstances. Her father believes that girl babies/children are worthless, and when the Great Depression hits, Abigail Anne is affected. She has to make do and stand strong.There are characters we love to hate; we just want to reach through the book and rattle their bones, and there are characters we fall in love with. Destiny is one of the characters we love. She is so adorable and kind that we are pulling for her from the beginning of the book.There is an unexpected ending.Crosby deals with timely issues such as caring for the elderly, greed, forgiveness, isolation, love, selfishness, and selflessness.If you like novels about strong women and relationships, you would probably enjoy this book.

I just found a new favorite author!! THE TWELTH CHILD by Bette Lee Crosby covers all the things that makes for a spectacular read----wonderful, heartwarming story; characters who warm your heart, get you laughing, and whom you love to despise; and writing that makes you want to go back and re-read paragraphs. This story of an 'unwanted girl child' from the Appalachians is basically a search for love, friendship, and finding your place in the world. Abigail has come to the end of her years, when she meets the bubbling young Destiny, who moves in across the street from her. They soon become fast friends as they find what they need in each other. This story goes back and forth in time, developing intrigue as a greedy distant relative comes into the picture causing all the trouble that one could possible imagine!

I really enjoyed the story and thoroughly enjoyed the style of writing of the story. The story flowed quite smoothly, but jumped throughout times in ones life as to not stick to the redundancy of a normal day-to-day story. I enjoyed skipping around in time hearing about the different part's of Abigail. I wouldn't call it suspenseful, however, the story moved along enough to leave you wondering exactly what was going to happen in the end. My interest is definitely peaked to see if another novel will follow and I will be watching for it!I felt like there where great, solid character's, not too many and not too few, just right, and we were able to glimpse just enough into each character to get a good feel for each and every one. Bette Crosby kept with making sure there was an Antagonist as well as the Protagonist. I really liked Abigail and really disliked Elliott, the antagonist. I thought that this was a very touching story that was very easy reading that flowed quite smoothly. I found myself reading long into the nights without realizing how long I had been reading because I was just so enthralled with what I was reading. All in all, I am truly ecstatic that I read this book, and can't wait to continue to read \"Spare Change\" and \"Cupid's Christmas\" as I thoroughly enjoyed Bette Crosby's style of writing!

Will ignored his daughter to the point of abuse, but he adored and lavished attention on her brother. Even though Abigail loved her twin brother Will and they got along marvelously, her father ruined her life emotionally and Will's in a certain way.The book's content and storyline is intriguing and one that follows Abigail through her childhood which was made up of hard work and no appreciation and also follows her through decisions she made on her own with her biggest decision being getting away from her father. The book moves back and forth from her childhood to when she is an older woman. Good and bad decisions made her regret a few of her choices, but she made it through just as her mother always told her she would. You will fall in love with Abigail and feel her pain and her fears, and you will wish you could be there with her when she is alone. These lines from Page 122 of the e-book sum up Abigail's character perfectly and give a thoughtful piece of advice to all of us:\"All my life, I'd pinched and saved, always worrying about the future, then before I knew it, I was an old woman with not much future left to worry about and pitifully little to show for all the scrimping. If I had it to do over again, I'd live my life the way Destiny does. She's one person who won't end up with a bunch of regrets about things she didn't do.\" That quote is just a sampling of the wonderful lessons and wonderful story inside THE TWELFTH CHILD. The entire book was filled with everyday happenings and also gave the reader a look at how the human race can be cruel as well as kind. All of these \"lessons\" were told in a lovely, fast-moving fashion that made you laugh, made you cry, and made you do some introspection.I can't praise this book and the author enough...Ms. Crosby is amazing. Her writing is smooth, detailed, interesting, and it pulls you right into the story with believable characters and a wonderful flowing storyline. I couldn't put this book down and was sad when it ended. And.......the ending has a splendid lesson in itself.

Two eras alternating: one from the time when the twelfth child was born to the time when she retired as the town librarian, as told by the voice of a third person; the other talks about the present day, a decade or so after her retirement up until after she died, and her soul has lingered on earth, as told in the twelfth child, Abigail's own voice. It was an easy switch reading about the past, then the present. Abigail's thoughts and words were fitting and they changed as she advanced in years, yet her strong-willed character remained constant.There is some irony for me on the lessons that this story imparts. It is really practical and convenient for someone of Abigail's age to put all her affairs in order well ahead of time. Yet, who can fault her for living in the now, and enjoying the company of the person she had come to love? One can never tell; but doing one's best and having faith that all will turn out right is a sure-fire combination.This is just the first book on the serendipity series... Whether the next one will talk about the lost bonds (which I am still hoping will get to the right person) or not, I can't wait for it to be released."}, {"userName": "McGuffy Morris", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2367393-mcguffy-morris", "userReview": "The Twelfth ChildBy Bette Lee CrosbyBette Lee Crosby is a storyteller extraordinaire.

Abigail\u2019s only comfort is the memory of her mother\u2019s dreams for a better life for Abigail.Leaving the family home, Abigail struggles through \u201cThe Great Depression\u201d, but survives it.

She was the twelfth born child in a family where girls were expected to do \"girl things\" and get married by the time they were sixteen. But Abigail's dreams far surpassed what her father expected from her.After her mother, died she would remember her saying, \"Someday Abigail Anne, someday, every girl with an adventurous heart will be able to follow her dreams\".Seventy years laterDestiny entered her life. She was a giving, happy, optimistic, hard working girl, who had raised herself. Abigail thought it was wonderful to have a neighbor like Destiny and everything was better when she was around. She was always there, whenever Abigail needed a helping hand, and neither expected nor asked for anything in return.Abigail's nephew, Elliot, had only one thing on his mind, her money, and he would do whatever it took to get it. Abigail would never forget what he said, when she first met him. \"So, `this' is Abigail Anne....the twelfth child of William Lannigan....my grandmother was the `first'.\"When a million dollars comes up missing, Elliot is quick to blame it on Destiny. With no one to help, what would become of her?~~~~~~~~~~~~The book cover conveys the feeling of the 1900\u2032s. I love the old time look of it. I find her covers are full of emotion and portray the stories that will be told between the pages.I should know by now, whenever I read one of Bette Lee Crosby's books, I need to have a box of tissues handy. The range of emotions her writing evokes in me go to every extreme. I feel tears in my eyes as I am writing this. The anger and disgust over the disrespect for girls and women is far outweighed by the sadness I feel. To think it is not going on today, is to deny reality. There are still plenty of male chauvinists around, in every walk of life.Bette Lee Crosby's characters are richly developed and read as if they are the people next door. Destiny was such a good person, it was so wrong that she was subjected to all the things she went through.But, no one every said life was fair. I felt her pain and wondered how The Twelfth Child could end up with a happy ending.The things people do for money knows no bounds. Greed is alive and well. I can only hope the cliches are true \"what goes around comes around.\"I always find myself engrossed in her books from beginning to end, unable to put them down. I read The Twelfth Child until the wee hours of the morning. The writing is excellent and swept me along. I had to know what Destiny's destiny would be.5 STARS - Would Buy It For Them (lol)It doesn't really matter to me whether Bette Lee Crosby expects a review from me or not. Her books speak so loudly to me, that I feel I will always have to share them.

It is the story of Abigail Anne Lannigan, a woman who has led a hard life, but who had the determination and strength to survive. It is also the story of Destiny Fairchild, a young woman in her early twenties, who also has a difficult life and befriends Abigail Anne in her senior years. Though separated by their age difference, Abigail Anne sees a lot of herself in Destiny and in their shared commonalities: a rugged spirit, determination and strength in the face of adversity, and generosity; that she takes the young woman under her wing. When Abigail dies, she leaves her estate to Destiny, but a greedy distant relative tries to lay claim to Abigail's estate, and a lawsuit ensues with the departed Abigail watching over the proceedings from heaven. Will justice prevail in Destiny's favor, or will it prevail on the side of greed?The Twelfth Child follows the life of Abigail Anne Lannigan from her birth in 1912 in Chestnut Ridge, Virginia, the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, through the years of her life until her death. Told in the first person narrative that alternates between Abigail's childhood to her senior years, Abigail recounts the story of her life that will leave the reader spellbound. Abigail's voice leaps off the pages as she describes the choices, decisions, successes and regrets that shaped her life. Filled with life lessons, this woman's story is one of inspiration, courage and determination that will engage the reader in some introspection of their own lives.Set in the Great Depression era, the reader is transported to a nostalgic and simpler time period that is rich in detail and vivid descriptions. With characters who are realistic and down-to-earth, they draw the reader into their lives and compel you to care about them and the trials and tribulations that they endure in their lives. Abigail Anne and Destiny are two strong caring women who are unforgettable.The Twelfth Child is a touching story about the beauty and power of a strong bond of friendship that transcends age and time.

She used to work at a bookstore, then as a waitress at night to make more money.Her mother had just taken off when she was younger and others saw to taking her in for a few months at a time til she was old enough to work herself.Problem starts when Elliott introduces himself to the Lannigans after they've sold the family farm and he claims he's related and wants a share of the profits.We learn how Abigail was able to leave-she had promised her father to marry Henry from a neighboring farm once she was done with school...Liked the detailed descriptions of things in the 20's and 30's but it was a bit hard to understand the years missing...Very sad story of events when Abigail had arrived in Richmond..The last half of the book covers the story of Destiny and her troubles with the law.

Now, I don't mean to sound negative, so read on before you think I am bashing the book because nothing could be farther from the truth. This is a fabulous book full of romance, hardship, mystery, and even some history. It is well-written and full of the tragedy and resilience of the human spirit. And it celebrates the strength of women in spite of a sexist society.So why did I mark the book down? Thankfully, it was not for sex scenes because there were not any. The profanity did not become an issue for me until halfway through the book, and I will admit that I found it unnecessary. Even so, that did not affect my perception of the book. My issue was mine and mine alone. When something shifted with the narrator of the story--the main character--I struggled to find the account believable. I don't want to give away the author's technique here, and many people will enjoy the technique. This goes back to personal preference. And once I got past that portion, I was able to set that aside and enjoy the remainder of the book.This book is full of stories that will tug at your heart, and I think the ending may be a bit of a surprise to you.

The \"he\" in this sentence is the the main character's, Abigail's, father. Knowing this is the beginning that Abigail has, I knew she was going to have an uphill battle. I could not wait to continue on to see where the author was going to take me. Her charming characters and enchanting story sucked me in completely as I read further. The author does a wonderful job in developing the plot in layers just like an onion. She flips from the past to the present showing her expertise in storytelling.

The story is great - I love the writing style of past and present and finding out what happens as the storyline develops. She will offer teasers from the future Abigail and when the past Abigail goes into what really happened, it changes everything about the way you thought it was going to develop. The characters are so real and the way Crosby describes something is absolutely hilarious and you can really get a visual of what is going on. Full of Southern quips & Abigail's old lady humor is priceless. :) I think the book could have been a tad bit longer as a few things were left unsaid... although it, by no means, takes away from the story nor does the story require it. However, it would have been nice to learn how Abigail and her twin brother reuninited, how life on the farm was like for Will, was her father ever proud of the decisions she made, what ever happened to her old teacher - did they keep in touch?, etc. It was a macro approach to the story when a few more details would have been appreaciated to give it a more well-rounded personal feel.4.5 stars!!

Or perhaps it is Abigail Anne Lannigan who is the storyteller. Whichever one it is, we are drawn into the book and the stories covering decades and different ways of life.Whenever you think Abigail is going to get a break, life hits her full force.How does her heart remain intact? (We know it is damaged.)From the beginning you know there will be tough times. Born into an era and household where female children are not valued (to the point of not being mentioned by name!) you wonder whether Abigail Anne is even lucky to be born a twin, so the focus is not solely on her. Of course you have to feel bad for her brother as well, but that could be another story. I know Bette Lee would do justice to Will's point of view.From her humble beginnings, Abigail Anne does escape to a different kind of life. Of course that is not the happily ever after she dreams of.I was surprised, and each change renewed my interest in the story.Each time something good seems to come into her life, another complication arises. I think I can relate to that too.The ending of the story left me both happy and sad, but definitely wanting to read the next book."}, {"userName": "Agnes (BeaderBubbe)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3265140-agnes-beaderbubbe", "userReview": "What did I think? I think while at the time I was reading two books....I just had to finish this one first. Bette Lee Crosby did it again. I would have given it 5 stars but I did not like the ending. In a way I understand why Ms Crosby did it....now I truly want to find out what happened - ???? cant say any more because I dont want to give the ending away....but will say the story kept me wanting to hit a few people, kiss a few people and loving Abigail. Never has there been a sweeter book to read. The relationship between her and Destiny was bittersweet.....we should all have a friend like Destiny when we get old...the story brought tears and laughter ..Even though Abigail's life was hard I finished the book feeling that Abigail did not regret anything about her life.I was sent this book by the author because it was on my to-read list in Goodreads - she also signed it, so I will not be lending it out...but it was truly a book I could not put down. I especially loved the part where Abigail, after her death, is looking down on Destiny and all the people involved in the story and the court case that went on after her death. The jury's verdict also was a twist I did not expect.....Love the book! Definitely a must-read."}, {"userName": "Melodie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie", "userReview": "Abigail Lannigan is no stranger to heartache.

What good was she except to keep the house and get the meals on the table? But Abigail is made of much sterner stuff. Again and again, she tries to break through to his heart.And time after time she is rebuffed. Finally after losing her beloved mother and her father tries to force her into an arranged marriage, Abigail makes a run for it. Off to the big city in search of a better richer life,she finds that happiness can be a fleeting thing.The years not always kind, hard learned lessons abound.In her last years, a young neighbor makes her way into Abigail's heart and life. The unlikely friendship is what Abigail has been searching for all her life.  Abigail tells her own story after her death. Her no nonsense approach and pithy humor makes for the telling of quite a tale. Heart breaking,funny and tender are the best words I can describe her life. Bette Lee Crosby is one of those unique people that can put the reader smack dab into the the very heart of the characters.And that makes for a lovely and exciting reading experience."}, {"userName": "Gayle Swift", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7010468-gayle-swift", "userReview": "Bette Lee Crosby has hit another one out of the park!When I received this book, I intended to complete my current read-in-progress before starting \"The Twelfth Child.\" Then I read the excerpt from the back cover--one sentence--and I w hooked. I had to read it immediately.Bette draws her characters with an emotional depth that compels the reader to care about their challenges, to root for their success and to appreciate their bravery. Abigail Anne and Destiny are women you will not forget. Though separated by several generations, their commonalities: a rugged spirit, determination in the face of adversity and generosity in the midst of scarcity, all join to draw them into a deep, satisfying friendship.An envious relative, motivated by greed rather than concern for Abigail, makes allegations that lead to Destiny's arrest.Will the truth emerge? Read \"The Telfth Child\" to find the answer."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10865025-sharon", "userReview": "What a delight, I picked up The Twelfth Child yesterday afternoon intending to read a couple of pages, but not really expecting much, instead I found myself turning page after page wondering what was going to happen next with Abigail Anne and Destiny! The story begins with Abigail Anne fretting about Destiny being possibly sent to jail and as she explains in a roundabout way it is all because of her father's attitude. It IS a roundabout story, a bit of a yarn, but so entertaining. We discover how events of Abigail Anne's life eventually lead to her young friend Destiny being accused of theft and forgery mainly through Destiny's naivity and Abigail Anne's procrastination. The travel through Abigail Anne's life is enjoyable, though at times a bit predictable. Betty Lee Crosby has a sly sense of humour and I found myself smiling quite frequently in the story which balanced the moments when I wished I could reach through the page and shake Abigail Anne!"}, {"userName": "Marci", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12223865-marci", "userReview": "This book required a little work to get started - I was a bit confused at the beginning, but stick with it - you will have to go a long way to find a more likable character than Abigail Anne Lannigan. Ms. Crosby has once again transported us to a time that we think of with nostalgia and try to tell ourselves was a simpler time. In reality, there were villains then, there were good people then, there were injustices, heartache, joy, love, and all the things that make life such a treasure - and Bette Lee Crosby gives them all to us in The Twelfth Child. This is a book that has you wanting to jump right in there and live with these folks. The characters are so real and vivid that you want to add them to your address book. The writing is crisp and clean, the characters are real - read this book - you will be glad that you did."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6958934-teresa", "userReview": "The enchanting story of two lonely ladies, one older and one younger, who build a relationship borne out of their unique circumstances and the need they each have for a special someone in their lives. They both give to the other freely and unselfishly. Unfortunately both are a bit naive as to the ways of the world and before the story concludes one will die and the other will find herself under attack from a greedy relative and the legal system.Ms. Crosby has a very special gift of creating characters that one can't help but fall in loves with. They are folks who would make great neighbors or relatives. Their stories would be welcomed at family reunions or over cups of hot chocolate in front of a fireplace."}, {"userName": "Faye Heath", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947260-faye-heath", "userReview": "I picked up this book after reading a review from a fellow Goodreads member whose judgement I trust.
