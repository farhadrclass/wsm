I loved this book. It follows five women, strangers really, except for two who were pen-pals. They all end up flatmates in Chicago in the early fifties. The story follows their lives and friendships and I found myself completely immersed in their stories. Each one is different in personality and every woman will see herself in one of theses characters. They are characters you care about and want to know more about them. I'd love to see how their lives went after the close of this book. And that's that typifies Eva Marie Everson's writing, I always want more. Novel Rocket and I giver it our highest recommendation.

Five stories, five romances, five wonderful weddings.Chicago, early 1950s. Joan Hunt, recently returned to the country of her childhood from England, embarks on a journey she could not have invented\u2014no job, staying at the Y, but determined to make her way and be independent. When she secures a job at Hertz, she also meets Betty Estes, soon to become one of her best friends. Betty invites Joan to room with her and her two other roomies. Joan agrees after finding there will also be room for her longtime pen pal, Evelyn, who will be joining her soon. So begins the story of Joan and Betty and Evelyn and the sisters from Minnesota, Magda and Inga.On a day when they all unexpectedly find themselves at home, the young women decide to make a day of it. Off they go to see Singing in the Rain starring Gene Kelly. After the movie, as they\u2019re walking down the street, they see the most gorgeous wedding dress in the window of Carson Pirie Scott. On a whim, led by the irrepressible Betty, they go into the store, all try on the dress, then impulsively decide to buy it together.As the years passed by, they got married one by one and then passed the dress on to the next bride. Though they were not all close friends, the dress continued to connect them after their early days in Chicago in the little basement apartment were long past.You\u2019ll love these five women, you\u2019ll agonize with them over their jobs and their romances, and you\u2019ll beam with them as they each wear that very special wedding gown. This is a story you\u2019ll not soon forget. Five stars plus!Eva Marie Everson told me at our recent interview that a friend brought her the story with a \u201cYou have to hear this!\u201d Eva agreed the story was very special and determined to write it. However, three years passed before she was able to get an interview with the last surviving bride, eighty-three-year-old Joan Hunt Zimmerman. Eva wrote the story, turned it in to her publisher who loved it, but came back to her saying Joan\u2019s story was great. However, they wanted a book with all five stories in it and they hoped to have it within two months. Out went the eighty-five thousand word book (which I was a beta reader for and which was wonderful) and in two months, in went the over one hundred twenty thousand word new manuscript.I asked Eva what she had learned about herself while working on the book(s). She said she was often reminded that no matter how crooked the path we walk upon, God straightens it and points us down His path. She learned that she could rise to the challenge of creating and writing within a very short time frame when she loved and believed in the subject.Eva\u2019s first published book, One True Love, published in 2000, was a compilation of stories about the engagements of people she interviewed. Once she interviewed them, she wrote their stories. This book was so successful that it was quickly followed by One True Vow about their weddings. Shadow of Dreams, a novel, followed next\u2014the first in a series of three books\u2014also published in 2000-2001.Eva Marie Everson is a Carol Award Winner, has finaled for the Christy Awards, has two Maggie Awards, and two AWSA Golden Scroll Awards for Fiction. The Pot Luck Club books she wrote with Linda Evans Shepherd have sold over two hundred thousand copies. Her book adaptation of the movie, Unconditional, was a Christian Booksellers Association best seller.Eva says she writes because she believes in the importance of fiction in faith. After all, Jesus taught in stories. She uses her fiction to tell of Jesus\u2019 love to people in a gentle fashion.One thing her readers don\u2019t know about her is that while she was on a telephone interview with Christian Retailing Magazine, she was struck by lightning. Lightning struck her house, came through the phone, and literally blew her across the room. She picked herself up, apologized to the interviewer, and continued. When the interviewer, Sean Fowlds, asked what had happened and she explained, his comment was, \u201cShocking!\u201dI guarantee that no matter which Eva Marie Everson book you purchase, and there are many, you will never be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Lindsey (Books for Christian Girls)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19266895-lindsey-books-for-christian-girls", "userReview": "[(turns out his wife died a few years ago) (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tammi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29622799-tammi", "userReview": "What wonderful story based in the 1950s. The prologue and the epilogue are actually set in current time and I just adore the story in between. The story is set in Chicago in the 50s. It stars 5 young women, Joan, Betsy, Evelyn, Inga, and Magna, who are roommates. Though born in Chicago, Joan\u2019s family moved to England when she was a child. Evelyn is a Georgia farmer\u2019s daughter and she and Joan were international childhood pen pals. When Joan decides to move back stateside after the War in attempt to earn money to send back to her struggling family in England, Evelyn decides it is time for her to leave the South and the two meet up in Chicago. They room together, along with the other three ladies and their stories unfold. Ms. Everson does such a pristine job with the development of each of the lady\u2019s characters. The idea seems like a lot to keep up with, but it is not. I appreciated the qualities and even the faults of each character. The author made them very easy to get to know.

The five women portrayed in Five Brides are significantly different from one another, but as women, shared many of the same needs and desires.

I enjoyed it alright, but it wasn't really my kind of book. With five main characters, it felt strained to get to know any of them very well, and I didn't really get into the 1950's period.

Yet, to my surprise (and delight), each of the five characters are, as the summary states, \u201cvery different.\u201d And not only that, but their romances are different and the romantic interests/men in their lives are different as well.Since there are five characters, the book never quite spends as much time as I would like on each one. There are a lot of viewpoint jumps as well as time jumps, and it became clear to me very soon that the book was only concerned with getting the women into the dress\u2014what happens to them afterword was not addressed, except in the case of Betty and, in passing, Inga. As a result, the first half of the book flies by, what with five women all having their own experiences, but the second half of the book is slower-paced as the number of women dwindle. And I found the second half harder to get through, likely because of that slower pace.For the most part, I was fine with the jumps\u2014I\u2019m not usually fond of time jumps, but I thought these were necessary so the book didn\u2019t get any longer than it already was. I was disappointed, though, that Inga was shunted to the side. She has possibly the saddest storyline of the five women, and the way it ends was not satisfying in the slightest since we never get to see her again after her marriage. Instead, we get about two sentences from Magda as to how Inga is doing and never get inside Inga\u2019s head to see if she\u2019s loved and loving. That was disappointing.I also wish we had seen more of Evelyn\u2019s bounce back from her relationship with George. We see it only briefly, and with all of the time jumps it lacks impact. And her wedding isn\u2019t even shown at all, which unfortunately made it seem as if the author just wanted the book to be over since Evelyn is the last to get married and all we get is Joan or Betty saying, \u201cOh, yeah, Evelyn\u2019s getting married,\u201d Epilogue, End. Probably not how she intended it, but it came across that way all the same.Five Brides manages to pull off five different characters with five different personalities and five different romances (with five (and more!) different men as love interests!), which impressed me because I haven\u2019t seen a lot of novels of this ilk pull that off with just one or two characters, let alone five. But because of the many characters, things were rushed for one or two of them, and so Inga\u2019s story ended abruptly and unsatisfactorily, and Evelyn\u2019s wedding and \u201cgetting the dress\u201d moment wasn\u2019t even present in the story at all. In addition, the pace of the book alters significantly, causing the second half of the book to be more a trudge than the first.Disclaimer: This book was provided by Tyndale in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Slattery", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3932581-jennifer-slattery", "userReview": "This novel captivated me and created a deep sense of nostalgia\u2014for a time period I\u2019ve never lived in. I\u2019ve always enjoyed stories that capture a sense of relational connectedness and community, and to me, that\u2019s what made this novel so heart-warming. It takes a gifted writer to craft a novel with five key and distinct characters. Ms. Everson drew me deeply to each character and the time period in which they lived. The story begins in a hotel room in London, England in 2015, with a bride waiting for a special wedding dress\u2014a wedding dress with a rather enchanting history. In the following chapter, the story behind this dress begins to unfold. But the greatest stories are not about the dress but instead, the women who purchased it, the growth they experienced, the challenges they overcame, and the bond they shared. The novel quickly time-shifts to 1951, Chicago. In this historically rich city, five women roommates, living at a time when women were still fighting for the right to work and receive equal pay, pushed against societal expectations to find independence. I loved experiencing old Chicago, and the author did a great job of fully immersing me in setting. As I said previously, all the characters captured my heart, and I\u2019ve been trying to determine which female I enjoyed most. Though they were all memorable, I greatly admired Betty and feel she was the unifying thread of these special female relationships. A strong and confident socialite raised in luxury, she valued her independence so much, she was willing to lose everything in order to be true to herself. She became the voice of reason to the other women in the story and continually, but gently, pointed them toward strength, self-respect, and self-discovery. The other women had similar stories of finding themselves, and, of course, true love. Some had to learn the hard way, and it was painful watching them travel down a road of self-destruction. But in the end, their relationship to one another, symbolized by a beautiful and shared wedding gown, remained intact and carried them through, ultimately bringing out the best in each of them. I really loved this story, much more than this review indicates because I find myself struggling to explain just what it was that captivated me so. But I think it was the special bond these women shared. In our fast-paced, technologically driven culture, relationships can be so fleeting and surface level. It was refreshing and endearing to read about relationships that withstood the test of time and distance. And perhaps that\u2019s why this story created such a sense of nostalgia, carrying with it the reminder that relationships matter. I\u2019d definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves women\u2019s fiction, historical fiction, and romance."}, {"userName": "Holly Barrett", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14988568-holly-barrett", "userReview": "Sometimes the friendships of women get a bad rap. Women are portrayed in pop culture as mean, and other words that I won\u2019t print here. Relationships with other women are easily forfeited for the guy du jour or a better job or whatever. And frankly, sometimes that reputation has been earned.But more often than not, my experience in the world of women has been rich and beautiful. It\u2019s why I loved Eva Marie Everson\u2018s book, Five Brides. Ms. Everson tells the story of five women who share an apartment in Chicago just after World War II. It\u2019s a time when women are learning to step out of the shadow of family and home to fulfill their dreams. Betty is from a wealthy family, and is trying to break away from the life her mother leads. Joan travels to the US from war-torn England and works multiple jobs to care for her family. Evelyn leaves her southern roots to find out where she really wants to be. And the sisters Inga, a flight attendant, and Magda, a secretary, whose reactions to their deeply religious upbringing take each of them down different roads.It\u2019s a busy time for all of the women as they work hard to become independent. Single working women in the 1950\u2019s faced a lot of pressure from families, employers, landlords, and the men that entered their lives. Five Brides follows these women through the ups and downs of several years of living together and centers on a wedding dress they see in a store window one Saturday. When they all try it on and decide to buy it together, their friendships blossom and their lives are forever intertwined.Everson\u2019s characters struggle with the times they are living in, the pressures of family expectations, and the desire to live their own lives. They are not instantaneous friends just because they live together. They struggle through some moments of jealousy and disagreement. Yet, in the end, they are bound by shared experiences and love and concern for one another. These women took hold of their own lives at a time when that wasn\u2019t always accepted. They also took hold of their friendships. They chose to love rather than compete. They chose to support rather than discourage. They chose to share rather than divide. And the love they developed helped them cover the times of frustration or disappointment.**I received this book free from the publisher through the Tyndale Blog Network.

Determined and unwavering, Joan will do whatever she sets her mind to do.Magda and Inga Christenson have decided to venture out on their own, away from their family\u2019s strong religious convictions and restrictions. Magda lives in the shadow of her sister but she longs to write, Inga is stunning and finds a job as a stewardess. Always more outgoing, Inga goes for what she wants while Magda is content not to rock the boat. Both find themselves on the opposite side of their original intentions for better or for worse.Evelyn Alexander wants something more than a simple life in the south. Encouraged by her pen pal, Joan, she ventures to Chicago to find adventure and the something more she\u2019s been looking for. Evelyn also longs for true love and when she thinks she\u2019s found it, she will not be deterred, even against the wishes of those who love her most.Five women so different and yet so much alike, become roommates and friends. They share their dreams, the failures and their wish to wear a beautiful wedding dress someday. Putting the cart before the horse, they take their destinies into their own hands and make a pact to share this incredible dress, whenever the day arises.

The rest of it not so much. I found Joan to be the most interesting of the girls, but found the rest of them to fall into stereotypes and cliches pretty fast. You have Betty, who is rich and wants to live but her family wants her to marry right, as in the boy they've basically picked out for her but she's not interested in. Evelyn, who is chubby and sweet and earnest and willing to change herself entirely for a man and always seems a bit out of place in the city. One of the sisters (Inga and Magna, but I honestly had trouble keeping which was which in terms of names) is a secretary with dreams of being a writer and falls in love with her boss whose wife is dead and his mother doesn't like her. The other sister who is a flight attendant and falls in love with the wrong guy and gets pregnant and then is married off to hide it. I feel like I've head most of those stories one way or another. The workaholic Brit come to America was the only one I felt was something remotely new. Everything else felt rather predictable and a more boring Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants with the shared wedding dress. Maybe if the dress had been purchased when they all had no plans to marry, just a wild whim there would have been more intrigue. But other than Joan who clearly has prioritized working, everyone else seems to so clearly want to get married and constantly have their eye on some guy. In that circumstance, yeah just buy the dress and share it who cares. Also, yeah I get that it's the 1950's and admittedly I didn't know the author wrote \"Christian Lit\" but there was an aspect of the whole plot being wiped clean instead of actually dealing with some of the issues laid out in the plot. Conflict was low and with nothing to really fight for the characterization and plot suffered. Not my cup of tea and not something I would recommend.

Imagine five women in the early 50's being thrown together as roommates. All strangers except for two that grew up as pen pals. One rare day they find themselves spending the day together and during that time they spot a beautiful breathtaking wedding dress in an exclusive shop window. On a whim they decide to go in and each try on the dress. The sales lady is a little put out knowing she'll be spending time with each of them and no sales in sight. After they all try the dress on they decide to each put in a fifth of the cost of the dress even though none have a marriage in the works. Each lady on their wedding day gets to wear the dress, then it is passed on to the next to marry. Thus begins the story of their friendship, challenges and romances.Betty was my favorite character. She was the stabilizing force among the women. She also had the maiden name Estes, which is also my maiden name. Another of the ladies, Joan, wound up in the south eventually, where I live. She spent many growing up years in England so the south was a great culture shock. Evelyn was the last to marry and the dress was then passed down to her daughter-in-law and then her granddaughter. The story of the five brides was told to the granddaughter, who was getting ready to be married and wear the dress. The author, Eva Marie Everson, based this book loosely on a true story involving Joan Hunt. Her character was stretched somewhat and the others were totally fictional. I enjoyed this book and how each character had her own unique story. The way different situations were handled was a true representation of the fifties time period. Being born in the fifties, it is one of my favorite time periods to read about. As you read this book you'll come to love each lady in their own uniqueness, the friendships built along the way and the family dynamics involved. I highly recommend this book.I was given a copy of this book by Bookfun through the publisher for my honest review, which I have given."}, {"userName": "Deana Dick", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6244880-deana-dick", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book from bookfun.org and Tyndale Publishing for an honest reviewThe book is about five very independent women finding themselves as roommates in an apartment. They all come from different backgrounds, but share a common goal. They are each wanting to make it in the big city of Chicago in the 50's. The arrangement is a perfect fit for everyone. Each woman seems to have different schedules and hardly see each other. On one particular day, they found themselves off work at the same time . They decide to go on an adventure and explore downtown. They discover an exquisite wedding dress expertly displayed in the window of a shop. They are drawn to this dress and soon find themselves in the store. As each one tries on the dress, they know they must have it. I chuckled a bit as I read that each woman was willing to put in their amount in order to purchase the dress and share it. That idea I thought was a perfect setup for a story that would take me through the friendship, heartaches , romances and possible weddings of each woman. The author develops the characterswith such grace as she writes about their strengths and weaknesses, which made me enjoy reading about each one. Will they each be able to share that special dress? Can it make their wedding special , knowing that someone else had worn it? I loved the journey the author takes the reader on as we get a closer look as each woman and how the dress would come to be a part of their journey. Do they all wear the dress and get married? I found the book to be very entertaining and was impressed with the details the author used in giving us a taste of what it was like in the 50's. Thank you for letting us follow each woman as they made memories and how one dress and five women made an unforgettable story come to life."}, {"userName": "Karen Dean", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17474811-karen-dean", "userReview": "What do a wealthy, young socialite; an American born Brit; a young Georgian farm girl; and two Swedish Lutheran pastor\u2019s daughters have in common? The answer is \u2013 very little. What they do end up having in common is a designer wedding dress that they bought together with the agreement that each could wear it on her wedding day. The last to wear it would get to keep it. The story starts in 2015 and the granddaughter of one of the girls is about to get married wearing this special dress. In preparation for the wedding, the tale of the five other brides is told. The quintet start out as roommates who are in Chicago, all trying to prove that they are independent women. Betty, the wealthy socialite is the only one from Chicago. As such, she ends up helping all the other girls find jobs, loaning them proper clothes, and giving out warnings about how to negotiate not only the streets of Chicago, but also the men in Chicago. We have five stories of love and marriage. Some end happily ever after and some wait and see. Each girl\u2019s wedding will be made more special by the opportunity to wear the wedding dress.As I got more and more into the book, I found it more difficult to put down. Each girl\u2019s story was very different and true to life. We had hateful former mother-in-laws, babies born out of wedlock, innocence and naivet\u00e9 being taken advantage of, overbearing parents, etc. etc. My major complaint is that I wished to know more about how everything turned out. While some might have trouble with the constant switching of stories, I did not find it difficult to follow. It was delightful to learn in the Author\u2019s Note that this story is partially based on a true incident. I received this from the Book Club Network in exchange for my honest opinion."}], "description": "One dress, five women, a lifetime of memories.Five single, fiercely independent women live together in a Chicago apartment in the early 1950s but rarely see one another.
