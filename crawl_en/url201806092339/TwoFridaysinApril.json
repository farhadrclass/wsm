A year later and it is Daphne\u2019s stepdaughter\u2019s birthday but also the first anniversary of Finn\u2019s death. How is it possible to celebrate Una\u2019s birthday when Una, Daphne and Mo, Finn\u2019s mother are all still grieving? But they attempt to. Except plans do not work out at all as Daphne expects. This is a story of loss and grief, guilt and forgiveness, love and family, told from four points of view. The reader learns more about Daphne, Mo, Una and Daphne\u2019s mother, Isobel. Isobel left her husband Jack and Daphne when she was a young child. As a result the relationship between Isobel and Daphne is very strained. I liked the way we saw different aspects of the relationships and life events from the four different perspectives. There were a couple of things in the course of the story that seemed too co-incidental to me, but I was prepared to overlook them because the story and characters captivated me. And yes, there were a few tears at times. This is a thoroughly enjoyable story with likeable characters that are easy to relate to. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who likes a feel good read. A charming book."}, {"userName": "Steph", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11109307-steph", "userReview": "Once started I devoured this book and couldn't put it down.A really enjoyable drama with lots going on with each character separated and together.Really liked the way you got the story from the 4 main characters own perspectives, Daphne, Isobel, Mo and Una, all suffering in their own way with the loss of Finn a year ago.Some little twists and turns thrown in there and you have a great wee read."}, {"userName": "Obsidian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian", "userReview": "I was surprised to find this book just okay. It's not bad or anything, I just didn't find it very gripping considering the subject matter. I think Meaney has done a better job of showcasing the same characters over a period of days/week before (see \"Last Week of May\"). I think the main issue is that we shuffle between four characters, then we get the stories broken into duos, and then we revisit the same characters more than a year later and though one character goes through something life changing, it feels a bit samey which is weird.\"Two Fridays in April\" has the Darling family dealing with recovering from the one year anniversary of the death of Finn Darling. The book shows the POV of Daphne Darling (Finn's widow), Mo Darling (Finn's mother), Isobel Franklin (Daphne's mother) and Una Darling (Finn's stepdaughter). Daphne still feels adrift after losing her husband and doesn't know what to do with regards to her stepdaughter Una. Daphne's mother in law Mo isn't much help. Daphne's mother Isobel is nearby, but the two of them rarely talk about \"real things.\" I was interested in Isobel more than the other characters though she felt like a secondary character to me even though we get her POV. Daphne I thought was a bit much though at times. She's still harboring resentment towards her mother for abandoning her for a few months when she was 6. You find out later that her mother came back after her affair exploded in her face. But from then on she saw her on scheduled visits. So I guess I just don't get why they had not talked about it before now and or why she would be holding it against her? It just felt odd. Mo is dealing with not only losing her husband, but coming to grips that her husband she loved is dealing with the affects of Alzheimer's disease. Mo is pretty bitter about the fact that Daphne and Finn didn't have children since she doesn't feel as close to Una since she's not Finn's \"real daughter.\" Such a mess. I was not a fan of Mo by the way at all while reading her sections. She tries to bully Daphne into quitting her job to reopen Finn's shop with her and doesn't care that Daphne doesn't want to. Whether she has a bustling career or not, it's still her life. Isobel's POV felt like it could be her own book. She has a lot of regrets that she is dealing with now that she is almost 60. One of them is leaving her first husband for another man due to how that affected her relationship with her daughter Daphne. Isobel realizes too late how foolish it was to run from her first marriage to a man who ended up dumping her soon after to return to his own family. She is now married to 10 years to a man she realizes that she doesn't love and who doesn't love her. Isobel is determined though to get a bit of passion in her life and you get to read about her trying her best to meet men (yep still married) on a dating site. Una feels more lost. Finn is her father (not her real father) her birth mother died when she was small and now she is left with her father's widow who she feels really doesn't want her around. Una goes around making a ton of mistakes throughout the book, but her story-line felt very real to me. I wish that it had been the second POV in the book or maybe the book should have really focused on just her and Daphne's POV. I would not have missed Mo's POV at all and as I already said, Isobel's read as weird to include here.The writing was okay. I think the main issue was the flow was not that great. We go from the different POVs and then we are also jumping around in timelines. So if you start reading about Una, we have her going into what she has been up to almost for a year and going up to the present day in her POV chapter. It made things a bit confusing to read I found. The latter section (Friday, 29, April (A Year and a Bit Later) wraps things up nicely though (a bit too nicely). Meaney tries for a twist with a character and I thought that something else happened, but we get a surprise with her."}, {"userName": "Genevieve NZ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52590744-genevieve-nz", "userReview": "A complicated story with too many people vying to be the main character. Was it Daphne, Una, Mo or the self-centred Isobel? I found it frustrating to have the same scene retold the the eyes of each of the 'main characters'. The subtle tying in of the kites and the banner in the sky (everyone noticing it on subsequent chapters) just a bit much really. Why did Una have to be Daphne's child from a one-night stand? I couldn't fit that part into the story at all, and for me it just complicated it even further. Una's horrific attempted rape by 'Dave' was not pursued as he 'didn't really harm her... - REALLY???? Where was the police complaint ... CCTV footage outside the hotel... reg. plates of his car?? If you are going to write scenes of sexual assault of this nature, please don't dismiss it with 'not actually being harmed'. The actual plot was ok- loved father killed, all the women in his life grieving in their own ways, each having their own secrets. However, I was screaming at the book to 'get on with the story!!' to little avail. Some of the characters were fairly excruciating & it would have been great to read about women who are able to stand on their own two feet without the need of a man around to make them feel complete. I won't be reading anymore of Meaney's books, unless her predictable writing style matures."}, {"userName": "Kobby Gyampoh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1115549-kobby-gyampoh", "userReview": "Also available on http://chicklitpad.blogspot.co.uk MY SYNOPSISImagine This: Your husband died on his daughters\u2019 birthday. He was getting back from his way to pick up a present for her. And well, he died.Now a exactly a year later, you all are not looking forward to celebrating a birthday. Because that would mean celebrating his one-year anniversary. You are not meant to celebrate his anniversary. You are still mourning. He wasn\u2019t meant to die, how can fate be so cruel?Apparently, you are not the only one not looking to celebrate a birthday. The daughter cannot, will not get over the fact that, her father died on his way to pick-up a present for her. He was supposed to return on her seventeenth. He wasn\u2019t supposed to die and leave her lost and alone in this world, how the hell does anyone get over survivor\u2019s guilt?But guess who seems pretty upbeat and is ready to throw up a dinner, get a cake and sing happy birthday? Your unbearable mother-in-law. Well, at least, there\u2019s someone looking up to eating your cake. But all this doesn\u2019t feel right. Why doesn\u2019t that woman own a sympathetic bone in her? Why can she not understand if she\u2019s fecking fantastic and so over her son\u2019s death, you lot are not over his death too? Why does she have to suggest a minor-gathering on a day you\u2019d rather spend staring aimlessly at a headstone and bawling your eyes out?Unfortunately, you have no idea today, would lead to a chain of events that would teach you to move on, celebrate, and get a fucking life even if your fate has said good riddance to your husband.Daphne Darling\u2019s life summed up for your delight.MY REVIEWI loved, loved this book! So, it\u2019s so obvious I\u2019d be yelling at you to go buy it!First of all, terrific storyline. I love the whole dark themes this book explores in a very engaging way. A book about loss and dying and mourning could be boring. But not this title. In a day, Woman has rather been flitting through routines without performing them with zest since her husband\u2019s death. And why the hell did he have to be buried in the same grave as his first wife? Why did he have to leave her with a teenager she\u2019s finding hard to connect with? And a mother-in-law who\u2019s as cold, and heartless as, um, a serial killer? Anyway, amazing storyline!\u2500\u2500 \u2605The main characters are fantastic. It\u2019s told in the point of view of four women who need to pick up the pieces after the death of a son, a husband, a father, and a son-in-law. You\u2019d love Daphne for being so\u2026 dull (but really, who isn\u2019t after losing their husband), you\u2019d find her relatable if you\u2019ve had to lose someone you love! (Like how I lost my dog and my life would never be the same again!) You\u2019d love Mo, the mother-in-law who\u2019s harsh on the outside, but on the interior she\u2019s warm and does everything with a good thought, but really, who loves an old woman over eighty finding it hard to show remorse and complaining every darn time? You\u2019d also love Una, the daughter who\u2019s grieving her dad\u2019s death, and in my opinion, the boldest of all three women. Isobel is the mother of Daphne who left her when she was only six, she\u2019s worried she\u2019s turning sixty and wondering why she spends her life with the most emotionless man on earth. A star to all these main characters.\u2500\u2500 \u2605\u2605Other main characters are just a delight. There\u2019s Finn, the dead husband who\u2019s ever present in past accounts. There\u2019s Theo, the son of the man who took away Una\u2019s father. There\u2019s the whole bunch related to the man who took away Una\u2019s father you\u2019d absolutely adore. You\u2019d also love Dolly, the dog who someone has to hold on to when another is leaving the house because she\u2019d jump on them and begin licking. There\u2019s Alex, \u00a0Isobel\u2019s second husband who probably doesn\u2019t have the right signals that send emotions to the brain, hence is bare. There\u2019s George, Daphne\u2019s stepbrother who\u2019s considerate and sweet with kids. You\u2019d also love Jack, Daphne\u2019s father who backs out of an argument even before it starts whose wife left him for his predictability. A star to all these characters. None redundant, all enjoyable!\u2500\u2500 \u2605\u2605\u2605This is excellent literary piece. It\u2019s hard to find a title that demonstrates literary prowess and experience of the author and still be appealing. This book was all stretched out in a day, yet not boring! You\u2019d love how Roisin connects the dots in each characters\u2019 account explaining your whys and hows to give more depth and understanding to the story. You\u2019d love how Roisin is such a tease, cutting off information, witholding it and supplying it at a later time (in that same chapter, mind you), when she feels it\u2019s most paramount to bring up! Only a writer could admire these attributes of Roisin Meaney. Surprisingly, no backstory is left out, engaging as the present day account.\u2500\u2500 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605So this book is not big on OMG-moments, yet it\u2019s hard to put down. You\u2019d find the story engaging, moving and delightful. A star.\u2500\u2500 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn a few tricks on how to be an amazing storyteller as well as good writer. Anyone who wants something that explores dense themes yet ends on a satisfying note should get this book.\u00a0Anyone who wants a title to steal away their summer hours without noticing (because it all happens in a day!) should go pick this title."}, {"userName": "The Reading Panda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48876594-the-reading-panda", "userReview": "This is one of the best novels I have read in 2017. Roisin Meaney has become one of my favorite Irish authors. Her characterization is impeccable, her writing is beautiful, and her plot is addictive. Every time I had to stop reading, my hands were itching to get back to the novel. You have two main characters, Daphne and Una. There are also two secondary characters, Isobel and Mo. This is where Meaney shines. All of the characters were extremely flawed, but extremely lovable as well. Daphne clocked out on her step daughter, Una, but her grief over the loss of her husband and her love for Una were unquestionable. Even through her grief, she managed to hold her family together. Mo is Daphne's mother in law. In the first chapter she seemed callous and even cruel to Daphne. It is a sign of excellent craftmanship that Mo was ultimately lovable. Mo had to withstand hardship after hardship and was roughened by them. Despite my initial dislike, I saw Mo's fortitude and loyalty, and I loved her for it. Isobel, Daphne's mother, was on the periphery of Daphne's life. It was a pleasure to be able to understand the perspective of a character I would normally dislike (who would desert their family?). Regardless of her flaws, she loved Daphne deeply. Una is Daphne's stepdaughter . So many teenagers are portrayed as dumb, reckless, fickle,and wild. It was refreshing to come across a teenager raised well and with a good head on her shoulders. She was compassionate, loving, forgiving, and caring. I just wanted to protect her. As for the plot, it includes all of the characters' perspectives. Usually, many pov's tend to make the story messy. Meaney,however, made the multiple perspectives enriching and enjoyable. All the perspectives weave together, and, in the end, the reader gets a 360 view of the situation. I LOVED the book and cannot recommend it more."}, {"userName": "Amanda - Go Book Yourself", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4684302-amanda---go-book-yourself", "userReview": "Review also posted on my blog here: http://www.gobookyourself.info/2015/0...Thanks to Hachette Ireland for the review copy Roisin does it again! Another brilliant read full of wonderful characters!Two Fridays In the same month. but what a difference a year can make. It's the second of April and its Una's birthday but no one feels like celebrating. Why? Because its also a year to the day since Una's dad was knocked from his bike and killed.Since then nothings been the same. A rift has been created in the family. Daphne is not Una's biological mother so she now feels like a liability. Daphne adores Una but feels unsure around her. She wants her to feel safe and loved but she doesn't know how to do it. She cant turn to her own mother, who is distant and seemingly uncaring. Mo feels totally alone in the world. Her husband was gone long before he died due to dementia and now then her only son was taken from her. She feels like she has no part left to play.In the end it takes Una to realize that one of them needs to act in order to save what they have left. Throughout the course of the day they discover that all the ever needed was right in front of them. They just needed to open there eyes and see it. The character development in Two Fridays is fantastic. You really fall for the characters and you as a reader go on the same journey as they do. You feel what they feel.

Daphne can't turn to her own mother Isabel for advice as their relationship is distant, to say the least, and Mo, Finn's elderly mother, is still grief-stricken at the death of her only son, so she is of little help.
