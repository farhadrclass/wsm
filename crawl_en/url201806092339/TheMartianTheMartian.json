Watney's journals read like a nerdy blog rather than a dramatic survivor's diary. It's hard to find something harrowing and traumatic when the protagonist is saying \"yay!\" a lot and making incessant corny puns. \"3.6 pirate-ninjas!\" \"Yay oxygen!\" \"Lol gay probe lol!!!!!1!\" \"Bad rover, no Scooby snack!!!111!\" \"LOL craaaaaaap!!1!\" For me, those aren't funny, they're almost embarrassing.No matter what horrible thing is happening to Watney, he's sure to pull though, but not before laying a smug, cutesy zinger on us. It sucks all the tension out of any situation, which is the complete opposite of what I want in a book that's supposed to be a thriller.Now, don't get me wrong, Andy Weir is a great technical writer. When Watney isn't being a wacky douche, he's going on and on about some technical or mechanical or biological process that, with me not being a scientist, usually goes over my head. And that's fine, I have no fault with a book that's factually complicated like that. In fact, it's really admirable and cool that Weir is able to pool all of his expertise into a book about survival on Mars. That being said, other aspects of the book suffer. According to the author's bio on the back of the book, Andy Weir \"was first hired as a programmer for a national laboratory at age fifteen and has been working as a software engineer ever since. He is also a lifelong space nerd and a devoted hobbyist of subjects like relativistic physics, orbital mechanics, and the history of manned spaceflight.\" If I can stereotype here, it shows. My guess is that he doesn't really know how people behave or interact in the real world. The dialog is stilted and awkward. The characters are all one-dimensional and flat. They almost seem like an afterthought. The emotional and psychological trauma rendered by all these near-death experiences and complete and utter isolation? What trauma? There's no mention of that anywhere. Watney is apparently that cool and awesome of a guy, as evidenced by all his canned laugh track one-liners and grating sarcasm.But hey, maybe that doesn't bother some people (obviously, considering that people actually watch The Big Bang Theory), and they're in for a technologically-driven, \"funny\" space-thriller. Because I have to admit, it's a terrifyingly cool premise. It just wasn't what I was expecting. I was hoping for an emotionally-taxing, horrifying, survival drama, but instead got a cutesily witty astrophysics manual. Just because something is nerdy doesn't automatically mean that it's good."}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "'Crap!

A meticulously researched, briskly paced and surprisingly funny story about an astronaut left behind on Mars, presumed dead, who must now figure out how to survive and let the folks back on Earth know he is alive and needs rescue.

A thrilling survival story with a hearty dose of humor. The main character Mark was such a smartass and I LOVED IT. The voice and the premise hooked me in right away and kept me thoroughly engaged the whole time. My only real issues were that some of the minor characters didn't really stand out as much as they could've, and some of the science heavy bits were a little hard to follow and felt info-dumpy at times. But the human aspect--the heart of the story--was totally on point, and for the most part I just had a great time reading this!Overall, this book was exciting and fun and oh man, am I excited for the movie!

This book has been lurking around in my Goodreads feed, gaining hype, and all the positive reviews from my friends eventually got too much for me - so I had to check this out for myself. I'm glad I gave in.The Martian has so many good things going for it. First and foremost, it is a classic tale of survival against very huge odds. In this book, Mark Watney becomes one of the first people to walk on Mars but after an accident causes him to be believed dead and abandoned by his crew, it looks like he will be the first person to die there. Like Cast Away x a million, Mark must battle extremely foreign territory, the likelihood of starvation, and the possibility of technical failures.It's pretty hard to see an outcome where he isn't totally screwed.The best thing about this book is the juxtaposition between the very scientific nature of everything Mark must do to survive - gave me a renewed level of respect for how damn smart astronauts have to be - and his absolutely wonderful personality. Mark maintains his sense of humour throughout every hardship he faces - it's pretty much impossible to not be charmed by him.Here are some quotes:\u201cThe screen went black before I was out of the airlock. Turns out the \u201cL\u201d in \u201cLCD\u201d stands for \u201cLiquid.\u201d I guess it either froze or boiled off. Maybe I\u2019ll post a consumer review. \u201cBrought product to surface of Mars. It stopped working. 0/10.\u201d\u201cAs with most of life's problems, this one can be solved by a box of pure radiation.\u201d This book is part \"serious\" science-fiction, part an hilariously dark comedy that imagines a horrifying situation infused with humour and the overwhelming human desire to stay alive. It's hard to imagine that anyone who picks this up won't find themselves dragged into Mark's world, desperately needing to know what will happen to him.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Jesse (JesseTheReader)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8114361-jesse-jessethereader", "userReview": "I'm so happy that I randomly decided to pick this book up!

I\u2019m stranded on Mars. I have no way to communicate with Hermes or Earth. Everyone thinks I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m in a Hab designed to last thirty-one days. If the oxygenator breaks down, I\u2019ll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks down, I\u2019ll die of thirst. If the Hab breaches, I\u2019ll just kind of explode. If none of those things happen, I\u2019ll eventually run out of food and starve to death. So yea. I\u2019m fucked.\u201dWhen I read the line \u201ckind of explode\u201d I couldn\u2019t help thinking of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie Total Recall, face contorted, eyes bulging as the oxygen deprived atmosphere of Mars was about to detonate his head. \nI\u2019ll wait for the next mission to a blue planet thank you very much.Mark Watney, Mars astronaut, has a lot to worry about. It is hard to say if he has more to worry about than Douglas Quaid/Hauser (Arnold\u2019s character in the movie). At least he doesn\u2019t have people trying to kill him on Mars. In fact, when his fellow astronauts left he effectively became:EMPEROR OF MARSIt might be the shortest reign in history. \u201dMars keeps trying to kill me.\u201dHe amends that thought with:\u201dMars and my stupidity keep trying to kill me.\u201dWatney is far from stupid. He scavenges like a futuristic version of Robinson Crusoe from the left over debris of the Hermes crew\u2019s hasty departure. The incident that \u201cended\u201d Watney\u2019s life had them in a panic. \u201dReports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.\u201dHe finds a whole memory stick of seventies sitcoms to keep him occupied and more importantly stuff to keep him alive. Watney becomes the first farmer on Mars. He knows he doesn\u2019t have enough food to last until the next mission to Mars is scheduled so he has to improvise. Luckily the crew was to be there over the Thanksgiving holiday and for morale purposes NASA sent along potatoes with those all important eyes intact. \u201dMy morning piss goes in a resealable plastic box. when I open it, the rover reeks like a truck-stop men\u2019s room. I could take it outside and let it boil off. But I worked hard to make that water and the last thing I\u2019m going to do is waste it. I\u2019ll feed it to the water reclaimer\u2026.Even more precious is my manure. It\u2019s critical to the potato farm, and I\u2019m the only source on Mars. Fortunately, when you spend a lot of time in space, you learn how to shit in a bag. And if you think things are bad after opening the piss box, imagine the smell after I drop anchor.\u201dWhen he finds a way to communicate with Earth in one of his more spectacular MacGuyver moments they tell him that he is going to have to drive to another site where there is a rocket ship, already delivered, waiting for the next mission. He will drive on terrain that looks like this: \nThe ship is in Giovanni Schiaparelli\u2019s crater. Watney being Watney has a few juvenile observations about his arrival at the crater.\n\u201dTomorrow night, I\u2019ll sink to an all-new low!Lemme rephrase that\u2026Tomorrow night, I\u2019ll be at rock bottom!No, that doesn\u2019t sound good either\u2026.Tomorrow night, I\u2019ll be in Giovanni Schiaparelli\u2019s favorite hole!Okay, I admit I\u2019m just playing around now.\u201d The science is unbelievable and since Andy Weir was a fifteen year old prodigy and is obviously still extremely bright in middle age I have to believe him that he has this all figured out. Watney injects humor as he explains his innovative scientific brilliance which at times had my eyes glazed over trying to keep up. So even as you are getting overwhelmed by the science Weir will elicit an eye roll from the more sophisticated reader. He might even inspire an outright chortle if you are of the low brow variety of humor lovers. I must be more of the pan-humor variety as he elicited a wide range of sniggers, snorts, and raised eyebrows from me. \u201dI tested the brackets by hitting them with rocks. This kind of sophistication is what we interplanetary scientists are known for.\u201dThe one thing that might save your life on Mars, Earth or any other planet you might want to visit is something that NASA didn\u2019t invent.\u201cAlso, I have duct tape. Ordinary duct tape, like you buy at a hardware store. Turns out even NASA can\u2019t improve on duct tape.\u201d Watney worships duct tape and given the hairbrained ideas he puts into practice he needs miles and miles of it. \nIt turns out duct tape has a variety of uses for providing additional support. We are such an ingenious species. Weir convinced me that Watney could live on Mars for over a year while awaiting rescue. With mangled equipment, a harsh unforgiving terrain, and the ever present, one more thing going wrong, depression that Watney has to overcome everyday, this reader started feeling the pain of failure and the elation of success right along with him. As the world learns he is alive humanity began rooting not for the American to live, but for the human species to triumph. In the 1970s when I was old enough to watch what NASA was doing and marvelled at our ability to do the impossible. It was a time when absolutely anything seemed achievable. We\u2019d had leadership that insisted that we needed to go to the moon. We still built things, now it feels like the monuments of our times are being built other places. I do think we all miss having a common goal. Something that we all feel we are a part of, something larger than ourselves. With a space program gutted and the idea of a manned mission to Mars staggeringly expensive it makes me realize how lucky I was to grow up in a time when it really felt like the impossible was possible. I\u2019m probably the last of the optimists who still believes that we have to go see it; we have to put our footprint on it; we have to scatter our debris around and say \u2018yes we were here\u2019. We need a Mark Watney to be lost on Mars so we have something to cheer for that brings us together as a species. Besides book reviews I also have started writing movie reviews.

(although i started experiencing cramped space-madness after about 6 hours, so i doubt i'm going to mars anytime soon.)so many people i know LOVED this book. and so many people i know HATED this book. and as is usually the case with rabidly divisive books, i find myself smack in the middle, perplexed (but pleased) by the passion on both sides. it's a fine book - a pretty good balance of things i enjoyed and things i enjoyed less.things i enjoyed less:the reason i don't read a lot of sci-fi is because my grasp on sci is pretty slippery. and this book is one long celebration of math and chemistry and physics and etc. and also airlocks. i don't like airlocks. which is a weird thing to not like, i suppose, but the same way Moby-Dick; or, The Whale bored me when melville fangirled over rope for a million pages, this one izza lotta descriptions of spacecraft bits and the mechanics of airlocks and stuff that's wicked important if you are being an astronaut but is boring to me reading about it and i totally glazed over whenever anything had to be secured onto an airlock and depressurized. but what's really frustrating is that for all the attention to detail/accuracy when it came to the math (i assume/i trust), the book's pretty flippant with the psychology. watney is all relentless optimism and unflagging \"can do\" attitude and dick jokes, with very few signs of depression or fear that isn't phrased in the form of a joke. weir tried to blanket over this \"lack of meltdown\" with that brief mention that watney is the class clown whose jokiness becomes heightened under stress, but seriously - there are more tears in any given episode of project runway than in this book about a man abandoned on mars and left completely alone for 2 years facing ever-escalating dangers and setbacks. and the writing is definitely problematic. there is so much repetition, and so many times watney starts off a paragraph with \"remember\" as in \"remember when i mentioned this-and-that?? well, now it is coming back into play in this situation razzmatazz!\" it's not great for narrative flow, and it's a little insulting to assume your readership can't remember things that happened during the course of the book. and this tic is doubly perplexing when you \"remember\" (remember???) that watney's entries are ostensibly directed at other astronauts/scientists who wouldn't need science explained to them, and certainly wouldn't need the prod to remember it. the ending is bad and too abrupt. there's not much else to say about that.but there are also things i enjoyed:i love survival books, so all the high-stakes DIY macgyver \"lemme fix it with glue!\" stuff was entertaining, when it didn't require me to recall stuff i learned failed to learn in high school. i also love lateral thinking puzzles, so i appreciated watney's process of arriving at unconventional solutions to problems i will never face. bonus points for when the fix was some unpretty punk rock janked-up solution, especially when it freaked out the scientists on the ground. and i like watney's blithe attitude - to a point - To them, equipment failure is terrifying. To me, it's \"Tuesday.\"i preferred it when he was being cowboy-practical to when weir was forcing the humor. which - i know a lot of readers have a problem with the quality of the humor, but as someone who says \"that's what she said\" pretty often daily, the juvenile nature of the humor didn't bother me, and i did giggle at his consumer review of his laptop:Brought product to surface of Mars. It stopped working. 0/10.but it just felt like wherever weir could stick a joke, he'd stick a joke, and it became over-bedazzled with humor. although, considering this book treats watney's situation as reality t.v. for those still on the ground, and reality t.v. tends to amplify its participants with \"must be entertaining at all times\" fervor, this isn't entirely inappropriate after all.another frustration i had was how much i enjoyed all the stuff that was happening on the ground and in the Hermes. it was much more interesting than equation-boy and his boob-doodling, and it was better-written: the humor was more successfully integrated, the characters were more convincingly human, and that's frustrating because it shows he can do it. so that's a \"thing i enjoyed\" buried under a complaint, i guess. but i did genuinely enjoy all the non-mars scenes, and when it would cut back to watney, i would groan like it was a bran chapter in ASOIAF. so that's me: middle-of-the-road karen who sees the book's flaws, but mostly enjoyed reading it.tl;dr: a fun book interrupted by math. ***********************************************************so, i saw the movie a couple of days ago, and i can finally weigh in on a comparison of the two. i'm definitely glad i read the book first, but at the end of the day, i'm not sure if there's an answer about which is \"better.\" book wins:some of my favorite harrowing \"OH NO\" moments from the book did not make it into the movie (like that sudden realization which sends him scurrying outside for a long time), and also some of my favorite solutions were absent (hair). and while there were way fewer perilous moments in the movie, there was a zillion times more emotional response to the problems that did occur. which is points for realism, but watching people cry or otherwise emote on the big screen is as boring and time-wasting as reading about math, so one negates the other. but overall, the most interesting stuff got cut from the movie - stuff on mars, stuff on hermes, stuff on ground, etc.movie wins:having a montage to look at while math goes on and on in a voice-over is way more interesting than me kidding myself reading the math paragraphs several times like suddenly i'm gonna get it. also, matt damon delivers the jokey bits in a way that seems natural, and there are fewer jokes overall. (although in some cases, they cut the wrong ones. #aquaman) and i guess that iron man scene. that was pretty cool. so it's kind of a tie. the movie is basically the cliffs notes version of the book - it gives you the basic gist of it, but you'll miss out on some really great scenes if you are like \"book??? too boring tl;dr.\" and if you just read the book you won't get to see the airlocks in all their glory. ***********************************************************i want to see this movie, but i know it'll kill my motivation to read the book, so it looks like this puppy is gonna have to be my airplane book this weekend. as a bonus, with my window seat i can pretend that i am an astronaut myself, albeit a really incompetent one.i apologize to my seatmates in advance.\nbook - checkastronaut ice cream pellets - checkand off we go!"}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "*4.5*Well, that was a journey.

This book was fan-fucking-tastic.It is filled with humor, it's got a adequate depiction of science that wouldn't confuse a layman like me (not sure how technically correct it is, but it sounds adequate to me, and while I'm not a scientist, neither am I a moron), it's got diversity and female scientists, the narrator is this brilliant genius while having the humor of a 17-year old DotA gamer/frat boy.

Except Mark didn't get out when he should have.\nIt was a ridiculous sequence of events that led to me almost dying. Then an even more ridiculous sequence that led to me surviving.\nThere was an accident involving lots of blood and a punctured suit (fuck), and long story short, the crew left without Mark, believing him dead (fuck).Mark isn't dead, but he's stranded on Mars and everyone thinks he's dead. So that means he's as good as dead himself. The good thing is that he's not an idiot. Mark's been given medical training (boom, stitches for his injury) by NASA. They don't send untrained idiots on board a mission to Mars. He's also trained in mechanical engineering, and he got his undergraduate degree in Botany. Pretty stupid, when it's like, a fucking mission to Mars, right? I mean, who the fuck would need to plant anything on a hostile planet? As it turns out, botany is more useful for his survival than you would think.Because now that he's alive and back in the Martian Habitat (the \"Hab\"), Mark's got to set out a plan for survival. He's realistic about his situation. He's really, really fucked. But all is not lost, he's still got the Hab. Inside the Hab is a good quantity of food, it's an enclosed environment. Mark can stay alive for some time. He's got enough food to last him about a year.\nWe were six days in when all hell broke loose, so that leaves enough food to feed six people for 50 days. I\u2019m just one guy, so it\u2019ll last me 300 days. And that\u2019s if I don\u2019t ration it. So I\u2019ve got a fair bit of time.\nHe's got enough air from the Oxygenator. He's got power cells. He's got enough water from the Water Reclaimer. The trouble is that the next mission to Mars isn't coming until four years. Mark's got to stay alive until a) they come or b) he manages to communicate with Earth. Clearly, it's a better idea to try and communicate with Earth so they can come get him.\nBut if I could communicate, I might be able to get a rescue. Not sure how they\u2019d manage that with the resources on hand, but NASA has a lot of smart people.So that\u2019s my mission now. Find a way to communicate with Earth. If I can\u2019t manage that, find a way to communicate with Hermes when it returns in 4 years with the Ares 4 crew.\nPriority right now: get enough food to last four years. That's a whole lot of calories to generate from nothing. But hey, here's where his botany degree comes in handy!Mark needs to do a lot of things, but priority #1: grow some potatoes in his Hab.\nRemember those old math questions you had in Algebra class? Well, that concept is critical to the \u201cMark Watney doesn\u2019t die\u201d project I\u2019m working on.I need to create calories. And I need enough to last four years. I figure if I don\u2019t get rescued by Ares 4, I\u2019m dead anyway. So that\u2019s my target: four years.\nIt's not a foolproof plan.\nI have an idiotically dangerous plan for getting the water I need. And boy do I mean *dangerous*. But I don\u2019t have much choice.\nIn fact, it's downright fucking dangerous at times.\nAs you can see, this plan provides many opportunities for me to die in a fiery explosion.Firstly, Hydrazine is some serious death. If I make any mistakes, there\u2019ll be nothing left but the \u201cMark Watney Memorial Crater\u201d where the Hab once stood.Presuming I don\u2019t fuck up with the Hydrazine, there\u2019s still the matter of burning hydrogen. I\u2019m going to be setting a fire. In the Hab. On purpose.If you asked every engineer at NASA what the worst scenario for the Hab was, they\u2019d all answer \u201cfire.\u201d If you asked them what the result would be, they\u2019d answer \u201cdeath by fire.\u201d\nAnd thus we watch the Mark Watney show as he struggles to grow potatoes on Mars and create water out of thin air. And it's really, really thin air, BECAUSE IT'S MOTHERFUCKING MARS.Meanwhile, back on Earth, all is not lost! A glorified photo technician (ok, she's got a master's in Mechanical Engineering, but all she's doing for NASA is looking at pictures) finds some odd signs on Mars. Shit's there that wasn't there before. It's not Martians, so it's gotta be Mark. He's alive! Sound the bells! Hallelujah! Well, shit, now how do they get him out of there? How do they communicate when there's no way of communicating? Will Mark be able to survive before NASA comes to rescue him? Will NASA be able to find a way to communicate with Mark?\n\u201cHe\u2019s stuck out there. He thinks he\u2019s totally alone and that we all gave up on him. What kind of effect does that have on a man\u2019s psychology?\u201dHe turned back to Venkat. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s thinking right now.\u201dLOG ENTRY: SOL 61How come Aquaman can control whales? They\u2019re mammals! Makes no sense.\nThe Setting: Well, it's Mars. What did you expect? There's um, craters, dry dust, and more craters and more dry dust. Just kidding. We spend most of our time within a contained environment, and to be honest, it's not that important. What makes the setting believable is the science that's presented to us, in entirely layman's terms. There's a lot of concepts to understand, and Mark does a fantastic job of breaking science in a way that makes it feel real while making it credible and easy to comprehend.\nI\u2019m going to use the RTG.The RTG (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator) is a big box of Plutonium. But not the kind used in nuclear bombs. No, no. ThisPlutonium is way more dangerous!Plutonium-238 is an incredibly unstable isotope. It\u2019s so radioactive that it will get red hot all by itself. As you can imagine, a material that can literally fry an egg with radiation is kind of dangerous.\nI'm a fan of science, but I avoid the hard shit when I can. I'm not the smartest person in the world, and technicalities beyond the basic grasps of physics, chemistry, and biology hurts my head. I can understand science. I just choose not to sometimes, and I avoid the cold, hard technical stuff when I can. I can break down most of the basics (like a truly laughable dystopian global-warming scenario) but anything more than that taxes me. Look down upon me if you will. I had no problems understanding and believing any of the scientific concepts in this book. This book may use science extensively, but it is so well-described and so well-drawn and explained that it doesn't feel like a science-fiction book at all.\nI'm turning my pee into rocket fuel. It's easier than you'd think.Urine is mostly water. Separating hydrogen and oxygen only requires a couple of electrodes and some current. The problem is collecting the hydrogen. I don't have any equipment for pulling hydrogen out of the air.If I survive this, I'll tell people I pissed my way into orbit.\nThe humor:\nI chipped his sacred religious item into long splinters using a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. I figure if there\u2019s a God, He won\u2019t mind, considering the situation I\u2019m in.Ruining the only religious icon I have leaves me vulnerable to Mars Vampires. I\u2019ll have to risk it.\nMark is a damned funny narrator. This may be projection, but I see a lot of my own personality and humor in him. I'm such a humble person, aren't I? He's just like me, only wittier, funnier, smarter, and 1000x more brilliant. But I'm prettier, so I'm sure that makes us just about even.There's a lot of geeky jokes, involving NASA's tendency to overspend on, well, just about everything.\nOne thing I have in abundance here is bags. They\u2019re not much different than kitchen trash bags, though I\u2019m sure they cost $50,000 because NASA.\nAnd computer-related jokes that might go over the heads of people who don't fuck around with computers for fun.\n\"We updated Pathfinder\u2019s OS without any problems. We sent the rover patch, which Pathfinder rebroadcast. Once Watney executes the patch and reboots the rover, we should get a connection.\u201d\u201cJesus what a complicated process,\u201d Venkat said.\u201cTry updating a Linux server some time,\u201d Jack said.After a moment of silence, Tim said \u201cYou know he was telling a joke, right? That was supposed to be funny.\u201d\nThe Character Development: This is one of my few complaints. Mark is incredibly cheerful, and this is very hard to believe. He is fucked, but he makes a joke out of it. This might work, except that for almost the length of the entire novel, he is constantly funny and optimistic about it. He jokes about his own death. He jokes about the fact that he might end up a a handful of dust on Mars. Everything is humorous, and I like it, because I love his humor, but it doesn't make him a believable character.I wanted to see his despair. I wanted to feel his loneliness. I wanted to see him suffer, to FEEL him suffer because it's a really, really fucking screwed up situation. Mark's attitude makes him a fun character to read, but it doesn't make him feel realistic.\n[12:04]JPL: We\u2019ll get botanists in to ask detailed questions and double-check your work.

He was the 17th human to set foot on Mars, and the first human to be abandoned there after being mistaken for dead. There's no way in hell he has enough supplies to last until a dubious chance of rescue (if NASA even figures out that he in fact is very much not dead).

So I'll amend that:Mars and my stupidity keep trying to kill me.\u201d\nMark, however, embarks on the determined survivalist adventure unrivaled since the time of Robinson Crusoe (and lacking the blatant and now painful colonialism of Defoe's protagonist).

And duct tape. Can't forget the duct tape.\n\u201cAlso, I have duct tape. Ordinary duct tape, like you buy at a hardware store. Turns out even NASA can\u2019t improve on duct tape.\u201d\u201cYes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped.\u201d\nMacGyverism is great, yeah. But what makes this book my literary soulmate and more addicting for me than a bag of crack laced with meth and sprinkled with chocolate (or whatever the drugs of choice may be now) is Mark Watney's near constant wisecracking that is EXACTLY the humor I *get* and I (sadly, perhaps) inflict on others.[NASA guy on Earth]: \u201cWhat must it be like?\u201d He pondered. \u201cHe\u2019s stuck out there.

They\u2019re mammals! Makes no sense.\u201d\nAh, the sheer awesomeness of dorky humor peppered with bits of science that probably would work if used by someone who, unlike me, was a bit more experimentally-engineering inclined. Ah, the silly lowbrow puns that never fail to make me chuckle. Ah, the deadpan humor that never gets old. Ah, the beauty of never taking yourself too seriously. Mark Watney, you are my literary soulmate.\n\u201dI tested the brackets by hitting them with rocks. This kind of sophistication is what we interplanetary scientists are known for.\u201d\u201cRuining the only religious icon I have leaves me vulnerable to Mars Vampires.

I read the entire thing in one sitting, making it probably the best way to pass 8 hours that I can think of. Maybe it helps that I came to the book with no expectations, except the hope that I might get my next 'fix' for my inner space geek. Well, what a fix! The story is a fast-paced, compelling adventure across Mars and offered everything I wanted and more. I was behind Mark Watney the whole way, from the moment he wakes up alone with his crew gone, to his eventual rescue attempt. It helps that Mark is a great character with a hilarious internal dialogue, I warmed to him quickly and found myself rooting for him as I turned the pages. Yes, this book is sciency, but it needed to be. That's what makes it feel so authentic. It's the kind of book I'd like my future children to read, to help them understand the importance of science. It offers a perfect demonstration of how something seemingly dry and theoretical can have practical applications, and even save your life.This book isn't for everyone, there are no little green people roaming the surface of Mars or any Roland Emmerich style hi-jinx, so leave your fantasy head at home.

As a result, serious injury has been reported, to include corneal abrasions, iritis, and sprains of the lateral and medial rectus muscles.Luckily, there is a cure.The Martian, consumed in single doses, has been clinically proven to reduce the instances of ocular wounds in critical readers, especially those familiar with orbital dynamics, physics, chemistry, biology, and common fucking sense.**DISCLAIMER**The most common side effect from reading The Martian is emotional instability brought on by rapid changes in the reader\u2019s mood as they follow the daily mission logs of the main character, Mark Watney, and his struggle to survive on a planet that humans clearly have no business being on.Other common side effects include drowsiness due to lack of sleep from being up until four o\u2019clock in the fucking morning because you couldn\u2019t put the book down because things keep happening and JESUS CHRIST, HOW HASN\u2019T HE DIED YET, as well as pain. This pain was typically caused by unintentional headdesking while at work the day after because you didn\u2019t get any sleep the night before and were therefore rendered borderline-narcoleptic.In extreme cases, more severe side effects have been reported. The Martian is not recommended for those suffering from high blood pressure, as the reading of this book may aggravate this condition and lead to a sometimes fatal response known as A FUCKING HEART ATTACK.Those with diagnosed addictive personalities should not read The Martian, as it has proven in clinical trials to be highly addicting. The Martian also carries a risk of withdrawal symptoms, the most common of which is a general malaise and apathy for the real world and everything in it.The Martian may worsen some medical conditions, especially during the withdrawal stages as you move on to other, less well-researched literary works, to include:- Irritability that you can\u2019t find a decent sci-fi book to save your life- Irritability that some authors seem too lazy to even use Google- Irritability that some authors think they can make up their own laws of motion- Irritability that no one seems to realize how differently EVERYTHING works in zero-gravity- Basically irritability in general when reading other \u201cscience-heavy\u201d booksYou should not read The Martian if you have a known allergy to science. Those who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should not read The Martian if they in any way fear that the amount of calculations within it might somehow turn their unborn fetus into a socially awkward math freak.The Martian, like seemingly all prescription drugs, should not be read if you are currently taking an MAOI, as this can cause vaguely-worded, but serious, life threatening\u2026things.The Martian has been approved for the use of critical readers by the FDA, the PFC, the WHO, the CDC, and the CQQ (okay, I\u2019m just making shit up at this point).Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Alejandro", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/665584-alejandro", "userReview": "Mission Control to Reviewer One...Reviewer One, here.

Presented to you thanks to the sponsorship of \"The Martian\"'s Quotes...\nNo plan survives first contact with implementation.\nCNN: In your words, please tell us what do you think about the characters on The Martian?R1: The characters is a strong element on this novel. There are several minor characters with really great moments like Rich Purnell and Mindy. Also the Hermes' crew is absolutely great. However, the main character, Mark Watney, while at first was quite great, at the end, it's a pill hard to swallow since it's like a weird combination of Einstein and Seinfeld. He recites too much scientific facts, math stuff, etc... in the middle of humoristic remarks. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the effort of making this story as realistic scientific possible but sometimes was like wanting to read a novel but ending with a college book. I am a Trekker geek/NASA fan, so technobabble is part of my life but even so, it came a moment in the novel that I wished that the author didn't explain me with so many details how all that was going to work and just do it! Also, while funny at first, I started to get pissed with Watney for his recurrent complains about entertainment material of his fellow crewmates. Everybody was able to pack laptops and/or USB drives with their own TV series, books and music, so why didn't you do the same Watney? If you are so brilliant to make so many repairs and adaptations, why didn't pack your own entertainment material of your preference and stop complaining of what other people likes?We will be back after this quote...\nTurns out even NASA can't improve on duct tape.\nWelcome back to CNN's Reviewer One Report.CNN: What do you think about the story on the novel?R1: The premise of the story is a powerful one and quite attractive to get readers. It's amusing that on the synopsis is compared with \"Apollo 13\" meets \"The Castaway\". I guess that the author was already trying to get Tom Hanks for the imminent film adaptation. However, I think that this is much like \"Gravity\" taking the next step in difficulty. Sandra Bullock is left alone around orbit of Earth and trying to get back to the planet. Here, Mark Watney is left alone on Mars and trying to get back to Earth. I loved the tension on \"Gravity\" but you are only viewing the angle of Bullock, so I appreciate a lot that in this story after some chapters with only Watney, you starting to get chapters of what is going on back on Earth, in NASA, and also with the crew of the Hermes. Even better that the story involves the Chinese Space Program denoting that not only NASA is our only chance to get to the final frontier as a global society. That was vital to keep me hooked to the book. We will be back after this quote...\nMy asshole is doing as much to keep me alive as my brain.\nWelcome back to CNN's Reviewer One Report.CNN: What do you think about the style of the novel?R1: I like it since the author alternates regular paragraphs of text with some enhanced text simulating the communication used through electronics. If I have to criticize something, I humbly think that the use of flashback wasn't of my taste. I love non-linear stories, but here, I think that it could be better to introduce the whole crew and then knowing who is left behind, also, some \"flashback paragraphs\" inserted explaining in a slowly way how things that they were made will cause troubles on the story were unnecessary.We will be back after this quote...\nAstronauts are inherently insane. And very noble.\nWelcome back to CNN's Reviewer One Report.CNN: Closing our interview, what was your overall reading experience with the novel?R1: I think that it could be quite better with fewer pages and/or less too much detailed explanations full of scientific facts impossibly to retain in your head. Also, after several twists and trials, you get to a point in the reading where the ending became predictable so, you still get to read a lot of pages just to confirm what you know has to happen or the whole novel would be a failure. Also, thinking about that subliminal obsession of having Tom Hanks in the stellar role, well, I think that one should add \"Saving Private Ryan\" since the premise here is the same of impossible to believe. On \"Ryan\", you have to believe that the US Government did the math that one mom between thousands had lost all her sons but one, so the Allied Forces will authorize a whole squadron to get out of the battlefield to one non-relevant soldier. Here, on The Martian, you have to believe that it's okay to spend hundreds of millions of dollars just to save one man's life. Even the author made a speech justifying that exposing that there supposedly billions of people who thinks that it's okay that. I think that that's the \"illusion of control\". You get better with yourself since your government was able to save one single life in another planet spending hundreds of millions of dollars while every single day, hundreds of people die for wars, hunger, crime, domestic violence, etc... around this world, but in that way we all can sleep at night. And don't get me wrong. I am a supporter of the Space Program but if shit happens, well, I don't think you should spend hundreds of millions of dollars in a diaper, or we won't be able to grow up as humankind and exploring outer space.If I get left behind in another planet, don't worry for me, I will do a schedule to read books, watching films and TV series as much as possible the food, water and air may last and then I will take the lethal morfine shot. Sure, since I am Catholic, I don't know how I will get through Customs at Heaven but at least I wouldn't worry of being the reason of using hundred of millions of dollars that they may be used to take care for a lot of more people than only me.\nNow that NASA can talk to me, they won't shut the hell up.\nNuff' said.

This is one of the most boring books I've ever had the displeasure of reading.I was really looking forward to reading this book. Everyone was so enthusiastic about it.

Then if I science science science, science.Great! [Insert lame joke here].Now imagine this repeating 1,000 times.Watney's stranded on Mars - there's no one there for him to interact with. Also, he's apparently a person with no human feelings. Seriously. There's no doubt, worry, fear, anger or despair - even though he's stranded on a desolate wasteland and his death is imminent. Weir doesn't even make an ATTEMPT to channel human emotions at any point in the novel. I don't know whether this is because he is a terrible author, struggles with lack of feeling himself, or, what I most suspect: that this is an extremely intelligent man's daydream about how someone could survive on Mars and NOT a novel. The book is like a science textbook with random lame jokes sprinkled on top. NO - more as if someone had asked Weir to write a thesis on how to survive on Mars, and yet allowed him to throw in as many \"fucks\" and lame jokes as he wanted. Whichever it is, it wasn't what I would consider a novel.Then, you have Earth. What is going on there? We have multiple people on Earth. Perhaps these people will provide us with the dialogue and human emotion I'm craving.Mmmmm-mmmmm, nope. This is how Earth goes:PERSON A: Science science science.PERSON B: Well, my theory is science science.PERSON C: We'll have to do science science science.PERSON A: Fuck you!PERSON B and C: Working for the government sucks, ha ha ha.That's it. That's the riveting emotion you get here. Not even a semblance of any human relationships or interactions that aren't based on scientific discussions.I was attached to and cared about exactly zero people in this book. I didn't care if Watney lived or died. I didn't care if the people on Earth discovered he was alive or not. I didn't care. Nothing Weir wrote made me feel anything for anyone in this novel.I'm willing to bet that Weir is a very intelligent man and a great software engineer. But he's NOT a great author. This book was horrible. I could have easily and happily DNFed at any point in this book. The only reason I made myself finish it was so that I could write this review and express my opinion as someone who had read the whole thing.Tl;dr - Boring, bloodless and completely devoid of any humanity. A textbook with some jokes scattered here and there. I can completely understand why my engineering friends IRL are going apeshit for this book, however, it holds no appeal at all for me.The movie, even if it sucks, will most likely be 10x better than this. There's no possible way it could be worse.Famous last words, Carmen.LOL We'll see."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "4.5 stars This book is nothing short of spectacular. It is insanely well-researched, and it's impossible not to be charmed by Mark Watney's hilarious sense of humor, or jeez-MY-brain-is-filled-with-absolutely-useless-information-impressed by his smarts, ingenuity, and spirit.I will say that after a few chapters, I started skimming some of the more technical parts of what he was doing to survive. I normally love this stuff, and certainly I absolutely DID enjoy much of what was here and sincerely appreciated the amount of research and experimentation that went into his Mark's scientific calculations. But there is a lot of it, hah, and I started feeling a little antsy, even with the irrepressibly funny narrative. SO MUCH MATH.Fortunately, the POV then switches and we start seeing what's happening on the ground and other places. The action-packed plot is streamlined and exciting, the characters are memorable, and overall, the writing is immensely engaging and entertaining. Highly recommended if the summary intrigues you at all, and obviously a must read if you're a fan of science fiction or survival stories. And the ebook's only $2.99 right now! That's a fucking bargain for the amount of awesome crammed into these pages.So impressed this was a debut--I hope we get many more books by this author in the future. And this is going to make one hell of a movie."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "How many exclamation points can you shove into one book?Time to start off 2015 with an unpopular opinion: I did not like how Andy Weir wrote The Martian. He writes science well, and his background in research and technical prose shows, but by page 100 the style of the book got repetitive. Watney discovers a problem. Watney worries for a sentence or two. Watney comes up with a solution. Watney enacts the solution with minimal struggle. Watney celebrates. Rinse and repeat.I also have no idea how Watney even operates as a character. His way-too-frequent exclamations (yay! yay! yay!), his somewhat offensive commentary (please do not ever use \"rape\" in a joking context), and his lack of introspection left me bewildered. His rampant optimism felt unrealistic in the context of his situation, and Weir developed his other characters in a similar one-dimensional, stereotypical, and disappointing way. I kept asking: does anyone feel traumatized by this at all? Do any of you suffer from any psychological repercussions of having a teammate or a coworker or an admired astronaut left behind to die? Even the dialogue came across as too-good-to-be-true, with every conversation ending on a neat note that made me roll my eyes.I have no doubt that the movie of this book will succeed, or at least it will feel more natural than its source. My overall thoughts on The Martian center on its lack of introspection and repetitive descriptions of action, its disconcerting lack of characterization, and the drought of struggle each of the characters underwent. Watney faces a difficult situation, but I at no point in my entire reading thought he would suffer, based on his Pollyanna tone. However, I would still recommend this story to those who enjoy sci-fi or find its synopsis intriguing; my review rests in the minority."}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "Mark Watney. I just can't even tell you how much I love this character. I think he may just be on the list of my favorite male characters ever. The dude is stranded on Mars..with no one. Does he cry? Well, only sometimes. Does he fight against the planet from hell? Heck yes! Everywhere I go, I'm the first. Step outside the rover? First guy to every be there! Climb a hill? First guy to climb that hill! Kick a rock? That rock hadn't moved in a million years!\nI did get lost in some of the science of this book..but who cares? I might have learned something. If I ever get trapped on Mars I would probably die in 2.5 seconds. I do have confirmation on something that my husband tells me constantly. Duct tape fixes everything!\nMark Watney is full of snark and is probably the smartest character I've even had the pleasure of reading in a novel. He does find himself trapped with Disco music and bad seventies TV. One of the comments he makes is that women don't line up for botanist/nerds. Dude... start the line behind me please!"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "Has anyone not heard of this book yet?I see one hand up there towards the back! You! Yes, the one next to the potted fern. Ok. Well, then this review is for you. Everyone else, feel free to hit the buffet!Pile your plate high! I've been trying to get rid of that seafood salad for a few days...Does The Martian really need one more glowing review?No. No, it does not. But I'm going to do it anyway. Because even though I'm the last person on the planet to read this one, I still feel the need to put in my two cents worth. So this is set in the very near future, when manned missions to mars are somewhat commonplace, but not all futuristic and cool. The technology is much like moon landings...just farther away. Nobody watches the launches anymore, and nobody remembers who the crew members are anymore. But everything changes when a freak accident strands astronaut Mark Watney on Mars.In a crazy-bad storm on the surface, Watney gets stabbed with flying debris, knocked away from his crew, and his suit's vital readings flatline. They're forced by the storm to abandon the mission, and head home weighed down with the knowledge that their friend and crew member was dead. The memorial service on Earth for Mark was lovely.Except he's not dead. Due to some sciency mumbo-jumbo, his suit sealed itself around his coagulating blood, and he wakes up all alone on a planet that's determined to kill him.However, he's a really smart boy with a good sense of humor, and those two things carry him through the rest of the story. He knows that another mission is scheduled to land several years down the road, and after getting to (relative) safety inside this dome/tent/trailer-thingy, he starts hatching ways to survive until they can arrive. Ok. Science isn't my strong suit. I'm not even going to pretend to tell you I understood much of anything Mark did to survive. And the downside of someone like me reading a book like this is that there's A LOT of it that blew over my head.Garble-mumble molecule + Mumble-garble molecule = Fizzy-pop moleculeWhich means Mark survives for another day!WHOOSH!Between the science (damn you, smart people!) and the diary/log way that most of this story is written, you'd think I would've hated this sucker. But I didn't! And part of the reason may have been because it's not an overly long book. I picked it up, was hooked by the first few pages, and ended up finishing it in 2 days. Watney is an accessible character that made me giggle, and I was rooting for him for his entire journey. So, yeah, I'd recommend this one.It's a smarty-pants book even us dummies can read & love!Plus, he uses duct tape. Proving, once again, there's nothing you can't do as long as you have that stuff."}, {"userName": "Julio Genao", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3977017-julio-genao", "userReview": "dan brown syndrome.which is to say, this guy has a knack for a compelling idea, but his writing is...hoo, boy.just... brutal.no soul. no poetry. all the verve of a dead body.or a software engineer... just kidding, my gorgeous software-engineer-buddies: i was teasing the author, who is one of you, not you in particular or, y'know, in general, please don't hex my laptop because you are my everything, all i want for christmas is you, i can't live if living is without you.*winsome smile*but yeah, i'll give you a quick example: look at that cover.look at how evocative it is. how it speaks of being caught up in a great rushing torrent of powers beyond your control. how it speaks of being marooned. how it speaks of being alone.welp, this book is just like that, except without any of the things i just described.the man doesn't even get around to really describing what mars looks like until somewhere after the 68 percent mark.mars!!!one of the most romantic planets in our solar system! weir's not havin' it.ain't nobody got time fo scene-setting or sensory input; let's learn about air scrubbers, hilariously inexpensive celestial transport*, and potato farming, instead.but still. the story\u2014the bones of it, the structure, the plot\u2014great fun.and i love a good macguyver arc, not trynna lie.it's good stuff.just, like... not-especially well-written, is all.naturally, the film is spectacular.________________________*seriously. i was so annoyed by how cheap everything was i went on an imessage rampage pointing out which terrestrial american aircraft cost ten times as much as the surely trillion dollar mars-to-orbit craft weir prices like he's the home shopping network. $200 million sounds like a lot, until you find out that there's a piece of software running the windscreen wipers on a b2 stealth bomber that costs more than andy weir's entire spacecraft.aaaaaaand for the nitty-gritty of where i thought this novel failed as a novel, which i chose to express in catty gifs instead of catty words as usual, go read this guy. he says what i would have said if i weren't so anxious to go read queer avengers fanfic right now."}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi", "userReview": "4.5 starsThis whole book left me stupid happy and deliriously impressed and I spent most of my time declaring:Jesse would have loved Mark Watney. I love Mark Watney. He's super smart but not just in a poindexter nerd alert bookish kind of way. Watney's got some serious problem solving skills; he's McGyver in a space suit. Give this guy a toothpick, some tinfoil and a ziplock bag and he'll build you an airplane. But don't forget the duct tape. Duct tape is awesome and I will be putting in a supply of it in order to survive the zombie apocalypse. Watney is also a funny, the glass is half-full kind of guy who gets repeatedly knocked on his ass but finds a way to get right back up again. And who doesn't love a fighter? The Martian is being referred to as Cast Away in space and that's pretty accurate as those things go. It's definitely an adventure survival story (my favorite kind), and just like Tom Hanks, Watney finds himself stranded and completely alone. The only difference is rather than washing up on a deserted island with a plethora of unopened FedEx packages, Watney finds himself abandoned on Mars with....well, you'll have to read the book to find out. There's a lot of geeked out science descriptions, but I found most of it to be pretty accessible, even to a softcore sci-fi gal like myself. There's a real balance and warmth to the story as Watney battles with the unforgiving Mars environment that wants to kill him every time he turns around. It's thrilling and edge of your seat stuff with lots of laughs built in to break the inexorable tension. Add author Andy Weir to the growing list of self-published authors who have successfully transitioned to a traditional publishing house. And there will be a movie, and I'm betting it's going to be freaking epic."}, {"userName": "Mohammed Arabey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2015", "userURL":

liked the idea that Mark\u2019s crew returns for him, and there\u2019s a lot of very good tense stuff there. However, I didn\u2019t care for the way that Mark is essentially just a helpless passenger once they launch the escape rocket off Mars. After the entire book being about him surviving by his own wits and will, letting him just be rescued in the last phase was kind of disappointing although he does come up with an idea that ends up being the spark to save him. I guess an argument could be made that Weir was trying to allow the crew to redeem themselves for abandoning him and that it required the effort of thousands of people to put him in that position, but I still wish Mark could have saved himself right to the very end.Also, it seemed odd that we got no kind of scene between Mark and Commander Lewis after he was rescued. Her guilt over leaving him becomes a major motivational plot point so it\u2019s weird that we didn\u2019t get to see the two of them together before it wrapped up.

The Martian has just reminded me why that was a shitty idea. I love sci-fi and I'm super fascinated with space, but yeah, this one didn't particularly spark anything in me. It didn't leave me hungering for the next page. It was just another audiobook that I listened to to get me to the next level in Candy Crush. But, some good points:- Very strong narration: if you listen to the audio, good choice! Kind of. The good news is, the narrator is fantastic. The bad news is, the audio makes it hard to skim pass the more boring parts like the math. You'll have no choice but to suffer through it if it's not working for you. - Excellent research: kudos to the author for all the research he did. I can't image how long it must have taken. The fact that he included all that math indicates how meticulous and deligent he is. I have nothing but respect for that. Even if it was boring to the tenth power. - Fascinating concept: if I were stuck on Mars, I'd probably lose my mind. So it did fascinate me to see what Mark would do in each situation. My fascination ended at multiplying and dividing potatoes. - Interesting characters: my favorite parts were of the characters at NASA and Mark's crew. Basically anyone that wasn't Mark. No wait, that's not fair. I think Mark did start to grow on me near the very end, but I can't say I was truly invested in if he lived or died. I would have been okay with either ending. The bad:OMG MATH WHY SO MUCH MATH MATH MATH I disliked that as soon as the book opened, Mark was counting potatoes. I understand why, and I get that the dude has to eat to survive Mars, but if you multiply that times my interest level, you'll get zero fucks. The problem I had was boredom. There just wasn't a lot happening outside of counting potatoes, multiplying water, something, something chemistry and science. It got to the point where I starting coming up with my own mathematical equations. For instance, why doesn't my rage times my boredom equal Mark's death? If only I could kill off characters with my mind. If only. So I got to the end of the book and it was a decent ending, I suppose. Again, it didn't spark any heightened suspense in my heart, I wasn't on the edge of my seat. I thought for sure this was going to be my kind of book and almost purchased the hardcover for myself. But then I remembered I don't actually like survival stories, which I guess explains quite a lot about why I didn't love it. This book would have been significantly better with aliens."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve", "userReview": "It\u2019s a good thing Mark Watney was from Chicago. For one thing, the cold winters would have prepared him for the climate on Mars. Plus, being a Cubs fan, he must have learned how to deal with disappointment, like when you get caught in a dust storm one week into a planned month-long stay on the Red Planet, a gust of wind impales you with an antenna forcing you face down onto the craggy surface with no vital signs registering from your spacesuit at which point your endangered crewmates assume that you\u2019re dead and make good their escape. The conflict needed to drive the narrative was easy to come by on Mars. Mark starts his log on the first day in survival mode by characterizing the deep doo-doo he\u2019s in. If his oxygenator were to break down, he\u2019d suffocate. If the water reclaimer were to break down, he\u2019d die of thirst. A breach in the Hab and he\u2019d \u201cjust kind of explode.\u201d Supplies that were left behind were limited, and the next Mars landing wouldn\u2019t be for years, so even if the equipment didn\u2019t fail, he\u2019d starve. Actually, deep doo-doo isn\u2019t strictly correct. With fecally enriched soil, he might have the means to grow food.Fortunately, in this battle pitting Man versus Mars, the man had evidently stayed awake in his science classes. Each crew member had two specialties. Mark\u2019s were botany and mechanical engineering, but he seemed to know a lot of chemistry, physics, computer science, and astronomy, too. This was the book\u2019s greatest strength \u2013 a real celebration of ingenuity and STEM-based problem-solving skills. Weir was apparently born to be geeky (a term I use with the utmost respect). His father was a particle physicist and his mother was an electrical engineer. Weir himself was hired as a computer programmer at a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin at the age of 15, and has been a total NASA buff for years. He is so good technically that he didn\u2019t graduate from college, which I believe is one of the new standards signifying computer wizardry. Whether it was turning pee into rocket fuel, using a highly unstable isotope (Plutonium-238) for heat, or making water from Hydrazine (burning hydrogen to mix with the oxygen in the air), Weir gets the science right. NASA scientists also verified that the code he wrote to figure the orbital mechanics was correct. I was tempted to do one of those pictorial reviews, one with Jesse Pinkman celebrating Mr. White\u2019s knowledge of chemistry with a \u201cYeah science, bitch!\u201d But someone beat me to that particular punch.For a short while I tried coming up with my own solutions to the problems that Mark faced. It made me appreciate the guy\u2019s resourcefulness even more, and it pointed out the holes in my own knowledge. Maybe I can blame it on all the econ courses I took, where the solution for opening a can of beans on a desert island is to assume a can opener. Arthur C. Clarke once said, \u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d To turn this line upside down and add half a twist, I could say that any science fiction written by Andy Weir is indistinguishable from hard science. Some readers may be put off by the technological emphasis, but I\u2019m guessing most will appreciate the factual integrity, the clever way it was applied, and the conversational style Mark used in his logs to present it.For quite a while, the book was a chronological account based on those log entries. Then it cut away to NASA where satellite photographs showed evidence of Mark\u2019s survival. That opened a whole new and necessary thread. His Earthbound crewmates entered the picture again, too. The changes in perspective quickened the pace.If I were to rate this by literary standards, it wouldn\u2019t be great. The dialog was often wooden and the ancillary characters were stick-like. Any would-be verisimilitude by way of fuck-b\u2019s, er, f-bombs were ham-fisted, and anything approaching a human feeling was seemingly beside the point. Strangely enough, though, this made me like it more. The nerdy lack of social fluency was consistent and it accentuated the appeal. Weir\u2019s joy in writing it was palpable. It was initially done as a serialized blog with feedback from friends. In interviews, we gather that Weir would be Mark Watney if he could, though his fear of flying would be a sticking point. The author/fan-boy also said that he\u2019s not as smart as Watney, but justified any super-human poise and intelligence to the fact that the guy is an astronaut. The hero worship of space travelers was genuine and kind of charming. Weir said that he also shares Watney\u2019s sense of humor, which came across as sarcastic, slightly bawdy and at times a little goofy. Speaking of humor, that, too, is a Chicago trait, or maybe you\u2019d call it a coping mechanism. Anyway, I liked it. One of his recurring jokes was to state how the disco music one of his crewmates left behind truly sucked. This is yet another Chicago thing, as my astute friend Dave can attest, having risked decapitation to witness it first-hand.Better writers would no doubt have created a protagonist full of angst and navel-centric reflection. But to me, Weir more than makes up for any dearth of emotional realism with his likable main character, an infectious enthusiasm and a sense of scientific wonder. Scanning the many great reviews of this book, it\u2019s roughly equal numbers who compare Mark to MacGyver, for one, and to Robinson Crusoe, for another. References to the Gravity and Apollo 13 movies were also apropos. I suspect Ridley Scott\u2019s movification starring Matt Damon will be quite a hit, too. [See trailer here.] If it does the book any justice at all, I\u2019ll happily go see it."}], "description": "Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.
