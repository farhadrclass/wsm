One of the '83 review blurbs describes it thus: \"A merciless send-up of the romantic novel...like a long Edward Gorey cartoon, or like Little Women as told by Stephen King.\" Honestly, I can think of no better tagline. This is a long, challenging, highly layered & surreal read. It defies total categorization, but touches upon such labels as historical fiction, post-modern fiction, literary fiction, moralistic melodrama, gothic, satire, grotesque, steampunk, pastiche, fantasy, & feminist manifesto. And while it includes aspects of all these things, it somehow manages to overturn each label in the same breath. How? I have no idea. It just does. It's an amazing example of what can be done with a love of language & genre -- but the author isn't blind to flaws & drawbacks of the past.At the barest level, Bloodsmoor is the story of the Kiddemaster/Zinn family as chronicled by a nameless narrator. Regarding the narrator (an untrustworthy lens for the story), we know only that she's a woman, unmarried, & extremely strict in terms of Christian morality. But as to her subjects...well, the reader spends 600+ pages getting to know them in great detail. These subjects are a specific branch of the Kiddemaster clan -- that is, the family of John Quincy Zinn & Prudence Kiddemaster. They have five daughters, & each suffers a different fate. Without spoiling what happens to which sister, I will say this much: one suffers a dreadful marriage, one elopes with a poor suitor, one becomes a spiritualist, one embarks on a stage career, & one turns into a cross-dressing lesbian.(Take that, Little Women. *evil cackle*) Interwoven with the Zinn sisters & their parents is a wide-ranging homage to fiction & culture of the period (Twain's cameo is particularly awesome) that explores the late Victorian period from a modern standpoint, particularly their varied reactions to technological advancement & changing feminine roles. I have to admit, my favorite uber-literary aspect was the detailed inclusion of spiritualism & its history. Spiritualism is one of my pet fascinations of the Victorian period, & I was completely hooked by the ambiguity of ___'s spirit-related experiences. Was she truly communing with the dead, or was it a manifestation of various emotional traumas? There's no simple answer. Likewise, the yes/no question re: whether spirits exist is never quite settled. But ultimately this is a satire, & the (justified) mocking of social hypocrisy comes through loud & clear. The airs & graces affected by the Kiddemasters are transparently ludicrous, while the narrator's fawning over their perfection only serves to highlight how utterly unrealistic such expectations were -- not only on the part of those who prattled the brilliance of such mores in that period, but also the over-romanticizing of those who look back on an imagined past & glorify the same false veneer of gentility. Point of fact, the satire isn't limited to the Kiddemasters & their overdone sensibility -- instead Bloodsmoor mocks everyone who reads a historical novel & expects the characters to conform to some gloried, hazy vision of past morals. The narrator continually clutches her pearls over the Zinn daughters & their escapades, protesting heartily even as she's dissecting their various fates -- and the reader can't help seeing a prurient delight in the same behavior she claims is so offensive, particularly re: anything sensual: ___'s hyperactive sex drive, ___'s crossdressing, or ___'s wifely duties (which include hoods, S&M, & erotic asphyxiation -- see, I wasn't kidding about the grotesque aspects :D)....And on that equally prurient note, I'll wrap this epic review. Overall this was an engrossing read, but it's definitely not for everyone. The language is extremely dense & takes getting used to. The plot is non-linear & skips from present to past to future according to the narrator's whim, & there are so many subjects covered that it's unlikely everyone will be interested in everything. (Indeed, the sections discussing John Quincy's educational philosophy were a slog for yours truly.) But if you've got the patience & the sense of humor to appreciate the various layers, this is an excellent read."}, {"userName": "Lolly K Dandeneau", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau", "userReview": "For those who think it's an actual ROMANCE, it's not. What a satire, someone on amazon likened it to an Edward Gorey cartoon, I think that nails it beautifully!Finished it last night, what a long journey. I can understand how there were readers that could not get through it, knowing many people like short and sweet. I do think they missed out though. It's dark and humorous and it cannot be denied Oates is one hell of a prolific writer. This novel was like walking through a labyrinth full of godless creatures. I imagine Oates became, for the duration of creating this story, a member of the Zinn family. A delightfully dark, strange read full of the fruit I love to devour in novels."}, {"userName": "Northpapers", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1854890-northpapers", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates comes off as humorless most of the time. Not that I expect her tales of rape, hauntings, violence, isolation, infidelity, and despair to be lighthearted. But just as I expect any good humor writing to depict a kind of pain, I expect depictions of pain to have their own sense of humor. From my little worldview, it's part of being an honest writer.In fact, right before reading JCO's sprawling epic A Bloodsmoor Romance, I told a friend that I liked everything about her books except that they were all so humorless.Do you see where this is going, readers? Right after I made this judgment, I read a book by Joyce Carol Oates which was tragic, tangled, and consistently funny. OH, THE IRONY!The unnamed narrator, a virgin, tries to keep her Victorian sense of propriety and decency as she details the lurid dissolution and reunion of an upper-class Pennsylvania family. She makes a great show of defending \"proper Christian\" conduct, then goes into painstaking detail about the unseemly events that bring the Zinn family into a new century.There are infidelities, sex changes, ghosts, murders, meltdowns, spies, elopements, betrayals and abandonments, all tragic in their own way. All surreal and haunting. Cumulatively, however, in the voice of their virginal, self-righteous narrator, they make for a rollicking, jeering epic of a novel.So I was wrong about JCO. In fact, I wonder if the same dark humor that infuses and carries A Bloodsmoor Romance isn't present in her other work as well. Maybe, like the narrator, I missed certain undertones and ironies in my rush to criticize.Either way, A Bloodsmoor Romance joins the ranks of full-hearted epics like Infinite Jest, Catch-22, and Lolita that manage to elicit laughter, even as they batter and dissolve the relationships and spirits of their main characters.So, I'm sure it offers Ms. Oates no small amount of relief to know that I no longer find her work humorless. In fact, Joyce, I salute you. You can be a very funny lady if you put your mind to it."}, {"userName": "Virginia", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5469482-virginia", "userReview": "JCO enriches and expands the rigid box of Victorian literature with an insidious, insistently realistic perspective. The bones of the story are true to form, with accidents of birth and the struggle between sin and virtue at every turn, sprinkled liberally with strange events of spiritual portent. As in novels of manners from Dickens & Eliot to Madox Ford (Empire thro Edwardian) we see the middle class bougeoisie desperately trying to keep their skirts out of the mud from whence they rose by at least appearing to adhere religiously to social code.Never does Oates drop the realistic ball. The reader is in on her wry modern perspective at all times yet easily suspends disbelief in a multitude of ridiculous encounters between her characters and historical personages/events. As always with Oates' work, events of the novel are well-grounded by full-fledged motivated characters, credible as associates and also-rans among Edison, duPont, Emerson, et al sages, inventors, industrialists, popular mystics of their day.What I like best about this novel: it is told in a style which is not literary-- it's the voice of the everyday reading material of the ladies and gentlemen of working, middle & upper-middle-class America, pre-Civil War through pre-WWI era-- a style which is patently ridiculous to the modern ear, exposing the foibles of the times. I've collected plenty of this stuff-- ladies' magazines, gossip rags, newspapers-- the book sounds like it was torn from the pages of a serialized potboiler. This, I believe, is the secret to Oates' success in maintaining that tightrope-walk between modern sensibility and suspension of disbelief. The style grows on you-- like stepping into a bath which is a bit too warm. As you steep in the patter of the cultural times, you develop a finer appreciation of gothic weirdness. It was the sound of clashing undercurrents: technology and communications galloped toward the future while the brakes were full on, socially."}, {"userName": "Laura J.

A Bloodsmoor Romance follows Bellefleur in the \"American Gothic\" Quartet, which also includes Mysteries of Winterthurn and My Heart Laid Bare. Like any book by JCO, if you read it and take it too seriously you will get into trouble with this book right away...even I had to adjust to it, at first I didn't like it as well as other JCO books, but it grew on me as it chugged along with the power of a long, long, long freight train hauling boxcars loaded with trunk loads of human baggage and fuel for the fire of the human spirit, and it became a dear friend (who I will miss). I learned about the book through reading The Journal of Joyce Carol Oates 1973-1982 and loved learning about her writing process, and how much she loved writing this book (which I totally relate to) and found a battered used copy somewhere in my travels, and decided to give it a whirl. Much like Bellefleur, it possesses a life of its own and at its heart beats the drum of the American Dream as it rises and falls in the rhythm of life as it is lived by the individuals in this multi-layered tale. There is a stunning realism that is blended with the wild fantasy of a \u201cgothic romance\u201d...a rogue peddler's son becoming a distinguished gentleman/inventor; runaway daughters finding their way in the world by breaking free of the constraints of familial expectations and traditions of the time. I could keep writing more...but I don't want to give it all away!

I've seen some reviews make the pitch that A Bloodsmoor Romance is the the sort of novel you'd get if Stephen King wrote Little Women, and I should tell you that those comparisons aren't adequate to describing this book. I think a better observation is is that it's a Joyce Carol Oates version of a 19th century romance about 5 daughters in the Zinn family whose lives take wholly unexpected and, for their station, very unapproved turns. To get into their individual fates in a review here would spoil the fun of discovering for yourself the treats this book has in store for the patient reader. Along the way you get kidnapping, seances, mediums, the occult, actresses, inventions, scandals, time machines, Mark Twain, Helena Blavatsky (look her up!), ghosts, disappearances, sexual kinkiness, strange deaths, and ample doses of sly humor.

JCO offers a huge, multi-layered epic gothic novel. A Bloodsmoor Romance touches on almost every gothic plot you can think of. There\u2019s romance, of course. Murder. Madness. Mayhem. Ghosts and things that rattle in the night. A sweeping family saga with a little touch of betrayal, lost love and regret. A Bloodsmoor Romance reminded me to an extent of Little Women. I found the Zinn sisters and their various fates fascinating. Deirdre\u2019s abduction sets in motion a chain of events that rips a hole in the life of the Zinn\u2019s with various other sisters running off to follow their hearts and pursue life and passion as far away from Bloodsmoor and the rest of the Zinn family as possible. A Bloodsmoor Romance is narrated by an outsider, someone who knew the family well and seems to relish in sharing the gossip of the various scandals and tragedies that befell them starting when Deirdre was taken. I thought this was an unusual choice of narrator but JCO makes it work really well. I could imagine some old spinster sneering with glee as she filled pages and pages with the scandal and downfall of the Zinn family, cackling now and then. I found the language used in A Bloodsmoor Romance a bit difficult to get to grips with at first. The prose is quite dense and I found it a bit of a hard slog for the first hundred pages or so.

This book is insane and weird and difficult to get through, and I kind of love it. Or at least, I love that it exists and that Joyce Carol Oates took the time to create such a crazy thing. It's huge and dense and full of meticulously chosen late-1800s-style-prose, and you would think it would take 20 years just to write and that whoever wrote it probably couldn't have had time to write much else in life, but we're talking about JCO here, who is an amazing force of nature when it comes to prolificness. So yeah, this is just ONE of her 70 or so books. My hat's off to you, JCO.And what is this novel even about? Hard to describe. A parody of the late 1800s in America? Well, yes, but it also goes so deep into that time period, and into each character, that it becomes legitimate literature at the same time. It's serious / not serious. I was finding it similar to, say, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell that way: written in antiquated style with tongue in cheek, and with similarly bizarre supernatural occurrences, but at the same time fully in earnest about the plot and characters. So if you liked JS&MN's style, consider this one.I was also thinking this novel might be a thought experiment, in which Oates more or less posits the question, \"What if all that crazy stuff people believed in the late 1800s was literally true?\" What if the Spiritualists really were in league with dangerous spirits? What if someone really could invent a time machine? What if a young woman wandering off on her own, though still within view of her family, really was in danger of being seized by some stranger who might appear out of nowhere (say, in a hot air balloon)? What if young women were honestly so innocent about the facts of life that they had genuinely no idea what would happen to them on the wedding night? What if a woman who starts dressing and acting like a man actually physically became a man? Because, yes, all those things happen in this book, and more. Crazy. But I kind of love it. My review from first reading in 1998, for posterity: The cover looked like a melodramatic grocery-store romance novel--it had a woman with billowing black hair and a breathtaken expression, wearing an extravagant 19th-century dress--and the back read, \"One beauteous autumn day in 1879, a sinister black balloon swooped from the skies and abducted Miss Deirdre Zinn as her four sisters gaped, mute and terror-struck. For their family nothing was ever the same again...\" If I hadn't known it was a parody, I would have been terribly alarmed and probably would have put it back on the shelves. But, having been notified of the fact, I laughed, and decided I had to read it. \"Like a long Edward Gorey cartoon, or like Little Women as told by Stephen King,\" said one review in the front. Yes. It was just my sort of thing. Altogether, Ms. Oates captures the spirit of the times quite well, deftly mixing mentions of Edison and Walt Whitman and Poe into her characters' social lives, and including an intimate personal appearance by Mark Twain. Furthermore, as this book is highly amusing and deeply interesting, and barely at all disturbing, it shows that Joyce Carol Oates is an even more versatile author than I realized. Fans of Victorian literature will be delighted at this new take on the subject."}, {"userName": "Bruce Arthurs", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20293961-bruce-arthurs", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates has been turning out novels and short stories on a prolific basis for decades, frequently enough that she's been criticized for writing too quickly, while at the same time being highly regarded in literary circles. Somehow, except for a few short stories, I'd never read any of her work until recently.A Bloodsmoor Romance was first published in 1982 and is part of the \"Gothic Quintet\" (concluded in the recent The Accursed). Judging from some of the reviews I've read, it has a reputation as a \"black sheep\" among Oates' work, with irregular and inconsistent plotting and narrative.I can see where those opinions are coming from. But I can also see, I think, what Oates was trying to accomplish with the book, not always successfully. There were moments when I absolutely loved what I was reading, and also moments when I was definitely going \"WTF?\" So my reaction is as mixed and inconsistent as the actual book is. ABR is kind of a mess, but it's a \"hot mess\".From The Urban Dictionary: 'Hot messes' are appealing for a variety of reasons, most notably because they're generally unexpected, capricious, & agonizingly provocative. Additionally, numerous contingent factors make duplication rare and continual repetition virtually impossible.  No one set of guidelines can perpetually determine what distinguishes a \"hot mess\" from an above-average train wreck. Regardless of the circumstances, you know it when you see it; because they are typically conspicuous, and obviously they are always awesome.Basics: In late 19th-century America (1879-1899), the Zinn sisters (Constance Philippa, Malvinia, Octavia, Samantha, and the adopted orphan Deidre) are the children of a gifted but irresponsible inventor who fortunately married into a wealthy Pennsylvania family, the Kiddemasters. Though the backstories of John Quincy Zinn and Prudence Kiddemaster are told in flashbacks, the five sisters' stories are the main narrative. The initiating incident of the book is when Deidre, the youngest sister, is abducted by an unidentified balloonist in a sinister black balloon.The stories of the five sisters are told by an unnamed female person of the same period and mores. The Victorian repression and denial of sexuality is paramount in the narrator's voice, augmented by a cloying American fundamentalism. Since much of the book deals with the sisters' actions in contradiction with those social codes and mores, there is much expression of disapproval from the narrator, couched in florid Victorian prose.But, by God, it's great use of overblown prose. Particularly in the early parts of the book, the rhythm and pace of the narrative is almost like poetry. There were sections I wanted to read out loud. I would have loved to hear this book done as an audiobook.Also, there are parts of this book that are just plain goddamned funny. \"Goofball\" isn't a term one usually finds applied to Oates, but for this one particular book she seems to have let her inner-goofball out at points.[full review, with some spoilers, available on my blog.In short, this book was, umm, \"interesting\". The mileage you place on \"interesting\" may vary."}, {"userName": "Jerry", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1761612-jerry", "userReview": "This is a great novel that I'd only recommend selectively. It's long (752 pages) and written in a precious mid-1800s tea-party diction. It took me about a hundred pages just to realize that this wasn't merely a tour-de-force of stylistic mimicry, but also a parody of the style so subtle that it does a balancing act from beginning to end, never falling into dismissive or belittling lampoon. Its narrator (\"the authorized chronicler of the Zinn family\") loses track of her narrative, hops around in time, censors herself with a formidable prudery from mentioning the many, many things that she finds unmentionable, and generally makes life hard for a reader who tries to make sense of the story. That story, meanwhile, is a time-warped magical-realist shaggy dog of a thing, purportedly the history of the Zinn family, its relatives the Kiddemasters, and a variety of peddlers, mystics, quacks, and powermongers in late 19th century Pennsylvania. Like many of Oates's books and stories it centers on a missing/abducted girl--in this case one of five sisters--and explores a world of oppressive gender codes and shady political forces, but it also (and in this it shares some similarities with Angela Carter's great Nights at the Circus) presents a fascinating, slightly steam-punkish picture of the end of the 19th century, especially regarding the confluence of invention, capitalism, and militarism. Its characters are spectacularly well-drawn, especially the inventor John Quincy Zinn, but also his several daughters, his wife, Prudence, and her aunt, parents, cousins, etc. As in Oates's gothic Bellefleur, her characterization balances a very persuasive psychological realism with a happy taste for the grotesque and fantastic. The imaginative achievement of the book strikes me as among Oates's most impressive. And it contains moments of pure guffaw--yawp-out-loud wisecracks, some of them anachronistic, many of them coded to the kinds of vicious in-joke ironies I associate with deeply passive-aggressive families. Yet, as I say, it's also long, convoluted, and demonically precious in its tone--the balance between tone and tonal parody is almost too perfectly sustained. It's easy to imagine readers throwing the book away in disgust. I loved it (I think it's a work of genius) and can't think of another writer who could have pulled it off.

Before starting the review I want to point out, as I do at the beginning of all of the Gothic Saga novels, that these books follow the same gothic style setting and sometimes the same historical figures popping up but do not need to be read sequentially nor do they, as far as I know, reference each other in any way.I enjoyed this tale of a family of five daughters, each of which chooses a very different fate as they leave home. What Oates manages to do quite masterfully is create five distinct personalities (more if you count the two parents, the great aunt, and other side characters) and five very different tales. Through their stories, an image of an era emerges from different angles and perspectives. It is well-written and well-researched. Some sections were certainly more interesting than others, and I found myself at times impatient for a section or perspective to end, but this was infrequent. I also found frustrating that Deirdre's perspective took so long to emerge and that her balloon was never explained (unless I'm missing some reference?), though I understand why she wasn't revealed for so long. I think Octavia's storyline was maybe my favorite, and Samantha's my least in terms of subtlety of the telling.Since the Gothic Saga books aren't necessarily linked, I don't think it makes a lot of sense to compare them, but I will say that while Bellefleur took my breath away, A Bloodsmoor Romance did not. Some of the elements didn't really come together for me, and I thought some areas were a lot stronger than others. If a turn of the century set novel about a wealthy families with supernatural and feminist elements sounds like an interesting read to you and you have some time, I say give it a shot. I'm glad I read it, and I'm off to hunt for tome three in the ongoing Gothic Saga series."}, {"userName": "Locturne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10594884-locturne", "userReview": "A great book, beautifully written (the mimicry of 19th-century prose style is amazing) and... last but not least, very entertaining. I devoured it!I loved the detailed historical background. It was nice to learn about the America of the late 19th century (I was surprised to see that Madame Blavatsky really existed and had really been investigated by the Society for Psychical Research!)The mock-19th century spinster's perspective was really fun. Like when the narrator explains that she's a virgin and of course knows nothing of man's anatomy (or even of a woman's, because she would of course never look at herself naked) and then goes on to give a detailed account of X's husband's bedroom practices.I'm so happy I discovered Joyce Carol Oates through this book \u2013 she's such a great writer. I'm definitely going to read other works by her. Warning: SPOILERS!!!In terms of plot, and because I like when everything gets neatly tied in little bows at the end of books, I would have liked Prudence Zinn to have a different character arc... I would have liked her to realise what a hypocrite she had been with her daughters, pressuring them into marriage when she herself had married for love... after first deciding to remain single all her life. She treated her daughters really unfairly, rejecting them to the end because they claimed their independence. Yet her end-of-life turnaround would have justified an ultimate reconciliation with her daughters. And it's too bad that in the end, all the daughters find solace in finding a right male companion, but never manage to really befriend each other. Every woman-to-woman relationship was a failure in the end."}, {"userName": "Mira", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19469400-mira", "userReview": "This book is the chronicle of a well-off (though not quite well-off enough) American family in the late 1800s. The narrator (a celibate maiden, as she continues to remind us whenever her natural feminine frailties interfere with the telling of the story) would like to extract from them a tale of moral inspiration and instruction, but how can she? While the Transcendentalist father and thoroughly respectable mother are beyond reproach, the lives of their five daughters shock her sensibilities. There\u2019s Deirdre, the adopted malcontent abducted by a black outlaw balloon. There\u2019s Constance Philippa, whose discomfort in her own body leads to a surreal transformation. There\u2019s Malvinia, cruel and beautiful, with those strange urges that continue to interfere with her love life. There\u2019s Samantha, the young inventor always subordinate to her father\u2019s will- until suddenly she isn\u2019t. And poor Octavia, the kindest and most obedient child, suffers such hardships- so many mysterious accidents befall those close to her, despite her best efforts to love and obey them as a good woman should!A Bloodsmoor Romance is a gothic fantasia, and the tale that emerges could be described as \u201cLittle Women gone to hell.\u201d The adventures of the Zinn daughters shock and sometimes delight the reader (though frequently at the opposite times as the narrator!) This dense and delicately-told book is packed with the grotesque and bizarre, and is ultimately a romance in the truest sense of the word."}, {"userName": "Melina O.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11127633-melina-o", "userReview": "What can I say about this book?It is set in the 19th century and written about a genteel family centered in Philadelphia's elite society. The characters of the book are all part of the Zinn family consisting of Mr. John Quincy Zinn, his wife & five daughters that include an actress, a spiritual medium, a transsexual/transgender(?), a housewife and inventor. The story is so vast and imaginative I couldn't stop reading, wondering where Joyce Carol Oates was taking me. If you're looking for a romance novel, this is anything but. Altho' there is a bit of romance, its mostly tragic but not heart wrenchingly tragic. At the same time, you can find some humor in it and appreciate the fact that the females in the book are not confined to their determinate places in society. The book can be a little difficult to read because it is 700+ pages and you would have to be committed. Plus the vocabulary used is very grandiose which makes sense for the time within the book but I can see that being a nuisance to some readers.I'd recommend this if you like a little bit of everything in your books: love, sex, murder, ghosts, abandonment, \"sexual deviancy\" etc."}, {"userName": "Camille93", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12343399-camille93", "userReview": "Awesome book!! 752 pages so it took me about 2 and a half months to read (especially with Netflix, Audible, and podcasts taking up so much of my time these days).Takes place in America (mainly Pennsylvania) in the Gilded Age, specifically 1879-1899. Follows the 5 daughters of the Zinn family, all of whom defect from social mores over the years.Opens with the abduction of the youngest (adopted) daughter, Deirdre, by hot air balloon. She later becomes one of the most famous psychic mediums of all time. Another daughter runs away to become an actress. One girl elopes while another flees her marital bed and reappears many years later after undergoing a major bodily alteration.The book is told in Victorian prose but takes diverse and fascinating subjects including transsexuality, substance abuse, and the decades-long attempts by the family patriarch, JQZ, to perfect his perpetual-motion machine.

I would probably rate it 3.5 (vs. 4) as it's definitely better than average, but I recognize that it's not for everyone either and was a pretty lengthy read. I thought the conceit of the narrator (as an observer, but somewhat participatory? It was never totally clear) was an interesting way to tell this story. The Zinn women are varied and lead unconventional lives - it led to some amusing turns in the story as the voice of the narrator was one of a more conventional woman living in the 19th century.I have not read much Joyce Carol Oates, and find her \"hit or miss.\" Her catalog is extensive, but added this based on a friend's recommendation. I look forward to exploring more of her work!"}], "description": "Set in a nineteenth century similar to our own, A Bloodsmoor Romance follows the beautiful Zinn sisters, five young women who refuse-for the most part-\"the obligations of Christian marriage.\"Full of Oates's mordant wit, and breathlessly told in the Victorian style by an unnamed narrator shocked by the Zinn sisters' sexuality, impulsivity, and rude rejection of the mores of their time, A Bloodsmoor Romance is a delicious filigree of literary conventions, \"a novel of manners\" in the tradition of Austen, Dickens, and Alcott which Oates turns on its head.Oates's dark exploration interweaves murder and mayhem, ghosts, and abductions, substance abuse and gender identity, women's suffrage, the American spiritualist movement, and sexual aberration as the Zinn sisters come into contact with some of the nineteenth-century's greatest characters, from Mark Twain to Oscar Wilde. A biting assessment of the American landscape and a virtuosic transformation of a literary genre, A Bloodsmoor Romance is a compelling, hilarious, and magical anti-romance-Little Women by way of Stephen King.", "title": "A Bloodsmoor Romance\n      \n          (The Gothic Saga #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19079313-a-bloodsmoor-romance", "average": 3.72, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385886240l/19079313.jpg", "reviews": 58, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3524.Joyce_Carol_Oates", "name": "Joyce Carol Oates"}], "type": ["Historical", "Gothic", "Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19079313-a-bloodsmoor-romance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1190508.A_Bloodsmoor_Romance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397331.A_Bloodsmoor_Romance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368331.Las_hermanas_Zinn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17383986-a-bloodsmoor-romance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5204.We_Were_the_Mulvaneys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15967.The_Falls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15972.The_Gravedigger_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15975.Blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156222.Foxfire"]}
