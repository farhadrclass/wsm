He watches me from under the hood of his jacket, reclining on a caf\u00e9 chair. I know I should report this. He\u2019s everywhere. And I mean everywhere. It almost seems like he knows where I\u2019m going to be before I know.\"\nI swear I wasn't going to review this book. I'm actually reading a bunch of \"dark\" romance/erotica books as part of a project with my college book society - we're critically examining the recent influx of these in the indie publishing world, particularly the way women are portrayed in them. And I wasn't going to review them because I knew I would probably hate them and no one wants to read review after review of negativity. I knew what I was letting myself in for and I knew it wasn't my thing. But... then this book happened.Here's the funny thing: I wasn't put off by all the dark sexy stuff and questionable behaviour. I wasn't put off by Twitch's (yeah, that's his name) need to \"break\" Lexi. I wasn't even put off when he compared her to a dog or when he carried out his psycho-stalkery crap. I expected all of that. I got it - he's a villain and we're not supposed to like him. 'kay, whatever. What did it for me - and what made me want to review this book despite everything I've said - was Lexi's stupid, stupid fucking behaviour. A few other things too, but mostly that.\n\"Once we reach my unit and he opens the door, it doesn\u2019t hit me until we\u2019re inside that he knows where I live. So why don\u2019t you feel like you\u2019re in danger? Because I\u2019m not. I just know it. I\u2019m sure of it.\"\nAnd: \n\"Not sure why I\u2019m taking orders from a man who likes to watch me from under a hood, but I am.\"\n Refer to image above^.I don't know how I made it through all the stupid in this book, I seriously don't. On top of all the \"whisper-yelling\" and \"whisper-hissing\" which is the only way people talk in this novel, and the endless amount of filler sex where Lexi waxes poetic about Twitch's beautiful dick. Ugh. My favourite (read: hated it) thing is that the first \"message\" this novel delivers is that stalkery behaviour can be a good thing. In chapter one, Twitch swoops in to rescue Lexi from a would-be rapist:\nI whisper, \u201cI just want to know why you watch me?\u201dNot answering, he states acidly, \u201cIt was a fucking good thing I was, don\u2019t you think?\u201dAn awkward, foul silence follows.\nNo!! It wasn't a good thing, you crazy ass piece of shit. This crap happens in Fifty Shades of Grey too, as well as other books. The guy acts like a douchebag/stalker/control freak and his behaviour happens to save the heroine from some tragedy or other and this is used to excuse said behaviour. What if a guy punches you in the face and accidentally knocks you out of the path of a speeding bus? Does that make him a hero?Pg 22. \n\"It\u2019s strange. He doesn\u2019t look like a predator. Certainly doesn\u2019t act like one. So what\u2019s the deal?\n1) \"Hello there, I'm Joseph Stalin, nice to meet you! Please make yourself at home. Can I get you anything? Some tea or coffee, perhaps? Oh, and by the way, I'm responsible for the deaths of somewhere between 20 and 60 million people.\"He doesn't look like a predator? They never fucking do. That's why they're so good at it. If ugly men were staring at you from the shadows, you'd be dragging your stupid ass down to the police station, am I right?2) He doesn't act like one? He stalks you. He knows your name and where you live without ever having spoken to you. Lexi, I'd hate to see your idea of a predator.Oh yeah, and... \nMy brain interrupts me with, \u201cYou do realize you just had crazy-assed sex with a homeless, crazy-assed stalker-dude, right? You also let this guy come inside you and you\u2019ve known him about a minute and a half.\u201d\nWithout any protection, I might add. She lets her stalker into her house, has sex with him, and doesn't even use a condom.Lexi is a particular brand of moron that appears a lot in romance novels. Not only is she ridiculously stupid, but we are supposed to believe she is special. A good girl. Intelligent. Kind. Caring. Above other \"slutty\" women. SO SPESHUL. She can't even dress as Cleopatra for fancy dress because she's too damn nice:\n\u201cNo, babe. You\u2019re not Cleopatra. You\u2019re an angel. And a beautiful one at that.\u201d\nWhen she visits Twitch at work, she immediately hates the beautiful woman who works for him: \n\"Her perfect red-stained lips match her perfect... everything.\u00a0I dislike this woman very muchly.\"\nAlso, I wanted to mention something else about this. I am a white woman living in Britain so I don't really have any concept of racism myself. I've seen it around me on occasion in all its ugliness, but it has never been directed at me and I won't pretend to know what it's like. So maybe I'm reading too much into this... but I felt extremely uncomfortable when Lexi scornfully refers to Ling as \"Miss Asia\". Maybe it is because Ling is treated as disposable and with disdain by everybody in this book. She is called everything from whore to skank to bitch and brushed aside by Twitch like she has no feelings whatsoever. Everything about her characterization didn't sit right with me.There are so many more quotes I could pull up for you, but I think you'll have probably worked out by now whether you can stomach this book or not. In terms of plot, it is mostly sex. With a nice big side order of angst. I also predicted the ending fairly early and I thought the \"reveals\" for Twitch's stalkery were ridiculous. His explanation didn't really make sense and wasn't particularly convincing. Oh well, what did I expect?Here's one final quote to sum up the wonderful man that Twitch is: \n\"You start this and change your mind, I won\u2019t stop.\"\nYou know what it is if someone refuses to stop when you change your mind during sex? Of course you do, you're not stupid. You're not Lexi.Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Lady Vigilante (Feifei)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2551178-lady-vigilante-feifei", "userReview": "[it\u2019s not an HEA.

Nope. I am a wuss and my fragile heart simply can\u2019t handle stories where it does not end in sunshine and butterflies. Therefore, when I discovered that Belle Aurora was writing another book I was beyond blissful. Then.Then....I find out that this book is NOT a love story. It\u2019s about love gone terribly wrong. I quote \u2013 \n\u201cAuthor Note: This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone wrong.\u201d\nI mean. What the fuck????At first I did not believe it. Not my sweet Belle Aurora who writes books that make me smile, swoon and leave me all heart-fluttery. No. She would not do it.Yes. BELIEVE IT! She did it!Belle, after reading this book....I am shattered.I am hurt.I want to curl up in a little ball and die.Yes, I do admit that it is a bit over the top and melodramatic. Oh well. You read the book and see how well you handle it.\n\n\u201cMonsters don\u2019t always lurk in the shadows.\u201d***\u201cWe\u2019re all addicted to something that takes away the pain.\u201d There\u2019s so much truth in that phase.***\u201cNot everyone can be a fairy-tale hero.\u201d He pauses a moment, then adds, \u201cThe world needs villains too.\u201d***You\u2019re nobody \u2018til somebody loves you.\n\nRaw by Belle Aurora is a book I want other readers to simply experience without any preconceived notions. Giving anything away would simply be a tragedy. Therefore, coming up with something for a review has been difficult. I will simply say this. This book is gritty. It is dark and twisted. And, my friends, this book is dirty.Alexa Ballentine is a sweet young woman who has overcome a pretty shitty upbringing. She has a great job, some amazing friends and stability. Twitch, on the other hand, is definitely not a white knight prancing around on a huge horse looking for a fair maiden to save. He is simply not a good man. Yet, the more you get to know and understand him, the more you want to believe that his hardened shell can be cracked. That there has to be some good in such a hard and warped man.But....Again....\n\u201cAuthor Note: This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone wrong.\u201d\nThis is a book about how circumstances in our lives mold us and make us who we are. This is a book about how we tend to label individuals based on what we see. This is also a book about how certain people can bring out our dark side. Raw by Belle Aurora will challenge you. It will make you uncomfortable. But, most of all, it will make you \nfeel\n. My gosh, did this book play with me. And, if I am to be completely honest, I liked it. A lot. Now, I will go back to my quiet corner and continue to sob until my broken heart recovers. Who am I kidding? I am damaged for life!****An advanced reading copy of Raw by Belle Aurora was provided to me via Sinfully Sexy Book Reviews in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Val \u2693\ufe0f Shameless \u2693\ufe0f Steamy Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11626803-val-shameless-steamy-reads", "userReview": "DNF @ 15%Okay, sooooooo......this is awkward. But I'm gonna go ahead and just call this one here. Because otherwise, I would be ripping this thing to shreds. And as highly entertaining as that has the potential to be...the only reason I would be finishing this would be so I could rate it and rip it to shreds. Which would make me an asshole. And mean. Verra mean. And while I am aware that my profile name contains the word \"bitchy,\" because TRUTH, there is a huge difference between being bitchy and just plain cruel. And besides, my \"make people cry\" quota is already full for the week, so...J fucking K people. Anyway, this book. This was supposed to be \"oooooooo\" all dark and ish, but it was reading like a parody for me. I'm that jackass in the back up there ^^^.The writing style had a very tongue-in-cheek feel to it that just didn't jive with the tone I felt like the book was trying to go for. And, speaking of the writing...I just didn't care for it, quite frankly. Everything comes down to personal preference, as they say, and this just wasn't my cup of tea. Or coffee...Or wine...Or vodka...Or rubbing alcohol any ingestible form of liquid that I would actually drink. But the main reason I am calling it quits here?Alexa.Homegirl is a social worker, but what with how selflessly holier than thou she, as the narrator, portrays herself to be, you would think she majored in Super Woman and minored in Psychiatry. When she first meets, Twitch *snort*, the H:\n\"My type of work means I come across a lot of different types of people. I know that everyone is different, but what I'm sure about Twitch is that he's a sociopath.\"\nReally? Got that within five minutes did ya?Impressive. Then...wait for this shit...regarding her neighbor:\n\"George, my bipolar neighbor, would never lay a hand on me. The guy loves me! Being a [ermagherd!] caseworker, the first time we met, I picked up on his behavior right away. I'm sure he wasn't used to what he got from me.A hug.I told George that I worked with a lot of people who suffered mental illness, and that if he felt a panic attack coming on that I would be there for him...\"\nI'm sorry. It takes a lot to offend me. But I grew up in a bipolar household. An immediate family member. And it's not something that even highly trained psychiatrists can always notice \"right away,\" let alone a simple social worker who thinks she's God's gift to humanity. And to have the fucking audacity to trivialize something complex like that by presuming to say \"I work with people with mental illness\" - like you, you poor thing! - so come on over and have your panic attack (???) with me, your random fucking neighbor, whom you just met?!Oh man, I'll be right fucking there, Super Woman! You hath cured me with your mere presence!Thank FUCK you moved in!And THEN, when the friend DARES to suggest that poor bipolar George might be violent, listen to THIS response:\n\"'Don't you do that, Nikki! That's not cool, babe.\"'Do what?' she responds, exasperated.Staring down a moment, I state, 'Stereotype.'\"\nWell, hey there, Pot. Why don't you go lecture Kettle some more about how not to be cookware. Seriously, this was just fucking ridiculous and, like I said, I'm not going to be cruel and finish this thing knowing it's headed down a road I don't want to be on.

Talk about diverse writing styles! Although it did have a touch of humor, this book was much more dark than her previous works. And I loved it! I wouldn\u2019t call it a dark and disturbing read, although it did have its moments... the words that come to mind when I think of this book are: intense, erotic, suspenseful, gritty and, well, RAW. It's not a happy love story. But hey, we we\u2019re warned...\nAuthor Note: This is not a love story. This is a story of a love gone wrong. \nAlexa is a good girl. She always has been. She had a rough life growing up, but it\u2019s brought her to where she is today. A social worker helping other kids who don\u2019t have it easy. She loves her job and her two best friends. Life is pretty good. Then she meets Twitch. \nTwitch has been watching (cough*stalking*cough) Alexa for a while now. She can feel him when he\u2019s there. He wears a hood, but she knows it\u2019s him. When she finally \u2018meets\u2019 Twitch, he saves her from someone attacking her. She should be afraid of him, maybe, but she\u2019s not. \nI know I should feel differently. I should feel uneasy. And even frightened. But I don\u2019t know. Something about this man puts my mind at rest. And now I know deep down that I have nothing to fear. Twitch will protect me. Just like he always does.\nTwitch goes from being that anonymous watcher to someone who is present in Alexa\u2019s life. He comes and goes as he pleases, but he is there with her. It\u2019s comforting for her. She finds herself missing him when he\u2019s not there. Twitch is not a good guy. He knows that. He\u2019s lived a rough life, and made his way from the bottom to the very top of the heap. He is successful, ruthless, and he looks the part- covered in tattoos. It was refreshing for me to have a \u2018hero\u2019 who wasn\u2019t a hero at all. I love a villain. The anti-hero of the story. Those severely damaged and fucked up characters. Twitch fits the bill.\n\u201cYou\u2019re what fills the whole in my heart. You saved me. You\u2019re my hero.\u201d\u2028\u201cNo. I\u2019m not. You have no idea how wrong you are. What you want me to be... I can\u2019t ever be. It\u2019s not me. I\u2019m the villain in this story.\u201d\n Regardless, Lexi finds herself still wanting him. Things with Twitch are different than anything she\u2019s used to, but he did give her fair warning.\nTwitch and Lexi together... they were combustable. It was erotic, dirty, sexy, steamy and down right HOT. Rough uninhibited sex. It\u2019s unlike anything Lexi has ever experienced. She is shocked with how much she likes it. The things that Twitch does to her, things that should scare her to death, they don't. Well, maybe they scare her a bit but mostly they turn her on. Twitch is more surprised than Lexi. This he was not expecting. Lexi is a contradiction to him. \nLexi is ruined by Twitch, just as he wanted. She can\u2019t think of anything or anyone else besides him. She knows she\u2019ll never want to be with anyone besides him again. Full of secrets, Twitch doesn\u2019t know how he feels. One minute he wants to ruin Lexi, the next he wants her forever. He has issues. But thats why I love him. Now to that ending. I will admit, I cried when reading it. I\u2019m not one of those people who needs a sunshine and rainbows happy ever after every time I read a book. That\u2019s just not how it goes all the time. Did I love how the book ended? No. But still, I\u2019m OKAY with the ending. I am, however, hoping the author decides to write a second book. I think there is so much more of Twitch and Lexi\u2019s story to tell! This book will have your heart beating out of your chest. There were a few things I found out that had me in a state of shock. The author is correct. This is a story of a love gone wrong...\nI would highly recommended this book to anyone looking for an intense, unconventional, powerful and tantalizing read. If that sounds like your cup of tea- pick this up. If you\u2019re looking for Aurora\u2019s normal lighter, fluffy, sweet and comical stuff, this probably isn\u2019t the book for you!

Then everything they do is forgiven. (because they are hot and rich)3, I knew that Twitch had hired Lexi's attacker to sexually assault Lexi long before the truth came out. It was so obvious. That was his way in from stalker, to savior. The fact that he did that disgusts me and was almost a deal breaker. Even though he wanted to hurt Lexi, his obsession with her made no sense. It also DISGUSTS me that any hero would ever plot to hurt/harm/abuse the heroine.And this should have been #1..Twitches reason for wanting to hurt Lexi was a joke. He wanted to hurt her because she was nice to him once when he was eight years old, and gave him hope of a better life? So he wanted to \"break\" her. Because how dare she give him hope!! WTF? That's a horribly weak plot!4, Oh and the moment Twitch cut that man's eyeball out and left him alive\u2026..I knew the book would end tragically!! There is a thing called revenge!!! A real Sociopath would know this.5, So Lexi takes her birth control pills daily, until she starts to have UNPROTECTED SEX on a Daily basis with a man she doesn't know, and then she forgets to take her pills\u2026\u2026and gets pregnant\u2026riiiiight\u2026 Big Ass Eye Roll Moment\u201cYou\u2019ve been fucking me for months and you don\u2019t even know my name. Who does that?That's a Damn Good question!!!6, So you hire a kid to get him off the streets from dealing, only to send him on a drug run with Happy. I knew Michael was gonna end up dead when he started working for Twitch.7. Final eye roll\u2026how do you fake a death while in a coma, cause I know that Lexi probably never left his side. So did he wake up the one moment she did leave the hospital and tell Happy, \"Hey, lets fake my death to keep her and the baby safe\" And there was no reason to fake his death after the One Eyed man was dead? Right? The EpilogueTwitch as a sociopath was pretty spot on, until the end when Twitch states that he \"cried like a baby\" when he saw his son with markers on his hand. That shit was touching as hell. I got misty too. But that is not true to the character of a sociopath.A true sociopath would not deny himself being with Lexi and his son. They are too selfish to do that. Twitch tried to push Lexi away in his office by telling her that he had hired that man to rape her, only to change his mind (3 minutes later) before she got to the elevator. Sociopaths are not saints that are able to put the needs of others first. There is no way Twitch could have stated away for 5 years.

I really enjoyed this reading Raw, Twitch and Lexi were hilarious and infuriating at times, but I had to know their story and where it would go!She's a social worker who has a soft spot for kids who've been forced onto the streets because of life at home. This makes sense since her childhood was almost exactly the same. He's a successful \"businessman\". While out one day she's attacked and Twitch comes to her rescue, this is the beginning of a compelling relationship, Twitch is intense and broody both in public and in the bedroom, he's all alpha male.He's also a crazy, hot, domineering, panty-melting, ovary-busting asshole; and I really liked him!Lexi is sweet, quirky and can be a dork at times, she's the ying to he's yang.Once he allowed her to see him, she really didn't have a chance. She was literally putty in his hands, and any inconsistencies with his story were over looked. She was mesmerised.I laughed, I got angry, I wanted to slap some sense into them and I thoroughly enjoyed it!

Honestly that is how I feel right now. It is so hard to come to terms with what I just read and type it down. All I know is that this is my first 5 star book I have read in 2014. I couldn't have asked for more of a perfect book, I couldn't. There is nothing I would have changed. Maybe something but when I think about it I am sad and happy at the same time. I know.... That is one thing I do know is that. Doesn't make any sense of me saying that when you have no idea what I am talking about but once you read it you will get me. It has been a long time since I have read a couple that compares to Twitch and Lexi. I think it has been years. Maybe never really. It just takes me that deep that I just can't compare it to any other book or character. Both of these two characters are fucked up in their own way. I feel like their relationship is so unique that is is hard not to love it and want everything to come out happy roses and everyone dances. It's fucking  RAW . The title speaks for it self. It comes down to that it is fucking damn raw and I love it that much more. I love when I start reading a book and I can't put it down for the life of me. I have to finish it just to know what is going to happen. I felt this sick feeling in my stomach through the whole thing cause it is not like any book I have read. You have no idea what is going to happen. It takes you by surprise and leaves you feeling like I said someone kicked you in the fucking chest. I do not regret anything on this. Just that I wish I would have took my time instead of being greedy and devouring the fucking book in one night.   \u201cMonsters don't always lurk in the shadows. Sometimes they hide in plain sight.\u201d \n I am not quite sure where it came from that this book is dark. I know everyone has their own titles on what they think is dark. To me this is not dark in no way shape or form. I never got that feel from this book and nothing made me think that it was dark. I love my dark reads those are my favorite. I am glad that I was not told this book was dark before I read it because then I would have gotten a more hyped up of the darkness that was suppose to be coming out of it. So I am glad that I did not hear that before I read it. But it kind of throws me off that some say this is dark. Anyhow just wanted to throw that out there..... Twitch, is not the good guy in this book. He is the villain and I must say I fucking love the villains the most. For some reason they draw my attention more then the good ones. And fuck man, Twitch makes the perfect fucking villain. I could keep him and eat him up all day long. Yes he is that perfect to me. He does fucked up shit and it seems kind of crazy but hey I love it. Don't judge me. :) \nI swear within the first couple of pages of this book I my heart was already in it. It is very heart wrenching when reading it at time. Kind of chokes me up still just thinking about this book. I couldn't have asked for a better book to start my year. The author did an amazing job creating such a beautiful fucked up story. Even in authors note got me thinking this will take me on a ride.  ***Author Note: This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone wrong.***  Right there I fucking knew this book would not be leaving me anytime soon and it will stick with me for a long time.

In fact, this nosey bitch did not open a single spoiler because I couldn't wait to cry and have an emotional breakdown of my very own....yeah, I'm weird like that. Unfortunately the only thing I felt was ABSOLUTE annoyance thanks to Lexi's absurd behavior, and you can think I'm being harsh all you like, as even the character called herself pitiful, stupid and pathetic. I found everything about her to be  I-R-R-I-T-A-T-I-N-G! Now onto Twitch I felt nothing for his character. I love me some tats, and his piercing were a definite plus but my vaj requires more than that . I didn't get a single ladyboner while reading. I'm fairly certain that had more to do with Lexi being present than lack of character appeal. Yes, he was cruel, arrogant, mischievous brute but I never disliked him. How could I get upset at Twitch when Lexi so desperately wanted him? Exactly, I couldn't. I kept waiting for Twitch to say \"Come on,it's time to see the wizard. \"........... ... NO KIDDING!  So, once the only thing twitching was my pulsating headache and I had lost all- my- fuck- to -give regarding his vendetta, I knew it was time to say \"I'm done\". So I did.

I was shaking at that ending! After calming myself for 12 hours to decompress, here we go...\n\nDo you like a book that's a little dirty? Ya know, where it's not all hearts and flowers, the sex isn't missionary with soothing music by Sinatra? Where the hero is really an anti-hero who starts out on a mission of revenge and ends up falling for his victim? Yes? Well, then Raw is the book for you!\nAfter reading Willing Captive by Belle Aurora, I knew I had to read this. Her writing style is raw and gritty for sure. It captives the reader immediately, leaving you incapable of putting the book down. So many reviews posted Ms. Aurora's warning at the start of this book- \"This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone bad.\"I don't agree entirely. I think this sets the reader up that love won't occur in this book. It does, so that, in my humble opinion, makes this a love story. A torturous love story. That quote I worry sets it up so people won't take the chance on it. \nI'd rather quote her dedication of this book because it sums it up perfectly to me.\"To anyone who has ever loved unconditionally. To all the people who have loved someone who did not deserve it. And finally, to every person who has followed their heart down the path less travelled. This is for you.\"I devoured this book. When I dove in, I didn't come up for air. It's mysterious and captivating right up to the end. There are still a couple questions not answered in my head though. I'd honestly avoid reading a ton of reviews for this as EVERYONE barks at the lack of a HEA. Well, the ending will leave you shaking, that's for sure. But not official negative closure and the last three sentences of the book leave me with hope for a future book...The feelings I was left with deep inside after reading Raw was mostly rawness. Funny she chose that as the title because it's perfect. Lexi is a social worker who notices this hooded man watching her day after day. He never makes a move, in fact, she almost gets a sense of safety from his gaze. When one day this hooded enigma saves her from a sexual assault, she's even more drawn to his protective persona. Not to mention, when the hood comes down, he's gorgeous- all tattooed, clean smelling, muscular...hot. And his name is Trink....\nThat's all you're getting. Read it. Unless you're a total hearts and flowers romance reader, I do NOT think the ending is that bad. I also wouldn't call this book that dark AT ALL. I look forward to reading Willing Captive after reading this gem!A book that evokes the feelings this one did in me deserves to be hailed! I applaud Belle Aurora. On a comparative sense, I do not think this book's ending was non-HEA like Blind Obsession by Ella Frank. Everyone talked of that non-HEA. This one leaves me with hope...just read the last three sentences! In the mean time, I'll pick up my heart off the floor and trudge on.

Stupid little voice in my head trying to get me killed but I'm so glad I read this book because omg it's brilliant!I usually stick to my happily ever afters, like come on don't we have enough bad shit in real life, why read about sad things huh? But then I have them days where I pick up a book and say break my heart baby..okay I don't really..I don't talk to books..pfft nah that ain't me.. But yeah sometimes you read a book that breaks your heart, turns you into an emotional mess and leaves you thinking about it for Months and years days later and having the whole story flash in your mind and it haunts you all over again.You\u2019re nobody \u2018til somebody loves you.This isn't your normal love story, it won't leave you with bubbles of happiness and rainbows..nah it will crush you, haunt you, stalk you ;)Right from the start the story gripped me and it never let me go.I finished this book all in one day as I couldn't stop reading it, even though at times I was confused, hurt angry and so many other emotions that I can't even name. Addiction:-The condition of being habitually or compulsively occupied with or or involved in something.Synonyms:\tdependency, dependence, craving, habit, weakness, compulsion, fixation, enslavementThis is a story of an addict, of abuse, of hope, of destruction.This is a story of two people being link by hurt, two people desperate to fill the void in their lives.\u201cWe\u2019re all addicted to something that takes away the pain.\u201d The characters are damaged both Lexi and Twitch have had a tough life.Their relationship is dysfunctional, colossal mess of hurt, love,lust, anger and yet there is so much more to it. Twitch..Oh Twitch my heart ached for him, for what he went through. I wanted to reach into the book and give him a big hug and make him feel loved because that's what he needed, what he lived without for too long. But then there were times I wanted to punch him in the face and scream at him for not being open, for not communicating, for being so damn hard to read!!\u201cMonsters don't always lurk in the shadows. Sometimes they hide in plain sight.\u201d Lexi was a strong character, I really liked her even though I sometimes felt like omg why would you let him do that? Twitch became her weakness and in a way he was as much of her addiction as she was his.Being a victim of abuse, that will always stay with you no matter how old you get, no matter what happens. You can either live life thinking about it daily and being bitter about it or you can make something of yourself.You can rise above it.You can change and give someone the hope and help you never got. Lexi fell into the right side where as Twitch fell into the bad..but who are we to put people into boxes? Life is full of choices and this story shows you how your choices bring consequences sometimes good and sometimes bad.Twitch isn't a hero.Twitch needs help. He won't save you if he is here to punish you.First book of 2014 and Oh yes it started with a bang! \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.

I think there were two main issues for me:#1 Alexa\nShe spent most of the book contradicting herself, her inner dialogue saying one thing but she would do the opposite it just got over the top annoying.#2 BDSM or not?I think there is a fine line between a dominant and a cocky asshole who likes to boss women around, at times Twitch came off as the later unfortunately.To be fair in the book he does say he is not a dom. Was that just an excuse by the author for not being able to write one? Whatever it was it did not work for me.I did like that the setting of the story was in my home town, it is not often a story I read is set in Sydney. Darling point is a very nice part of Sydney too.\nThe love/hate I felt while reading this turned to just not liking it at all when I hit about the 60% mark, I was wondering why I was reading this.\nI just got so sick of Twitches inner dialogue, I got it your a bad guy who has done bad shit I got past it you should too.

I'm going soft. I can't believe I'm about to give a middling rating strictly based on some sort of connective emotion for a book which my brain is screaming at me to hate.Honestly, I can't figure it out. The writing was sloppy in places, so many generic terms and nicknames were used, and we even had a TSTL heroine. Any one of these things alone can cause me to 1 star a book, and this time it was as if the \"Stacia hates it\" trifecta was out in full force.Yet, here I am, not hating the book, even if I was hating on the main character. It was as if she didn't even want to try to consider common sense at all. Do I give her bonus points for knowing that she was part of the problem? I don't know.\n\n\"You, my dear, are a stupid ho.\"\n\nTwitch was a horrible person, but he never claimed to be otherwise. I can get down for reading about characters who are who they are and make no apologies for it, even if what they are is nothing above despicable. At least evil isn't always boring. \n\n\"The world needs villains too.\"\n\nWhat else drove my rating down : It always comes back to the heroine not taking enough time to think things through in her head. Look, I get the notion of acting without thinking. Most of us at one time or another have jumped feet first into a relationship or situation without considering the consequences. But after the initial warm fuzzies wear off, common sense starts kicking in. And if it's not kicking in, someone, somewhere is going to let you know at some point along the way that you are making a huge mistake (that's what friends and family love to do - tell you that your choices are shit). Oh wait, the friends in this story were unable to see what was wrong either. Guess it sucks to be you, Lexi.Speaking of the friends - the chapters with Lexi and her friends were boring as hell. Skim, skim, skim.Random complaints : I am not buying that a 6 year old not only knows how to carve a name into a tree, but was able to remember and spell out a long (full) name having only heard it once. My kid is right around this age and yeah...it's not happening.Also, the description of Lexi on coke sounded more like she was doing acid. Just sayin...Why I still kept reading : I wanted to know how this train wreck could possibly turn out. What happens when the stalker with an agenda ends up questioning his own agenda?The story itself had something which kept me interested enough to keep reading. The idea was a good one. I was instantly curious about the guy in a hoodie who was watching Lexi, especially after reading the prologue and knowing right away who he was, even when she didn't have a clue. The build to the reveal at the end had me wondering if there was any way this couple could find a way to make it work, which is a point to the good side. I like to be strung along a little like that. I actually thought the ending was a suitable one. It appears some people didn't like how the story wrapped up, but for me, it was a good stopping point. I honestly hope that this DOES NOT turn into an instance where the fans pressure the author for a book 2. The story can't go to a good place from here without getting tedious or repetitive. It's up to us as the reader to imagine what comes next. And I already decided in my head what has happened, so I don't want to be told otherwise that this isn't the case.Who should read this book? Fans of anti-heroes, sociopaths (wait, are there actual fans of sociopaths?), or taboo mind fuck erotica with an emphasis on unconventional romance.Who should not read this book? All of my fellow picky reader friends. You know who you are. Normally, I'd be on board with all of you in slamming the cliches present here, but I somehow found myself drawn in to the story in spite of the normal annoyance factors.Okay, I'm officially getting off the taboo contemporary book train for a little while. It's been a weird ride this week. I'm ready to go back to the land of something else for the time being."}, {"userName": "Mikee Andrea (ReadWithMikee)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44137919-mikee-andrea-readwithmikee", "userReview": "This book is REALLY messed up.This book really messed ME up.Raw was nowhere near my cup of tea but god was it intriguing.

He\u2019s just\u2026raw. Everything about him is raw. And gritty. And unbound. He\u2019s a raging fire. And I\u2019m a fragile moth fluttering into the flame. Sooner or later, I\u2019m going to get burned. I know this. Will I even survive the heat? How can I trust this man after everything we\u2019ve been through in such a short time?\u201dWell get me on the Belle bandwagon, this is the first book I have read by this author and I LOVED IT!This was a nonstop addictive read. One I relished and read in a calculative way as to not miss any piece of Lexi and Twitch's story. I loved both MC\u2019s as well as the secondary characters. They all had unique, interesting, flawed, loveable, damaged characteristics allowing me to get enough of them to want more. Some I will not soon forget and some I hope to read more about *hint\u2026 to the author.Even though I sort of knew where the story was going, I enjoyed the entire journey and I especially enjoyed the relationship development between Lexi and Twitch as well as the melting of his cold Grinch-like heart.I think the ending was perfectly selfless and was so fitting for Lexi and Twitch. I know many readers are enraged and shocked, but I thought it was primo. It is best to not read any reviews with spoilers. I had no idea how it would end and I liked it that way.Some lasting moments:\u201cI\u2019ve never been with a man who has a piercing before. The bar goes vertically, with one silver ball resting on the sensitive underside, and the other just where the head starts on the top of his shaft. He\u2019s thick. He\u2019s long. He\u2019s smooth. He\u2019s impressive.\u201c\u201cIf you promise to never leave me, I will love you. And be good to you. I\u2019ll treat you like a queen.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like labels. I won\u2019t be defined by words like normal, unbalanced, or damaged. There\u2019s so much more to me than words. I have layers, just like the next person, and if you picked me apart layer-by-layer, you\u2019d find a blackened crust where my heart should be. But ever since Lexi came into my life, a thin bud of greenery sprouted there, giving me hope that even I could be the person who makes someone\u2019s day better.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Elise \u2718 a.k.a Ryder's Pet \u2718", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13567836-elise-a-k-a-ryder-s-pet", "userReview": "[No. (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27276528-elizabeth", "userReview": "[I was completely devestated that Lexi tells Twitch she is pregnant and then he is killed.
