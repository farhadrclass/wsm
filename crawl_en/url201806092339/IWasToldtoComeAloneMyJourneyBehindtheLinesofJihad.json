It was fascinating, but a thinker. Several times I had to put this down and get a little distance because the topics hit so close to home. As someone who has tried to gain a full understanding of the Muslim faith, this account sharply highlights the struggles that modern Islam faces in the modern world. More than anything, this book is fair. It truly delves deeply into all sides of every argument. Mekhennet searches for truth above all else, and shows readers the slivers of truth she has found thus far, allowing them to put the puzzle pieces together themselves and form their own opinions."}, {"userName": "Murtaza ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza", "userReview": "The type of writing that exists about jihadism in the West generally ranges from nauseating action-movie style jingoism to purely utilitarian analyses written for intelligence officials and policymakers. The reported pieces that exist tend to focus on one or two specific episodes, often in a purely correspondent manner, and if there is any meaningful big picture view of the conflict at all it is just tacked on in a few pages at the end. Most irritatingly these books almost invariably fail at the basic task of portraying all sides in the conflict as human beings; instead reducing the world to a battle between some well-developed \"good guys\" and a group of swarthy, sinister terrorists whose lives are ultimately a mystery.This book is very different. Mostly, I suspect, because its author is not one of the usual white Westerners writing about the War on Terror. Souad Mekhennet had a working-class upbringing as the daughter of Muslim immigrants in Germany, before growing up to become one of the few Muslim journalists in the West writing about jihadism. This book is her memoir and traces back over much of the reporting she has done in her life, as well as her own background growing up as a traditional, culturally-rooted Muslim in Europe, a continent where many people consider people of her religion to be either irritants or threats. I found her personal story moving in part because I'm a journalist who writes about many of the same themes, but also because I know she is speaking for the experience of many people whose voices are never heard in the media.The book starts with Mekhennet's early life in Germany and Morocco, tracing her experiences being raised in Europe and how she came to be involved in journalism as a young woman. It then moves to cover her reporting on the Iraq War, global jihadism and the aftermath of the Arab Spring. Her work really makes her a witness to history, placing her at the center of some of the biggest national security stories of the past few decades. Unlike many other reporters (and largely because of her background) she is deeply sourced among Islamists both in Europe and the Arab World, and even in Pakistan. Her sourcing allows her to get close to these people and give a holistic picture of who they are. In both good and bad ways she is able to humanize them and to provide a genuine picture of how they see the world and what motivates them. Many of the jihadists she knows show her a level of warmth that they undoubtedly would never show to a white Western man who had come to report on their movements; interlocutors that they would be far more likely to consider as either hostile or dishonest. Some of the jihadists Mekhennet interviews are driven by ideological fanaticism, while others are driven by moral anguish over instances of torture, oppression and general mistreatment. Oftentimes it is a mixture of both. But everyone is complicated, including the Iraqis whose children are killed by U.S. soldiers during the war and the 9/11 victims she meets who complain that the media had never informed them that so much anger had been building against their country in the Middle East.There are no polemics in this book. To the contrary, there is a remarkable amount of humanity and a rare level of fairmindedness afforded to the experiences of both Easterners and Westerners. Given Mekhennet's experience of life straddling two worlds, she is able to depict both sides in the War on Terror as something beyond the one-dimensional caricatures that usually prevail. She is brave and honest in speaking about the reasons for radicalization, openly wondering whether the anger she felt as a teenager suffering racism in Germany would have made her vulnerable to the terrorist recruiters that exist today, a haunting thought that I believe many Western Muslims in their 30s and 40s share. In one very poignant passage, Mekhennet meets with a Belgium-raised Islamic State commander on the Turkish border, telling him that he \"took the easy path out\" in response to the fear and alienation that she also grew up with in Europe. He seems to get what she means, like a lot of people do.The reporting in the book is thrilling, but what truly makes it great is the writer herself, who you come to respect for her intelligence and bravery but also for the aspects of her own story that she shares. Throughout all of the reporting, Mekhennet interweaves her personal life: her fears, anxieties and hopes for her future, amid the challenges of being a woman and a minority doing this type of work. Even as a successful journalist in the West she still hasn't escaped the suspicion of colleagues or intelligence agencies and the frustration and fear that this causes. You really get an understanding of where she is coming from, and I would argue that her personal story is an important part of the broader geopolitical phenomenon that she reports on. This was a tour de force of a memoir, and certainly one of my favorite books on jihadism in recent years. It's one that I wish that all Westerners, and Americans in particular, would take the time to read."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/305395-maggie", "userReview": "ScrappyMags.com one of my best of 2017!!!Scrappymags 3-word review: Alarming. Entrancing. Disturbing.Genre: Non-fiction/MemoirShortest summary ever: Our author Souad Mekhennet is a reknowned German journalist who has written for many top publications like the NYTimes and Washington Post. Her many interviews with Jihadists and insiders in ISIS and Al Queda is astounding. She grills them, asking important questions, trying to remain unbiased, veering to that key question, \u201cWhy do they hate us so much?\u201dWhat\u2019s good under the hood: This should be required reading. Everything is good. I was visibly tensing despite knowing she is safe (duh she\u2019s written this book). My anxiety level was at an 8, nearly too high for me to settle down to read, yet I flipped through pages like a Tom Clancy novel. Written with candor and class, Mekhennet\u2019s story captures her Muslim upbringing, which I appreciated, because as much as journalists (and myself as a teacher) try to stay unbiased, we have them and Mekhennet made clear statements about how difficult this was for her. Her own memoir as a Muslim youth was notable, where often she was ostracized in German society. In that respect, she could understand some of the anger jihadists grew living (and born in) Western nations feeling unwelcomed, but her upbringing (with strong parents and the beauty of Islam) turned her one way, while jihadists turned another. The book then focuses on her travels while reporting, the many faces of both sides of the story from those in the government to those in the middle of the desert \u2013 hiding. Straight up jihadists. I remember a professor telling me in college, \u201cOne person\u2019s terrorist is another\u2019s freedom fighter\u201d and Mekhennet touches on this, staying in the middle yet challenging both sides with issues of torture, lack of due process, and questioning the logic of jihadist views that oppose mainstream Islam along with their depolorable actions. Her experience shows a balance of both sides, yet make it clear \u2013 she does NOT support terrorism in any shape or form, but the book vividly shows WHY these jihadists came to be. The remaining question is \u2013 how do we deal with this on a global scale? Watch for the lines of Mekhennet\u2019s marriage proposals/wooing by jihadists and government officials. It adds just a touch of laughter in an otherwise serious and intelligently laudable narrative.What\u2019s bad or made me mad: The surprising part, nothing was the author\u2019s fault that made me mad, it was merely the truth that angered me. Mad at Western governments for not caring about Muslim people and mad at jihadists for spreading terror and hate. In that respect, it\u2019s a thinking book, and it will pull at your mind long after the final page. Recommend to:Everyone. Most appropriate for those age 16 and up as it does mention jihadist beheadings. I used to teach AP Human Geography and this would be a fantastic book to read for that class or many Poli Sci classes (Politics and Revolution). Anyone looking to answer the question \u201cwhy do they hate us?\u201d It certainly opens that question to consideration and understanding.Read with an open mind and always try to place yourself in the life of the \u201cother\u201d person. My remaining questions are how to reach these youth who turn to radicalism and not a more positive path and how do we hold all accountable for atrocities, both jihadists and those who commit crimes under the guise of \u201cgovernment\u201d. Those thoughts haunt me\u2026Sincere \u201cshukraan\u201d to NetGalley, Henry Holt and Co. and the Ms. Mekhennet for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review and for making me consider, think, ponder, wonder and feel."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40997852-nicole", "userReview": "Wow, this was a remarkable book. Souad Mekhennet is a woman to admire. She's journalist of a Morrocan descendant, who lived most of her life in Germany. She wrote for some of the most popular paper like the NYT and the Washington's Post, met some of the most wanted Jihadists risking her life meanwhile. Souad pushed the limits and went to interview Jihadists trying meanwhile to change not only the West's views about Islam but also Jihadists' views about the West. Islam isn't terror just like not all the westerns are their politicians. \"Why do they hate us so much?\" is the question that kept her going to go where no ever went, write about her beliefs, and made her who she is right now. I listened to the audiobook and it was well narrated. Highly recommend this book if you're looking for a non-fiction about Jihad told from personal experience of a Journalist with mixed beliefs. She isn't afraid to tell what was truly happening in the world without being biased to any side."}, {"userName": "Lauren ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren", "userReview": "While reading this book, I stumbled upon a silly headline discussing a Twitter mention of a singer/songwriter as a \"bad bitch\", and then Twitter's overwhelming response to this comment with hundreds (thousands now, no doubt) of stories of brave and strong women in history who did remarkable (and often dangerous) things. ...and it occurred to me that Souad Mekhennet should be on this list. Reading this book, hearing her drive for the truth, for representation - she is a brave and strong woman whose story is important and should be read. Mekhennet's memoir/essay/investigative reporting drew me in from the first page. She opens the book meeting with an ISIS lieutenant in Turkey in 2014. From there, she traces the steps leading up to this meeting: her own path to this point, and the Muslim world's path to extremism and the formation of ISIS. Her unique childhood in Germany and Morocco, her early interest in journalism (she put a film poster of All the President's Men on her bedroom wall in the way any other girl would post a boyband or a unicorn), and her aptitude for languages, writing, and cultural understanding and dialogue are all on display in each chapter. The structure of the book is based on Mekhennet's postings and journalistic assignments throughout Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan working for various German media outlets, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. She is regularly threatened with abduction, rape, torture, and death, yet is also welcomed as a guest into the homes of extremists in Al Qaeda and its syndicates, the Taliban, and ISIS for frank interviews and discussions. She cultivates quality sources, arranges clandestine meetings, and is tailed by intelligence services. She is a strong and educated Muslim woman, and many - even in these fundamentalist circles - seem to respect her for that.It was her work in London investigating the identity of the British ISIS member \"Jihadi John\" that lead her to biggest break yet. Along with a handful of colleagues at the Washington Post, she uncovered this Kuwati-born British man's name, history, and his path to radicalization. You can read the entire chapter from the book on Longreads here: https://longreads.com/2017/08/16/how-a-journalist-uncovered-the-true-identity-of-jihadi-john/.A phenomenal book that never lost momentum, and only increased my admiration for the work of journalists and truthseekers. Highly recommended.Related: another brave journalist doing amazing work and writing her memoirs is Lynsey Addario. These books would be great read together."}, {"userName": "Maree", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5001811-maree", "userReview": "This is definitely a book I feel like all Americans should read in this day and age. Other people too, of course, but I think it makes a couple great points that Americans are often light on, coming from an outside/inside perspective, and detailing a lot of the background on the Middle East that many (including myself) are fuzzy on.The background on how we got to this point, following Mekhennet's journey as a reporter, is just fascinatingly well-told and fairly easy to follow. From her perspective, you can see a lot of the warning signs and understand why the US wasn't greeted with thrown rose petals in the streets, as our VP at the time had said would happen. There's no judgement passed, just truth in reporting. You can see the unrest, the changes that took place after dictators were felled. I was particularly surprised to note that under many of the dictators, women tended to be a lot more free; the rights of minorities were protected a fair amount under many of them. It wasn't until the more extreme majority religious groups took over that women had to start wearing the full religious coverings and stopped being able to hold offices, etc. There was a lot of movement backwards in terms of equality when these dictators (who, granted, killed people who opposed them and were corrupt in many other ways) were toppled, and the stability that those countries had seen under them vanished into a new system of confusion.Just makes me think of the prime directive to not interfere in other cultures that you do not understand.In addition to learning about the backgrounds of many of the current situations we find ourselves in with Middle East countries, there were a couple quotes that I picked out that really spoke to me, mostly about the perspective of the media and public reaction to reporting:\"Could this kind of impartial journalism about jihadists and the War on Terror be safely practiced in the West only by someone whose parents had been born and raised there, rather than someone whose Muslim descent made her and object of special interest and suspicion? ...These were dark thoughts that made me question the foundations and ultimate success of the West's supposed openness to outsiders and its commitment to freedom of speech and thought.\" p155Mekhennet clearly shows that her Muslim descent was an advantage in her reporting. She was able to get interviews others were not because of her understanding of religion and because of her background. But it's also not a bad thing to look at reporting and examine it with a critical eye, as she says herself in regard to citizen journalism:\"'Citizen journalism' seemed to be the new big thing, but I worried about what such activist reporting would do to what we call the 'truth.' If readers and viewers got used to a kind of journalism that told them only one side of the story, how would their views of the world change?\" p226I realize that reporting for the Washington Post and NYT is not the same, but I think it's fair to think about the motives of reporters, especially in this day and age. At the same time, it's obviously ridiculous to group all Muslims in with terrorists, which some famous people we won't mention have done many times. Overall, be thoughtful in your readings. Don't make assumptions, but don't be blind, either. This book can help a lot of people better understand where we are now and how we got there, and ideally would help prevent us from making the same mistakes in the future. Though I'm not sure how often we actually learn from history. :-/"}, {"userName": "Fran Soto", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65760858-fran-soto", "userReview": "I won this book on Goodreads.

I thought I was reasonably knowledgeable until I read Mekhennet's book, which really drove home the fact that these tensions and conflicts with the Muslim world are not new, did not start with 9/11, and are equally as\u2014if not more\u2014prominent in European counties such as France, Germany, and Britain than the U.S. Mekhennet did a great job of describing the divide within Muslims themselves, between Shia and Sunni and those who support currently jihad-associated actions (think violence, oppression of women) and those who believe that the way jihad is currently used by violent factions is very much not in accordance with the laws of Islam and teachings of Muhammed. She also has made amazing contacts with the underground jihadists/ISIS, partially due to her being a Muslim and partially because she has a desire to find and tell the truth coupled with the ability to stay calm in extremely dangerous situations.I learned a lot from this book, and while her storytelling was engaging, it was less informative that I was hoping. It is not an explanation of Middle Eastern politics, but was instead a chronological account of her experiences focusing on discrete events/interviews.There were a few things I did not like about it as well. Mekhennet's tone was sometimes....too self-aggrandizing? Too poor me due to discrimination based on her race (not that I am saying the discrimination wasn't real or that it is downright illegal, she was just super fixated on it at times, which struct a wrong note given the context of the rest of the book)? I can't really put my finger on it, but it was just odd at times.But, my biggest complaint is the narrator of this book. It is an American narrator which is not Mekhennet's voice at all. She is German, with German and Arabic as her first languages, followed by French then English as an adult. While she has worked for the NY Times and WaPo, she spends little time in the States but is based in Europe, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. She speaks excellent English, but her accent is affected by her geographic roots. She also is not telling the story of Americans, she is telling the story of non-American Muslims. The narrators voice should have reflected that and shame on the audiobook producer for American-washing the story and the voice.Overall, this was a great book. I learned a lot, including learning that I know very little about the complicated religious, historical, and geopolitical climate of the Middle East! I need a history of this for dummies...."}, {"userName": "Raghu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu", "userReview": "This book is unique in many ways. It is even difficult to classify it. It is part autobiography, part memoir, part sociology that mediates between two cultures which are at odds with each other today, and a substantive contribution to some of the highest quality investigation and reporting from behind the inaccessible Jihadi frontlines in the Middle East. I found it a thrilling read, wanting to put it down only reluctantly when something more important needed my attention. Author Souad Mekhennet is a German born Muslim, whose mother is Turkish Shia and father, a Moroccan Sunni. She has been a Washington Post and New York Times correspondent on contract at different times and speaks Arabic, German, French and English. The insights and perspectives in this book are a timely contribution in today\u2019s highly polarized atmosphere in many communities in Western countries, in the middle-east, in North Africa and in South Asia. The book\u2019s main theme comes from trying to answer the question that has been posed for many years now - the question of \u2018Why do They hate us so much?\u2019. Unlike most other journalists and experts, Mekhennet realizes that she cannot find an answer unless she takes the big risks of journeying deep inside the hotbeds of Islamic extremism in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Algeria, Egypt and Pakistan. Interestingly, the more she journeys to the middle east, the more she realizes that she needs to come back to the German, French and Belgian neighbourhoods in Hamburg, Paris and Molenbeek to understand the complete picture. She disregards personal safety to reach out to individuals in the inner circles of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, ISIS and their affiliates in order to get their side of the story. She uses her assets of being a Muslim, an Arabic speaker and her Moroccan ethnicity to gain permissions for the elusive interviews which are denied to journalists of non-Muslim origin. Oddly, her being a woman helps as well with some extremists wanting to even take her as a \u2018second wife\u2019! More seriously, it is her passionate commitment not to take sides in this war on terror and her compassion towards all victims in this \u2018war\u2019, whether Western or Muslim civilians, whether Sunni or Shia or Arab or Persian, that opens so many doors for her in the hearts and minds of the jihadis. As a result, we get a book that is deep in its exploration into the problems relating to \u2018why they hate us so much?\u2019. Her interviews are mainly with Sunni extremists and not with major Shia groups like Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen or others supported by Iran. Hence, the question \u2018why they hate us?\u2019 is basically answered by \u2018why the Sunni extremists hate us?\u2019.After reading the book, I would say that the main catalysts for the intense anger that Sunni Islamists around the world feel towards the West are as follows:1. The way the Western countries deal with Islam and Islamic nations, particularly Palestine, which is seen as exhibiting blatant double standards. 2. The West\u2019s military actions in the Middle-east which have emasculated Sunnis and helped the Shiites to emerge as the dominant power in the Gulf, causing serious dislocation of millions of Sunnis, rape of their women, torture, kidnappings and destruction of their economic well-being 3. Incarceration, physical torture and livelihood destruction of innocent Muslims on suspicion of being terrorists in many Western countries4. Acute alienation among European Sunni Muslims due to joblessness, poverty, broken homes and ghettoisation. 5. Incessant wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and now Syria, not to mention drone strikes in Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan killing large numbers of civilians.The Sunni extremists see the the United States, the US-backed Iraqi Shias, Iran and any nation where Islam is threatened as their principal enemies. Senior Sunni leaders like Shaker-al-Abssi of the Al-Qaeda tell the author in 2006 itself that only an islamic Caliphate can protect Muslim interests in the world. So, establishing a Caliphate will have to precede the liberation of Palestine and other nations. This shows that the idea of a Caliphate long predates the emergence of ISIS. Abssi and others believe that they have a right to hit the US in its home because the US hits hard in their homes. On the face of it, it looks as though these are mostly already known facts and that Mekhennet need not have taken such immense risks to end up saying things which are known already. But the book\u2019s purpose is more than that. Most of us in the world form an opinion in this matter by reading only one side of the picture in this conflict, which is that of the affluent West. The author\u2019s efforts help to humanize and present the view from the the other side as well - the Muslim side. On the Arab Springs, the author says that it only confirmed that the majority in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya or Syria want an Islamic way of life and rule rather than western-style democracy, contrary to what our media would like us to believe.Souad Mekhennet makes some incisive arguments on the question of \u2018where freedom of speech ends and hate speech begins\u2019. She takes an explosive, contemporary example to discuss this question. There has been intense controversy regarding the offensive cartoons on the Prophet Mohammed in the Danish newspaper \u2018Jyllands-Posten\u2019 in 2005 which were later reprinted in the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo. What we all remember are the violent protests in various countries in the middle-east with radical groups calling for the killing of the cartoonists and Islamic nations boycotting Danish products. We saw endless discussions on TV in the West, with politicians and journalists talking about freedom of speech and about Muslims being incapable of living in a democracy. Author Mekhennet says that the truth is a bit more nuanced than this. She goes to Denmark to research the story along with co-authors of an earlier book of hers. She learns that before the Prophet Mohammed cartoons were published, Jyllands-Posten had refused to print cartoons depicting Jesus in a derogatory manner because they believed that those drawings would hurt its readers\u2019 feelings! Prior to all the violence, Muslim groups had also sued Charlie Hebdo for insulting Islam and inciting racial hatred, but their claims were dismissed. Mekhennet says that she had met earlier a number of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust in the US, They had told her that the Charlie Hebdo cartoons reminded them of how the Nazis insulted Jews and Judaism in the 1930s. She makes these arguments in a well-known German TV talk-show. In return, she receives some kudos from some people but there were many who abused her on Twitter and threatened her with death and calling her \u2018enemy of the German race\u2019. She had to hide her home address for fear of her family being harmed. The author\u2019s point is that it has been an issue of \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 only when Islam was targeted.The book reveals certain disturbing truths about the Moroccan immigrant Muslim families in Molenbeek, Belgium, which only a person of Moroccan origin like her can perceive. The alienation of Muslim families in Molenbeek has been well documented by many. Mekhennet says that most Muslim parents in the area do not understand their children nor care much about how they are doing in school. The kids do not know if they are Belgian, French or Moroccan and the parents do not care if their children integrated. These kids are born in Europe but they see their parents invest all their money in trying to build a reputation back home in Morocco. The kids and their families live on a pittance most of the year in Belgium only to see their parents lavishing gifts on their friends and relatives back in their native countries. They see their parents caring mainly about making money and building businesses and, especially about becoming somebody in the eyes of people back home. It is all about showing Moroccans back home how they have made it in Europe. It is no coincidence that large numbers of Western jihadists have come from troubled or broken homes, where poverty, joblessness and upheaval are the norm. Young Muslims and Muslim converts in Europe seem to have a fascination for the Caliphate as a place where Islam prevails and a sense of community exists. However, the author is quick to balance this statement with its counter that poverty, joblessness and alienation are not justification to choose ISIS as the solution.I must say that I didn\u2019t come away with much hope for the future of relations between the Islamic and non-Islamic world after reading the book. We read that in Nahr-al-Bared camp in Lebanon, a father, who is a militant, praises his teenage son for killing an infidel in a video game and eggs him on to continue doing so. In Zaqar, a mother shows a violent video of Shia atrocities on Sunnies in Iraq to her four small children. When Mekhennet questions her on this, she says that it is necessary conditioning for their future. In Amman, the author reports hostility in the eyes of onlookers just because her colleague, an American, walks with her, an Arab woman in \u2018abaya\u2019. All along, whether in Hamburg or Molenbeek or Lebanon or Egypt, there is the ever-present chasm between Muslim and non-Muslim, Westerner and Arab, Shia and Sunni. There are some balancing, hopeful accounts as well but they are only in the past. For example, Mekhennet meets with Armenian Christians in Iraq who tell her that they lived a secure and happy life under Saddam Hussein and that they could worship freely. They tell her that the Ba\u2019ath party was secular and kept religion away from politics. The Armenian pastor even tells her that it is wrong to say that the Shia was deprived of rights completely in Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq. The epilogue in the book poignantly recounts the death of a fourteen-year-old boy, son of the author\u2019s cousin, in a terror strike in Munich in 2016. The narrative brings graphically the pain that a family undergoes on the death of its loved one in a terror attack. The author says tellingly, \u201ca mother's screams over the body of her murdered child sound the same, no matter if she is black, brown or white; Muslim, Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. We are all buried in the same ground.\u201dA powerful and courageous book, straddling cultures and seeking truth."}, {"userName": "Caidyn (BW Book Reviews; he/him/his)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-bw-book-reviews-he-him-his", "userReview": "This review and others can be found on BW Book Reviews.I heard about this book earlier this year thanks to the New York Times' The Interpreter newsletter. I was sitting at work and saw that I had gotten an email from them. Since I'm now an avid news reader, with the NYT as my favorite, I started reading it when I got a chance to sit down for a bit. Their interview was with the author, who talked some about her book and experiences. Me being me, I immediately went to my library's website and placed a hold on the downloadable audiobook.Boy was this good. I think it takes the cake as one of my favorite\u00a0non-fiction books this year. It begins with her explaining about her life, her beginnings in Germany and Morocco, then through school and into her early work. It covers the course of her life so far and it is an impelling listen/read. Honestly, I didn't want to stop listening to it because her story was so interesting. More importantly, I was shocked that I had never heard of Souad. A Muslim woman born and raised in Europe, who now writes and has contacts in various jihadi groups? And who also played a huge role in uncovering Jihadi John and explaining to the rest of the (white) world why we're hated? I mean, this is legendary.Without giving away anything, because I definitely think that it's best to read this instead of read about someone's take about this interesting book, I think my favorite part was seeing all of the parallels between her life and the current people fighting for Islam. European born and raised, second-generation, sees the double standard all around them about whether they're European or Middle Eastern, the anger that brings. Radically different reactions to it, but I feel that's why she was able to slip in so easily into the world and end up with so many contacts who actually cared about her despite different ideologies.I highly recommend this book to anyone.

Souad is a German-born journalist of Turkish-Moroccan descent, who has covered global jihad around the world for esteemed dailies like the New York Times and the Washington Post. 'I was Told to Come Alone' is the story of Souad's upbringing in Germany and Morocco and her increased engagement with the Salafist jihad as an investigative journalist. She traveled to conflict zones as far as Iraq, Jordan, Algeria, and Pakistan and interviewed key Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Taliban leaders, sometimes bringing the ire of both the authorities and militants. Souad is an incredibly courageous and resilient woman who doggedly overcame barriers to the rise of a Muslim woman reporter in a world beset with violence, discrimination, and harassment. This book reads like a thriller and introduces the reader to the art of investigative journalism with all its perils. Souad\u2019s story on the identity of Jihadi John, in particular, is a paean to quality journalism. Her experiences are by turns funny, chilling, and heart-rending. At times, one is moved to tears, especially through the last pages of the book. The central question this book poses is, \"Why do they hate us so much?\" Mekhennet seeks to answer this question by piecing together different narratives underpinning Islamic terrorism. She argues that the involvement of Europe-born Muslims in religious terrorism could be understood in the wider context of social exclusion and discrimination Muslims face in the West as well as West\u2019s ill-advised campaigns in the Muslim world, creating fissures and allowing authoritarian regimes to exclude more people from the political process. It is here that one should have a few problems with Souad Mekhennet's analysis. Granted that poverty and disenfranchisement drive the Muslim youth into religious extremism, this is, however, not a sufficient explanation to unpack the complex phenomenon of global jihad, and tends to ignore Salafism as an ideology with its historical roots and linkages to classical Islam, including some of the injunctions in the primary sources. Similarly, in her analysis Mekhennet does not lay enough emphasis on the need for reform in Islam and considers by default that Islam quintessentially is a religion of peace and that the actions of terrorists have nothing to do with the early and pristine form of the faith. It is only towards the end that she very briefly calls for a reform process in Islam. Despite these omissions, 'I Was Told to Come Alone' is an impressive work and demonstrates the courage of an Arab Muslim woman in the face of multiple obstacles. Every person believing in the agency of women must read this book."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2750601-laura", "userReview": "Souad Mekhennet is of Moroccan descent and German birth.

Auch der Name des in Saint Denis erschossenen Pariser Attent\u00e4ters war ihr vor der Polizei bekannt\u2026Nur wenn du alleine kommst stammt aus der Feder von Souad Mekhennet.Das Buch beginnt mit einem packenden Prolog, bei dem die t\u00fcrkisch-marokkanisch und in Deutschland aufgewachsene Journalistin Souad Mekhennet sich mit einem IS-Mitglied trifft. Das Treffen konnte nur unter der Bedingung stattfinden, das sie alleine kommt, keine Ausweispapiere oder andere Dokumente bei sich f\u00fchrt, ein Handy oder ein Aufnahmeger\u00e4t war auch untersagt, sogar die Handtasche musste sie zur\u00fccklassen, einzig ein Stift und ein Notizblock waren erlaubt. Den Mut aufzubringen zu diesem Treffen, aber auch zu vielen anderen Interviews zu fahren ist bewundernswert.Die Autorin erz\u00e4hlt in diesem Buch nicht nur von ihren Interviews und Recherchen, sondern auch von ihrer Kindheit in Marokko und Deutschland. Schon in ihrer Kindheit erlebte sie Rassismus, aber auch viele Deutsche die ihr hilfreich zur Seite standen. Ihren Entschluss Journalistin zu werden verfolgte sie seit ihrer Jugend hartn\u00e4ckig und zielstrebig. Als Journalistin war sie sowohl f\u00fcrs Fernsehen, wie auch als freie Journalistin f\u00fcr die New York Times oder die Washington Post t\u00e4tig, und baute sich dabei eine breites Netzwerk mit Kontaktpersonen auf, sowohl in den Medien als auch bei den verschiedenen Terrororganisationen.In all ihren Berichten versucht sie objektiv zu bleiben und den Dingen dabei wirklich auf den Grund zu gehen und sie zu verstehen. Dabei gibt sie auch Islamisten eine Stimme und versucht auch aufzuzeigen was zu ihrer Radikalisierung gef\u00fchrt hat, ohne ihre Taten oder Gedankeng\u00e4nge dabei Gutzuhei\u00dfen. Sie zeigt auch die Fehler der westlichen Welt auf, die mit ihrer Einstellung und Berichterstattung, ihrem Rassismus und Handlungen dazu beitragen, das sich Menschen radikalisieren und sich der Hass auf die westliche Welt im arabischen und nordafrikanischen Raum weiter ausbreitet. Auch versucht sie aufzuzeigen, das trotz gleicher Begrifflichkeit, Demokratie im Westen anders verstanden wird als zum Beispiel im arabischen Raum.Sie beleuchtet auch den massiven Konflikt zwischen Sunniten und Schiiten untereinander, die sich seit Jahrhunderte bek\u00e4mpfen und sich mit einem Hass verfolgen, der mir in dem Ausma\u00df nicht bewusst war.F\u00fcr mich ist dieses Buch ein beeindruckendes Werk, das sich oftmals so spannend liest wie ein Krimi oder Thriller, und mein Wissen \u00fcber den Dschihad, die Radikalisierung von Menschen, ihr Gedankengut, den Konflikt innerhalb des Islams, der Arbeit von Journalisten und der westlichen Medien und auch die T\u00e4tigkeiten von Geheimdiensten damit mehrte.Mein Fazit:Ein beeindruckendes Buch, das sich spannend wie ein Krimi liest und dabei Wissen \u00fcber ein sehr komplexes Thema vermittelt."}, {"userName": "Shreya Shreya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31773772-shreya-shreya", "userReview": "MOROCCO/GERMANYSouad Mekhennet is a bad-ass role model every girl/boy/man/woman should know about.

As a Muslim but a blond one, and coming from Bosnia where the lack of Western intervention apparently inspired many jihadis to action, this book left me questioning my own identity. I think I finally realized that jihadis ultimately don't think they are doing anything wrong. I know it's so simple to say it, but Souad's ability to get into their hearts and minds is what really painted their own feelings about the world. In the end, you'll feel awed.

Her tenacity and resolve to follow the story where it leads rather than map the narrative and then supply the evidence she prefers illustrates why the world continues to need trained and dedicated journalists. Mekhennet\u2019s deep knowledge, both experiential and academic, as well as her insistence on treating all sources and ideas fairly (and challenging them all, too!) allows her to operate in an almost hallowed space - able to access high level jihadi contacts while reporting for several of the world\u2019s most influential Western publications. Mekhennet's ability to encourage sources and relentless campaign against taking the path of least resistance are not the only aspects of her work that makes it so compelling; I would be remiss not to point out her ninja word skills. Some sections are crafted with tension of an action thriller - I dare you to try putting the book down as she lights up the trail to identify that infamous British terrorist known as Jihadi John - and other portions stand out for their poignancy. Her ability to recognize the deep grief at the core of many of her sources without falling into sentimentality is a wonder, and her tendency to obliquely challenge the reader to recognize the shared humanity of so many deeply different people, bounds and rebounds across the book's pages, gaining strength as it goes. When she comes to you in the end with the suggestion that it's not religion or politics that divide us so deeply, but rather that the great struggle of our time is between those who build bridges and those who will not, there's only the tiniest of clangs as the entire conversation she's shared is suddenly reframed and refocused - a warm little slap on the cheek rather than a chilled blow to the side of the head - because Mekhennet has set herself -and by extension, you, the reader - up so very well. Anyone interested in \u201cwhy they hate us\u201d, whatever \u201cthey\u201d you wonder about, look here. Anyone who wants to start to try and understand the landscape of 21st century geopolitics and religion, begin with this - the water is warm, the reading is easy, and the revelations are plentiful. There are nuanced, honest, and important answers to be found and a barrage of insights illuminated. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t know this book existed until the other day.

I was not to carry any identification and would have to leave my cell phone, audio recorder, watch, and purse at my hotel in Antakya, Turkey.\" These were the conditions under which Souad Mekhennet, an investigative journalist at the time for the Washington Post, met with Abu Yusak, the ISIS leader who oversaw the ISIS hostage program, in 2014. Thus begins the fascinating journey of Ms. Mekhennet's story of investigative journalism in the world of Islamic militants across Eurpose and the Middle East.Souad Mekhennet is a Muslim woman of Moroccan and Turkish descent, born and raised in Germany. She was born in 1978 in Frankfurt and has two older sisters, one of whom suffers from brain damage. She attended a prestigious German journalism school, Henri-Nannen School in Hamburg. \"I was one of the youngest students they ever admitted, and the first child of Muslim guest workers.\"Mekhennet was deeply affected by the reporting of Woodward and Bernstein and slowly evolved into a highly skilled investigative reporter for the New York Times and then the Washington Post, as well as various German outlets. She became absorbed with journalism's obligation to take the world inside the minds of Islamic militants after 9/11 and specifically after having had dinner with Maureen Fanning, whose husband was a firefighter who died at the World Trade Center. At that dinner, Fanning struck a chord when she said \"'Nobody told us there were people out there who hated us so much...Why didn't we know this? Politicians didn't tell us. You're journalists, but you never told us.'\" \"She was questioning whether we were doing our jobs, and I found her criticism legitimate.\" Mekhennet wondered, \"Why aren't we doing a better job of telling people like Maureen Fanning what the jihadis think of them?\" This interaction has driven Mekhennet throughout her career.In the memoir Mekhennet describes meeting with Muslim militants throughout the world, including in Iraq, Germany, Algeria, Lebanon, Pakistan, Egypt, France, England and Syria. She relays a harrowing experience about being arrested in Egypt. Each story and each exchange with a terrorist and the related politics is gripping and keeps the reader on the edge of her seat. She even relays a personal story about family members lost to terrorism. The journalistic experiences she describes begin when she is 19 years of age (1997) and ends with her experiences through 2016.Equally as interesting as the travels and meetings are Mekhennet's introspectiive observations about being Muslim, as well as her interactions with Muslims, the terrorists and nonMuslims. Mekhennet thinks back at various times to discrimination which she experienced and the resultant fear and isolation she felt as a Muslim in a nonMuslim country. \"I sometimes wonder what would have happened if an Islamic State recruiter had found me in those dark moments.\" At various times she is believed to be a spy, she is used as an unknowing pawn by intelligence agencies and she is suspected of being a jihadi sympathizer. Throughout she maintains her professionalism as a journalist, but periodically questions the openness and bigotry of western society.The memoir concludes with some thoughts about culture, tolerance and acceptance, ultimately acknowledging that in the end we are all the same. \"If I've learned anything, it's this: a mother's screams over the body of her murdered child sound the same if she is black, brown, or white; Muslim, Jewish or Christian; Shia or Sunni....We will all be buried in the same ground.\"The books is must read. if you like this review subscribe to www.frombriefstobooks.com and read more!"}, {"userName": "Ira", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8772386-ira", "userReview": "A MUST READ!The author has an incredible perspective as a German raised Muslim of Morrocan descent, non-American journalist. While she talks a bit about her upbringing, that is more necessary to provide context of her perspective as well as the tools she is able to bring to bear to get access to the Jihad movement both in the Middle East and in the hotbeds of Europe. Early on, an American who lost a family member to a terrorist attack asks \"why do they hate us (Americans/westerners) so much,\" and that question haunts and drives the author to try and uncover and tell stories. And what stories she tells. I suspect many of the stories -- given some are behind the scenes stories of her prominent articles -- can be read in different form elsewhere, but this is an unbelieveable collection of a dedicated journalist putting her life on the line and effectively being the Forrest Gump of jihad, always interviewing important people in recent history, from the Iraq invasion thru the immigration wave causing massive issues in Europe. . She goes to great efforts to be fair to both the terrorists and the victims; but let's be clear, she is sympathetic towards people, not towards terrorism or radicalism. I was generally aware of the Shia-Sunni divide, especially at the macro-political level, but the author brought it down to an individual level and described how it is being promulgated and weaponized at the micro-grassroots level. Frankly, this book left me both overwhelmed with admiration for the work the author and her co-workers on any given story did (she was very generous with her praise of fellow journalists) and shattered because I just don't see any solutions or end to the cycle of violence...and the pressure cooker and poor Petri dishes that give rise to radicalism are growing/worsening, not going away. And closing \"our doors\" seems at once kinda, sorta sensible but also likely both to make matters worse and to disregard the vast majority of non-radicals. And picking a side (Shia or Sunni) as we seem to repeatedly do seems like it will just make matters worse and make both sides hate us sooner or later. Ugh!But don't let my depressed meanderings suggest this is a political book. The author doesn't attempt to answer big questions or advise on big policy issues. She focuses on people and reporting individual stories and their place within the landscape of Jihad, whether as participants or victims.

She has a unique background having grown up in Morocco and Germany and speaking first Arabic, followed closely by German, and later French then English. Mekhennet is also Muslim herself and is a descendant of Mohammad by way of both her parents. Mekhennet's background gives her unique access to people and places around the world that European, non-Muslim, and non-Arabic speakers simply cannot go.Mekhennet's work made me understand what true journalism looks like. It is reporting on facts while giving the context the reader needs to understand those facts. Mekhennet relates a story about a widow asking why no one ever told the people of America that they are so hated and she frequently refers back to it as a motivation for sharing truth. People need to know the diverse narratives that exist around the world. I was impressed by Mekhennet's remarkable ability to relate the truths of others, even when she personally disagrees with them. I think there is great power in being able to understand others, even if you ultimately believe their thinking to be flawed. Mekhennet encounters troubles when Westerners believe that communicating someone else's story and beliefs means agreeing with them. She also has trouble with Islamic interviewees when she is seen as being too hard on their beliefs. In both cases she refuses to compromise and puts sharing the truth above her reputation. In her writing, Mekhennet brings a humanity to every person she meets. That's no easy feat when some of the people she's describing would happily murder many Westerners. But Mekhennet exposes some of the root causes of extremism and shows how easily young people can be lost to manipulative extremist leaders in the current conditions. She is even able to uncover the identify of an ISIS leader through fantastic investigative journalism which had me on the edge of my seat. Ultimately, her stories will make you think long and hard about the decisions our governments make and maybe even some of the decisions you make in your personal life.

For those unfamiliar with current events in the Mideast, this book serves as a great primer on the various crises that have plagued the region since 2003. I connected strongly to Mekhennet's underlying theme of the identity crises that emerge from being Middle Eastern-in-the-Western-diaspora. It felt so validating to read about the same struggles from the perspective of a successful and inspiring woman. My only criticism is that I found her analysis of jihadism in Europe and the Mideast to be a bit superficial and ignorant of power structures. Mekhennet was constantly challenging the jihadis with an argument along the lines of, \"Well, not *all* Westerners are like that!\" as a rebuttal to the reasons they claim for going to war with the West. Though the statement is obviously true, it's simply not the point. Greater systems of power are at work here. I agree with the author's claim that many Westerners and those in the Mideast have effectively de-humanized each other, allowing for destructive foreign policy and terrorist attacks to take place, but I hope that our dialogue can progress from trying to challenge jihadis with \"Well my white friend Bob doesn't hate Muslims!\" to an honest, frank discussion of each sides' perspectives that have brought us to where we are today. We need to have conversations about educational and professional opportunities for Muslim immigrants in Europe, and how there's a direct correlation between the lack of them and likelihood that they'll be persuaded to enter jihadist circles. We need to talk about immigrant family structures and how we can strengthen them when they face racism and other advserity in the West. We need to talk about the anti-Muslim and ant-Arab rhetoric in Europe that further alienates the young men and women vulnerable to jihadist influence. We should no longer settle for Buzzfeed videos and articles attempting to show that Not All Muslims Are Evil following a terrorist attack.

The entire book, and really the author's career, has been dedicated to understanding that pervasive question: Why do they hate us? For the West, why do jihadists and terrorists hate America and Europe? And for those engaging in terrorism, why do they hate the West? Each chapter covers a few years about her reporting in a country about a specific terrorism issue. Through her family's story, we read brief summaries of certain influential events in the Middle East leading up to the 2000s. She covers post 9/11 terrorism, the Iraq War, leading to Arab Spring, and then the formation and rise of ISIS. While the book is not strictly history, and she conveys issues from her perspective rather than it being a chronological or holistic view, a clear trend begins to arise - - the inability of either side to truly listen to one another. Young men from two generations follow the lure of terrorism in search of a string community where they feel ostracized from their society. Men and women become radicalized. And time and time again, both sides engage in devious tactics to achieve their goals. I would have liked to also have excerpts of her articles. She writes so much about what's she working on that it feels like the article is missing to close each chapter. And, like most journalists who write books, the stories could benefit from a more liberal use of non chronological storytelling.Her adventures (to use the word lightly) are sometimes terrifying. I had to put the book down and take a break a few times. She deals with serious issues and doesn't hold back in describing her close calls and also the families she meets who have suffered extreme trauma. The epilogue is especially beautiful and resonant. She seeks to finally answer that question based in her years of reporting. In the end, as she says, it's not about sides - it's about who wants to build walls, and who wants to build bridges. Highly, highly recommend for a survey of why the Middle East is the way it is with a focus on specific incidents that may have been overlooked by most people. Truly starts to explain the allure of jihadism and why the world is the way it is."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1879479-susan", "userReview": "Reading \"I Was Told to Come Alone: My Journey Behind the Lines of Jihad\" will tell the reader much of what there is to know about the current state of affairs in the world regarding Shia vs. Sunni, immigration, attitudes toward Muslims, and perhaps why some are becoming radicalized into global terrorism. Souad Mekhennet, born in Germany to Muslim parents of Morocco descent, is a correspondent for The Washington Post and has reported on terrorism for NPR, The International Herald Tribune, and The New York Times. In this memoir she tells of her dangerous experiences behind the lines of jihad. Early on, she was able to interview Iraqis in Hamburg who were connected to the plotters of 9/11; she explains how Sunni and Shia are turned against each other; how ISIS is a presence on the Turkish-Syria border; and how the initial optimism of the Arab Spring did not come to fruition. Through her European investigations Mekhennet broke the story about the identity of Jihadi John, the ISIS executioner. Because of her background, she has been able to gain access to some of the world's most notorious men in the circles of Al Queda, ISIS, and the Taliban often at great risk to herself. Exploring \"why do they hate us so much?\" Mekhennet's memoir makes one consider the hazards of setting standards for others as if our way is the right and only way. She asks: \"Is democracy really what we want, or do we instead seek to promote the values we hold dear: the equality of men and women, the rights of minorities to survive and thrive, the freedom to speak our minds and practice whatever faith we choose? Instead of talking about the need for a voting system, we should seek to a code of universal values.\" Also, \"dialogue is overdue within Islam, and within Muslim societies, about what can and cannot be justified by our faith.\"This is a compelling read."}, {"userName": "LeseMaus", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33589607-lesemaus", "userReview": "#Rezension \ud83d\udc2d\ud83d\udc2d\ud83d\udc2d\ud83d\udc2d\ud83d\udc2dSouad Mekhennet\"Nur wenn du alleine kommst\"-Sachbuch-Das Buch ist eine Biografie des Grauens, das wir, die westliche Welt mit gez\u00fcchtet und mit gen\u00e4hrt haben. Ein Buch, nicht nur \u00fcber die Zerrissenheit eines Landes, sondern einer ganzen Region.Ich m\u00f6chte mit meinem Fazit beginnen:\"Wenn du was verstehen m\u00f6chtest, dann musst du dich damit besch\u00e4ftigen.\"Und so bin ich an dieses Buch herangegangen. Die Journalistin zeigt die Dynamik der Radikalisierung auf, die nicht nur f\u00fcr die islamistischen Gruppierungen gilt, sondern auf alle Formen des Extremismus. Auch sie m\u00f6chte verstehen, wie die jungen Menschen \"ticken\", die sich dem Dschihad anschlie\u00dfen und so macht sie sich auf den Weg, der auch eine Reise in ihre Vergangenheit ist. Sie redet nicht \u00fcber die Menschen, sondern mit ihnen und so ist ein \"Thriller\" entstanden, der es in sich hat, denn dieser Thriller ist die Realit\u00e4t. Gespannt und gefesselt, teils sprachlos und fassungslos habe ich dieses Buch gelesen, immer mit der Angst, irgendwas zu verpassen. Ich konnte es nur kapitelweise lesen, um auch die F\u00fclle der Informationen zu erfassen und auch zu verarbeiten. Hier bietet sich ein Blick hinter die Fassaden und Regionen, die ich aus den Nachrichten kenne. Souad Mekhennet gelingt ein Sachbuch, das keinem Thriller hinterher steht. Mit einer Sprache und einem Stil, der mir leicht zug\u00e4nglich war, hebt sie sich von vielen Sachb\u00fcchern ab und schreibt \u00fcber Menschen, L\u00e4nder und den gelebten Islam, der so unterschiedlich ist, wie die Menschen, die dort leben. Eine ganz klare Leseempfehlung f\u00fcr ein Buch, das mir viele Fragen beantworten konnte und viele Dinge erkl\u00e4ren konnte und auf die ich jetzt noch kritischer sehen werde. Und mittlerweile kann ich vieles verstehen, auch wenn mir weitestgehend das Verst\u00e4ndnis fehlt."}], "description": "\u201cI was told to come alone. I was not to carry any identification, and would have to leave my cell phone, audio recorder, watch, and purse at my hotel. . . .\u201dFor her whole life, Souad Mekhennet, a reporter for The Washington Post who was born and educated in Germany, has had to balance the two sides of her upbringing \u2013 Muslim and Western. She has also sought to provide a mediating voice between these cultures, which too often misunderstand each other.In this compelling and evocative memoir, we accompany Mekhennet as she journeys behind the lines of jihad, starting in the German neighborhoods where the 9/11 plotters were radicalized and the Iraqi neighborhoods where Sunnis and Shia turned against one another, and culminating on the Turkish/Syrian border region where ISIS is a daily presence. In her travels across the Middle East and North Africa, she documents her chilling run-ins with various intelligence services and shows why the Arab Spring never lived up to its promise. She then returns to Europe, first in London, where she uncovers the identity of the notorious ISIS executioner \u201cJihadi John,\u201d and then in France, Belgium, and her native Germany, where terror has come to the heart of Western civilization.Mekhennet\u2019s background has given her unique access to some of the world\u2019s most wanted men, who generally refuse to speak to Western journalists. She is not afraid to face personal danger to reach out to individuals in the inner circles of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, ISIS, and their affiliates; when she is told to come alone to an interview, she never knows what awaits at her destination.Souad Mekhennet is an ideal guide to introduce us to the human beings behind the ominous headlines, as she shares her transformative journey with us.
