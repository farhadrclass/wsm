Her beloved brother returns to the States to protect the family\u2019s Kentucky homestead, and Union sympathizers burn their Carson City home, killing her parents and little sister and leaving her alone and at risk. To make matters worse, she\u2019s injured in the blaze and whisked away to cattleman Jake Bennett\u2019s ranch deep in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, far from civilization.Realizing the danger Jess is in, Jake takes it upon himself to protect her, which is no easy task considering the fact that she can\u2019t stomach the sight of him, blames him for her father\u2019s death and tries to escape at the first opportunity. But that\u2019s fine by Jake. He doesn\u2019t intend to lose his heart to a firebrand like Jess when he\u2019s got his own set of troubles--just keep her safe. Both struggle to deal with their emotional scars independently until they trust the Lord with their hurts and heartaches and allow Him to bring healing.Tammy Barley has crafted an action-packed adventure that pulled me in and kept me entertained from first page to last. Plot twists aplenty, nice touches of humor and deep emotion kept me turning the pages eager to see what would happen next. Jess, a spirited heroine who hides her softer side, wound her way into my heart. Jake is the consummate hero, with a caring nature beneath his sun-bronzed, take-charge exterior, whom I fell for--hard. Barley sprinkles the story with a liberal helping of secondary characters who people the ranch and add a nice blend of sweetness and spice.Love\u2019s Rescue, Barley\u2019s debut novel, is one of the best books I\u2019ve read this year, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes inspirational Western historicals. I look forward to the sequel, Hope\u2019s Promise, and the opportunity to spend more time with Jake and Jess."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1362705-jane", "userReview": "Love's Rescue is a good title for this book. Jake rescues Jess because he knows she would be in danger when her house was set afire and her family all perished that were in the house. Jess kept trying to run away but Jake had his ranch hands on alert to not let her for her own safety. Also he understood the grief she was dealing with and knew it would take time for it to heal. Jess loved her brother so much that when she found out he was imprisoned in a Union camp and still alive she plans to go rescue him. But by this time Jake has caught onto her ways and his men and him are ready to go help her. I got a chuckle out of the scene where she tries to sneak out of Motel and go alone and they are all waiting for her. But that is near end of story so you have to read the whole book before you realize how much the ranch hands had grown to love and care about Jess.This book will grip you and draw you in from the very beginning and keep your interest all the way to the end. Indians, cowboys, soldiers and faith all in one. I loved the way the scriptures were used all through the book like in real life when a person is going through a difficulty. I went through a couple of rough periods and this book uplifted me and kept me uplifted to overcome them.The book will show you the depths of true love people can have for one ano"}, {"userName": "SheLove2Read", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1708674-shelove2read", "userReview": "If I had a shelf for \"heroine singlehandedly ruined the book\", this would be on it.

To escape the ravages of war, Jessica Hale\u2019s family leaves their beloved home in Kentucky for a new life in the Nevada Territory. Jessica\u2019s brother, Ambrose, is determined to help defend their southern homestead. Against his father\u2019s wishes, the young man joins ranks with the Kentucky militia and returns to the south. When Ambrose goes missing in the midst of the War Between the States, Jessica\u2019s attempts to find him set off a chain of events that will change her life forever. In the wake of a close encounter with political fanatics, Jessica loses everything that matters and then finds herself spirited away to a remote ranch in the Sierra Nevada wilderness. There, Jessica\u2019s every effort to escape is thwarted by handsome rancher Jake Bennett and his loyal cattlemen.Jake knows what it\u2019s like to lose everything. He\u2019s determined to protect Jessica through her time of loss. There are those who would harm the young woman for nothing more than being a Southerner, and Jake and his men have no intention of allowing that to happen. Still, how can he help Jessica\u2019s wounded heart to heal when she so deeply resents him for what she perceives as his failure to save her family? He can\u2019t make her see the truth, but he can protect her, and he can pray while her eyes are opened and her broken heart mends.Tammy Barley\u2019s action-packed debut novel is wonderfully rich in historical detail. It\u2019s a tightly woven, riveting tale of love and loss, faith under fire, and wild hearts on the run. As the author unfolds this spellbinding story, a vivid picture of life in the Old West is revealed with stunning clarity and depth. Love\u2019s Rescue provides everything a reader expects from this era: cowboys and Indians, damsels in distress, good guys and bad hombres, gunfights and moonlit nights. The last page leaves the reader longing for more of Jess and Jake. It\u2019s an absolute must-read for the lover of historical romance.A masterpiece of storytelling intricately woven with spiritual wisdom and insight, and threaded throughout with the good, the bad, and the ugly of love, life, and humanity.

To escape the escalating conflict, Jessica Hale\u2019s parents decide to flee their Kentucky home and head for the Nevada Territory. This is good news for the parents who make a fortune selling expensive goods to those who strike gold. But then Jessica\u2019s brother, Ambrose, decides to head home to Kentucky and defend the family land\u2014and joins the Kentucky militia, resulting in his being disowned. When Jessica attempts to send a telegram to someone to get information about her brother, the family is presumed to be Confederate, and Unionists set a fire to her home, murdering her family.

Leaving Jessica wondering\u2014what happened to Ambrose? Why did God allow her family to be killed, but spare her? And why is Jake Bennett so determined to keep her in the Nevada wilderness?LOVE\u2019S RESCUE is Ms. Barley\u2019s debut novel, and the first book in her The Sierra Chronicles series. I enjoyed taking a new and different look at the Civil War era and how it affected people, even those assumedly far from the conflict. Jessica is a realistically developed heroine who only wanted to keep her family together and keep in contact with her brother, but ended up losing almost everything dear to her as a result. A heartrending beginning, but the story does end up showing an important lesson about forgiveness. $6.99. 400 pages."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15247587-angela", "userReview": "This series is set during the Civil War, but is told from a different perspective than other Civil War books. The story line is definitely affected by the Civil War, as Jessica is from the South and although they have moved to the West, her Southern accent sets many people against her and her family. Although her family does not believe in slavery, her brother Ambrose decides he needs to go an fight for their home they left behind in Kentucky. This almost destroys Jessica as Ambrose in so many ways is her rock ... her big brother whom she adores and his leaving causes so much hurt in her family that her father disowns him. Tragedy hits this family, and Jake a friend of her father's who owns a cattle ranch is in the right place at the right time.There are so many ups and downs. The author has made Jessica a very strong-willed young woman who knows what she wants and how to get it. Jake is a man who is used to taking care of the people he cares about and where he definitely admires the strength he sees in Jessica this causes friction throughout their lives.The book also has many characters that you can easily like and shows how love, compassion, and kindness can help anyone survive even the worst of situations."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4181239-linda", "userReview": "The Hale family has built a profitable business in Colorado after leaving their ancestral home in Kentucky while the children, Ambrose and Jessica, were young. Now they are both grown up, and Ambrose leaves to return to fight for Kentucky in the Civil War. Branded as traitors by Northern extremists, Jessica's family is killed when they burn down her house. Jessica is spared and is taken to Jake Bennett's ranch where she can heal and stay out of danger, since everyone believes that she was also killed in the fire. Over time Jessica learns to love ranch life and love Jake, but her stubbornness and fear of losing cause her to keep her distance. The author really created a great cast of characters; I got a little tired of Jess always demanding her own way though. I was very pleased with the love story....true to life pure love & romance without unrealistic sex thrown in, and realistic Christian values that weren't preachy or gratuitous. Jake is almost too good to be true though...can't wait to start the sequel!"}, {"userName": "LAWonder10", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4300103-lawonder10", "userReview": "This is a great, well-written and clean novel about tragedy, adventure, relationships and romance. The time frame is during the Civil War. Jess's beloved brother and best friend is disowned by his father for turning away from their new western home and family business to defend their home and property in Kentucky by fighting for the Confederacy. Jess maintains close contact with him until suddenly the letters stop. In desperation she goes to the city to send a telegram when trouble breaks out. This is a time of great upheaval and intolerance of others yet good people existed and accepted others whose views and lifestyles were different. Jess was fortunate to find that type of environment during great tragedy. The plot was slightly dragged out and the ending was weak but the story was great and, again, well-written.

I picked it up never having heard of it or read by the author, Tammy Barley, but I found it to be an interesting, beautiful read that tugged at my heart.Love's Rescue is the first book in The Sierra Chronicles series. It is set during the Civil War, and avidly describes the hatred between the battling countrymen and the despairing conditions of army prisons. Though the war is a big part in this story, it is centered on a bustling ranch that is tucked away from the bloody battles.This novel combines heart-ach, and joys, irrational fear, and everlasting love. It tells a beautiful tale of letting go of fear and embracing God's peace and will.Don't miss Jessica and Jake's bittersweet, tender story in Love's Rescue."}, {"userName": "Carman", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2527853-carman", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this one! All the ranch happenings were really fun to read about and didn\u2019t get so detailed that you were bored. The way Tammy skipped long periods of time was very well written. Since this book takes place over a few years, she couldn\u2019t include all the day-to-day occurrences; I think she wrote the book in a way that the gaps weren\u2019t missed and it was still easy to follow the storyline. The civil war era is one of my favorites to read about, and this book didn\u2019t disappoint. I loved the way Tammy wrote the cowhands! They are now some of my favorite characters. I especially loved how gentle and protective they were with Jess. It was too sweet!

I felt like I was out on the ranch with the characters, even to the point I could feel the warm sun and the breeze.Downsides was that the Christian characters spoke so Christianly to each other I think I got diabeetus -- Now, I love Jesus. Don't get me wrong. But if I had just lost my family and someone started quoting Romans 8 at me, no matter HOW hot he is, I'd punch that someone in the face.
