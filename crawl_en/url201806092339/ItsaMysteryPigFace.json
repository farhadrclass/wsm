But when Tracy's annoying little brother Lester, aka Pig Face, becomes part of the team, he ends up playing a vital role Tracy could've never predicted.In the process, Tracy comes to see her neighbors, herself, and even Pig Face in new and surprising ways.

Their summer vacation starts off with a few surprises when they discover a bagful of money and then Tracy\u2019s annoying little brother, Lester (Pig Face) discovers them with the money. The three set out to solve the mystery, return the loot, and become heroes\u2014just like in the old-time movies they like to watch. The story is peppered with spot-on Middle Grade humor, sibling discord, and friendship angst. Friendship is a major theme in the book. Tracy and Ralph\u2019s relationship is challenged by newcomer, Zach\u2014a slick heartthrob from glamorous New York City. Tracy also contends with her archrival, Jasmine. Both grow as the story progresses and come to a new understanding of each other. Through a mix of dramatic action and nail-biting scenes, Tracy gains appreciation for her annoying little brother as well. Ralph\u2019s passion for cooking and Tracy\u2019s quirky style emerge triumphant even after the book\u2019s many trials. By the time the mystery was solved, I was saddened to leave St. Stephens and my new buds. I\u2019m sure MG readers will feel the same. This is a great contemporary title to recommend for readers who like mysteries and who want to meet some new friends in a story!"}, {"userName": "Wade White", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25257108-wade-white", "userReview": "It\u2019s a Mystery, Pig Face! has all the things I want in a book: humour, drama, secrets, adventure, and a kid called Pig Face. MacKnight has woven a sweet tale of friendship and family, first crushes and rivalries, all centered around a mystery full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing. Tracy, her younger brother Lester, and her best friend Ralph are wonderful, quirky, well-rounded characters with just enough misguided good intentions to get themselves into a heap of trouble and the heart and determination to find their way back out again. I also love that the adults in the story have real lives and feelings and play an important role in how everything unfolds.

Eleven-year-old Tracy Munroe's first-person narration about a stash of mysterious cash found in her quiet town of St. Stephen helped me pass the time. Tracy, her little brother Lester (aka Pig Face), and her best bud Ralph make for fun (and funny) reading. They may not make the best sleuthing team, but the lessons they learn along the way about Belgian chocolate, true friendship, and the importance of being true to oneself is bigger than any reward. The closing chapters had me cheering."}, {"userName": "Tanaz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4175142-tanaz", "userReview": "\u201cWe don\u2019t need grown-ups!

Simple, right? Except they do not count on the following:1. Lester discovering them and forcing himself onto their adventure! 2. Turning on each other!3. Being accused of stealing the money themselves! Wendy McLeod MacKnight\u2019s charming middle-grade debut had me chuckling nearly throughout the entire read. There are so many clever lines and witty descriptions. For instance:\"[Lester] managed to right himself and started for the door, only to fall over again. He reminded me of the little dog, Max, in How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\" Lester is, by far, my favourite character in this book and his sibling rivalry with Tracy is perfectly and realistically portrayed! I also adored Tracy and Ralph\u2019s friendship and the ups and downs it goes through as new friends (and enemies) enter the picture.Recommended for anyone who enjoys stories about friendship and family and hilarious childhood adventures."}, {"userName": "Corabel Shofner", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15935269-corabel-shofner", "userReview": "Summer days.

There's only one thing standing in their way: Pig Face (well, Lester), Tracy's annoying little brother.

Best friends Tracy and Ralph were hoping for a great summer before going into 6th grade, but they never bargained for what they got. The cast of supporting characters include Tracy's 9-year-old pain-in-the-neck brother, her arch-enemy Jasmine, the great-looking new-boy-in-town Zach, and even Tracy's weird neighbor Hazel McNutt. All of them together develop a really great story which asks the question, What is a friend and how do you recognize one when you see them.I think juvenile readers will really like this gently, told story. No animals are harmed in the writing of this book or the telling of this story, and I think that makes the book even more approachable. This will be a great choice for a class read aloud or for literature circles or book club.

She really liked it and wanted to keep reading and not put it down. The mystery was interesting and all through the story she kept trying to figure out who had stolen the money. The characters were fun and she could relate to them. We laughed and enjoyed this story. Our only complaint was that the ending seemed to drag out, once the mystery was solved we were ready for it to end, but it seemed like tying up all the loose ends and trying to wrap it all up nice and neat and perfect took about 30 pages more than necessary.

The mystery unfolds over the course of a couple weeks after 11-year-old Tracy Munroe, hipster vintage clothing fan and lover of old Humphrey Bogart movies, and her BFF and baker-extraordinaire Ralph, find a paper bag of money stashed under a dugout bench at the local baseball field. After they\u2019re forced, under great duress, to accept the help of Tracy's younger brother Lester, aka Pig Face, the mystery of how the money got to be there, who might have stolen it, and who it belongs to, is in full, and often hilarious, swing. The story moves along at a nice clip, with the pages flying fast and furious in the last quarter. The humour will definitely appeal to middle grade readers, who will also likely find themselves relating to some of the lessons Tracy learns along the way, including the cost of jumping to conclusions, and putting the new kid-next-door (even if he is gorgeous, hails from New York, and loves musicals) before bros and best friends."}, {"userName": "Kathie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9985756-kathie", "userReview": "This is a fun MG mystery with a colourful cast of characters.When Tracy discover a bag filled with money at the baseball dugout, she and her friend, Ralph, and little brother Lester (aka Pig Face) decide to solve the mystery of where the money came from, and find the owner, by themselves.

The story reminded me so much of my own childhood, of running around the neighborhood all summer, secret hang outs, first crushes, best friendships, annoying siblings (although in my case, I was Pig Face - ha!). What endeared me most was the way MacKnight developed the characters, Tracy in particular -- a bighearted old soul girl next door. She and I would've been fast friends.
