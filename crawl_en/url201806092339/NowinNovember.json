She is ten, when her father loses his Job in the lumberyard and takes up tenant farming, land for which he takes on a ten year mortgage. Her elder sister Kerran and her younger sister Merle, mother and father, a father ill suited to farming but due to the depression has little recourse. Beautiful prose, the writing is outstanding and the story has a depth to it that I found amazing. Not only do we learn of the different personalities of the sisters, but we see how varied their responses are to the hardships they encounter. There are of course hardships a plenty, the weather, drought, things they cannot control. Prices and the manipulation of these, always one step away from disaster, losing everything. Marget loves the land, her descriptions of the beauty, the changing season are wonderful, expressive. Likewise her descriptions of this same land dying, horrible to experience. This is a hard, well thought out look at a family struggling against nature that can be both beautiful and cruel. It is told in a linear and consecutive manner which I felt both heightened the impact and my understanding of how these hardworking people were effected by the economy and nature itself.This book was published in the thirties, people still reeling from the depression and it was very well received. The author was only in her twenties when this was written and I find the maturity in her writing simply amazing. There was an afterward that explains much and this gave me an additional understanding of what this novel was portraying. I don't always agree with prize winning books but in this case I believe they got it right."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "I\u2019d never heard of this 1935 Pulitzer Prize winner before I saw a large display of titles from publisher Head of Zeus\u2019s new imprint, Apollo, at Foyles bookshop in London. Apollo, which launched with eight titles in April, aims to bring lesser-known classics out of obscurity: by making \u201cgreat forgotten works of fiction available to a new generation of readers,\u201d it intends to \u201cchallenge the established canon and surprise readers.\u201dMissouri-born Johnson was just 24 years old when she published Now in November. The novel is narrated by the middle Haldmarne daughter, Marget, looking back at a grueling decade on the family farm. She recognizes how unsuited her father, Arnold, was to farming: \u201cHe hadn\u2019t the resignation that a farmer has to have \u2013 that resignation which knows how little use to hope or hate.\u201d The remaining members of this female-dominated household are mother Willa, older sister Kerrin and younger sister Merle. Half-feral Kerrin is a creature apart. She\u2019s always doing something unpredictable, like demonstrating knife-throwing to disastrous effect or taking over as the local schoolteacher, a job she\u2019s not at all right for.The arrival of Grant Koven, a neighbor in his thirties hired to help Arnold with hard labor, seems like the only thing that might break the agricultural cycle of futile hope and disappointment. Marget quickly falls in love with him, but it takes her a while to realize that her sisters are smitten too. They all keep hoping their fortunes will change:\u2018This year will have to be different,\u2019 I thought. \u2018We\u2019ve scrabbled and prayed too long for it to end as the others have.\u2019 The debt was still like a bottomless swamp unfilled, where we had gone year after year, throwing in hours of heat and the wrenching on stony land, only to see them swallowed up and then to creep back and begin again.Yet as drought settles in, things only get worse. The fear of losing everything becomes a collective obsession; a sense of insecurity pervades the community. The Ramseys, black tenant farmers with nine children, are evicted. Milk producers go on strike and have to give the stuff away before it sours. Nature is indifferent and neither is there a benevolent God at work: when the Haldmarnes go to church, they are refused communion as non-members.Marget skips around in time to pinpoint the central moments of their struggle, her often fragmentary thoughts joined by ellipses \u2013 a style that seemed to me ahead of its time:if anything could fortify me against whatever was to come [\u2026] it would have to be the small and eternal things \u2013 the whip-poor-wills\u2019 long liquid howling near the cave\u2026 the shape of young mules against the ridge, moving lighter than bucks across the pasture\u2026 things like the chorus of cicadas, and the ponds stained red in evenings.Michael Schmidt, the critic who selected the first eight Apollo books, likens Now in November to the work of two very different female writers: Marilynne Robinson and Emily Bront\u00eb. What I think he is emphasizing with those comparisons is the sense of isolation and the feeling that struggle is writ large on the landscape. The Haldmarne sisters certainly wander the nearby hills like the Bront\u00eb sisters did the Yorkshire moors.As points of reference I would also add Jane Smiley\u2019s A Thousand Acres and Joan Chase\u2019s \nDuring the Reign of the Queen of Persia\n (resurrected by NYRB Classics in 2014), which also give timeless weight to the female experience of Midwest farming. Like the Smiley, Now in November stars a trio of sisters and makes conscious allusions to King Lear. Kerrin reads the play and thinks of their father as Lear, while Marget quotes it as a prophecy that the worst is yet to come: \u201cI remembered the awful words in Lear: \u2018The worst is not so long as we can say \u201cThis is the worst.\u201d\u2019 Already this year, I\u2019d cried, This is enough! uncounted times, and the end had never come.\u201dJohnson lived to age 80 and published another 11 books, but nothing ever lived up to the success of her first. This is an atmospheric and strangely haunting novel. The plot is simple enough, but the writing elevates it into something special. The plaintive tone, the folksy metaphors, and the philosophical earnestness all kept me eagerly traveling along with Marget to see where this tragic story might lead. Apollo has done the literary world a great favor in bringing this lost classic to light.With thanks to Blake Brooks at Head of Zeus for the free copy.Originally published with images on my blog, Bookish Beck."}, {"userName": "Scott Axsom", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7099104-scott-axsom", "userReview": "Now in November is arguably the most relentlessly tragic novel I've read and, yet, I loved it. Josephine W. Johnson tells the grinding story of a year (and more) in the life of a farming family during the Dust Bowl. In it, she paints a highly detailed picture of the bucolic life that preceded this environmental catastrophe as well as the inexorable extinguishment of hope that accompanied it. She creates a world in which the peach blossoms of a bountiful spring are eventually replaced by drought-stricken maples whose dying leaves look like the \"folded wings of bats\".The subtle lyricism of Johnson's style is the binding force of this poignant telling. She portrays in tender prose the powerful communion with nature that takes place with some regularity on a farm and she does so firmly within the context of the brutalizing effects of the bare subsistence existence that was farming life in America in the 1930's. The story is told through the eyes of the middle sister of three, and she is plagued through most of the telling by a love unrequited. This, in turn, serves as the perfect analog for the passionate and tireless devotion this family pours into their farmstead, only to have all of their efforts come undone by the simple act of nature's withholding, in this case, of rain. The remote, masculine beauty of the man she can't have serves as the maddening personification of imagined bounty from a farm, and from a life, that never quite comes to fruition.I deeply appreciated Johnson's skill as a writer and even more so for the fact that she created this insightful telling, populated by honest, recognizable characters and glorious, lyrical descriptions, all before she reached the age of twenty-five. As first novels go, Josephine Johnson's Now in November is a formidable achievement, well-deserving of the Pulitzer it received and, once I've had a good cry, a whisky and a long soak, I may be ready to tackle some of her subsequent works."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "Opening: Now in November I can see our years as a whole.This autumn is like both an end and a beginning to our lives, and those days which seemed confused with the blur of all things too near and too familiar are clear and strange now.Well over expected enjoyment levels with this and I just so love pleasant surprises.

(One of the characters is even named \u201cWilla,\u201d--probably a nod toward Cather who was clearly an influence on the author.) While the writing in Now in November isn\u2019t nearly as strong as any of those great three, it\u2019s still worth a read. The Haldemarnes are a repressed and frightened family struggling desperately to hold on to their farm during a long drought in the middle of the Depression. Told from the perspective of Marget, the middle of three sisters, the story looks at what happens when six people\u2014two of them deeply problematic\u2014are faced with terrible hardship, loneliness and, in some cases, fatal bad luck.Johnson does an especially good job describing women, often pairing them with something from the natural world. Here is Merle, Marget\u2019s sister, making jam during the beginning of the drought. \u201cFor Merle there was a sort of glory in all things, a haloed way of seeing them\u2014I do not know how to tell it\u2026in everything she saw or did. In the stoning of cherries and the acid stain in her skin, and the heat and confusion of their preserving\u2026the stove raging and too hot to come near, and the steam from the boiling glasses, cherries dissolving into a rich syrup-redness. She stormed among the kettles, tasting and slopping--shouted Whoa! and Haw! to the cherries pouring over, dripped wax with one hand and stirred with the other, and sniffed at the strong smell of burned juice blackening where the stuff boiled over. I don\u2019t know what it was\u2014only health perhaps, too much to be contained inside and radiating out like her over-stoked ovens\u2026.The smell of boiling cherries was sweet enough, with a good acid tang, but I kept thinking of how the sugar was getting down and wished that Merle would put less in and see if they\u2019d keep that way. I wondered what good all the fruit was going to do us if we couldn\u2019t pay for even the jar-rings soon.\u201d This novel won a Pulitzer in 1935, when the author was only 24, and looking at its strengths, I can see why. In addition to great characters and poetic descriptions, there are subtle statements about politics, race, gender and people\u2019s relationships with nature that no doubt caused a lot of discussion at the time. So why only three stars? For starters, even though this book has sexual tension, unrequited love, mental illness, natural disaster and the threat of homelessness, it\u2019s still surprisingly slow reading. There\u2019s something about the cadence of the writing that makes it, not boring exactly, but lacking in urgency. The protagonist is so meditative and so detailed in her thinking that it slows down the pace. Yet, don\u2019t let that discourage you if you have even the slightest interest in reading this book! Marget and her sad family still feel alive and relevant 80 years later."}, {"userName": "Daniel Villines", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2266055-daniel-villines", "userReview": "My paternal grandparents lived through Great Depression on farms located in Arkansas and Oklahoma. In discussing their lives as they existed during these difficult times, they were always staid in their responses, seemingly in direct contrast to the lives and events depicted in Now in November. This is not to say that Now in November is not true to history. In fact, the stoicism expressed by my grandparents while describing their experiences may point out why Now in November is so important to history.My grandparents survived and lived through this period under the protection of their parents. They then lived as young adults through WWII and experienced their own struggles in raising their five sons in the years following the war. If their responses to my questions were casual, then those responses serve to show how benign history can become over time and how obscured history can be in the moment.Now in November is straight-up realism. There is no way for the history depicted in this book to diminish over time and the history it depicts is true to life. The characters love the land for its peaceful beauty and hate it for its selfish ways. The meagerness of farming on mortgaged land is in the forefront of the novel. The story stresses the futility of imagining a better tomorrow when all of one\u2019s labor is consumed by physical and financial survival. And when survival is all that\u2019s being accomplished, devastation is only a matter of chance. Now in November is all this within a very few number of pages. It\u2019s concentrated history that will not fade over time."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14682014-tiffany", "userReview": "Now in November was a fantastic read for me. This is coming from a to be 16 year old girl. I would have never read or even heard of this book if it wasn't for an English assignment I had to do on Pulitzer Prize winners. I've never read a book like this before. I've always kept my range of books around the genre of fantasy. This was a truly breathtaking experience for me. There were several passages that I had to read over several times just to pick up all the information. Not in a bad way, of course, but because it was just too mind blowing. The beginning was slow, as most beginnings are. I honestly have to say this is one of the best books I've read, ever. It's definitely in my top 5, and Josephine Johnson's words hit me in such a deep way that I became truly passionate for the novel. I have many quotes from the book pinned up in my room from when I did my assignment. Reading the book was a journey. If you really read and feel the book, that is. I've lived through the year with the Haldmarne family. I suffered with them. I was given memories and an experience that weren't truly mine. I hope to read Now in November again very soon.

If you are a reader who needs an active plot, with twists and turns, this book is not for you.

The novel moves through a single year and, at the same time, a decade of years, from the spring arrival of the family at their mortgaged farm to the winter 10 years later, when the ravages of drought, fire, and personal anguish have led to the deaths of two of the five. Like Ethan Frome, the relatively brief, intense story evokes the torment possible among people isolated and driven by strong feelings of love and hate that, unexpressed, lead inevitably to doom. Reviewers in the thirties praised the novel, calling its prose \"profoundly moving music,\" expressing incredulity \"that this mature style and this mature point of view are those of a young women in her twenties,\" comparing the book to \"the luminous work of Willa Cather,\" and, with prescience, suggesting that it \"has that rare quality of timelessness which is the mark of first-rate fiction.\"", "title": "Now in November", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/267115.Now_in_November", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390983337l/267115.jpg", "reviews": 86, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/736298.Josephine_Winslow_Johnson", "name": "Josephine Winslow Johnson"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/199451.Nancy_Hoffman", "name": "Nancy Hoffman"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Classics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/267115.Now_in_November", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27908523-now-in-november", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18476594-now-in-november", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2702515-now-in-november", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1687197.Now_in_November", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33948939-ora-che-novembre", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25589452-il-viaggiatore-oscuro", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2678041-the-inland-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2990440-seven-houses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3712363-florence-farr", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34367591-wildwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
