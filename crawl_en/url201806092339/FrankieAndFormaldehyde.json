At all. They're yucky and creepy and I'm very glad they only live in the land of make-believe. *shudder* The only reason I started reading Frankie & Formaldehyde is because I've enjoyed M. Jones' other works, particularly 314 Crescent Manor. I'm glad I pushed past my zombie bigotry for this novel. It's a fantastic, fun, and philosophical read.Former retiree Frankie works 80 hours per week at the Happy Restful Afterlife Home. Why afterlife? Because Osmosis Industries, Inc. is peddling the Osmosis 37 enzyme, which grants life everlasting to the deceased who can afford the treatment. The trouble is that the undead devolve into mindless, rotting, flesh-eating animals. Grief and Osmosis' marketing machine have blinded much of the populace to this fact. Consequently, Osmosis has built tens of \"afterlife homes\" to keep their dead customers from consuming their living ones. Jones has thought out the ramifications of this horrific business model and weaves them through the novel.Frankie toils to support her husband George, who'd been incapacitated by a stroke. George died in his sleep... and woke up. He's a \"rogue,\" albeit a mysteriously benign one. Although it's a capital offense to harbor rogue undead, George is still Frankie's husband. There's a bit of his soul in his pasty-skinned corpse. Frankie can't bring herself to turn George over to Osmosis, or worse, one of the afterlife homes. So she attempts to maintain the status quo until the other shoe drops, and boy does it ever!The grim setting of Frankie & Formaldehyde is lightened by black comedy and gallows humor. How often do you see a zombie shop for Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts? I never thought I'd root for a zombie, especially one with such tragic fashion sense. I recommend Frankie & Formaldehyde to zombie lovers and haters alike. The romance aspect is almost platonic, so you don't have to worry about mental images of the living getting it on with the dead. It's about life-long relationships, loyalty, and the natural order of things with a healthy dose of wit and social commentary. The novel is kind of a philosophical \"Shaun of the Dead,\" as evidenced by these quotes.\"A man's got to choose how he lives. ... He shouldn't have to choose how he dies.\" \"Live, die, something else lives. The very soil humanity walks upon is built up from death. Digging into a flowerbed means digging into bones.\"\"The Happy Restful. Where all your screams are joyous.\"Frankie & Formaldehyde is available through Smashwords."}, {"userName": "Zoe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/998847-zoe", "userReview": "Frankie and Formaldehyde is a strong story right from the start, and it just keeps building on those strengths as the plot unfolds.Take a zombie nursing home similar to the kind depicted in Michele Lee\u2019s Rot. But instead of magic animating these undead, a corporation, Osmosis, Inc. has created a compound to bring the dead back to life. But unlike most zombie apocalypse stories, Osmosis does not entirely lose control of the situation, and the undead are herded into arenas and fed. Afterward, the company is even selling the compound to grieving family members using predatory ad campaign to prey on peoples\u2019 inability to accept death.Enter into this cold world an elderly woman named Frankie, who along with coworkers Shirley and Larry, shovels rotting meat to the corpses in one of the arenas. She works constantly because Osmosis has taken over her bank and swindled her on her home loan.Did I mention that Frankie\u2019s husband is a zombie? George isn\u2019t like the others, and instead of being a violent \u201crogue\u201d he passes most of his days watching TV and eating bacon raw. But when Frankie leaves her door unlocked in a fit of worrying, George gets outside and begins to uncover a plot by Osmosis to strip everyone\u2019s land. Only...George seems to have discovered this before, back when he was alive...Enter into this mess a S.I.R. investigating office, Chuck. A retired cop know working to investigate and eliminate rogues, Chuck is rightly seen by everyone as the corporate errand boy of Osmosis. Like Frankie, Chuck is in denial about how bad things have gotten, but as the story unfolds, Chuck sees how scummy Osmosis really is. Eventually, he must come to terms with this, but not before confronting George and Frankie in a truly explosive finale. But, this is not a fast-paced story. The cast\u2019s ages range from 40-70 in most cases, so the pace moves a bit slower, befitting the cast\u2019s age. But this is not to say the story is slow or dull. It unfolds at just the right pace and delivers a great ending. There\u2019s resolution, but Shirley predicts that there can be no happy ending. And this is perhaps the most realistic assessment of their future.So to recap, this is a great story premise, a great cast of quirky characters, fantastic dialogue, and a romantic angle that\u2019s all about love and sacrifice and nothing about sex. The scenes were descriptive enough to rip shudders from my jaded black heart, and toward the end, I was giggling gleefully with every line from Shirley or Larry. Can I gush about this story further? Yes, but I\u2019ll spare you.I give Frankie and Formaldehyde 5 enthusiastic stars and recommend it to all zombie and horror fans who like a little brains with their blood and guts."}, {"userName": "Albert", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9227027-albert", "userReview": "I recommend Frankie & Formaldehyde to zombie lovers and haters alike.
