I like the ideas that Caine comes up with but I don't think she's the greatest writer. I find myself distracted while reading her books and not as emotionally connected as I should be. That being said, I liked it enough to want to continue on with the series and find out what happens with the characters.This entry in the series starts right where the first book left off. This left me feeling a little lost though since I read Glass Houses more than a year ago. Fortunately, much of the previous story gets retold in bits and pieces as you read so it's not that hard to remember what had happened. Basically, Shane's Dad is back in town and looking to kill vampires. He gets Claire and the rest of the gang involved and they get in all kinds of trouble. There's some attempted rape, some tortured vampires, and some folded space teleportation. A lot of stuff happens in a short amount of time and it starts to get really unbelievable, especially Claire continually saving the day being a size 2 16 year-old.The only character I really care about is Claire, and she did a lot of stupid things in this book. Actually, Shane, Eve, and Michael all did some stupid things and that's probably one of the reasons I'm having a hard time connecting with them. I do like Shane and Claire's developing romance though.I honestly think Glass Houses and this one should have been made into one book in the first place. And I think that if I had read them back to back I may have enjoyed this one more.Overall, not a bad book, but I'm hoping it improves with the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Chelsea \u2764Peril Please\u2764 ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8422853-chelsea-peril-please", "userReview": "Yeahhhhhh...Sorry dudes.

So, why did I read this?I read it 'cause I'm in the mood for reading a series with around 10 books and if anyone can recommend me something better than this, I'll be very grateful.I read the first part  Glass Houses  a year back, and disliked it too. The concept is just way too stupid. A 16-year old girl starts going to a college (early admission) in a strange town named Morganville. First, if Claire is such a prodigy, what the hell is she doing studying in  Morganville?  Couldn't she have gotten a much better college?Then, she starts getting beaten up by the It-girl gang of the school for NO REASON AT ALL. So she leaves her dorm and goes off to live with some random 3 people who are really weird. Those random weird people tell her that the town is run by Vampires and once you've entered it, you can never escape.This plot is dumb as a fucking doorknob.There are so many flaws and so much of stupidity in it! To add to this traumatically annoying plot we have the dumbest possible characters. Claire, Eve and Michael are so irritatingly dumb, Shane is okay-okay sometimes. Claire doesn\u2019t ever stands up for herself, she always needs someone to keep her going. Plus, she takes some really rash decisions at times which should make her look like a brave chick, instead it puts her friends in more trouble.I, honestly liked the first one better than  Dead Girl\u2019s Dance.  The storyline involving Shane\u2019s dad in this instalment was getting on my nerves and it was pretty unnecessary too. I mean, nothing huge happened at the end, everything went back to the way it was before. But in  Glass Houses  there were a few moments that surprised me and caught my interest (which after a year made me read the 2nd one *rols eyes*). Whereas this one was just dreadful. Everything bored me to death, those good for nothing characters and sissy vampires made me claw my eyes out.I will most probably not continue this series now. My quota of stupidity intake this month is over."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6703235-ian", "userReview": "At the end of book 1 Glass Houses, Shane's psychopathic, vampire hunting father and his band of thugs showed up. The Dead Girls' Dance has him running amok in Morganville. The vampires are hunting him and Claire, Shane, Eve and Michael are the meat in the sandwich. This book has some good things going on, but there are a few things that really annoyed me. The epilogue in the form of diary entries from Eve is tedious. The protagonists spend most of their time whining, and it gets to be a bit much.This still would have been a 3.5 star book if it wasn't for this.\nClaire was feeling kind of light headed, in fact she was dizzy, maybe it was the heat. She took another gulp from the bottle, but that just seemed to make her feel nauseous. As Ian opened the fourth door she said, \"I don't feel so good.\"Ian smiled and said, \"Well that was fast\", and shoved her into the room. \"I thought I was gonna have to work a little harder, but you're pretty easy.\"There were three other guys in the room...There was something bad out there something worse than four horny, stupid, cruel boys. She felt something brush against her, a hand. One of the boys she didn't know which one, was it Ian? She took it and squeezed.[to Ian, the guy who drugged her and was going to rape her] \"I'm sorry about your nose.\" she said.[later] Those boys weren't monsters.\nOK...so in brief, Ian invites her to the party with the intention of slipping her a drug and then gang-raping her with three of his mates. While defending herself from the would be rapists, she cracks Ian in the nose. Later she apologizes to him for defending herself. They all end up hiding in the closet, and one of the would be rapist takes her hand and she squeezes it. Later she thinks, those guys weren't so bad.WTF!!! On what planet is gang rape not so bad??? That scene is so fucked up and I just can't forgive it.

TDGD has not added anything new to the mix for me. I'll list my arguments:1. Claire has known Shane, Eve, and Michael for less than a month and she's willing to sign her life away. I'm not saying love is measured by how long you know someone, but come on! She's 16!2. This girl has dreams of going to MIT (=eventually leaving town) when she just keeps on digging deeper into this town's secrets when she knows people have been killed for less. She's never going anywhere and frankly that's just depressing, especially since she can't see it.3. This book is about teenagers, I get that. Teenagers just aren't going to have much say in the rules. It just gets really old watching everything happen TO them. If you think about the grand scheme of the story they really aren't the people you want to hear more about.Book plot consists of: have a nice happy dinner together = Claire and/or Eve to Michael and/or Shane \"You can't tell me what to do!\" = C&E either get locked in a room or leave and get caught (repeat 3 or 4 times) = vampire comes along makes big appearance and they live to see another dinner of chili or tacos.GETS OLD!

Claire and her roommates now not only have the vampires to deal with in Morganville but Shane's father has shown up with his bikers buddies. So far I'm finding this series just rather average. Sometimes I enjoy what's going on but at other times I find Claire to be rather annoying and some of the choices made to be laughable. I'm still kind of comparing this to some of the rather campy horror movies that are usually more for a laugh but that's not necessarily a bad thing either. Not really a bad read but room for improvement still. Hoping that Claire will mature a bit in the upcoming books.

It was full of emotions throughout the whole book. Claire's decision at the book's end is heartbreaking, but so in character for her. This book was so much better than the last one. Not to disappointed as of yet, and I am not going on a rambling tyrant reveling any details as I did with Glass House. Sorry you will have to read and enjoy for yourself.My absolute favorite and will read again and again. I strongly recommend! It has outstanding qualities. The characters are wonderful and surprising and multi-dimensional. The writing is luring, engaging, and well-crafted enough to keep me interested from cover to cover and beyond. The plot is astonishing with twists and turns weaved into a well thought and planned story. There\u2019s no pretense and romance was well balanced and done entirely correctly with properly distributed amounts of hints, behaviors and incredible, undeniable chemistry.

By now, we've learned a bit more about all the inhabitants of the Glass House, where Claire is currently living off-campus while attending Texas Prarie University. Her roommates\u2014Eve the Goth girl, sexy hunk Shane, and mysterious Michael\u2014have been having to fight off the vampires that rule Morganville because situations beyond their control have really pissed some of them off. It certainly doesn't help when Shane's vampire-hunting father comes to town either, with a plan to take care of all the vampires of Morganville once and for all.If I hadn't read the first book so recently I think I may have been lost for the first several pages as this book picks up mid-scene from the events of book one, with very little reminder cues. I really don't like when authors do this, particularly since these books are published several months apart and most people aren't going to read them right after another, but instead would read a number of other books in betweeen. Therefore, with this particular series, you might be better served picking up the first two or three books and then reading them all in one go.In comparison to the other young adult urban (paranormal) fantasy books I've been reading, specifically the House of Night Novels by P.C. Cast, these seem a bit slower paced and not nearly as exciting. I remember thinking something similar about the first book of Ms. Caine's Weather Warden series, Ill Wind, when I read that. Certainly an interesting enough story, but it didn't have that wow factor for me that makes it a favorite. *shrug*That said, the story is still interesting enough to keep going, and does pick up the pace more as things progress. Though written in the third person, you really only see into Claire's head most of the time, not any of the other main characters, so the inclusion of a few excerpts from Eve's diary at the end of the book is a welcome addition which lets you learn a bit more about what makes her tick. I certainly plan to keep up with future books in this series, and already have Midnight Alley, the third in the series, waiting on my bookshelf. I'll just have to remember to read it sooner rather than later for the reasons stated above since I'll be passing this second book along and won't have it to refer back to."}, {"userName": "Cam Garza", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10664604-cam-garza", "userReview": "Complete waste of my time.

I can deal with Claire's crying, but I cannot deal with stupidity. She was supposed to be the smart one, wasn't she?

The story plot just flows from book to book and I'm thankful for that. Everything actually connects without a huge unknown year taking place in between. I love Claire and all, but she's got to get some fire in her stomach. Yeah sure she feels revenge for Monica, but it just doesn't seem enough to me. Maybe I'm just a too violent person. When Rachel Caine decided to turn michael into a vampire in this book, I agreed because he was in limbo for a while there. Okay, so I hate werewolves, so I guess I would be devistated if my friend turned into one. But if it was because of my urging that he was useless otherwise, I wouldn't be so mad if he made the final decision... I am a little frustrated on Shane's character being so... unforgiving.

The story picked up right where the first book left of and continued to be fast paced and entertaining the entire way through. The characters continue to be the same great personalities they were from the first book, and I really liked Sam. I feel like he may be the first vampire we\u2019ve met who could be as close to good as vampires in this series can get. I really like the character of Amelie, although I wonder exactly what her intentions are and just how far she\u2019ll go to get what she wants. Who and what would she be willing to risk in order to protect herself? Personally I think both Claire and Shane along with Eve and Michael are great couples. One of the things that struck me about this series straight away, is how there doesn\u2019t appear to be any love triangles. Honestly, I\u2019ve become sick of them and seeing two fresh couples who are all close and get along together without any extra issues is excellent. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air and I hope it stays that way. I don\u2019t want to see anyone pop up in the story that could be a threat to either romance. I like that Claire continues to grow and appears to becoming stronger. It\u2019s wonderful when the main character continues to evolve over the course of the series. I find that she\u2019s very mature for her age too. Often during the book, I found myself forgetting that she is almost two years younger than her housemates. She\u2019s very level and balanced that it\u2019s hard to think of her as a child. I find it very difficult to define Shane after this book. He\u2019s not exactly a bad-boy, although he has that hint of rebelliousness that makes him fun and he\u2019s not outright innocent or sweet either. After learning of his father, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s done a number on Shane over the years and that in a lot of ways Shane is vulnerable when it comes to his dad. He\u2019s the only family Shane has left and while doesn\u2019t completely agree or disagree with his father\u2019s beliefs on vampires; Shane can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s a part of that world. Or was. At the end of the book Shane made it obvious how little he wanted to do with his father, but I wonder how long that will last. I thought it was very interesting to see Michael become a vampire. If there is anyone who can become one of the unread and yet manage to hold on to his humanity and still be himself, it\u2019s him. Also I wonder how Eve\u2019s brother Jason is going to affect the storyline. Is he really the one killing those girls? And will he be in the next book? I\u2019m looking forward to finding out.

I think the characters and plot development hit the right spots. We get to know more about everyone, and with the books being so small that is an issue. There's a limited time to developed characters and the world, while trying to squeeze in the plots! Dead Girls' Dance does a better job of it. Though my real issues where how Claire handled the situations. Despite Monica, the mean (psycho) girl, trying to kill her in the last book Claire just kind of shrugs it off. I don't understand. Not to mention that rape was used as a plot device to get readers blood going. Then it wasn't handled well. Those boys should have been reported properly. I wanted to see it. Not just threatened by a vampire. Not to mention that things just happen. Claire and company don't think things through. It worked out better here. But it still annoyed me. Yes things just happen and you have no control. In the end this book finally got me connecting to the characters. It reminded me why I loved them so much. All of the little nuances I'm picking up are a fun look back for moments I still remember happening in the later books. Not to mention that I love Shane, Eve, Claire, and Michael. They are a fun group to be around. Lots happens, but at least the cliffhanger isn't so cruel! The entire book is a rush and I'm looking forward to the next one.

The romantic aspect was also nicely done, as was the introduction of Sam. However, the villains were rather flat--perhaps to underscore that Claire is discovering that humans can be as bad as the vampires--so the sense of brooding menace from the first book was missing.

When the story kicks off, it doesn\u2019t waste any time picking right up where it left off and taking you on a turbo ride of adventure. The events keep happening one right after the other, and the story does not slow down to take a breath, which I loved. In this book, the cliffhanger from the previous novel is resolved rather quickly, and we learn about new challenges faced by the inhabitants of the Glass House.I love how Rachel Caine slowly reveals her vampire lore and back story as the facts become pertinent to the plot. The main characters have perfect chemistry; and the friendship and bond between Claire, Eve, Michael and Shane really hooks the reader where you can\u2019t help but fall for them. In this book, they are faced with some dangerous situations, but their loyalty for each other never wavers, as they risk their lives to keep each other safe. By the end of the novel, Claire is faced with a difficult choice, where she must decide how much she is willing to sacrifice to save her friends and the people she cares for.Overall, I\u2019m hooked on this series, as it delivers the right blend of adventure, intrigue, and angst to keep me turning the pages well into the night. There is one bone of contention I must mention, but it\u2019s really no biggie\u2026 but here it is\u2026 I think the author has made Claire\u2019s youth quite clear, repeated mention makes it redundant and no longer relevant to this story because Claire has proven time and again she can handle herself in dangerous situations no matter how bad the beating.

In fact, it seems this was Shane's reason to return to Morganville anyway \u2013 to gather as much intelligence as possible in the eventual attack.Shane's father instantly launches a path of destruction, killing vampires wherever he can. Worse, he has no concern for collateral damage and his gang does not hesitate to kill humans who look like vampires \u2013 even resorting to kidnapping humans to follow their plans.And worse still, Shane is quickly implicated in the killings. The penalty for vampire slaying in Morganville is being burned alive. Claire, Michael and Eve must find a way to convince the vampire authorities that Shane is not guilty and they should spare his life.Like the first book, one of the biggest barriers I found to enjoyment was the utter foolishness of the characters, especially Claire. See a dark and shadowy alley that 3 people have now told her not to go down and what does she do? Why down she goes.Read More"}, {"userName": "LegallyBarb", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2240635-legallybarb", "userReview": "I have to reiterate how much I enjoy this author's youthful style of writing - when she writes what these young people are thinking/saying, it feels very authentic. In addition, they are funny! I often find myself chuckling at various wise cracks in this series! While it took a little while to figure out exactly where this series was going after the first book, the author did a good job of creating new drama without invalidating the first book and without feeling like she was over reaching or forcing a series. The progression of the story felt natural, the main characters remain lovable and the various antagonists (which come in all levels of severity) are all quite complex. There are still those moments comparable to a dumb blond backing into a dark room while looking around fearfully for the crazy guy who just attacked her (except for into the room she is backing into!), and you want to yell \"don't be so stupid!!!\" But where would be the suspense if every character always followed the \"safe\" way??? Ultimately, this is great story-telling, coupled with talented writing - it was a real page-turner and I wasted no time hopping right into book 3. Again, I cannot emphasize enough NOT to skip the \"sneak peak\" into book 3 at the end of book 2 - the author uses this to shed more light on and add new insight into book 2, while also indicating the direction of book 3 - only the last paragraph is truly about book 3, although the rest provides \"background\" information helpful to the next book."}, {"userName": "Barbara \u2605", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1968285-barbara", "userReview": "Shane's father, Frank, the vampire killer, came to town and started some major shit. Shane is caught in the middle and arrested. When Frank abducts Monica Morrell, Claire's mortal enemy, a mexican standoff ensues.

I love Shane and Claire's relationship and I love watching it progress throughout the books. I just am bothered by how much Claire gets hurt. It happens almost every page and that bothers me for some reason. She acts completely helpless. Nonetheless, I am excited for the next book!!
