This was\u2026not what I expected from Maeve Binchy\u2019s debut novel. I have read and enjoyed many Maeve Binchy\u2019s works before this (I just counted - looks like I\u2019ve read 15!), and I enjoyed most of this one, but was slightly disappointed by the ending. It felt like a rather more dark work than I was anticipating. It was quite long - over 800 pages - but an easy read, chronicling the lives of 2 young girls as they grow up together during the war, turn into young women on opposite sides of the Irish Sea, while continuing their friendship, knowing that they can always count on the other, if needed.I loved the story, parts of which were heartbreaking, and while I can see how the ending could have happened, I didn\u2019t like it (and I can\u2019t explain why, without giving everything away) and I didn\u2019t like the writing style about 30 pages from the end. It became choppy, and was obviously intentional, in 2 - 3 sentence bursts of action at a time, before moving the spotlight on to the next character\u2019s piece of action.I was tempted to drop my rating, but left it at 4 stars, because even though I didn\u2019t like the ending, I suppose it was well done, and my dislike is purely personal bias."}, {"userName": "Marina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75392432-marina", "userReview": "[ a murder does occur.

I don't pick up any of her novels with the intent of exploring some deep philosophical or cultural questions. Instead, I approach each of her novels as an imaginary journey, a very long movie that plays out through words. The characters she creates in all of her novels are both realistic and engaging and Light a Penny Candle is no exception. Once again, I found myself breezing through the pages, so desperate to find out what happened next to Elizabeth, Aisling and the rest (yes, even Johnny Stone...) only to find myself equally as reluctant to turn that last page and see their stories end. But that's the thing, their stories don't really end. It felt almost as if Binchy had recognized that she needed to end the novel at some point or else she could have gone on forever, following all of the remaining characters throughout the rest of their lives. And I think it is this impulse, the idea that I truly can imagine a whole new set of encounters and exchanges between these characters, that draws me to Binchy as an author. No, Light a Penny Candle does not provide much in the way of heavy discussion, but as far as pure entertainment, I think Binchy is miles ahead of most others. My rating (5 out of 5) may be biased, and possibly influenced by her recent passing, but I think this novel holds its own in her collection against some of my favorites (Circle of Friends, Echoes and Tara Road). If you're looking for some quality escapist literature, I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7374796-carol", "userReview": "I know all kinds of women who read Maeve Binchy. Friends and relatives all like her.Why?I think its partly because she writes so well about the Irish. She has a knack for showing what Irish Catholics do, believe in, think about etc. \u201cLight a Penny Candle\u201d begins in the 1940's and ends in 1959. It tells of a very different era from our own. Now we counsel women to leave their alcoholic and violent husbands; then, Irish Catholic mothers told their daughters that it was their duty to stay with such men because of the sanctity of marriage! I read this novel pretty quickly and so did my mother, who started it and left all her other books behind to focus on it. The pacing is good, though the beginning and end are a bit slow.My main criticism of the novel is its ending. I won\u2019t spoil it by revealing too much, but I feel that certain characters changed unexpectedly and unbelievably. Binchy didn\u2019t prepare her reader for an ending that seemed rushed or contrived.Is \u201cLight a Penny Candle\u201d fluffy romance for women? I don\u2019t think so. The novel tells us so a lot about Irish customs and ways, and it gives us a glimpse of England during WW2 .I\u2019ll have to read more of her to see what her (many) later novels become. She\u2019s written lots and lots of books, which makes me wonder if she slides into more formulaic writing.I\u2019ll have to see!"}, {"userName": "Nicholas During", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/440220-nicholas-during", "userReview": "I was pretty disappointed in this book overall. It starts off well, and I was at first enjoying it a lot. But though the writing has energy and drive, the themes never are really given their due, the characters are introduced and barely slip out of a form character for the rest of the novel (which is meant to be 20 years of their lives), there isn't really any consequences to their actions, and I felt like the whole things was a bit shallow. But rather than being totally negative I'll note the two things I did like: Elizabeth White as a child was stronger. Mostly because we were able to see her adapt to a new country, family, and culture and see her change there\u2014which doesn't happen at all in the rest of the novel, and when Eileen changes her mind about her daughter's separation from her husband it doesn't seem anyone cares anyway. And the relationship between the strong independent woman when Aisling moves to London. Though I totally saw Aisling and Johnny's relationship coming, I did like that she has Aisling ending the book as single, childless, but content and willing to duke it out in the tough streets on London rather than returning to her familial Irish tough. But otherwise the book fell flat for me. And in particular the male characters. Only the Irish men has something there. Johnny, meant to be so seductive, is just boring and juvenile. Didn't do it for me."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116519-ann", "userReview": "I found this a very slow read and terribly predictable. All the characters were one-dimensional, either very good or very bad. And there wasn't a single likable male character.

This is the first Maeve Binchy book I've read where I finished it and felt rather unsatisfied. I have become accustomed to (and a fan of) the way she spins a tale, weaves together the details, and above all exercises the patience to do the story justice. However, the wheels seemed to come off the story, so to speak, in the middle of the final chapter. It felt like she got tired of writing it and wasn't sure how to wrap it up. The accelerated pace of the latter half of Chapter 16 was bumpy and out of step from the rest of the book. The ending was disorienting and abrupt. I didn't think it was the end, to be honest - listening to the audiobook, I thought the audio file was corrupted. I still recommend the story itself - I loved the friendship between Aisling and Elizabeth, and the love of Aisling's mother Eileen.

Het boek is iets minder vrolijk dan haar andere. Nu zat ik zelf ook in een wat minder vrolijke periode vanwege een overlijden. Dus wellicht paste het boek daarom wel bij mijn stemming. Het verhaal draait om Elizabeth. Je volgt haar leven, dat begint als een jong meisje dat vanwege de Tweede Wereldoorlog naar een gezin in Ierland wordt gestuurd. Zij hebben een dochter van Elizabeths leeftijd, Aisling. De meisjes raken bevriend en ook als ze volwassen zijn houden ze contact. Een deel van het verhaal wordt ook vanuit Aislings oogpunt beschreven. Je volgt hun leven met steeds wat tussensprongen in jaren. Het is geen gemakkelijke tijd voor jonge vrouwen. In Ierland heeft het katholieke geloof ook nog veel invloed over wat een vrouw moet en niet moet. Maar zelfs in Londen, waar Elizabeth woont, gaat men er toch vanuit dat een vrouw zal trouwen en thuis blijft om voor de kinderen te zorgen. Ik vind dat Maeve Binchy die onderwerpen goed beschreven heeft. Het boek laat ook de mindere kanten van het leven zien. Daardoor is het niet altijd even vrolijk. Maar dat is het echte leven ook niet. Een verschil met haar andere boeken vind ik dat ze daar toch een optimistische toon weet te behouden. Dat is bij dit boek niet altijd het geval. Ook komen de eindes bij haar latere boeken wat minder uit de lucht vallen. Maar dat zal er ook mee te maken hebben dat ze toen al meer ervaring had als schrijfster. Ondanks dat vind ik dat dit je verhaal je wel meezuigt in de levens van Elizabeth en Aisling. Het leest ook vlot en op sommige momenten had ik moeite om het weg te leggen. Toch zou ik dit boek niet aan iedereen aanraden. Als je Maeve Binchy's boeken niet kent, zou ik met een van haar latere beginnen."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1734970-diana", "userReview": "It's 1940s & Hitler is planning his war on England. To protect their 10 year old daughter Elizabeth, George White and his wife send her to Kilgarret, Ireland. Taken in by her mother's old school friend, Eileen O'Connor, & her husband Sean, Elizabeth quickly becomes inseparable from their vivacious daughter Aisling. It is Aisling who teaches Elizabeth to have faith in life and convinces her that if you light a penny candle at church, your most sacred wish will come true. Five years later, Elizabeth returns home armed with a new sense of independence and love of life. Against her parents' wishes, she pursues a career in art and embarks on a no-strings-attached love affair that threatens to break her heart. Meanwhile, Aisling remains in Kilgarret, yearning for a larger world, a world more like Elizabeth's. Passionately courted by the son of Kilgarret's wealthiest families, she struggles to convince herself tht he could make her happy. From the moment they meet to the moment two decades later when they know they both love the same elusive, irrestible man, their lives are inextricably linked. Two women caought between the past and the future, theirs is a world swept up in change...a world where old ways no longer work and new ways demand daring...a world where in times of trouble, it is no longer enough to Light a Penny Candle."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6147238-cheryl", "userReview": "The first time I read a Bnchy novel, I was like, \u201cIs this her best novel yet?\u201d Oh, right. This is just one out of many. Reading another of her novel has not ruined my expectations of finding her words as moving and her characters as lively and real as those in the first I\u2019ve read.Really, it\u2019s like, the people in the novel are not mere icons of fiction but they actually seem like you\u2019re personally hearing their conversations. Every word the characters say is breaking my heart for the innate geniuses they have in them. It\u2019s nice to see that these people are really trying to make something worthy out of their lives and Binchy never failed to make each of her characters have that overwhelming sense of strong and motivated personalities. Another thing why I love the novel so much is because of the tranquil environment amidst the bustling to-and-fro of mobs in a big city. You can still see a sense of peace although war is evidently going on. It\u2019s like, when everything goes wrong, you still have a home to go to. The novel even proves more than just that.Generally, the novel is one masterpiece any genteel traveler would love to carry along whilst in a pleasant holiday trip.

She hasn't found her own voice at all, and I kept thinking I was reading a Rosamunde Pilcher novel instead. Not that there's anything wrong with RP, I just missed the charm of Maeve Binchy's later books.The thing I love about Maeve Binchy's books is that they're generally speaking comfort reads. There are exceptions of course, but as a rule people tend to be in a better place at the end of the book than they were at the beginning. That is not the case with this book, and that - more than anything else - made me give it just 2 stars. It's the account of ~20 years of Elizabeth and Aisling's lives, and offers no resolution or has no real end... in fact, I was pretty shocked to see it end where it did. There seemed no rhyme or reason for it.

The writing isn't particularly profound and her plots tend to veer toward extreme soap opera-iness. However, each and every one of her characters are so well-developed and so HUMAN that I can't help but be drawn to each of them. Furthermore, MB has the knack of richly portraying Ireland and her people...their speech, mannerisms, customs, humor, pathos...everything. For me, it's a real treat to read one of MB's novels because it takes me somewhere so unspeakably foreign yet, as so many reviewers have touted, makes me feel like I've come home.

Maeve Binchy...Ireland's own Jodi Picoult!If you prefer to not think too hard while reading; if you are amused by all things Irish; or if you've never experienced the Binchy formula, then you would probably enjoy any number of her books. Binchy, like Picoult, is best enjoyed in isolation of any of her other writings. I believe this is one of her better books, but I am probably influenced by the fact that it was the first of hers that I read. It chronicles a couple of decades of friendship between an Irish woman and an English woman through the trials and tribulations of their lives.

It was the first adult book I ever read, and it really helped shape my reading (and writing) interests. Reading it again, as a young adult in her early 20s, was a differently rewarding experience. I love the characters and the way the story progresses through time, told primarily though two POVs. For the most part, the story and the characters were very consistent. This wavered a bit in Part Four, which was told at a much faster pace than the rest of the novel--a sort of highlights reel or bulleted list of events. Things sort of spin out of control, and they aren't really explained or wrapped up. Part of me appreciates the open ending, as that mirrors life and suggests that their lives carry on. However, Elizabeth's actions at the end of the novel need closure. I feel like I need some direction for what I can expect she and Aisling will do next.And a quick aside for Aisling, but really for Maeve Binchy and her editors, because this seemed more like an editorial oversight than a character one (SPOILER ALERT)Johnny was going to go to Greece whether you went or not; that is why you felt like he would.

It's set mainly in the 1950s, but doesn't really delve into the war. Instead it focuses on the friendship of two girls growing up in Ireland and London and also examines their family relationships.
