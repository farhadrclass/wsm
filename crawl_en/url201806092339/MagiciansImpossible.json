I am pointing this out because I feel like there are still some revisions to be made, and the content I am reviewing is subject to change prior to release.I do feel like there could be a four star read in here after some tweaking. The world building was pretty awesome. I loved the idea of the Citadel, the place that exists separate from the \"mundane\" or non-magical world. I loved Ingress, the hall of infinite doors that can connect a person to any place in the world. I liked how the explanation for magic use in the mundane world was explained by balance, and the hierarchy of mages was described, each with abilities that added on to the previous class.I also enjoyed the characters. I loved that they all came from different backgrounds/countries and that we were given their backstories. Teo and Kel were wise cracking kids that made me smile in every scene they were in. Allegra was a tough as nails character with a fierce loyalty to her mentor. Jason was okay as far as heroes go, but compared to the myriad of other characters he seemed sort of average. My main critique of this book is the plot. I felt like I had no idea what was going on most of the time. I still don't know which side is good and which side is bad. In Magician's Impossible, there are two factions: The Invisible Hand which stands for Order, and the Golden Dawn which stands for chaos. The Invisible Hand is comprised of actual mages, while the Golden Dawn is comprised of wizards, (non-magical humans who cast spells). I don't understand why anyone was chasing the Sphere of Destiny or what it's ultimate purpose was.I don't want to spoil anything because each development/twist in the plot was what drove the book on, but I still have no idea which of the above mentioned factions is good and which is bad. I mean, I have an idea of which is which, but I don't know WHY the good faction is the good one and the bad one is the bad one. I don't know why the book ended the way it did. The last few chapters of the book were all very exciting in terms of action, but it was overshadowed by the fact that I had no idea why any of it was happening. I never understood the end game in this book, the conclusion it was working toward.I'm a person who really needs to know the why. I like things to make sense and be justified. I think readers who are okay with gray area and ambiguity will really love this book. Both factions have their good points and their bad points I guess. Maybe it was left ambiguous on purpose. Maybe it just needs some revisions like I stated above.I did enjoy some of the plot, as it kept me guessing. There was one plot \"twist\" that was really obvious and I saw coming right from the opening of the novel, but there were many others that I didn't see. They were a lot of fun to read, they were all cohesive and they all made sense.Ultimately, I'm still on the fence about this one. I really wanted to love it. I loved the magic and the world building was solid, but I also read through the entire second half feeling like I was missing something. I would be interested to see if any of this ambiguity is tied up before the release or in future books."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "I was going to go with a 3.5 star rating for this book, but I talked my way up to 4 stars, as I thought about it more. I believe that my rating indecision is based on the fact that I was disappointed with some aspects, and I felt that it was different from what the name implies. I was expecting more of a caper type book with a magical ensemble. It's actually about a young man who finds out that he is part of a magical world he had no idea existed, and how his father kept him out of this world to keep him safe. Now that the scales have fallen from his eyes, he is under threat and must learn to master the powers that he inherited from his father, and uncover secrets about the mother he never knew.The Good:*Very creative magical system and world-building. Magic is introduced as something that feels solid and foundational, with checks and balances, and the fact that most humans are unaware of it happening has a believable explanation.*The lead character feels like an everyday late twenties man, but he felt like something was missing. It makes sense for his history but also resonates with readers who are experiencing some of that same confusion about what adulting means nowadays. *Some stellar action sequences that seemed very cinematic.*Ruthless bad guys and characters whose alignments kept me guessing.*Thoughtful twists and turns in the storylineThe Not-So-Good:*It was hard to keep up with what was going on at times. The story seems to jump from one scenes to others with very sharp edits.*Many characters weren't that likable. I mostly liked the lead character, but most of the others, not so much.*Very high body count. I think that a death in a book should matter. In life, people die so often that it makes me want fiction that is very thoughtful about when and how a character dies.*As I mentioned earlier, I was expecting something very different than what this story delivers. I would still like my magical caper urban fantasy ensemble book. I hope someone somewhere is writing it for me. Overall, this was enjoyable and it drew me in. The idea was very interesting and the author has a way of writing imagery in a way that stimulates vivid mental pictures. I could see this as a very good movie one day. I would read more books in this series."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "3.5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2017/10/01/...Brad Abraham\u2019s Magicians Impossible is a fascinating debut that blends together many genres, reading much like a magic school story for adults wrapped in a part-urban fantasy, part-spy thriller package. The novel stars protagonist Jason Bishop, a 30-year-old bartender from small town New York who has always felt deep in his heart that he was meant for bigger things. For many, such desires are nothing more than a pipe dream, but unbeknownst to Jason, the potential in him has always been in his blood.Shortly after the apparent suicide of his estranged father Daniel, Jason discovers that he is actually the son of two very power magicians. Daniel, whose real name was actually Damon King, was a secret agent for the Invisible Hand, a secret coven of mages involved in an ancient war against another shadowy society of magic users called the Golden Dawn. After Jason was born, Damon had concocted a cover story so that the boy would never suspect his parents\u2019 true identities, and then he distanced himself, becoming an aloof and absent father in order to keep his son hidden from his enemies.As a result, Jason grew up harboring a deep resentment for Damon, knowing nothing about his family\u2019s origins. The existence of a magical secret world was a shock to him, when at his father\u2019s funeral, a mysterious stranger representing the Invisible Hand named Carter Block appeared before him and revealed everything about their order. Carter also told Jason the heartbreaking truth: Damon King did not really commit suicide\u2014he was murdered. Now the Invisible Hand needs Jason on their side to strike back against the Golden Dawn and to complete the work his father started, hunting down a powerful artifact that could help turn the tide of this magical war. But first, to prepare him for the battles ahead, Jason will have to undergo and complete his secret agent mage training\u2014and he\u2019s got a lot of catching up to do.From the start, I was impressed with the presentation of Magicians Impossible and was struck by how incredibly cinematic it was. If you\u2019ve ever wished for more action in your urban fantasy, then this is the book for you. Hints of what to expect are in the title\u2019s reference, which practically screams the kind of dynamic excitement and edge-of-your-seat thrills typically found in Mission Impossible or James Bond movies. In keeping with the comparisons to Hollywood blockbusters, however, one should not expect to go in finding anything too original in the novel\u2019s plot either, though to Brad Abraham\u2019s credit, he does a good job casting his own brand of magic on familiar ideas by combining them with other elements or sprucing them up with new and wild twists.The flow of the novel is also relentlessly driven and fun, though like many debuts, the pacing does encounter unevenness in some places. Many new authors tend to become too enthusiastic with their first novels, biting off more than they can chew by trying to do too much, and I sense a mild case of that here. Things start to drag as we move into the second half of the book, following Jason as he is inducted into the Invisible Hand. This section was weighed down by too much exposition into the smaller details while not providing enough of the background information needed to understand the bigger picture, leaving me a bit confused as to ultimate purpose of these magical societies and their much flaunted all-important war. Abraham\u2019s ideas are certainly ambitious, but perhaps his attention was spread too thin trying to juggle them all at once.That said though, if you were drawn to this book by the promise of explosive action and riveting spycraft, I seriously doubt any of these issues will bother you. The flaws are also relatively trivial in the greater scheme of things, especially in a novel like Magicians Impossible which makes no bones about its prime objective\u2014to entertain the reader above all else. While the plot might not be all that extravagant and the twists might be on the predictable side, these weaknesses are offset by the delectable fantasy elements, family drama, magical espionage, adrenaline-pumping fight sequences, and globetrotting adventure. I had a good time with this novel and hopefully Brad Abraham has plans for a sequel in the works, because I wouldn\u2019t mind a chance to return to this world."}, {"userName": "Lisa Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/620490-lisa-maxwell", "userReview": "This hard-boiled thriller was a blast to read. It's like if Harry Potter had discovered he was a wizard at 30 and had to become an Auror, like, NOW. Fast-paced, twisty, and with an imaginative magic system that constantly had me impressed with its inventiveness, I loved it start to finish."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9595345-lisa", "userReview": "Review from Tenacious Reader: http://www.tenaciousreader.com/2017/0...3.5/5 StarsMagicians Impossible is a fun and exciting adventure that introduces magic to our world. I think this book should do well with readers that are fans of The Magicians by Lev Grossman. It features an older protagonist than a typical coming into powers or magic school book, and with just one or two exceptions, he has been a loner for most of his life. After the death of his estranged father, Jason\u2019s world turns upside down and he finds himself part of something quite unexpected.I liked Jason\u2019s character. He definitely has some flaws and has managed to create very few personal connections in his life, particularly for someone that seems likable. He is resentful of his absentee father (who just died), and through some flashbacks, we can see some of his disappointments as a child. He grew up believing magic was just simple slight of hand as opposed to actual magic.After the death of his father, he learns there is such a thing as real magic as well as about the communities that are a part of that previously invisible and unknown part of the world. The Invisible Hand is a training institute that turns those found to have mage potential into magician spies. Instead of just a normal, boring Hogwarts type of academy that teaches young magically inclined individuals how to use their powers for good, or what not, The Invisible Hand teaches them how to use their skill to deceive and battle. It is definitely a fun twist and while reading I was wondered why it haven\u2019t read a book like this before.In addition to the The Invisible Hand, Jason also learns of a rival magical group, and as the two factions war with each other, Jason finds himself in the middle. He has to determine which side is honest, or at least who he should place the most trust in. Which is hard when he finds himself basically as a pawn each side is trying to maneuver.I will say this is a fun action filled read. I also have to confess that for me, that\u2019s just about all it was. There is nothing wrong with that, popcorn thrillers are fun for a reason, and this one fits that bill, but for readers that might want to delve a bit deeper, they may find themselves a little disappointed. It\u2019s just a matter of setting expectations for what the book is: a really fun, fast paced book with some cool ideas. To expand some of the other areas, you will likely lose the fast pace that makes it fun. My largest concern with this aspect of the book is that since its so action and pace oriented, I found some solutions to be a bit \u2026 easy. Jason is definitely a character who has a quick rise in his abilities and sometimes it just felt like an convenient out. But that\u2019s only the case if you stop to think about it. If you can read and just enjoy the ride without worrying so much about how or why it goes where it goes, well, then I think this is a minor enough element that you\u2019ll find a really enjoyable read.My only other observation with this book may sound a little silly. There is one setting that, as much as I tried not to, I just kept picturing Monsters, Inc. There is a place that is filled with doors that act as portals to places around the world, and I can\u2019t help it, every I encountered that setting in the book, I pictured an animated Sully and the little girl with pigtails. Probably not at all what the author was going for. I would have preferred to not think of Monsters, Inc while reading this, but the concept is important to this book, and I guess I just have a very strong association of doors like that to Monsters, Inc. Ooops? Not really a fault of the book by any means, but there just didn\u2019t seem to be enough details or description of the place to overpower my reaction.Anyway, I would definitely recommend the book if you are in the mood for a fast paced thriller with spies and a magical warring underground community. It is a fun and fast read and I really enjoyed the slightly different type of magic school, with the added conspiracy twist thrown in as well."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6755739-mark", "userReview": "This is a book I bought due to the continued absence of a certain Harry Dresden and looked promising with a title that referred to a bland between Mission Impossible and some great magic adventures.However the book never lived up to its promise and a kinda found better books to read and left this one behind in the wake of far better books.The story left me kinda not interested and bored, not a great quality when one reads a book.

The best way I can describe it is Harry Potter and Harry Dresden meets James Bond, and that's enough to hook me right there. The opening scene of the story is really cool, but fair warning it's pretty bloody. The main part of the book follows Jason as his life takes a dramatic turn. After his father's death, he learns that his father was a mage, an evil group of wizards is after him, and that he needs to develop his natural (if latent) magical talent if he wants to stay alive. My favorite scenes of this book are definitely those training scenes where the mages at the Citadel, a location that's hidden from normal people for mages to train and possibly live safely, as we get to see what type of magic he specializes in. My favorite character was definitely the mage named Allegra. I really wish we got to see a little more of her, but her interactions with Jason are great. This novel also deals with the chose one trope, Jason thinks that's what he is and while Allegra assures him that he isn't, he kind of actually is a special snowflake. Not my favorite way it could have been handled, but it was still fun getting there. My other issue was with the two factions - The Invisible Hand, the good side, and The Golden Dawn, the evil - I couldn't quite figure out their differences and what their ultimate goals were regarding the Sphere. Even though I had some issues with this story, I still had a lot of fun listening to this fast-paced, action-packed, and well produced audiobook."}, {"userName": "Maryam", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53037-maryam", "userReview": "Actual rating : 3.5Review to come!"}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3118961-tammy", "userReview": "The nitty-gritty: Fast and furious, violent and action-packed, this story will make you wish \n  you \nhad magical powers!Brad Abraham\u2019s debut is being billed as \u201c\n  Harry Potter\n meets James Bond\u201d and after reading \nMagicians Impossible\n I have to say that\u2019s a pretty good description. I had several \n  Harry Potter\n flashback moments while reading this, and I could almost hear the James Bond theme song playing in the background during some of the more thrilling action scenes. Abraham\u2019s debut is fast-paced, and if you love stories about warring factions in the magical world, then you will really enjoy this book. Jason Bishop is your average thirty-year-old. His year-long relationship with his girlfriend Winnie is starting to show cracks, but he\u2019s mostly happy--except for that nagging feeling he\u2019s always had that he\u2019s destined for something much bigger than his small, ordinary life. He just doesn\u2019t know what that is. Jason has escaped his childhood hometown of Cold Spring, but when his estranged father suddenly commits suicide, Jason finds himself back there for the funeral. Trying to imagine his father jumping off a highrise is hard enough, but a run-in after the funeral with a strange man named Carter Block changes Jason\u2019s life in a flash. Carter belongs to a group of magicians known as the Invisible Hand, and he\u2019s come to deliver the news that Jason is in danger from a rival group of magicians known as the Golden Dawn. Before you can say \u201cAbracadabra,\u201d Jason is literally running for his life, swept up in a hidden world of magic and mages. \u00a0He finds himself in a strange fortress called the Citadel, where mages of all levels live and train, readying themselves for the ultimate showdown with the Golden Dawn.As Jason\u2019s powers grow, he makes some startling discoveries about his past--specifically his absentee father Dan who he\u2019s resented his entire life. And when the Invisible Hand gets wind of a powerful magical artifact, it\u2019s up to Jason to lead his new friends on a quest to find it, before the Golden Dawn can claim it for their own.From the exciting and shockingly violent opening chapter, Abraham gives us a world where magic is real but is hidden from the \u201cmundanes.\u201d I really enjoyed the world-building, especially when Jason moves into the Citadel, an immense structure that seems to exist out of time, and contains not only a training school-like setting, but a hallway filled with thousands of doors, each one leading to a different place. It created an interesting (although maybe \n  too \nconvenient) way for mages to quickly get from one place to another. I also liked the different powers that mages wield. I won\u2019t go into all the details here, but each level of magic has a particular skill set, and mages can do anything from manipulating objects through space to even flying. One of my favorite details in the story was that Jason adopts his weapon of choice from his father: a deck of playing cards that become lethal in his hands.I didn\u2019t really connect with \n  all \nthe characters, but there was one in particular who quickly became my favorite, and I wouldn\u2019t mind an entire story that revolved around her. Allegra is a mage with a terribly sad back-story, and I loved every scene she was in. I think the fact that the author gave her so much rich history is the reason I loved her character, and I wish there had been more like Allegra.I\u2019ll admit I almost gave this book a three-and-a half star rating, but Jason\u2019s emotional journey pushed it up to four stars. Abraham does a great job of delving into Jason\u2019s past and tying together one particular event that not only explains why he\u2019s a Mage, but creates a strong emotional connection to his father. I\u2019m always looking for characters with layers, and despite some of Jason\u2019s less than appealing traits, these flashbacks added a great deal to his character.Although I had a great time with \nMagicians Impossible\n, it wasn\u2019t a perfect book, and it definitely has the feel of a debut. Abraham\u2019s writing is a little rough around the edges in places, and could have used a bit more editing in my opinion. I also found the story confusing at times, especially the relationship between the Invisible Hand and the Golden Dawn. \nMagicians Impossible\n is one of those stories where the characters pretend to be one thing but end up as something else entirely, and the almost constant shifting from good to bad and back again made my head spin.My other issue had to do with the ease of Jason\u2019s introduction into the hidden world of magic. Ironically, Jason himself says something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m definitely not a special snowflake,\u201d but then Abraham proceeds to make him just that. Amazingly, Jason climbs the ladder of types of magicians with dizzying speed, proving that he is indeed an ultra special mage, the likes of which no one has seen before. Within minutes of entering the Citadel and beginning his training, he\u2019s mastered the first few levels of magic and stunned his instructors. I can only think that the author did this to hurry things along, because there is actually a lot going on in this story, and he clearly wanted to get past the basics and into the main action. This is a \n  big \nstory, and the page count almost felt too small to contain it.But despite those issues, I had a blast with this book. I read the last page with a grin on my face, and I can't help but wonder what Brad Abraham will think of next.Big thanks to the publisher for supplying a review copy.This review originally appeared on Books, Bones & Buffy"}, {"userName": "Verushka", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23271825-verushka", "userReview": "What is this about: Jason Bishop discovers he has magic in the worst circumstances ever. And then just when he didn't think things could get worse, they kind of sort of do. But there's also magic....What else is this about?: Family, the ones you make and the ones you are born into and how they mess with your head entirely.When I first found out about this book, I saw a review or an early tagline equate it to James Bond, except with magic. From that point on, I was determined to listen to this book in audio form, but much to my horror Audible Australia and the publisher did not come through for me. However, the author, Brad Abraham did, and he was kind enough to send me an audiobook of Magicians Impossible.Whew. What a ride this was.Magic, stellar worldbuidling and some seriously good characterisation, enough that I am busting for book two like you would not believe. Abraham has created a rich world, and in particular, an avenue with which to explore themes of family that I am looking forward to immensely.Now what is this book actually about?Jason Bishop is coasting through life when he is confronted by the death of his father and is forced to reconsider his choices. This is what death does, it makes you think about things differently, but in Jason\u2019s case it\u2019s how his induction to the world of magic begins. Carter, an old friend of his father\u2019s, comes to tell him the truth about his heritage and his father, Damon. Not Daniel.Because, yes Damon is a secret agent mage fighting the good fight, and hiding Jason away in a sleepy town with adoptive parents, who loved him, and who he loved in return. However, that relationship didn\u2019t soften the harshness of having Damon flit into and out of his life, and years later, Jason now knows why when he\u2019s inducted into the same organisation where he learns about magic, and in particular his magic.And then poop really does hit the fan.Because Abraham gleefully plays with your assumptions and conventions in this book, and I promise where you started this book will be different to where you are when it ends. Abraham skilfully maintains some brilliant worldbuilding, while essentially forcing readers to rethink their assumptions about Jason and this world he now inhabits.Characterisation is wonderfully drawn here, because this book is\u00a0 filled with action, magic fights and escapes and throughout it all you need to be engaged with a wealth of characters -- and Abraham hands down had me on the edge of my seat. Jason becomes part of a chase for a sphere that could change everything for two warring factions within this magic world. But here's the thing: who is to be believed in this war?\u00a0There\u2019s travel to Paris and Mumbai through magic, and a captivating scene in the Louvre that had me transfixed. It\u2019s something else to hear these descriptions fill your head, and it occurred me that the author is a visual writer, drawing his scenes with words and sentences that matter \u2013 everything is there for a reason, and I think in an action-packed book like this it maintains the tension so well.This is Jason\u2019s book \u2013 and I say this because it\u2019s for us to get to know him, before we get to know everyone else properly through him. His evolution from someone who doesn\u2019t know what to do with his life, to someone who accepts what his life has become and the death that might come with it, tells me how much he wants to belong somewhere in a time in his life where he realises he has very little \u2013 his adoptive father has dementia, and his best friend\u2019s widow, who he cared for deeply is moving away \u2013 there are no closer ties in his world than that. So fighting for something, alongside others is important to him and he takes to it with courage and determination.By the end, he is ready for the next phase of this journey, but with a different awareness about himself and this new (old) world of his that makes me excited for book 2.I didn't expect this book to twist me around, and mess with my expectations so, but I think that's the best thing about this -- if a book can make you excited about a genre, it's a keeper!\u00a0Interview with Brad Abraham: http://editingeverything.com/blog/201..."}, {"userName": "Hope Sloper", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23077605-hope-sloper", "userReview": "This was a great, fast paced, easily read, action packed story. It was very interesting and worth the read. However, upon reading the last paragraph of this book, I won't deny that it left me a bit undecided on how to review it. I loved it, yet at the same time, I was disappointed. It took me a few days to realize that the disappointment wasn't the way the novel ended, but that the ending felt premature. The world within Magicians Impossible is enthralling and fascinating, but it's paired with a simple, to a point of it seeming convenient plot. I felt like there was more story to read, but there were no more words. The ending gave me no resolution whatsoever because the entire story read in a very run of the mill way. Which really sucked because the characters are awesome; all the supporting characters and foes (there are many) are all terrific. The world is fantastic and imaginative.  Jason's story is wonderful and engaging.  If the book was thicker, if there were more details on the magical world that was created, I would have totally given this novel five stars.

And maybe people who've trained to be wizards will say, \"Wow, how are you so good at being a wizard, man?\" when they see you in action!Christ, the wish-fulfillment dripping off this book makes me want to scrub.But that's not the worst part. Early in the book there's an admittedly cool scene where a wizard blasts a bunch of mooks with a deck of cards. Blood \"mingle[s] with the gurgling screams of dying men,\" which, okay, doesn't make sense, because liquids and sounds can't mingle, but whatever. Thing is, the next sentence says that they went down, \"bleeding out as silent as a smile.\" YOU JUST TOLD ME THERE WERE GURGLING SCREAMS, BRAD! You can't tell me that and then say they were bleeding out silently!But that's not the worst part. On the previous page, the wizard took a new deck of cards, \"peeled off and discarded the cellophane, bent the cards, and began to shuffle.\" When the deck explodes, \"All fifty-two cards sprayed the room like shrapnel.\" I have opened many decks of cards in my life. There are never 52 cards in a new deck. WHERE ARE THE JOKERS, BRAD?But that's not the worst part. A few pages later a dead mook reanimates, \"one with a Joker Damon had failed to retrieve before still lodged in his carotid.\" Apparently the jokers were included in those 52 cards.

It had all the classic YA fantasy tropes: parents dead, lead character who finds out that they are suddenly super special, magic school, etc. This book didn't work for me, and looking back, I think it was the lack of process. I felt like the author wanted to drop the reader into a world-changing battle, but didn't really want to deal with the lead up. So the protagonist finds out he's a mage, ends up at the mage school, and then easily moves through all the levels without anyone teaching him anything, which made me wonder why there even is a school. There was definitely something missing. For me as a reader, it would have worked better had we skipped over all the school/society stuff, and had the guy discover he was a mage and be thrust right into the battle.I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Billie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3915342-billie", "userReview": "It's an enjoyable read, but there's not really anything here I haven't read before."}, {"userName": "Therin Knite", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13610995-therin-knite", "userReview": "When I started this book, I wasn't sure what to expect, but from the blurb, I thought it had a lot of potential. And by the end of the book, I still thought it had a lot of potential -- in other words, I thought it could have used a bit of improvement. There was an incredible foundation upon which to build an excellent novel, but the execution didn't quite live up to the promise.Starting with the things I DID like about the book:The world-building was fantastic: The concept of the Golden Dawn and the Invisible Hand as opposing magical forces, the Citadel as the otherworldly safe haven of the Invisible Hand, filled with doors to every location on Earth, the different methods of accessing magic powers, the different skill sets and abilities demonstrated throughout the book...Every aspect of the world of Magicians Impossible was interesting and imaginative, and I would have loved to see these ideas live up to their potential.The large cast of diverse characters: The author did a great job showcasing that the magicians come from all over the world. There were a lot of characters with vastly different backgrounds, and they all played pretty interesting roles in the story.Now, onto what I did NOT like:1) The Plot: Here lies my big issue with the book. The plot is, for lack of a better description, a bit of a convoluted mess. Quite frankly, I'm shocked this is all one novel, because the sheer amount of information, twists and turns, and action pieces could very easily have been split into two installments, and both would have been of equal caliber. Instead, what I got was a book with a moderately paced first half that read fairly well, and a second half that was so fast-paced, so overstuffed with twists and turns, that it honestly became hard to follow what was happening. That large cast of characters I liked so much at the beginning became unwieldy as the story headed toward the climax, with the characters traveling to numerous locations every few pages, splitting up into various groups that were hard to keep track of, a dozen plus fights happening in rapid succession, and at least that many plot twists unraveling at the same time.When I got to the last 20% of the story, I was mentally exhausted from trying to keep track of what was happening. There was just too much of EVERYTHING jammed into the second half of a book that was not particularly long, and it really wore on my ability to enjoy the story.If the plot had been trimmed down into a simpler narrative that really let the world-building shine, it would have been a much stronger book, in my opinion.2) The lack of character development: Following from the plot issue, my enjoyment of those diverse characters was limited to their introductions, and for some, brief backstories. Because the plot was moving so fast throughout the second half, very few of the characters got the kind of development they deserved, and as a result, it was hard to care when someone got injured, or died, or ended up in a dangerous situation. I didn't get a chance to come to know many of the characters well, and I was pretty upset by that, because all of them seemed interesting at the surface level. If the plot had simply slowed down instead of rushing forward to its convoluted conclusion, there would have been more space to develop these characters, and to make their fates in the climactic sequence more impactful. So I really feel that this great cast ended up a wasted opportunity, and that was very disappointing.____So, overall, I think Magicians Impossible is an \"okay\" read. The fantastic world-building manages to hold up the overwrought plot just enough to make the story enjoyable. But its weaknesses are pretty obvious, and if you go into it with your expectations too high, I think you'll be disappointed.[NOTE: I received an ARC of this title from the publisher via NetGalley.]"}, {"userName": "Marissa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8247040-marissa", "userReview": "Magicians Impossible is an action packed story that takes place in a complex world of magic. At the surface, the author presents the story of a young man discovering his magical family legacy. He then further develops this concept building up a world of classes of magicians and warring magical gangs. Very creative and interesting world building. This book provides good material that would make a really good movie. It's saturated in cinematic action sequences. Unfortunately, I felt like it had too much going on at times. I had a hard time keeping track of all the minor characters and twists. It wasn't clear to me what the main character's ultimate end game was in terms of the Good versus Evil concept.

It's tough to re-think your world from someone else's eyes. In this case, Jason finally understood that his dad was a magician and didn't go home often because he didn't want anyone to find out that he had a son. I also liked as Jason recalled those instances from his childhood when something slightly... odd happened that he couldn't quite explain, and could now understand that it was his latent magical abilities. I liked that he had the ability to open a door and it be in a different part of the world - reminded me of The Matrix! I got wrapped up in the story and I have to admit, I put off my family for an hour to finish this book and find out what happened next! Would definitely suggest Magicians Impossible for someone who grew up reading Harry Potter.

The writing was fine but I felt it kind of...draggged. Readers are given a lot to digest; action packed scenes and tons of exposition and world building and magical relics and yet the prose felt dry, stilted. I was bored.Secondly, I didn't like Jason Bishop. I thought he was a schlub. A cliche, a chump who suddenly discovers he has all these amazing, magical powers and is destined for soooo many amazing things. He plays like a YA character, a loser and an orphan who is suddenly thrust into this incredible world, and, of course, he comes into his powers and is adept at so many so quickly because the Citadel enhances his abilities and he's so talented...yadda yadda yadda. Basically, Jason Bishop is the Bella Swan of this menagerie of magical misfits.Third, the twists (if you want to go so far as to call them that and can you call them that when you figure them out by the third chapter?) is so very, very corny and predictable. I found myself rolling my eyes just one too many times.The Red Queen is his (yep!) and his dad isn't really (nope!) and he's being played by the very person he's supposed to trust (what a surprise! NOT!) and his friends become foes (duh!) and then they're friends again? (jury's still out) and Jason is the chosen one (his real name is Neo).There's some decent world building, tons of terms being thrown about; Adept, Archmage, Sleepy, Dopey and Grumpy. There's plenty of action and lots of 'borrowing' from more accomplished and talented magical series like the incomparable Harry Potter such as calling non-magical folks \"mundanes.\"Seriously. No fooling. Okay, I laughed really hard at that. Really, really hard.Look, I didn't like Jason. He annoyed me in that irritating way in that you can't understand why he's the hero. He's not particularly bright or witty or interesting. I didn't like or care about anyone, much less empathize or want to know more about them.

It grabs you on page one and continues to impress and propel you forward all the way to the end. Abraham keeps you off balance and uncertain throughout, but the answers feel earned. Even if you guess the answer to some of the puzzles, there\u2019s enough going on to keep you entertained all the way to the end.Jason Bishop is adrift in life. He\u2019s a 30 year old bartender dealing with the death by suicide of his estranged father. It comes as a shock to him to learn that his father was a secret agent in a shadowy, magic-wielding organization (The Invisible Hand) engaged in a war with another equally shadowy magic-wielding organization (The Golden Dawn). Jason is told he also has magical abilities which he must learn to harness or be killed.Jason discovers that not only is he adept at magic, but that it provides a sense of fulfilment he has always been lacking. He also discovers that he never really knew his father. As he is drawn further and further into the conflict between The Invisible Hand and The Golden Dawn, he finds that he is not sure who he can trust, if anybody. The action moves between New York and Paris, as well as other spots around the world heading toward a conclusion that may finally tip the scales one way or the other in the centuries-long battle between the two organizations.I thought the description of this book as Harry Potter meets James Bond was a little hyperbolic. It turns out that it\u2019s a pretty accurate description. Abraham has a flair for cinematic descriptions and high octane action. The war between the Invisible Hand and The Golden Dawn is not described as a war between good and evil, but rather as a war between order and chaos. This is a subtle but important distinction. It introduces shades of grey to the conflict. Jason Bishop\u2019s instincts are telling him not to trust anyone, so he must pick his way through the conflict to arrive at his own determination of what is right and wrong.By making the protagonist first discover his magical abilities at the age of 30, Bradford has lent a sense of maturity to the typical \u201cmagical school\u201d setting. There are a fairly large number of characters introduced here so it is nearly impossible to get to know all of them in great detail, partly by intent and partly by necessity. Quick glimpses into past events involving some of the characters helps sketch out their personalities and roles.The action pieces are what really shine. Explosive action, high stakes and a fast pace will have you flipping through the pages. The scene in the Louvre is a fantastic example that explodes off the page. Brad Abraham has written an outstanding debut and fantasy readers are in store for a real treat. With this year\u2019s debuts of Abraham\u2019s Magicians Impossible and Michael Haspil\u2019s Graveyard Shift, we may have entered into the age of a new style of thriller-fantasy and I can\u2019t wait to read more!I was fortunate to receive an advance copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Vinay Badri", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/311948-vinay-badri", "userReview": "A 3.5 starrerA Harry Potter-esque situation featuring a 30 year bartended ala James McAvoy in Wanted, Magicians Impossible is pretty much a set of the big screen novel that also quite reminds its audience of its roots in the Mission Impossible series as well with the title as well as some scenes where a character goes \"Its impossible\" only to quickly correct themselves based on their powerBartender Jason Bishop's world changes overnight when his dad seemingly committed suicide, only to realize that his dad is no ordinary absentee dad but a gifted magician working for a secret society of magicians trying to prevent the earth from another rogue set of sorcerers.

However, through the course of the training, Jason comes to realize that things arent what they seem and the fact that he cant really trust anyone or anything, especially the pastThe book is seemingly written with a cinematic scope in mind. There are practically no dull moments and the action explodes off the pages. The revelations keep coming fast and so do the betrayals. Jason Bishop, our seemingly dead-beat slacker and an expert at running away and pushing people away, is remarkably adept (heh, see what I did there) at picking up magical skills. In fact, I would say Jason Bishop is a Gary Stu - the seemingly idealized character who keeps on being better in a matter of minutes bettering folks who have been doing this for their lifetime. That to me was possibly the biggest grouse of the series. He achieves in matter of days, what would take a long time. Despite those hitches, the conflict is rather well presented and Jason's backstory is interesting even if there are not-so-subtle hints placed and the blurb giving away a rather big spoiler. The action is super well choreographed and a very interesting use of magic right through the conflict. There are actually some rather quiet moments where Jason looks back with regret at his life prior to the discovery of his heritage. Those scenes were very well written and presents Jason as less than perfect. I think an examination of the book along those lines, building his character more rather than making him an all powerful magician in a blink of an eye would have worked better. The overall baddie is also a bit of a disappointment with rather predictable MCU like goals. However, the friendships that Jason forms is an interesting redeeming facet of this non-stop unputdownable action romp"}, {"userName": "Frank Miceli", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48632816-frank-miceli", "userReview": "Review posted from www.centersquareblog.com From start to finish I honestly did not want to put this book down. From purposefully missing a train to work for some extra reading time to falling asleep not once but twice with this book in my hand, I truly enjoyed every minute spent reading this. Before we even get into the book, just take a look at that cover. Yes, I fell for this book the moment I saw the cover. With that title and the dark, imposing figure, I knew I had to get this the day it was released. Boy, was I not disappointed!Let\u2019s start with the opening 20 or so pages. If after reading that and the opening scene you are not hooked well then I do not understand what someone would want from a book. To be introduced to characters with mystery, a magic trick off the bat, a great fight scene and then an end to the opening chapter that makes you think you are reading a Game of Thrones novel, just WOW!One of the perfect words to describe this book is \u201csecrets\u201d. There are a TON of secrets to be revealed and the author does a masterful job of revealing them at just the right time. I can honestly say that for all but one secret I was 100% surprised. There is one that I figured out but it truly is not obvious and you have to be one of those who lives to solve puzzles with very few clues to be able to figure it out, in my honest opinion. Not only do you have Game of Thrones-esque moments where you are never sure what characters will make it to the end of a chapter let alone the end of the story but I got a real \u201cLost Boys/Peter Pan\u201d type feel. The Invisible Hand is comprised over naturally born Mages who at one point in time were lost and did not fit in to \u201cnormal\u201d society. Yet, they are able to come together to harness their abilities and grow together as a type of \u201cfamily\u201d but also as individuals. However, the question of friendship, family and loyalty is constantly tested throughout the book.Lastly, let\u2019s talk about the main character, Jason, for a quick moment. I think everyone can relate to feeling like they were meant for more at some point in their life. You can relate to feeling like you do not fit in with the world or people around you. As someone in his 30's, you would think Jason would have life \u201cfigured out\u201d by now however that is not the case. Jason has to deal with SO MUCH throughout this story that you can almost underestimate just how strong of a person he is mentally.Magic, mages, war, battles, secrets, spies, family, friendship, greed and deception. You will find a little bit of each in this novel and I am 99.99% sure you will not be disappointed.
