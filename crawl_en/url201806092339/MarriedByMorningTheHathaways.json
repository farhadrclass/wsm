I am aware that you, a fine 19th-century gentleman, should be appalled with my boldness, but I am a 21st-century woman and we are no longer subjected to the restrictive dictates of society that ruled your time. As a Hathaway, I hope you will not only understand this but also be amused by it.Now, I am ashamed to say that I did not like you when I first met you in Mine Till Midnight. You were an uncaring and selfish man, recklessly determined to destroy your own life and hurting your family in the process. Fortunately, you decided to mend your ways in Seduce Me at Sunrise and build your path to redemption. Too bad you were still a rake, but you were a charming one and I started to fall for you. Then came Tempt Me at Twilight and I was a goner. That epilogue was fantastic and I almost died from anticipation while I waited for your book, Married By Morning, to be released. Now that I read it, what can I say that has not been said yet? I absolutely loved it and you, Leo, have become one of my favorite heroes ever. You have truly redeemed yourself and Cat, whom you so endearingly call 'Marks', is a very lucky woman, if I may say so.Speaking of your darling Cat, I was very sad when I learned about her past. Based on what I had read in Tempt Me at Twilight, I had my suspicions and I was not particularly surprised when I saw them confirmed, but it broke my heart anyway. Seeing how she became to trust you enough to tell you what had happened and how you were so supportive of her was wonderful. Forgive me for saying this, but I was a little annoyed with her for taking so long to acknowledge that you belonged together, but I knew she would not be able to resist your playful charm forever - especially after the lovely spectacles you had made specifically for her. That was so lovely and thoughtful!They say that reformed rakes make the best husbands and I am sure you will prove this saying right, but I was enchanted to see that although reformed, you were still wicked enough to keep Cat on her toes. Your marriage will never be boring and your children will be true hellions, I can tell. Congratulations on breaking the Ramsay curse, by the way.Sadly, I must finish this letter now. I will not say goodbye, only farewell, as we will meet again soon in Love in the Afternoon. I cannot wait to see Beatrix finding the one man brave enough to embrace her eccentricity.Please send my best regards to all your family, as I love all of you and think of you as the best friends I would have had if I lived in your time.With love,DinaP.S.: If you happen to run into Lord St. Vincent by any chance, would you please be so kind to tell him that the St. Vinny's Ninnies Club is still going strong and growing every day? I hope you become good friends with him - reformed rakes should have a club of their own - so I get to see him in Love in the Afternoon. That would be just perfect!"}, {"userName": "Auntee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886675-auntee", "userReview": "Loved it. I knew I would, since I'm a sucker for the colorful Hathaway family. And Leo? I didn't have high hopes for him while reading the first in the series (Mine Till Midnight, but with each succeeding book, he kept growing on me, and growing on me...and finally by this book...*sigh*...he finally became a hero worthy of my admiration!:)No plot summary this time, because there's some truly awesome reviews at GR for this one. I'll just add my thoughts/observations... This was only brother Leo Hathaway's story, who needed to get married and produce a male heir within a year, or the family would lose Ramsay house. He finds he's attracted to his recent adversary, the Hathaway sisters' young governess Catherine Marks. But is Catherine (who has a secret about her past) attracted to him?I loved the bickering that went on between Leo and Catherine Marks, even when it got a little nasty. I love how Catherine could dish it out as well as take it! At first I worried that LK would prolong Catherine's prickly attitude towards Leo and that I wouldn't be able to connect with her, but what was I worried about? LK softened her up just in time, and my heart broke for her when her sad past was revealed. So that's what she was hiding. And I thought Harry had it rough...Loved the racy love scenes! This one may have been the hottest of the series so far. And it surprised me a bit. ***possible spoiler*** I thought after Leo and Cat 'did it', that they would immediately wed, but since there was 250 pages to go, what would the book be about? I'm glad LK had Cat keep rejecting Leo's proposals. Not only did it keep Leo determined to convince her (in the most delicious ways), but it also kept the book interesting. Although how Cat could resist Leo is beyond me...****end spoiler***Dodger! I loved that little weasel! And when he was involved in that little bit of suspense at the end...ahh, my heart almost broke! How LK got me to adore a ferret I'll never know.\nMedusa the hedgehog...\nEnjoyed all the scenes where Cat's spectacles either went flying off her face, got misplaced, or were removed by Leo (hot). And the scene where Leo took her to pick out new glasses...really sweet.Loved how Leo convinced himself that he would never put himself through love again, since he \"loved like a madman\". Who wouldn't want to be loved like a madman, if the madman was Leo Hathaway?Loved the witty repartee and double entendres that Leo and Catherine engaged in throughout the book (even though at times Cat was slow to follow Leo's way of thinking...) After a nighttime rendezvous between Cat and an injured Leo almost led to lovemaking...\"Did I hurt you?\" she managed to ask, recalling how she had inadvertantly pushed on his wounded shoulder. \"Does it ache this morning?\" Leo hesitated before replying. \"No, it eventually eased after you left. But the devil knows it wouldn't take much to start up again.\" Catherine was overcome with remorse. \"I'm so sorry. Should we put a poultice on it?\" \"A poultice?\" he repeated blankly. \"On my...oh. We're talking about my shoulder?\"Loved Leo's sexy, passionate talk once his feelings for Cat were realized...\"I have the most profane desire to be in bed with you for...oh, weeks, at least...committing every mortal sin known to man. I'd like to do more than sketch you naked. I want to draw directly on you with feather and ink...flowers around your breasts, trails of stars down your thighs.\" He let his warm lips brush the edge of her ear. \"I want to map your body, chart the north, south, east, and west of you.\"Loved when Leo got all alpha and protective whenever Cat's happiness was threatened by a sleazy man from her past.Loved this lead in to a marriage proposal from Leo:\"You have an evil temper, you're as blind as a mole, you're a deplorable poet, and frankly, your French accent could use some work. But when I put those things together with the rest of you, it makes you into the most perfectly imperfect woman I've ever known.\"\"You are beautiful beyond words. You are kind, amusing, and passionate. You also have a keen intellect, but I'm willing to overlook that..\"What I loved about Leo was that even though he could be a bit cynical and argumentative, he was irreverant, playful, witty, funny, protective, and he dearly loved his sisters, and Catherine Marks, and wasn't afraid to show it. He turned into great husband material.I loved Catherine, and I especially loved how she could exasperate Leo one minute, and the next minute turn him on so much that he couldn't think straight. They threw off some major, major sparks, and as a reader you just knew from way back in the series that something was destined to happen between them. I loved how LK kept the antagonism between them building and building until Leo finally did what he was aching to do for some time.If I had one small complaint about the book, it was the epilogue, which jumped forward one year. ****possible spoiler***In this year, Poppy gave birth, as did Catherine, and so did Win. I wished Win giving birth would have occurred during the main part of the story, since Kev was so worried about the whole pregnancy. I would have liked to have seen that played out a bit, rather than just a sentence in the epilogue. But that was just a minor quibble. I enjoyed this whole story, and loved Leo and Cat as a couple. Cat was a wonderful addition to the eccentric and always amusing Hathaway family. Now only one to go (*sniff*). How is Beatrix ever going to find someone who could compete with her menagerie? 5 starsLeo...Chapter 13..."}, {"userName": "Shawna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802746-shawna", "userReview": "5++ stars \u2013 Historical RomanceOh Leo, Lord Ramsay, you devastatingly handsome, fiendishly charming, hysterically witty, and devilishly wicked man...keeping me up until the wee hours of the morning to finish reading your story rather than for the total ravishment and thorough tupping that I would have preferred from you! I\u2019ve loved every romance thus far in the ongoing, enchanting saga of the unconventional Hathaway family, Cam\u2019s and Amelia\u2019s spirited courtship in Mine Till Midnight, Kev\u2019s and Win\u2019s emotional journey in Seduce Me at Sunrise, and Harry\u2019s and Poppy\u2019s tentative discovery of love in Tempt Me at Twilight, but Leo, Lord Ramsay\u2019s and Catherine\u2019s volatile, yet tender transition from bitter rivals to passionate lovers in the charming Married By Morning might just be my favorite of the series.This is Kleypas at her most brilliant best...it\u2019s utterly fantastic, flat-out phenomenal, sigh-worthy amazing, thoroughly romantic, and riveting from beginning to end. I loooved it and just couldn\u2019t get enough of sinfully sexy, sweet scapegrace Leo, Lord Ramsay, who\u2019s one of my all-time favorite Kleypas heroes. I won\u2019t go into the plot since the book description and some great reviews here on GR already summed it up nicely. I will say that Leo and Catherine, another powerhouse Kleypas couple, are absolute magic together and it\u2019s a wonderful romance not to be missed. Leo is infectiously funny, amusing, and arousing, and I swear, it seemed like almost everything he says is quotable. Strong-willed, prickly, independent, stoic spinster Catherine might be his total opposite, but they\u2019re also a perfect match. And throw a cunning, mischievous, fun-loving ferret named Dodger into the mix, and you\u2019ve got a real winner! It\u2019s a lushly romantic read with remarkable, superbly crafted, and wonderfully alluring characters, an intriguing, unforgettable story, strong emotional depth, witty banter, laugh out loud humor, erotic sexual tension, and steamy passion that\u2019s all blended together beautifully and perfectly paced. Lisa Kleypas writes the most splendid, compelling, and lusciously sensual romances that always steal my heart and leave me breathless with pure rapture over the sheer wonderment of falling in love, and Married By Morning is another treasure for my keeper shelf! If you\u2019re a fan of Kleypas and/or historical romance and haven\u2019t yet read the delightful Wallflowers and Hathaways series, then what on earth are you waiting for?! Big, exuberant 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "UniquelyMoi ~ BlithelyBookish", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1113032-uniquelymoi-blithelybookish", "userReview": "I hope you\u2019ll be able to look past the cheesiness of this review and be able to understand what it is I\u2019m feeling, even though I can\u2019t quite find the words to eloquently express my thoughts about Married by Morning in a way that will do it justice.This was simply one of the most delightful books I\u2019ve read in a very long time. I had no doubt that I\u2019d like it, as I do most all of Lisa Kleypas\u2019 books, but this far exceeded my expectations! Leo Hathaway, Lord Ramsay and Catherine Marks, Governess, made this book impossible to put down with their constant banter and obvious, though not to each other, affection for one another. In the previous books in this series, we see that after the death of his fianc\u00e9, Laura Dillard and his own brush with death, Leo gradually stopped living, rather, falling into a mere existence of deadly vices and debauchery. His family tried to help him, but it became clear that he didn\u2019t want help. He wanted to die. Having hit rock bottom, Cam Rohan, his brother-in-law, was at last able to reach Leo in the darkness he\u2019d enveloped himself in and finally, finally, the Leo that everyone knew and loved began to resurface. But as is often the case, I believe the overwhelming grief of the loss of his beloved Laura had left him forever changed. Although death was no longer something he wished for, he spent too much time and money in gambling halls and just as much time and money on women. He was bitter, cynical and immoral \u2013 all the things that Catherine despised in a man.Catherine Marks had her own tragic past, one she\u2019d been running from for many years. Having been fortunate enough to find work as a governess for the Hathaways, she was given her first glimpse into what being a part of a real family felt like, even though they weren\u2019t hers. She stood on the outside watching the love between the siblings and their spouses knowing that this was as close as she would come to ever having a family of her own. Prim, proper, secretive and unyielding, she was all the things Leo hated in a woman. So, we\u2019ve watched them spar, compete, and try to outdo each other, barely able to tolerate one another. That is, until they got their own story and, in the heat of an argument found such passion in one kiss that all the animosity, all the bitterness fell away, laying the foundation for a truce that should at least keep them from wanting to throttle each other. Or so you'd think. Finding humor in the direst of circumstances, Leo constantly caught me off guard with his comments, making me laugh out loud. He doesn\u2019t take many things seriously, especially himself, probably a result of the self imposed hell he\u2019d spent too many years living in. Watching as one by one, layer after layer, Leo\u2019s defenses fall away allowing Catherine deeper and deeper into his heart, was so gratifying for me. I loved his realization that he could love someone besides Laura, and that he himself could be loved. And Catherine, coming to trust Leo, and seeing past the armor of indifference he had sheltering his heart, was just incredibly uplifting. And please don\u2019t laugh at me, but I felt like, in Catherine, I was watching a flower opening, with its delicate petals unfolding to soak up and bask in the sun\u2019s warming rays, and that sun was called Leo. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read a book in which two characters were so totally opposite and yet, so perfectly matched. And very few authors can pull this off, but Lisa Kleypas does it with consistency, giving us characters that we see as real people with needs. And I\u2019d be remiss if, before ending this review, I didn\u2019t mention the very brave, ever loyal Dodger, who came to Catherine\u2019s defense by biting a bad guy, and receiving a severe blow in the process. I\u2019m even more convinced that he deserves his own book.Married by Morning has become one of my all time favorite books and Leo and Catherine one of my all time favorite couples. And there\u2019s no doubt, if I could choose to have my life written by anyone at all, it would be Lisa Kleypas. What I wouldn\u2019t give to be one of her characters, because even through the most difficult of times, you always know you\u2019re going to come out on the other side happier, stronger and unconditionally loved."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "Married by Morning was such a delightful book. It fully exceeded my high expectations. The sparks between Leo Hathaway, Lord Ramsay, and Catherine Marks in the prior Hathaway books promised good tension and a fun read, but Ms. Kleypas managed to draw on deep wells of emotion and passion in writing this story, that made it even fuller than I expected. I had the feeling that Catherine would prove to be fairly tortured for a Kleypas heroine, and it turned out I was right. She had some deeply buried issues, related to her abandonment by her father to the dubious care of her grandmother and aunt, and the heinous future they had planned for her. I was quite surprised at the terrible fate that Catherine barely avoided, and glad that her brother, Harry Rutledge, came to her rescue in time. But, his saving her wasn't soon enough for her to avoid the deep emotional trauma of what she suffered. Since that point, she has buried herself within the prim disguise of a spinster governess, although she isn't that much older than her charges, the younger Hathaway sisters, Poppy and Beatrix.Leo Hathway was her Achilles' Heel, almost from the beginning. A strong, vital man who made her feel things she didn't want to feel. He represented what she thought she despised, but Leo proves to be the man for her. They trade insults freely, but underneath is a sizzling attraction that is more than obvious to the Hathaways.I simply adored Leo in this book. He was the consummate hero in pursuit, in all the best ways. He is determined to woo Catherine and give her exactly what she needs: love, understanding, protection, and companionship. Because he realizes that she's the one woman for him, even though he vowed not to fall in love again after losing Laura. Catherine brings him to life, making him want her more than is prudent and convenient. And, in true form for him, he barely skirts society's rules chasing his reluctant heroine. I could see why Catherine was hesitant to accept Leo's proposal, with her past and what she suffered--even though I hoped she'd say yes to his proposal. Although Leo was frustrated that she continued to hold herself back, he didn't give up. I really admired him for that. I think Catherine needed a man who really focused on her, wooing her powerfully.Leo was a dark horse in this series, although it shouldn't have been a surprise at how well he turned out as a hero. He went from the darkest depths of despair after the loss of his first love, turning into a dissolute rake bent on self-destruction. His sojourn in France gives him the time and space he needs to heal his broken heart and shattered soul. When he comes back, he's still a bit of a rake, completely irreverent and wicked in the things he says, but he finds a sense of purpose in taking care of his properties as Lord Ramsay, and occasionally doing architectural commissions, spending time with his family. When Ms. Marks shows up as the governess for his younger, unmarried sisters, he wonders why they hired such a buttoned-up, bitter hag. Yet, he finds himself unwittingly attracted to her. In fact, she becomes an obsession he cannot deny himself. When he finds out that he must marry to keep Ramsay house, he isn't eager to find a bride at first. But soon, his heart tells him that only one bride will do, Miss Marks. And Leo moves mountains and does the sweetest little things to prove his love. It made me sigh to see such a good woman who had been forsaken in many ways find a man who loved her so very much, and she loved in return.This was a simple book, but rich in content. It has the characteristic, beautiful writing that makes Lisa Kleypas one of my favorite authors. It is very sensual, with the compelling attraction between Leo and Catherine. Stolen kisses that will melt your socks off, moments of intimacy full of passion, and a love that conquers both Leo and Catherine's reluctant hearts. I could not help but root for this couple. And of course, it's always lovely to catch up with the Hathaways, and their spouses. It feels like coming home."}, {"userName": "Alp", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26653561-alp", "userReview": "I don\u2019t quite believe myself I gave this book 4 stars. Yeah, 4 stars! It was way better than my expectations!Well, I enjoyed Leo and Catherine\u2019s story more than I thought I would. To be honest, I didn\u2019t expect much from this one because I\u2019d never liked Catherine since I first knew her in Tempt Me at Twilight, the third installment in The Hathaways series (I\u2019ve read this series totally out of order). Besides, during the first 15% of the story, I still couldn't warm up to her. I almost stopped reading this book because of her, but I trust Lisa Kleypas and I was curious about the mystery of Catherine\u2019s past, so I decided to keep reading a little further to see if she got better. Good thing I did, because somehow she was able to redeem herself in the remaining story. The better I got to know her, the more adorable she became. I started to see her soft side and how vulnerable she really was.Leo is so endearing and funny. I couldn\u2019t help but swoon over him! Although I enjoyed the romance between these two, I didn\u2019t understand why he felt so attracted to her in the first place.I would have given this book 5 stars if Catherine hadn\u2019t kept turning down Leo\u2019s marriage proposals over and over again. It was so damn annoying, so much so that I secretly rooted for him to give up on her. (Evil me! Haha!) There\u2019s a fine line between being independent and being overly stubborn. And she was too stubborn! By the way, this was a sweet, funny, and emotional read. I enjoyed this book for the most part.

Yeah, i did!!! But you have to tolerate me for once more!!!And the most strange thing is that i love also Leo Hathaway!!!\nWhy strange??? I have to admit that in the first book Leo was my least favorite from all of them...He was self-destructed and the worst thing was that he didn't care for anybody else, so he put in many troubles his loving family...But the best of all was that the Hathaways sisters never stopped loving him unconditional even though he wasn't worth it at that time...From the second book Leo already had started to change... According to her sisters, he manage to earn some pieces from his old shelf back!!!And at this point, i started to change my opinion for him... You see, you have to be from stone to not adore him!!!He is witty, funny, clever, charming and beautiful. How can you resist him???Okay, he is a little bit cocky and arrogant also, but that's fine with me!!!The thing is that Leo doesn't take life serious anymore and he just want to enjoy everything he can.He doesn't want to get married and he doesn't want to fall in love again....Because all his self-destruction came because he lost the girl that he had once loved.And as he said by himself...\n\"I can't ever go through that again. I love like a madman.\"\"It might not be like that again.\"\"No, it would be worse. Because I was only a boy then. And now who I am, what I need ... it's too damned much for anyone to manage.\"\nBut things began to change for him when he started to interact with Miss Marks, the paid companion of his younger sisters...Catherine Marks is a stiff and strick young woman... Leo from the first time that he mets her, he enjoyed to provoke her and to interact in lectic battles with her...And I have to admit that i enjoyed too much those interactions between Leo and Marks.From the second book, we could take glimpses from Leo's lust for this mysterious creature that was certain that she was hiding something from her past...As the books were passing we discovered that Miss Marks was disguised herself to be unrecognisible and she was having nightmares about her past. What was her secrets???In this book, Leo received a letter that informed him that he will lose the Ramsey house, that the family built from the beginning with so much love and work, if he don't get married and have a heir in the time of a year...But Leo didn't take it too serious... Others was the reasons that he got obsessed with Miss Marks...But Cat had her own nightmares to fight, nightmares that got back to hunt her with flesh and bones... and Leo wanted to stand by her side, but she was too afraid to let him be there...But Leo was stubborn and insisted... So you know what kind of things happened...I have to say that i really enjoyed and this book in the series...Leo's character was amazing. He was so funny and charming...My objections were in Cat. She was also funny but i was a little bit tired from her reactions...She was having a man like Leo in her feet and she was being difficult... Yeah, i know that she was having her reasons, but still i can't accepted it!!!And why the hell this book was named \"Married by morning\" since there were so many rejections...My poor Leo... He was a very strong and determined man. Nothing could stop him to have what he wanted...And now, i won't hide you the fact that i already started the final book and i can say that i am already in love..."}, {"userName": "Rane", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1987431-rane", "userReview": "At the start of the The Hathaways series, I will admit, I really disliked Leo. He was such a self-center baby, and didn\u2019t care the damage he was doing to his family whom loved him. At the same time I was curious at what LK planned for him. Slowly she reveled the Leo whom has faced his demons and is walking out of the shadows. And by Seduce Me at Sunrise and Tempt Me at Twilight, I was looking forward to his and Cat story. And with the cliffhanger at the end of TMAT, I was a little leery it wouldn\u2019t stack up, but my fears were for not, as I was quickly wrapped up with Leo and Cat\u2019s foes to lovers story. This story was thankfully dead aim focus on Cat and Leo with the rest of the Hathaways well and truly in the background, not so much in the foreground like the first three books. It was great to see glimpse of everyone and how much love the Hathaways had for one another, but I was happy that stayed in the background.  The foreshadowing was hinted about Cat for awhile, but everything is finally reveled about her hard past. It\u2019s not a super-sweet past either, but tough and sad for one so young. You understand her actions toward Leo in the beginning, and her banter/fighting with him makes sense. I really enjoyed the character Cat, and her no-nonsense ways, and how she always seem to put Leo in his place with a few choice words or a look. She also had a big heart which she hid for so long, and the need for love and family. Both she finally found with Leo and the Hathaways and her brother. The one problem I did have with Cat is her always running away. Cat always came off as strong even in the face of danger, which she shows when she comes face to face with her past. This running away made me annoyed with her. Thankfully Leo and Dodger are right behind her. Leo is the biggest surprise for me through the Hathaway series (so far) I didn\u2019t like him, but through MBM I was head over heels in love with him. Leo was scared of losing to love again, and really didn\u2019t want to go through that again, but the pull between him and Cat was so strong, he knew he would never let her go. Leo was dogmatic in his pursuit of Cat, and every hot and funny moment was pure bliss. I enjoyed every moment of these two, and wanted more,More,MORE!  Leo and Cat has a lot of things that caused them to run, but finding love in one another, they finally stopped running from one another, and running toward each other. I was so happy to see their HEA and by the end of this book, I was still in bliss.Overall: a wonderful/awesome addition to the Hathaways series, Leo and Cat (and Dodger!) were just down right perfect from start to finish. I could go on and on about how much I love this book, but will contain and say, it was a joy to read. I can\u2019t wait for the last installment of this wonderful series!"}, {"userName": "Kainat \u300aHUFFLEPUFF & PROUD\u300b", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14717996-kainat-hufflepuff-proud", "userReview": "It's a re-read.I love Leo Hathaway!

(3.5 stars)[1852, Hampshire and London, England:]So here it is! The long awaited romance of \"Marks\" and Leo! I know I'm not alone when I say that by the end of the second Hathaway book, SEDUCE ME AT SUNRISE, I was sensing that they would be matched up in the future and was already anxiously anticipating it. Many readers have been counting down the days till this book came out, and that same pressure and excitement also made me nervous - would it be able to live up to our expectations? I'm very conflicted on what my answer to that question is and cannot give a straight yes or no (hence the middling rating of 3.5 stars). One thing I will say is that I don't think this book should be read on its own, for two reasons: 1) reading Hathaway Books 2 and 3 will allow you to enjoy the Marks and Leo relationship *that* much more, and 2) see my CONS section. SUMMARYCatherine Marks (23) has been the governess and now-companion for the two youngest Hathaway girls for three years and during that time, the antagonistic relationship between Cat and her employer, Leo Hathaway, Viscount Ramsay, has only grown stronger. Leo (30) has changed from the drunken wastrel that he became following the death of his fiancee, however he is still irreverent and enjoys nothing more than a good argument with the pinch-faced eyeglass-wearing \"Marks\" (as he so \"affectionately\" calls her). They are like night and day: the relaxed, charming, devil-may-care facade aristocrat and the closemouthed, rigid (though NOT unkind!), somewhat stern governess. The normal routine of their relationship - one of constant fighting and teasing - changes drastically one afternoon when Leo finally gives in to the urge and kisses Cat ... and she kisses him back! There is no going back from the desire and attraction they have now been forced to admit they feel for one another, and each must face their own issues before any HEA can take place. Leo struggles with his increasingly resolute decision to pursue their relationship, while nonetheless wanting to avoid falling in love at all cost, not willing to put himself at risk of suffering another heartbreak. Cat has really only ever known solitude and loneliness in her life, and she is hiding a mysterious past that has left her in doubt of her own worth and wary and mistrustful of men. Throw in Cat's concerned brother who also happens to be Leo's sister's husband, this mysterious past coming back to haunt her in the form of a vile 40-year-old lecher whose fixation borders on obsession, two people who wish our heroine ill, and a will that says Leo must marry within a year and produce a male heir or they will all have to leave Ramsay house, and you'll find yourself MARRIED BY MORNING! PROSLeo is a fabulous hero and granted, I've had a soft spot for him from the beginning ... well maybe not the *very* beginning, when he was somewhat of a selfish lout, but almost :-). I've always loved that he calls Cat \"Marks\" and you can't help but smile when he's teasing her and trying to get a rise out of her. We see a decent amount of all members of the Hathaway clan in this book, which fans of the family will enjoy, and the repartee among the Hathaway siblings and their respective partners is wonderful to read and often very humorous. Cat was intriguing and I'd been curious about her back story since we're first introduced to her; it doesn't disappoint, though how it plays into the book might (see CONS). One of the strongest things about this book is that you really feel the characters of Cat and Leo belong together; you can see how they just fit right and actually picture them as a real-life couple. They are both what the other one needs and are extremely strong individuals in their own right, but made all the stronger - because they're made vulnerable - with the other by their side. We see their growth - Leo, over the course of the series, and Cat, in this particular book. Leo is finally able to gain the peace and happiness he deserves and Cat is able to let herself be vulnerable and rely on another person. (And did I mention I *LOVE* their kissing game, lol - so cute). Their banter is fabulous, the arguing/teasing is wonderful, and their tenderness and care for one another is adorable (and makes one oh so envious, ::sigh::). CONSWhen I started the book, it was a rocky beginning and I was afraid that I was not going to be able to get into the story. It improved, but it really wasn't until the second half that the central relationship began to feel authentic. Part of the reason for this is that everything happens too quickly right at the beginning: much of Cat's \"mysterious\" past comes to light (by chapter three), she and Leo face their attraction, Leo begins intently pursuing her, etc. If someone starts starts the series with MBM it will definitely be jarring, but even for me, who has read the other 3 books multiple times, I felt like we were thrown into the story headfirst and blind. Yes, it's been building up for a few books, but even so, those previous interactions and passages don't do enough to smooth the way. Additionally, THIS is the book featuring Leo and Marks' story, so it's in THIS book that I want to see the full development of their relationship, (as much) start to finish (as possible). Although at times the chemistry between Marks and Cat was sizzling, for the first half of the book I did not feel it AT ALL - Kleypas' skill in writing the passages was evident, but it just wasn't believable to me (which I think is a result of my criticism above). I also felt - again, especially at the beginning - that much more of the story was told from Leo's POV than from Cat's, so although Leo was very accessible, Cat remains an elusive character for quite awhile. It drove me crazy that she kept on \"my-lording\" him so far into the book; even the second time they sleep together, Cat says \"my lord\" while they're in bed together!Finally, the mystery-villain subplot seemed contrived. Why would this man from Cat's past be obsessed for so long? Echoing another reviewer, Kleypas seems to have a penchant for certain evil subplots: particularly villainous men with an unhealthy fixation on the heroine (this book, WORTH ANY PRICE, THE DEVIL IN WINTER, SEDUCE ME AT SUNRISE, BECAUSE YOU'RE MINE, etc.) and kidnappings (most of the ones previously mentioned, plus DREAMING OF YOU, TEMPT ME AT TWILIGHT, etc.). The other side of Cat's past involving her family was interesting and unfortunately not too hard to imagine, though one thing that kept driving me nuts was that these family members were supposed to be of the lower class and not very sophisticated, yet they spoke perfect English and had an admirable vocabulary. HATHAWAY SERIES(Note: LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON comes out June 29! Two Kleypas books in two months: the HR goddesses are smiling on us!! And although I wasn't looking forward to Beatrix's story because she's always seemed immature in previous books, reading the excerpt at the back of this book has me VERY intrigued.) 1) MINE TILL MIDNIGHT - Amelia and Cam 2) SEDUCE ME AT SUNRISE - Book 2, Win and Merripen 3) TEMPT ME AT TWILIGHT - Book 3, Poppy and Harry 4) MARRIED BY MORNING - Leo and Cat (\"Marks\") 5) LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON - Beatrix and Christopher BOTTOM LINEIt's an enjoyable read and although I can't bring myself to give it 4 stars - I had too many issues, particularly with the first half of the book - I don't regret visiting the same bookstore twice in one day to finally get my hands on a copy or staying up late at night to finish reading it. If you haven't read the other Hathaway books, I would definitely urge you to do so before approaching this one (they're wonderful, so it's no hardship, I promise!). P.S.For those readers like myself who don't like the hero or heroine to have had someone whom they truly loved before their HEA-partner (oh we're horrible!): although Leo did honestly love Laura, there is no vying for affection here and he is fully over her by the time this story takes place."}, {"userName": "Kimberly Carrington-Fox", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33752173-kimberly-carrington-fox", "userReview": "Nuestra rese\u00f1a en A la cama con... un libro Mi amor eterno para Leo.

After reading Leo suffering the lost of his love Laura. Go into self destruct mode, nearly kill himself in the first book. To really turn his life around starting with the second book I was dying for him to have his HEA and for it to be a great one. Cat and Leo's story has been building up since book two. Fighting like cats and dogs I figured this book would explode with passion. Sadly this book was just okay for me.\n\u201cNo. In fact\u2014\u201d She broke off abruptly. \u201cIn fact?\u201d Leo prompted. \u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d \u201cNothing.\u201d \u201cYou were. Something along the lines of liking me against your will.\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d Catherine said primly, but Leo saw the twitch of a smile at her lips. \u201cIrresistibly attracted by my dashing good looks?\u201d he suggested. \u201cMy fascinating conversation?\u201d \u201cNo, and no.\u201d \u201cSeduced by my brooding glances?\u201d He accompanied this with a waggish swerving of his brows that finally reduced her to laughter. \u201cYes, it must have been those.\u201d-Cat and Leo\n\n\n\u201cI have never said this to anyone before.\u201d Leo\u2019s voice was like ragged velvet. \u201cBut the idea of you with child is the most insanely arousing thing I\u2019ve ever imagined. Your belly all swollen, your breasts heavy, the funny little way you would walk \u2026 I would worship you. I would take care of your every need. And everyone would know that I\u2019d made you that way, that you belonged to me.\u201d-Leo\nLeo was amazing. He was charming, sarcastic, funny, and super protective. He is the reason this book got 3 stars. He and Dodger the ferret! He really shined in this book. He wanted Cat and he romanced her. Waited for her. He slowly broke down her walls and showed her, she could trust him. He respected her and made her feel beautiful. I never felt like Leo wanted his dead ex more or that he still loved her. Leo was all about Cat. Leo was great which is why I was so disappointed with Cat's pushing him away until like the 98% mark of the book! I wanted to pull my hair out. At the start of the book Cat was sweet, vulnerable and I could understand her fear. When the book laid out the life she was running from and we readers got the back story I could sympathizes with her. But I lost all that sympathy after she slept with Leo repeatedly and then turned down his numerous marriage proposals. I may have forgiven her cowardly fear if she didn't push Leo away until the last few damn pages before the epilogue! Really what Leo was good enough to sleep with but not good enough to Marry? Leo suffered too much for her to push him away so damn much. It just pissed me off. And like I said I could understand her fear to a point, but she just took that shit too far. I wanted to shake her hard and be like \"Get the fuck over yourself already whiner!\" just sayin!\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to be charming,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more annoying than someone trying to make one feel better when one wants to wallow.\u201d Leo bit back a grin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said contritely. \u201cGo on and wallow. You were doing so well at it until I interrupted.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d She heaved a sigh and waited a moment. \u201cBlast,\u201d she finally said, \u201cI can\u2019t do it now.\u201d-Cat and Leo\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe you. Because I know how unhappy you would become, seeing your sisters\u2019 marriages, remembering how devoted your parents were to each other, and knowing that ours was a counterfeit by comparison. A parody.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you so certain that we won\u2019t come to care for each other?\u201d \u201cI just am. I\u2019ve looked inside my heart, and it\u2019s not there. That\u2019s what I meant before. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to trust anyone enough to love them. Even you.\u201d Leo\u2019s face was expressionless, but she sensed something dark lurking beneath his self-control, something that hinted of anger, or exasperation. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re unable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that you don\u2019t want to.\u201d-Cat and Leo\nThere wasn't a lot of other Hathaways in this book as there were in other books and I missed them. Poppy was in this book with Harry more than the others. I wanted more Win, Kev, Cam, Amelia, and Bea. Dodger the ferret was adore in this book. I kinda want a pet ferret now lol! Overall Leo saved the book for me. I didn't hate Cat I just thought she could have loved my Leo back sooner. I did enjoy the epilogue, although with their relationship not really being sealed til the last few pages it made the ending feel rushed. I have been really looking forward to Bea's story. I hope I love it better than this one. Still a great series and I am still loving the Hathaway!\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he said shortly. As he stared at Catherine\u2019s small, shivering figure, he felt his color run high, and his soul open with an emotion deeper than he had ever imagined could reside in him. \u201cI love you, Marks. My heart is completely and utterly yours. And unfortunately for you, the rest of me comes with it.\u201d Leo paused, struggling for words, when they had always come so easily to him. But these had to be the right words. They meant too much. \u201cI know I\u2019m a bad bargain. But I\u2019m begging you to have me anyway. Because I want the chance to make you as happy as you make me. I want to build a life with you.\u201d He fought to steady his voice. \u201cPlease come to me, Cat, because there\u2019s no surviving you. You don\u2019t have to love me back. You don\u2019t have to be mine.

This series is positively one of the best and it should not be missed. Lisa Kleypas has done it again and every book in this series just gets better than the last, Leo has been a shining character in the previous books and he comes out blasting in his own book.Leo Hathaway self proclaimed devil, he has the wit, charm and sex appeal to blow any female out of her skirts. He has been through his fair share of ups and down, and he knows he is lucky to be alive and kicking. There is only one person who gets under his cool fa\u00e7ade and that is Catherine Marks, companion to his baby sister, and the prim and proper Marks gets under his skin. They fight like cat and dog and can never see to eye to eye. One thing they know for sure is that they hate each other, or so they say.Seems Catherine might be the ying to Leo\u2019s yang and its gonna be a joyride to prove how much they belong to each other. It comes as no surprise that their little squabbles make the book so feckin exciting, Leo\u2019s quick wit is a force to be reckoned with, its always a laugh to hear the next thing that comes out of his mouth. Their love don\u2019t come easy because Catherine has a sordid pass and she needs to face her demons in order to love Leo properly.Seriously the sordid pass was so blah to me, I was like get over it already and take Leo\u2019s pants off. I felt there was nothing for Catherine to feel remotely bad about, you had a bad childhood you can\u2019t blame yourself for that, and Leo himself is practically a slut, come on. I still feel that Catherine doesn\u2019t quite fit with Leo, but she is a likeable character and she does hold her own to the little devil that is Lord Ramsey. Together they could blow fish out of the water, their best scenes were the naked time. Miss Kleypas knows how to write a sex scene and its always a little bit wicked.Book 4 might not be my favourite in the series but Leo is my fave character, god I love that man. The Hathaways is family not to be missed, they stand out from the aristocratic bunch, they are eccentric, funny and so lovable, every book in this series is a little bit of heaven. I give a big \u201c CHECK THIS SERIES OUT\u201d you wont be disappointed. Please keep mop and bucket handy, extreme excitement in the pants is a side effect. Just remember to remain a Fookin lady!\"I don't care. I can't have a wife named Blossom. Every night I would feel as if I were calling in one of the cows\".Awww Leo you wonderful S.O.B!!!!I can't wait to read the last book in the series, I just know its gonna be awesome."}, {"userName": "Princess under cover", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9604542-princess-under-cover", "userReview": "Well, I think I like this book less than the first or second time I read it. I like it for Leo, but I really don't like Marks (Cat). I get that she's had a hard life, it's difficult for her to trust people, but she's been living with the Hathaways for THREE YEARS!! She's gotten to know all of the family so intimately and been treated as part of the family. She's fought with Leo from the start, but she knows how he loves his family and they love him, so SURELY, she knows that he's a person worth loving!PLUS, he told her his past from the beginning of the novel. She should understand why he's the way he is. But it takes FOUR proposals and a near-death experience to whittle down her reservations. REALLY?????!!!!As much as I enjoy their bantering and the push and pull (it was really 99% pull from Leo and maybe a tiny bit push from Marks), I just never warmed to her. Her best moment was when she rescued him from the ruins. And when she helped take care of him after. But that was all done by 1/3 of the way through. The rest of it made me want to slap her silly.So, I'm gonna have to take a star off my original rating of 4 stars. 5 stars for Leo, 2 for Marks.

The humour, the heart, it's all been there. But if you've been following my recent string of Retro Reviews, you'll know there have been a slight low point in each of them; a low point that was always tempered by the supporting cast and other family members, with short but wonderful POV switches to the enduring romances of the previous couples in the series, but a low point nonetheless. Married by Morning, however, is free of this trend.The fourth in this delightful series focuses on the sole male of the grouping. Leo has had a remarkable character arc over the course of these books. Initially we know him to be inclined towards self-harm, drinking himself to the brink over and over again, as well as cavorting about town as a well-known rake, all to soothe the hurt from his lost love. The sickness that had overtaken both Leo and Winnifred when they were younger was the same sickness that had snatched the life of his fianc\u00e9e, and it took years for him to recover from the loss. Years of being low and resentful towards life, right up until the moment he almost took his own. Sent away to France to watch over Winnifred as she sought to undo the damage done to her lungs, Leo was able to find peace. He let the pain go, rediscovered his good humour, achieved sobriety, and knew if he ever were to risk loving again, he'd lose himself to despair all over again. Better to just avoid it altogether.He returns to England and his family, to discover they have taken on a governess to assist the younger sisters with etiquette lessons. Miss Marks' influence may or may not have helped Poppy (book three) find happiness but there's no doubt that the girls have found a balance in their ways. And for all that Leo is glad of it, he's helpless to resist the urge to torment the governess a bit. Tease her. Challenge her. Even moreso when she was determined to be unmoved by Leo's charm. Who is this dour, unattractive, excessively pinned and starched young woman and why does she fascinate him so?In book three, we find out Catherine Marks is much more then she appears to be, both literally and figuratively. She revealed a startling connection to Poppy's new husband but remained tightly laced about her remaining secrets. Already she feels she's said too much, feels the risk is too great, but Leo gets under her skin in a way no one \u2013 no man \u2013 has ever done, and in a way she finds herself craving despite her better judgment. But when a figure from her past recognizes her at a ball, Catherine is convinced she has only one option \u2013 to run, hide and start over somewhere new. Leo, discovering her disappearance the morning after, is stunned, hurt and infuriated by her departure; and naturally he chases her down to convince her to return and offer her the ultimate protection.I find I'm reluctant to hint at anything further in this storyline because I went into it blind and the reveals are not something I ever would've predicted. Catherine's back story is both heartbreaking and fascinating and the villains of the piece are loathsome and tragic in equal measure. I found this particular arc of the story to be a perfect counterpoint to the sexy and hilarious bickering that is such a cornerstone of Leo and Catherine's relationship, and despite the 'pretend to be married and then compromise the heroine at a coaching inn' element, which let's be honest is a favourite for most of us, the physical relationship between them takes on an additional layer because of what Catherine has been taught to believe about her self-worth and what desire implied about her nature. The way Leo wears her down, the war he wages against her \u2013 is delicious.Leo is so much more than a charming jokester. Kleypas makes him irresistibly likeable but he's also very self-aware. He has been hurt, brought low, and yet is not ashamed of his past. He knows it has shaped him, made him the man he is, and is determined never to return to his wild and self-destructive ways. He moves past the point where he'd wanted to die, but that is quite different from wanting to actually live instead of just existing. And oh, he wants to live now. There's a scene where Leo is hurt and he's resisting the drugs that will help to numb his pain because he knows the temptation such oblivion offers. He knows he is a recovering addict and if he must give into it in order to heal he needs someone to hold him accountable, to keep him from backsliding. He's so aware of himself and it's both beautiful and bittersweet.Catherine, on the other hand, is closed off, reluctant to trust, and painfully aware that though she has come to love the Hathaways, she is not part of their family and that she unlikely to ever have one of her own. She's a woman who has been saved from the worst kind of life, given a second chance, heeds her intellect over her heart and is convinced she's unloveable. Which is why the kissing scenes, where Leo challenges her to keep her head when caught up in the moment, are hilarious and wonderfully sweet. She is unable to give the correct answers to his questions post-kiss, completely turned about by his effect on her, and it's in those vulnerable moments we see just how desperately she wants to be touched, to be loved, as she stops wanting to prove Leo wrong and instead just wants him to hold her again.Unlike previous stories in this series, there's less veering off track to check in with the couples that came before and I suspect that's mainly due to the fact that this is such a strong pairing. I absolutely loved the wrap-up chapter that shows that even though they have finally come together as a couple, their relationship is not so different from how it had always been, there were just new aspects to it. Which only proves, again, how right they are together. Yes, if you're wondering, I\u2019m a big puddle of goo right now and I'm not ashamed to admit it.With only one final Hathaway sibling to pair up, I'm reluctant to rush into the end. This is heightened by the fact that I have huge expectations for the finale because Beatrix is, in a lot of ways, the glue of this family. She's the youngest, the sweetest, the most perceptive, and she's given us such joy with her bluestocking-esque ability to natter off random facts about animals and rescue any that are injured or needing homes. It's hard to imagine that any man deserves her.. but I guess I'll find out shortly if Kleypas has given her someone worthy of her.As always, if you haven't yet discovered these wonderful books or this wonderful author, I would highly recommend both."}, {"userName": "Marian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42104455-marian", "userReview": "Genial como los anteriores.- Crean adicci\u00f3n, les aclaro.- Me encantan todos los personajes.-"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4784586-andrea", "userReview": "Buddy-re-read with Lacey I'm downgrading this to 3.5 stars generously rounded up.

If only Catherine hadn't been so... How to say this nicely. I mean, I get it. She has issues.

It's still not my favorite in the series."}, {"userName": "Ursula", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52878188-ursula", "userReview": "Story 5 stars.Audio 3 stars.I read this a couple of years ago and have re-read it several times. It's one I go back to when I need a fix of a really enjoyable, emotional and witty HR.This was the first time I listened to the audio, narrated by Rosalyn Landor. I know she is a fave with many, and has a great voice for traditional HR. But I have just gone through all the Loretta Chase books narrated by Kate Reading, and I much prefer her voice for the lighter books. (Her men's voices are fabulous. I never think it is a woman being a man. Her accents are great and I just love listening to her.) Rosalyn Landor's Leo just did not work well for me. He sounded way too pompous and stuffy- the antithesis of his character. Her women's voices are good, just don't like her men.The story is fabulous but DO read the previous books in the series to get a fuller picture of Leo and Cat's relationship. Leo is wonderful- irreverent, intelligent, creative, sensitive, sensual, hilarious, emotional and HAWT. The fact that he says he \"loves like a madman\" (totally devoted) means he also never gives up on Cat- I want me one of those! These sort of heroes are done so well by LK, when she is on fire.Dark-Haired, blue-eyed- I reckon Henry could be Leo......"}, {"userName": "Beanbag Love", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2598237-beanbag-love", "userReview": "This was just delicious. I smack my lips thinking back over what I've just read. Just lovely.I am so happy Kleypas was able to keep the spark of Cat and Leo's relationship alive even as they fell into divine and rapturous love. They continue to bait each other, evolving beautifully into a sort of comedy duo rather than sparring partners. Not that it doesn't have angst. Oh, there's angst aplenty here. We all knew Leo had some problems, and Cat's difficult past has been teased heavily as well. Kleypas gives \"Marks\" a poignancy and vulnerability that takes nothing away from her sharp wit and grounded strength. No small feat for an author and Kleypas achieves it with extraordinary finesse. We start and finish the book with the same two characters, both completely recognizable, but at the same time vastly changed. They're a great couple and I could read a whole series about them alone. We get to see most of our favorites, although only for quick glimpses. This book is filled to the brim with Leo and Cat. It's been so nice to watch their relationship evolve since her introduction in Seduce Me at Sunrise. My one small complaint is a typical one for me. After a couple of sex scenes, I'm pretty much done in any book. I feel like they get to be padding. But at least Leo and Cat have a great rapport so they weren't tedious, just perhaps more frequent than I would have advised for the movement of the story. But, whatever. It didn't diminish my enjoyment at all, I just noticed the plethora.And, as usual, the book ends with the reader wishing they could be part of the Hathaway clan as well. Which is a good thing.Can you tell I liked it?PS: Can we get a love interest for Jake Valentine? He's such a sweetie. He's not in this book much at all, but his intro in Harry and Poppy's book made so many of us fall in love with him I know I'm not alone in wanting him suitably companioned."}, {"userName": "Mei", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6876967-mei", "userReview": "[why Marks didn't accept Leo's proposal sooner?

Jealousy flares and Cat and Leo share their first kiss. Soon after, Leo returns to London and endeavors to learn everything he can from Harry, Cat's older brother. Upon learning everything he can from Harry, Leo returns to Hampshire where he hopes to get the whole story from Cat.Upon his return, Leo is informed by Amelia that if Leo does not choose a wife and produce an heir within a year, the Hathaways will lose Ramsay house. Faced with this reality, Leo and Cat ride over to the crumbling original estate on the other side of the Ramsay lands. While there, the pair manages to fall through the roof of the estate, and Leo's shoulder is impaled by some wood. Cat gets the two of them out of there and rides him back to Ramsay house so Cam and Merripen can clean the wound. During the ride, Leo confides the story of his past with Laura, and before Cam starts cleaning the wound; Cat and Leo have a moment where she promises not to let him fall back into addiction.That night is when everything changed.After that night, Cat and Leo fought considerably less, despite some arguments, and spent a lot more time around each other than they had previously.When the Hathaway sisters hold a ball for Leo, to which they invite many people especially single women, Catherine comes face to face with her past. Lord Latimer is a perverse man who, eight years ago, paid to keep fifteen year old Catherine as his personal sex object for a year. Luckily, Harry had come to save her before Latimer could do anything. Cat had successfully evaded the pervert for eight years but that all came to an end when he accosted her at the ball. However, Leo comes to the rescue and evicts Latimer from the party and the property.The next day, it is discovered that Catherine has left, with only a note left for the family. Leo goes after her and they spend an amorous night in each others' arms, during which Leo proposes to her. However, she declines, saying she needs to consult with Harry first.After talking to Harry and Poppy about Leo's proposal, Cat is still undecided on what to do, still afraid to trust any man, especially Leo because she knows he can steal her heart. Despite the constant rejections, though, Leo goes through great pains to woo and seduce Catherine. He even goes so far as to incite her jealousy after his visit with Miss Darvin (the girl who, along with her mother, was trying to take Ramsay House) by implying that he might have accepted Vanessa Darvin's proposal of a marriage of convenience. However, he finally admits that he didn't accept because he only wants Cat.A few days later, Cat is kidnapped in the middle of the night. Abducted by the man who worked at her aunt's brothel. Aunt Althea intends to put Catherine to work in the brothel to make up for the money spent on Cat as a child and to make up for her escape from Lord Latimer.After finding out that Latimer had nothing to do with Cat's disappearance, Leo and Harry go to the brothel, as that is the only other viable option. They find her, high as a kite from the opium smoke that fills the building, sitting on a ledge outside the window. They successfully toss a rope to her and Leo tells her he loves her. Before she'll come off the ledge, though, Cat wants him to say it again and why. So before Harry and a house full of prostitutes, Leo professes his love to Catherine. The day, Catherine finally admits her feelings to Leo and accepts his proposal.One year later, Leo is banished from the room that Catherine is giving birth in. After many dreadful hours, Amelia comes to him, holding a beautiful baby girl, who they name Emmaline, and Win holds a gorgeous baby boy, who they name Edward. Beatrix happily tells Leo that he managed to save Ramsay House with one day to spare, but Leo didn't care and raced upstairs to Cat's room, where he takes care of her and promises to love and care for her forever.Even though it was painfully obvious from the previous books that Leo was going to marry Catherine, it was a relief to finally have Leo find someone he could love and appreciate after the desolation he'd lived in since Laura's death. As always, Leo was completely engaging and hysterical in his wit. Also, it was nice to see a softer side of him.I enjoyed finally learning more about Cat, the mysterious Hathaway governess and companion. Through my reading of the previous books, I kind of had an inkling of what her past might have been, but it still broke my heart to read the story of the fifteen year old girl, desperate for freedom, sold into prostitution at such a tender age. Also, it was nice to see different sides of her personality, too, and to see her succumbing to Leo's love, wit, and charm.Harry, my love...I was very happy to see that he was in this book to rather large extent. It's always thrilling to see my Harry!As always, the Hathaways were highly entertaining, and I loved seeing their familial interactions.Once again, Lisa Kleypas has produced a thoroughly enjoyable read and I will definitely be continuing the series with Beatrix's book and will be reading more of LK's books."}, {"userName": "boogenhagen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3794921-boogenhagen", "userReview": "Phew!

Makes Suddenly You's strawberry scene look outright tame in some parts (!) Book 4 in the Hathaways series is still just another alright read. Sure you\u2019ve got the love/hate but it\u2019s a toned down one and yes there\u2019s also some good back and forth banter but it\u2019s just okay with only a few really good lines. This whole series feels like I\u2019ve seen it all before and better somewhere else.Book 3 ended with the Cat/Leo cliffhanger so of course this is their book. The story picks up a short time before the cliffhanger episode so you get the missing background info which was nicely done. Catherine Marks, if you\u2019ve read the previous book you\u2019ll know is the paid companion of the two youngest Hathaway girls. She\u2019s very proper with a mysterious past. Her arch nemesis is the sisters\u2019 brother Leo, Lord Ramsay. He\u2019s a devil may care rake who does everything he can to bait Cat into some argument or other while she never passes over an opportunity to give him a dressing down. Turns out though that the two hate each other on the outside but on the inside harbor a \u201ctendre\u201d for the other. This has the makings of a really great story but for me it was just good. Why? Because Leo was still too nice and something about his character seemed forced and nearly predictable. He had some funny moments with his quick quips smattered around here and there but the depth of emotion that Kleypas gives her heroes (or used to anyway) is missing. Catherine\u2019s starchy character was very well-done. It\u2019s very hard for her to \u201clet loose\u201d especially with Leo but they come together nicely.The needling between the two was at times classic Kleypas but I\u2019d have liked it to continue more. They fell in love too quickly. More tension building was needed. The steam gets cracking right from the get-go which was fine but I was quite surprised at how Kleypas upped the sex. Woo hoo it was getting hot in there between the foreplay, oral sex and \u201cthe deed\u201d itself, just wasn\u2019t expecting that much. It was well-done though and didn\u2019t feel like sex for sex. There\u2019s another annoying caper-like story towards the end, though it\u2019s done better than most authors it still feels like filler. Previous Hathaway family members turn up so you get that family series feel. The epilogue provided a sweet ending too. Something that was weird was that it didn\u2019t have that regency feel \u2013ok it wasn\u2019t a western but the vibe wasn\u2019t there. It almost felt like a generic read at times.Basically it\u2019s another okay 4 star read for an okay-ish series. The story comes together fairly well and flows, the word sparring has it\u2019s moments but the emotion that characterizes Kleypas\u2019 stories is not all there and she\u2019s again churned out just one of many historical romances that doesn\u2019t have all that much flair."}, {"userName": "G\u00f6k\u00e7e", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36014364-g-k-e", "userReview": "15.08.2017Ta\u015f\u0131nmadan dolay\u0131 yeni bir kitaba ba\u015flamak istemiyorum ve kitap okuyas\u0131m vard\u0131.

I liked Married by the Morning, but I\u2019ll admit, I had high expectations for this one. I was really excited for Catherine Mark\u2019s story. She\u2019s the nerdy companion with a secret! I just didn\u2019t see the chemistry between her and Leo. The banter was off the charts good, but I felt like there was too much banter for my taste. Where was the wooing?Leo and Catherine have always had it out for each other. Leo found her odd, but interesting and Catherine has always wanted to be left alone. I liked their characters in the other books because we got a glimpse to their issues. I was curious to what was Catherine\u2019s deal and what was her secret?!I felt like the banter went on too long. Leo kept on making remarks towards Catherine to get a rise out of her and Catherine kept on running away from Leo. She played hard to get a bit too long.

He hauled her forcibly to the pitcher and basin. \u201cStop it,\u201d she screeched, flailing at him, while he pushed her head over the basin and poured water over the lock of her hair she had saturated with dye. She spluttered furiously. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? What are you doing?\u201d\u201dHe subdued her without effort, pinning her wrists, her torso, as if she had no more substance than a garment rippling on a clothesline.\u201dAsshole.Catherine is, unsurprisingly, A Different Type Of Woman. Only she, amongst all the lying whores and idiots of her sex, can tempt him to fidelity and marriage. She\u2019s an unusual, beautiful woman in hiding. The only woman who can change him. Obviously.The problem is, as ever, I am not convinced he deserves her. The back half of the book is sort of odd. Our H/h are doing everything to act like a couple but agreeing to be together. The hero is aggressively pursuing the heroine, determined to have her and the heroine is pushing him away, except when she\u2019s not, which seems to be most of the time. It all felt a bit pointless, but irritated me less than the first half with the set up of their characters and romance.Usually a DNF is a one-star rating for me, but I\u2019m giving this two stars, because the sex was well-written.And with this, I think Ms Kleypas and I might have to part ways. I think I can conclusively say she's Not For Me. This book has a 4 star+ rating and 20k+ reads, so I'm sure she'll survive this blow to her career."}], "description": "Sudah dua tahun Catherine Marks bekerja sebagai pendamping gadis-gadis Hathaway.
