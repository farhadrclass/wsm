I would have thrown it against a wall but 1) it was a library book and 2) it's pretty fat, so it would have left a dent. I'm sure people who like magical realism will adore this book, but I thought it was goopy and annoying. Just as I'd become interested in a \"real\" character, some random dead person would appear and the author would waste five pages on a lot of woo-woo philosophizing about the dead and their opinions. Dead people, apparently, do not want us to sweat the small stuff!

At the core, this book is a family drama, in which 3 vaguely dysfunctional adult siblings try to make their way in the world after the bizarre deaths of both of their parents (Mom: sucked up in a tornado; Dad: struck by lightning). I loved this book when it focused on these characters.But the author was trying to do more than just tell the story of these people. She was trying to tell the story of an odd little Welsh town in Nebraska (what does it mean to be \"home?\"). She was also trying to offer a version of what-happens-after-you-die (some sections are told from the point of view of dead people). There's just too much of everything here -- too much description, too much quirkiness, too many storylines, and too many pages (540)."}, {"userName": "Kendra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/436583-kendra", "userReview": "It took me a while to get into this book, but once I did, I was hooked. Kallos is a good writer, and one of her strengths is her subtle, intelligent humor. I really liked, too, how she feeds you a little bit of information at a time and makes you wait till the end of the book to get the whole story about this odd family and even odder town. For me, the biggest drawback was the terrible editing. There were lots of typos (\"acamedician\" was a standout among the more mundane misspellings) and odd mistakes (\"Princess Leah\" instead of \"Leia\" more than once). The author also repeatedly described children doing developmentally inappropriate things and made me wonder if she's ever been around children at all (e.g., she had a 6-week-old sitting up in a high chair and eating food, a 4-month-old playing alone in a kitchen and rearranging cabinets, and 2 kids under the age of 2 entertaining themselves outside without supervision). Nitpicky? Yes, but I can't help it -- those things really distract me."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1449685-stephanie", "userReview": "This book rocked my world.

In like the second chapter, a minor character, Kris, is introduced. Just a few paragraphs later, and from then on, the same character is referred to as \"Chris\". Why why why would no one have caught this? I am only reading on because of all the other great reviews that promise a terrific story... Grrr!... So I finished the book, but the editorial errors continued. For example, the stage is set for 1977, when Larken is 14 and going to get her driver's permit early. But a few sentences later, the author says something to the effect that Larken needed to be able to drive in 1997 because her mother could not. Hello? Also, after her father dies, Larken is supposed to be settling up some of his affairs. Fair enough. However, the author explains that Larken is the one who has to do these things because she is her father's power of attorney. With very little research (and perhaps just a small poll of relatives or neighbors), you could find out that power of attorney is valid only while the individual is alive. Once you die, your power of attorney is void, and wishes must be carried out by an executor of the estate, or someone else named in a will. Being from Nebraska, I know that her other references to the area are spot-on, so I am disappointed that these details are so incorrect."}, {"userName": "Kathrina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2569242-kathrina", "userReview": "It's been a long time since I've felt so close to what I begrudgingly must admit are fictional characters. And I don't mean that these characters felt like friends or neighbors, but that each of them was a part of me, and their story on the page was a piece of my story I hadn't yet considered. Kallos' writing is stunning -- poetically lush and sharp at the same time. Beware, there is magic realism here; the dead will speak, but it only makes the voices of the living more distinct. This story has so much to tell you, and your listening will be rewarded. Symbols! So many symbols and recurring themes - symbols are symbols -- kite strings, wooden dice, chairs/wheelchairs/bicycle seats, the shape of rain drops, the shapes of written language (English, Welsh, Hebrew), mousetraps, pianos, love spoons, grocery lists. Read this as a librarian would and consider the themes of archiving, censorship, information technology, when we share information and when we don't. So much is here. And singing. Beautiful, unselfconscious singing, rising and falling, inspiration and expiration, inflation and deflation, up and down, breath."}, {"userName": "RNOCEAN", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1874870-rnocean", "userReview": "Sing Them Home is a moving portrait of three siblings who have lived in the shadow of unresolved grief since their mother\u2019s disappearance when they were children.

There are very few authors, and only Barbara Kinsolver comes to mind, whose work is so consistently amazing that it is, indeed, like falling in love to read their work. Fresh writing, still fresh.

The only part I really enjoyed was reading the entries in Hope's journal right up to the time of her disappearance.

Hope was swept up, along with her Singer sewing machine and a Steinway piano, but she never came down. Due to the absence of her remains, all that stands in the graveyard is her cenotaph.Twenty-five years later, the three grown-up children are still trying to cope with their grief. None ever married. Larkin, an art history professor (whose work is symbolic with her loss and grief) hides behind food and refuses to \"leave the ground.\" Gaelan is a weatherman (ah! the irony) who has only superficial, sexual relationships with women, and the youngest, Bonnie, is a virgin and garbologist. She roams after storms to look for \"archival\" remains of things that flew away in the tornado with their mother. And she talks to the dead at the cemetery.There is also a beloved but inscrutable stepmother, Viney, (although she never legally married their dad); a large supporting cast of unforgettable characters; ancestral Welsh traditions; and the Nebraska weather and topography, a salient ingredient in pulling the story together.The prose is beautiful and evocative as the story moves along non-linearly, but with grace. Past events are revealed gradually and build momentum as it catches up to the present. You will experience an intimate relationship with these radiant, unconventional characters and their extraordinary story.There are some themes similar to The Lovely Bones--loss, unresolved grief, isolation, the meaning of memories and the idea of home. However, Kallos' novel is richer, more sprawling and textured. John Irving comes to mind, with veins of Philip Roth, Margot Livesy, and Ann Tyler. She is an original, though--she leaves her own memorable imprint.This is no garden-variety redemption story. It exhilarates with an elixir of spiritual, metaphysical and deeply human voices, of things said, unsaid, unuttered, and forever sung.For a taste of the author's wit, poise, sensibility, and charm, read her bio on her website at www.stephaniekallos.com"}, {"userName": "jillian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81376-jillian", "userReview": "This book was absolutely beautiful. I loved every single page of it. The characters were so vivid, the prose so gorgeous, the setting so lovingly described...it is a true classic.When Hope Jones goes up in a tornado in 1978, it gives her children no way to let go of her. Without a body, they, and the town, cannot perform the traditional days of grieving and singing that they have inherited as part of their Welsh lineage. While those rituals help with loss for everyone else, without a body for Hope, they cannot take place...and the three Jones children remain unsettled and unable to move forward with the love they need in their lives. This book was about so much. First of all, it was about love: the love that a mother holds for her children, the love of a community for the land and people that make it up, the love of family for each other, the love of husband and wife. It was about all the ways that people express that love, and about how much it matters. \"Sing Them Home\" is also set in Nebraska, in Tornado Alley. It is written by a Pacific Northwesterner, with the Seattleite's fascination with the small towns of the prairie. And I also wondered, are their towns like Emlyn Springs, towns that have held onto their original European heritage for hundreds of years, to the point where they speak their ancestral language and follow the traditions and consider it part of their very being? Is that how history is preserved, not with the history books, but by the keeping of the everyday, even when its transplanted and modified slightly?This book is a true joy to read. I really think almost anyone could enjoy it. I loved it so much that I was re-reading it on a plane home from NYC last week, which is where I think it still is. I hope it turns up soon so I can return it to the LAPL and let someone else experience Kallos' creation."}, {"userName": "Manik Sukoco", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44105134-manik-sukoco", "userReview": "I loved this book! It is a beautifully written story of one family and one Welsh Town in Southeastern Nebraska. We are taken through the life of Hope and Llwellyn Jones and their three children, Larken, Gaelan and Bonnie. This is also the story of Vinie (the children's stepmother) yet she never really married their father.The couple marry in the early 1960's and settle down in his hometown of Emlyn Springs, Nebraska. It is a town that honors all their Welsh traditions and Hope falls in love with the town as a young woman. Llwellyn is a Doctor and Hope a stay at home mom, who suffers several miscarriages before giving birth to 3 children.Through excerpts from Hope's diary throughout the book we learn of her feelings as she goes through these losses and tries to adapt to and fit in to this very \"set in its ways\" small town. At the same time we are taken through present day (2004) and the lives of Larken, Gaelan, Bonnie and Vinie.Llwellyn is struck down and killed by lightning in 2004 and from that point on we learn the details of the life he has had. We learn that Hope was diagnosed with MS and that she was \"taken up\" during a tornado in 1978.This is such a dynamic book, I highly recommend it. I had trouble getting to sleep at night worrying about these people and couldn't wait to get back to the book the next day. All the characters of this book display humanity that we all have.

His three adult children -- all of whom are quirky and unusual, perhaps due to the mysterious disappearance of their mother during a tornado when they were children -- come home to mourn him and to reconnect with their past. The setting is the small town of Emlyn Springs, Nebraska, a town founed by Welsh settlers, which has held firmly to its Welsh heritage. Much of the story is told either in flashbacks or with excerpts from their mother's diary.Some reviewers have called this a novel of magical realism; if it is, it's more realistic than magical, though there are mysteries.Lots of metaphors: singing, light/vision/blindness, mystery, weather.

Each sibling has his/her own complex and intriguing story, as well as a part in the family's tragic past. You see, their mother, Hope, was blown away in the tornado of 1978, never to be seen again. Everyone assumes that she is dead, but no evidence exists to prove it.As the siblings come together, their lives start to unravel. It is as though tragedy follows them.

Kallos tries to follow each sibling as they deal with issues surrounding their childhood, and look for love in their present lives. And for the most part she succeeds in fleshing out these characters until the end, when suddenly it wraps up neater than a birthday package.

The oldest, Larken Jones is an overweight art professor hiding her eating disorder from everyone. Perpetually single but in love with her married neighbor. She's just existing from day to day not really living at all. The middle child, Gaelan is an overly sensitive and good looking body-building weatherman who uses women and discards them (or they discard him). I got the feeling he might be gay and hiding it from everyone including himself. (I was surprisingly wrong about this.) And of course, the youngest, Bonnie who is an anomaly. She collects trash in an effort to find a clue to her mother's disappearance. She basically lives in a shack with all this junk as decoration. She is very civic-minded: mowing old ladies lawns, going to the school to help with the kids, attending town meetings, etc. She's rather odd but perfectly content. The story is very disconcerting because it jumps back and forth in time. When any of the children are traveling, the story regresses (without notice) to an earlier time in their lives. Then jumps back to the place in time they actually are. The most disconcerting this is that Hope Jones (their mother) isn't part of the story at all. By the time the story starts, she has already \"gone up\" as they refer to her death. So you don't get a feel for her or of her personality. The only way you \"know\" Hope is through her diary entries and they don't show her in the best light. Unfortunately, I found Hope to be whiny and irritating as hell. I just couldn't find it in myself to like her at all and I became rather uninterested in reading (listening) to her constant diatribe. This is not usually something I would read but I needed a book set in Nebraska and this is all I could find that I was even willing to read. Thankfully I found an audiobook otherwise I never would have gotten past the first chapter. Though in a hard copy I could have easily skipped over all the stuff that happened once Llewlyn Jones died instead of having to endure all the Welsh singing and the morbidity of the weekly death extravaganza. Where one description would suffice, the author repeatedly used three.

Not like zombies or in the way that stories usually have dead characters in a book, where living characters have memories of them or readers are taken back in time to see them when they were alive. The dead in this book are dead, but have active \"lives,\" spiritually hanging around the cemetery, traveling around the world, keeping an eye on the living in their small Nebraska town, commenting on the smart or stupid behaviors of the living, and generally functioning a bit like an off-stage Greek chorus. As Kallos notes on the first page, \"It's so hard to explain what the dead really want.\"And in addition to watching the development of and interactions between the three main sibling characters, their dead mother, and their widowed stepmother, I greatly enjoyed learning more about Welsh culture, as that is a small percentage of my own ethnicity about which I know virtually nothing. The importance of music and singing, the rites and rituals around death and grieving, the food and \"fancy eggs,\" the strictures and supports of faith, the expectations and loyalty of family: these pieces of Welsh life maintained by Americanized descendants in small-town, rural Nebraska are made palpable through Kallos's depiction of Emlyn Springs and its residents. I am trying to understand some of the author's choices as well, especially why we are rarely, if ever, given a scene or chapter from the perspective of Llewellyn, the dead father of the adult siblings who are the main focus of the book. He is seen through the eyes and memories of other characters, often honorable and hard-working as a physician and mayor, yet also duplicitous, neglectful, and betraying as a father and husband. It is difficult to understand his motivations and actions without having his perspective, but I suppose this is true of many of the people whom we meet in real life, even in our own families."}, {"userName": "Kathy McC", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237166-kathy-mcc", "userReview": "I really don't know about this book. I guess I liked it because of the characters that are unusual and well defined. But, I like a riveting plot and there was no overall plot. There were the subplots that involved each of the 4 main characters, but there really was not a larger \"scheme of things\". I also felt like after all the sadness and dysfunction in the lives of the characters, Kallos felt like she had to bring us into the sunlight so she provided a quickly and neatly wrapped happy ending. She takes 500 pages to tell the story then wraps it up in less than 100. Parts of this novel had dead people conversing with each other, so it seemed like fantasy. Other parts were in diary form, so it seemed like a fictional memoir. Then there were sections of realistic fiction. But I never got a handle on the point nor the genre. I probably should have given it two stars, but the characters were people that you could carry with you, if not in your heart, than at the least in your brain. Three siblings with very dysfunctional lives. The bizarre traits of each were caused in large part by the disappearance of their mother when they were young. She was carried away by a tornado. Their father was later killed by a bolt of lightening. These characters are richly developed and highly creative. From the mother's diary, \"Erasure that's what I long for. If I leave nothing of myself behind, mightn't I lessen their grief? I don't want them remembering me with the assist of scrapbooks or photo albums. I want them to carry me with them in the air that they breathe.\" I really can't believe I finished this book. I took the bookmark out of it several times. But, I did want to see what happened to each character."}, {"userName": "Iowa City Public Library", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427891-iowa-city-public-library", "userReview": "The 2011 All Iowa Reads book is Stephanie Kallos\u2018 Sing Them Home. I just listened to this book on disc and thoroughly enjoyed it. I look forward to discussing this book with others as a part of the All Iowa Reads program in 2011!!Sing Them Home is set in the small Welsh community of Emlyn Springs, Nebraska and focuses on the Jones family. Everyone in Emlyn Springs knows the Jones family because their matriarch, Hope Jones, was carried away by a tornado and was never seen again. Hope\u2019s family, including her husband, three children, and best friend, are unable to move on because of the questions surrounding Hope\u2019s disappearance. Hope\u2019s children, Larken, Gaelan, and Bonnie, struggle with identity issues and long for answers about their mother. Excerpts from Hope\u2019s diary are woven into the story to give Hope\u2019s perspective of life in Emlyn Springs as well as insights into her thoughts and character.Sing Them Home offers a strong sense of place and the characters are well developed and memorable. Initially I was unsure about the story (yes, it\u2019s long) but when I got to the end of the book I was sad that it was over. Stephanie Kallos is an excellent writer and weaves an enjoyable story that is warm, sometimes funny, and offers many themes for discussion. ~~Enjoy~~ --KaraFrom ICPL Staff Picks Blog"}], "description": "The eagerly anticipated second novel from the author of Broken for You - a national best seller and selection of the Today Show Book Club - is a sweeping, gorgeously crafted family story set in the American heartland.With her best-selling debut novel, Broken for You, Stephanie Kallos earned comparisons to John Irving, Anne Tyler, Margaret Atwood, and Carol Shields, establishing her as a writer of uncommon \u201cwisdom and soulfulness\u201d (Sue Monk Kidd). Sing Them Home is a deeply moving portrait of three grown siblings who have lived in the shadow of unresolved grief since their mother\u2019s mysterious disappearance when they were children. Everyone in Emlyn Springs, Nebraska, knows the story of Hope Jones, the physician\u2019s wife whose big dreams for their tiny town were lost along with her in the tornado of 1978. For Hope\u2019s three young children, the stability of life with their distant, preoccupied father, and with Viney, their mother\u2019s spitfire best friend, is no match for their mother\u2019s absence. Larken, the eldest, is an art history professor who seeks in food an answer to a less tangible hunger; Gaelan, the only son, is a telegenic weatherman who devotes his life to predicting the unpredictable and whose profession, and all too much more, depend on his sculpted frame and ready smile; and Bonnie, the baby of the family is a self-proclaimed archivist who combs the roadsides for clues to her mother\u2019s legacy, and permission to move on. When, decades after their mother\u2019s disappearance, they are summoned home after their father\u2019s sudden death, they are forced to revisit the childhood tragedy at the center of their lives. With breathtaking lyricism, wisdom, and humor, Stephanie Kallos explores the consequences of protecting the ones we love. Sing Them Home is a magnificent tapestry of lives connected and undone by tragedy, lives poised\u2014unbeknownst to the characters themselves\u2014for redemption.", "title": "Sing Them Home", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96703.Sing_Them_Home", "average": 3.55, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328774631l/96703.jpg", "reviews": 677, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/55630.Stephanie_Kallos", "name": "Stephanie Kallos"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Audiobook", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96703.Sing_Them_Home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6434332-sing-them-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3162482-sing-them-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6130901-sing-them-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96702.Broken_for_You", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22749699-language-arts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35239185-language-arts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39103117-destro-ada", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11100623-hotel-angeline"]}
