People will tell you this book about Haiti -- about another lightning rod that divides asunder: class. It is about these things. It's about many other things, also. Depending on who you are, you may need a trigger warning, a stiff drink, a shower when you're reading (and after). I just needed silence. And then I needed to talk. A lot. Not about the book, but about a ton of things I'd been bottling up. For me, this book was a call to action. It demands that you speak up.For me, An Untamed State is about what a woman absorbs. It's about the things she keeps quiet to protect those she most ferociously loves. It's about a willingness to die and come back from the dead, to run and be brave enough to return. Mireille emerges from 13 days of unimaginable, horrifying captivity (one captive woman, seven men. Whatever you're imagining, multiply it.) unable to ever reclaim the relatively benign, content life she had before. But in truth, before, the silences she kept and the fears were their own captivity. After, she was freer, her contentment deeper in many ways, and her loyalties, concerns, and communication more intentional. There is something about surviving. It renders polite, protective silences completely futile, entirely absurd. And the people you need to become who you are need to be able to hear you scream. Read this book, if you can. It will be difficult for sexual abuse survivors. Very difficult. But, should you be able to bear it, it will be a very important text."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "Favorite Book of the YearToday I noticed a weird bruise on my finger. After talking myself down from a leukemia diagnosis, I finally figured out it was a Kindle-related injury. I had gripped my Kindle so hard while reading An Untamed State that I bruised my finger. That\u2019s how powerful this book is\u2014it can cause bruises! Puts a whole new meaning to the phrase, \u201cthis book is gripping!\u201dTo quote another reviewer, what a mother-fucking masterpiece! The book grabs you immediately, and with each chapter tightens its grip on your time, your soul, your life (and your finger).A young, rich Haitian woman named Mireille is kidnapped by a gang of men (one who is particularly sadistic) and is relentlessly raped and tortured for 13 days. The crimes they commit against her body become crimes against her mind and soul. She is surrounded by people who have morphed into animals, and she becomes an animal herself, her senses all finely tuned to impending danger from her predators. Gay describes what they are doing to Mireille in graphic detail at first, but soon after, she just hints at the specific atrocities. Gay leaves us to imagine the acts of violence without making us read about them; she spares us the gory details. Much appreciated, Roxane Gay.I\u2019m not a masochist or a voyeur. I don\u2019t enjoy the horror of it all, but the story is so riveting I can\u2019t stop reading. I want to, need to, see what happens. Gay makes Mireille pop off the page and land in our heart and soul. How in the hell does she pull that off? Mireille seems so real, so vivid, I have trouble remembering that this is a story, that this is make-believe, that this didn\u2019t really happen. I want to be there for her. BE there for her? Christ, Debbie, she does not exist!! Get a grip (we know I have one). But such is the greatness of this portrayal.The book made me think about how I would act if I were being tortured. Would I beg for mercy or would I stay strong, just so the torturers didn\u2019t know how much they were breaking me? Mireille runs the gamut of reactions and emotions, and we squirm uncomfortably as her torturers take her, and us, to evil places we don\u2019t want to know about, let alone experience.In those 13 days of hell, Mireille reflects on the \u201cBefore,\u201d so we learn about the idyllic life she had been living with her husband and young child. This back and forth between the calm, happy days and the unbearably painful and terrifying present works beautifully both structurally and emotionally. Just when we can\u2019t take any more, we\u2019re taken out of the fire and put into the sunny peace of the Before. When it\u2019s all over, the terrible \u201cAfter\u201d begins, which is its own kind of hell. The After is just as intense, as Mireille tries to find the self of Before. When you enter the After with Mireille, you stay right with her as she flails through her personal hell. I believed every word, every one of her wails, every step that she took to try to escape from herself.Three small things bothered me (which I hate to even bring up because this is a 10-star book in my opinion). One, I didn\u2019t think her husband, Michael, was an asshole, like all the characters do. He didn\u2019t really handle everything properly, but it was clear that he loved Mireille unconditionally. He didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014who would? So I guess I would have liked Gay either to make him seem like a worse guy, or to not make the characters so mad at him.The second thing\u2014I wanted better revenge on the animals who did this to her. I know this is politically incorrect, but it\u2019s true. I wanted them to be hurt. I wanted them to feel pain.The third issue has to do with the book\u2019s incredibly great intro sentence:\u201cOnce upon a time, in a far-off land, I was kidnapped by a gang of fearless yet terrified young men with so much impossible hope beating inside their bodies it burned their very skin and strengthened their will right through their bones. They held me captive for thirteen days. They wanted to break me. It was not personal. I was not broken. This is what I tell myself.\u201dI have trouble believing that Mireille would call her kidnappers \u201cterrified.\u201d I am not big enough to cut them any slack, to provide any excuses for their crimes, and I have trouble believing that Mireille would be able to either. I don\u2019t want to understand the kidnappers; their crimes are inexcusable and unforgiveable. Would Mireille really be able to say that they were terrified, after the torture she experienced?Two things are sure after finishing this book: I will never go to Haiti, and I will never look at PTSD in the same way. In my Before (the time before I read An Untamed State), I occasionally said things like \u201cOh, her PTSD is kicking in\u201d when a friend got a little pissed off and I knew she had had a bad childhood. A marginally deprived childhood and a little anger is not what PTSD is about. It\u2019s about someone enduring something so traumatic there is no possible way for us to understand it. People with PTSD lose a part of themselves that is never recoverable. After innocence about the goodness of the world is lost, it is gone gone gone. I\u2019m in awe of anyone who can function with any semblance of normalcy after enduring unimaginable torture. I will never again talk lightly about PTSD. I\u2019ve always felt horrible for a person who has PTSD, but after reading this book, I feel like crying when I think of someone being tortured and having to live with the memories.The book is absolutely beautiful. Seriously, I don\u2019t even have one editing nit. The book never lets up. I was a hostage, too. But there was no ransom. Only the joy of being held in the heart of this amazing piece of art. What a book. Oh what a book. I would give this 10 stars if I could. Favorite book of the year, maybe even favorite book ever. Hands down."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7240219-holly", "userReview": "Disappointing read. Powerful subject matter reduced to Lifetime movie-worthy prose. Gay has a need to make every line a grand pronouncement, every scene worthy of a Tumblr \"like.\" I found the book to be very emotionally manipulative (along the lines of a Nicholas Sparks novel). I hope no one confuses what I'm saying as a critique of emotions pursuant to kidnapping, or rape, or PTSD, or Miri's feelings about the horror she went through. I have no qualms with any of that. I am taking issue with the way Gay put all of this down on paper.All we read were Miri's (jusifiable) feelings, in the moment, on her treatment and abuse. I wanted to see how Miri worked through it, really worked through it\u2014emotionally. Gay relied far too much on dramatic, action-packed scenes\u2014grabbing keys and sprinting away from the house and driving across the country (her purse and everything she needed magically appearing), running away through cornstalks, melodramatically rejecting Michael x10\u2014and stark, repetitive phrases used so often and thrown around so haphazardly that they were almost superficial: \"I am dead.\" \"I do not want anything in my body.\" \"I am dirty.\" The all-knowing deity Lorraine, who somehow understands everything Miri went through perfectly despite being characterized as a gruff, insensitive person the entire first half. But ok, we know how what she has gone through causes Miri to act and the things it causes her to say. For all of the time spent on Miri's actions and reactions, I never came out feeling like I understood how Miri felt, abstractly. We didn't get to see her work through anything, not really. Time passes. She reacts to things. She's still at the farm. Fast forward to going back to Haiti.Adding to that, Michael and Miri were an unlikable, childish couple I found myself rooting against. I simply didn't believe in them. Couples fight; couples bicker; couples don't always see eye to eye. But there's a difference between difficult love and immature love. Miri is constantly actually throwing things, while Michael is constantly making rude, childish, and tactless remarks without any remorse or self-awareness. There was no romance or depth to the relationship. Sure, Gay can write a convincing sex scene. But so what?An Untamed State is not a novel of privilege as it claims to be in numerous blurbs. Miri rarely even dwells on the subject for longer than a paragraph past a brief acknowledgement of how different she is from her captors and the majority of the Haitian population. I find it very manipulative to have billed the novel this way, and frankly, it kind of pisses me off. I was supremely more interested in reading the novel in the first place because of my interest in the privilege aspect.One nitpick. I am attorney, and I have worked at an immigration law firm. You do not get rich off immigration law. You certainly don't get a bunch of glamour and big fancy houses and nannies from practicing immigration law. You extra-certainly can't abandon your cases for six months. Maybe Michael was the one raking it in so that they could have all those nice things, but the implication was that Miri made a lot of money.This is almost scary to post among the overwhelming praise, but I feel how I feel. I enjoyed the book as a read, went through it fairly quickly, would have loved the ending if it didn't directly contradict everything we had just read about Miri's feelings of hopelessness. Everything isn't a grand pronouncement in life, not all the time. This book would have benefited from a softer hand and a better grasp on the subtleties that accompany trauma."}, {"userName": "Crumb", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53025065-crumb", "userReview": "A profound and heart-achingly beautiful novel about one woman's journey through hell and back..I have to start off by saying that this book is not for everyone. There are graphic, sexual assault scenes that could be triggering for certain individuals. This book takes place in Haiti and it details a woman\u2019s experience in captivity. In the beginning of the book, Gay sets a dark overtone for the reader immediately. The protagonist, Miri is dragged out of her car by armed men directly in front of her husband and child. Her captors notify Miri\u2019s father that ransom is 1,000,000 U.S. dollars and that is final. Miri\u2019s father is a man of great pride and doesn\u2019t want to negotiate with \"animals\", thus refusing to pay his daughter's ransom. Thus begins Miri\u2019s thirteen day imprisonment.Although I gave this book five stars, it was not an easy read for me. There were moments where I needed to take a break. Then there were also moments in which I completely devoured it. Gay is skilled at balancing the narrative of the kidnapping with the narrative of Miri\u2019s past life. As a reader, I was concerned that the whole book was going to be about Miri\u2019s struggle in captivity. Let me tell you, it wasn\u2019t. We learn about Miri\u2019s childhood. We also learn about how she met her husband, Michael. In addition, we come to find out that she wasn\u2019t accepted by her in-laws initially, because of the color of her skin. In Haiti, kidnapping is apparently part of the culture. It is accepted. Isn't that revolting? I was also disgusted by the way Miri\u2019s father handled the kidnapping. It made me infuriated. What father allows their baby daughter to be held captive, aware that there is a way to stop the nightmare, yet refuses? To me, that was the ultimate tragedy of this novel. The amount of violations and assaults on Miri's body could have been reduced, had her father paid the ransom when it was requested.The unexpected relationship that Miri cultivated with her mother-in-law, Lorraine, almost moved me to tears. After Miri had been released from her captors, she stayed with her mother-in-law. Miri had so much rage built up inside of her and the beginning symptoms of PTSD that she felt safer with Lorraine rather than her husband, for obvious reasons. The relationship that developed between these two women was unexpected and so touching.As mentioned, this was by no means an easy read, however it was a powerful read. Gay wrote about the dehumanization of the human spirit, and she did so with poise and sensitivity. Admittedly, there were times where I was extremely uncomfortable, as a woman, reading this novel. During Miri\u2019s entrapment, we see her strength falter and crumble, however we also see her incredible courage and resilience in the face of inscrutable fear. As a result of reading this book, I realize that the resilience of the human spirit can not and should not be underestimated.. Highly, highly recommended.. This book is a testament to the strength and courage that all women are capable of.For an Interview  with Roxane Gay on an Untamed State, please click on the link.In addition, this book is going to be made into a film!

[once again, I love Robin Miles: terrific narrator]Mireille's father left the island of Haiti with nothing and returned with everything..... a wife, children, and wealth. It was easy for her father to overlook Haiti's painful truths- a country of poverty, corruption, heat...and even the gossip of how everyone was into everyone else's business. Mireille's mother remembered--she was resistant to return to Haiti. However, Mireille's mother followed her husband's dreams, making his more important than considering having any of her own. It wasn't until Mireille was is taken away from her own husband and child that she realized they were all going to pay the price for her father's dreams. I thought back to this moment many times trying to figure out -- what does Mireille mean exactly? It was a question I sat with and continued to haunt me. Mireille, Haitian American, is kidnapped by a gang of armed men in broad daylight - \"caged\" for thirteen days. There are scenes in this book that are excruciating disturbing and horrifying intense!! I actually finish this book about two weeks ago- wasn't ready to write about it. Now I can't stop thinking Haiti ( and the fear for Florida this weekend)...and the effects Hurricane Irma. Haiti couldn't have handle a category 5. They seemed to have escaped the worse of Hurricane Irma but flooding still continues. With a pit in my stomach around Hurricane Irma - it's hard to think of anything else this weekend - with our own daughter just 3 miles away from a zone that had a mandatory evacuation yesterday. At the same time:I admire Roxanne Gay. This was her *1st* novel - not without flaws - but written with purpose and heart.

Torture, rape and pain surround this woman so that she refuses to admit who she is anymore. That woman died to her. This book is not for everyone. I do admit that, but it's a powerful read if you can get through it. Mireille is a strong character and she is tough to the point where I cheered for her even when I was crying.

But what I got instead was a Lifetime movie of the week. (There's certainly nothing wrong with Lifetime movies if you know that's what to expect). Chapters alternated between the present day kidnapping and flashbacks to the past, mostly telling the tale of when Mireille and her husband met and married. The scenes with the kidnappers were brutal and graphic, and totally incongruent with the chapters that dealt with the romance backstory. The dialogue and actions between Mireille and her boyfriend/husband were extremely cringe-worthy and juvenile in tone, not what one expects from two adult professionals.

I was excited because I was already familiar with Roxane Gay's writing (fiction & nonfiction), had read Ayiti, and was already a fan. I want to say honestly that this book rattled me. I cried through the last 1/3 and after finishing I was awake for several hours thinking about it. Few books do this for me. I took copious notes while I read. As a reader, I was fully engaged with this story all throughout. Fully there with Mireille and the other characters. This is not an easy read by any means, but it's an important one. It's one of those books I find myself saying to people, \"You have to read this.\"Here is how it opens:\" Once upon a time, in a far-off land, I was kidnapped by a gang of fearless yet terrified young men with so much impossible hope beating inside their bodies it burned their very skin and strengthened their will right through their bones.\"I'm going to try not to be effusive here because I know sometimes effusive review turn me off, and probably others, but holy shit what a fantastic opening line. It made me gasp, because hear the wisdom and empathy and pain in it. The complexity of that one sentence. Also, one theme that has fascinated me all my life is this idea of \"the before\" and \"the after\" when a life or lives are tragically changed by one horrific event. This book explores this theme in depth The first half telling the story of Mireille's kidnapping, with some chapters from her first person point of view and other chapters told in third person, giving us her husband Michael's point of view. Throughout her captivity, Mireille remembers her life \"before\" and this informs and illuminates exactly what price has been paid and also gives the reader a good idea of who she is and how she came to be the woman she is. The second half of the book deals with the \"after.\" Mireille suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, is physically and emotionally broken, and is basically fighting for her life, the life she shared with Michael and their young son. The trauma has completely changed who she is. I appreciated Gay's honest portrayal of this. There are so many times in this novel where it would have been easier to steer the story in an easier direction for the reader's sake, to make things more comfortable, but it wouldn't have been honest. Mirelle herself is not an easy person. Gay does an excellent job of developing all the characters in this book, but particularly Mireille who is intelligent, complex, honest, stubborn and by her own admission, has a hard time loving and being loved. She is also deeply kind. Her captivity challenges her in ways she'd never been before. Her various methods of getting herself through the ordeal are so searingly honest and heartbreaking it truly is hard to watch unfold. There is the sense for the reader of being right there in this with her, right inside her head, and it's devastating. I will say that the second half of the book, for me, is stronger. The writing becomes more fluid and deep. I felt at times that aspects of the kidnapping story fell a bit into well-worn territory, such as the main villain having a scar on his face as villains seem required to have. I also felt some of the flashbacks in the first half of the book went a bit long. I would have preferred those to be shorter and sharper at times. One section of flashback contained within it two additional flashbacks and I found myself getting impatient with those. I could see the necessity for building the backstory, however. Particularly with regards to Mireille's childhood and characterizing her father (a very complex person himself). It's necessary to try to understand her father as he stubbornly refuses to pay her ransom. Mireile's father is himself a deeply complex person. His own story is a tragedy in and of itself as the reader knows this man will have to live with his decisions for the rest of his life. Gay's handling of Mireille's fight to get her life back in the second half of the book is breathtakingly honest. This is a hard, hard road and Gay doesn't flinch from the ugliness or sadness of it. And I don't want to give too much away, but the one person who eventually is able to really help and get through to Mireille is the one person you would not expect and it's perfect. I found myself nodding, often, at the choices made in the telling of this story. I kept thinking, oh there are so many easier ways you could have done this, but they would not have been as honest or had the impact, overall, that the novel has in the end. This is a novel I will continue to think about for a long time. It is astonishingly honest about the plight of women and their strength and vulnerabilities in our world. It also does not offer easy or comforting answers. It is brilliantly and compellingly written. And as I said at the outset, this is not an easy or pretty read, but it's an important one. I cannot recommend it enough."}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "Roxane Gay doesn\u2019t make it easy to recommend her riveting first novel. Set in modern-day Haiti, \u201cAn Untamed State\u201d is the story of an American lawyer who\u2019s kidnapped while visiting her rich parents in Port-au-Prince. For more than 200 pages, she\u2019s beaten, burned, sliced and gang-raped. Owing to the power of Gay\u2019s prose, the immediacy of the narrator\u2019s voice and the graphic nature of this ordeal, it\u2019s some of the most emotionally exhausting material I\u2019ve ever read.I have serious reservations about the over-representation of violence. In this country, it seems to inspire a lot less consternation than the over-representation of sex, but that\u2019s for another day on the couch. Ever since the second President Bush squandered a century of moral progress by making torture stylish again, it seems impossible to watch television without seeing someone getting flayed, drilled or sawed. A few years ago, thrillers about women being tortured to death were showing up so frequently in Book World that we set down a quiet moratorium for a few months. We just needed a chance to catch our breath, wipe down the floor and reflect on what it means to critique and even praise depictions of sexualized brutality.The issue came up in all its complexity last fall while I was serving on the jury for the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. One of the finalists, Bob Shacochis\u2019s \u201cThe Woman Who Lost Her Soul\u201d \u2014 which also takes place largely in Haiti \u2014 is a spectacular exploration of the spiritual and psychological damage of American foreign policy, but it inscribes that damage most vividly on the mind and body of a young woman. To what degree does even the most reproving representation of sexual abuse participate in the visceral thrill and habituate us to such treatment?That question is not easy to resolve \u2014 nor is it irrelevant to Gay, a strikingly fresh cultural critic who will publish a collection of essays in August titled \u201cBad Feminist.\u201d As a Haitian American, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, she\u2019s deeply interested in how values are created \u2014 and by whom. Now, in \u201cAn Untamed State,\u201d she considers questions of class, parental responsibility and especially sex as a weapon of terror in a fantastically exciting novel. There\u2019s just no getting around the fact that the story is horrible, hypnotic and perfectly constructed to frustrate any search for comfort or resolution.The narrator, a young mother named Mireille, knows that she\u2019s a curiosity to her American friends: \u201ca Haitian who is not from the slums or the countryside, a Haitian who has enjoyed a life of privilege.\u201d That privilege makes her just as odd to her Haitian countrymen, who live in unrelenting poverty outside the walls of her parents\u2019 lavish compound. Critically, her father is not a member of the corrupt Haitian aristocracy; he\u2019s a hardworking man who came to the United States with nothing, made his fortune as a builder and returned home to create \u201cthe largest, most successful firm in the country.\u201d But such distinctions between deserved and undeserved wealth are irrelevant to the men who, in the novel\u2019s opening pages, rip Mireille away from her baby and husband and demand $1 million for her release.At first, Mireille imagines that she\u2019s merely being inconvenienced. \u201cKidnapping was a business transaction,\u201d she thinks, \u201cone requiring intense negotiation and, eventually, compromise, but I would be safe. I would be returned to those I love, relatively unharmed. There was ample precedent for hope.\u201dHer calm is short-lived. The story burns along with one terrifying scene after another. Mireille learns that \u201cthere\u2019s no one you can trust in a country run through with anger.\u201d We move from her ordeal at the hands of a gang of insatiable rapists to her parents\u2019 house. There her husband, brilliantly depicted in all his mingled pride and panic, is shocked to learn that his imperious father-in-law has no intention of giving in to the kidnappers\u2019 demands.Gay may be working in territory many American readers know through the lyrical stories of Edwidge Danticat, but her style is wholly her own: direct, bracing and propulsive. Periodically, she suspends this crisis by flashing back to Mireille\u2019s courtship and marriage in the States. It\u2019s the sort of intermittent relief that can feel both frustrating and wholly necessary as we charge through these pages.What responsibilities do the fantastically rich have to their countrymen who have no running water, no food, no health care? Mireille has seen the wretched people surrounding her father\u2019s luxury sedan. She has some vague sense that many low-paid servants must toil so that her family can enjoy \u201cthe comfortable lunacy of . . . a beautiful party on a perfectly groomed beach in the middle of a land of starving people.\u201d Given this crushing inequality, it\u2019s easy to imagine \u201cAn Untamed State\u201d pleading for the moral innocence of desperately poor people who have no options except crime and extortion. Indeed, in the opening paragraph, Mireille tells us, \u201cI was kidnapped by a gang of fearless yet terrified young men with so much impossible hope beating inside their bodies it burned their very skin and strengthened their will right through their bones.\u201dBut the boundless savagery of Mireille\u2019s kidnappers soon makes any kind of sociological apology for their behavior sound obscene. Despite the beatings she receives for talking back, she shreds her captors\u2019 pompous class-warfare cant, refusing to let them imagine that the injustices they\u2019ve suffered absolve them. We\u2019re left not with the tidy explanations of Karl Marx, but the fathomless mystery of evil and what it wreaks on one woman.Betrayed by her country and her father \u2014 even by the very principles of her fairy-tale life \u2014 Mireille must find some way to survive the unsurvivable. \u201cI was becoming,\u201d she tells us, \u201ca woman who could be disgusted by nothing.\u201d Forced into an untamed state of her own, she can get through this trauma only by forgetting her family. \u201cOne by one, I tried to erase each of these memories,\u201d she says. Then her identity drains away, too, and she regards herself as dead \u2014 beyond any further pain. But what future does that leave for her if she\u2019s ever released?That\u2019s the aching challenge that hangs over this smart, searing novel.This review was published in The Washington Post:http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta..."}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "An Untamed State\n Roxane Gay, is an American writer, professor, editor, blogger, and commentatorThe U.S. official Government policy concerning the release of prisoners and demands for ransoms reads:\nThe U.S. Government will make no concessions to terrorists holding official or private U.S. citizens hostage. It will not pay ransom, release prisoners, change its policies, or agree to other acts that might encourage additional terrorism.\nThere's of course a significant difference in the way we think of and define victims of Kidnappings vs. Hostages.Kidnapping is generally done for ransom, whereas hostage-taking is mostly conducted by terrorists organizations looking to get leverage and obtain concessions to their demands.I suspect though that for the victims and the victims's families of either kind of act, these differences might be merely a matter of legal standing and semantics. The thinking behind a State maintaining such a policy, although seemingly lacking compassion, is understandable. But what would you think of a rich businessman who himself maintains a self-imposed ban on paying ransoms, even if the person abducted is his own daughter? Any daughter (or son for that matter) would be naturally inclined to count on her dad's willingness to do everything in his power to keep her out of harm's way. In my book, that includes paying any amount of money he can get his hand into in order to save his daughter's life.The plot of An Untamed State centers around Mireille Duval Jameson, a Haitian-American young woman, whose father is a highly successful construction magnate. After building a mass fortune and raising two American-born daughters in Nebraska, Sebastien has convinced his wife to return to Haiti and enjoy their hard-earned fortune back in their beautiful island nation.\nMy parents spent most of their lives trying to find their way home too. They wanted to return to their island, their people, their food...\nSo this is sort of the immigrant story in reverse, one that most Americans don't often hear about. In reality this is a very typical story for many immigrants (my parents included), people that have come to America, but dream of spending their twilight years back in their home country.Raised as a child of privilege, Mireille has a chip on her shoulder, she can be stubborn, entitled and childish. She's prone to bouts of inexplicable anger and drama. So Gay has given us a character that is very difficult to like or sympathize with. But I think creating Mireille as such a flawed character serves to shed light into the important issue of violence against women worldwide. The moral of the story: This type of violence can happen to any woman regardless of class, age, race, religion, sexual orientation or nationality. You can be the kindest girl or you can be a bitch, it can still happen to you.In her late 20's, Mireille has become a succesful lawyer, she's married to Michael, a mild-mannered Midwesterner, whom she describes as a \"tall, thick-bodied, blond-haired man\". They had settled into a comfortable life in Miami with their beautiful infant son.Mireille and Michael's interracial relationship is one of themes that underlines important contrasts: blacks/whites, rich/ poor, the mind/the body, Haiti beautiful country/ ugly country.The story itself is divided in two parts, \"the before and after\" as our narrator calls it.The \"before\" or the \"Happily Ever After\", starts as Mireille and Michael are in Haiti visiting her parents.On their way to a beach trip, along with their infant son, Christophe, they are surrounded by a gang of armed men, on broad daylight they kidnapped Mireille for ransom, all of this as a beaten and shocked Michael watches in despair.Thus begins a 13-day nightmarish journey, in which Mireille is the subject of unspeakable acts of physical and psychological torture. This is the moment when Mireille's fairy tale is broken forever. I know that many readers have shied away from reading this book because of the very violent and sexual nature of the story, but I would say that my impression was that the author's descriptions and level of detail were necessary in order to convey how horrific Mireille's ordeal truly was. In fact, I found that Gay used an almost detached, analytical tone when describing these scenes, which in itself serves to emphasize the merciless, barbaric treatment she was subjected to. During her captivity, Mireille is kept in a small, hot box. The mastermind behind her kidnapping, is someone we get to know as \"The Commander\", he's a sociopath with a flair for sadistic acts. Throughout her ordeal she's continuously raped by 7 different men and endures all kinds of torture and humiliation. Because she was still nursing her baby when she was kidnapped, this adds yet another layer of both physical and emotional pain. Mireille is not a passive hostage though, she shows a lot of courage and does all she can to fight her abusers. As an American and an immigration lawyer, she seems to have a deep and idealistic sense of justice, but there are times when you want to tell her to stop fighting since her resistance only seems to garner her more cruelty from her captors.Twenty four hours after she's taken captive, The Commander has contacted Sebastien, and puts the price for her release at $1 million dollars, and amount that apparently is not a problem for him to pay, except that as Mireille suspects, her father will not pay the ransom. He's convinced that if he yields to the kidnappers demands they will continue extorting him in the future.So Mireille's body and her chances of survival, become instruments used in a negotiation conducted by selfish, overbearing men.This is a common theme that runs throughout the novel, Mireille's finds that her future and the decisions that affect her life, keep ending up in the hands of men, both those that are supposed to look out for her: her father, husband, doctors, and those that do not.This first part of the novel is interspersed with flashbacks in which we experience the passionate and tumultuous romance between Mireille and Michael. This was to me the weakest part of the novel. I found many of these scenes trite, insipid and terribly redundant. It frankly became too much of a romance novel with too much drama for my taste...The \"after\" part of the novel (called \"Once upon a Time) delves into Mireille's extremely difficult path to find who she is after surviving this terrible ordeal.I thought that this was the most fascinating and best executed part of the story.I am sure you've probably guessed that Mireille's father did eventually paid the ransom and she gets released.But by now, Mireille's body has endured unbelievable levels of physical trauma and like it usually happens, the body heals faster than the mind.The body holds a certain wisdom the mind does not she ponders, early in her detention.The reaction of Mireille's parents immediately after her release, is to pretend that she has already survived the worse of her nightmare . In reality though, her long and painful recovery process has only started.One of the things I learned when I read Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town, is that survivors of sexual assault can experience some of the same psychological symptoms that soldiers diagnosed with PTSD display.Disassociation is a psychological term described as \"a copying mechanism that seeks to master, minimize or tolerate stress. In its more pathological form, dissociation involves fugue and alterations in personal identity or sense of self\".Mireille runs away from everybody that loves her, including Michael and has to literally reprogram her entire life\u2019s outlook in order to survive. She ends up living with Michael's parents for a few months. I absolutely loved Lorraine (Michael's mom) as a character. She showed patience and wisdom in the way she understood Mireille delicate mental condition and provided a welcoming and safe environment for her to recover.Michael is also a great character, there were times when I wondered why in the world did this amazing guy felt in love with this most obnoxious woman!I would've like a happier resolution to the conflict between Mireille and her dad. Somehow I felt that both her parents should've worked harder at getting closer to their daughter.An Untamed State, describes both the conditions of Haiti a beautiful island-nation ravaged by misery and poverty, and Mireille, and the condition she's reduced to after she survives this horrible event.This novel, which I didn't know was drawn from Gay\u2019s own experience with rape, is a challenging read, but I think a necessary one.I don't believe these characters will stay with me for a long time, but overall I thought this was a well written novel.One final thought, if you've been the victim of sexual violence, I believe that this book might triggered difficult memories. Perhaps you might want to reconsidered reading it."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol", "userReview": "The Hook - \u201dOnce upon a time in a far-off land, I was kidnapped by a gang of fearless yet terrified young men with so much impossible hope beating inside their bodies it burned their very skin and strengthened their will right through their bones.\u201dThe Line \u2013 \u201dThe people love a real tragedy when they think it cannot happen to them.The Sinker \u2013 Many young girls look up to their fathers.

Fiction that reads like non-fiction, it pulls no punches of what it means to be privileged in a country where poverty is the norm. In an almost Robin Hood kind of way Mireille becomes the vehicle in a political maneuver of an imbalance of money. When Mireille visits her homeland, Haiti with her son and husband, the family compound behind gates cannot protect her from the reality of a country in economical upheaval. What should have been a leisurely day at the beach ends in Mireille being kidnapped for ransom. It is a brutal telling of a woman with pride and spirit who has been taught to be strong and not fold under the worst circumstances. Whether her strength is an asset or a liability is hard to determine. Each of us will see this in light of our own determination. In Mireille\u2019s case it is her father most of all who has set the tone of her substance.\u201dMy father\u2019s parents both died when he was young, in ways that disgusted him, in ways he once told us, that showed him that the only way to survive this world is by being strong.\u201dBe strong.

So while I wouldn't review this for publication, I'll do so here with that caveat.This was a difficult read, because it is brutal and its brutality is offered in a matter-of-fact way that while anything but superficial is very clear about the surface of things, the physical, painful reality of experience. As a reader I'm more often drawn to the absurd, to fiction a step away from literal reality, and I'll admit I felt myself at first resisting the stark literalness of An Untamed State (I don't mean to say the novel is limited to the literal, just that it doesn't put layers of conceit between story and reader). I found myself initially distracted, even frustrated, by leaving the present action of Mireille's kidnapping and captivity (mention of which is no spoiler) to give background about characters' ordinary lives, marriages and childhoods and illnesses, the familiar things of realist fiction. But the novel quickly showed up those early reactions of mine as privileged resistance to seeing things head-on, my own attempt to define Mireille's story by one part of her life instead of by its totality, as do so many men around her \u2014 and this is very much a story of men trying dictate who and what women are, both with violence and with what those men assume to be kindness.So when I say the novel was a challenge I mean not only the brutality of the story, but the self-reflection it provoked. This was a rare and powerful reading experience indeed, and I'm honored to have played a bit part in its route to publication."}, {"userName": "jo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/210397-jo", "userReview": "this is a brutal and unsparing portrayal of sexual violence. it's also a critique of economic disparity and an angry indictment of patriarchy (which may or may not go hand in hand with economic disparity). a young haitian lawyer, black, married to a handsome nebraskan man (white), with an \u00fcbercute little kid, is kidnapped during her visit to haiti to see her family. kidnapping apparently is the order of the day in haiti at the time (pre-earthquake) and wealthy people expect it and do all they can to prevent it. mireille's family's security measures are not enough and soon the kidnappers are asking for one million american dollars as ransom for mireille. sort of inexplicably, near the beginning of the novel mireille, who narrates the vast majority of the chapters, tells us that her kidnappers were scared young men. this sense of forgiveness, acceptance, or empathy never returns in the novel; nor, frankly, do they seem that scared when we meet them. but there you have it. in all likelihood that kidnapping would have gone off without a hitch and no-one would have gotten hurt if mireille's father had paid straight away. but mireille's father has opinions about how to handle situations like this (it's his first time, but of course he has been preparing for it forever), and decides not to negotiate with the kidnappers. this unleashes in the latter a barrage of sexual violence that goes on, relentlessly, for the entirety of the 13 days of the kidnapping. we are given a really precise sense of what this violence consists of and of what it feels like, and it isn't pretty. in fact, it's barely tolerable. one night, after reading, i found myself shaking and unable to sleep. let's just say that i've never read sexual brutality described with such truthfulness. the only other book that made me equally horrified is Primo Levi's incredible narration of his life in auschwitz in Survival in Auschwitz, aka If This Is a Man. what these two books have in common is their masterful rendition of what it feels like to stop being human. mireille alternates the narrative of what happens to her during her capture with stories of her life with her husband michael and of her pregnancies, only one of which goes to term. the narrative organization is pretty flawless, and while mireille's life before her capture emerges as nice (a lot of emphasis on desire between mireille and michael), there is always, looming, and by necessity, a sense of unease about men and their strange culture. in short, men are brutes who hurt women, michael notwithstanding. and michael is not a sweetie pie. he's a man of few words and he's as hungry for mireille as mireille is for him. given the narrative set up, though, this hunger is uncomfortable to the reader. you'd rather have them make french toast together than fuck intensely, overwhelmed by their love/desire for each other. there is also the fact that michael's nebraskan family, made of farm-owning mom and dad, is none too pleased with michael's marrying someone of a different color, and makes absolutely no mystery of it. this is as painful and uncomfortable to mireille as you'd expect it to be, but michael seems kind of clueless about it. the most powerful parts of the book are about the brutality and the cluelessness of men. the torture scenes are really, really good. roxane gay, who was born in nebraska but is of haitian origin, gives you a clear sense of how easily women turn from human beings to playthings in the hands of men. she gives, it seems to me, no rhyme or reason for this. the playing they are subjected to is fully sexual and fully sadistic, so that if we weren't used to this, if the object of such treatment were, say, animals rather than human beings, we would unquestioningly consider these men psychopaths. as it is, we consider them rapists, a category that is so over-present in all sorts of representational forms, we consider it pretty much natural. so one thing that roxane gay does well here is denaturalize all that, show it for the absolute pathological deadly derangement it is. and we are extremely thankful for the fact that, after having given us a chillingly accurate idea of what these men are doing -- after making sure we get it -- she lets up and simply hints. not that it gets any easier for the reader, but the novel doesn't turn into torture porn one. tiny. bit. which it could easily have done.men's cluelessness is portrayed in all its glory in the aftermath, when mireille is released. the major culprit, of course, is michael -- but then he was clueless from day one. the second part of the book is about post traumatic agony, and there are some pretty brutal scenes (not quite as brutal as the torture scenes, but close) in which michael thinks that the best way to help his wife is to force her to do things she doesn't want to do. as anyone who understand trauma even just a bit knows, forcing someone who's been deprived of her autonomy in the most radical way to do things, even things that are supposedly good for her, is a sure recipe for intolerable retraumatization. eventually respite comes to mirelle (thank god) from some unexpected and lovely place, and we can breathe a little (just a little). two things that left me unhappy at the end: although reformed, michael seems to me to continue being a jerk, understanding his role as mireille's partner only in terms of \"masculine\" protectiveness and bluster. if the book means for that to be the case, and therefore critiques michael, this critique is not made clear at all. the other thing is small but it bugged me all the way through: mireille has two siblings but the second one, a male, is mentioned only at the beginning and never mentioned again. this is strange in a book in which the family and its dynamics are so closely analyzed. if i've missed something, please feel free to let me know in comment. i think roxane gay puts material about nationhood, race, belonging and capitalism in the book, too -- especially about the mayhem that is bound to happen when very rich people live in close proximity to people who are absolutely destitute -- but, frankly, her analysis of gender relations is so bright and stark and powerful, the rest kind of falls by the wayside."},

Were we reading the same book? Honestly this reads more like a Sidney Sheldon novel than the timely sociopolitical thriller I thought it would be. The relationship between Mireille and Michael was immature, one dimensional and unrealistic--much like the characters in this book. And as another reader pointed out was the issue of race and how it was portrayed in such a simplistic, clumsy, and dare say, slavish adoration of the white American male. It felt like a bad 1980s third world fever dream written by a coked out Jerry Bruckheimer. Seriously, I expected Tubbs and Crockett to come busting in any second and save the spoiled brat from her nasty predicament, but no such luck. Because that would of been badass. Not really.

It appears to be a fictionalization of this kidnapping, http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2011-01-... but Gay transforms the mafia kidnappers into leftist militants and brutal rapists. The resulting story is dominantly disavowed BDSM erotica, but it serves also as reactionary propaganda. The title should tip anyone off to the hackneyed neo-colonial comic that's coming: there's nothing even hipster-ironic here to mitigate the reasserted formula -- Haiti = Savage, and must be tamed/civilized by the US empire.Gay cynically uses her purportedly \"feminist\" subject matter of violence against women (the depicted suffering and abuse is offered fairly straightforwardly as entertaining) as cover for her vilification of the revolutionary, courageous, principled, persevering people of Haiti, whom she conjures as archetypal \"chimeres\". At the same time of course Gay delivers the beatification of their comprador exploiter-torturers, portrayed as their generous, innocent victims.The writing is graceless and lazy. An Untamed State is basically YA fiction, a story of a female protagonist abused and 'overcoming the challenges' of recovery, with the plot concocted in accordance with the need to display her struggle through adversity, as if it were an anecdote in a CB psychology textbook. The only thing that distinguishes this novel from YA is the infusion of the challenge-and-prevailing with graphically described rape at such length. (It can serve as an instructive specimen of contemporary schlock trend generally, with more and more children's crap -- comix and fairytales and high school melodramas -- imagined to be made suitable for adults by being stuffed and slathered with dumb explicit violent sex and violence). Scenes of American upper middle class family relations are pasted in from chick flix against a kind of cardboard backdrop spraypainted with \"local color\" signalling the life of the well-to-do in Port au Prince:We sat on one of the teak benches across from my mother. Nadine brought us cold drinks. When my father came home from work, he joined us, performed as he always does for guests, creating from his imagination a Haiti that does not exist, or perhaps once existed and is fading away, a jewel in the middle of an ocean with white beaches and clear blue warm water and a strong, resilient people\u2014a Caribbean Camelot. \u201cI had no idea people lived in such luxury,\u201d Michael said, gripping my hand tightly. It would not be the last time he made that statement. Americans have such strange ideas about the world beyond their borders. After dinner, I stood with my mother on a balcony listening to the mystery of the city around us. \u201cYou love this man.\u201d An unexpected smile spread across my face. I looked down at my hands. \u201cHe\u2019s the only man I\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d Before bed, I kissed Michael good night in the hallway just outside of his room. \u201cCome visit me later,\u201d he whispered. I shook my head and backed away. He refused to let go of my hands until he absolutely had to. I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be a big boy and sleep all by yourself tonight.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll miss me,\u201d he said. \u201cNot as much as you\u2019ll miss me.\u201d Gay, Roxane (2014-05-06). An Untamed State (p. 90). Grove/Atlantic, Inc.. Kindle Edition. Inside this deceptive packaging of the dully familiar and typical, the novel stacks the narrative deck in a way that propagandistically misrepresents the violence and relations of power in Haiti. This charmed sphere of luxury, romance and unsuspected American wholesomeness, it turns out, is surrounded and beseiged by the Untamed: the savagery of the Haitian poor. Gay's fictional Haiti has leapt from the malicious fantasies of Stanley Lucas and Bill Clinton, precisely replicating imperialist mythology https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25Mf7... , with vicious and sadistic \"chimeres\" preying resentfully upon the innocent American do gooder. In the real Haiti, the violence comes from these villas and these Americans, including Haitian Americans. In the real Haiti, the mafia and the police patronized by the ruling elites run kidnapping rings. http://www.haiti-liberte.com/archives... http://haiti-liberte.com/archives/vol... http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2011-01-... In the real Haiti, rape and torture are used by US backed paramilitaries against the poor and Lavalas militants. http://www.haitisolidarity.net/articl... In Gay's fictional Haiti this is all turned upside down. In Gay's fictional Haiti, the poor and Lavalas militants prey sadistically upon profoundly innocent and loveable chick lit heroines from the USA, using radical politics merely as an excuse for misogynistic cruelty and greed. While the real Haiti is the reality of millions of poor Haitians subject to the endless violence of comprador elites, US empire and its MINUSTAH enforcers, Gay's Haiti is the story of a wealthy American envisioned as harmless and pure in her ignorance, who is obsessively desired and sadistically tormented by poor left wing Haitian militants. The result is a kind of 50 Shades of Gray in Haiti lightly disguised as an ordinary, commonplace tale, presented with all the trappings of CNF memoir to create imperialist fable as tortutainment: He stopped, set the knife on the bed next to my ear. The blade was so sharp it hummed eagerly. \u201cYou want mercy?\u201d His voice was drowsy with desire. I never hated him more. \u201cYes, Laurent, I do. Please grant me mercy.\u201d He thought for a moment, rubbing his hand across my stomach. \u201cI will grant you mercy if you do not fight.\u201d I bit my tongue. This was the real sacrifice, my life for my life. I gave him one kind of pain to avoid another. I killed myself to save myself. I would not have survived otherwise. I told him to uncuff me; he did. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders. I kissed his forehead. I died. I kissed his cheekbones, sharp. I died. I told him he was the son of L\u2019Ouverture as I gently grazed his neck with my teeth. I died. I pushed him onto his back and lay on top of him. I bled onto his body, dead but still dying. I pulled his arms around my waist. This was mercy. I pressed my lips to his chest, slid down his body, tracing along his center with my tongue, tasted my blood on his skin. I died. I traced the deeply carved muscles of his trembling thighs with my lips, my fingers, my tongue. I said, \u201cYou shall know kindness even though you have shown me none.\u201d I died. When he said, \u201cI want you now,\u201d I lay on my back. I did not fight. I died. When he said, \u201cLook into my eyes,\u201d I did. I died.Gay, Roxane (2014-05-06). An Untamed State (pp. 363-364). Grove/Atlantic, Inc.. Kindle Edition. The contrast both to real memoirs of torture (eg The Blindfold's Eyes, by Dianna Ortiz) or serious literary treatments of the realities of torture (eg Ariel Dorfmann's play Death and The Maiden), is extreme and instructive. It shows the extent to which Gay's work is fraudulent and cynical, a flimsy tabloid style pulp entertainment in the service of very different-- commerical, exploitative, propagandistic - aims than those the publisher and author cynically deploy to sell it. It should be no surprise to anyone that this book is being endlessly touted by the US press despite its lack of literary quality or even competence as pulp fiction. At a time when the US empire is again returning Haitians to slavery with breathtaking brutality, Gay invites her progressive liberal feminist readers to a violent pornographic daydream about how barbarically the 'untamed' Haitian poor oppress and abuse wealthy innocent Anericans. In this way the novel validates the worst fabrications of war propaganda issued by the US Department of State in the course of its vindictive, ruthless and sadistic policy toward the people of Haiti (a policy amply exposed by Wikileaks cables, and which therefore can not be dismissed as well-intentioned bungling). This supposedly daring, edgy novel is really a mix of lazy sentimental soap opera cliches fashioned as the candy coating for this crude propaganda. It is written with the utmost cynicism, to please a hideous publishing industry that is increasingly dominated by the crassest spectacle of violence and pornography and always ready to promote fiction that somehow works to make even more credible the fictions that are passed off as facts by mendacious imperial journalists of the Murdoch press. Like the proliferating CNF garbage frequently showered with awards (eg the odious Katherine Boo), Gay's novel insists it has a certain purchase on historical human affairs without taking responsibility for factuality and accuracy; it is yet another stupidly titillating narrative that postures as raw honesty (as if inclusion of sexual violence suffices for truthfulness) but is really a colonial fantasy tailored to justify US empire."}, {"userName": "Kevin Fanning", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/178078-kevin-fanning", "userReview": "Just, holy jesus. Destroyed me. \"Unflinching\" is the first most obvious word that comes to mind when you're reading a writer who is so unafraid to write into truly horrifying things. The story is horrifying, unbelievable but so believable, yet told so skillfully that there's never a question of not turning the page, of not finding out what happens next. But as difficult as the story is, it was the tiny little moments of tenderness that broke me. The relationship between Mireille and Lorraine is really one of the most perfect things I've ever read; those were the parts where I had to put the book down. Just for a second though."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3195534-melanie", "userReview": "This is the very disturbing story of a woman (Mireille) kidnapped for ransom in Haiti. The story moves back and forth in time. Mireille tells the story of her kidnapping, her life \"before\" and her life \"after\". There are brutal scenes of rape and torture but it tells the story of Mireille and her husband Michael's love. I did not really \"like\" most of the characters in the book (including Mireille). I found myself getting very frustrated with Mireille in the \"after\" but that being said, I cannot imagine trying to heal from something like this so I really could not help but sympathize with her. I really loved the relationship between Mireille and Lorraine (her mother-in-law). It brought tears to my eyes many times and seemed very realistic. I highly recommend this book BUT not for people who have a hard time reading about sexual brutality and rape."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "Once upon a time, in a far-off land, I was kidnapped by a gang of fearless yet terrified young men with so much impossible hope beating inside their bodies that it burned their very skin and strengthened their will right through their bones.Damn. I read An Untamed State over a period of two weeks, taking in the torturous first half at a snail's pace, speeding through the second half in an emotion-filled haze. The book follows Mirelle Jameson, daughter of one of Haiti's richest sons, wife to Michael, an American man, and mother to Christophe, the couple's newborn son. As Mirelle and Michael enter their car right outside of Mirelle's father's home, a group of men kidnap her. She endures thirteen days of living hell.Roxane Gay fills this book with all the right literary elements. Two aspects that stood out include her raw, vivid prose and the flashbacks she used to provide character depth while breaking away from the main, horrifying narrative. But An Untamed State reaches far deeper than just an ordinary novel with a solid structure. Gay's novel acts as an experience, a book that delves into PTSD and the burdens of women and the unbearable pain of the world we live in. Hope and visceral agony thrum through its pages, as the book centers on the theme of dying every day and still surviving, and fighting, to stay live.Roxane Gay's debut novel reads like nothing else: difficult, honest, heartbreaking, and redemptive. I cannot wait to read more of her work in the future."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11889829-suzanne", "userReview": "2.5 stars. I was looking forward to reading this for quite some time. It wasn\u2019t really \u2018hype\u2019 but I felt an expectation with this one. I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as I\u2019d hoped. I wasn\u2019t fazed with the violence, but I absolutely wasn\u2019t a fan of either of our main players here, Mireille or Michael. I lagged about half way through, and mostly read to finish, not to enjoy.Mireille is a Haitian woman, who\u2019s happy living in Miami with her adoring husband Michael. She is kidnapped outside of her parents mansion in front of her husband and baby son. She endures days and days of abuse in the hand of her violent kidnappers. The abuse she suffers is captured really well, her suffering both internal and external is visualised by the reader easily, I think this is fantastic writing, and also as a debut an awesome piece of work (only one I didn\u2019t love personally) also interesting was the intricacies of a family that doesn\u2019t flow the way it should, her parents growing up with nothing, amounting this nothing to amazing wealth, and the lengths a father will go to to keep this wealth in a whole state at the peril of a daughter that should be beloved. I honestly didn\u2019t like the personalities of the two main characters, they weren\u2019t an enjoyable pair to read about \u2013 regardless of the horrible nature of the storyline. Their quirks and just down right natures didn\u2019t appeal (to me).But as reading should always do, it taught me an awful lot about a topic I\u2019m unfamiliar \u2013 the country of Haiti and it\u2019s desperate way. My favourite character hands down was Lorraine. She had such a nice way with the \u2018after\u2019 Mireille, who told her story in the before and after of her brutal ordeal."}, {"userName": "Mocha Girl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1251457-mocha-girl", "userReview": "An Untamed State is a novel that spotlights victims of trauma and their road to recovery. The central character, Mirielle, is the American-born daughter of Haitian parents. Her parents, born from humble beginnings eventually move back to Haiti to continue their prosperous business ventures. While visiting her parents with her husband and infant son, Mireille is kidnapped, repeatedly gang-raped, physically and psychologically tortured for nearly two weeks because her father refuses to pay the ransom for her release. The first half of the novel is told from Mireille\u2019s point of view opening with the kidnapping and two weeks of captivity where details of her abuse yield some cringe-worthy passages. It is introspective in nature because the reader stays with her while she systemically invokes her will to survive despite the toll it takes on her body and psyche. Insight into her mindset and other character backstories are encapsulated in flashback segments delivered while in captivity as things progress from bad to worse. The author succeeded in giving the reader a strong sense of place gained from a frightened and beaten heroine struggling to survive the nightmare as negotiations deteriorate. The second half of the book is post-kidnapping and deals with her suffering terribly from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), her physical and mental recuperation, her husband's struggles and frustration, and her parent\u2019s guilt and shame. This is a character-driven novel that contains some elements of social commentary (Haitian class and educational inequality, social disparities), romance, familial dysfunction, and politics. However, the vast majority of the book focuses on the torture and the aftereffects of dealing with PTSD. Not having any experience with PTSD or kidnap victims, I can only surmise the author researched and presented a realistic experience.I found quite a few repetitive passages and some of the dialogue and \u201clove\u201d scenes a bit heavy-handed. Although I empathized and sympathized with the lead character, I found her (and most) characters a bit too \u201cMade for TV\u201d perfect, \u201ccardboard-ish,\u201d and dare I say, unlikeable. While I have no issues with the grim and dark subject matter, I expected a bit more on Haitian socio-economic history, government corruption, etc. based on the book blurbs and advanced press releases. Those topics are superficially interwoven into the story. I\u2019m not discounting the book for my obvious misunderstanding, but just want to mention it because others might have have the same assumptions based on the book synopsis."}, {"userName": "Kima", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6025687-kima", "userReview": "Horrible things happen in this book but you know that because you've read the back flap.What stays with me, though, is the treatment of race in this novel. I can't get over it. I feel like I read a book trying to convince me of the goodness of one white man and then the goodness of one true blue white American family, and then the goodness of a corn husking white community.It is a brutal novel, of course it is, it's about a 13 day kidnapping and rape, but even in this brutality, in a story where a woman is stripped of everything whole and right in her life, all I am left with is the goodness of white people. White people so good that they eclipse the protagonist's story with their well meaning.The fairy tale aspect of the novel is too self aware for me to believe in it or its destruction.

References to the scenes of graphic violence were enough to turn me away. But as Roxane Gay\u2019s star continued to rise this past year and I read more of her columns, followed her on Twitter (there are few reasons for hanging out on Twitter, but Roxane is one of them), and became enamored of her voice and her personal politics in Bad Feminist, I turned back to An Untamed State.Just a few years before Haiti is crippled by the 2010 earthquake, Mireille Duval Jameson, a young American woman of Haitian descent, her corn-fed Midwestern husband Michael, and their infant son Christophe pay a visit to Haiti, where Mireille's parents live in palatial splendor in Port-au-Prince. One morning, on their way to the beach, the couple and their son are mobbed immediately outside the Duval's walled compound. Mireille is kidnapped at gunpoint and held for ransom for thirteen days. In the first part of An Untamed State, Mireille recounts her ordeal at the hands of her young captors, with flashbacks to earlier, happier times. In Part II, the final third of the novel, the reader experiences the aftermath. It is as difficult and wrenching a read as you might imagine. The novel\u2019s opening dedication is \u201cFor women, the world over.\u201d And to this end, Gay sets out to show the world what violence against women looks like, what it feels like, what it can do to the body and to the soul. She is unflinching in her depiction of gang rape and unsparing in her scorn of those who would use women as pawns in a battle of wills. Nearly as difficult to absorb as the gang rape and torture of Mireille by bored, angry young men is the refusal by Mireille\u2019s father to pay the $1 million ransom. He has the money; it\u2019s his principles he is loath to compromise. The phone conversations between Mireille and her husband and father will gut you: her family has somehow convinced themselves that she is simply being held, perhaps in a dull hotel room, scared and bored, but coming to no harm. Not until the very end does Mireille let on that she is being brutalized; she, too, has principles that she is unwilling to compromise. She refuses to let her captors break her. But really, as Gay shows us, that\u2019s no longer her choice. Several sections of the book are given over to Michael, Mireille\u2019s husband, who flails helplessly in a world he doesn\u2019t understand. He doesn\u2019t speak French and the socio-political situation in Haiti is far removed from his Nebraska farm boy upbringing and solid middle class values; that the woman he adores could be a pawn in a business transaction where the vigilantes seek to right the imbalance between Haiti\u2019s impoverished and its wealthy elite is nearly incomprehensible to him, as is his father-in-law's refusal to save his child. The time Roxane Gay gives the reader to breathe in between scenes of Mireille\u2019s torture are taken up by flashbacks of Mireille and Michael\u2019s courtship and marriage. It is here she seeks to deepen Mireille\u2019s character, to remove her from the role of victim by showing a strong, complex individual. The scenes between Mireille and her suspicious mother-in-law, Lorraine, are heart-gripping. However, much of Mireille and Michael\u2019s backstory is banal and detracts from the novel\u2019s powerful themes. I cannot relate the moments showing immature and manipulative Mireille and fawning Michael to the narrative\u2019s core. A scene in which the points-of-view switch between Michael and Mireille leaves me baffled. Could the writer really have intended that head-hopping? But then comes the profound, graceful Part II, where Mireille is released, broken and dead, into a world that is only two weeks older, but galaxies out of her grasp. It is here that we see how one woman tries to reclaim what was lost. Gay\u2019s writing rises as it deepens and both Mireille and Michael become fully-realized characters and their marriage mature and sympathetic. Their struggle for self-awareness and for mutual empathy is believable, gut-wrenching, and tender. The themes are balanced like plates juggled on handsticks. Gay is deliberate in presenting the sins of social and economic injustice in Haiti without evoking sympathy for the young men who would brutalize a woman for profit; she shows the condescending racism in the United States, yet makes one of the most redeeming characters a white woman with deeply-ingrained prejudice. The characters are nuanced and resist all stereotypes. A father who pulls himself from poverty to unimaginable wealth is a pathetic villain; a helpless husband glows in the romantic lead spotlight. And the ending is brilliant.Gay\u2019s writing style is fresh, straightforward, unflinching. I\u2019d compare her to two writers whose writing I admire, even if the content of their novels is not of interest to me as a reader: the tension-driven, hard-boiled style of Gillian Flynn and the sexy warmth of Terry McMillan. Yet, Roxane Gay\u2019s voice is entirely, powerfully, resonantly, her own.At times I wanted her to dig more deeply into themes of social injustice and economic inequality, rather than showing the ungainly romance between Mireille and Michael, but in the end, these are themes I am left thinking about and exploring, so for that, and for Gay\u2019s brilliant depiction of how we heal and do not heal after trauma, I recommend this highly."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2013209-janet", "userReview": "I am breathless...this may well be the best book I'll read it 2014.
