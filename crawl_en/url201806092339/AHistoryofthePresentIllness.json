The stories are marvelous. They\u2019re exceptional. They\u2019re incredibly deftly written. Each story is a gem, as is the entire narrative. Though I thoroughly enjoyed the book, it wasn\u2019t a comfort read for me. In fact, all my hypochondriac tendencies and fears about my future health status were activated, but I loved the stories anyway, despite feeling sad, infuriated, and especially really scared at times while reading. It greatly helped that the compassionate nature of the writer continually shines through the pages.I haven\u2019t enjoyed a short story book as much since I read How to Breathe Underwater by Julie Orringer. Although I\u2019ve always enjoyed reading essays, but my usual preference is to read novels and full-length non-fiction books rather than short stories and books of short stories. However, these are intersecting stories, with characters that sometimes make appearances in different stories. The stories also somehow feel as if they\u2019re part of one story, and in general they do follow a timeline, from young to old, from students to experienced medical doctors. The whole thing worked really well. I thought the stories fit together so well even before I got to the last story, and that last story solidified the job of tying all the stories together. These stories are published as fiction but all along they read as truth to me, and the last story makes clear that each does have a huge non-fiction component. That\u2019s why this book is on so many of my apparently contradictory shelves.I love the quote that starts the book: \u201cIf you don\u2019t care for obscenity, you don\u2019t care for the truth.\u201d (It\u2019s by Tim O\u2019Brien from How to Tell a War Story. I can\u2019t find that book at Goodreads but I probably wouldn\u2019t add it to my favorite quotes anyway, even though I really like the quote and it definitely fits this book.) One of my big quibbles with medicine, ever since I was aware, from eleven years old on, is the dishonestly. When it comes to medical matters I value honesty above all else. (I recently took a continuing education class about end of life care and was tempted to write a long rant in the feedback section to their contention that what is most important when treating a patient is hope. Not for myself it isn\u2019t; it\u2019s honesty.) I appreciate that she has worked in palliative care. I loved the San Francisco settings. I could identify most of them and am familiar with some of them. I always enjoy books that I can put on my san-francisco shelf. This book makes wonderful use of the city, its medical facilities but also many other places.I really appreciated how skillfully the relationships and communications and miscommunications were explored, from cross-cultural, to supervisor-supervisee, doctor-patient, between lovers and between friends, between group members, etc.As I read these stories I couldn\u2019t help but be aware of the following of my feelings/beliefs: Don't get sick. Don't get disabled. Don't get old if not in perfect health, and be wealthy, not poor. And perhaps: Don\u2019t go into medicine, or be careful it\u2019s your true calling if you do. I have physicians in my family and I\u2019ve watched many in the process of dying, so I\u2019d already thought a great deal about these matters, but reading this book has caused enough of a shift that I think I\u2019ll be looking at death & dying and doctor-patient relationships slightly differently.I\u2019m always impressed by and frequently enjoy writing by physicians. On the back inside cover of the book, in the bio section, it says that \u201cShe is an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, where she cares for older patients and directs the Northern California Geriatric Education Center and UCSF Medical Humanities.\u201d She probably couldn\u2019t have written this exact book without her medical training and practice, but it reads as a book written by a true writer, and I hope she writes and publishes more work. I\u2019ll read it if she does."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer", "userReview": "this author makes me so jealous/envious -- harvard MD.

This is not the standard medical memoir: \"here's what happened to me in the ER today.\" No, this is spell-binding fiction a la John Cheever or Alice Munroe. The stories are surprising, eclectic, engaging, and edifying. The characters are fully drawn and so alive on the page. There is not another book like this in the literary medical world.

All the stories in this collection (her first publication) grow out of the experiences of patients, families of patients, medical caregivers and their families. Others have done this -- and done it well -- but Aronson's work stands out specifically for the insight into the lives of women who take up medicine. Even when the main character is male, there is a female psychiatrist not very far in the background who is the lynchpin in his story (\"Giving Good Death,\"). I especially liked \"Blurred Boundary Disorder,\" which takes the form of a frenzied, footnote-riddled letter to a female physician's superiors. She is determined to change her own history, and to do so by forcing new terms for her own symptoms into the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. It is a challenging story to read, but it may also the most interesting picture I have ever had of the inner workings of a psychiatrist's mind. Aronson is full of compassion and at the same time, she dissects with ruthless efficiency. Her skill is in isolating the clearest, most revealing details and serving them up without sugar-coating. I have rated this four stars out of five, simply because collections of short stories are much harder to pull off, and there are a few uneven entries."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3594188-kate", "userReview": "See my full review here: http://booksaremyfavouriteandbest.wor...I\u2019ve got a couple of friends who are nurses and doctors. Two have them have worked in the emergency department of a major city hospital in Melbourne. They have the BEST dinner party stories.I wonder if Louise Aronson, a doctor and an author, wrote A History of the Present Illness at the prompting of her friends? Maybe not \u2013 her collection of interlinked short stories are a brilliant mix of the delicate, hard-hitting, personal and coolly remote \u2013 not dinner party conversation fodder at all.Before the recent, terrible event in Sandy Hook in the US, Obama\u2019s reforms to the American health system were filtering through to the news broadcast in Australia. Gun control may take over policy debate within the forseeable future however the issues in the existing healthcare system will still be festering away. When I look at pop-culture takes on the US healthcare system that have influenced (and to a certain extent informed) me over the past decade it comes down to three things \u2013 Mike Moore\u2019s documentary, Sicko; Lionel Schriver\u2019s novel, So Much For That (and an accompanying author talk that I attended); and my guilty television pleasure, Grey\u2019s Anatomy. So I\u2019m hardly qualified for judging whether Aronson\u2019s collection of stories are a fair reflection of US healthcare. Instead, I put judgement aside and enjoyed each story for what it was \u2013 a heartfelt snapshot of men, women and children in the neighborhoods, hospitals and nursing homes of San Francisco.All of the sixteen stories are little lessons in compassion with Aronson swinging the reader from the perspective of doctor, to patient, to on-looking family member. Some stories are told in the first person, others in the third. Some are lush, detailed and sentimental whilst others are stark, clinical. Despite the obvious changes in creative writing style between the stories, there are subtle links between each and the overall result is impressive.There are no weak spots in this collection. From the first story, a man talking about his day-in-day-out visits with his wife who is in a nursing home after suffering a stroke -\u201cIt\u2019s much like caring for a baby, he explains to his daughter, except without the sweet smells, without the hope.\u201d- to the heart-wrenching story of a little girl with a bed-wetting problem and a young man dying without family by his side -\u201cThe nursing notes in his chart said that Jake\u2019s family never visited\u2026 It was impossible to look at Jake\u2019s torso and not think plague and curse and infestation and death. But it was equally impossible to imagine how people could stop seeing, touching, and loving their son.\u201dI started the last story in the collection not realising that it is the author\u2019s story. It offers some nice insights into her work as both a doctor and as an author and how each role informs the other.\u201cIn medicine, the \u2018history of the present illness\u2019, or HPI, is the critical first portion of the medical note that describes the onset, duration, character, context, and severity of the illness. Basically, it\u2019s the story, and without it, you can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with your patient.\u201d4/5 A memorable collection of stories.My copy of A History of the Present Illness was courtesy of Bloomsbury."}, {"userName": "Joy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1557329-joy", "userReview": "Every one of the sixteen short stories in this interlocked collection is an exquisitely etched jewel. Set in the SF Bay area in various medical care facilities they bring us characters experiencing health crisis and their families and care givers with the aggregate effect shining a spotlight on the state of the American health care industry. Every story is unique, varying in style, tone, length, voice, tempo and form. From the intergenerational family (made-for-TV-move?) drama in 'Heart Failure', to the list of facts in '25 Things I Know About My Mother-in-Law', to the heavily (neurotically?) footnoted memo sent by one psychiatrist to the psychiatrists chairing the panel working on the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders advocating for inclusion of a new subset of boundary disorders in 'Blurred Boundary Disorder' and whether attempting the objectivity of a camera in 'Snapshots from an Institution' or the intimate inner experience of an Iraq vet amputee in 'After' or the unreliable narrator in 'Lucky You' Aronson's stories open our heart and consciousness to the human condition and the modern surrealistic state of affairs in America's medical care institutions.as posted at JoystoryBy drawing her characters with such observational skill and empathy she gives us back the original meaning of the word 'caring' currently so distorted by the mechanized, bureaucratized, politicized, and profitized health care industry. This book should be required reading for every first year med student and every legislator at both state and federal level. The stories in this book and stories like them should become the underpinning of any further national discussion about health care legislation. My favorite story is probably the last one, 'A Medical Story', which is itself a musing on the definition of 'story' and blurs the boundaries between story narrator and author and confesses the origin of all the stories in actual events lived or learned of by the author. This also blurs the boundaries between genre making it hard to place the book solidly in either the NF or fiction categories since only names and certain details were changed to protect the privacy of families and individuals. And yet tho rooted solidly in actual events these stories are crafted like literary stories designed to elicit that inner 'ah' of awe and the collection arranged to emphasize their meaning--a meaning that cannot be stated any more succinctly. By taking these true stories and climbing into the hearts and heads of their actors with her informed imagination and arranging the action to emphasize meaning Aronson gives us fiction that is truer than fact and stories that will live in our hearts and inform our conscience."}, {"userName": "Tamara Green", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17407243-tamara-green", "userReview": "Such a beautiful work of literature and social commentary, without heavy handed moralizing.

Basically, it\u2019s the story, and without it, you can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with your patient.\u201dA History of the Present Illness is an extraordinary collection of peripherally linked vignettes that explore the current practice and experience of health care in America. Insightful, honest and compassionate, Aronson, an accomplished practicing physician overlays truth with fiction to illustrate the plight of her colleagues, patients and families as they navigate bureaucracy and illness. Clinical objectivity blurs with humane compassion, triumph with heartbreak in stories of complex, emotional and medical crisis.There are sixteen stories that cross the boundaries of race, age and gender. Each give a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people within the health care system. Patients like Rodney Brown whose leg aches even though he left it in the desert sand of Afghanistan (After) and doctors like Robert who witness the obscenity of slow death and and are expected to do nothing (Giving Good Death). I found 'An Amercian Problem' almost unbearably sad, it is an indictment of a society who has relinquished the care of its most vulnerable members in favour of balancing the budget, and 'Soup or Sex?' an incredibly touching portrait of a young man fighting with uncommon bravery to be more than his disease. All of the anecdotes are affecting however, inspiring hope and admiration as often as anger and disgust.A History of The Present Illness is a remarkable read, quietly attesting to the triumphs and failures of the American health care system. Forget what you think you know of medicine from watching Grey's Anatomy or General Hospital. In real life, caring for people is much messier than either show can portray.Just a note: There was a problem with the formatting of my Kindle ARC edition that I hope is not present in the finished version. Aside from broken sentences, there were no clear separators between the stories and I was thrown a number of times by suddenly finding myself in the midst of a new story. The formatting issues also made 'Blurred Boundary Disorder' particularly difficult to read."}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "I admire short fiction writers. I do not admire any books set in hospitals, because hospitals make me queasy. That said, I enjoyed this book very much, set in several hospitals of San Francisco, all playing into my queasiness. I think it's the tone that does it. The people in the different stories belong to various social strata/race/health. Aronson gives them all their own voice, while still keeping her narrative tone. She brings her own experience as a doctor, and she personalizes the people to more than just cases. Some stories are of doctors, who are presented as layered, complex people but also very human at the same time. Some of my favorite stories were of the doctors - Blurred Boundary Disorder: A footnoted thesis on what the author calls Blurred Boundary Disorder and that she says she has, which in a fashion caused her downfall (she's suspended from practicing); Lucky You: An ex-doctor (there is such a thing) wastes precious minutes before helping a young boy after a massive fall; and of course, the most interesting one, A Medical Story: which Louise Aronson's story, of where she got her stories.Recommended, especially for fans of medical fiction.

In other words, they really happened to her, her patients, their families, or other MD\u2019s, but the names and some situations have been changed to protect privacy. As Dr. Aronson writes, \u201cWithin weeks of completing my medical training, I began taking writing classes from talented and dedicated writer-teachers\u2026at the Warren Wilson Program for Writers.\u201c\u2026For some people in medicine, fiction writing is a foreign and questionable activity. I have been fortunate to work for people whose open minds and flexibility allowed me to take on a second career not only without compromising my medical career but in a way that enriched both.\u201dElsewhere in the book, Dr. Aronson states,\u201cOf course, what most doctors call stories aren\u2019t really stories at all. They\u2019re anecdotes, which my Webster\u2019s dictionary tells me are \u2018usu. short narrative(s) of an interesting, amusing, or biographical incident.\u2019\u201d\u201cThough I couldn\u2019t have articulated it correctly at the time, what inspired me most in medicine was the opportunity to go beyond everyday exposition to life\u2019s trigger problems and rising action, its culminations, turning points, and denouements.\u201d\u201c\u2026In contrast to anecdote, story\u2014at least in the literary sense\u2014offers so much more: narrative arc, movement, unification of action, irrevocable change. Meaning.\u201dAll in all, I believe Dr. Aronson has admirably fulfilled her desire to present the meaningful part of medicine through moving literary stories without compromising her medically scientific sensibilities. I highly recommend A History of the Present Illness. Those involved in medicine, either as MD's or other paramedical personnel, will probably get even more out the stories because they have experienced similar episodes during their time with patients and in their pre-clinical and clinical years as students of medicine."}, {"userName": "Juhi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11594640-juhi", "userReview": "I started the book this morning, and I couldn't put it down until it was over.

Shortly after the first time I read this compilation of sixteen fictional medical stories, the powerful video \"Empathy: The Human Connection to Patient Care\" from the Cleveland Clinic went viral, and I thought \"This video is the perfect visualization of Dr. Aronson's stories.\"Her writing shows the thoughts and motivations of each character, even those \"just passing through.\" For example, this passage from \"Snapshots From an Institution\":\"With the tidy chrome machine hidden beneath his lap blanket, he wheeled himself down to the Total Care Unit kitchen, where he sold it at one third its retail value to a woman who smelled of garlic and dirty dishwasher and barely spoke English but knew her kids needed computers if they were going to avoid ending up like the young man from whom she bought the computer. (page 8)\"My first read of this book was to just \"inhale\" the story plots and swallow them whole. During the second read-through, I spent time savoring the perfectly-chosen language Aronson uses to describe the difficult decisions of health care professionals and the complex life circumstances of patients.What I appreciated most was her variety of storytelling formats. In \"Becoming a Doctor,\" Aronson uses the titles of classic works of feminist literature (The Second Sex, The Yellow Wallpaper) as subtitles for short snapshots of the medical training of a young female doctor. In \"Twenty-Five Things I Know About My Husband's Mother\" Aronson uses a simple numbered list to expertly craft a story of the life and death of a woman the narrator has never even met. Each story offers the reader a chance to reflect on their own interactions with the health care system and reconsider the lives in which patients and doctors are situated. There is a lot more room for understanding on both sides.Note: A few months after I first read this book, Dr. Aronson, the author, was awarded a prestigious Gold Foundation Professorship from the Arnold P.

Most were negative, in some way, so were they meant as \"don't live life this way\" messages? Actually, though, I was interested in the first couple of stories: \"An American Problem\" where a young girl took advantage of her 3 free psychiatric visits which weren't enough to help her, \"Giving Good Death\" about a doctor who was in prison due to the death of a patient, \"Heart Failure\" about a doctor whose teenage daughter was acting out. Then were was a long drought until \"Vital Signs Stable\" where a young doctor missed a diagnosis and felt very bad about it. I was confused about why it was important to mention that the doctor was gay--was it because the author felt that's why he would be so sensitive or something? It didn't seem important to the story at all, so I wondered why it was even mentioned. \"Days of Awe\" was enjoyable in a totally negative way, kind of a \"nyah-nyah, that's what you get\" feeling about it.

The mood is generally grim, and pretty pessimistic about Medicine. My favorite stories (other than the one above) are the ones I think are autobiographical...but I'm not sure, in the end, if any are, and that makes it hard to be moved by the whole. They all have SF General in common (a hospital at which I also worked for a year in 1989), and UCSF Family Medicine Residency in common as well, and many characters appear in more than one story, but it feels a little hollow to me overall because I'm not where she stands.

She also displays an admirable sense of restraint and a keen eye for quiet details.These stories don't flinch or offer easy answers to any of the flaws in the medical system, quite evident throughout, or the questions that need time to articulate and even then cannot be definitively answered.All these things would make this an excellent book, but what made it wonderful is the authors own sense of integrity and the quality of her compassion.>>>Francis Weld Peabody...said \"The secret of caring for the patient is to care for the patient.\" ....Too late, she understood that the secret was caring for the patient--for anyone--just a little.

I've been an RN at UCLA for the past 6 1/2 years and although I am on \"friendly\" terms with some of the physicians I work with, I have NEVER come across one of them who express sentiments like these. Doctors rarely give their patients a second thought after leaving the room (if they ever enter it to begin with) much less show any empathy at all. They don't even do a hand-on exam any more. They rely on the bedside nurse who is with the patient 24/7, and the on staff Nurse Practitioner to actually lay hands on the patient for an initial H&P - which they promptly copy and paste into their notes as though it were their own to lay claim to. So I call a big bullshit on all these stories. Pure fiction. Would be nice if they were true, but in reality it just doesn't happen."}, {"userName": "Martha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5085890-martha", "userReview": "This book is a collection of essays, written by a doctor and looks at \"the history of the present illness\". For those non medical types, the HPI is sort of the background of the patient encounter. A very promising premise for a story.Each essay was well crafted. The author used a variety of styles to tell each assorted story. I found myself reflecting on ,y own patient encounters and thinking Wow, that sounds like Mrs. X. But I really wish in some way she connected a few of the essays a little better. Some overlapped but it was subtle and didn't really flow. I guess in the end, I was hoping for some morale to each story....something like a \"chicken soup for the soul\" type book but instead, the next essay just started right up.Disconnected, and I think appeals mostly to those of us with a medical background...."}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5762106-carla", "userReview": "This book is depressing but I couldn't stop reading it. It describes things that happen to almost anyone, like getting old, dealing with injury or dealing with trauma, in a really poignant and truthful way. I think the reason it's so depressing is because it is so truthful; you can imagine these stories happening to family members or friends. The short stories are not bundled up in a neat package. Almost with every story, I couldn't believe it was over because there was no resolution. Also I am a first year PhD student in economics and I could relate a little bit to the med students choice to enter school in order to do something important and good and their struggle with the massive amount of schooling, memorization, tests and studying in order to get to the other side."}, {"userName": "Jaime K", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13180341-jaime-k", "userReview": "I won this in a Goodreads giveaway.Aronson has compiled stories based on real events she's witnessed over her years in the medical field. The first third of the stories were interesting, entertaining, and even adorable. They tugged at my heart and made me glad I'm not a doctor or nurse.But then they started to drag, and I had to push myself to continue reading. There were some good ones interspersed, but mainly I felt that they were bland. Overall the stories show the life a doctor lives from their internship on, and how we as a people can't escape the horrors and depression that occur in life.I just couldn't enjoy it after a while."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5370204-jane", "userReview": "I read a review of this book in the Statesman and was motivated to read it because of it's witness to the lives of physicians and patients. The short collection of short stories are both lovely and honest, illustrating the grueling experience of medical training and the impact it can have on the personal lives of those thus engaged, and also capturing in sometimes heartbreaking fashion the human drama of medical care. I'm sure Aronson is a well trained, compassionate physician, but she's also a superb craftsman of the written word."}, {"userName": "Louise Aronson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13585890-louise-aronson", "userReview": "This book (my book!) kept appearing on my page as \"want to read' which began to seem absurd.

I was intrigued when I heard about this book, but a bit trepidacious with it being about medical issues. Fear not as Aronson writes with beautiful clarity and focuses on the human struggle of patients as well as doctors and nurses. I particularly enjoyed \"Becoming a Doctor\", \"Vital Signs Stable\" and \"The Promise\". This is both hopeful and heartbreaking. Highly recommended."}], "description": "A History of the Present Illness takes readers into overlooked lives in the neighborhoods, hospitals, and nursing homes of San Francisco, offering a deeply humane and incisive portrait of health and illness in America today. An elderly Chinese immigrant sacrifices his demented wife's well-being to his son's authority. A busy Latina physician's eldest daughter's need for more attention has disastrous consequences. A young veteran's injuries become a metaphor for the rest of his life. A gay doctor learns very different lessons about family from his life and his work, and a psychiatrist who advocates for the underserved may herself be crazy. Together, these honest and compassionate stories introduce a striking new literary voice and provide a view of what it means to be a doctor and a patient unlike anything we've read before.\nIn the tradition of Oliver Sacks and Abraham Verghese, Aronson's writing is based on personal experience and addresses topics of current social relevance. Masterfully told, A History of the Present Illness explores the role of stories in medicine and creates a world pulsating with life, speaking truths about what makes us human.", "title": "A History of the Present Illness", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15793559-a-history-of-the-present-illness", "average": 3.76, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1350952732l/15793559.jpg", "reviews": 68, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6457953.Louise_Aronson", "name": "Louise Aronson"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Health", "Medical", "Health"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15793559-a-history-of-the-present-illness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17978118-a-history-of-the-present-illness"]}
