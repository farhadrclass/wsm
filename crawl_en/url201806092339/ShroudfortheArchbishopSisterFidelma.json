Fidelma is to deliver important messages from Ireland\u2019s rulers and religious orders, while Eadulf is there to accompany and interpret for the new archbishop-designate of Canterbury.The Lateran Palace houses all the highest-placed guests to the Bishop of Rome himself, so when a murder takes place there, it becomes a high priority to solve it. Since the main suspect also happens to be an Irish monk, Rome\u2019s officials are afraid this will cause a war to break out between the Saxons and the Irish on their home turf, which would then tear apart the fragile fabric of the newly fashioned religious conciliation under Rome.This is a fascinating story, not just because Sister Fidelma and Brother Eadulf are once again teamed up to seek the truth of the murder, but also because of the glimpses offered of Rome itself in the mid-600\u2019s. Woven into this main story is interesting information regarding the second destruction of the Great Library of Alexandria, and many other historical pieces that now have a context where before they were more isolated incidents for me.I confess that I have a great fascination for historical fiction that is well-done \u2013 and \u2013 I also love reading mysteries that are well-done. No doubt this series satisfies both of those reading enjoyments for me. I think I just became re-addicted to this series in my attempt to fill in the early gaps I missed previously.I also love quotes \u2013 and this book has several to contemplate. Many of these quotes are still in use these many centuries later, and for a good reason: they are little nuggets and nutshells of truth. I am looking forward to my next adventure with these strong, interesting, talented, and intelligent characters leading the way."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41670-simon", "userReview": "Same issues I had with the first book in the series, but this time on steroids. Tremayne is absolutely owning his setting --- this time Rome in 665, where Fidelma and Brother Eadmus have journeyed to see to the blessing of Wighard, Archbishop of Canterbury. The city becomes a major player in the archbishop's subsequent murder. The \"mystery\" is terrible, and the solution --- though not some of the subplots, which are too complicated/boring to bother with --- is so obvious that anyone who reads mysteries much will spot it without too much trouble. But in the slog to the Get Every Suspect in the Room denouement that Tremayne seems to favor, you do get terrific descriptions of the buildings and districts of period Rome, as well as some insights as to how the early medieval Church functioned. But . . . Tremayne lost me when Fidelma was attacked and demonstrated early medieval Irish judo techniques to beat her foe. So not only is she the smartest person in the room all of the time, incredibly feminist and Irish proto-nationalist all of the time, Fidelma has wicked Emma Peel fighting moves? By the next book I expect her to have heat vision. Look, I get that the Irish saved civilization (note my last name). But Sister Fidelma could apparently have done it all by herself. Oh, did I mention? Of course, Fidelma is hot, hot, hawt! Monks, Roman soldiers, you name it, they want to possess her, making her an early medieval Irish Judy Tenuta. If you can put up with the silly plots, the series appears to be worth it for the settings. I don't know if I can."}, {"userName": "booklady", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady", "userReview": "Shroud for the Archbishop is second in the Sister Fidelma mystery series. A good friend loaned me her copy even though I wasn\u2019t really looking for any more books. My friend said she knew I would love Sister and she was right. To get an idea of Fidelma\u2019s character, think Irish female Brother Cadfeael* five centuries earlier. Sr. Fidelma is witty, smart and living in the How the Irish Saved Civilization time period, the 7th century\u2014pretty much considered the \u2018Dark Ages\u2019 everywhere in Europe except in Ireland. It\u2019s been awhile since I read Thomas Cahill\u2019s history and though I don\u2019t recall women having quite the freedom and authority which author Peter Tremayne portrays, it makes for an excellent story.In Shroud Fidelma has traveled to Rome with a combined English/Irish group. Mystery aside, the book is interesting just for the cultural socio-religious historical observations and machinations. How accurate they are, I can't say, but they make for some interesting speculation!Looking forward to reading others in this series. *Popular character in series by author Ellis Peters"}, {"userName": "Ana Elena Romero", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23436873-ana-elena-romero", "userReview": "En esta segunda entrega de la monja detective, Tremayne va perfilando m\u00e1s el car\u00e1cter de los personajes que comenz\u00f3 a dibujar en la primera novela.Sor Fidelma va adquiriendo protagonismo en detrimento de Eadulf, quien se va convirtiendo progresivamente en un mero espectador/acompa\u00f1ante de la inteligente protagonista.No se caracterizan estas novelas por el poder de deducci\u00f3n l\u00f3gica sino porque van presentando los hechos con la cadencia suficiente como para que se vayan desentra\u00f1ando los misterios por si solos, lo cu\u00e1l hace que no pueda considerarse un thriller polic\u00edaco.En cualquier caso son novelas cortas, entretenidas y de f\u00e1cil lectura, que consiguen entretener y enganchar al lector."}, {"userName": "kostas  vamvoukakis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14057149-kostas-vamvoukakis", "userReview": "\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c7\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03be\u03b5\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03c9 \u03b5\u03b4\u03ce \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03cc. \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03c7\u03c9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03c9\u03c1\u03ac\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c3\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf. \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c8\u03ac\u03be\u03c9 \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf 6\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 (\u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b5\u03af\u03bf) \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03b9\u03c3\u03c9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1. \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c6\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b8\u03b3\u03cc\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03c2. \u03c3\u03c6\u03b9\u03c7\u03c4\u03ae \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03af \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2...\u03b1\u03c8\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1"}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/572977-kate", "userReview": "A slow-moving and lecturey follow-up to the first book, with characters less dimensional.

We have a fiery Irish sister who not only solves crimes, but does so with the highest authority. The lady can speak on a level with kings. Lots of people lie, almost as many die. Everything is crammed into about the space of three or four days.So why was I so consistently bored?It has to be a problem of presentation. The tone is very dry, and I felt no difference between reading this and skimming a heavy textbook. Although characters do emote, the style is almost strictly 100% TELL. A lot of reviews bring up Show-Don't-Tell, but they usually don't explain what they mean. Telling, even when an emotion is involved, renders the information flat. \"Fidelma was astonished.\" Knowing how she felt is not the same as seeing how she felt. Showing the same would look more like this: \"Fidelma staggered back a step, one hand half-raised to her heart.\"That almost never happens. And I think the reason is easily ascertained by examining another problem with the book: treating readers like idiots. Granted, the author knows more than probably anyone else who will ever read this book. But he doesn't encourage, facilitate, or even allow inference. The worst culprit is this gem:\"...If a man dare kiss, or even touch a woman against her will, by law of the Fenechus he can be fined two hundred and forty silver screpall.\"Eadulf knew that the screpall was one of the main Irish coins that were circulated.I didn't know what a screpall was before Fidelma used the word. But her usage of it made it pretty clear that it meant MONEY. Not only was no further information necessary, the manner in which it was given is ridiculous. That kind of thing runs rampant throughout. This kind of information should be a seamless part of the story, not jarring insertions of research notes.The murder mystery itself may be a decent, forensics mystery, but having the correct formula with some good twists isn't enough. The world is too starkly presented and the characters somehow manage to have absolutely no voice. At all. I didn't think you could even do that.I want so much to like these books, and all I get out of them is tired and bewildered. I remember someone once complaining to me of the weakness in the setting of the first book, but this one was really bad.

After the death of Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury, mentioned in the first book, Absolution by Murder, his chosen successor, Wighard, has travelled to Rome to be confirmed in his position by the Pope. As his secretary, Brother Eadulf has naturally accompanied him. And fortuitously, Sister Fidelma has also been ordered to Rome, to present the new Rule of her abbey of Kildare to the Holy Father for approval. When Wighard is murdered and an Irish monk working in the Vatican\u2019s Foreign Secretariat is arrested as the most likely suspect, the political implications of the case demand an unusual degree of sensitivity. Thanks to their successful unraveling of the murders during the Synod of Whitby, Sister Fidelma and Brother Eadulf are called on to investigate the murder and determine the truth. Their investigation tajes many twists and turns, as not one, but many crimes, past and present, are found to have come together in a vast sequence of murder, false identity, theft and vengeance. And again, what makes the tale particularly fascinating to me is the wealth of historical detail that includes everything from a discussion of the relics collected by Empress Helena to the fate of the great Library of Alexandria. A sold mystery, with a wonderful historical setting and a formidable detective. I find myself very much enjoying Sister Fidelma as a character. Her profession, status, and cultural background give her an at tines almost modern feeling, as a woman sure of her abilities and rights.

It\u0019 s curious that the series touts itself as \u001c a mystery of ancient Ireland\u001d , because the first two books are set in Saxon England and in Rome, respectively. We learn a good deal about Irish culture and law, but see nothing of Ireland itself.[return][return]Fidelma has been sent to Rome by the religious authorities in Ireland to see approval for the rule of the community at Kildare. She meets figures from the first book: Brother Eadulf, to whom she is attracted and Archbishop of Canterbury-designate Wighard. He is murdered, and the pope himself is anxious for Fidelma and Eadulf to find the killer because given the tensions between the Celtic and Roman sects, war could break out in England if one side believed the other had assassinated.[return][return]The plot is resolved, of course, but not before a great many other religious are killed off. Makes you wonder how the Christian churches managed to survive, given the high mortality rate of its clerics! [return][return]Through Sister Fidelma, Tremayne does not hesitate to criticize the Roman Church and its fondness for luxury and expensive trappings for its religious buildings and accoutrements, as well as hold up for ridicule the superstitious beliefs in relics, such as the True Cross (not even in Palestine under the best of conditions is wood going to last that long) and the staircase Christ descended from Pilate\u0019 s palace, all venerated by the Church in Rome.[return][return]Tremayne\u0019 s description of 7th century Rome, the impact of the rise of Islam, and the politics of the Roman Church, even if fictionalized, make the book interesting. The prose is marginally better than the first book, and there is an interesting subplot involving the famous ancient library in Alexandria, destroyed in the 7th century. I\u0019 m still don\u0019 t think that the series is as good as the Brother Caedfel series\u0014 for one thing, Tremayne is fond of Nero Wolfe type endings where all the suspects are gathered together and Fidelma, in a long, drawn-out scene, goes through the evidence, the logic,and then identifies the culprit. But I have the next two books and will continue to read to see if they are an improvement, because I still like the basic premise of a setting in 7th century Celtic culture. There\u0019 s hope."}, {"userName": "Madeleine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/170060-madeleine", "userReview": "Earlier this fall, I discovered Cora Harrison's Burren Mysteries (about a woman judge in Medieval Ireland who solves mysteries and falls in love with the king, etc). I finished these and encouraged Goodreads-style reader's advisory from the public librarian types. The problem* with reader's advisory is that you often have to trust the reviews and \"advise\" readers toward books you've never read. I would imagine this generally works out fine.This time it did NOT work out fine**. The Sister Fidelma mysteries seem like a good choice, since they are also about a nun in ancient/medieval Ireland who solves mysteries and falls in love with one of her fellow monks (apparently that was cool back then). They seem like such a good choice that I gave the first book Absolution by Murder the benefit of the doubt despite (HERE ARE THE SPOLIERS) the eeeeevil lustful Lesbian killer. I mean, I suppose it was fairly well done, and how many books are there about women who solve mysteries in pre-colonial Ireland?!Then I came to book two, slightly skeptical but ready for more fun. This time (MORE SPOILERS), I encountered the eeeeevil followers of \"Mahomet.\" I get that Peter Tremayne is choosing groups who would have realistically been viewed as society's villains during the time he was writing about. However, there's gotta be a way to be true to history without making your readers cringe. At first, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and just figured the books a bit \"outdated\"...but seriously, these were written in the 1990s, not the 1890s.I might, believe it or not, give this series one more try. On an airplane or something. With a later book. However: in addition to the above, these don't actually seem to take place in Ireland (Sister Fidelma being your ancient equivalent of a modern 20-something backpacker?), *and* the mystery kind of gets explained all of a sudden by Fidelma at the end. No additional points for either of those.*Here I go dispensing opinions about RA despite never once having advised readers on leisure reading in my professional life. I advise panicky undergrads, mostly.**Carrie, can I just be clear I am NOT giving you a hard time for the rec? I think this is somewhat hilarious."}], "description": "Wighard, archbishop designate of Canterbury, has been discovered garrotted in his chambers in the Lateran Palace in Rome in the autumn of AD 664. The solution to this terrible crime appears simple as the palace guards have arrested Brother Ronan Ragallach, as he fled from Wighard's chamber. Although the Irish monk denies responsibility, Bishop Gelasius is convinced the crime is political and that Wighard was slain in pique at the triumph of the pro-Roman Anglo-Saxon clergy in their debate with the pro-Columba Irish clergy at Whitby. There is also a matter of missing treasure: the goodwill gifts Wighad had brought with him to Rome and the priceless chalices sent for the Holy Father Vitalian's blessings have all been stolen. Bishop Gelasius realises that Wighard's murder could lead to war between the Saxon and Irish kingdoms if Ronan is accused without independent evidence. So he invites Sister Fidelma of Kildare and Brother Eadulf to investigate. But more deaths must follow before Fidelma is finally able to put together the strange jigsaw in this tale of evil and vengeance.", "title": "Shroud for the Archbishop\n      \n          (Sister Fidelma #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/379142.Shroud_for_the_Archbishop", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389309926l/379142.jpg", "reviews": 106, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16291.Peter_Tremayne", "name": "Peter Tremayne"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Historical", "Historical", "Fiction", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/379142.Shroud_for_the_Archbishop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7101937-una-mortaja-para-el-arzobispo-shroud-for-the-archbishop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23618257-rub-pro-arcibiskupa", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18930167-shroud-for-the-archbishop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3112713-shroud-for-the-archbishop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1451792.Shroud_for_the_Archbishop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9635019-un-sudario-per-il-vescovo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23348078-shroud-for-the-archbishop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/706476.Absolution_by_Murder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1142347.The_Subtle_Serpent", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28979.Suffer_Little_Children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/379143.Act_of_Mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/379145.The_Monk_Who_Vanished", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
