Ten-year-old Chamdi has rarely ventured outside his orphanage, and entertains an idyllic fantasy of what the city is like-a paradise he calls Kahunsha, \"the city of no sadness.\" But when he runs away to search for his long-lost-father, he is thrust into the chaos of the streets, alone, possessing only the blood stained cloth he was left in as a baby.Chamdi struggles for survival in the harsh streets.

It offers a concise yet painfully grim glimpse into the microcosm of the street dwellers of Bombay, highlighting the acute social and psychological conflicts played out in the day to day conditions of life on the streets of the Indian megalopolis. At the thematic heart of the story is the boy\u2019s existential conflict (where do I come from, why did my father abandon me) and his attempt to take fate in his own hands. Chamdi, a ten year old orphan decides to walk away from the protective environment of a Christian-oriented orphanage into the unknown labyrinth of Bombay, the world\u2019s second most populated megalopolis (and model-city of urban planning for so-called Third-World cities in the new millennium). He is fuelled by innocent dreams of a fantastical alternate city, Kahunsha, that is the diametrical opposite of Bombay\u2019s bleak and gritty living conditions. This journey eventually leads him to a most disturbing and dramatic quandary over right versus wrong. These are complex issues, and unfortunately the books\u2019s compact length limits the exposition, so that the progressive development of character that one expects suffers as a consequence, and the novel fails to come to a compelling conclusion. The Song of Kahunsha serves up a rather spare and straightforward narrative lacking an expected complexity - the kind that I encountered, for example, recently in Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s short stories compiled in Unaccustomed Earth. There is an attempt to add some narrative layering, by placing a foreshadowing segment as the novel\u2019s opening to create a sense of circularity. But this flourish isn\u2019t a meaningful one; the time line juxtaposition doesn\u2019t really inform the reader\u2019s interpretation in any significant way.Maybe the novel\u2019s shortcoming is due to the fact that point of view in Song of Kahunsha is a necessarily simple one predicated by Chamdi\u2019s tender age. Yet there is more at fault than the limitations of a young child\u2019s perspective. Irani states that \u201cStory dictates style--the characters tell you what style you should use.... When I write about a boy's loss of innocence, it is essential to keep the writing as real, truthful, and simple as possible.\u201d Unfortunately it isn\u2019t so in this book.During the first third in particular I found the narrative techniques stylistically contrived. The environment of the orphanage is described through Chamdi's eyes, as if they are the lens of a camera panning the scene from one end to the other. I was aware of Chamdi as an expository tool to justify the description of his surroundings, rather than as a character in his own right : \"As he enters the room he sees....He turns his attention to....Now Chamdi watches...Now Chamdi sees....\" I also picked up several instances in the opening pages of the novel where the voice of Chamdi did not ring true for his age or for his specific circumstances (a confined world view that is up to that point limited by the walls of the orphanage): \"The moment you ask for something, the prayer room becomes a marketplace.\" What marketplace can Chamdi be cognizant of, if he has not yet set foot beyond the orphanage? In fact, his very ignorance of the marketplace is what tragically leads Chamdi to his eventual predicament.Later on, the street-wise Sumdi provides similarly pithy philosophical statements: \"The problem is that we live. We find just enough food to stay alive, and we are forced to live on and on in this hell.\" I found these to be more appropriate to Sumdi's character & circumstances, given the homeless boy's living conditions and the shady adults he interacts with. Even if Sumdi himself is too young to have thought it up himself, most likely he heard it from his parents, from Dabba the box-man, or even from Anand Bhai. Actually, it\u2019s Sumdi's character that is the heart of this story, and once he is gone, the novel reverts back to the initial limitations of point-of-view. Sumdi is a most vivid character - at first threatening, aggressive, then protective, defensive; initially strong, then weak; swaggering, then practical; streetwise, but also na\u00efve; possessing also an biting sense of humor (\"I'm in love. Biggest illness\"). Sumdi possesses a vibrancy that betrays the author may have been more (dis)engaged while shaping him, and thus allowed Sumdi to be who he is, unlike Chamdi who even at the most harrowing moments remains the narrative tool rather than a character in his own right. This is the novel\u2019s structural limitation. Chamdi the narrative tool starts off the story as a Candide-esque symbol of an idealized Western morality (thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill) and then his attempt to take his fate in his own hands eventually lead him into a most disturbing and dramatic quandary of right versus wrong. One of the themes of the novel is the concept of dreams and storytelling as a means to (re)create an alternate reality/script from that which is being truly experienced. Chamdi dreams of his Kahunsha, the city of no sadness and the city where \u2018no\u2019 does not exist. He is also drawn to stories \u2013 he reads out loud to the younger children in the orphanage \u2013 and he is a creator of his own stories (The Boy Whose Ribs Became Tusks). Yet Chamdi\u2019s relation to stories, dreams and alternate scripts is limited. Even though he can create a fantastical city \u2013 Kahunsha \u2013 or recount whimsical stories (\"So he made up his mind to achieve something so wonderful that if he were to tell anyone his life story, it would take days to tell, even weeks, and the ending would be a happy one\u2026\"), he betrays one significant limitation. He is unable to make the connection between storytelling and lying \u2013 both fabrications \u2013 unlike Sumdi who uses storytelling (lies) to win over the taxiwalla, or as a secret weapon against Anand Bhai. Again, Sumdi\u2019s character is more complex: Sumdi allows himself to be mesmerized by Chamdi\u2019s story of The Boy Whose Ribs Became Tusks, as a temporary panacea for the pain of his miserable existence, yet he knows full well it\u2019s just a temporary reprieve from his condition, just like the alcohol & drugs (& even sex) of the adults\u2019 world he warns Chamdi against. Which is why Sumdi soon \u2018forgets\u2019 Chamdi\u2019s story, much to Chamdi\u2019s dismay. Chamdi himself is still living in the delusion of the story, while Sumdi has moved on. One wonders why Chamdi is not as preoccupied with fabrication (both storytelling, and outright lying) as a \u2018mortal sin,\u2019 as is the case with the other two Christian precepts that bring to light time and again the existential dilemma \u2013 that of the disparate realities between the ideal world of the orphanage and the complex realities on the streets of Bombay. Unfortunately the problematic point of view manifests itself in the novel\u2019s climactic passage. The events of that scene are too engulfing and momentous to have any real impact on Chamdi the lost boy. What the reader imparts from that scene is very different from that something (if anything) understood by the character himself. Thus the story\u2019s conclusion fades away, like the sunset view from the Gate of India, and it\u2019s difficult to place Chamdi\u2019s character in context. What opens the story (the discovery of free will) and the climax (the inconsequentiality of free will, and the triviality of moral arguments involving right versus wrong vis-a-vis the struggle to remain alive), cease to have any real structural meaning \u2013 there is no narrative resolution - when juxtaposed against \u2018the horror the horror\u2019 imparted on the reader: the relentless poverty and human cruelty that has become an integral element of the economic & political fabric of the megalopolis."}, {"userName": "Ronald", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9687797-ronald", "userReview": "It is a brilliant book.

One of them was this Canada Reads book from 2007 that I had never heard of.The Song of Kahunsha is about a 10 year old orphan boy who lives in Bombay. One day he learns that the orphanage is going to be shut down, and instead of going that rout he decides to take his fate in his own hands, and sets out to find his birth father who left him on the steps so long ago.One of the great things about this book is the innocence that Chamdi has, no matter how many hardships he faces. This comes across as a child\u2019s method of coping, and it\u2019s written in a magical way that pulls the reader through his world. His world is one of heartache, pain, and violence but also one of incredibly colours, hope, and belief. He learns that the world is rough, and even though he meets up with two children around his own age, Sumdi and Guddi, things are going to get a lot harder. Together they start collecting money for Anand Bhai, who \u201cturns people into boxes\u201d. Chamdi\u2019s world is further shaken when on the day he is supposed to steal from a local temple, something terrible happens (as if enough had not already happened).Still, Chamdi finds beauty. He sees things with the eyes of a child and he\u2019s unable to completely give up his child-like ways, even though he sees evils all around him, evils that the reader understands but that the 10 year old Chamdi cannot.This isn\u2019t a happy ending book but sometimes you need something deeply emotional to shake you up a little and get you out of a reading rut.4/5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Abi Versteegh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48882593-abi-versteegh", "userReview": "The Song of Kahunsha was written by Anosh Irani, who is an Indian-Canadian novelist born in 1974. The book took place in Bombay, which is where Irani grew up, meaning he was writing based on experience. This added to the value of the novel, making it a more personal story line.The Song Of Kahunsha is about a Chamdi, a ten-year- old boy who escapes an orphanage in the city of Bombay in search of his father. Chamdi is a very harmless, quiet boy who believes the city of Bombay is \u201cKahunsha,\u201d the city of no sadness. His dream crumbles as he approaches the city and discovers the harsh environment and horrifying scenes of violence. The novel takes place in 1993, a time of racial conflicts and war-torn areas. Chamdi is welcomed by two other children living on the streets of Bombay, Sumdi and his sister, Ghuddi. Sumdi is quite brave and has a strong personality as she is able to stand up to the severe challenges she faces each day. Ghuddi is brave like her brother and does whatever it takes to survive. Chamdi takes on their lifestyle begging on the streets while working for Anand Bhai, who collects all their earnings. Anand Bhai is an abusive, greedy man who physically and emotionally punishes the young children. The novel extends, going into detail of their day to day lives of working for Anand Bhai and their plan to escape in order for survival. I had the pleasure of reading this novel for my grade 11 English final assignment, and it is an extremely well-written piece of fiction. This novel was emotional, suspenseful and is the definition of \u201cgreat literature.\u201d The novel starts out quite calm but gradually gets more intriguing and exciting. The novel goes into gruesome detail allowing the reader to visual Chamdi, Sumdi and Ghuddi\u2019s experiences which add to the quality of the novel. One part that really caught my attention was when Anand Bhai said: \u201cNow cut your tongue off, you lied to me, so hold your tongue out and slice it off.\u201d At this point, I became hooked on the storyline and was unable to put the novel down. He continues to say: \u201cI\u2019m waiting, either you do it or I'll do it. The problem with me is that I'm a perfectionist. That means I will work slow and steady and make sure that the cut is in one straight line. If not, I'll start again.\u201d Page 245. The novel will allow you to feel many emotions, and grab your attention at several parts. My favourite character was Chamdi. At first, he was very hesitant on doing the tasks he was assigned, but as the storyline progressed he developed into a brave individual who was willing to fight. He did not like to do the tasks that put his survival at risk, however, he pushed through and never gave up. He was able to put his fears behind him and move on to the next most important thing. Overall I thought this book was exceptional and a well worth read. If you chose to read the novel \u201cThe Song of Kahunsha\u201d by Anosh Irani, you will not be disappointed as it will capture your attention, trigger emotions and keep you engrossed."}, {"userName": "Sandra ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8209529-sandra", "userReview": "I had the honour to meet Anosh Irani last year, as he was promoting \"The Parcel\", which I loved.I wanted to read more of his work and grabbed a copy of \"The Song of Kahunsha\"This book is a beautiful coming of age story, with strong yet vulnerable characters.

And take that white scarf off your neck. Bombay is not a hill station!\u201d Then Samdi laughs and Chamdi feels it is a strange sight indeed, to watch this boy walk with a limp, a face black from smoke, and the widest smile in the world.Immersed in the world of destruction, violence, filth, and hunger, Chamdi, a ten-year-old orphan discovers the streets of Bombay outside of his orphanage. This gentle, compassionate story about a young boy sheds light to what 11 million orphans are facing today in India. Child labour, sexual exploitation and theft all circle around Chamdi as he tries to find his place among millions of other citizens who don\u2019t show an ounce of kindness. When he was still in the confinements of the orphanage, Chamdi imagines a city of colour that blooms with warmth and no hunger. When he takes to the streets and befriends two other seasoned street orphans he learns the way one must live without protection. After exploring every rat infested street corner through the eyes of a reader, it\u2019s easy to say that this book was intended to gauge a reaction. A typical North American student is blinded by societies distractions like Hollywood, sports, fashion, and studies to care about the outskirts of their own city. The Song of Kahunsha made me sprawl uncomfortably in the mud patch Anosh Irani left for his readers. Since Chamdi is such a young, inexperienced boy the audience is enlightened by his innocent, tender perspective on how the world is. His intentions and imagination drew me in with a delicate pull, making me develop a fond connection with a fictional character that I\u2019ll never meet. The simple, literal language used prevents readers from feeling overwhelmed by the savageries of Bombay and allow room to encompass the realism of what an unprotected child witnesses. Chamdi\u2019s struggles make him a hero for gripping onto hope even when faced with death and injustice. The colour of his imagination made me realize how pure young people are even when they have the option of giving up. The Song of Kahunsha reminded me strongly of Khaled Hosseini`s The Kite Runner, another vivid, melancholic read about the conflicts in the Middle East and how the rest of the world isn\u2019t as involved as it should be. Overall, a beautiful, yet horrifying story, this novel is suitable for anyone who has willing eyes to read about the fragility of a society and colourful scope of a young boy\u2019s endurances. \u201cChamdi slowly watches as the sun takes its place in the sky and sends its light around in a sparkling dance. Behind him, there is the sudden flutter of pigeons, as though they have all flown away at the same time. As the water gurgles bneath them, Chamdi moves closer to Guddi, and lets his hand touch hers.\u201d"}, {"userName": "\u00d0\u0251\u03b7\u03b7\u0251", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3497553", "userReview": "Regular Indian book, actually. As you probably know -the book was written after Q&A was released, which symbolized a little something I like to call \"the new Indian literary age\", I mean that at 2007-2009 Indian writers were successful among Western readers. Yet, I didn't Love this books, because it was slow- moving, and not that well written (or the translation wasn't good?).We read about the poor reality of Indian people, but this is not true. Irani presents an extremely unrealistic image of life in India and ruins it completely. Indians are NOT those poor, orphaned, strange people you see on TV shows or read about in books. I think there is a real need of book which will actually tell the average American reader what living in India really is like.The Song of Kahunsha by Anush Irani is an okay book. After the book Q&A by Vikas Swarup was released and was very succesful, many many Indian wroters decided to go for it and write a book about the poor, hopless life of poor, hopless kids in India who barely have something to eat and most of them are orphans.On one hand, this book is well written and well captured the fictional India, but it seems as if Kahunsha is actually looking for trouble and not as if the troubles finds him unready and make him even poorer and sader. You see, the writer probably wanted to make the reader feel sorry about the poor little child and buy this book just because it's trendy.On the other hand, I think this book was so pathetic and unoriginal and really trashy, you know. All through the book, the one thought was:alright, okay, we get it, he was poor and sad and a survivor, no doubt about it. And yes, some Indian kids are unluckily poor and oh I feel so sorry for him oh and that cute face of him *looking at the cover*. Well, I say: Oh, please! In fact, the author himself did a pretty good job making us understand how poor this child was: \"he froze, \"he was hungry\", \"he was alone\", \"he was jealous of other kids\"...And the whole conflict with jesus guy. Ugh.So, the whole book left me empty.

It cut very close to the bone; children trapped in suffering under a cruel hand. The depth of the emotion it evoked in me is doubtlessly linked to my own childhood and that has deeply marked me such that seeing children in those circumstnces and feeling that old pain opens primary emotions that are always overwhelming. I have always felt for children cuaght in this kind of trap and I have known many. In Cambodiain the late 90's the kids selling themselves on the street, begging and rolling drunks who were then visited by their handlers and mercilessly beaten force them to hand over whatevcer they had taken that day. It seems that this particular system of cruel exploitation is in place all over SE Asia.It struck me very deeply at the time and I felt helpless to help them. I learned then that giving them food was the only thing I could do was give them food and watch them eat it and if I was to treat their wounds or their illness it all had to be done immediatley and I had to watch medicine consumed, otherwise they had to hand that over as well because it could be sold.This book lays it all out through te eyes of a sensitive, intelligent little boy in his own words. He is gradually robbed of everything, hope and dignity and made to commit a terrible crime that locks him in guilt and shame.I struggle constantly with the the sense of the world as a threatening and evil place and the suspicion that the bulk of humanity fits the bill both so deeply ingrained in me.

His upbringing has been humble, with the same meals of rice and vegetables provided three times a day, a cot with a white sheet to sleep on, and a basic education affording him the knowledge to read and write. You can\u2019t help but feel sad for Chamdi and his situation, until the closing of the orphanage sends him to the streets of Bombay where we quickly learn things can be much worse than he had ever experienced. Chamdi\u2019s road becomes increasingly harder, as he struggles to stay alive with no food in his tummy, money in his hand or a roof over his head. His saving grace and the true inspiration of this story is Chamdi\u2019s ability to dream in colours. No matter how dark, dismal and desolate his circumstances appear to be, Chamdi need only close his eyes and dream of Kahunsha, his make believe recreation of Bombay, where there is no sadness, criminals, or starvation. This is a truly inspirational story that will not only make you thankful for all that you have, but hopeful for all that you have the power to imagine."}, {"userName": "Aban (Aby) ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802881-aban-aby", "userReview": "This is the story of a ten year old boy, Chamdi, who leaves an orphanage in Bombay to look for his father. He calls the city \"Kahunsha\" (the city of no sadness) but his dream city bears no relation to the Bombay that awaits him. Chamdi is befriended by two other children: a brother, Sumdi, and his younger sister, Guddi. They beg in order to look after a sick mother. Like all beggars, they have to give their money to a man, Anand Bhai, who controls the beggars in the area. (This book brings back memories of Rohinton Mistry's \"A Fine Balance\".) The book takes place in 1993, a time of racial conflict between Hindus and Muslims. The children fall victim to the conflict and Anand Bhai's desire for revenge.This is a grim book, reflecting the harsh reality of street life in Bombay. There's violence in it but, unlike the violence in \"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\", it is not gratuitous. Moreover, running like a silver light through the darkness, is the innocence of childhood and the genuine goodness and sweetness of Chamdi.

Chamdi ha dieci anni e vive alle porte della citt\u00e0, lontano dai violenti scontri tra induisti e musulmani, dalle moschee bruciate e dai negozi svaligiati. La sua non \u00e8 una vera casa, \u00e8 un orfanotrofio, perch\u00e9 i genitori lo hanno abbandonato appena nato. Il suo mondo \u00e8 fatto del colore acceso delle bouganville, delle canzoni, dei giochi. E delle preghiere silenziose perch\u00e9 qualcuno arrivi e lo porti via. Ma lui ha un grande sogno, che Bombay si trasformi in una citt\u00e0 senza tristezza, un luogo in cui i bambini possono giocare per le strade e in cui non ci sono figli senza genitori. Chamdi sa che quella degli orfani \u00e8 una vita a met\u00e0, i loro occhi non splendono, hanno solo una luce presa in prestito: per questo sembrano tristi anche quando ridono. Cos\u00ec decide di andarsene, di partire alla ricerca del padre, con in tasca una manciata di petali di bouganville. Perdendosi per i vicoli sporchi e affollati, Chamdi incontra Sumdi e la sorella Guddi, che per strada ci vivono fin dalla nascita. E in breve si trova a chiedere l'elemosina insieme a una spaventosa corte dei miracoli al servizio di un bandito senza piet\u00e0.
