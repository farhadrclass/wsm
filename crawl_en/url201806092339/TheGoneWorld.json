Still, it's hard to review that left you with a feeling of exhausting, wonder and dread.\n\nWithin two months of her arrival in Virginia Beach, she had time-traveled to the Terminus of humanity and sailed the farthest reaches of the Andromeda Galaxy, bathed in starlight that wouldn\u2019t touch Earth for another two and a half million years.\n\nThe book is gorgeously written, and at first, there is a tiny feeling of hope in the story, despite, the gruesome murder, as we learn more about time travel, and all the wonders with it. Then, we learn about Terminus, the end of humanity, an end that is closing in faster and faster, from being a threat generations away to a threat that seems to move faster towards each day and you start to feel that humanity may be doomed that there will be no way to stop Terminus from happening.The Gone World is a fabulous science fiction book and I felt a craving for more books like this after finishing it. I've always loved time travel, and I loved the idea of going forward to an \"if\" future to see back to how for instance a case would be solved, and then go back. It's not a new thought, but adding the Terminus, gives the book a sense of doom, a sense that nothing will, in the end, stop the end of humanity. There is hope, but will Shannon Moss, be able to figure out a way to stop Terminus? Or is she just fighting windmills?I feel that part of me is still processing this book, despite that, I finished the book a couple of days ago. It's such an extraordinary book. I also loved how the author quoted August Strindberg, from the book The Ghost Sonata, as intro quotes for new parts in the book. Love details like that. And, I need to find time to read or listen to\u00a0Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Tom Sweterlitsch!Read it, or listen to the audiobook. I have a tendency to do both when I have the chance, reading at home listening at work. Btw that's a great way to get some reading done when you don't have time. Combine listening with reading. *A tip from a Bookaholic Swede*\n\nAnd some people had left their bodies entirely, had become immortal, living as waves of light - but once they could no longer die, the immortals begged for death, because life without passage of time becomes meaningless.

On paper, her job is to investigate any criminal activities involving members of the US Navy or Marine Corps, but behind the scenes, her duties involve a whole lot more, including traveling through time to search for clues in a myriad of possible futures. It\u2019s dangerous work, and years ago she even lost her leg to frostbite while on an assignment exploring the wintry landscape of a future Earth.Moss\u2019s \u201cown\u201d time is 1997, the year she receives a case to track down a missing teenage girl named Marian whose mother and brother have been brutally murdered. The main suspect is a former Navy SEAL, who Moss discovers, with some shock, was part of the Naval Space Command program, stationed aboard a spaceship assumed lost on a classified mission. Knowing how the stresses of traveling through space and time can push a person to the edge, Moss suspects a deeper connection. Now she will need to jump ahead to a possible future Earth to see if Marian\u2019s disappearance has made any ripples, so that Moss might trace the events backwards to discover what happened to the girl.But for a while now, the NSC has also been aware of an event known as the Terminus, which will bring about the end of the world and all reality as we know it. The date of the Terminus, however, is not set; every time Moss makes the jump to the future and returns to the present, she receives news that the Terminus has moved up a few more years, drawing ever closer.This novel is a sci-fi crime thriller with time travel thrown into the mix, so you just know the story will be a little wild. It can also be quite confusing\u2014but again, that\u2019s almost par for the course when it comes to time travel fiction. Everything is connected somehow, and as readers, we must keep track of the times Moss travels to the future, how long she stays, the people she talks to, and the information she gleans. Just to make it even more complicated, every time Moss jumps forward and comes back, the future she visits \u201cblinks\u201d out like it never happened (or maybe that should be \u201cwill never happen\u201d?) and anyway, all her futures are possibilities only, not certainties. If your head isn\u2019t exploding yet, there\u2019s more: Echoes. These are individuals brought back from the possible futures, doubling someone already living. This aspect plays a big role in the story, so I won\u2019t say more on the topic. The point though, is that The Gone World is a story of many different components, which Sweterlitsch juggles like a performer spinning plates on sticks, trying to keep them all up in the air and moving at once. If you\u2019re not prepared to have your mind twisted, of if you\u2019re in the mood for something lighter, then this is not a book for you.This is also the second novel I\u2019ve read by the author, so to some extent, I knew what I would be getting in terms of the tone of the story and writing style. In a word, it\u2019s dark. Really dark. Like Sweterlitsch\u2019s first novel Tomorrow and Tomorrow, we\u2019re talking an extremely bleak worldview, where the threat of the Terminus is always present and encroaching on our minds. Some of Moss\u2019s memories and her disturbing visions also have the quality of a nightmare, and the prose frequently utilizes imagery that is once painfully beautiful and viscerally horrifying.As much as I enjoyed this novel though, there are a few caveats. The raw, gritty, and depressing mood aside, I\u2019m not sure the book got its ultimate point across successfully. The story might have lost its hold on me at the end, crushed by the weight of its own ideas and growing a little too unwieldy for the plot structure to support. As well, I still have no idea how a lot of the science or the mechanics behind the technology in the novel really work; the author doesn\u2019t make much of an effort to explain. One can argue all that is secondary to the main story, but I think it would have helped to get at least some background on the secret NSC space program and the history of how time travel was ultimately achieved.But all in all, I enjoyed this. It\u2019s smart, imaginative, and so edgy it could cut. I liked following our compelling protagonist, watching all the pieces come together (and sometimes get torn apart) against a backdrop of drama, action, and thrilling suspense. I would recommend this for time travel fiction fans and sci-fi mystery lovers, especially if you\u2019re looking for a challenging, mind-bending read.Audiobook Comments: Brittany Pressley was a wonderful narrator, successfully portraying a large cast of characters of different ages, different backgrounds, and different times. She used accents to great effect for several of them, creating a very immersive experience for the listener. She had a great voice for the book too, perfectly capturing its grim and dark tone."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "I wanted to read this because of the story that Neill Blomkamp is adapting it into a film, as well as the fact that Sweterlitsch has served as co-writer on a number of Blomkamp\u2019s Oats Studios projects. I mention this first because The Gone World, being pretty high-concept sci-fi, is not the kind of novel that would have appeared on my radar otherwise. Thankfully, Sweterlitsch is a first-rate storyteller, and though the plot is complex I found the narrative fascinating.Explaining the premise is going to make me feel ridiculous, but I\u2019ll have a go. NCIS agent Shannon Moss is part of Deep Waters, a top-secret project involving travel in space and time. One can only jump forward in time from their present day or 'terra firma', in Shannon's case 1997 \u2013 but not beyond the Terminus, 'the moment humanity ceases to be relevant'. Every timeline ends in the Terminus sooner or later, and, ominously, it's getting closer. The futures Shannon and other agents visit are only possibilities and may never happen in reality, but an agent might live for years in an 'IFT' (inadmissible future trajectory).Back in 1997, a family is massacred, and the prime suspect is the patriarch, a Navy SEAL who was also part of Deep Waters. Shannon is tasked with solving the case, and is perturbed when she finds the crime took place in a house that used to belong to her childhood best friend. The story has been described as 'Inception meets True Detective'; there's more than a little X-Files in there as well (not least because Shannon watches the show and is a Scully fan). Boiled down to a sentence, it's a time-travel whodunnit (so, Crime Traveller, basically.)The 'gone world' the title speaks of is not, as you might think, one of these IFTs, but Shannon's past, in particular the life she shared with her best friend Courtney Gimm before the latter's death at age sixteen. Touching the wall, she felt like she could tear the present world away and see her friend again, be with her friend as if no time had passed, as if she could step into the old bedroom, the gone world. The device of grounding Shannon's motivation in Courtney's death works really well, both because it humanises the character and because it keeps bringing the story back to a recognisable context. No matter how outlandish the rest of it becomes, there's always this element of ordinary humanity.It's safe to say The Gone World is outside my reading comfort zone, but this was a gamble that paid off. It's very well paced, and while everything was explained, I never felt like I was getting bogged down in the intricacies of how it all worked. Turns out, murder mystery and time travel go surprisingly well together.(There's one thing I hated about it, though \u2013 the epilogue. I hated that epilogue so much I don't even know how to begin talking about it. Let's pretend it never happened.)I received an advance review copy of The Gone World from the publisher through Edelweiss.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Juli", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli", "userReview": "Deep Space. Deep time. In the future there isn't much in the universe outside of the reach of humanity.....even time. Shannon Moss is part of a secret branch of the NCIS that travels in time, investigating possible futures and the Terminus....an event in the future that might cause the end of humanity. They want to learn how to prevent Terminus, but they also discover that time travel has some very real physical and mental costs. In 1997, Moss joins a police investigation into the brutal murder of a mother and two of her children. Moss is familiar with the house -- years ago her best friend lived there. A Former NavySEAL who disappeared during a time travel mission years before is the main suspect in the grisly murders. The dead woman's 17 year old daughter is missing. As she travels in time to find facts about the murders, the missing girl and the crazed suspect, Moss also discovers horrifying facts about Terminus. Wow! This book is an awesome mix of Sci-fi and suspense thriller! The story sucked me in right away and I couldn't stop reading! The plot has intricate layers....flipping back and forth in time....but Sweterlitsch's powerful writing keeps the story under control, making it thrilling and not confusing. Moss is an excellent main character....gritty, intelligent and determined. I definitely recommend this book for lovers of Sci-Fi, suspense and thriller novels. It's an exciting read.

Beautifully written, deeply layered, and most importantly mind-boggling. It\u2019s a procedural detective story about a NCIS investigator Shannon Moss looking into a brutal bloody murder of a family in a house where her best friend from childhood had once lived. But, it\u2019s not just any police procedural because Moss is part of a secret program whereby the investigators can inject themselves into the stream of time and space seeing what the future has wrought. Time travel is always interesting and here it\u2019s downright fantastic. Yes, there are two paths you can go by but it\u2019s not too late to change the road you are on. Indeed, there are infinite paths into infinite futures which becomes quite maddening. And, not to be left out, besides murder, mutiny, space travel, time travel, alien life forms, conspiracy, time paradoxes, and more, it\u2019s the story of the impending end of the world and whether it\u2019s destiny or alterable.

I loved the concept of the story but didn\u2019t totally love the execution. I am always intrigued with time travel, and I felt that the portion of the book dealing with that was fabulous. Sweterlitsch clearly researched and thought through that concept and executed it very effectively. What I didn\u2019t like as much was the length (the book would have benefitted from significantly more editing), the intricate scientific detail and the overly complex plot. I felt I had to be hyperly focused on the book every time I read, or I would lose track of the various story lines. Overall, The Gone World is an interesting and original tale that you must be prepared to devote your entire attention to as you read it and not spread it over too many days.

This book transcends genre and I have never read anything remotely similar to this - despite the fact that I\u2019ve read 140 books a year since my early teens. In this book we meet special agent Shannon Moss. In her teens, she lost her best friend in a grisly murder. As an adult she travel to possible futures, \u201cIFT\u2019s\u201d, inadmissible future trajectories, to look for clues to solve crime. The murder of a family in Shannon\u2019s dead best friend\u2019s house is a crime that requires explorations into possible futures. There is another pressing problem too - every time someone travels to an IFT, the end of the world looms closer. It turns out that this event, Terminus, is connected to the murders Shannon is investigating.There is a lingering sense of loss and longing in this book that resonated so deeply that I felt compelled to grant this a five stars rating - something I do very rarely. I haven\u2019t felt for any character like I did for Shannon for a long time. The story itself is sprawling and magnificent. You do not have to be a SF fan to read this.

I loved this book. It was complicated, mind-blowing, fascinating and just so damn fun. Not to mention a little scary, but in the best way. This book is heavy on the science and physics but that was one of the reasons I loved it. \nI have no idea how to explain this plot. I'm not going to lie, it is super confusing. At least, the more you try to explain it, it is. I'll give it a go. Shannon Moss is part of a top-secret division of NCIS that has the ability to travel forward in time but never after the Terminus, a seemingly unavoidable future that results in the end of the world. It's a possible future that happens in every future they travel to, but at different times. In fact, the end keeps getting closer. In her present day, Terra Firma (1997) Shannon Moss is investigating the murder of the Mursult family and the disappearance of Marian Mursult. The prime suspect being Patrick Mursult, a former Navy Seal who is identified as being part of a missing vessel called the Libra. Libra was part of a project called Deep Waters. She is sent into the future to investigate the crime and missing person's case in hopes of learning enough to prevent it. During this process, she discovers...more. Everything is connected and Shannon is determined to find how or if she can prevent the Terminus. This book blew me away. There was nothing about this book I didn't like. The science was complicated but well explained. There were a few times that the book lost me, but oddly enough, I kind of enjoyed it. It was original, thought-provoking and as far from predictable as possible. The subject of time travel inevitably brings up things like fate and whether the future can truly be altered and I thought it was handled well. As far as the science goes, it was complicated but even properly explained time travel can be confusing. The book addressed so many aspects of time travel that are usually ignored, simple things like the resulting mental stress or even the issue of aging. Every part of the plot is connected and interwoven and each time I thought I had a handle on where the book was going, the rug was pulled out underneath me. I loved it. At this point, I might as well pull out a thesaurus and see if I can come up with any more ways to say fascinating, mind-blowing, and original.

On one hand, it was absolutely breathtaking in it\u2019s scope and imagination. On the other, I never had the desire to read the book for more than fifteen or twenty minutes at a time. So, obviously something wasn\u2019t quite clicking there. In fact, even though I was super curious to see how he was going to wrap things up with Terminus, I had to force myself to sit down and finish the book at one point. And that just didn\u2019t sit right with me because there\u2019s no reason I should have been so blase about reading the book. It really is gorgeously written.The ideas and imagery Sweterlitsch uses in The Gone World will stay with me for a long time. They\u2019re nothing extremely new, but the way he tweaks them gives them staying power. The Vardogger tree, the cabin in the woods, Shannon\u2019s scenes with Nestor. They all ink themselves upon your mind\u2019s eye. The author has a way with words at times that paint the scene so realistically it feels like you can step right into it. I can see why so many people absolutely adore this book. I think that when I find time to give it a re-read (which I fully intend on doing) I\u2019ll like it better the second time around. Every time I think about this book, I feel this sense of melancholy settle down around me thinking about what the main character went through.Of course, it cannot go without mentioning that The Gone World\u2018s main character is a female amputee. Of even more importance, she is actually hindered by her leg. The author didn\u2019t take the quick and easy way out and give her a disability that is overcome within a few pages. Her disability is something she deals with daily in the course of almost everything she does \u2013 and yet she still manages to do almost everything anyways. This is the type of disabled character that makes me cheer.Overall, this is gloriously imaginative, definitely depressing, and filled with scenes that you won\u2019t be able to easily forget. Gone World didn\u2019t quite hit it out of the park for me, but I\u2019m definitely more inclined to say it was a case of \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5472603-debbie", "userReview": "WTF?

I've read several new sci-fi suspense novels with similar themes this year, including\u00a0\nDark Matter\n and\u00a0\nArtemis\n, but I have to say this book really blew those books out of the water for me.The book follows Shannon Moss, who works for a mysterious agency within the government known as the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). She has been charged with solving a horrific murder involving an agent's family, one that may make your stomach turn if you aren't a fan of reading gritty details. We learn that the agent's murder is linked to an event known as\u00a0 the Terminus. Terminus refers to a date in the future where humanity is brutally killed by an unknown force, which Moss' unit (NCIS) is racing to understand. Moss' unit has mastered the ability to travel through time, also known as Deep Time, in order to investigate how the agent is linked to Terminus, and if the unit can potentially stop Terminus from decimating all of humanity.Every time Moss travels to the future, she experiences alternate futures. As the author explains, \"Which wormhole out of that turbulent foam the Grey Dove penetrated was just a matter of chance, each tunnel to a distinct tine of the future multiverse.\" Moss travels on her own ship, also known as Grey Dove. She sees that her lover in one future could be her enemy in another. She discovers that some friends remain true friends in every timeline. Moss' present is set in the late 1990s, but every time she returns she ages due to the time she spent in the future, confusing the few loved ones around her.This novel can be a bit complex times, but I never struggled to follow it even when I had been away from it for a few days. I was especially impressed with the author's character development and world building. Yes, some of the book's premise and mixture of genres may seem a bit far-fetched (and of course it is, because this is sci-fi!), but the author's attention to detail and the characters' motivations helps walk the reader through the nuanced story, and makes the reader care about what happens to the characters. The prose is beautifully composed, with luscious descriptions of the environment and characters. Here's a snippet of one of my favorite quotes from the book:\n\"Moss remembered her first dreamlike glimpse of sunlight glaring off the hulls of the NSC fleet in space, like a spill of diamonds on black velvet - a sublimity few other people have witnessed.\"\nThank you to the author, Tom Sweterlitsch, the publishing company, Penguin Group (USA), and Edelweiss+ for an advanced reader copy of\u00a0The Gone World.

Then the next chapter presents a murder mystery that takes place in the eighties which also had me intrigued. I don't want to give away anything from the plot because I hate when reviewers do that. So I will just give my recommendations.If you like time travel, this is for you.If you like smart story lines that are well written, this is for you.If you like end of the world story lines, yup this is for.Oh, and the alien world is so original, so yeah, this is for you sci fi geeks.I'm really excited about this author. I will be reading his other works."}, {"userName": "S", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19198778-s", "userReview": "I kept reading, waiting for it to get better (hoping!)... and then it was over. Dang.This book had some interesting concepts - the time/space travel, the freaky particles. But there were just too many flaws:~How did she never run into herself? ~It was just too implausible that you would be expected to go live an entire separate life for however long you wanted, in the course of an investigation... this was beyond deep cover, and yet there seemed to be no standards around it. She also didn't seem to follow any rules or regulations, which made for a not-very-plausible law enforcement character.~Was it trying to be a horror story too? Or was it just poorly put together? Sometimes the violence made sense, but it was often just gratuitously gross.~Character development was weak. I understand that we are all less consistent than we believe, but it sure seemed like the same character was a completely different person depending on the timeline she was in.~The evil corporations and greedy politicians were at fault for the world ending. Cliche.~And most of all: how/why would alien particles care what religion you were? That as the reasoning behind the twisted forms of torture just made less than no sense to me.There are too many better books with similar elements to waste your time on this one!Try:The Mythago Cycle by Robert Holdstock - These are fantasy rather than SF, but they really get to the whole recursive reality thing in a way that this book never achieved.The Fold: A Novel by Peter Clines - gets to many of the same ideas as in this story, but MUCH more entertaining.Sleeping Giants by by Sylvain Neuvel, if you are looking for similar technology and protagonist , but with more of an alien bent.And lastly, Dark Matter by Blake Crouch, for a good exploration of the dark side of alternate realities and alternate selves."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5737182-kate", "userReview": "An excellent mindboggling and jawdropping time-travelling thriller. Rich in conundrums and paradoxes, with some really intriguing concepts regarding the nature of reality and existence.

She was such a loser most of the time, just being thrown around like a puppet. She was also bad with a gun like all the time.So the bottom line is that I'm impressed with the book, but I can't say that I truly enjoyed it.

It had such a fantastic story line and I'm a sucker for strong female characters. However, this novel and I just didn't work well. I found it a bit slow at times, which stopped me from really getting into the story. I also found that the way it was written was very confusing; there were too many details and names thrown out there and it became hard for me to keep track of everyone. And that was just in the first few chapters! I really liked the concept behind this story, and the tie-in with the mystery and science fiction elements. However, the writing style made this confusing and hard to get into. A lot of other people have read this book and have very positive reviews on it, so I would encourage anyone who is a fan of this author or who likes mysteries/sci-fi to give this novel a shot!\u00a0Thank you to Penguin Random House and the First to Read program for this ARC in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52826068-kevin", "userReview": "Fascinating premise and a strong plot but it's endlessly confusing.

And I hate not finishing books. But this just really not my thing. It has such an interesting premise, a mix of crime mystery and time travel sci-fi. Unfortunately, I was completely lost the entire time I was reading. I was confused by all the characters and the perspective, and the pace was just really sluggish. There was also a lot of terminology that was a little lost on me, and overall I felt like I was reading the words, but nothing was quite sticking. The writing style is quite unique; there are lots of run-on sentences or fragments, and while I do understand that it's stylistic, it makes the book a little harder to read."}, {"userName": "Roxanne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870392-roxanne", "userReview": "Part of me wants to rate this a 3, but on the other hand this an amazing mind blowing time traveling crime story."}, {"userName": "Darren King", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21996173-darren-king", "userReview": "I read this book after finding it mentioned on lists as having some similar elements to the Southern Reach Trilogy -- which I thoroughly enjoyed.

I enjoyed Dark Matter, but I feel Sweterlitsch went a step further. Crouch did a great job telling a story that dove into theoretical worlds involving parallel lives, but Sweterlitsch said YOLO and really went for it. This is a story where you need to strap on your brains turbo drive, and ram it full of cafinated sympathetic awakenings, but the payoff is fantastic. He tells an amazing story which is impossible to predict the next steps, because who knows where the next turn of fate will come, since you know, your screwing around with it! The plot and the ideas which are introduced are fascinating and frankly I think this would be an amazing film or series. It's filled with so much rich visual textures and moments it almost begs for the screenplay loved it. I'm stopping here, because #nospoilers."}, {"userName": "Jarmo Tuisk", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24608963-jarmo-tuisk", "userReview": "Inception on selle k\u00f5rval nagu Winnie Puhh.

The Gone World follows a special agent into a savage murder case with grave implications for the fate of mankind. \nShannon Moss is part of a clandestine division within the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. In Western Pennsylvania, 1997, she is assigned to solve the murder of a Navy SEAL's family--and to locate his teenage daughter, who has disappeared. Though she can't share the information with conventional law enforcement, Moss discovers that the missing SEAL was an astronaut aboard the spaceship U.S.S. Libra--a ship assumed lost to the darkest currents of Deep Time. Moss knows first-hand the mental trauma of time-travel and believes the SEAL's experience with the future has triggered this violence. Determined to find the missing girl and driven by a troubling connection from her own past, Moss travels ahead in time to explore possible versions of the future, seeking evidence or insight that will crack the present-day case. To her horror, the future reveals that it's not only the fate of a family that hinges on her work, for what she witnesses rising over time's horizon and hurtling toward the present is the Terminus: the terrifying and cataclysmic end of humanity itself.Luminous and unsettling, The Gone World bristles with world-shattering ideas yet remains at its heart an intensely human story.", "title": "The Gone World", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33413556-the-gone-world", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1500302928l/33413556.jpg", "reviews": 351, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6981174.Tom_Sweterlitsch", "name": "Tom Sweterlitsch"}], "type": ["Science Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33413556-the-gone-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34643289-the-gone-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35501365-the-gone-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35491954-the-gone-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693738-tomorrow-and-tomorrow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17561792-something-wicked-anthology-vol-two", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39696883-mystery-tribune-issue-n-4", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
