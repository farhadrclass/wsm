WOW! WOW!THE PACE WAS FRANTIC! EDGE OF THE SEAT STUFF!A TOTALLY GRIPPING, ACTION PACKED THRILLER! What the hell just happened? I'm a member of the GR group  A Good Thriller  and in October this year they started a concept called \"Book Pal\". The key purpose of Book Pal is to help members attack that overwhelming \"To Be Read (TBR)\" shelf by assigning a random partner each month to choose a book for you to read from that shelf. This month I was teamed with  Juliana  from the UK who had just started to read Ice Station and, given this had been sitting in my home library unread since 1999, we thought it was an excellent opportunity for me to read it as well. OMG! What an amazing experience. I haven't been so entertained like this for a long time. I was neck deep in this book from start to finish. It did not disappoint. This is not my usual line in escapism, but Reilly's talent for coming up with ingenious new twists on every page is awesome. I kept telling myself \n\"I'll get to the end of this chapter and then I'll go and do X\"\nbut damn it, every chapter finished on such an adrenaline high, I simply had to read the next one to find out what happened!All the various plot pieces revealed throughout the story were seamlessly woven together by the end, and Reilly's dastardly collection of marines, psychos and sadists were so astutely portrayed that I felt like I personally knew every one of them.The story begins at Wilkes Ice Station, a US research facility about nine hundred miles from McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Wilkes Ice Station is essentially a great, big, vertical cylinder that has been bored into the ice shelf. It dives five storeys straight down, all the way to sea level. Indented at regular intervals on the walls of the cylinder are metal catwalks which run around the circumference of the cylinder. Branching out from each catwalk, burrowing into the icy walls themselves, are a series of tunnels which form the different levels of the station.Wilkes Ice Station from the insideAfter two diving teams at Wilkes Ice Station are killed following their discovery of what appears to be an alien spacecraft, the station sends out a distress signal. A team of eleven United States Recon Marines, led by thirty two year old Shane \"Scarecrow\" Schofield, is dispatched to secure the station. Upon arriving they find that French scientists from a nearby French research station have already arrived. But all is not what it seems and some of the French are revealed as soldiers, who are also after the \u2018alien spacecraft\u2019 discovery. A bloody and gruesome battle ensues whereby all of the French soldiers are killed, and Schofield loses three members of his team, with a further two seriously injured. So much for both countries belonging to NATO, eh?\n\"International alliances are not about friendship. They are about advantage. If friendship brings advantage, then friendship is desirable. If friendship does not bring advantage, then perhaps merely civil relations may be all that is necessary.\"\nSchofield decides to send a marine dive team of three down below the ice to find the supposed alien spacecraft. They are also joined by one of the scientists from Wilkes Station. But all hell breaks loose once they\u2019re gone. One of the two injured marines is killed, Schofield himself is shot and left for dead, and the second injured marine is also set upon. There is a traitor in Schofield\u2019s team, a member of the Intelligence Convergence Group (ICG), whose sole purpose is to infiltrate elite American military units to keep tabs on them and make sure they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. Once the job is complete however, the ICG infiltrator is then tasked with \u201cerasing\u201d or wiping out the unit such that no knowledge about the assignment is leaked. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, the team learns of a pending nuclear attack by the French, as well as a land attack by the British SAS. Everyone wants to secure the spaceship discovery for their country.And so the battle begins!!!!One of Schofield's team peers through the window from a hovercraft vehicle, as troops do battleThroughout this book Reilly delivers cliff-hangers galore! The laws of science are sometimes shunted aside to make way for improbable weaponry and impossible situations, but that's just part of the fun. One thing's for sure\u2026I now know I want an Armalite MH-12 Maghook for christmas! Read the book and you'll know why! :-)))I LOVED THIS BOOK. DEFINITELY AN AUTHOR I WANT TO READ MORE OF.A solid 5 stars!About the AuthorMatthew Reilly was born in Sydney, Australia, in 1974. He is the international bestselling author of twelve novels: Ice Station, Temple, Contest, Area 7, Scarecrow, Hover Car Racer, Hell Island, Seven Ancient Wonders, The Six Sacred Stones, The Five Greatest Warriors, Scarecrow and the Army of Thieves and The Tournament.Matthew ReillyPublished in late 1998, Ice Station was an instant hit, delivering a new style of action thriller to Australian readers. It was snapped up by major publishers in the US, UK and Germany.Matthew Reilly has been quoted as saying:\n\"Ice Station was a direct response to Hollywood action movies. I figured that when you make a movie, you are limited by your budget. Put simply, it costs big dollars to make big action scenes. But when you write a book, you can create the wildest and biggest action scenes you like and it doesn\u2019t cost you a cent. The only limit is the limit of your imagination!\"\nLife hasn't always been happy for Matthew. In early December 2011, while Reilly was in South Australia on a book tour promoting Scarecrow and the Army of Thieves, his wife Natalie, who had suffered from anorexia and depression, committed suicide. Matthew could not write for a very long time following this.An Australian TV program, \"Australian Story\", caught up with Matthew in February 2014 to find out how he is doing. Attached below is a link to a very moving 30 minute interview with Matthew, his publishers and his family/friends.http://www.abc.net.au/austory/special...Photos\u2014Photo 1 courtesy of Clan McPherson\u2014Photo 2 courtesy of PC Power Play\u2014Photo 3 courtesy of Daily Mail\u2014Photo 4 courtesy of Mama Mia"}, {"userName": "Dirk Grobbelaar", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3102740-dirk-grobbelaar", "userReview": "Killer Whales? Seriously? Even in a society desensitized by the escapades of James Bond, this kind of thing seems rather excessive in an action thriller, although I must say the scenes in question were pretty scary in a \u201cJaws\u201d kind of way. Oh, and of course, giant seals. Par for the course in this kind of fiction, eh? The book\u2019s pacing is frenetic, which helps, since all the \u201cnot so good\u201d bits flash by so fast that you almost don\u2019t realise they\u2019re even present. Just how over the top is this book? Ha. Read it and see. Shane \u201cScarecrow\u201d Schofield might be a Marine, but he would not be out of place in a superhero comic, wielding his maghook with a finesse that will make Batman green with envy. Ribs crack, blood spills and limbs are lost, but the heroes in this outing keep on coming back for more. Oorah!\u2026at some point in the proceedings I became aware of the fact that I was enjoying myself, even though all reason or common sense had long since fled. You can\u2019t take a book like this too seriously, and that is perhaps a saving grace. Stick with it, laugh, cringe, enjoy! It\u2019s more akin to playing a video game than reading a novel, but you might well end up buying the sequel too.In the end I\u2019m not sure where to classify this book. It\u2019s certainly an action novel, but there are smatterings of Science Fiction and Horror (albeit of the B-grade kind) as well. Conspiracy Theory. Murder Mystery. Hell yeah! It was actually quite a bit of fun, all told. Another plus: the villains in this book aren\u2019t from Eastern Europe, Africa or the Middle East, which was kind of refreshing.This book is for people who like big explosions, ridiculous coincidences and a Chuck Norris approved protagonist.

And then...I put it down!And then -- I. Picked. It. Back. Up.Again.Just to see how it ended!!!!I couldn't actually finish the book. Gave up on page 500. The beginning was great, but things rapidly dissolved into stupidity. This calls for more than suspension of disbelief. Maybe a pre-frontal lobotomy. Or maybe a time machine. I could travel back in time and give this book to my 14-year-old self, who would probably enjoy it. Though a pre-frontal lobotomy might still be necessary.Give credit where credit is due, though: in the stupid action book category, Reilly is right up there on top. He's got the mojo. There is no other way to explain 3 million books sold and a 4-star rating, although this type of success is a mystery of the same caliber as crossbow-wielding commandos, US marines shooting grappling hooks at everything that moves, and a guy who gets eye replacement surgery after having his peepers sliced in half during a razorblade torture session.My favorite part was when the hero falls off a cliff, swims through 40-foot frigid artic waves--I believe at some point he's pummeled into a cliff by them--and then somehow manages to blow up a nuclear submarine with some high explosives he had in his back pocket.Oh yeah, sorry, that was a spoiler.

This is a story in which the author has modern special forces armed with magneto-grappling-hooks and crossbows. Crossbows! Seriously? The cool thing about (early) Tom Clancy was that it was so plausible. The earnest, macho tone of Clancy's stories fit the grim Cold War setting really well. Now you have a generation of writers writing in that same earnest, macho tone about people having high-speed hovercraft battles, shooting crossbows at each other, and getting eaten by killer whales! How can you take yourself seriously when you're writing this crap?!Still, you've got to grudgingly admire any book that manages to be louder, dumber, faster, and more X-treme than even the worst (in a so-bad-it's-good sense) action films you've ever seen. 100 pages into Ice Station and I was hooked. This book really captures the fun of the great/awful action films of the 80s - back when Arnold was terminating rather than governating. And who doesn't love those movies?

So yes, it's packed with contrivance. But it's so fast paced and so fun that I'm willing to completely overlook it. I love Shane Schofield. The chips are down time and time again, and he just sighs, picks up his Desert Eagle and his anti-flash glasses, and fucks some shit up. So yeah. It's ridiculous from start to finish.

Shane Schofeild has worse luck than that guy who played James Bond in between Sean Conery and Roger More (Her Majesty's Secret Service). His best line of the movie was \"How come this doesn't happen to those other guys?\" Shane Schofield, alias \"Scarecrow,\" has a tough job. Go rescue some hot babe scientists in one of the remotest parts of the world. He and his team of Marine special warfare fighters have to go in, secure the station then wait for the rest of the corps to show up so they can claim the glory. Sounds easy right? Nothing is ever easy.Scarecrow and his team learn from the word go that nothing is easy on the butt-end of the world. The entire world seems to want a piece of the ice and for some reason they are treating the Scarecrow and his team as \"persona non gratta?\" If that ain't bad enough, only two of the scientists are hot babes. A new battlecry is born \"NUKE THE WHALES!\" This is a solid action adventure read. It's more Ian Flemming and Alistair MacLean than Clive Cussler or James Rollins. It is pure action adventure in the same vein as \"Where Eagles Dare\" and \"James Bond.\" If you want action, this book's got it. I bet you'll smell like gunpowder smoke and whale poop when you get done reading this book. The story starts in the action phase and after barely a \"how do you do\" the runaway train is leaving the station. Then, after a third of the book, he takes the time to slow things down and add in some character development. Schofield's back story is chilling. Gant (Fox) is curiously interesting and the others are strangely absent. The background of one of the most interesting characters, \"Mother\" stays a question mark. Yet we get plenty of back-story on Allison and Crawford, two pencil-necked geekoid wanna-be Berstien and Woodwards. Rielly relies on action and white hat/black hat descriptions to keep the warriors straight. Having said that, he does do the work it takes to write behavior and quirks and other things that make each character distinctive if somewhere between 2 and three deminsional. He gets an \"A\" for the difficult prospect of writing strong female characters that come across as realistic without being bitchy or needy. Even the love swooned beauty in hiding is able to keep her emotions straight while she takes care of business. I'd have liked to see him develop relationships more, though true action adventure enthusiasts might balk at the \"yuky-girl-stuff\" if he'd gone farther than he did. Unless of course there was gratuitus sex. Plot wise the pace starts fast and gets faster then settles down to regroup for another round of BOHICA (Navay Rehtoric for \"Bend over, here it comes again). The action is very fun and the lulls are necessary to gather the frayed ends the last hair raising segment left laying all over the place. I did find that, despite Scarecrow's comments that \"we can't get a break,\" he did benifit from the miraculous more than a few times though Rielly did try to write in a logical reason for them it didn't quite wash. Schofield himself bordered on uber-human while his comrades had to struggle like upper teir humans. There were also times Schoofield reminded me of the Weasly Crusher (Wessley Crusher) from Star Trek, The Next Generation. The same kind of Know-it-all-ed-ness that lead to the \"kill Wessly campaign\" by Star Trek fans that found the charracter a bit too Godly. But that's the bad stuff. For the record, most of this is standard fare for this genre and sub-genre. Rielly manages this better most. The pace is fast, furious and none of it comes easily. Add to this a really good plot that is not so complex it can't be followed, yet not so simple you can figure everything out before Scarecrow learns it. He also did a good job of hiding adversaries so you might never know where the next one is coming from. Super job there. So, why the 4 stars? So much potential. WOnderfully worked plot. Superb pace and, though I found some of it creative, the obstacles that Rielly dropped in front of Scarecrow and his team made for some exciting edge of your seat ride. Rielly also does everything the genre asks. Short of some gratuitus sex, it's all there.Great fun. Good read. I recommend it for anyone who likes military style action, complicated plots that aren't too complicated. The characters are stronger than most that this genre produces. Lacks/likes: I'd have liked to see more development of the only romantic relationship in the book, or something that more clearly established it as a sad, unrequieted love. Warnings:No nudity, no sex, lots and lots of people getting killed in creative military ways. There is even some brutality. This violence is likely managable by most mature adults and young adults, though it's likely not right for the Amish and children. It could be worse, but if rising body counts bug you this isn't for you. bottom line.

Of course, that might have made reading impossible. If you look at the reviews for the book, the word used the most, even in the positive reviews, is \"over the top.\" It's as if Reilly took every single cliche to ever grace a Steven Segal film then shook it up and poured.This is primarily set in and around an American Ice Station in Antarctica. One of the harshest, most fascinating settings on earth, and Reilly, except for reeling off a factoid or two you could pick up on Wiki, does nothing to evoke the continent's dangers or beauty. He does plunk down a 400 million year-old spacecraft on it though so that American, French and British special forces can spend hundreds of pages shooting each other or exploding things (the French using crossbows no less) over the extraterrestrial tech. It takes a true paranoid to come up with that scenario--or maybe just an Australian such as Reilly who doesn't much like any of the above. One of the blurbs refers to the book's \"blood-splattering, ultraviolent play\" and that's what it offers. What it doesn't offer is strong prose, clever plotting or characters with dimensions more third-dimensional than onion-skin paper. Also, four words: Giant Killer Mutant Seals."}, {"userName": "Paul O'Neill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17331573-paul-o-neill", "userReview": "AB"}, {"userName": "Anne  (Booklady) Molinarolo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3615945-anne-booklady-molinarolo", "userReview": "4.5 StarsWow! Matthew Reilly knows how to write a thriller that kept my heart pounding to the very end! Yes, there are a couple improbable plot twists, but Reilly makes you believe all of them. His characters are wonderful: Scarecrow, Gant, Mother, Book, et al are remarkable and memorable. Wendy was simply adorable. An adorable character in a military thriller? Yup, you just love this little fur ball. She\u2019s as brave as the leathernecks who respond to an SOS call to the American Wilkes Ice Station in Antarctica.After several scientists disappear beneath the station in a cavern estimated to be 100 million years old, Lt. Shane \u201cScarecrow\u201d Schofield and his elite Marines respond to the surviving scientists\u2019 SOS call. His mission is Reconnaissance, but the mission quickly changes, thanks to a team of French elite assassins, an escaped killer, and a traitor in his own squad. What is so valuable about the discovery below? It is thought to be an alien spaceship that visited Earth over 100 million years ago. Would the French Government actually kill for the technology? Would his own government kill for that same knowledge? Scarecrow has seen it before. His comrade, Andrew Trent, was killed by the same elite British SAS that is heading for the Ice Station. Not knowing whom he can trust and hell bent on saving the surviving scientists and his leathernecks, Schofield must find a way to get everyone to safety. It won\u2019t be easy. Solar flares and killer whales complicate his new mission: getting everyone safely back to base. Saying more about the plot would ruin this good thriller. Be prepared to read this to the end in one or two sittings, because ICE STATION will keep you entranced to the last page."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35109935-robin", "userReview": "Reread this last week and I upgraded my rating to a five star rating.

She had cancer and it was really progressing and my mum and I knew we were going over to say goodbye so it was a really sad time. Sort of happy as well because we were getting the chance to say goodbye to someone, which most people don't get but, of course, sad too. Sometimes in these moments, the right book can be the perfect medicine and \"Ice Station\" took me on such an amazing and exciting journey that when I left, I left the book behind hoping my godmother would get to read it before she passed. Some scientists are digging in ice that is millions of years old in Antarctica and testing core samples to look at the atmosphere.......Zzzzzz ......they hit metal. Why the fuck is there metal down there?? They send down to some divers to check it out who have to ride a dive bell deep deep deep under the icy water and when they reach the cavern they have only brief seconds to confirm the existence of some sort of \"space ship\" before they are brutally torn apart by monsters unseen. The peeps back upstairs do their call for help \"\"Help help fucking help all of our scientists are getting eaten and they found some fuckin space ship!! Ahhhh\"So the call goes out over an open channel and a bunch of people hear it and send the troops in. I mean, in theory, alien technology could put any country ahead of the rest of the world so what if something like that was found in a place like Antarctica, that no one really owns, or certainly if they do claim ownership cannot hope to enforce it. So what we have is a group of countries that are allies secretly killing each other to get the ultimate prize which I loved! If you are looking for some Nazi's to hate you will find nary a Nazi in this book.Shane Schofield, call-sign Scarecrow, is the leader or a marine force recon team. Lightly armoured and trained for fast insertion, intel gathering and holding the fort down until the rest of the gang arrives, the action starts straight away and never lets up. And is Reilly good at action of what. Seriously this book is all about bang and pop so don't be surprised if one second you are quite liking one of the characters, and then the next second they are destroyed by a fragmentation grenade that leaves their body shredded to the body and looking like a pin cushion. Scarecrow is the master of taking in his options and acting, using his lightening reflexes to save the day more than once and earn the loyalty of the men and women under his command. We have some awesome side characters in 'Book', the older more squat soldier who rescued Scarecrow when he was shot down as a pilot. It was this rescue that inspired Scarecrow to become the soldier and leader he is today so Book is in many ways like a father and a best friend. Then we have 'Fox' who is a cute blonde with killer skills and the object of Scarecrows affections. Then we have Mother which is short for Motherfucker. She is a giant woman who is tough as shit but is the mother of the group, looking after everyone and often throwing herself into the thick of action to save the lives of her friends. She is an unstoppable force of nature.This book has everything. Nasty frenchman, even nastier Brits, Hovercraft chases, killer whales....people being fed to killer whales,secret government agencies, a friendly seal, a nuclear reactor, monsters, invisibility, all of this but it is not really science fiction as everything is entirely plausible. This was the start of a love affair for me. I've bought every book Matthew has ever written and the scarecrow series has now grown into 4 books plus a novella. The character is on a bit of a hiatus right as Reilly rediscovers himself and his style after some personal tragedy. If you have not read it I cannot recommend it highly enough."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie", "userReview": "[all of the female Marines survive and they are awesome, so Matthew Reilly gets points in my book for all of that (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Rory Eggleston", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10938526-rory-eggleston", "userReview": "Okay, first things first: SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS. Not that there's much plot to give away.Well, I saw this book on the library shelf the other day and picked it up. I'd been feeling like some brainless action for a few days, and this seemed to fit the bill, so I happily sat down and started reading. And, at first, it was great stuff. Not in any cerebral sense, of course, but entertaining enough. I mean, come on: Antarctic research stations, mysterious metal things buried in 400 million year old ice...it was addictive!But then, about two hundred pages in, I began to have misgivings. I guess, in retrospect, I should have seen it from the very beginning, when characters are worried because of a nearby pod of orcas (in the book, only referred to as killer whales) might attack some divers. And then said pod of whales sinisterly appears and start attacking and devouring humans. That's when suspension of disbelief broke down. Because here's the thing: in all of recorded human history, orcas have only attacked humans on five or six occasions, none of which resulted in death. There have been captive attacks, but that's not the point. THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN, which Mr. Reilly would know if he'd bothered doing even a little bit of research. And the list goes on: French special ops attacking everyone with...crossbows? American special ops retaliating with...grappling hooks? A massive flurocarbon leak which makes the air extremely flammable, but also doesn't suffocate anyone. A kid who's been at the ice station for all of a week and already has a pet seal? People without pressure suits surviving below 1000 feet in Antarctic waters? And, of course, super massive, radiation-mutated elephant seals, which, for some reason, live in the center of an ice shelf. I could go on, but there wouldn't be a point. Now, I realize that this book was in no way intended to be great literature, but merely a fun action romp, but there is suspension of disbelief, and then there is suspension of disbelief which requires a full lobotomy for one to enjoy the effects. Reality seems to have completely flown the coop in this one, and it is difficult to stick with it because of this. I guess I'd suggest it for a long airplane trip, when you have nothing better to do."}, {"userName": "Skip", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1389748-skip", "userReview": "Lieutenant Shane (\"Scarecrow\") Schofield, leading a crack team of U.S. Marines is rushed to an ice station in Antartica to secure the station's discovery of what may be an extraterrestrial spaceship.

I liked the story - a simple mystery about an alien artefact found lodged thousands of feet underneath the Antarctic ice shelf. There is an excellent turn half way through (which I will not reveal) that keeps the plot believable, and the novel more tight as a thriller. It is - for a lesser part - well written and Matthew keeps it fast paced and maintains suspense through a series of literary devices and tricks. There are cliffhangers, \"mystery moments\" (this is my expression for sequences in which a character's behaviour seems odd to the reader until the reason suddenly becomes apparent), \"narrative time dilation\" (again, my words to denote a device that extends the time it takes to narrate an event and hence creates \"24\"-style real-time tension), plot constraints (external constraints that require characters to solve an issue within a certain timeframe) and some others.So that's good about it. But I said 'for a lesser part' well written\". That is an odd expression to use. Should it not be \"for the most part\"? Well yes - but only if I meant it. My edition has near 700 pages, and I think Matthew could have told his story in 300 and would not have lost anything. Why is it 400 pages longer than it needs to be? Because Matthew insists on extending fight scenes beyond anything that is remotely tolerable to a sane individual. The initial battle scene, for example, is 117 pages long. Yes, you heard right. 117. Onehundredandseventeen. An isolated occurrence? Not so. A wild chase involving a hovercraft is similarly overdone, and so are other miscellaneous action scenes dotted around the novel. The result? Unspeakable tedium. There is no psychological suspense in these plot segments and after getting through them you feel as if somebody had forced you to watch action scenes from the Transformers movies for 4 hours in a row.And the worst of this is that Matthew does this deliberately! It's not that he simply loses control over his plot, he consciously devises action scenes of this length because he thinks this is really cool. How do I know this? Because he said so himself: \"... I'd been finding that the books I was reading were too slow, or taking too long between action scenes. I also saw no reason why books couldn't have really massive action scenes, action scenes that were even bigger than those you see in blockbuster Hollywood movies.\" (\"An Australian Interview with Matthew Reilly\", in Matthew Reilly, Temple, London 2000, n.p.) Well. Like I said - 4 hours of Transformers-style robot-thrashing, rather than 30 minutes.\"Movies are constrained by budgets\", Matthew continues. \"But with books, the limit of your budget is the limit of your imagination. I like to think I have a big imagination.\" (same place). In Matthew's case, a smaller imagination would have definitely been more.Still, I sort of still liked this one, so I went to pick up Matthew's next offering, Temple, and...=> \nTemple"}, {"userName": "Conor Lyons", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8392249-conor-lyons", "userReview": "This book was the type where you can honest not put it down, i found my self on numerous occasions racing this book for hours on end. Written by a former student of St Aloysius, this book was very exciting and always a had a sudden twist around the corner. For the first 100 pages there was action, but as i continued into the later stages of the book it was non stop action, which for many people might be a bit overwhelming but personally i loved it. The characters such as Scofield was excellent he was a traditional hero character, un trusting and in difficult situations he always pulled through. Other characters such as \"Book\" were very good he was a side kick for Scofield always offering a hand when completing tasks. The way the book was written there where two scenarios going on. The Americans on the ice station, then a reporter going around to different houses interviewing people. during the book i wasn't really interested in the interviewed but by the end i realised that these were curial because they give away certain twists in the book if you pay enough close attention.
