She has an insatiable curiosity for mysteries and finding out what really happened. She's never afraid to venture into scary territory in order to find her answers either. And let me tell you, she ventures all kinds of places and meets all kinds of people. When the building she's cleaning is set on fire right after she finds some evidence the police missed and she barely makes it out in time, she's sure that something is amiss. Of course the police don't want to listen to someone who 'fancies herself Nancy Drew', so Gabby begins investigating on her own (always telling the police what she finds out of course...well, sometimes). From her only employee getting arrested to a pipe bomb left at her front door, Gabby has a lot on her plate in just a few days time. And certainly the crime scene cleaning must go on, a girls gotta eat, right? With a cast of characters for neighbors, such as Sierra the vegan animal rights' activist, Mrs. Morgan the mystery writer who hardly ever leaves her apartment, Bill newly divorced and mad at women when he's drunk, and new guy Riley who says he's between jobs, Gabby also has plenty of mystery and mayhem at home also. One thing that helps make crime and being accused of it easier, is having good friends around who will believe in you no matter what.I don't normally read mysteries, but this one caught my eye and I decided to try it. Gabby is so likeable and so funny that it made the tension of the mystery easier to bear. And it never ceased to amuse me that Gabby kept finding pieces of evidence that the police somehow overlooked. No wonder they were frustrated with her, she made me them look bad! A good mystery, great characters, and a bad-guys-lose ending, with just a smidgen of unanswered questions to make you want to read the next book. Because yes, this is a trilogy. But no huge cliff-hangers! So yay for that. :) Read it!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7265136-jennifer", "userReview": "This was a free book from Amazon... It was a hard mystery to read for a couple of reasons, the main character, Gabby, was really hard to like. She thought she knew \"who did it\" from the very beginning and wouldn't let anyone convince her otherwise. Her comments and thoughts were cheesy and annoying. Another reason I didn't like it was because it was a Christian mystery where beliefs in God were mentioned through out. I dislike reading things that seem to push beliefs upon you. I doubt I will read anymore in this series... maybe if I'm desperate, but I have A LOT of books on my 'to-read' list. :-)"}, {"userName": "Cathy Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7218096-cathy-daniel", "userReview": "I loved this book!! Unexpectedly funny!! I thought based on Gabby's profession it would be gruesome and I'm sensitive to blood but it wasn't bad at all. The only thing that kind if got on my nerves was how quickly and stubbornly certain characters would either leap to conclusions or disregard an obvious thing. I'm talking main characters. And Gabby is oh so dense in love lol.

Memo to those who are writing flirty, sassy, romancy novels: don't dish about the love interest, or obsess about the love triangle, or ask questions about How Will The Protagonist Ever Be Able To Resolve Her Problem And Work Things Out With The Love Interest? Serious eyeroll.Maybe the back text is better because this isn't a romance novel. There's enough romance to satisfy someone who likes that kind of thing, and to make the main character believable, but not so much that it makes her ridiculous. And I have a soft spot for when things don't work out with the love interest the way you think they might.The central mystery is pretty solid, the twists and reveal make sense (not too slow or sparing, and the twists arise naturally from the setup and characters), and it was as fun to read as I hoped when I got it :) What more could you ask for?"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6305718-kim", "userReview": "Another freebie with my trial Amazon Prime membership. 2.5 stars overall. The idea is fascinating, a crime scene cleaner, the person who comes after CSI, who is a CSI-wannabe, solves crimes. The plot was decent, I honestly couldn't figure out who the murderer was until the final clue, but the ending was pretty formulaic and the reason for the murder was pretty lame. The love triangle was a bit strained, and I just couldn't believe a Christian man would be in a 4 year relationship with a model-like woman in LA without marrying her, and then be interested in a complete anti-Christian woman. Anyway, not the best I've read, but certainly not the worst. I enjoyed the character's background and her honest resistance to Christianity. Overall it was a bit of Kinsey Millhone mixed with Stephanie Plum, in a CSI setting."}, {"userName": "Kalena", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12840458-kalena", "userReview": "Christian fiction/mystery. My 1st time reading Christy Barritt and I was not disappointed. Her characters are likable and quirky. I found the details about Gabby's work as a crime scene cleaner interesting although there were a number of times you are shaking your head at her decisions. The ending was not a surprise but resolved in a satisfactory way. Recommend to those who enjoy a light read and don't mind a little gore. I will definitely continue the series, but I am not rushing out to grab it right this second."}, {"userName": "Mikayla", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14064833-mikayla", "userReview": "This was SO awesome!! I'm a sucker for spy/mystery's, so seeing a Christian mystery was a chance to good to pass up. I wasn't sure what to think of Gabby right at first. I mean, she has a rather morbid job of cleaning up crime scenes. But I was quickly swept up in Gabby's amazing humor. This book made me laugh out loud several times, which rarely happens. Though Gabby is not a Christian, this book really is incredibly clean. There was only one slightly crude joke in the book, and it was not bad at all. I think the author handled Gabby's not being a Christian very well. She made it believable. The author made the characters so vivid you feel like you would know them if you ran into them on the street.I look forward to the future books, and to see what happens between the characters."}, {"userName": "Igodgirl13", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71790396-igodgirl13", "userReview": "A book I needed to read-YOU SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN!

Christy Barritt introduces us to Gabby St. Claire, a college drop-out (with one semester to go in forensics, mind you) who cleans up crime scenes to support herself and her alcoholic father. Even though her circumstances don't sound all that rosy, Gabby is a vibrant character who you can't help but fall in love with and cheer for. Somehow, Gabby and her friends find themselves in the middle of a murder investigation into the death of the wife of a man with ambition for the top seat of government, someday. Gabby can't help but get involved with the investigation after her assistant is charged with a related crime, she knows he must of been set up! With help from her neighbors, Gabby uncovers clue after clue that the police missed -- giving her little faith in Detective Parker, a man who also is an object of flirtation. But, there's another man in Gabby's life... her new neighbor, Riley... an extremely caring man with some sort of past that he isn't very forthcoming with.

Everyone has the right to his/her own beliefs, but I didn't appreciate having those beliefs shoved at me from out of (seemingly) nowhere. Aside from Gabby's having been sent from God in the eyes of her employee and his wife, faith really had no reason to be involved in this story. Aside from that, I didn't like Gabby. She was pretty annoying, really. She jumped to conclusions based on whatever fit what she wanted to believe (until the end when suddenly she knew who had really \"done it\"). How she had two men so interested in her I did not understand. She seemed to drive them both nuts (and not in a good way). The two men didn't seem all that great themselves. ....ok so I didn't really like any of the characters apparently. Maybe Bill, the drunk neighbor; he seemed funny.The only way I got through this was by skimming from about 27% until the end and only because I wanted to know if I was right as to who the \"bad guy\" was. That took entirely too long.

Fans of Janet Evonovich will love this author. Labeled a Christian mystery, it does not push the issue, but shows that it is humanity's free will that creates life's hurdles, not God. Gabby is a woman who knows hardship and disappointment. Most recently forfeiting a life as a forensic scientist to clean up crime scenes. Like Evonovich's character, she's smarter than some professionals, but continuously stumbles into trouble. Likewise, without turning on the charm, Gabby has the interest of two men -- both she irritates; both ready to rescue her.All said and done, it is Gabby who solves the murder of the wife of a political candidate as well as a second political murder later on and clears the innocent. It is Gabby who is shot at, kidnapped, and nearly blown up. In charge her two rescuers right after she captures the \"bad guy\". I suspect she had some help, at the darkest moment, from the power of prayer and perhaps a little bargaining with God."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1790184-linda", "userReview": "Thanks for introducing me to this Squeaky Clean Mystery series, Dina. I loved this first book!Gabby St. Clair had to drop out of college on her way to a forensic's degree because of family and money problems. To stay as close to her chosen vocation as possible, she opened her own business- that of crime scene cleaner. I loved Gabby's character: smart and a bit sassy while not pretentious. So as she is cleaning blood and bones off a wall where a prominent senator's wide was murdered, she starts to wonder what happened. She finds a hidden gun in the senator's home just as it goes up in smoke- arson- and she nearly dies. Soon Gabby is a target for murder. There is just enough romantic tension between Gabby and the doubting detective examining the case, and between Gabby and Riley, her beautiful new next-door neighbor who seems so laid back.

At times, I wondered if author even knew what the term \"science\" conveys. Also, the feelings that the author kept on telling us were THERE and STRONG... just didn't come through.

Gabby is a college dropout who now cleans crime scenes for a living. This is mostly an excuse for her to get near crimes and try to solve them. Which is what she attempts here. A prominent senator's wife has been murdered and investigation uncovers that the suspects, witnesses, and acquaintances alike have secrets. Gabby has been a self-professed armchair detective for so long (seriously, she gets her ideas from \"Murder, She Wrote\"), that when she finds some evidence the police missed, she's convinced she knows \"who dunnit\" and proceeds to be a nosy, stubborn, irritation to the lead detective. Oh, and also fall for him, as well as for her new neighbor who happens to be a Christian. That's the other irritating part of this book, the so called \"Christian\" guy. Who has a blonde, glitzy rich-and-famous-boss's-daughter girlfriend for 4 years (FOUR years!!!), then decides she's too high-maintenance, moves to a new town where he carries on all mysterious-like, meets Gabby and immediately starts spending almost every spare moment with her, repeatedly gets emotionally as well as physically close to her, then immediately goes right back to his previous girlfriend when she arrives and leaves town with her. Leaving Gabby the girlfriend of the narcissistic detective. He follows his eyes to his original gf and his heart to Gabby (lol). Add to that, neither of these girls are Christians and he's considered marrying both. WHAT EVEN. Newsflash: that's NOT how a Christian behaves. The only good part was the thought sprinkled throughout that people who are mad at God because of this messed-up world shouldn't be, because they're projecting their view of the bad things in this world onto God. He's not responsible for that, He didn't cause it. Humans and our bad choices did. But God is always there for us, a rescuer and comforter in the bad situations. However, this nugget was not nearly enough to redeem the book from its obnoxious heroine, ridiculous religious hero, and dumb love triangle."}], "description": "Gabby St. Claire dropped out of school on her way to completing a degree in forensic science.
