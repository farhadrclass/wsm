This book has a warehouse full of \"holy shit that's cool\" ideas that somehow manage to fit together into a phantasmagoric, adrenaline-fueled funhouse of awesome. Operation Chaose is really a fix-up novel that aggregates 5 related short fiction pieces that had been previously released separately. All of the stories are set in the same world and involve two principal characters: a werewolf named Steven Matuchek and a witch named Virginia (or Ginny). I guess this might be a good locale to fill you in on the incredible world of \u201cOperation Chaos.\u201d THE SETTING:The place is an alternative history version of Earth where:1. Magic exists and can be harnessed scientifically by means of de-magnetizing iron;2. Given the ease of harnessing such energies, magic is employed in place of many consumer products and industrial technology and scientific applications;3. The existence of God and Satan (aka The Adversary) have been proven and such knowledge has been incorporated into the fabric of society with very interesting consequences. (Note: not nearly as awe-inspiring as Ted Chiang\u2019s Hell is the Absence of God, but this aspect of the book is still terrific.)4. All manner of supernatural creature from vamps, were-[insert animal of choice...my favorite being the were-tiger], zombies (used as test subjects, cheap labor and cannon fodder), witches, warlocks, djinn, goblins and a rather large number of etc..etc..etc...Hey, I told you this was a scrumptiously delicious bit of world building. PLOT SUMMARY:The story begins with America in the middle of an alternative version of World War II. The bad guys, rather than Nazi Germany, are a Djinn-powered Islamic Caliphate that has invaded and taken over a portion of the American northwest. Our stalwart heroes and secret government operatives, Steve and Ginny, meet as they\u2019re recruited to undertake a mission to prevent the invaders from unleashing an incredibly powerful Afreet that had previously been imprisoned in a bottle by King Solomon. In subsequent stories, the two battle fire elementals, an incubus and even travel to Hell itself, sans any political muckraking, Italian guides with a gift for bizarre imagery. THOUGHTS:Overall, this is barrels of fun to read and one I recommend without reservation. That said, there is a fair amount of \u201cokay\u201d mixed into the outstandingness. However, the \u201cmeh\u201d is in a significantly lower weight class than the large, heavyweight amounts of \"I love it.\" THE GOOD: As the brief summary above may gently hint, the world-building in this story is OFF THE CHARTS awesome. In fact, the whole first story about the Afreet where the background is largely explained is worthy of 5 stars on its own. The combination of supernatural elements and everyday life and technology is brought together effectively and is incredibly well done. For example:**Burying a loved one after death is a felony as corpses are re-animated to be used in zombie squads for everything from road building to front line combat.**Traveling by broom (or magic carpet) is standard and just about every form of supernatural creature is involved in one way or another with the war effort (except of course fang-bangers whose (i) weakness to the sun or UV light makes them too easily killed by the enemy and (ii) their \u201cblood lust\u201d can cause them to turn on their own men if not kept adequately supplied). **Other very interesting touches include the creation of technology to assist in magical applications. For example, in the book Polaroid produces a camera that mimics the light of the full moon and allows Steve to transform into wolf form at will. The number of clever ideas that Anderson jams, crams and stuffs into this very short book is nothing short of jaw-dropping. Given how fanguyish I am about quality world-crafting, I was as happy as Pooh Bear with a big ole honeypot absorbing all the incredibleness of the stories. THE NOT SO GOOD: The characters in all of the stories, including Steve and Ginny, are pretty flimsy and act as nothing more than set pieces for the world-building. I never found myself invested in what happened to them and so any sense of dramatic tension was lost on me. For some tales where the emotional aspect is critical this would be a much larger boo boo and would require a harsher rating. However, here is it only \u201cnot so good\u201d rather than bad because for this story characterization is less important as the ideas and world building are intended to carry the load. And believe me, they do indeed carry the load. Overall, 4.0 stars based on outstanding world-building, amazing ideas and concepts, interesting plots and weak characterization.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "Their child has been kidnapped by a demon from a universe with highly non-Euclidean geometry, so they summon up the spirits of Riemann, Bolyai and Lobachevsky to assist them and then head off through the transdimensional portal to get her back.

I have always been impressed with his story telling skills but I can whole heartedly agree with their first part, he comes up with original and well thought out fantastic and science fiction ideas. Operation Chaos was first published in 1971 but was put together from short stories first released in the fifties and sixties. Anderson introduces a world where magic and technology live side by side and the global community is a conglomerate of science and the arcane. Piers Anthony started publishing his Xanth novels in the mid seventies, Orson Scott Card first published the Alvin Maker books in the mid eighties, Phillip Pullman\u2019s Golden Compass series began in the early nineties and the Harry Potter books came out in the mid nineties. Anderson was decades ahead of other writers in this same hybrid genre. Operation Chaos follows the exploits of a werewolf and a witch as they fight in an alternate World War II and beyond. Some recurring themes of libertarianism break through, this is Poul Anderson after all, and even some erudite and untimely discussion of Gnosticism, as well as a trip to the \u201chell universe\u201d, and overall it is very original, humorous, and entertaining. This was dedicated to Robert A. Heinlein and there is also a red haired character named Virginia."}, {"userName": "Werner", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903390-werner", "userReview": "Years before we read this book, Barb and I had read and greatly liked Poul Anderson's The High Crusade, and I'd read and liked a few of his short stories. But this book wasn't on my radar, and I'd never have discovered it but for a recommendation from a Goodreads friend back when I was new to this site. I've forgotten now who my benefactor was; but on the strength of that recommendation, I put the book on my BookMooch wishlist, and eventually got a copy. Last month, when I was looking around for a stand-alone read for our next \"car book\" (so as not to get tied up into another long series --it's possible to have too many of those being juggled at once!) I selected this out of one of the TBR piles. It was a good pick; I liked it even better than our first Anderson novel!The latter, of course, is a science fiction genre classic. This one, however, is an example of Anderson's fantasy. We're in an alternate mid-20th-century U.S. here, in a world where magic, though dormant since the Bronze Age, somehow reasserted itself around the turn of the 20th century, and became the major force (rather than technology --although here technology adapts to and works with it) that revolutionized modern society, industry and daily life. (For instance, rather than using cars, people travel by broomstick or magic carpet.) The magical system is normally incantational, manipulating impersonal and morally neutral paranatural forces in the world (but the villains may also invoke demonic powers). It's also a world where science has demonstrated and accepted the reality of Deity, the afterlife, atonement, moral law, and the angelic and the demonic, without establishing (or denying) the truth of any particular theistic creed. That represents our hero/heroine's take on the spiritual (and apparently Anderson's as well) --and it's a theme taken seriously here.Steve and Ginny, the aforementioned H/h, are, respectively, a werewolf (Anderson's werewolves, like Anthony Boucher's, are simply people who can shapeshift into wolves --that doesn't make them vicious or madly homicidal) and a white witch. When we first meet them, they're Army officers serving in World War II --but in this reality, the Allies' main adversary is a restored, brutal Islamic Caliphate (considered heretical by some other Moslems) that's out to conquer the world and impose its version of theocracy. (This book was published in 1971; it's interesting to see how subsequent history has developed in the Middle East, with ISIS, etc.) And of course this is a war in which magic is the principal weapon employed by both sides. At the book's outset, our co-protagonists are tasked with a probably suicidal mission that's vital to the war effort, and from there the action and the jeopardies continue thick and fast. But their real battle is much bigger than the war, and the real Adversary isn't the Caliphate. Who is he? Well... he's our Adversary, too.Steve serves as our narrator; Anderson uses the conceit that he's in a trance state, communicating across the ether between alternate realities to share the benefit of his experiences with any receptive inhabitants, who share a common cosmic struggle and destiny. IMO, that device works well. The author's prose style is conversational, but erudite, with a rich substratum of dry, dead-pan humor in the way things are phrased and the matter-of-fact acceptance of how magic permeates daily life. But this is also a serious book, with lethal violence and life-and-death (or worse) danger, defining moral choices, real psychological depth in places, and an underlying spiritual and social message(s) that's as serious as a heart attack. Anderson's solid knowledge of worldwide mythology and occult lore enriches the tale, as does his accurate understanding of Gnosticism and its significance. Steve and Ginny are characters readers can readily like, admire and root for. Bad language here is limited to an occasional h- or d-word, and there's no unwholesome sexual content.All in all, I found this a great read, from a master writer at the top of his game. (Barb greatly liked the book, too!) My appetite is officially whetted to read more of his work --hopefully a lot more!"}, {"userName": "Mary Catelli", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21198579-mary-catelli", "userReview": "I like the frame on this one. They are projecting his story outward in case there are alternate universes out there, to warn us. He discusses what he probably has in common with the recipient -- but you should hang on, even if you know how steam boilers work or who won World War II, because too much information is better than too little.Then he talks about his part in the push near Oregon. . . yup, you don't know who fought World War II, or where. But our hero, being a werewolf, is pulled in on a special mission; they are sending a witch and her familiar into the enemy camp to deal with an afreet that the opposing forces are about to let loose from its Seal of Solomon. And when he is wounded and unconscious at one point, he has a dream encounter with a powerful and evil being. And dismisses it as a hallucination of some kind while he gets on with it.The witch, named Ginnie, and he deal with that, end up going to college after the war -- where a prank goes very wrong -- and marrying -- and they have an uncanny encounter on their honeymoon.It is after this, and the birth of their daughter, however, that they learn that there was indeed a thread tying together these things, and that its consequences are even worse for them than they had realized. They have to face up to a bigger foe than ever before.A tale involving stained glass windows, a horrendous stench, a ruined castle, a cat named Svartalf, brownies who get revenge for what Svartalf does, flying carpets, two dead geometers, and other wonders."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron", "userReview": "I read this book in the 70s and have (without knowing the title) been holding it up as a deft mingling of science and fantasy.

I forget how many times I've happily reread it. It's four connected stories with interludes woven into an episodic novel. Great fun, set in a world where magic became a science after 1900, so up to 1900 it shares a common history with our world then takes a sharp turn left. It echoes the attitudes of the 1960s and 1970s vis-a-vis family, women, and work but presents a very strong woman in the heroine. The cover of my copy is rather cheesy and not what Ginny would have worn, but it does reflect her personality. I found out that a sequel was written in the 1990s, Operation Luna, and hope to get hold of it soon. I definitely recommend this book to people who enjoy a mix of fantasy, alternate history and math. Watch out for two famous 19th-century mathematicians who make an appearance!

Drawn together by need and love, this husband/wife team battle elementals and demons\u0097but a darker threat may hide behind their enemies. A series of short stories drawn together in one volume, Operation Chaos has an unusual and promising take on science-fantasy, but it's altogether unconvincing and plagued by uneven pacing. As other reviews indicate, my response is not the majority opinion\u0097but I found this novel unconvincing and more than a little frustrating, and I don't recommend it.The first three-quarters of the book is the escapades of the husband/wife team's fantastic battles. This section starts out well\u0097the scientific look at fantasy tropes is unusual and interesting, and the various battles are fast-paced and high energy. But it has a tongue-in-cheek humor which I detest and which makes the science-fantasy too comically clich\u00e9 to be realistic; furthermore, the episodic format become repetitive and the overarching narrative of the couple's relationship is unconvincing. The final quarter of the book, by contrast, is a frenzied journey into hell\u0097one which deviates wildly from the hitherto glib fantasy elements, one which is so fast-paced that it feels like it's been plucked from a different novel. As Operation Chaos is a gathering of short stories, the episodic style and uneven pacing make sense\u0097but that explanation doesn't make these faults any more enjoyable to read.Operation Chaos has its good points\u0097the science-fantasy is promising, and hell in particular is artfully rendered and at once unique and convincing. But for a variety of reasons, the novel just didn't work for me: I found the humor grating, the love story and science-fantasy unconvincing, and I believe the uneven pacing degrades the quality of the book and makes for a weak resolution. Perhaps some of this is an issue of personal taste (in particular my sense of humor and my unease with the arbitrary fantasy elements), but still I don't recommend Operation Chaos. A different reader may enjoy it more, and the original short story format explains many of its problems, but in all I found this book more frustrating than enjoyable."}, {"userName": "***Dave Hill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4631805-dave-hill", "userReview": "(2013-05-01)I picked this as a \"read out loud in the car\" book for the family as we traveled around, consciously picking a book I loved and that was an inspiration for some of my own writing. It was enjoyed by all, so far as I could tell, though reading it aloud made me conscious of (a) some interestingly epic prose styles that Anderson used, and (b) some substantial infodump passages, which are usually interesting reviews of the historic differences in our worlds, but which still drag the action to an abrupt (and sometimes self-conscious) halt.Still enjoyed it an awful lot, though.(2011-11-29)This was one of my favorite SF/Fantasy books as a youth, and probably the first of what would be today called \"urban fantasy\" books I ever read. Consisting of four short stories with an overarching frame that informs the last one, it's a \"what if magic were real but life in these United States was mostly the same?\" kind of a tale. It's a world of pervasive magic, where it's acknowledged and used just like common technology. Thus our hero, a werewolf and former B-grade movie actor, and his true love, a Madison Avenue witch.The earliest couple of tales are the rockiest, as Anderson has problems telling a World War II story and a GI Bill College Days tale without being overly cute (and dated) with the parallels (discussing brooms and flying carpets like they were cars; mentioning the different magical features of various brands of cigarettes). But the story of their honeymoon on a haunted Mexican coast, or the final piece in which a demonic mishap leads to a confrontation with the forces of Hell, are excellent, and more than compensate.Part of the joy is the relationship between Steve and Ginny, which grows and deepens with each installment. And they serve as a great model for how you can have a strong, happy, interesting married couple as protagonists.Despite some of the initial weaknesses, this book is a lot of fun, a set of rollicking tales, and worth tracking down a copy of.

That first bit was new to me in the Anderson library -- a contemporary world where magic replaced technology, so brooms and flying carpets replaced aircraft, etc. It had demons and magic spells as a werewolf and virgin witch fought off the evil Caliphate that had invaded the good ol' U.S.That was fun and interesting, but the further stories and novelisation just took things in a very boring direction, with bitter whining about the \"dang gubberment\" and bizarre twists like \"God is real and exists but I am going to deny this because I am a whiny contrarian manchild.\" In fact, the novel is a good example of the older Anderson, who just had to write of the Glories of Libertarianism every now and then, in books that sacrifice story to demagoguery."}, {"userName": "Joris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5942766-joris", "userReview": "humor flavoured proto urban fantasy with a twist"}, {"userName": "Robert Defrank", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31223333-robert-defrank", "userReview": "Poul Anderson is swiftly becoming one of my favorite writers, perhaps even my very favorite in the sense of being the most well-rounded due to his high qualities in such a wide variety of genres.

We are introduced to Steve Matuchek and Ginny Graylock, werewolf and witch and an exceptional husband-and-wife team.In an alternate world where magic is real and is mated to tick in fantastic yet believable ways, Steve and Ginny meet and have their first mission, in an alternate version of World War II where the western powers do battle with an aggressive, jinn-powered Caliphate, they must prevent the enemy using a bottle where a jinn of apocalyptic power and destruction is imprisoned.Fortunately, Steve has his were-flash of artificial moonlight allowing him to shift at will, and Ginny is armed with arcane might of her own.

Parts of the novel were published as separate stories in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1956, 1959 and 1969 before being combined into this novel and published in 1971. It is very easy to tell while reading where the breaks between the separate stories are but knowing the history beforehand ensured that it wasn't disruptive to me even though it was definitely noticeable.I think that I randomly picked this paperback up in my local used bookstore (Farenheit 451 Books) through pure chance. My edition has a classic 60s/70s fantasy image of the two main characters where the female witch is scantily clad; surprisingly the face was not that well done in the painting. The tag line on the front cover is \"They searched a universe of parallel worlds to find the Earth where science and Magic meet\" and I don't know why science isn't capitalized. In any case I found that description to be completely off-base. That isn't a bad thing as I found the book more interesting than the tag line.The first section does a good job of introducing a setting where Magic is ubiquitous and there is apparently no science more advanced than submachine guns. Travel is via broomstick or flying carpet instead of automobile or airplane. Lycanthropy is not uncommon and has military applications.I have been on a kick lately of reading older SF/F and really enjoy how books can convey the time at which they are written. This book doesn't have anything as obvious as overt racism but it definitely does have a 50s stereotype of a woman's expected role in life. This is expressed by the female lead going against type be being a strong character with a military background.This book is Urban Fantasy in my opinion, even if much of it isn't set in a city. This was published at least a decade before this genre was named as such but I still think it os a good fit.I enjoyed the character progression of Steve and Ginny throughout the book even if it was a bit disjointed (as mentioned earlier). I acn only imagine that it could have been even better had the novel been written as a single work.The pseudoscience and mathematics in the final story was pretty interesting, this one felt like the longest story in the book. I found that the climactic scene had a deus ex machina resolution which was quite unsatisfying. That is the biggest complaint I have in an otherwise good book. This was the first Poul Anderson book, I will have to keep my eyes open for pthers to add to my growing collection of older SF/F paperback collection."}, {"userName": "Morgan Alreth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14832688-morgan-alreth", "userReview": "The blurb on Goodreads doesn't even give a good introduction to the book, much less give a clear picture of what to expect. Yes, the hero and heroine are a werewolf and a witch. Yes, magic and technology work together. Yes, they meet each other on an assignment to neutralize a demon. All of that is covered in the first, maybe the first couple of chapters. After that, it starts to get interesting. Poul Anderson's greatest strength, in my opinion, has always been world building. An expert graphic artist can take a pencil and, with a few deft strokes, produce a window into another world. Poul Anderson takes a few deft words and produces a window into another universe. He did it with his Terran Empire universe, and he did it here. (By the way, this is not a prequel. This is the original. Operation Luna is the sequel. There is another sequel where their adult daughter, Valeria is the heroine. The name escapes me at the moment, but it's a good book too.)The span of this story covers decades in the life of this couple, and their ongoing war against the forces of hell itself. All of it is set against the backdrop of a world that is facing the same kind of social and cultural stresses that we are. But this world is dealing with direct intervention from satanic agents who are manipulating both government and church with the intent of bringing about humanity's destruction. Steve and Virginia are only two of the soldiers for light, but they are the ones we cheer for. The entire book is told in First Person POV through Steve's eyes.

Looking at the title page told me that the first story was written in 1959, and the last one in 1969. Don't know if Anderson wrote connecting pages or not.The setting is a world with magical powers and were creatures, witches, etc. The protagonist, Steve Matucek is a werewolf, able to change into wolf form pretty much at will. The first mission he is teamed with Virginia. America is under attack, and the enemies have gotten a monster (oops, forgot the exact name) and if this gets loose it will reek havoc and turn the tide against us. Virginia with her witch powers, and Steve with his wolf powers get behind enemy lines and subdue the monster. After that the war is over, Steve is released from the army, decides to go back to college rather than back to his acting career. He is kind of smitten with Virginia, too. A college prank goes haywire and it's up to Steve to fix it. In the third story they face off against a demon they encounter on their honeymoon. The last story has a struggle as a new religion is gaining more and more power.Maybe I didn't have enough attention to focus on the book, or my imagination is just not up to snuff, but there was a whole section about an alternate universe with non-euclidian laws which was hard to follow. There were also a lot of new ideas brought together really fast -- in short story fashion. The book was OK, I think I enjoyed the third story the most. There are a lot of great books out there that are more worthy of being read."}, {"userName": "Jeff Greason", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49062685-jeff-greason", "userReview": "I've greatly enjoyed almost everything by Poul Anderson. This is as close to Anderson channeling Heinlein -- but the Heinlein of Magic Inc and Jonathan Hoag -- as anything else. Creative parallel world story, but for once, not quite enough of the worldbuilding work is shown. I have the definite sense that Anderson knew what made his fictional world divergent from ours, but never felt the need for some exposition that brought the reader along. So it didn't feel quite as well grounded as, for example, the alternate world of Lord Darcy or Kalvan of Otherwhen.Still, the characters are interesting and so is the story. I particularly like the handling of lycanthropy and the \"alternate world war two\" setting; and there is quite a bit of social commentary in there, which while in its time might have seemed subtle, today, when trends have continued, is rather stinging. That's a recommendation, not a complaint, as the trends are well worth highlighting. It is not at all didactic, but woven in to the story during the period somewhat corresponding to our 1950's and 1960's -- you'll notice it if you look.I don't think it is one of Anderson's strongest works -- but that's a high bar, indeed, and if you like magical works with a SF flavor, or alternate-worlds stories, you'll likely enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Andy Love", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8171548-andy-love", "userReview": "Back in the 1940s and 1950s it seemed like every major SF author wrote a \"magic as science\" story; this one is probably my favorite. It's made up of four short stories, the first of which introduces Steve and Virginia, a werewolf and witch, fighting for the US in an analog of the Second World War (which in this world, the US is fighting against the Caliphate, which successfully invades the western US). Magical technology, made possible by technological developments in the 19th century which allowed for cold iron (legendarily antagonist to magic) to be neutralized, is the basis for technology in this world, and after the war, Steve and Virginia fall in love and marry, leading to the longest part of the novel, in which they must enter hell. Anderson puts in a lot of cute touches (after the war, Steven works briefly in the movies for Metro-Goldwyn-Merlin for example), and ends the novel with what I realized years later was a Tom Lehrer reference. The last portion of the novel takes place during the counterculture era and was written then, which makes some aspects of that section of the book pretty dated, but throughout the book, Anderson keeps the story moving with great verve, making me smile throughout."}, {"userName": "Mark R.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47081-mark-r", "userReview": "Having never read anything by Poul Anderson ...

Everything is slightly different, and cute little references to normal human objects and inventions are given magical twists. It's all done cheekily and obviously that every one of these references stuck out from the rest of the narration in a most un-amusing manner.Lead character is a werewolf; much of the story concerns his loving relationship with his supernatural wife, and their ongoing battles with enemies of the ...

I originally read Operation Chaos in my early teens, probably close to five decades ago, and loved it. In my opinion, this novel is one of the first \"urban\" fantasies, transplanting magic into a recognizably modern setting rather than having the story unfold in a rural utopia or distopia where robed wizard, stoic elves, and other fantasy races and beasts are commonplace. Operation Chaos takes place in a version of America in the mid-20th century, and magic is practiced as a science and used by almost everyone as an everyday tool. As a kid, I adored the whole thing. As a more than middle-aged adult, I can still appreciate the \"ripping yarn\" aspect of the story, while recognizing that there are some really dated attitudes and aspects of the book which, unfortunately, I couldn't help but notice.
