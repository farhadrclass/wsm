The story rolled along nicely and the description of the area made it seem so real. A touching experience on one page while the next may hold danger or worse...James Francis is willed an old colonial, with which he wants to fix-it-up-a-bit then dump it on some poor unsuspecting soul. Plans can change at the drop of a hat, especially when you pull an old chest out of a leach pit and discover that it contains something completely opposite of treasure."}, {"userName": "Michael Quarles", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16251282-michael-quarles", "userReview": "Surprisingly well written book by a \"new\" author. He shows a talent reminiscent of big name writers from the classic era of SF/Horror. The book has that rare ability to make you laugh one moment, and feel creepy the next. Add to that the strangest romantic angle you could ask for, and \"Malena's Kiss\" is a winner."}, {"userName": "Lynda Dickson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7863634-lynda-dickson", "userReview": "Jim Francis inherits an old house from his aunt. He later discovers this house has a checkered history and has been built on an old Indian burial ground. During renovations designed to prepare the house for sale, Jim finds a ancient chest in the septic tank. Upon opening it, Jim discovers a mysterious young woman with violet eyes, and a Celtic cross bearing the inscription, \"To my Malena, with love.\" But what happens when this beautiful woman kisses you?The author has a great writing style which flows easily and keeps you reading. This story is spooky, atmospheric, and humorous. However, at times I wasn't sure if it was meant to be funny, and some of the scenes are quite absurd, drawing on references from \"West Side Story\". In addition, I didn't find the conclusion to be very satisfying.There were numerous editing errors, mainly involving the incorrect use of words, apostrophes, capital letters, commas, and italics.Warnings: Coarse language, sexual references, drug references, violence.I received this book for the purposes of providing an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kelli", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1552791-kelli", "userReview": "I received this book for free from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review.James Francis inherits a house when his aunt passes away. It is in need of a lot of work and so he begins renovations with plans to sell it when he was finished at the end of the summer. He uncovers and old leach pit in the backyard and an interesting but horribly smelly old iron box which he opens with thoughts of some sort of \"real\" inheritance.Instead he unleashes the body of a young Venezuelan girl who had died over forty years earlier while under the tutelage of his aunt's second husband.The imagery in this book is acutely, graphically vivid. I felt like I was really there beside James Francis throughout the entire story. With the combination of old Native American burial grounds, poisoned and presumed evil ground, and ancient, evil Celtic magic, the story carefully weaved by author Paul DiPersio will keep you up late into the night equally afraid of and compelled to turn the next page."}, {"userName": "Samantha McAfee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10294494-samantha-mcafee", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book from the author for an honest review.This started a bit slow, admittedly, but once the action got going I found this to be a rather likeable book overall. The main character came across to me as more of a victim of circumstances beyond her control than anything else and made her more sympathetic than evil. Even as he was planning to exorcise her, you could feel Jim caring for her despite himself. Those moments when who Malena really was shone through the evil made it a poignant moment when she finally died in his arms. Very good story overall, though I didn't really get a strong \"horror\" vibe from it."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Molinari", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26918378-elizabeth-molinari", "userReview": "Very creative. Kept my attention.Very creative. Kept my attention.This book is a great short read that kept my attention the whole way through. it is definitely worth it to read this book. it truly sheds a light on tragedy and love. the eerie dark setting and mysterious characters really left me feeling kind of creeped out even after reading the story. I would recommend this book for someone looking for a quick read who likes love stories and dark thrillers."}], "description": "James Francis just inherited a house from his crazy Aunt Margaret; a towering, dilapidated, 18th century New England Colonial \u2026 in some creepy backwoods town called Cutler Hollow.Deep in the belly of an old backyard leach pit he uncovers a rusty iron chest, sealed with a lock, bound in chains, and inscribed with bizarre Celtic symbols.He raises the chest with dreams of gold coins, precious jewels, and sterling silverware.
