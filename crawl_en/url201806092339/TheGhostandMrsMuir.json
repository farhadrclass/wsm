While browsing library shelves this week, what should that young girl, turned older lady, come across but the book from which that lovely movie sprang. Couldn\u2019t resist. It is a lovely little book, more a novella than a novel. It was exactly the break I needed, having just read several mammoth and weighty books. It was serendipity and oddly enough, I could spot every point at which the movie differed from the book (and I last saw that movie over 35 years ago). At moments like these I wish I had the ability to stream movies so that I could run out somewhere and find this one. Still, the sweetness of the book, coupled with the memories that keep playing in my mind, are entirely sufficient to make this a very pleasant interlude. Off I go to the next book that must be read...but, I do thank the spirits of the library for plopping this one, unsought, into my hands."}, {"userName": "Darla", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953092-darla", "userReview": "Beautiful, sad, romantic story. Less than 200 pages, a really quick read. In this case, I thought the movie (1947, and one of my favorites) did a really great job representing the original story. The only thing that was really different is that Lucy had a second child in the book, while in the movie she had only a daughter. My guess is that in the movie, it was too much to try to fit in the plotline an explanation of her relationship with her son; it was interesting to read it here. Side note: the edition (1945) I got from the library was a first edition, and the title page said, \"This book has been designed in a Victory Format. Smaller type and margins produce fewer pages which permit a vital saving of paper and labor in the manufacture of a Wartime book.\"--I love brushes with history like this!"}, {"userName": "Sally906", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4949011-sally906", "userReview": "What a wonderful, sweet and beautifully sad romance. A romance that isn't a romance but really is. I loved it. I saw the old black and white movie years ago - and lapped up the tv series - but this source of those two visual medias is far better. It is the story of a widow who wants to break out of the family restraints and live life her way. She buys a house near the sea and meets it's invisible resident - the ghost of Captain Daniel Gregg. The Captain helps Lucy Muir to live the life she wants - empowers her to say no - and is there every step of the way. Interfering in-laws, a pompous son, a flamboyant daughter and even a love affair are all handled efficiently with the help of the Captain. Thoroughly recommended."}, {"userName": "Julie  Durnell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4566472-julie-durnell", "userReview": "A perfectly delightful story seasoned with Captain Gregg's salty language-just as good as the movie and perhaps even better!"}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4280724-claire", "userReview": "Goosebumps at the end.

I was skeptical because of the many tepid reviews. I adored the movie; and thought it would provide me further insight to the characters I loved so much in the film. If you like the film I highly suggest you read this book. There are differences; for example Mrs. Lucy Muir has a son in the book, Cyril. However I can see why the film adaptation didn't include him in the story. This is a short book. It's one of those easy, short, lovely books that you can read in a weekend. It's also the kind of book that takes you through someone's life in a very straightforward and clear way. I'm surprised by how attached and sympathetic I feel to the main character, Lucy. For a 143 page book, that is. Another thing that surprised me in a good way was the ending. Don't worry I won't spoil anything. I just have to confess I shed tears at the end. I was so happy. I really adored the ending and I thought the novel made some great points about life. The ghost aspect was interesting too. I liked how there were remarks about the afterlife that Captain Gregg made, yet left a lot to imagination. In a way, it was very plausible. It was less a book about a haunted cottage-- and more a book about a woman and how she carved her way in life after the death of her husband, Edwin. Again, if you are considering reading this book I say-- read it!! It's a great read. You'll definitely want to see the movie again after. Whoever says movie adaptations never live up to the books they were created by are wrong in this case."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6043535-sandy", "userReview": "If you were to ask me to name my top two or three favorite fantasy novels, the answer would take me a long time to come up with, given the overwhelming number of possible choices. But if you wanted to know my top two or three fantasy films, well, I could give you that reply fairly quickly. One of them would of course be \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), which I steadfastly maintain must be viewed on the big screen. Next up, for me, is \"The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T\" (1953), co-created by Dr. Seuss himself. And third, a film that has been charming me (and millions of others) for decades now, 1947's \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.\" The only one of these three to be shot completely in B&W, the film provided one of my very favorite actresses, Gene Tierney, with one of her greatest roles (Laura Hunt in 1944's \"Laura\" and Ellen Berent in 1945's color noir \"Leave Her to Heaven\" being her two greatest, natch), and she was perfectly matched by Rex Harrison's gruff but likeable portrayal. Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz helmed his film with great sensitivity, while composer Bernard Herrmann provided a lush and haunting score, years before his many collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock.But while this film has been a favorite of many for almost 70 years now, few, I have a feeling, have read the picture\u2019s source novel, \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,\" released in 1945 and written by R.A. Dick (the pseudonym for Irish authoress Josephine Aimee Campbell Leslie, who passed away in 1979). Now, however, thanks to Doubleday's Vintage Movie Classics series (\"novels that inspired great films\"), a new generation will finally be able to read this long-out-of-print wonder. And as it turns out, Dick's original is every bit as good as its film, with some significant differences.In the book, the reader makes the acquaintance of Mrs. Lucy Muir, a 34-year-old (Tierney was 27 when she did the picture), recently widowed mother of two in the England of the early 20th century. Fed up with the stifling attentions of her in-laws, she boldly takes her son and daughter to the coastal town of Whitecliff, where she rents the abode known as Gull Cottage. Lucy soon realizes that the house is haunted by the ghost of its previous owner, the 12-years-dead sea captain Daniel Gregg, with whom she strikes up a reasonably friendly relationship. The captain tells Lucy where he has hidden some gold, allowing her to purchase the cottage outright, and he suffers her to stay on his property with the provision that she will one day bequeath the house to be used as a rest home for retired sailors. As the years pass, the captain helps Lucy in many aspects of her life, giving brusque but sage counsel regarding her snoopy in-laws, her children, and her financial affairs. When Lucy unwittingly has a love fling with a married man, the captain comes to her aid; when Lucy is close to running out of money, he dictates his memoirs to her, which autobiography brings in decades of royalties. The reader senses that the aging widow and the deceased sea captain might have made a perfect couple, despite their bickering, if only...you know, one of them wasn't noncorporeal, and all....Excellent as the film version is, Dick's book is just as charming, and possibly even more wise, along with those aforementioned differences. (Screenwriter Philip Dunne did a marvelous job at adapting the source novel, and the changes that he made don't really detract from the film's fine qualities.) The two main differences between book and film are that Lucy's son, Cyril, does not appear at all in the picture, not to mention all the subplots pertaining to him--although daughter Anna, played in the film by 9-year-old Natalie Wood, does--and the entire section dealing with that married cad, Miles Fairley Blane (portrayed by the great George Sanders in the film), takes place in an entirely different context. We get to know a lot more about Lucy's and the captain's past in the book, making for more well-rounded characters, too. Gene and Rex, as it turns out, were indeed perfectly cast, although Tierney, who was 5' 7\", was surely a taller woman than the diminutive Mrs. Muir, as described by the author. Still, the film does basically hew to the novel fairly faithfully, up to and including that truly lovely finale in the afterlife.And speaking of afterlife, Dick's novel does give us a sneak peek as to what the great beyond will be like, but for the most part, Capt. Gregg says he just doesn't have adequate words (reasonably enough, I suppose), although he surely does dispense words of wisdom aplenty throughout \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.\" I mentioned that her work is very wise in places, and just take a look at some of the more touching samples, many of them from the mouth of Capt. Gregg himself: \"Real love isn't blind, it sees everything and has an endless capacity for forgiving....\"; \"[children's growing up] means a breaking away...and you wouldn't want them to stay anchored for the rest of their existence, growing barnacles all over them and rotting away with rust....\"; \"\u2026if you set your ship on a certain course you stick to it; you'd never get anywhere if you navigated backwards half the time....\"; \"\u2026good and bad doesn't always mean spiritual and unspiritual....\"; \"knowledge and book learning are not wisdom....\"; \"loneliness [is] not a matter of solitude but of the spirit and often much greater in company for that very reason....\"And on and on. The entire book is like that, full of sage and wonderful commentary. Dick, as it turns out, is a lovely writer, with a winning way with her descriptions of nature and a sure hand at amusing dialogue. For me, her book was absolutely unputdownable. \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" is the sort of book that you wish would go on indefinitely, but sadly, is one that clocks in at under 200 pages. Still, the evenings that I spent with it were very pleasant ones, indeed.I suppose the bottom line is that if you are a fan of the 1947 film (and I cannot imagine any viewer who would not fall in love with it), then you will surely appreciate the added depth and character background provided by Dick's source novel. The new Doubleday edition, incidentally, arrives with an introduction by novelist Adriana Trigiani, who tells us how addicted she was to the film while she was pregnant, and how she loved the fact that Capt. Gregg refers to Lucy throughout the film as \"Lucia,\" which was Trigiani's grandmother\u2019s name. (Indeed, she seems to have written a 2003 novel entitled \"Lucia, Lucia.\") Her enthusiastic intro (marred only by her saying that Capt. Gregg had died in a house fire, instead of by accidentally gassing himself to death) makes this new edition of a long-unavailable classic even more worthwhile.And I have just noticed that other titles in this inspired series include Davis Grubb's \"The Night of the Hunter\" and William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson's \"Logan's Run\"! I might have to pounce on those, too, before they disappear again for decades, although I doubt if either of them will be half as charming as \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.\" Oh, dear me, I called the book \"charming\" yet again. And as Capt. Gregg once said, \"it's a sign of old age creeping on when you make the same remark twice in as many minutes....\"(By the way, this review originally appeared on the FanLit website at http://www.fantasyliterature.com/ ... a most excellent destination for all fans of vintage fantasy fare....)"}, {"userName": "Gina Dalfonzo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5107430-gina-dalfonzo", "userReview": "Having seen and enjoyed the movie version several times, I was delighted to run across the book! It's beautifully written and a pleasure to read. And while I'd willingly watch Rex Harrison any day of the week and twice on Sundays, I have to say that the role of the captain is better written in the book. His character is more well-rounded and, I might even say, has a more moral point of view. For instance, he insists that Lucy apologize to Martha for her sharp words near the end of the story (\"You can't leave her like that -- weren't you taught as a child never to let the sun go down on your wrath . . . ?\"), which is something I would have liked to see in the movie.

His wisdom and counsel along with prompt action rescue her from several scrapes. To escape penury, she \"ghostwrites\" [wordplay intentional :)] his memoirs Blood and Swash which become a bestseller.

Until a few days ago, however -while re-watching the film with my 10-year-old daughter- I'd never noticed it was based upon an actual novel. (written by a woman, Josephine Leslie behind the masculine nom de plume of R.A. Dick) At 10, I suppose the salty sea captain haunting a house without about being a malicious figure was charming to me, and, I suppose, my ten-year-old self never forgot that when she reaches the end of her life, he comes back for her. At 50, though, the idea that a very feminine woman -Lucy Muir- wants to stand on her own feet and is not only emotionally supported but actually helped to achieve her desire by a such an overtly masculine male figure -Captain Gregg- is even more meaningful to me. At my age, I see so much of how fluid gender has become (with some predictable resulting confusion) that when an archetypal ideal -where men can be men and women can be women without having to apologize too much for it- AND be truly helpful to one another in such a complementary state, well, it's very touching. If you're old-fashioned, if you would enjoy a classic romance where men aren't brutalizing and objectifying women and women aren't manipulating and emotionally torturing men, and they bring their strengths together and are transformed in the best of ways by their interaction, this is worth picking up. The dialogue, particularly between Lucy and Captain Gregg is quite sharp, good and if the movie left you wanting more of those exchanges, the book happily provides them. There is one slight difference worth noting: In the book, Lucy doesn't see Daniel, she only hears him intruding upon her thoughts so the big screen adaptation did very well to give us Rex Harrison in his turtleneck and his \"keep your distance, madam...,\"speech when Lucy sees him and approaches him in the kitchen. Also, for writing minds, one has to wonder -since the book was published in 1945 and the author was nearly 50, herself, how much the war and the great loss of life and love influenced this idea of a paranormal romance, so to speak. Anyway, I loved the movie and I'm loving the book!"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3919132-linda", "userReview": "Closer to 3.5 stars.Isn't it funny when you have watched a movie and more than once, only to find out it was a book written long ago? Of course, the movie was made decades ago but it never occurred to me that it was a book first.I first saw THE GHOST AND MRS MUIR in black and white when I was a teenager and fell in love with the ghostly charm of Captain Gregg, the sweet Mrs. Muir and, of course, the awesome music. Years went by and I saw it again late one night as an adult. I still thought it was wonderful but this time I appreciated the costumes and, if I didn't know better, the winds and smell of the sea. I rarely buy movies but this was one time I searched for the dvd and acquired it. It was made in 1947 and, whether you rent it on Netflix or buy it, try to watch the black and white version with Rex Harrison and Gene Tierney. Not the TV show. The movie is oh, so, good!But back to the book. I tagged it 'coming of age' because even though Lucy 'Lucia' Muir is in her early 30's and a widow with young children, she has quite a bit of growing up to do. Under the thumb of her sisters-in-law, she is bursting to finally be on her own and Gull Cottage calls to her. Captain Gregg, the original owner, unexpectedly died under unusual circumstances. Not meaning to, the home was left to his good-for-nothing nephew. So he haunts it. And since then, no one has lived there for more than a few hours. Until Lucy 'comes home'.I enjoyed reading how the two originally met. Lucy is earthier in the story and prone to make mistakes. There were even a couple of times I didn't like the decisions she might have made if the Captain didn't get involved. In the book Lucy hears his voice but never actually sees his spirit as in the movie. There are other differences and, as someone else said, it was probably to make the movie flow smoothly. Though I did like the story, if I had to choose between the two I would pick the movie, hands down. This is a fantasy-ghost story-historical romance and slice of life taking place in England-by-the-sea during the early 1900's. It has some 'woooooo' moments but they are light. Read it, watch it or do both and see which one you favor.

Her search leads her to purchase the former house of Captain Daniel Gregg, who stills haunts its halls (which Lucy is fully aware of when she decides to live there...interesting). Even with her new move, Lucy's quest for independence (of thought and action) is not without challenge from former and new influences in her life.Imediately, I felt that Lucy Muir was so much more than what most who knew and met her supposed she was--\"poor little Mrs. Muir\", the demure, timid little creature that everyone must take care of and tell what to do, for her own good of course. (I got the impression that she's just introverted, but is mistakened for being shy, which helped me connect to her that much more. She'll politely listen to and consider your advice and enjoy your company for a while, but prefers to make her final decisions and spend most of her time alone.) I'm sure the woman they \"knew\" her to be would not have willingly moved into a house haunted by a salty old sea captain, speaking to him and seeking his advice regularly. (Neither would she have gotten involved with anyone like Miles.) And so she was, so much more. And I really loved the spice the captain brought out in her.I loved both Mrs. Muir and the ghost of Captain Gregg, flaws and all. (I couldn't help picturing them as Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison.) Though, at one point, I got really angry and disappointed concerning her behavior with Miles (and how she took out her feelings on others). But I suppose that that was all part of the growing up she had to do. I laughed every time the captain intervened, and at the candid, though often rude remarks, he made about and toward different characters in the book. I truly appreciated the wisdom that Leslie (that's Josephine Aimee Campbell Leslie who penned this book under the pseudonym R. A. Dick) poured through (Professor Higgins..., I mean,) the captain.The ending was sad in some ways and happy in others (when you consider the whole of her life and her descendants), and yet always anticipated (at least, I expected it). Leslie's prose seemed to appropriately depict an aging mind, which, I thought, is very powerful in its impact on the reader.A very interesting, very entertaining book.

I LOVED this book. It's charming and old-fashioned; having been written in the 1940s, it evokes a time long gone. While I haven't seen the film version (which I am looking forward to), I did grow up watching the TV show...and loved it.Of course, the book is much richer than anything we watched on TV in those days, but the story of a ghost of a sea captain haunting his earthly home now inhabited by a widow is essentially the same. Essentially. The widow's life, though, continues through many years and she watches her children (she has two) grow up and have lives of their own. During her time in the house by the sea, Mrs Muir and the captain are friends, certainly, and she enjoys her solitude and the secret she keeps so far as her ghostly companion is concerned. The writing is clear and clean, and every so often there is a turn of phrase that commands attention. And, by the end, I'll admit it...I cried.So, if a sweet and gentle book is what you're after, this is a prime candidate."}, {"userName": "Deborah Sheldon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2705689-deborah-sheldon", "userReview": "'Oh, Lucia,' the captain said softly, 'you are so little and so lovely. How I would have liked to have taken you to Norway and shown you the fiords in the midnight sun, and to China - what you have missed, Lucia, by being born too late to travel the Seven Seas with me! And what I've missed, too.' Yes, this book is sentimental, a little cheesy and outdated, but these elements make up part of its charm. The 1947 film starring Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison made me cry, and so did this book. *sob*"}, {"userName": "Dee-Ann", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3114642-dee-ann", "userReview": "Very enjoyable. A romance story with a difference ... in which the real romance is subtle. I loved the ghost and would like to have seen/heard more of him ... and wish that someone else could expereince him too.

Upon discovering the rumors to be true, the young widow ends up forming a special companionship with the ghost of handsome former sea captain Daniel Gregg. Through the struggles of supporting her children, seeking out romance from the wrong places, and working to publish the captain's story as a book, Blood and Swash, Lucy finds in her secret relationship with Captain Gregg a comfort and blossoming love she never could have predicted.Originally published in 1945, made into a movie in 1947, and later adapted into a television sitcom in 1968, this romantic tale explores how love can develop without boundaries, both in this life and beyond.", "title": "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239437.The_Ghost_and_Mrs__Muir", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349227436l/239437.jpg", "reviews": 247, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2645219.Josephine_Leslie", "name": "Josephine Leslie"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/140093.R_A_Dick", "name": "R.A.
