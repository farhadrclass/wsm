DuBoisEvery few years there is a book that is so powerful it turns me into a book nerd, policy evangelical. I go out and buy several copies and press them into friends hands with the fervor of a recent convert and tell them they \"NEED\" to read it. I think the last nonfiction book to do this for me was Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right or maybe The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine. Usually, the book has both a financial angle and a policy tint. It usually also explores unfairness. That makes sense. In my previous life I was a policy analyst and I now work in the finance industry as a financial planner. Most days, I'm a pretty mellow guy. I meditate, read, drink tea, Netflix and chill. But reading about inequality and unfairness, for me, catalyzes me for action.If the last few political cycles have taught us anything, it is America still struggles with its \"original sin\" of slavery and the ugly descendants of slavery: discrimination, segregation, inequality, despair. We have seen, just this week (actually for the last few years), protests about the way Black Americans are treated by police officers. That subject deserves its own space, so I wont dwell too much on that here, other than to say the interaction of Black Americans and police officers ISN'T simple. It isn't a subject that can easily be explained just by saying police are racists, or unarmed Black Americans should behave differently (different from whom?). There are structural, geographic, economic, historical, and political forces that all contribute to awful outcomes. Just like blue on black violence isn't easily explained in a tweet or a FB post, the interaction between Black Americans and banks has a long, ugly, and painful history. It is a history that is important to understand if one REALLY wants to explore topics like income inequality, segregation, credit, crony capitalism, corruption, exploitation, state power, wealth, etc... Mehrsa's book explores the policies, laws, programs, politics, economics, and history of black banks AND the history of Black Americans with banks. She points a fairly bleak picture of the fault/chasm that exists between the two financial markets that exist in America. One is the banking structure that exists for a majority of Americans and doesn't need to be explored. But for years that economic structure, that allows people to save (AND BORROW) didn't exist for a large segment of Americans. And when it eventually did, it was skewed heavily. Separate was never equal in banking. Blacks paid a heavy price to save, to borrow (if they could). Even laws that were designed to help pull Americans out of poverty, accumulate wealth and avoid taxes through home ownership, benefited one segment of America while ignoring or fleecing the other. It is a painful read. It is also necessary. Unlike Mehrsa Baradaran's* previous book, How the Other Half Banks: Exclusion, Exploitation, and the Threat to Democracy, this one spends little/less time on prescriptions. She is laser focused on what is wrong, what went wrong, and why. It is a dense (without ANY of the negative connotations typically associated with that word) book. One that required me to open THREE different post-it flag packages. I was marking things that were new, quotes that amazed, items I didn't want to forget and I often found myself marking 3 or 4 times a page.A few caveats before I end. This isn't a perfect book. It isn't as exciting as a Michael Lewis book (this probably won't get made into a movie) and the prose isn't as pretty as Robert Caro's LBJ series. But it is important. It is a labor of both love and skill. Reading some chapters in it, I could tell Mehrsa spent months in presidential libraries. Well researched books give me a thrill. Especially when you recognize that a certain nugget of data or quote may never have seen the light of day if it wasn't for the doggedness of a skilled lawyer/historian. 'The Color of Money' deserves to be in the library of anyone who deals with or seriously thinks about income inequality, race, banking, inner cities, etc. As a white, upper-middle, male who has benefited from educated parents, stability, wealth, and every advantage American history and politicians have blessed me with, it is difficult and humbling to realize just how many of the economic realities I take for granted every day weren't available to the parents of my black friends. Hopefully, more of these same financial realities WILL be available to the children of ALL my friends. Hopefully we can begin to cover both the scars of the disadvantaged, and the economic and social chasms that separate (unfairly) us. This book is both a bridge and a battle cry.* It is probably appropriate here to say that I'm friends with Mehrsa. Friends in the sense of exchanged books (I've sent her a couple audiobooks, etc. and she signed one of her books and sent it to me AFTER I reviewed it. Each of her books were purchased, often multiple copies, by me.) and know a lot of similar people and interact and went to the same college. We are not friends in the sense that she's ever fed my kids, or I've ever watched her pets. So there's that. I have other friends who are writers, but usually they are friends first. I don't typically \"read\" friends books unless I would normally read these books without being friends. Romance novels written by \"friends\" or self-help weight-loss books, I'll never read no matter how often someone feeds my kids."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4121395-andrew", "userReview": "This is an excellent history of Black banking and economics in the USA. Showing that whilst African Americans have constantly sought control of their own economic independence since emancipation, the establishment has purposely kept Black communities and entrepreneurs out of the wider economy. Whilst the author does not provide a specific solution, she highlights a pattern that despite everything, Black banking has over the past decades always managed to re-establish itself. And this might suggest positive outcomes for the future.

They can work harder and smarter and never have a chance because the system disadvantages them at every turn, this book spells out those disadvantages in agonizing and depressing detail. Everyone needs to read this book. Especially free market libertarians ugh. Favorite quote: In speaking about the collapse of subprime loans, \"This Market was not created by poor minority borrowers, but those at the bottom are most likely to be exploited by new credit innovations. Just as exploitative credit arrangements like share cropping was created by demand from the world-wide cotton market, sub-prime lending was connected to a world-wide demand for mortgage loans. That the black population was exploited in both situations speaks to their lack of wealth, political power, and their exclusion from the main channels of economic power. During reconstruction, black borrowers had no other options for credit, so they entered share cropping. A similar situation was created with contract selling when blacks were redlined out of the government loan market. Once again, during the sub-prime era, the market demanded more loans, and the black population was the most vulnerable population of borrowers, having had limited access to credit for generations. THIS PARAGRAPH!!!!!\"Without malice, capital looking for yield can lead to exploitation if there are structural inequalities. Capitalism itself cannot overcome those inequalities because capital only seeks to accumulate unto itself. Without structural changes, the urban ghetto would never be a lure for wealth building capital, only a magnet for exploitation. \"There are two banking systems in America, one is the regulated and heavily subsidised main-stream banking industry, the other is the unregulated, costly, and often predatory fringe industry.  The black population has historically been unders the latter having historically been left out of the former. This has come at great expense to their community. \""}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15548366-richard", "userReview": "A fascinating and fast-paced history of banking, with a focus on more than 150 years of targeted *economic* discrimination against black Americans. I was shocked to learn some of the on-the-record statements made by blatantly racist politicians \u2013 including many who have occupied the Oval Office. The author explains the incredible power of banking\u2019s money multiplier effect, and how this power could not be realized in ghetto \u201csavings & thrift\u201d banks that were not also lending to their local customers. This book made me realize, for the first time, how important something so seemingly mundane as FDIC deposit insurance is to the entire banking system. For decades black banks have found themselves caught in a complex double-bind (\u201cDamned if we do, damned if we don\u2019t\u201d) of needing to run profitable businesses, coupled with implicit and explicit goals of acting as community institutions \u2013 functioning like quasi non-profits \u2013 to serve high-risk, high cost-to-serve customers in under-banked ghetto neighborhoods (customers with low deposit balances AND high transaction volumes). I was hoping the last chapter was going to be, \u201cAnd this is how modern black banks cleared the hurdles that led to the demise of all their predecessors\u2026\u201d Unfortunately, that happy ending is still a future event. The author left me significantly better informed about the systematic, historical causes of the racial wealth gap and sincerely hoping that viable solutions are on the near horizon to help close that wealth gap in America.Well researched and well written. I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Eric Bybee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63181254-eric-bybee", "userReview": "This book is a stunning achievement and sets a new bar for historical narratives of racial inequality in the United States. Perhaps no other metric captures the collective impact of centuries of anti-Black prejudice and discrimination across various domains of social life (including housing, education, and voting--to name a few) like the racial wealth gap. Accordingly, it should not be surprising that this metric frequently emerges in the everywhere from the writings of Ta Nehisi Coates to the pages of the Wall Street Journal. Baradaran's central innovation is telling the story about this well-known metric in a wholly new way: through charting the history and balance sheets of Black banks. In prose that is detailed yet accessible, she shows how these institutions designed for racial uplift were fatally handicapped by the Jim Crow economies where they operated. Rather than build wealth within the Black community, the broader segregated economies made these banks function like sieves and actually drew money out of Black communities. She additionally brings to light the (largely untold) story of how the Nixon administration used the notion of \"Black Capitalism\" as a cynical ploy to avoid addressing the central issues and policy goals of the Civil Rights Movement. Baradaran doesn't offer any easy solutions, but her exhaustive research makes a compelling case that, since broad government interventions (from land grants to FHA loans) created the racial wealth gap, we will need similarly broad kinds of government intervention to end it. I highly recommend this book"}, {"userName": "Audacia Ray", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/259202-audacia-ray", "userReview": "This book is a serious achievement - a history of black banking and the role of racism in banking institutions in the US, with lots of examples of policies and businesses initiatives and the harm they\u2019ve wrought on black communities. In particular, the author documents the wily ways of racism and capitalism, and how they adapt to appropriate movements. I was especially interested in the sections about Nixon and how he appropriated the messaging of black power and packaged it into black capitalism initiatives that divided radical black organizing with the carrot of black business support structures that were actually ways to segregate and economically crush black communities. Though the book ends on a slightly upbeat note about what could be possible.

More than 150 years later, that number has barely budged. The Color of Money pursues the persistence of this racial wealth gap by focusing on the generators of wealth in the black community: black banks. Studying these institutions over time, Mehrsa Baradaran challenges the myth that black communities could ever accumulate wealth in a segregated economy. Instead, housing segregation, racism, and Jim Crow credit policies created an inescapable, but hard to detect, economic trap for black communities and their banks.The catch-22 of black banking is that the very institutions needed to help communities escape the deep poverty caused by discrimination and segregation inevitably became victims of that same poverty. Not only could black banks not \"control the black dollar\" due to the dynamics of bank depositing and lending but they drained black capital into white banks, leaving the black economy with the scraps.Baradaran challenges the long-standing notion that black banking and community self-help is the solution to the racial wealth gap. These initiatives have functioned as a potent political decoy to avoid more fundamental reforms and racial redress. Examining the fruits of past policies and the operation of banking in a segregated economy, she makes clear that only bolder, more realistic views of banking's relation to black communities will end the cycle of poverty and promote black wealth.", "title": "The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34758210-the-color-of-money", "average": 4.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498808246l/34758210.jpg", "reviews": 23, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13832592.Mehrsa_Baradaran", "name": "Mehrsa Baradaran"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Race", "Economics", "North American Hi...", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34758210-the-color-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36354866-the-color-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25366656-how-the-other-half-banks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
