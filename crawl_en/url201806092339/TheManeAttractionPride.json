A hit woman is gunning for Mitch and he runs into the woods where the evil witch lives ( They don't really tell us what kind of witch or if she is in fact a witch or just a crazy shifter that kills people, it just kinda hints, no real details) to get away from the gun woman. The evil witch kills the gun woman within a few seconds, and is going to take Mitch kill him and use his body. (for God knows what because details in this paranormal world are always lacking) She freezes him in place so he can't move ( I guess by magic again guessing since no real details). Enter Sissy! The witch laughs and tells her she better leave unless Sissy wants to see the bad things she is gonna do to Mitch and there is nothing Sissy can do to stop her because she has him frozen in place. For some reason (not giving to the readers) Sissy can't be frozen in place. So how does Sissy defeat the evil witch that has frozen her man and plans to do unknown bad things to him. She backs up a few steps and rubs her head on his neck and wham that some how breaks evil witch woman's spell and he can move. Yay! And the witch is so mad that Sissy has foiled her evil plans that she just tells them to leave and don't come back cause they're are not welcome any longer.

You know, gorgeous and mostly lazy, happy to go all night and have someone else take care of the details...alot like lions in the wild. He's also a cop with a target on his back. The mobster he, and only he, can finger for murder is looking to get rid of the only witness. That would be Mitch. It's enough to put a lion off his feed! But it could be worse...now he's got Sissy Mae taking care of him and watching his back. If only he could stop staring at his 'buddy's butt.Sissy Mae is a born troublemaker. She's also got a streak of loyalty a mile wide, so when her 'buddy' Mitch is wounded in a murder attempt, she decides to take him home...to her home, and to hell with what anybody else thinks.

I was trepidatious about this story because of my dislike for Sissy Mae. I was right! Sissy Mae still did not move me. Of course the author remains funny and the story moves smoothly. However, I did not like that Sissy Mae and Mitch remained friends for most of the book. By time they both were willing to explore their mutual attraction, I didn't really care and I was wondering where was the sparks. I also felt that the chase of the bad guys hunting Mitch down was pushed in the background. Sure there was some action and you knew he was hiding out, but they were playing and moving around entirely too much for someone who had to be keeping a low profile.

Jessie gets her own back and then some in the previous book and she and Bobby Ray have a big ol' mammoth shindig of a wedding to end that book.This book starts right up where the previous book left off. Bobby Rae and Jessie's wedding is in full swing. Since Shifters don't normally formally marry, and Jessie is so super-rich that she rented out a friggin' castle for the wedding, almost the entire shifter community all over the US and even some parts of Europe & Asia show up. Sissy Mae is having a good time. Like her brother she is just a good ol' gal who likes to yukk it up with her cousin Ronnie Lee and her other best pal, a Lion shifter, Mitch Shaw. But Mitch is very nervous. He has just found out that there is a two million dollar price on his head to keep him from testifying at the murder trial of a Philadelphia mob boss with a long reach.After a failed assassination attempt, the wolf and lions, who are close knit friends, decide to hide Mitch away in Smithville, the small Tennessee town run by the powerful Smith clan, the family of Sissy and Bobby Ray. Since ti was all Sissy's idea, she goes along to keep Mitch company and to help keep him safe.While they are awaiting the trial, the two friends become lovers and they learn a lot about themselves and each other.This book was a hoot and a half. First Sissy Mae and Mitch were both so wisecracking and over the top, that their relationship was just pure fun to watch unfold. And now that I think of it, 'over the top' is how I can describe a lot of this book, but it was so darned funny (and touching) that you really can't begrudge all the eye-rolling you'll end up doing. First, the whole good ol' boy, southern hillbilly thing with the whole Smith clan is the epitome of over the top: The Nascar on meth drag racing, the fact that everybody's middle name is either Ray, Mae or Lee (and everybody is called by their first and middle name), the syrupy voiced 'Darlin' and 'Sugar' that peppers everybody's speech -- yeah, over the top. But the story is wonderful, the love scenes --again with Laurenston -- are scorching, and the chemistry between the two leads is off the charts.I especially loved the first two chapters that describe how awesomely insane Jessie and Bobby Ray's wedding was. Seriously, just the descriptions of how the wild dog shifters jumped onto the dance floor with glee when Parliament Funkadelic's Atomic Dog came on (and the Lions' exasperation that the dogs simply have no dignity) had me rolling. And I love the fact that SL keeps her character traits, both of the individual characters and their shifter animals, so distinct and clearly defined. And it is fun learning more backstory about her world. I was especially intrigued to know that the shifters have special units in both the police and all the military arms and to meet Sissy Mae's incredibly scary black ops cousin, Dee-Ann. But I mostly loved learning more about Sissy Mae. In the previous book she wasn't very sympathetic because you know she tormented Jessie, and it was great when Jessie kicks her ass. But you knew Sissy wasn't all bad because she takes the ass-kicking with good cheer even when her friends tease her about it mercilessly 'Isn't that the little gal who slapped you around like a dime-store hooker, Sissy Mae?'.In this book, we get a deeper look at Sissy and whence comes her chin-out bravado. We see how her relationships with her larger than life mother and her other brothers have shaped her. She becomes less of a one dimensional character and completely wins me over. And Mitch is a delight. Sissy is the Alpha in their relationship and he is just fine with it as long as he stays fed and can tumble her on the nearest surface when he feels the urge.I am having such a good time hanging out with the various characters in these books, I am gonna be severely bummed when I've finished all the books."}, {"userName": "Francesca the Fierce (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3108364-francesca-the-fierce-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "2011 Re-ReadThis review was posted at Under The CoversIf there is a reason why you haven't picked up the Pride books yet, you have to put everything else aside and get them! If you didn't know about them, then let me introduce you to the sexiest shifters around!This Pride book is all about fun! Mitch Shaw has a \"nothing-bothers-me\" playful attitude towards life, and Sissy Mae, even though crude and mean at times, is a fun chick!And Mitch is one of my favorite felines in ALL shifter series! How adorable is he? We first met him for a little bit in the second story of book 1 (Shaw's Tail). We thought he was the good-for-nothing brother of successful Brendon Shaw, turns out he was a cop who had gone undercover to expose a mobster, and was now in the witness protection program! They need him alive to testify, the criminals want him dead. And lets not forget that he IS the karaoke king among the Kuznetzov Pack, to be worshiped at their altar. *snickers*Mitch and Sissy are best buds, they've been working together at Mace & Smitty's security firm. Mitch is being his usual prankster self, and Sissy is her usual \"just-a-tad-bitchy\" she-wolf. This book begins while we are still at Jessie Ann & Smitty's wedding, and yes, Mitch and Sissy Mae are both still fighting their attraction to each other, because between good friends sex will only complicate things, and then there's the fact that Mitch knows after he testifies he will have to assume a new identity and disappear. But things take a turn for the worst when Mitch gets shot. Yes, someone is after him, wants him dead, and it just happens to be shifter. How can they protect Mitch?Sissy takes it upon herself to \"kidnap\" him, taking him where she swore she would never return. Back home to Tennessee. Nobody knows he's there. And Sissy soon finds herself full of hot naked lion, in a town full of crazy wolves, and BOY he can eat!!!Crazy, hysterical, extremely sexy and cute. This book will keep you entertained from page one, and you won't be able to put it down! Their banter had me almost in tears laughing. And some of the things that happen just... I have no words. Like when Mitch ends up wrestling with Ralph (the alligator), or when we meet cousin Dee Ann, or when they go to the grocery store because Mitch \"ate her out of her house\".And as any good, honorable lion shifter, when this bad boy gets all hot and bothered, HE CAN DELIVER!So what are you waiting for? You have to read this series! You have to read this author! It is guaranteed to get you out of any reading funk, improve your mood, and... make your insides quiver.It is so difficult to pick a favorite quote, since most of this book is full of humor, but here's my best attempt:Best description of Sissy Mae:To quote Janie Mae, \"Sissy came out of my womb with her middle finger raised.\"\"Is that why they call you Mr. Fumble Paws?\"\"Sexy, sexy,\" she growled at him before she could stop herself. \"You treat me like a whore\" \"You are a whore\" He grinned \"This is true\""}, {"userName": "Melindeeloo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2766907-melindeeloo", "userReview": "This sexy shifter pair will make you howl with laughter and purr with satisfactionWith a hefty reward offered for his death, undercover cop and lion shifter Mitch is badly wounded by a would-be assassin's bullet just days before he is to deliver the testimony that will bring down a powerful crime boss -- then he's off to witness protection. In order to keep Mitch safe from others looking to cash in, wolf shifter Sissy Mae Smith bundles up her bleeding buddy and takes Mitch to the one place where she know she can make a stand - the one place Sissy avoids when ever possible - she takes him home to Smith Town. But as Mitch recovers, Sissy Mae and Mitch start seeing each other in a whole different way and soon they are taking their relationship to the next level with lots humor and plenty of heat. I am really becoming a fan of Laurenston's shifter romances. These are a steamy and fun with all kinds of crazy family relationships, fun little side bits like the `great race' and let them eat pie scenes along with a handful of other subplots to stir into the mix. I loved both Sissy's and Mitch's uber-alpha mamas, the Aunts, and all the dynamics of the large extended southern werewolf family of Smith Town. There was so much that was fun and funny and Mitch's whole 'I am a pampered puddy cat, feed me now' lion attitude was a crack-up. The humor, the banter, and the playfulness between Mitch and insane alpha Sissy Mae also serve to build the sexual tension between the pair since Laurenston holds off on the consummation until well into the book. Along with the tension building, Laurenston continues to do a great job of managing the steamy stuff - giving us a couple of healthy doses of spicy loves scenes and then just giving us sensual snippets to keep things hot while avoiding being repetitious. After meeting bad-girl alpha Sissy in previous books, I wasn't so sure that I would be interested in seeing her as a leading lady -- she was truly evil to Jess. But I really did end up enjoying both Sissy and her story. Even though Sissy is still very alpha here, we see a surprising amount of vulnerability in her as she finally finds in Mitch the shifter who can match her appetites and challenge her `boundaries'. Can't wait for the next one. For fans of the series, there are decent cameo appearances by past leading ladies Dez, Jess and Ronnie. Which means that this book will be more fun for you if you've read the previous two in the series.

I found him, the man of my dreams, and I am hopelessly in love...This book has just made my list of favourite books of all time! The Mane Attraction is the 3rd book in the Pride series and it's all about the love of my life, Mitch Shaw. Mitch is a lion shifter who happens to be an undercover cop. While he's waiting to testify he's staying with his brother, he figures he'll be safer with other shifters. But when someone tries, and almost succeeds, to kill him Mitch is taken to the one place no one will look, Smithsville! Sissy is the alpha female of her wolf pack and a free spirit, one who likes to cause trouble. Mitch and Sissy are best friends and when Mitch is attacked Sissy takes him home to protect him. But Sissy isn't completely welcome at home and now Mitch and Sissy have more to worry about then one assassin, including losing their hearts. This book made me laugh from page one! The characters are funny and I just love their need to cause trouble and drive everyone crazy. Sissy is my hero! She is one of the greatest female characters I've ever read about, she is crazy but strong and she isn't scared of anything or anyone (well except love that is). I LOVED that Sissy and Ronnie made the boys weep from fear and starvation. They drove the men crazy and joked around with them but when it came down to life or death they were deadly serious and protected the ones they love. I really liked that Sissy was just one strong chick who managed to take on anyone who tried to take something from her.Mitch is AMAZING! He is funny and sweet and HOT and strong... What woman couldn't love him? I really enjoyed the interaction between Mitch and Brendan, in my mind that is how brothers should be. They love each other enough to kill but will tease each other until one of them gets hit in the jaw. I loved the crazy sex with Sissy and I think they are really perfect for each other! Laurenston has created a fun world with amazing characters and hysterical dialogue. I cannot wait to carry on reading this series :)"}, {"userName": "Crazy for Books (Stephanie)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2949869-crazy-for-books-stephanie", "userReview": "5 ROARING STARSThrown together because best friend and pack member Ronnie Lee and Brendon Shaw are mated, as well as staying off the radar until the trial he's to testify is ready for him Sissy Mae Smith and Mitchell Shaw have become the best of friends. At least that's what they think. Everyone else seems to know what they both don't seem to realize. And that is, they are meant to be together. They are so much alike, both deriving pleasure in torturing others as much as engaging in risky behavior, like racing a car at top speeds, or tormenting someone verbally, yet funnily, into attacking. But, early on Sissy said that they would only ever be friends and Mitch, agreed.Now that they are together in hiding in, of all places, Smithtown, because there's a hit out on Mitch which almost ended his life, they start to realized they compliment each other in all the ways that really matter. And the sex is off the charts.This was so funny. I don't think there were more than two pages I went through without throwing my head back in laughter. From Sissy's handling of her brothers, the aunts and Dee-Ann getting into Sissy's business, to Mitch getting in the face of any male near Sissy and Mitchell and Brendon tussle with Ralph. Mitch's sarcastic humor had me in stitches. I loved the banter between Mitch and Sissy.I can't wait to read the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Ciera", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20869822-ciera", "userReview": "Mitch and Sissy Mae just became one of my favorite couples in this series!! To be honest, when I read the last book I thought I would always dislike Sissy, she just didn't seem likable. This book completely changed my mind. She comes across as an extremely dominant and harsh person but around the people she cares about, she's very caring. Mitch almost has the same traits as she does which is why these two work together so well. I almost forgot I wanted these two to be a couple after so many chapters of their amazing friendship. It was down right cute the amount of witty dialogue that went on with them that I found myself grinning so many times. This is something that I loved the most in this book because of course, they were denying themselves what they really felt but neither of them pushed the other into a relationship. When they finally did the do it was amazing :)I'm so glad that I read this one because I have a new appreciation for Sissy Mae. Seeing how some of her family treats her is horrible. Her mother, although she acts loving to some, is incredibly rude to her daughter. Travis is an absolute asshole, I had to be on Sissy's side. I adore the way Laurenston writes her dialogue. The comedic tone of the books just hits every time and the couples always have off the charts chemistry."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4234612-julie", "userReview": "I have read alot of good books lately and this one did not dissapoint. I love this book more than I can say it- had everything; romance, action, great H/h and secondary characters. But what I love most was Mitch; which is odd because he annoyed me in The Mane Squeeze(which I read first and out of order). How he acts now makes sense to me and I just love him; with his sense of humor he was just perfect for Sissy. They had such great chemistry and I really liked how they were friends before they ever hooked up. I laughed out loud and smiled alot while reading and waas bummed when it was over.

Usually, I know I'll enjoy the humor and mischievous action of the characters, if nothing else. This one was just okay. It's not as good as the first two books of the Magnus Pack series or the previous book of this series, IMO. The main couple, Sissie Mae and Mitch, are better as secondary characters.

This was Sissy Smith and Mitchell Shaw. Neither of them was a favorite character of mine. Didn\u2019t matter. Even when I don\u2019t love Laurenston\u2019s characters I love her characters.

Review publishes on 10/25/2017.Every time I re-read a Pride novel, I find myself binge reading the entire series. Laurenston\u2019s shifters never get old. There\u2019s something wonderfully addictive about her story-telling. Her characters are silly, sexy, and downright adorable. I grow deeply attached to them and can\u2019t seem to let them go.Mitch O\u2019Neil first appears in \u201cShaw\u2019s Tail,\u201d the second story in THE MANE EVENT. Mitch is the half-brother of Brendon Shaw and one of his favorite hobbies is to fuck with people.Yeah. he\u2019s a real productive pal to have.It\u2019s no wonder he and Sissy Mae became fast friends when he decided to work for Smitty and Mace in their new security business while he awaits trial. What he didn\u2019t expect is to become best friends with the hottest and most mischievous she-wolf he\u2019s ever met.Mitch is one of my favorite lion shifters in the Pride series. He\u2019s oh so naughty and delicious but what I love the most of all is his ridiculous lion-sized appetite. He eats so. Much. Food. And he does not share. It\u2019s hilarious to watch he and Sissy battle it out for Oreos\u2026 Of course, most of their \u201cfights\u201d turn in to sex which is totally a bonus.He\u2019s and Sissy are made for each other. They are both insatiable trouble makers. I have to say, Sissy Mae was never my favorite character because she was a mega bitch as a kid. Yeah, I never heard a plausible excuse for her Reign of Terror, either. Thankfully, it does seem like she\u2019s grown out of picking on the weak and has channeled that aggression into protecting her pack, her family and friends, and getting herself and her BFF Ronnie Lee banned from foreign countries.All-in-all, THE MANE ATTRACTION is a nice addition to the Pride series. I had an entertaining time reading Sissy and Mitch adventures. It\u2019s a blast to watch the two get themselves into\u2014and out of\u2014all sorts of wacky situations."}, {"userName": "Carolyn F.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2624012-carolyn-f", "userReview": "I'm giving this 3 stars, which I'm surprised by. I usually love Shelly's books but this one, not a whole lot. Sissy Mae has never been a favorite character for me, she's much too mean and she even says in the book how she was horribly mean at 14 but she wouldn't take back anything she did (being the bully at school and torturing all the other kids). I don't get that. And Mitch, he's sounds cute and very lazy not caring that she's running out of money feeding him, just expecting it and it's like the book thinks this is an adorable quality. Sounds like a sponge to me and I should know, I used to date one for almost 5 years! The man needs to support himself or learn to eat cheaper things, like high fat hamburger instead of zebra as an example. He even gives Sissy money from his brother, to cover some of his expenses. You're a cop, I know you don't make a lot, but still a little ridiculous. So you take my least favorite character and put her together with a lazy, sponge equals not a good book to me. And since I'm on a complaining run, the wedding was way too long and so was the beginning where she's taking care of him. Another book that had me getting up and doing something else except reading, which doesn't happen often. I loved the mothers. I hated the race and the fast driving, boring to me. The witch in the mountain, wasn't even a little bit scared when Mitch went up there even though I was supposed to be. I'm not giving up on Shelley, I'm just hoping with these two characters over and done with the books should be much better."}, {"userName": "Mollie *scoutrmom*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2996547-mollie-scoutrmom", "userReview": "This is the funniest thing I've read since Janet Evanovich started writing Stephanie Plum books. These characters are friends, keeping sex out of their relationship because both seem to be sluts and they think their friendship is too important to muck up with that. Then they are forced into close proximity for days because of plot twists. The hilarity ensues, especially when the girlfriends get together.I'd classify the sex scenes in this book as spicy but not crossing the line into gratuitous erotica. They seem to be natural outgrowths of the action rather than resulting from attraction alone.Oh, the hero! Don't you just love a guy who can straight-faced make facetious comments about the wonderfulness of himself, his lovemaking abilities, and his enormous body parts? Mitch cracks the heroine up...and me too. He'd been teasing her about the sexy clothing she had on. She lost her high-heeled shoes. She asked him, \"Think you can manage without the shoes?\"His reply, \"I guess. But don't you think they do wonders highlighting my calves?\"He carried her up the stairs into the bedroom, and dumped her on the bed. \"Ready to partake of this level of perfection...of this true symbol of all that is good and right in men?\"Sissy Mae is a hoot in another way. I don't want to spoil it. You'll just have to read it.I gotta buy the rest of this series. At full retail, if I must."}], "description": "Weddings have the strangest effect on people. How else to explain the fact that Sissy Mae Smith woke up in Mitch Shaw's bed the morning after her brother Bobby Ray tied the knot?
