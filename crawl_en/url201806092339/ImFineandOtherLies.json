From a place of curiosity rather than arrogance.I have a theory for why we don't, at least from my own experience. Making yourself vulnerable is attractive to the world's worst people. They want \"in.\" They're like... zombies knocking on your front door, and vulnerability is removing the wooden slats and letting their hands burst in. (I'm looking at the cover of Brian Keene's The Rising as I type.) But for our own sakes, and in order not to sully our own experience of life, we should proceed that way anyway.It's so important for people, time and again, to see beyond the highlight reel of successful people, to peek at their cutting room floor. Because they probably feel like you. But they kicked ass anyway.

She is brazen about sharing the very fraught and painful experiences from her life. This was not a book about comedy or the entertainment industry or onset antics from her acting career... Whitney boldly shares some very personal, deeply arresting heartbreaking stories about her journey to find herself. I was quite disturbed by much she suffered and in the end, very appreciative of her courage and intention to share that nothing and no one is perfect. She clearly wants to debunk the assumptions we make about beautiful and famous people being different from normal people. This woman has walked through some fire... and really, haven't we all?"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10732821-amy", "userReview": "Highly enjoyed this!

There are so many neuroses discussed in this book that one is bound to see oneself somewhere. That being said, the excess of disorders that Cummings is diagnosed with - an eating disorder, a love addiction, codependency, etc. - make me wonder if there exists even one person on this planet that couldn't be diagnosed with some kind of personality disorder. It's just worrisome to think of people wandering around, hyperaware of all of their \"disorders,\" explaining ad nauseam how they are different because this is how they think versus how others think, blah, blah, blah. There is undoubtedly a benefit in self-consideration and introspection but only to a degree. If your life is seriously messed up, self-analysis is surely warranted, but the level of self-analysis Cummings delves into borders on the narcissistic, which, of course, I'm sure she'd be glad to diagnose herself with as well. The book is best when it is funny, and it often is. But it seems to be the trend right now (I'm thinking of Lena Dunham's book in particular) for funny women to explain how weird they are. Despite wondering how many issues one successful comedian can profess to have, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and laughed many times. One small complaint: Cummings loves to point out her play on words with the inclusion of \"well.\" Something like, \"When it came to my ear injury I needed to play it by, well, ear.\" It's basically like saying \"No pun intended.\" Just don't. We get it. You don't have to point it out. I know my review seems negative but I did give it four stars. Very readable and enjoyable just troublesome in an abstract, cultural commentary sort of way. Her best quotes and ideas are below.\"I was way too paralyzed by my own denial and survival mechanisms to even know what the truth was, but what I\u00a0did\u00a0know was that I was sick of being crazy because, frankly, being crazy isn't cute once you turn thirty.I'm not an addiction specialist, but smart ones have told me that alcoholism doesn't just apply to cartoon bums pounding bourbon from brown paper bags, it can be used to describe overusing anything to anesthetize discomfort: eating, drinking, fighting, cheating, gambling, worrying, shopping, or in my case, controlling.Because I have shame about it. And I learned that the engine of codependent, self-abusive, maladaptive, and addictive behaviors is exactly that. Shame. But shame can be mitigated or released in a shockingly simple way: by talking about it. The bad-ass psychiatrist Phil Stutz said something on Marc Maron's podcast that I'll never forget, which is that when we admit something shameful, it loses its power and it allows grace to enter the room.It seems the easier our lives are made by modern technology, the more people need to make up struggles for themselves.I have a completely unscientifically researched theory that humans aren't designed to look at ourselves as much as we do.\""}, {"userName": "Tony Valdez", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47501242-tony-valdez", "userReview": "Hilarious as it is heartbreaking, but ultimately optimistic.

I loved this book. It was equal parts humorous, emotional, informative, and relatable. The only reason I didn\u2019t give this a 5/5 rating was because I felt the last couple of chapters dragged on a bit too long and became a little repetitive. However\u2014 I found the vast majority of the book to be excellent and I can and will recommend it without hesitation. I expected it to be funny, but I had no idea how raw and genuine it would be. I am glad I listened to the #audiobook because there were parts where she went off script and choked back tears. I felt the sincerity and emotion in her voice when she spoke about her struggle with a severe eating disorder.

When I found out she was also a co-creator of 2 Broke Girls, I knew I liked her. I was really excited when I heard she was coming out with a book. I was hoping to laugh like I did while reading Jenny Lawson's Furiously Happy. The first chapter had me laughing and my hopes were high. Unfortunately, the majority of the book felt like background noise to me. I enjoyed the nuggets of psychology knowledge. For instance, I found myself relating to her experience with being codependent. I just felt like the book was a little all over the place and had no real structure. I wish it had followed a timeline, maybe leading up to where she is currently in her life. The book just kind of abruptly ended with a story from years ago and then the book was just over. Overall, it was okay. I liked parts but wasn't wowed."}, {"userName": "Kelly &#x1f49c;\u2615\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9050343-kelly-x1f49c", "userReview": "Wow... Whitney goes deep with this one! I wasn't sure what to expect, but this book was different than any other celebrity memoir that I've listened to. Yep, listened. Audio is the way to go with celebrity memoirs, especially when they narrate themselves. Whitney did a phenomenal job and was completely authentic in her performance.Whitney gives her life story, but breaks it into sections about her own life issues: self-help, codependence, roast jokes, sexism, egg freezing, eating disorder, boobs, headache, pit bulls and the Middle East. These all sound like random topics, but the book flows in a great way. If you like her as a comedian, you'll enjoy getting this background of her life and how she came to be. She has great ideas on beauty standards, sexism, feminism... and one of the best things is that she realizes that she doesn't know everything.Whitney ends the book so well.... \"I\u2019m gonna leave you with a quote by Jack Cornfield: 'In the end, only 3 things that matter: how much you loved, how gently you lived and how gracefully you let go of things not meant for you.

What I do know for sure: Whitney Cummings wants us to believe she is convinced of her authority in every aspect of her life. She certainly feels empowered by her personal self-discovery. And she wants us all to feel better. Just like her. After finishing the audio book two days ago, I'm still unsure how to explain her explanations for the explanations doctors and probably WebMD or the Mayo Clinic website have given her for everything that hurts in her body and her brain. I'm glad she feels like she has it mostly figured out now. But reader be cautious. Please remember this is a memoir. This is not a self-help book. She is not a therapist or authority in treatment. Although, by chapter 4, I believed she believes she is. It's mildly amusing. I laughed once or twice. Mostly I felt like she self-deprecated just enough to make it seem like she wasn't trying to come off as an authority on self-help. But *wink-wink* she really wants you to be fine after you listen to her tell you how she's fine and you can be fine, too. According to her. Based on her. But I'm me.

And since I thought she was really funny, I started looking for her stand up bits. I don't love every one of them, because some made me uncomfortable but it was okay and I watched ALL of them! So when I saw she had written a book, I had to read it. Well the book was not what I expected. She talks about her life (and what a life! I don't think I have ever known anyone who had that many problems! physically and mentally!) in a 'humourous' way! It's not funny. It didn't make me laugh, but it was not dramatic and gloomy either. I liked it because she speaks to the reader, it's like she's telling you the story and not just narrating it. So you get to know how her mind works, how she evolved over the years. She spoke about body image, trust issues, and several other topics that most people 'struggle' with and I liked her take on them.But the chapter I loved the most, is the last one. I liked her critical thinking.

She has a lot of courage and you can tell that because she talks in detail about some ugly things like her eating disorder, acne, being bitten by her own rescue dog and many more topics that you would have to torture me in order to get me to tell people about such personal matters.

I am a big fan of Whitney Cummings. I love her sense of humor and delivery and LOVED the show Whitney she used to star in. I stumbled upon this book and decided to check it out. I loved how honest she was throughout the book (despite the title). She discussed her struggles with eating disorders and her need to please. I could relate really strongly with her discussion of needing to please people more than she needed to take care of herself, and am pleased to report that (for the most part) I have found balance for this part of my personality. I think that writing this book must have been incredible difficult and hopefully cathartic as well. I have so much respect for Whitney and her personal journey and honestly found a lot of the lighter moments very fun to listen to as well. She provides good advice for not getting into crappy relationships and discusses the rape culture we live in.

And most of them are hot messes\u2014I'm looking at you Amy Schumer and Chelsea Handler.But Whitney's book made me feel both better about myself and disappointed in myself. Better because I haven't made the horrible choices she's made: the boyfriends, the eating disorder, the bad food she eats, the teen pregnancy, skipping out on hospital bills, the botched boob job. So many things. But then I feel awful because she's clearly a flawed person, yet she's rich and famous. And I'm not. But then she talks about freezing her eggs (fine) and then dedicates multiple chapters to how bad her genes are: her knee problem, her acne, her migraines, her insomnia. And that just makes no sense at all. I guess the book was supposed to be helpful. I can't say I learned anything from it because I don't have the weird problems she has. (How not to get a botched boob job, how not to get your ear bitten off by a pit bull, how not to treat your body [that one was kinda duh]. She did talk about bags under her ideas\u2014her solution photoshop. I would have liked a real solution to that. So Whitney, thanks for your honesty in your book.

Overall I enjoyed the book. Many of the sections were laugh out loud funny. She tackled several issues that I have studied and/or dealt with in my own life. She quoted some of my favorite experts as well, which somehow helps me to feel validated.Like some of the other memoir / bios I have read in the last year, I am struck again at how little we really understand of what others are facing in their lives. Whitney Cummings is another public figure about whom I had no idea what struggles she faced. I think it is a great reminder that for the most part, we don't see what is really happening in peoples lives / minds. I am encouraged again to make sure I am more careful not to judge others (positively or negatively) because I just don't know. (That doesn't mean I am always good about following that counsel -- just that I am reminded again to try to be better about it.)I would recommend the book.

I thought it would be like the typically celebrity memoir with funny or enlightening stories from their childhood and career. This was more about the mental issues that Whitney has (like co-dependence) and how she is attempting to overcome them through therapy, etc. It had too much psychology jargon for a lay person book; it was like reading a textbook, and going to therapy doesn't make you an expert.

I presume if you're reading this it means you either need more encouragement to buy it, you're very bored in an airport, or we used to date and you're trying to figure out if you should sue me or not.Here are all the stories and mistakes I've made that were way too embarrassing to tell on stage in front of an actual audience; but thanks to not-so-modern technology, you can read about them here so I don't have to risk having your judgmental eye contact crush my self-esteem. This book contains some delicious schadenfreude in which I recall such humiliating debacles as breaking my shoulder while trying to impress a guy, coming very close to spending my life in a Guatemalan prison, and having my lacerated ear sewn back on by a deaf guy after losing it in a torrid love affair. In addition to hoarding mortifying situations that'll make you feel way better about your choices, I've also accumulated a lot of knowledge from therapists, psychotherapists, and psychopaths, which can probably help you avoid making the same mistakes I've made. Think of this book as everything you'd want from the Internet all in one place, except without the constant distractions of ads, online shopping, and porn.I'm not sure what else to say to say, except that you should buy it if you want to laugh and learn how to stop being crazy.
