And, okay, the writing is pretty good. It's the central idea behind the book that I had some major problems with.Our heroine is Martha, a lost woman reeling from a breakup and needing to find a place where she is accepted. Walking on a beach one day, she encounters a group of New-Age goddess-worshipping women, and saves their accident-prone leader (her name is Isis Moongarden, if that gives you any indication of where we're going with this) from drowning. Next thing we know, Martha has become a member of the group and is preparing to go on a vision quest with them.This is very much a satirical book, and most of the satire was admittedly funny and pretty on-point - the best part was how well Prose rips apart the concept of white women paying a Native American to take them on a fake vision quest, and I almost wish that the majority of the plot was spent at the retreat. Where we venture into awkward territory, however, is when it comes to the other targets of Prose's satire. Look, hippy-dippy New Agers are a great target for satire. But Prose's main source of humor seems to stem from the fact that a group of women tried to create a peaceful and supportive environment that fell apart because they couldn't stop being catty bitches to each other for longer than five minutes. There's petty relationship drama, middle-school-level jealousies, and also there's a mother-daughter pair in the group that's just a minefield of tired jokes you hear from middle-aged male comedians at an open mic night. The mother is flighty and encourages her daughter's eating disorder, because LADIES BE DIETING, AM I RIGHT GUYS. The problem here is that the women themselves are often the target of Prose's humor, and the level to which she constantly runs them over in the service of her own cruel satire is disheartening. At least two of the women in the group have experienced sexual abuse, and several of them are gay. The fact that the cult is probably the only safe environment available to them is not acknowledged or discussed. And you can't tell me that this is all subtle brilliant satire and Prose is really supporting feminism instead of mocking it, because the book ends with two of the characters literally being rescued by a man. A man who mentions at one point that he hated Thelma and Louise, prompting one of the women to say that she didn't like it either. The whole scene just reeked of \"See, I'm not like other girls, I'm a cool girl! Bitches and their drama, hahaha!\" and it was (sing along if you know the words) PROBLEMATIC."}, {"userName": "Andrea Dowd", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1600336-andrea-dowd", "userReview": "This novel was supposed to be a satire on goddess religions/cults in contemporary New York. The women are horrible to each other and themselves (what goddess do you know who is anorexic)and the main character has serious self-awareness issues. Maybe it was to satirical for me, but I could not get beyond the bickering and actions that any goddess I can think of, would loath. She would have killed them all.Read if you can handle it."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4979983-kelly", "userReview": "Francine Prose has such a good ear for the pretentious/self-absorbed type of conversation that is so common in so many ways. I enjoyed this book for the idea of a group of Goddess-worshiping women who bring each other down and hack away at each other's psyches instead of nurturing and building each other up. Satirical, and I would only say it is funny as an afterthought, as it's almost too realistic to be funny."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9839176-laura", "userReview": "Francine Prose is an amazing writer. I know this from other books of hers that I have read.mso I picked this book up to continue the reading pleasure. However, I found her main characterbMartha to be mostly sympathetic in her insecurities, but I couldn't tolerate the ironic view of the Goddess group members. Each was a perfect parody of a \"type\" of searching feminist. And the problem with parodies is that they are not enjoyable characters with whom you want to spend a day or 2"}, {"userName": "Zoe", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1414906-zoe", "userReview": "I couldn't find Household Saints so I got this one and started reading it. Although it's a topic dear to my heart (wiccans and goddess-worshippers with all their foibles), I did not find the writing style very exciting. It reminded me a lot of Anne Tyler's \"Digging to America,\" another book which had an exciting topic but flat characters."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/211278-simon", "userReview": "Not nearly as good as \"A Changed Man\" or \"Blue Angel\". Making fun of goddess worshipers is like shooting fish in a barrel. You have to do it a bit better than this to make it worth reading. And Martha, through whose eyes we see the whole thing, is not a very richly drawn character. And the little epiphany at the end with the cactus?"}, {"userName": "Gretchen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5851315-gretchen", "userReview": "Although it starts out as a serious novel, by page 30 it has become satirical, and remains so throughout the book. A woman, Martha, just discarded by her boyfriend, comes upon a group of New Age female Goddess worshippers on a beach on Fire Island. She becomes a part of the group, though with reservations. The rest of the story reveals the human traits \u2013 compassion, cattiness, competitiveness, rebellion, anger, etc. \u2013 of the members, despite the reach for contemplative peace through worship. Martha, a 13 year old daughter (Sonoma) of one of the members, and various frictions within the group are the tools that let us see humans being humans. It\u2019s humorous and has a happy ending. It\u2019s not a book I would re-read. I felt the satirical tone needed to be revealed from the outset, and the serious thread needed to be more apparent in the satirical part of the book."}, {"userName": "Gia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11644414-gia", "userReview": "The best thing about this book is the cover. Although the storyline of witches and the main character, Martha, trying to find herself, is good. The writing though is very childish, very messy. The ending is not good, it is as if, the author, couldn't think of anything else to write and leaves you hanging. I will say that although the writing of this book is not very well thought out, Francine Prose, has written a wonderful book, 'Lovers at the Chameleon Club; Paris 1932'. I had read 'Lovers...' first, I was drawn to the cover, as I was drawn to the cover of 'Hunters...' Her book 'Lovers...' was very well written, especially how the characters all intertwine. She has definitely grown (with 'Lovers...') as a storyteller since this book, 'Hunters and Gatherers' from 1995."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2652492-kate", "userReview": "Annoying and unfunny. The main character never evolves and the secondary characters don't either. They are stuck and even jaguar visions never seem to really move them into a more mature place. An embarrassing depiction, supposed satire, this book just doesnt have anything to offer the reader. Was looking forward to a story of women outside the normal cultural realm and was very disappointed. The racist chatter regarding Native Americans was also very uncomfortable to read."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102271-cynthia", "userReview": "This is not to be confused with \"Hunting and Gathering,\" which is one of my favorite books. We also read that one for our book group. This story is a satire of new age-goddess religions. It's pretty funny, though I must say the goddess lovers are an easy target. She has fun with names: Hegwitha, Natalie Cornflower (a gardener), Titania, Sonoma, Isis and (OUR HERO:), Martha. Pretty good satire, comes off funny and not mean."}, {"userName": "Pascale", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430783-pascale", "userReview": "A laugh a page, at least. Admittedly, New Age nuts are an easy target, but one feels Prose could skewer anyone. I was disappointed by the rather abrupt ending, which suggests that the central character went on to have a perfectly happy life after her encounter with the Goddess worshippers. Was that in spite of them or because of them? Still, even if it is unclear what larger point the author wanted to make with this book, her dissection of group dynamics is spot on."}, {"userName": "Kerry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/348751-kerry", "userReview": "I'm really digging Francine Prose more and more. This is a wonderful skewering of how rife with hypocricy and and arrogant colonialism (hmmm ... is that redundant?) the whole New Age movement is ... though I guess any indigenous person knows this anyway. My beef is that her inipi description is inaccurate, but maybe that's not so bad. If the Wannabe Tribe uses this as a model, they'll suffocate themselves and that will fix that."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1122313-autumn", "userReview": "Another Francine Prose book I read at least 5 years ago that I really liked, but which a lot of people hate! I'd have to read it again to give it a full review. I remember liking the topic as I hadn't read a novel with this sort of focus, and I also appreciated the juxtaposition between the hippy-dippy goddess worshippers who supposedly are these great feminists but who treated each other like dirt and had no respect for other women.
