It is about a top exec at \"grand theft auto\" [ugh! thankfully he never once addressed the product of his company], who purposefully and thoughtfully took a sabbatical from the constant striving of top exec-ness so he could re-establish his relationship with his wife and kids. They moved to Bali for something around one year. Kids attended \"Green School\" - barefoot and artistic - and this book describes how this uptight, success monger turned to art and yoga and mountain-biking and hanging out with family and friends. It is well written. Inspirational. Not too sappy with platitudes."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11573535-ian", "userReview": "Man takes vacation. Feels need to write book.Mildly interesting. Writing is not that good though, and after the first 100 pages, not much else happens.
