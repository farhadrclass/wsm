Then some ghostly stuff happens and there is a mystery and so on. Cottam, as usual, does a splendid job in creating an interesting plot and his writing remains excellent. My biggest complaint about  An Absence of Natural Light  (though this is not the reason for a less than 5 star review per se) is that it should have been a novel. There was so much here that Cottam could have explored and drawn out that I think the novel would have been a better framework than a novella. This to me says a lot about this work since my experience tends towards thinking many novels would have been better novellas or long stories. As I think on it though, maybe my criticisms of this work are not wholly unrelated to the length of  An Absence of Natural Light . I felt that the female lead character, Rebecca, was completely two-dimensional and the relationship between her and the leading man, Tom, was flat. I couldn't particularly see any reason she liked him besides that he was handsome and sweet (and had a footballers body) and likewise, why he liked her (except she was pretty and not entirely stupid?). So, that was sort of disappointing, though Tom himself was craftily created and an interesting character -- one that I wanted to hear more about. The mystery of the haunting was also intriguing, but it could have been drawn-out so easily and in doing so I think that the whole novella would have been more compelling.That said, I quite liked  An Absence of Natural Light  and I love F. G. Cottam, so overall I was pleased and think you will be too if you are in the mood for a well-written, light(-ish) ghost story."}, {"userName": "John Wiltshire", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31591928-john-wiltshire", "userReview": "Trademark Cottam. This isn't a long book, more a novella, but it's managed to pack in a great deal. As usual, I fell for Cottam's characters within a few lines. I have to laugh, but I actually read up a little on the author recently. I wondered why he continually manages to write such great male characters--something which is incredibly rare in these increasingly feminised days. Cottam used to work for some of the best men's mags in London. Men's Fitness, for one. It comes over. His men are real--strong, capable, show authentic emotions, and are usually very fit and attractive. I knew there was a reason I liked these books! But I'm being very shallow (moi?), because Cottam can pull off the exceptionally rare thing of actually writing scenes that are genuinely unnerving. Yes, he often follows a pattern, but in no way are this books formulaic. This shorter book sees the return of the Jericho Company, which formed the basis of the novel Dark Echo. I guess I just like this formula. Something creepily evil happens to a nice person (such as finding a sketch of a cat torturing a mouse suddenly appear as your screensaver--see? Subtle, evil, unnerving). Research and interesting discoveries follow. I've said it before, but give this author a go. You won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Martin Belcher", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5636083-martin-belcher", "userReview": "A wonderfully wicked, spine tingling novella of modern supernatural horror. Tom Harper is a famous celebrity footballer who decides to buy a new flat in an old converted tenement block. Very soon, night after night, strange noises come from the basement, perfume smells and strange drawings on his laptop. Research leads to a previous occupant with links to the occult who took her own life. Tom's friend Rebecca helps Tom but finds she is mysteriously linked to the supernatural events which could claim her life and change Tom's forever..,...A highly recommended novella filled with suspense and spine chilling horror. Another superb F G Cottam book."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4996205-jan", "userReview": "This was a fantastic tale! I cannot recommend it highly enough! F. G. Cottam is in my opinion the best of contemporary writers of supernatural horror fiction. This particular novel was tightly constructed, fast-paced and atmospheric (do not read when you're Home Alone!). The supernatural elements are quite creatively introduced. They are subtle, but add up. To those of us who've read other Cottam novels, the signs and clues are reminiscent of previous chills but can be appreciated by new readers quite as much. The author introduces ordinary things as paranormally creepy and dangerous. His novels are page-turners and this is no exception. The characters are likeable, the scare factor climbs with each page, the connections within the novel and without to earlier stories are well-conceived. When reading Cottam it is wise to note word meanings: place names and sometimes character names are hints! I am often disappointed by books which suggest there is a ghost which turns out to be a child in a white sheet....this is never an issue in Cottam stories. The ghosts are vividly drawn and remain with one long after the last page has been turned. The haunting described in this book is an unusual and ... if one ponders ... terrifying one. If I could give more stars I would! A must-read!"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1925309-barbara", "userReview": "I've never read an F.G.

This would make an excellent Twilight Zone-style episode.I've read a fair number of his books now and would observe that Mr Cottam has carved himself a niche in creating believable, desirable vamps. I suspect he and I may have had similar formative experiences when it comes to women!Next up for me is his Dark Resurrection - even when he writes a middling story, he still keeps you coming back for the next one. Maybe 3 stars is a bit parsimonious."}, {"userName": "Lesley Henry", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41530066-lesley-henry", "userReview": "I just cannot get enough of Cottam's work. I enjoyed the story thoroughly, I just truly wish that it had been written as a novel rather than as a novella. Please don't get me wrong, it is a great story but there was room for more depth and exploration of the haunting. That is why I still rate it as a 5 star, I just think it was a wasted opportunity to have been something more, although it is still a good novella."}, {"userName": "Rachael", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11062132-rachael", "userReview": "A sweet little story with ghostly elements.I'd have loved for this to have been a longer story or novel that focuses more on Rachel who was such an interesting character.
