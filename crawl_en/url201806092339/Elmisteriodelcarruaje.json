The interview left me intrigued. At the time I was about to spend a weekend in Melbourne, so downloading the work, which is well and truly in the public domain, seemed like a good idea. The fact that it took me quite a few weeks to read, even though it's a relatively short work is an indication that I found it less than compelling. However, there wasn't a time when I considered abandoning it. The backstory of the author, the fact that the novel was a 19th century bestseller that out sold Conan Doyle's first work and its setting in a city I know all made me push through. As the title suggests, this is a whodunnit. There's a murder, a police officer or two, a falsely accused hero, a loyal heroine and some shady characters from the Melbourne underworld. It has the requisite number of red herrings, some rather stilted dialogue and a resolution that can't really be worked out from clues in the narrative. Crime fiction fans with an interest in the beginnings of the genre will be more interested in this work than others. It's not really something for the casual reader."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "The bottom line is that I really liked this book -- another ahhhhh read in my history-of-mystery project for 2017. It is yet another one, like The Leavenworth Case that comes right down to the wire in unmasking the killer, and yet another that belongs in the category of classic mystery fiction. The story itself is a mix of crime, investigations, courtroom drama, melodrama, and elements of sensation fiction, complete with dark secrets from the past. The novel begins with a report from the Argus on \"Saturday, the 28th of July, 18--\" telling its readers of an \"extraordinary murder\" that occurred in a most unlikely place -- a hansom cab:\"...committed by an unknown assassin, within a short distance of the principal streets of this great city, ... surrounded by an impenetrable mystery. Indeed, from the nature of the crime itself, the place where it was committed, and the fact that the assassin has escaped without leaving a trace behind him, it would seem as though the case itself had been taken bodily out of one of Gaboriau's novels, and that his famous detective Lecoq would only be able to unravel it.\"While it can be thought of as a detective novel in the sense that there are two men who are working on the case of the man who was murdered in the hansom cab in Melbourne, it is much more. True, there are detectives: the police detective, who eventually follows the small amount of clues to make an arrest, as set against the detective hired by the accused man's attorney to prove him innocent. At the same time, others are also doing their own bit of detection in this story, so to limit it by giving it the label of detective fiction isn't exactly right. It also delivers some pretty strong commentary and criticism on society of the time, which is, I think, one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. The book is also notable for its view of contemporary Melbourne -- it takes the reader through the city streets, from the gentility of the city's gentlemen's clubs down into its darker dens of vice. Add to that the elements of sensation fiction (which I love) and the characterizations; putting aside the melodrama, it all made for a couple of days of reading pleasure. It also really messes with reader expectations in a very big way. recommended for those who are into this older stuff.http://www.crimesegments.com/2017/12/..."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "Malcolm Royston, a cabman, was driving in Collins Street East, Melbourne at 1am on the 27th July 18-- when he was hailed by a gentleman who appeared to be supporting another man, presumably under the influence of too much liquor. When he pulled over, he was told to take the gentleman home, as he was \u201cawfully tight\u201d. He stated that he had found the man slumped by a lamp post and though he didn\u2019t know him, thought he\u2019d send him safely home. But suddenly the good Samaritan appeared to recognise the drunken man, and allowing him to slump to the ground, rushed off in disgust.Rousing him with difficulty Royston finally managed to make out that the man wanted to go to St Kilda \u2013 after navigating him into his cab, which turned out to be a bit of a struggle, he was about to drive off when the original man returned. He declared he would see the drunk home after all and entered the cab, seating himself next to the gentleman \u2013 Royston then proceeded to head for St Kilda. But a little later Royston found himself heading to the Police Station \u2013 the following investigation had the police convinced they had found their murderer; the ease of the arrest thrilled the investigative officer, Mr Gorby, immensely. Mr Calton on the other hand wasn\u2019t so convinced \u2013 his investigation was intense and thorough. What would he find? How would the lives of the participating players of this drama be affected?What an entertaining mystery! Written back in the 1880s it covers everything needed for a good mystery, with a number of characters, eccentric and otherwise. It was a little tedious to read at times, but I suppose that might have to do with the time it was written.

I\u2019d only read Australian Kerry Greenwood and Germaine Greer and Kiwi Ngaio Marsh up to that point. Magda was kind enough to send me a long list of excellent authors, including Fergus Hume. The English-born Hume grew up in New Zealand before relocating to Melbourne. Unable to get his plays even looked at \u2014 much less staged \u2014 he instead turned out his first mystery, The Mystery of the Hansom Cab, in 1886. It became an international sensation and inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to create Sherlock Holmes and pen A Study in Scarlet.The novel begins in colonial Australia with a cabbie picking up two gentlemen in evening dress, one of whom was falling-down drunk. The first gets out early, and, when the cabbie opens the door to let out the second at that gent\u2019s home, the cabbie discovers that the drunk fellow\u2019s been murdered. How can the authorities track down the accompanying gentleman, who must surely be the murderer?Mr. Gorby, a Melbourne police detective, discovers the victim\u2019s identity and arrests a suspect about halfway through the novel. But Mr. Gorby\u2019s rival on the police force, Mr. Kilsip, has very different ideas. As with any good 19th century mystery, more evidence will emerge that leads Mr. Gorby to reopen the case, and the two rivals will vie \u2014 along with the defense attorney Duncan Calton \u2014 to be the one to bring the true murderer to justice. Many modern readers decry 19th century mystery novels as dry and contrived, but The Mystery of the Hansom Cab proves as exciting as any by Lawrence Block, Sue Grafton, Dean Koontz, Tony Hillerman, Elizabeth Peters, Laurie R. King, or P.D. James. I couldn\u2019t put it down until I got to the very last chapter!The Mystery of the Hansom Cab provides readers with a taste of an Australian classic, indeed, one that predates the Australian federation by 15 years. While the novel provides a fun read in its own right, it\u2019s also nice to see the mystery that inspired the greatest fictional detective of all time, Sherlock Holmes."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56219968-irene", "userReview": "Una ambientaci\u00f3n exquisita del Melbourne del siglo XIX, que te transporta a los bajos fondos como si estuvieras en una peli; unos personajes, bien trabajados y una trama que no decae.

Fergus W. Hume. ***1/2.Hume was born in England, but migrated to Australia \u2013 living in Melbourne. This was his first mystery, and became a huge bestseller. It was the best selling mystery of the nineteenth century, surpassing the sales of the books of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 stories. He went on to write about one-hundred additional mysteries, but most of them have been forgotten. This first novel is still read, and not just by Australians. The Hansom cab, named after its inventor, an English architect named Joseph Hansom, was still fairly new. It was popular because of its small size, a size that could fit well within growing cities traffic. The story line in this book tells of two men who get into a cab, but only one gets out. The one left was later discovered by the driver to be dead. He had been murdered by means of chloroform. The identity of the second man was difficult to determine, since he was dressed like 90% of the other Melbourne men on the streets. There were no other witnesses. This novel, even after so many years, still reads well. Many of the tricks of the writing trade were used in its production so that it still seems fresh. The language is still a little stultified by our standards, but it isn\u2019t bad.

His family emigrated to Australia, where he became a barrister and aspired to be a writer. His early efforts were met with complete disinterest, and so, unwilling to admit defeat, he asked a local bookseller what type of book was most popular. The answer was detective novels, and so Hume bought and studied all of the works of the popular crime writer Emile Gaboriau that the bookstore had to offer.The result was \u2018The Mystery of a Hansom Cab\u2019, the first of some 130 books that the author would publish between 1886 and his death in 1932. That first book though was his only success. And it was a huge success; quite probably the best-selling detective story of the eighteenth century.Other books of the period may have stood the test of time better, may speak for their times more eloquently; other authors may have left a greater body of work; but this book has much to hold the interest.The book opens with a newspaper account of a murder. A drunken man had been put into a cab by another man, who instructed the driver to take him home. And when the driver stopped to ask his fare for directions not long afterwards, his passenger was dead, suffocated with a chloroform soaked handkerchief bearing the initials OW. There was nothing else that gave any clue to the dead man\u2019s identity, and nothing at all to indicate who the man who had put him into the cab \u2013 the man who must surely be his murderer \u2013 might be.Mr Gorby, the police detective at the head of the investigation, was very capable, and he was quick to establish that the dead man was Oliver Whyte, a newcomer to Melbourne society. It was interesting that Whyte had been courting Madge Frettlby, who was the only child of Mark Frettlby, one of the richest men in the city. Madge was in love with Brian Fitzgerald, an Irishman who had come to Melbourne to make his fortune; her father knew that, and yet he was encouraging Whyte\u2019s suit. Whyte and Fitzgerald were, understandably, on very bad terms. Gorby learned that Fitzgerald has been heard to threaten Whyte at his lodgings; he learned that Fitzgerald wore a light coat & wide brimmed hat, just like the man who had put Whyte into the cab; he learned that Fitzgerald had been out in the city that night. He was convinced that he had his man.Fitzgerald pleaded innocence, but herefused to provide an alibi for the time of the murder. He had one, but he would not use it because he knew that to do so would cause irreparable damage.It was fortunate that his lawyer, Mr Calton believed him, and prepared to investigate. Another police detective, Mr Kilslip, was convinced that his old rival, Mr Gorby, had got things wrong; and so the two men set out to uncover the truth.They came to understand why Fitzgerald wanted to keep a secret that he wished he had never been told, a terrible secret, with roots in England and Australia, involving some of the highest and some of the lowest of Melbourne society \u2026..The plot rattled along nicely, from crime, to investigation, to trial, to aftermath. And as it did that it shifted from crime story to sensation story. Hume did better with the former than the latter, and though I enjoyed most of the journey in the end I could see how things were going to play out and ready for the journey to be over.But I had found much to appreciate along the way:I admired the professionalism of the police and lawyers, and I was pleased that they all proved to be capable. I liked that there was some moral ambiguity in the way the story played out. And I found it easy to believe in these people, to believe in their world, and to enjoy spending time there.A hint of misogyny was disappointing, but Madge did develop into a credible heroine \u2013 albeit a woman of her time \u2013 after a shaky start, and this was a story about plot much more than characters. The characters did their job but no more.The very best thing though was the wealth of literary references that peppered the story, the many times when the characters mentioned something they\u2019d read about: I spotted Gaboriau, De Quincy, Zola, Braddon, and I suspect that there were others that I didn\u2019t recognise. Sometimes it felt a little contrived but it was lovely, and I loved the author\u2019s generosity of spirit.The authors I didn\u2019t see mentioned but whose influence I was sure I saw were Charles Dickens \u2013 in the slums \u2013 and Wilkie Collins \u2013 in the melodrama.Fergus Hume is nowhere near their class, but he has left the world a rather nice period entertainment, pitched at a very interesting point in the evolution of crime fiction."}, {"userName": "Dfordoom", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1048045-dfordoom", "userReview": "If asked to name the bestselling mystery novel of the 19th century, most people would probably suggest something by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, possibly The Hound of the Baskervilles. In fact the biggest selling 19th century mystery novel was Fergus Hume\u2019s The Mystery of a Hansom Cab. Hume was born in England but brought up in New Zealand, and was living in Australia when he wrote the book. The book is set in Melbourne. He went on to write a further 131 crime novels.The book opens with a cabby discovering a dead man, identity unknown, in his hansom cab. Police investigations soon establish the victim\u2019s identity, and circumstantial evidence points towards a wealthy young squatter, Brian Fitzgerald. . It soon becomes clear that Fitzgerald is hiding something, and is prepared to face the hangman\u2019s noose rather than reveal the secret. By modern standards I\u2019d describe it as a crime melodrama. There are gentlemen declaring their intention to die rather than put a lady\u2019s honour at risk. There are dreadful family secrets. There are surprise witnesses. There is a convoluted plot involving some unlikely coincidences. The final resolution is suspiciously neat. It\u2019s all very breathless. On the other hand Hume does introduce enough twists to maintain the reader\u2019s interest, and the book is quite entertaining. One interesting feature is that both the detectives involved in the case are police detectives rather than amateur sleuths, and both police officers are shown to be intelligent and efficient, and very professional. The Mystery of a Hansom Cab was immensely influential at the time, and was a worldwide bestseller. Conan Doyle is known to have read it.

As a mystery I must admit it is a bit slight and the identity of the killer is given away very early in the piece, but for this reader its main charm lies in its depiction of my own home town, Melbourne, Australia, where the novel was written and set. The novel takes us to the moneyed salons of The Melbourne Club, the elegance of The Block, the slums of Little Bourke Street, the sweet sea air of St Kilda and the sweltering heat of a Victorian rural station, all of which are evoked with the authenticity that can only be attained by an eye-witness. Whatever its achievement as a mystery, I\u2019m sure this characteristic made a large contribution to the novel\u2019s success, especially in Melbourne.Its author, Fergus Hume, was born in England and migrated to New Zealand as a child with his family. After qualifying as a lawyer, he left New Zealand for the most dynamic city of the colonies at the time, Marvellous Melbourne. There, however, rather than settling for a career in the law, Hume was determined to make a name for himself as a writer. After failing to interest any of the theatres in his plays, Hume decided to write a novel, but not just any novel, a best-seller. Enquiring of a bookseller what kind of novel was the most popular, he was told it was the detective mysteries of Emile Gaboriau. After having read all of Gaboriau\u2019s mysteries, Hume produced his own, The Mystery of a Hansom Cab.A dashing young man about town is found drunk in a city street. A man who appears to know him hails a hansom cab and offers to accompany the drunk to his home, but half way there the Good Samaritan seems to argue with his friend and gets out of the cab, sending the driver on. When the driver tries to rouse his remaining passenger he finds him dead. Thus begins a mystery that incorporates all the elements one expects from a nineteenth century melodrama \u2013 a beautiful and innocent young heiress, a terrible secret, and an honourable young man who would rather face death than reveal it. But apart from these clich\u00e9s, Hume gives his mystery an air of authenticity with newspaper articles, court transcripts and police procedures. It is much livened by some rather eccentric characters including an alcoholic slum matriarch, a pair of garrulous landladies, and two rival detectives each pursuing opposing lines of investigation. But the investigation is actually a small part of this novel which focuses, rather, on the people whose lives have been affected by the murder \u2013 the young woman the dead man had once courted, her fianc\u00e9 who is accused of his murder, and her father, a millionaire with a mysterious past.Having written his novel, Hume approached several publishers and came up against an attitude that still lingers today, that nothing good could possibly come out of Australia. So Hume did what many authors are still forced to do. He scraped the money together to self-publish his book. Despite the publishers\u2019 prejudices, the first print run of 5,000 copies sold out in three weeks and a second print run was produced. However, Hume lacked the capital to take his novel to the British and American markets, so sold those rights for \u00a350. Hume did not see another penny for sales of 750,000, or the stage adaptation which ran in London for 500 nights. Hume followed his creation to London where he continued his career as a writer, but without ever again seeing the success of his first novel.The Mystery of a Hansom Cab is an entertaining mystery in its own right, a remarkable example of the origins of the detective novel, and a delightful evocation of its time and place.

Desde ese tiempo, hay que reconocer que varias editoriales, peque\u00f1as, independientes, adem\u00e1s de Alba, est\u00e1n acometiendo la gratificante labor de recuperaci\u00f3n de historias de esa \u00e9poca con el com\u00fan denominador de tratarse de historias con un enfoque muy cl\u00e1sico (de dicha \u00e9poca) y de ser novelas de detectives. Una de esas editoriales brilla con luz propia: d\u00c9poca; ha adoptado un sello de identidad tremendamente diferenciador, reconocible incluso a la distancia (muy al estilo de Impedimenta por poner un ejemplo del estilo): ediciones de cl\u00e1sicos victorianos en tapa dura, con ilustraciones de \u00e9poca y portadas muy caracter\u00edsticas.El misterio del carruaje de Fergus Hume es un ejemplo que aglutina a la perfecci\u00f3n estos rasgos; en la introducci\u00f3n, se pone en contexto la importancia de Hume y sus desaveniencias con el m\u00e1s conocido Arthur Conan Doyle (y ya de paso se avanza la publicaci\u00f3n del libro de Cauvain, que alg\u00fan d\u00eda aparecer\u00e1 por este blog):\u201cEn su d\u00eda, el creador de Sherlock Holmes despreci\u00f3 en una carta privada el trabajo de Fergus Hume, pero no es menos cierto que el propio Arthur Conan Doyle tiene una importante deuda literaria con algunos de sus contempor\u00e1neos \u2013entre los que podemos destacar a \u00c9mile Gaboriau y , por encima de todo, a Henry Cauvain-, y algunos aspectos de Estudio en Escarlata tienen importantes similitudes con la obra de Hume que nos ocupa, \u201cEl misterio del carruaje\u201d, comenzando por la notable rivalidad de los dos detectives comprometidos oficialmente en la investigaci\u00f3n, y ciertos aspectos del modus operandi del asesino.Conan Doyle y Hume, por otra parte, con el tiempo tomaron caminos muy diferentes en la novela polic\u00edaca. Mientras Doyle se centr\u00f3 en desarrollar el marcado car\u00e1cter de su protagonista, los detectives Gorby y Kilsip, creados por la pluma de Hume, se convirtieron en dos meros actores dentro del conjunto de personajes de sus tramas.\u201dAdem\u00e1s de contar una de esas caracter\u00edsticas m\u00e1s t\u00edpicas de la \u00e9poca, la confrontaci\u00f3n de detectives, m\u00e1s que el desarrollo de un detective en particular, como era el caso de Doyle y su Holmes; curiosamente la evoluci\u00f3n de sus novelas no tendi\u00f3 al solipsismo sino al relato coral. Otra de las peculiaridades del relato tiene que ver con el lugar en el que se encuentra el cad\u00e1ver, un coche de punto:\u201cLa historia comienza cuando un hombre es hallado muerto en el interior de un coche de punto y uno de los m\u00e1s distinguidos ciudadanos de la ciudad es acusado de asesinato.

Beaconsfield dice en una de sus novelas que nunca resulta uno tan interesante como cuando habla de s\u00ed mismo, y desde esta perspectiva, la se\u00f1ora Hableton era una mujer realmente fascinante, pues jam\u00e1s se ocupaba de otro asunto. \u00bfQu\u00e9 le importaba a ella la amenaza de una invasi\u00f3n rusa frente a un disgusto personal? Aunque una vez desaparecido este, ten\u00eda tiempo para preocuparse de los m\u00e1s nimios detalles concernientes a Australia.El problema de la se\u00f1ora Hableton era la falta de dinero. Esto no ten\u00eda nada de extraordinario, pero si se le hac\u00eda esta observaci\u00f3n a la se\u00f1ora Hableton, ella contestaba con tono desabrido \u201cque lo sab\u00eda, pero que no todas las personas eran iguales.\u201d Esta misteriosa respuesta ten\u00eda la siguiente explicaci\u00f3n: hab\u00eda llegado a Australia en una \u00e9poca en que no era dif\u00edcil, como hoy, hacer fortuna; pero al haber dado con un mal marido, no hab\u00eda conseguido prosperar. El difunto se\u00f1or Hableton \u2013porque hac\u00eda largo tiempo que hab\u00eda entregado su alma a Dios- se hab\u00eda consagrado con total desenfreno a la adoraci\u00f3n a Baco, y el tiempo que deber\u00eda haber empleado en ganarse la vida lo hab\u00eda pasado en las tabernas, derrochando la econom\u00eda de su mujer, obsequiando a los amigos y despreocup\u00e1ndose del porvenir.\u201dEspecialmente palpable es esta caracter\u00edstica si atendemos a la presentaci\u00f3n de los antit\u00e9ticos detectives, es imposible no pensar en Dickens o en el posterior Chesterton al leer una descripci\u00f3n tan ingeniosa y realizada por continuas contraposiciones que mezclan lo f\u00edsico con lo psicol\u00f3gico:\u201cHab\u00eda un viejo dicho popular que dice: \u201clos que se parecen se juntan\u201d. La ant\u00edtesis podr\u00eda ser que los que no se parecen se repelen. Pero hay ocasiones en que las individualidades no cuentan y es solo el destino el que juega su papel, reuniendo a dos personas y coloc\u00e1ndolas en una situaci\u00f3n placentera o desagradable, seg\u00fan el caso. El destino escogi\u00f3 unir al se\u00f1or Gorby y al se\u00f1or Kilsip, y cada uno le resultaba m\u00e1s que antip\u00e1tico al otro. Ambos eran igualmente h\u00e1biles en su profesi\u00f3n. Cada uno era el favorito de todo el mundo, pero cada uno era odiado por su oponente. Eran como el agua y el fuego, y cuando se encontraban siempre surg\u00edan problemas.Kilsip era alto y delgado; Gorby era bajo y regordete. Kilsip ten\u00eda aspecto de persona astuta; Gorby ten\u00eda siempre en los labios una sonrisa de autosatisfacci\u00f3n que por s\u00ed sola podr\u00eda ser suficiente para impedirle realizar bien su trabajo. No obstante, era precisamente esa misma sonrisa simplona la que le resultaba m\u00e1s \u00fatil a Gorby en sus pesquisas. Le permit\u00eda conseguir informaci\u00f3n donde su astuto colega lo intentaba en vano. Por lo general, los corazones se dejaban cautivar por la dulce sonrisa y las c\u00e1ndidas maneras de un hombre como Gorby, y se retiraban con premura y se cerraban herm\u00e9ticamente, como caracoles alarmados dentro de sus conchas, ante la apariencia de Kilsip. Gorby desment\u00eda con su fisonom\u00eda a cuantos dicen que la cara es el espejo del alma.\u201dLatente en pr\u00e1cticamente todo momento est\u00e1 la lucha de clases y el asentamiento en lo terrenal, los fantasmas se crean por personas vivas y no hay que tener miedo de lo sobrenatural, hay una explicaci\u00f3n emp\u00edrica disponible m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de espectros:\u201c-Seg\u00fan creo, solo los miembros de la aristocracia poseen un fantasma en la familia \u2013dijo Madge-; ese es el motivo por el que los colonos no tenemos ninguno.-Pero t\u00fa s\u00ed que lo tendr\u00e1s \u2013respondi\u00f3 Brian, con una sonrisa despreocupada-.

No existen los fantasmas, salvo aquellos que el propio hombre engendra; los fantasmas de la juventud perdida, los de las estupideces cometidas en el pasado, aquellos que ponen de relieve lo que podr\u00eda haber sido y no fue\u2026 esos son los espectros a los que hay que temer, y no los que se encuentran en el camposanto.\u201dEl caso es llevado de manera muy ingeniosa hasta llegar a un final muy consecuente con lo narrado. Sinceramente, estas narraciones, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de un factor nost\u00e1lgico, suelen estar insufladas de un buen hacer que a\u00fana prosa de calidad, buen humor y personajes espl\u00e9ndidamente caracterizados.

I purchased the Text Classics version at the NLA bookshop while in Canberra last week for $12.95 but of course you can read it for free online if you so desire only you might find that those editions are bowdlerised. I really like Text Classics because, a bit like Penguin Classics, they always come with an Introduction which sets the work in the context of the time it was published. In this instance Simon Caterson advises us that this was the best-selling crime novel of the nineteenth century. And it was self-published. Who knew? Personally I found it a bit long and drawn-out and there was not one female character who inspired me. In fact I was rather aghast at the ferocity with which some female characters were derided. It was obviously a sport in Edwardian times to mock those of a lower class (mostly women) for their faults in speech, dress or habits. It was with relief that I laughed at the name of the Piano Tutor Signor Thumpanini. However most if not all female characters were on the whole vapid, a source of amusement or to be reviled which left me rather glum.

A body is found murdered in a Hansom Cab, and police soon discover that it's a man named Oliver Whyte. But now the real question is, who on earth is the killer and why was he killed? Through some investigation, detective Mr. Gorby believes it to be Brian Fitzgerald, a man who is said to have despised Whyte for wanting to marry his lover, Madge Frettlby. After a lengthy investigation into the evidence, both for and against, it is determined that Brian is innocent, and that someone is trying to frame him - but who did want Whyte dead, and what secret do the papers stolen from Whyte's pocket reveal? This was a very enjoyable read, even though I did end up listening to a majority of it via audiobook. I really enjoyed the two opening chapters, the first of which is the newspaper article regarding the event, and the second the evidence report. It was a creative way to introduce the main event of the story, enabling the rest of the book to focus on the mystery of the murderer. By using this way of storytelling, Hume was able to persuade the reader to believe that each of the suspects were the murderer, which I really enjoyed. I definitely didn't see the final result coming, but it all fitted into the story. The story gave such a great insight into Australian and Melbournian life during the late 1800s, and I could picture the events unfolding in the city. During the few chapters, it felt like the story was based off a true crime, even though no such event had occurred. Hume did an excellent job at pulling the reader into 19th century Melbourne, showing the wealth of the upper-class and the poverty of the back-alley slums. It's really interesting to see that this book was the bestselling crime novel of the nineteenth century, and not Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. I hadn't heard of this book prior to having to study it for university and I'm really glad that I have read it. It's a great piece of Australian literature.Overall, I highly recommend this book, especially to those who enjoy crime fiction and novels set in Australia. It's such a great mystery novel and you'll be unsure as to who the murderer was for the majority of the story."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JC-S)", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s", "userReview": "\u2018The best-selling crime novel of the nineteenth century.\u2019\u2018Truth is said to be stranger than fiction, and certainly the extraordinary murder which took place in Melbourne on Thursday night, or rather Friday morning, goes a long way towards verifying this saying.\u2019Melbourne, 18--. An unknown man is found dead in a hansom cab late one night. How did he die? Earlier, this man and another unknown man had hailed a hansom cab and had asked to be taken to St Kilda. The unknown man changed his mind and walked away. Then the man appeared to change his mind again, and got into the hansom cab. Part way through the journey he asks the cab driver to stop, gets out, and heads back to the city. A little further on, the cab driver, trying to establish exactly which address he is to attend, discovers the dead body of the man in the back of his cab.The police first need to identify the victim. Once they do, they then move quite quickly to arrest and charge a man with his murder. But do they have the right man? Eventually, gentle reader, after a number of twists and turns, the truth will be ascertained.And what interesting twists and turns they prove to be. The novel is peopled with interesting characters, including the dreadful Mother Guttersnipe, and the busy Mrs Sampson. We have a number of potential heroes and actual villains, and just when I thought I\u2019d worked it out, yet another possibility appeared. Plenty of old-fashioned detecting here.This novel was first published in 1886, and has not been out of print since. It predates Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s \u2018A Study in Scarlet\u2019 by one year, and was an overnight sensation when it was originally published.

I'm living in inner Melbourne, so this book is a little special to me - it is amazing how many of the locations still carry the same mood and feeling that Fergus Hume evokes in his book. Although Little Bourke Street is no longer seedy, it is easy to imagine the poverty and shady deals that would have taken place in the narrow laneways that still exist in this part of Melbourne today. East Melbourne is still posh, and Fitzroy Gardens are still spooky when used as a short cut to walk home late at night.The character development is good and you get a good feel for the lifestyle of the rich and famous at a time when Melbourne was growing quickly as a result of the gold rush. The women are particularly strong characters - they are critical to the most interesting elements of the plot. We also get a pretty graphic account of life for people stuck in poverty - nothing much changes over the ages. Hume also writes in a very clever tone where there is an under current of social criticism and sarcasm that still connects with modern day readers. One particularly amusing account of a shopping trip by one of the women characters was particularly relevant to current time: \"After Madge had purchased a dozen articles she did not want, and had interviewed her dressmaker on the momentous subject of a new dress, she remembered that Brian was waiting for her,and hurried quickly to the door.\""}, {"userName": "Grace", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20680751-grace", "userReview": "Two men got into a cab in the dead of night, one of whom asked to be dropped off first whilst the other was later found dead by the driver. As the story progresses, the detective who was assigned to this case, Mr. Gorby went around Melbourne looking for clues of the identities of the passengers, particularly that of the supposed murderer. The Mystery of a Hansom Cab transported me to 19th century Melbourne. Amidst the mystery of the murder in a hansom cab, it showed me glimpses of the lifestyles of the rich and the poor Melbournians at the time. I was particularly fascinated with the use of the Melbourne landscape in the story. According to my literature professor, the city shapes the story. In the case of this book, I definitely see his point. The clues are part of the landscape and for some clues, they are part of the landscape as well. The suspense kept me guessing at the identity of the murderer. I had heaps of fun playing detective throughout my read that I finished the story in one sitting.

I think what I enjoyed most were his character portrayals, particularly for the supporting characters.

To a native of Melbourne, the description of the city is delightful, in particular the slums of Little Bourke street. There's plenty of interesting social history contained in it too. Sure there were bits when the novel strained a little, and parts where it dragged, but we should remember that it predates Sherlock Holmes, and almost certainly influenced Conan-Doyle, who had read it by the time he started A Study in Scarlet.
