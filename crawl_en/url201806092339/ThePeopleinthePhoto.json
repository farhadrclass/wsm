Knowing very little about her mother except that she died in an accident when Helene was four, she places an advert with the photo in the newspapers. She receives a reply from a young biologist in Switzerland who claims one of the men in the photo is his late father.From there, in a series of letter, e-mails and postcards, Helene and St\u00e9phane attempt to solve the mystery of her mother and the fact that her father would never mention her name, and his father and his depressive, aloof nature. I enjoyed this easy but poignant read. As they unravel clues, letters and at last journals from a friend of both parents and the letter left from her adopted mother after her death, they at last learn the true story. They also form a personal relationship, but will that survive the knowledge they now have on how their parents were connected? Can they forgive what they learn of their parents actions and can they now move forward?"}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "Coming 2014 from Gallic BooksTranslated from the French by: Emily Boyce and Ros SchwartzThank you to Gallic for the lovely surprise of a copy of this book in the post.The three figures in the photograph are frozen forever, two men and a woman bathed in sunlight . . .The chance discovery of a newspaper image from 1971 sets two people on the path to learning the disturbing truth about their parents\u2019 pasts.Helene Hivert discovers a photograph of her mother, a woman she knows little about, and advertises for information about the two men pictured with her \u2013 so starts a correspondence with Stephane Crusten, and a journey of discovery. As the two start to piece together the past, painful possibilities arise.This is classic, beautiful storytelling \u2013 a tale of family secrets and age old dilemma\u2019s coming to light in a compelling, sometimes sad, perfectly paced novel. Written with a rich, evocative prose and giving voice to two elegantly drawn people who are seeking answers about their childhoods and their parentage, Ms Gestern breathes life and soul into her characters as the people in the photo come to life.Told via letters between Helene and Stephane, interspersed with descriptive chapters of other discovered photo\u2019s, we follow avidly in their wake as they begin to learn more about their history and where they have come from. Each newly discovered nugget leads on to the next \u2013 like a literary game of pass the parcel, each layer reveals another and another until finally the gift of full disclosure emerges. At turns fascinating, heartbreaking, passionate and astonishing, this one will touch your reading soul.It may bring a tear to your eye \u2013 it did to mine- ultimately this was that very wonderful thing, an absolutely fulfilling reading experience.

H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hiver knows virtually nothing about her mother who died when she was four. She learned early never to question her father and stepmother, fearing their anger. But she is now thirty nine years old, her father dead three years and stepmother Sylvia who raised her is without any memory in a rest home. She finds a newspaper clipping in her father's office, her mother young and beautiful accompanied by two men. From her apartment in Paris, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne casts a net with newspaper ads in France and Switzerland and gets the one important reply. St\u00e9phane C\u00fcstin and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne begin the search into the mystery of her mother and the unexplained presence of Pierre C\u00fcstin, St\u00e9phane's father, in the photo. St\u00e9phane lives in England and travels frequently for business. They communicate with letters which include copies of other findings, email, text messages and slowly they begin to admit their first suspicions of their parents' possible clandestine love affair. People keep secrets. The cost is borne as empty places where partial memories or disrupted bonds meld, in next generations. Painful facts are unearthed, some explaining and others devastating.H\u00e9l\u00e8ne writes to St\u00e9phane, \"There is no denying we have suffered. ....But the conclusion you came to in an earlier letter is the right one. We are now the sole beneficiaries of this past, so we alone are responsible for deciding what to do with it.\"There is a lovely cadence to the epistolary style of The a People in the Window. One voice calls, another answers and each echo the other's confidences in a rhythm not unlike poetry. As suspense builds, they comfort each other until a point of dissonance, of suffering, cannot be contained. The ending is wistful, in fact one might say that of the whole story.

I\u2019m inclined to be a little wary of books like that, books that are often too serious and too modern for my taste, but I fell in love with this particular book. It tells wonderfully moving and though-provoking human story; and it is so very east to read, to become involved, to keep turning the pages because you care about these people and you need to know what happens \u2026.H\u00e9l\u00e8ne didn\u2019t remember her mother, who had died when she was an infant, and no one would ever speak of her. Her father, her step-mother, anyone who might have known her mother drew a careful veil over the past.But H\u00e9l\u00e8ne found a picture, a picture of her mother as a very young woman, at a tennis tournament with two young men she did not recognise at all. Her need to know more was overwhelming, and so she placed an advertisement, asking for more information about the people in the photo.St\u00e9phane, a Swiss scientist who lived and worked in England, responded. He recognised one of the young men as his father, and that made him realise that he also had unanswered questions about his own history.Each hoped to learn more from the other, and so they continued to correspond \u2013 by letter, by email, by text message. Slowly and steadily they find out more about their parents, their history, and the relationship between them.They are intelligent, they are articulate, and that illuminates their correspondence. Their words bring H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and St\u00e9phane to life, as real, complicated, living, breathing human beings. Two people drawn together by their need for answers about their childhoods and the secrets of the past that their parents have kept from them.The photographs they found were described so beautifully that I could see the past, could see the people in their photo. That was lovely, and it gave brought those people to life too, and set them apart from the story in the present and the questions being asked about them.There were photographs from the Swiss mountains, the Brittany coast, and the streets of Paris \u2026.The plot was intricately and cleverly constructed. Sometimes questions led to answers, and sometimes they would lead to more questions. There were moments of understanding, moments of despair, moments of doubt, moments of hope, before the final pieces fell into place.I loved that as well as the big picture there were so many little nuances. Little things like a change in salutation, a change in tone, made this correspondence so very real.At times it was predictable, but sometimes people are predictable.If I have reservations, it was because I felt that at times the story ran too smoothly. Sometimes answers came too easily, suspense was maintained artificially, there was a little too much good luck \u2026..But the story held me, because I believed in these people, I cared about them, and I was caught up with their emotional journey and their voyage of discovery from the first page to the last."}, {"userName": "Jeanette Grant-Thomson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49586099-jeanette-grant-thomson", "userReview": "This is a book of letters, emails, text messages and diary excerpts, with each chapter beginning with a segment written in no-point-of-view prose, like a text book (or omniscient author).

It\u2019s an emotional trauma, not necessarily bad, but definitely something you cannot ignore nor can you afford to overlook, because you stay completely stunned and mesmerized by what you have just read.As usual one may wonder exactly what am I blubbering about?I am talking about \u201cThe People in the Photo\u201d by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gestern (Translated by Emily Boyce and Ros Schwartz). Now on the face of it, it may not be a book I usually pick up \u2013 I mean its French (can\u2019t abide by it!! I love France and its people and its food, but I somehow cannot make up my mind about their literature \u2013 I think the tragedies of Madame Bovary and Les Miserables hangs over me!!) its set in present day and as everyone knows I am most comfortable in 19th century and a brief synopsis looked suspiciously of a Kate Morton novel married to a romance chick lit. (I like Kate Morton and like all chicks I do dig into romance once in a while, but somehow put them together and it seems like a Rebecca wanna be!) But the clich\u00e9 of never judging a book by its cover came absolutely true in this instance.The book opens with a description of a picture and \u201cthe people\u2019 in the picture and this unique start to the narrative is in itself a wonderful beginning. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne an archivist is looking for some answers \u2013 she wants to know who the two people are in the picture and if they had any information about her mother, the third person in the picture. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s mother Natasha died when she was very young and was brought up by her father and her step mother Sylvie. Now Sylvie is the last stage of Alzheimer disease and her father has already died couple of years ago. In an effort to understand her roots before it completely slips away, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne puts out an advertisement in the paper seeking more information about the other two people in the photograph. St\u00e9phane, a Swiss biologist settled in England responds to the advertisement stating the two men in the picture are known to him \u2013 his father and his Godfather. However he has no idea how the two men knew H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s mother! As they begin to communicate more often they delve into the past of Natasha and Pierre and Jean and Sylvia and how they all were connected and how each of their lives were shaped by the actions of the past!It\u2019s a beautiful work narrated through letters, emails and texts; the only descriptive chapters are the ones a photograph is explained. The details of these photographs are richly drawn and one can practically see those pictures in one\u2019s mind, so vivid are the imagery of the words. The characters are rich and more importantly, they are all human \u2013 there is good, bad and ugly and the ability to repent and to forgive, the wide array of emotions that make a human, humane. Most importantly, what could have been a clich\u00e9d story, has been very cleverly crafted into a lovely heart searing sometimes tragic and sometimes optimistic tale. This novel is a testimony to the fact that while the stories of mankind are more or less the same, how you choose to tell those stories, proves your worth as a storyteller. Ms. Gestern has definitely proved she is worthy and so much more \u2013 an awesome debut!!A last word of Thanks to Jane; it was her wonderful review of this book that prompted me to read it.

Two of the people in the photo from 1971 are named, the second man is not. Helene knows that the woman in the photo is her mother, but neither of the men are her father. She was raised by her father and stepmother, and they both hid information about her birth mother from her. Why? What are they hiding? Helene gets a response from Stephane, who has seen the paper and recognises one of the men in the photo as his father. He also has information about the other man. A correspondance begins between Helene and Stephane - she wanting to learn about her mother, he wanting to learn more about his father, who was very closed off and private. The book is written in the form of emails, letters and text messages between Helene and Stephane. Sadly this isn't \"The Jolly Postman\" - there are no font changes or special papers or anything. This format makes it easy to read and easy to follow. It was like an extra-long episode of Long Lost Family, with little bits of information and history being slowly revealed until Helene and Stephane discover the truth. I found it dragged in places, and I really didn't like Helene. She dithered and she made a big deal about little things. I know she was looking for information, but she had it there in front of her for ages and \"couldn't get the courage\" to open it?! Surely if you were waiting years to find out about your mother, you'd open it straight away?! The tale itself was sad, it was a melancholy story about love and loss, sadness and regret. I suppose it was to tell the characters to live for now, and to do what makes them happy in the moment, but I didn't connect with either of them and I wasn't overly bothered about what they did, to be honest.I really think there should have been photos included with the book. While the author and translator both have extraordinary skills in describing details of photographs, the addition of at least one or two would have peaked my interest a little more.

It goes to show you that all you need is a good author who knows how to write to bring life to any story. The way this story was told with the back and forth correspondence was nice. I liked that the author made the story move faster by jumped days or even weeks between Helene and Stephane.

She places a newspaper advertisement with a photograph, asking for information about the people in it. One of them is her mother, Nathalie, and then there are two men in the photography with her. It was taken in 1971 at a tennis tournament in Interlaken. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's mother died when she was only three years old. She receives a response from St\u00e9phane, informing her that his father Pierre was one of the two men in the photograph. St\u00e9phane is Swiss, a biologist currently living in Kent, England. After his initial response, further correspondence is undertaken between the two, and they reveal memories and gaps in their pasts to each other, increasingly able to confide in each other. They uncover more about their pasts and those of their parents. But it remains to be seen whether the things they discover will help or hurt them, bring them relief and understanding or pain and sadness; either way, the revelations will affect and change their lives:'...I'm aware that digging up the past is risky. Who knows what secrets they were trying to protect us from and at what cost?'H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's father disclosed little about her mother, and she was raised by a loving stepmother too. After her father's death she found the photograph of her mother with the two men, and decided to now try and find out more about Nathalie. Some of the pair's relatives have passed away, so they must look harder sometimes if they are to continue the search for the truth that has been hidden in history.I loved this book. Once I started reading, I was captivated by the story, I cared about the characters and I didn't want to stop reading until I'd finished it. The narrative is told predominantly through the exchanges between H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and St\u00e9phane via the content of their letters, emails and text messages. It was incredibly moving to be an observer of their exchanges, reading how their connection to each other developed and evolved as they corresponded, and to notice the similarities in some of the feelings and emotions they had experienced in their lives:'I too feel that inner emptiness, which you describe so poignantly. And, as I grow older, I find it increasingly hard to bear.'There is a very understandable need to find answers, to discover their real background, so that they might feel a truer sense of themselves too:'You told me you found it difficult to come to terms with your background. As for me, I've been plagued by anxiety my whole life. My mind is filled with images I can't explain, scenes of catastrophe and things falling apart. I have rarely been able to shake this sense of anguish, even at what should have been the happiest times of my life.'This aspect in particular really appealed to me; who doesn't wonder about those parts of their past and their family's past that they know little of, and if this relates to a parent, even more so. Another part to the narrative, interspered amongst the correspondence, are descriptions of further old photographs; these are uncovered as the story progresses, and each sheds light on another aspect of the past. Each is beautifully described by the author, so that without having them in front of us, it is almost as if we do, and we can picture them in our minds eye. The People in the Photo is a wonderful, emotional and very moving read, definitely a keeper for me, and a book I'd love to read again. I do like epistolary novels and this form works very well here, brought up to date by the use of email and text. There are themes of love and friendship, identity and memory, confronting and dealing with the past, and finding forgiveness. There's always a sense of intrigue and wonder when we look at old photographs of people and this novel captures this and delivers a great story via this starting point. One of my favourite reads so far this year. Beautifully written and translated, I loved the structure and the way the story was told, so I'd certainly recommend this novel. I hope there will be more novels from this author."}, {"userName": "Nanou", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16091222-nanou", "userReview": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hivert n\u2019a pas connu sa m\u00e8re, Nathalie morte alors qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait que trois ans.

Lorsque St\u00e9phane doit partir travailler en Islande, la correspondance avec H\u00e9l\u00e8ne se fait par mail afin de gagner du temps. Quelquefois, ils \u00e9changeront des SMS, surtout une fois qu\u2019ils se seront rencontr\u00e9s en face \u00e0 face. Mais de ces rencontres, le lecteur en saura tr\u00e8s peu, m\u00eame lorsque la relation \u00e9volue au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019amiti\u00e9. Et c\u2019est cette pudeur que j\u2019ai aim\u00e9 dans ce livre, d\u00e9licat et \u00e9mouvant sans jamais \u00eatre mi\u00e8vre. De nombreux billets \u00e0 propos de ce livre font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Quand souffle le vent du Nord de Daniel Glattauer, \u00e0 cause de sa forme \u00e9pistolaire, sans doute. En ce qui me concerne, il n\u2019y a rien de semblable entre ces deux livres, si ce n\u2019est le genre. Autant j\u2019avais d\u00e9test\u00e9 le minaudage d\u2019Emmy, autant j\u2019ai appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 ici la justesse des \u00e9motions et la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 des correspondants. Plusieurs fois, les d\u00e9couvertes menacent de bouleverser leur relation mais tour \u00e0 tour, chacun trouve des ressources pour continuer la qu\u00eate et se m\u00e9fier des faux-semblants. Ce livre est une r\u00e9ussite et je le recommande fortement."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6265511-kate", "userReview": "This is an epistolary novel, meaning that the story is revealed through a series of correspondences; in this case, between Helene and Stephane.Helene lost her mother at age 3, though details pertaining to her mother have always been shrouded in mystery, and the mere mention of her mother and the cause of her death had only been met with stony silence, discomfort and anger.Now approaching middle age, Helene's father has died and she finds herself sorting through his papers, only to find an old newspaper clipping of a tennis club presentation, captioning the woman in the photo as Nathalie, Helene's mother. She stands alongside two men. With ignited curiosity about her mother and her life, Helene forms a desperate plea for information, through a newspaper ad, requesting information about the two men in the photo. After many weeks, Helene receives a reply from Stephane, who might have some longed for answers for Helene about her mother, but little do they know, they are about to open a Pandora's Box.Rather than a \"who dunnit\", this is a who-is-it. The intrigue and curiosity about the people in the photo immediately draws the reader in, and continues,as each letter or email reveals a little more or dispels this or that theory.In addition to the family mystery, the relationship between Parisian Helene and Swiss born, UK residing Stephane develops with the arrival of each correspondence and their shared childhood pains and present day need \"to know\".Many times Helene was presented with articles that might surely bring her closer to having her questions answered, but avoided opening a parcel or letter, and I really wanted to scream - JUST OPEN THE DAMN THING, but with patience the mystery is revealed."}, {"userName": "Debbie Robson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1743317-debbie-robson", "userReview": "Every now and then it is wonderful to find a book that you can just grab and race through the pages.

It matches the intensity of the chapters devoted solely to describing a photograph or a journal entry.

St\u00e9phane, a Swiss biologist living in Kent, responds: his father is one of the people in the photo. More letters and more photos pass between them as they embark on a journey to uncover the truth their parents kept from them. But will the images and documents from the past fill the silences left by the players?The author has given the protagonist her own first name - when that happens, I do have to wonder if it is partly autobiographical (although H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is a very pretty name!). H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is well captured - gentle, curious, reflective, desperate to unearth her truth but loath to upset others. Obviously a sad childhood. I struggled a little more with St\u00e9phane and actually preferred him when he cracked a bit every now and again. The epistolary style, in a sense, permits very limited development of any other characters, but then the whole book is about piecing together people from several decades ago and Nataliya is revealed little by little. Jean Pamiat, the side-lined friend, is actually my favourite character in the whole book, I think. He's deliciously omnipresent, and thankfully still alive in the modern time for our detectives to at least visit.I've said it before - I love the epistolary novel. It permits gentle development of the story (and the sub-story - just the right way to deliver that) without being slow. Had it been told another way I might well have thrown the book aside in frustration with the romance and the clunky delivery of the decades-old mystery - but this method was natural and elegant.For me, the aspect I walk away with is the incredible sadness of the ending. The climax is correctly paced and the puzzle is appropriately concluded, including various characters' odd behaviour, but this tale of love lost, found and lost again is really very sad in the end. Our characters put a brave face on it but... I would not be so sanguine.It made me want to learn Russian! And mourn the lost art of the letter. I greatly enjoyed the adventures of Bourbaki the cat as told by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne - and the sub-story, which I cannot reveal for spoiler-avoidance reasons, is sweetly developed in the letters."}], "description": "The three figures in the photograph are frozen forever, two men and a woman bathed in sunlight . . .The chance discovery of a newspaper image from 1971 sets two people on the path to learning the disturbing truth about their parents\u2019 pasts.Parisian archivist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne takes out a newspaper advert calling for information about her mother, who died when she was three, and the two men pictured with her in a photograph taken at a tennis tournament at Interlaken in 1971.
