Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart.\"\nWilliam Stoner grew up on a farm, a hardscrabble farm too small to provide more than just subsistence living. They were an undersized family for that time period, just his father and mother and himself. It took all of them to keep up with the backbreaking work of a farm in the early 20th century. His father, in his own way, a visionary man could see that farming was on the cusp of great changes. He sent Stoner to the University of Missouri to find out what the future was going to be for agriculture. Stoner wasn't an inspired student. He still had to work on a relative's farm to pay for his tuition and found the more work he did the less help he got from his relatives. He still had to go back to the family farm and help his father whenever he had spare time. He was almost too busy to worry too much about schoolThe first pivotal moment for Stoner is when he is sitting in an English class taught by his future mentor. The professor puts him on the spot asking him to explain a Shakespeare Sonnet. Stoner was dumbfounded not only with embarrassment, but by the language of the English bard. He switched majors from the department of agriculture to the department of English literature. I grew up on a farm about 80 years after Stoner, as anticipated by Stoner's father, production agriculture took great leaps forward replacing a lot of backbreaking labor with machines. Farmers were able to increase their land holdings as tractors and thrashers allowed them to maximize daylight hours. I stacked a lot of hay, feed cattle in subzero weather, pulled calves (you've never been properly slimed until you've spent time up to your elbow in a cow's uterus.), fixed fence, rode tractors listening to Royals baseball games to keep from dozing off, drove trucks full of grain, and every minute I wasn't doing something for the farm or playing sports I was reading books. My parents don't know how it happened. It must have been an aberrant gene. Nobody I knew read books, except for the good book, which most of the time I couldn't tell they'd grasped many of the concepts of that book either. The 1980s farm crises hit just as I was coming of age. Land values had jumped up and many farmers had expanded their operations. Then land values plummeted and bankers started realizing that the loans they had made to these farmers were no longer secured with enough equity. They started calling their customer's notes due. Thousands of farmers were forced to sell out. My Dad survived by the skin of his teeth. He decided there was no future in farming and told me I was going to college. My younger brother was a better fit for farming anyway. My Dad knew that I wasn't really cut out to be a farmer (my nose in a book all the time might have been the tip-off). A crises for many created an opportunity for me. Like Stoner I majored in English Literature. Stoner becomes a teacher. He decides not to go to war with his friends and suffers from the stigma of swimming against the tide. This is a theme for Stoner, going his own way, ignoring the odd looks, and the snide remarks. He meets a demure young woman named Edith and pursues her doggedly believing that his kindness would be recognized and appreciated by someone so fragile. The description of the consummation of the marriage is one of the grimmest most agonizing that I have ever read. \"Edith was in bed with the covers pulled to her chin, her face turned upward, her eyes closed, a thin frown creasing her forehead. Silently, as if she were asleep, Stoner undressed and got into bed beside her. For several moments he lay with his desire, which had become an impersonal thing, belonging to himself alone. He spoke to Edith, as if to find a haven for what he felt; she did not answer. he put his hand upon her and felt beneath the thin cloth of her nightgown the flesh he had longed for. He moved his hand upon her; she did not stir; her frown deepened. Again he spoke, saying her name to silence; then he moved his body upon her, gentle in his clumsiness. When he touched the softness of her thighs she turned her head sharply away and lifted her arm to cover her eyes. She made no sound.\"For a man so sensual and in need of romantic love he unfortunately married the wrong woman. He hoped for a partner, but found himself roped to a woman that embraced invalidism and waged nasty little wars against him that by his nature made him incapable of defending himself. He finds solace in books and spends more and more of his time at the University in Jesse Hall reading. \nJesse Hall at the University of MissouriStoner makes enemies of some of his coworkers. He is so unsuited for office politics that it proves to be a detriment to him. Though I was so proud of him towards the end of the book when he cleverly outflanks a department chair intent on driving him from the profession. He meets a woman, a very special woman as if molded by the gods to be the perfect mate for him. Her name is Katherine Driscoll and the gymnastics involved with the misinterpretations, missteps and miscues of their burgeoning relationship left me emotionally drained. There are movies sometimes or television shows where the audience is on the edge of their seat waiting for the moment when the characters finally realize they are meant to be together and kiss for the first time. Well it wasn't a kiss that became that epic moment for William and Katherine. \"He found himself trembling; as awkwardly as a boy he went around the coffee table and sat beside her. Tentatively, clumsily, their hands went out to each other; they clasped each other in an awkward, strained embrace; and for a long time they sat together without moving, as if any movement might let escape from them the strange and terrible thing that they held between them in a single grasp.\"Stoner's enemies leap at an opportunity to destroy him. Even the liberal community of a university has it's limits. Stoner for the first time in his life is becoming the person he always wanted to be, but the heady days of joy are under assault, and he is trapped by his own sense of honor. He suffers for love just as he is starting to understand it.\"In this forty-third year William Stoner learned what others much younger, had learned before him: that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another.\"This is such a deceptively simple novel. The sparse, powerful prose give this book so much depth. Stoner gets under your skin. He is so stoic in the face of continued and unremitting harassment from the people around him that I found myself sharing the pain with him. The author John Williams grew up on a small farm in Texas and had a similar escape to the University as Stoner and I. He ended up developing the writing program for the University of Denver. In the introduction by John McGahern he relates something that Mr. Williams said that resonates with me as well. Williams complains about the changes in the teaching of literature and the attitude to the text \"as if a novel or poem is something to be studied and understood rather than experienced.\"\nJohn WilliamsI'm a reader that likes to be told a story. I don't want to break books down to their mathematical or scientific structures. I want the mysticism, the emotion of a journey that expands my understanding of humanity. William Stoner is as real to me as the mailman that delivers my mail or the publisher that signs my checks. If I ever run into him I will shake his large, farm hardened hand and ask him if he has a little bit of time to talk to me about a certain sonnet written by a man by the name of Shakespeare."}, {"userName": "Jimmy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy", "userReview": "Spoiler alert: read at your own peril.UPDATE December 2010:I just submitted this to Better Book Titles. I hope they accept it.Original Review October 2009:This is the most straight-forward linear narrative type of novel I've read in the past year. So at first, I was not impressed. But I soon realized that the novel is impressive precisely because it is able to be so damn linear, the writing style so damn plain, and the characters so damn dull and yet... and yet it manages to make me continue reading on, driven by what I don't know. There is a constant melancholy through the book, but also its points of light.So that was the first 100 pages or so. Then it gets good. I mean, really good. But I don't know why. Nothing that much changes, it is just events in the life of this guy. But I start to really care about him, or really understand him... or something. Let me just put it out there: this is a depressing novel. It is a devastating novel. It made me cry. But it is not one where horrible thing after horrible thing happens to good people. Many of the things that happen are... yes, horrible, but also very normal... they are more like small dissappointments.John Williams is able to kill you softly with his immovable patience, his prose which is like the most patient thing in the world, and which builds and builds by inching closer and closer to the precipice. Precisely because he is not flashy. Precisely because he is so restrained in his prose, that you never realize it when you're right on the edge of the cliff and you're like \"wait, how did I get here?\"Also: I don't mean to suggest that his prose is boring. His prose is beautiful. But straight forward. And very functional. It is in service to the subject matter. And the fact that it is not flashy 95% of the time makes it all the more devastating the other 5% of the time, when he floors it as in this passage:\"Years later it was to occur to him that in that hour and a half on that December evening of their first extended time together, she told him more about herself than she ever told him again. And when it was over, he felt that they were strangers in a way that he had not thought they would be, and he knew that he was in love.\" p53or in this passage:\"It was a passion neither of the mind nor of the flesh; rather, it was a force that comprehended them both, as if they were but the matter of love, its specific substance. To a woman or to a poem, it said simply: Look! I am alive.\" p 250I've rambled long enough. Let me just say a few more things, because I'm a bit delirious. The characters. They are complex and blameless. That is part of the devastation. You can't blame them for the decisions they make. Each one, even the ones that make our protagonist's life hell, you can't blame them because the writer makes you understand (slowly) why they are the way they are. What drives each character to drive each other mad. I read on one of these goodreads reviews someone said \"It only troubles me that every single thing that Stoner thinks and says and does seems so incredibly right, or at least perfectly understandable, on first reading.\" That's what I mean. He didn't do anything wrong. Everything he does is understandable. He was just being himself the best way he knew how. And so was every character in this book."}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "THIS WAS MY BEST BOOK OF 2016!\nIt was a hard decision; it was a choice between this and  The Vegetarian by Hang Kang. But I had to think which book taught be the most, and which book helped me the most. I enjoyed them both immensely, I loved them, but this one set me on my path in life; thus, I will always be grateful for John Williams and his Stoner. ******************************************************\nHe opened the book; and as he did so it became not his own. He let his fingers rifle through the pages and felt a tingling, as if those pages were alive. The tingling came through his fingers and coursed through his flesh and bone; he was minutely aware of it, and he waited till it contained him, until the old excitement that was like horror fixed him where he lay\u2026\u2026\nWilliam Stoner has a terrible life: his marriage is a disaster; his daughter resembles her damaged mother; his teaching career is hindered by an argument with a fellow faculty member, and he is subjected to continual waves of misery. All in all, it\u2019s a sad life: it\u2019s his life. However, through all the shit times, and the occasional glimpses of happiness, one thing keeps him animated; it\u2019s a thing every reader knows: a love of words, a love of books and a love of the wonderment of literature. I will never forget the journey I shared with Stoner in these pages. He is a flawed man. When he was a student he had no real ambition or drive. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted to do, but he knew what he didn\u2019t want to do: he didn\u2019t want to be a farmer like his farther. A university lecture inspired him with the marvels of Shakespeare; he asked him a question, a question that changed Stoner\u2019s life. The result was a switch in academic discipline and an enthusiastic perusal of everything literature based. Stoner became engrossed with his work; he quickly forgot about the outside world, and refused to take part in the war effort. This is a feeling I know all too well. When one is completely engrossed in reading, obsessed even, it becomes difficult to pay attention to reality. If you\u2019ve made it this far into my review, then I probably don\u2019t need to tell you that. Stoner had what he needed: he had his books. But, life isn\u2019t always that simple.  \u201cHe had come to that moment in his age when there occurred to him, with increasing intensity, a question of such overwhelming simplicity that he had no means to face it. He found himself wondering if his life were worth the living; if it had ever been.\u201d A profound question to ask oneself, and I truly think this helped to consolidate his decisions. Student life comes to an end for most folk. For Stoner there is no end. University is his home; it is his life; it is his passion and his drive: it is the one and only constant in his existence. So why would he ever leave it? Why would he ever give it up? The student becomes the teacher, and Stoner extends his stay for a lifetime. He has nothing else to cling to, only a love for his field of scholarship. I cannot quite express how much I sympathise with this character here. As a student of literature, and a huge hobby reader, sometimes there seems to be little else on the horizon but to peruse one\u2019s passion. For Stoner though, his choice was the only one he could ever have made. His existence is only really for one purpose, and because of this he realised very early on his consequential fate.  \u201cIt\u2019s like it just all goes around and around and keeps on going. It makes you wonder.\u201d As Stoner gets older his peers begin to die. In this he sees what awaits him; he has the stark realisation that he, too, will die. This may seem trivial and an obvious fact of life, though a realisation of such magnitude can really alter character. Stoner has a midlife crises; he has a glimpse of what his life could have been like had he married his soul mate: his love and intellectual equal. It is a shame for Stoner that such a thing came when he was already settled, but, again, that\u2019s just life. This problematic relationship sets him even further on his course. I don\u2019t need to tell you about the ending. It is an obvious conclusion for such a book, though I will say that its delivery was nothing short of perfection. Never before have I read a book in which the entire thing is embodied in its final few words. I\u2019m amazed. I\u2019m shaken. I\u2019m stunned. I\u2019m numb. >Why you should read this: I don\u2019t often go as far as to explicitly state something like this in a review. Reading is personal and subjective. My reviews are just my opinion; they may not be shared by others. With this, however, I would go as far to say that this \nshould\n be read by every reader, every reader who has felt the sharp pangs that literature can evoke. Here is a man who is completely lost; here is a character that has nothing really to live for: here is a man who is lost in the words, and it\u2019s his salvation. And this is his life story. This is not a simple novel. It is a bildungsroman that is tragic, emotive and even inspiring. This book opened my eyes to many things. I learnt a great deal about life and myself in the process. Trust me, fellow bibliophiles, go read it.

Instead, I am going to confess that I read only half of it (and, thereby, my ignorance has been properly disclaimed) but that this aborted reading filled me with such unmitigated contempt for the author that I plan on mounting every soapbox (if soapboxes haven't been technologically obviated by now) from here to the Great Barrier Reef condemning this plodding, tiresome, amateurish book with an antagonistic passion that literature hasn't evoked in me since Cambridge's A Concise History of France (wherein concision meant excising significant historical events in favor of agricultural data and a dimly Marxist perspective, but I digress -- as always).I shouldn't blame John Williams for my rising blood pressure because in fact YOU are to blame. Yes, you. Perhaps not individually, but in the general sense of Goodreads voters and reviewers, of which you are presumably a constituent. As of this moment, Stoner has an average rating of 4.39 stars out of five on the basis of 531 Goodreader ratings. This is a remarkable score, to be sure, but as with many averages, it is complete and utter bullshit -- obviously contaminated by the spurious opinions of the ardent fans of graceless, tedious prose. You know who you are.Let's parse the data, shall we? 459 people gave this turd four or five stars; whilst only eleven people were courageous enough to call a spade a spade and, against the grain of general opinion, to award it only one or two stars. I consider these eleven people heroes. You and your ilk can eulogize the armed forces, the pigs, the schlubby, mustachioed rescue workers, with your tearful montages of wars, standoffs, and celebrity house fires, all assembled to the reactionary tunes of 3 Doors Down or Nickelback; I prefer a subtler form of heroism -- you know, the lone voice who amid the Russophilic, ostentatiously intellectual acclaim for Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita dares to raise an eyebrow at this dry Goethe wannabe...I therefore am a great hero because, fighting the insidious cabal of 'respectable' opinion, I offer my head to the rabble in order to warn you what a lifeless stinkbomb Stoner is. John Williams, I suspect, was an author who was better suited to actuarial work or fumigating. Something more prosaic. His main problem is that he wants desperately to tell you everything. He's adamant that you know this or that about his main character William Stoner's psychological make-up, habits, and proclivities, but unfortunately he'd rather put Mr. Stoner behind a glass wall at the zoo and recite a bunch of vague adjectives and banal activities relevant to him. In placing Stoner in the zoo and preparing a dry summation about him, he deprives Stoner of life, abbreviates him into a concept...This is one of the worst kind of all writers, in my opinion. He's committed to telling us and not to showing us. He wants to control your attitude toward the characters by completely demystifying them. Williams lays everything on the table, as if he's handing you a psychological abstract. More than a few times, I wished that John Williams were not dead and were ready-at-hand, so I could give him a chocolate swirlie. And then I pulled back in my condemnation for a moment... I rethought my rage... There are literally jillions of shitty writers on this planet, and a not-insignificant number have had their works published. Why should I blame John Williams for having a dream -- a grand ambition? I wish for nothing less myself. The intended repository for my rage and general ill-will should be those who have applauded this crapfest -- the ones who've elevated it to the status of minor classic of 20th century American literature. The straw which broke the etc. came midway through the book when Stoner's wife, until then a mousy, retiring, sickly sort, adopts a new attitude after the death of her father. She bobs her hair (it's the 1920s) and throws out her old clothes and buys some of those shapeless flapper-type shifts, and -- more consequentially -- she declares war on her husband. The psychology might as well be written in neon. She resents the dull (and not very affluent) academic life her husband provides. The switch is so abrupt and ridiculous that all of the author's explanations and expositions do nothing to make it palatable, even in his stubbornly distanced and abstract telling.

If you take a good look at this painting and then envision a son, an only child, working the fields alongside his father, you will have a clear image of the starting point of Stoner, John Williams\u2019 classic novel of quiet perfection.The novel follows the life of William Stoner from his boyhood on a Missouri farm though his years as a faculty member of the English Department at the University of Missouri. William Stoner is a good man, a man of integrity, a man, as we eventually find out through his relationship with a fellow faculty member, Katherine Driscoll, capable of profound intimacy and tenderness of heart. William Stoner is also a lover of literature, an accomplished scholar and a dedicated teacher.But all is not well in the life of Professor Stoner, particularly in his home life. As a beginning instructor right out of graduate school, he marries a woman barely twenty years of age from St. Louis, the daughter of a banker, a young woman by the name of Edith Elaine Bostwick. Turns out, young Edith is what we term nowadays as emotionally abused. And right from the start of her marriage, Edith inflicts emotional abuse on her husband Stoner and eventually on their daughter Grace. Personally, I found reading those parts of the novel involving Edith particularly wrenching bordering on painful.Indeed, as readers we live through the pain of Stoner dealing with Edith\u2019s wall of emotional frigidness and coldness, which includes being relegated as a husband in his late twenties to sleeping on the parlor coach at night. Through all the years of isolation and alienation, including Edith\u2019s wedging a wall of separation between Stoner and Grace, there is one particularly poignant scene where we read, \u201cOnce, while Edith was upstairs, William and his daughter passed each other in the living room. Grace smiled shyly at him, and involuntarily he knelt on the floor and embraced her. He felt her body stiffen, and he saw her face go bewildered and afraid. He raised himself gently away from her, said something inconsequential, and retreated to his study.\u201d For a child to become bewildered and afraid when a parent expresses such tenderness and affection speaks volumes to the level of emotional abuse at home.Rather than dwelling on the grimness of Stoner\u2019s family life, I will conclude with a one final observation: Grace gives birth to a baby boy but after one brief visit did not return to the home of her parents with her son since, as Stoner realizes on his own and Grace tells him in so many words at one point during her whiskey drinking (and, yes, a grim fact: she has turned to alcohol), she got pregnant in the first place to escape from the prison of his mother\u2019s presence. Well, my goodness \u2013 as readers we have a good idea what it would mean for a sensitive man like William Stoner to be deprived of a relationship with his grandson.Turning to Stoner\u2019s professional life, there are serious cracks within the halls of academe. He is a man of integrity and honesty and the political infighting within academic departments is famous for being vicious and nasty. I wouldn\u2019t want to say any more so as to spoil for a reader, but I can assure you Dr. Stoner is on the receiving end of a large dose of viciousness.But through it all, our main character remains strong. One memorable paragraph from the novel: \u201cBut William Stoner knew of the world in a way that few of his younger colleagues could understand. Deep in him, beneath his memory, was the knowledge of hardship and hunger and endurance and pain. Though he seldom thought of his early years on the Booneville farm, there was always near his consciousness the blood knowledge of his inheritance, given him by forefathers whose lives were obscure and hard and stoical and whose common ethic was to present to an oppressive world faces that were expressionless and hard and bleak.\u201dIncidentally, when I was a 12 year old boy I joined me father, mother and sister as we took a trip in our car from the New Jersey shore across the American Midwestern heartland of farms to pay a visit to my grandmother. On the way out and also in my grandmother\u2019s town, I heard a number of harrowing tales of farm life, especially for the children of farmers. I reflected on those tales of physical hardship and unending toil when I wrote this surreal micro-fiction a number of years ago:DOWN ON THE FARMBefore he leaves the city they tell him how the country doctor drives a buggy made from the flesh and bones of his former patients.\u201cNothing goes to waste,\u201d is the way they put it when he finally arrives, \u201cwe\u2019re all farmers around here.\u201dHe joins the doctor on his first visit to a farmhouse to attend a sick woman. Instead of a thermometer, the doctor sticks his middle finger under the woman\u2019s tongue and says, \u201cI\u2019ve done this enough times to know when someone has a fever.\u201dHe looks over the doctor\u2019s shoulder out the farmhouse window. Beyond a skeleton tied to a pole, he sees the farmer plowing his field using his younger son harnessed as a beast of burden.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that take superhuman strength?\u201d he asks the doctor.The doctor answers, \u201cHis older son wasn\u2019t quite as strong, but still makes a fine scarecrow.\u201dAmerican author John William (1922-1994)"}, {"userName": "Rinda Elwakil ",

I've never read anything like it and some passages left me moved to the point of exhaustion. When I finished I put down the book (well, the Nook), picked it up again, and re-read highlighted pages. Stoner gave me strength; if you believe that the right books find you at the right time, as sometimes I believe, this book found me at the right time.Stoner outlines the life of a farm kid who, at his dad's recommendation, attends college for agricultural studies but switches to literature and becomes a low-level university faculty member for most of his career. He marries an affluent city girl, starts teaching, and loves his daughter. His marriage begins to crumble and he starts an affair with a student. He runs afoul of university politics and lands an insulting teaching schedule. Williams manages, with breathtaking grace, to create complex, nuanced characters through lean, careful sentences. He'll pass years with a few heartbreaking paragraphs and allow the reader to generate what's between the lines. Stoner is like a Rothko painting put to words; empty blotches, perhaps, at first glance, but sublime, minimalist depth with time and attention. Characters change, but not all the way, then change back again, and, if a happy ending emerges, it's a still, sublime happiness. I'm a teacher so I was, of course, overlaying my own background on the text while reading. But I think I would have appreciated Stoner anyway. The novel's power rises from its quiet, subtle movement. An excellent introduction (I don't think I've ever said that before...most introductions are stupid) in the NYRB edition includes a rate Williams interview in which the author describes the main character as heroic for, essentially, sticking to his own values and doing the best he can. What might appear as small failures are potentially victories in the context of Stoner's values (which, in other characters' eyes, sometimes appear as stubbornness). And even if you can't control every element of your environment, the politics at your job, how the people you love respond to challenges, and other variables across the multitudes of contexts, you can respond with grace and dignity. And when, nearing death, he experiences this:A sense of his own identity came upon him with a sudden force, and he felt the power of it. He was himself, and he knew what he had beenI wanted to raise my fists in the air and recognize all of the invisible punk rock people living quietly, without affectation, holding as true as possible to their cores in the face of unrelenting messages that there is something wrong with them and they should feel other than they do and be other than what they are. Stoner is amazing. You might not like it, I suppose, as some of my GR friends didn't. But even glancing through the text, searching out quotes, makes me feel more alive. For me, Stoner is one of those books. Thank you, Mr. Williams. You made my weekend. And beyond.P.S. In some of the book's NYRB promotional materials Tom Hanks praises Stoner. I swear, Mr. Hanks, if you turn this novel into a movie, I will beat your ass. At least on the internet. I'm afraid you'll include scenes in which you're standing on a leaf-blown quad, deep in thought, staring into the sky, while treacly strings play in the background and the camera pans high and away. Don't fucking ruin this novel, Mr. Hanks. I'm warning you."}, {"userName": "Orsodimondo", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10490224-orsodimondo", "userReview": "UN DIFETTO DI LUCE** Shakespeare le parla attraverso tre secoli di storia, Mr Stoner. Riesce a sentirlo?... Cosa le sta dicendo, Mr Stoner? Cosa significa questo sonetto?Stoner alz\u00f2 lo sguardo con lentezza, riluttante. \"Significa\", disse\u2026 \"Significa\", ripet\u00e9, e non riusc\u00ec a terminare la frase.William Stoner era all\u2019universit\u00e0 per studiare agraria e tornare in campagna ad aiutare suo padre nei campi e, magari, grazie allo studio, riuscire a far rendere meglio la terra avara. Un sonetto di Shakespeare lo folgora, come san Paolo sulla via di Damasco. Un\u2019autentica epifania. Ed \u00e8 l\u2019inizio di una vita nuova: basta con l\u2019agricoltura, la letteratura e la lingua diventano la passione che lo accompagna fino alla fine.Norman RockwellIn realt\u00e0, di Stoner occorre dire qualcos\u2019altro, di ben diverso. Ma questa parte, all\u2019inizio del libro, ho dovuto sottolinearla, perch\u00e9 io di fronte a questo libro sono rimasto letteralmente folgorato, senza parole, con tante lacrime, ma nessuna parola \u2013 e solo una \u00e8 emersa dalla nebbia umida, Significa, appunto, proprio questa. Che per me vuol dire, \u00e8 bello, \u00e8 bellissimo, questo libro \u00e8 magnifico.Yann KebbiChi \u00e8 William Stoner? Un uomo senza qualit\u00e0, viene da pensare, un mediocre. Eppure, \u00e8 pieno di qualit\u00e0: \u00e8 un uomo gentile, che conosce la Bellezza; ha un tenero rapporto con sua figlia, conosce l\u2019amore pi\u00f9 appassionato (ma esiste una storia d\u2019amore pi\u00f9 avvincente nella storia della letteratura?); non prova odio, n\u00e9 risentimento, n\u00e9 violenza; nutre una passione sempiterna per la letteratura e la lingua inglese.Per\u00f2: accetta, non si ribella, non dice, no, questo no, non lo far\u00f2, subisce, \u00e8 passivo, inerme, si rassegna, si adatta - si sente fallito, e la sua vita brilla proprio come il perfetto fallimento di un\u2019esistenza che a parte qualche settimana, qualche breve mese, \u00e8 trascorsa in solitudine. Stoner muore sostanzialmente solo: e questo credo sia il suo pi\u00f9 vero fallimento (ma esiste una morte pi\u00f9 trasparente di quella di Stoner nella storia della letteratura?).Edward Hopper Eppure Stoner \u00e8 un uomo con principi, con idee, mantiene la sua passione per la letteratura, non \u00e8 infelice, \u00e8 tutto meno che una pietra: \u00e8 come se non fosse davvero tangibile, come se fosse su un\u2019altra dimensione, straniero a casa sua.Una vita minima: dopo l\u2019incipit viene da dire, no, basta, come si pu\u00f2 riempire trecento pagine sulla vita di quest\u2019uomo cos\u00ec insulso? Io non voglio essere lui, e per lui non ho interesse.Ma ci vuole pochissimo per sentire che siamo in presenza della verit\u00e0 umana, come succede nella grande letteratura, che si tratta di una fuga nella vita.Roberta Montaruli alias K.D In qualche strano modo, durante la lettura, ho sentito Flaubert vicino, pi\u00f9 di John Williams, che non conoscevo affatto. E proprio come Flaubert con la sua Madame Bovary, mi viene da dire, Stoner sono io.Scrittura bisbigliata, lineare, semplice, chiara, limpida, trasparente come una superficie di vetro, si vede attraverso, si capisce...Un piccolo miracolo, che illumina: proprio come Stoner rimase illuminato dal sonetto 73 di Shakespeare.**Un difetto di luce, o meglio, A Flaw of Light, era il titolo originale di questo romanzo quando Williams lo consegn\u00f2 alla sua agente, Marie Rodell. Fu la casa editrice Viking, dopo infiniti rifiuti, a pubblicarlo cambiando il titolo.97 likesEd ecco Stoner: sar\u00e0 Casey Affleck a interpretarlo. Joe Wright a dirigere il film, regista dal quale purtroppo non c\u2019\u00e8 da aspettarsi granch\u00e9."}, {"userName": "Helen \u03a1\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af

"userReview": "Devastating novel of academia, unfulfilled hope, and a life not-entirely-lived. Gorgeous writing, heartbreaking plot, and if you're a fan, as I tend to be, of stories set in the dark halls of libraries and universities, this is one to read. The love story within this book is suddenly out-of-nowhere rapturous, and the marriage is brittle, delicate, insensible and perfectly done. The book feels so modern, though the bulk of the action is set in the 30's and 40's. I kept stopping to check that this was true - the love affair, in particular, feels like something that might be happening this moment in an office at, say, Middlebury. Stoner's marriage, in contrast, is painfully frozen in time and in the cultural expectations of women in the early part of the last century, but even so, Stoner's wife's personality feels very real to me, and the way it is written about feels revolutionary. Speaking of revolutionary: I don't know why this book doesn't stand with, say, Revolutionary Road, as a massive classic. By the end, I was holding a hand over my mouth, because I kept moaning in sympathy for poor Stoner. I never felt that way reading Yates - whose characters, though foiled totally by their self-involvement, seem somehow to deserve what they get. Reading this felt more like reading someone like Andre Dubus - full of people making destructive choices, but nevertheless, you feel for them, and feel their humanity the whole time you're reading."}, {"userName": "Samadrita", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita", "userReview": "\u201cMost men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.\u201d - Henry David Thoreau The triumph of this work lies in its self-effacing world-weariness, its tone of indifference even to the prospective reader's concerns. In the manner of the protagonist's iron stoicism in the face of misfortune and persecution, the narrative revels in its own lacklustreness, its state of diffused melancholy. William Stoner, first student and eventually English professor at (fictionalized) University of Missouri lives a life of flawed choices, unrealized potential and innumerable regrets, witnessing the world go through a period of tremendous sociopolitical ferment in the 20th century, and remaining invisible in the eyes of history. He breathes his last, just as silently, alone in a hospital ward, feebly flipping through the pages of a scholarly work. But do not for a moment think this deceptively drab synopsis encapsulates the essence of 'Stoner'. John Williams, through his luminous prose and a vision which is as solemn as it is lucid, reminds us of the quotidian battles fought every moment anywhere by faceless individuals against the forces of oppression and moral laxity - that the fate of civilization is dependent on the capable or incapable shoulders of an individual.\nHe found himself wondering if his life were worth the living; if it had ever been. It was a question, he suspected, that came to all men at one time or another; he wondered if it came to them with such impersonal force as it came to him. The question brought with it a sadness, but it was a general sadness which (he thought) had little to do with himself or with his particular fate; he was not even sure that the question sprang from the most immediate and obvious causes, from what his own life had become.\nA homage to the spirit of literature? Most certainly. A story recounted with conviction and a quiet dignity? Undoubtedly. A sincere attempt at proffering acknowledgment on a seemingly inconsequential existence? That too. But more than anything else this is a literary toast raised in honour of those small, often unnoticed, acts of courage and compassion which somehow realign the moral order of society but are blotted out from memory and consciousness easily.There is sadness here - boundless in depth and overwhelming in intensity - but hope glimmers occasionally too. Hope that even though the world may go to pieces and things may fall apart irrevocably, a man may summon the will to endure the tragedy of existence by discovering a true and unbreakable love. The currents of time weather away all past disappointments, bittersweet longing, old grudges and anger. Only the love of the written word casts a glow in the eternal darkness.\nA kind of joy came upon him, as if borne in on a summer breeze. He dimly recalled that he had been thinking of failure--as if it mattered. It seemed to him now that such thoughts were mean, unworthy of what his life had been. Dim presences gathered at the edge of his consciousness; he could not see them, but he knew that they were there, gathering their forces toward a kind of palpability he could not see or hear. He was approaching them, he knew; but there was no need to hurry. He could ignore them if he wished; he had all the time there was."}, {"userName": "Camille Stein", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19308897-camille-stein", "userReview": "The Thinker: Portrait of Louis N.

A sling, a pond, a pebble, a mica chip; they would catch my attention and hold it hostage. I would play for hours together with these silent, placid beings, drawing great solace from their harmless, non-fluctuating colour, and intention. Occasionally, a friend or two would drop in and ask in mock incredulity, \u2018Don\u2019t you ever get tired playing with them? They neither move nor speak.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t answer. Only under my breath, after their departure, would pass a smile of assurance and utter, \u2018They do.\u2019In the moments that saw me reading the last few pages of this book, that old vision made its presence felt; much like a feather that comes flying from nowhere and perches on the evening window sill. The transient nature of the vision notwithstanding, it niftily metamorphosed into something beautiful, and imperfect. \n\u2019You, too, are cut out for failure; not that you'd fight the world. You'd let it chew you up and spit you out, and you'd lie there wondering what was wrong. Because you'd always expect the world to be something it wasn't, something it had no wish to be. The weevil in the cotton, the worm in the beanstalk, the borer in the corn. You couldn't face them, and you couldn't fight them; because you're too weak, and you're too strong. And you have no place to go in the world.'\n So says one of Stoner\u2019s best friends about him; early in the book. And I know he was right. Even when I hovered at the page enlisting the timid yet enthusiastic advance of a teen Stoner into his graduate class, I knew his friend was right. And as I followed Stoner\u2019s journey from a farmer to a student to a professor, I held on to that opinion. Even as he fell in love and remained devoid of absorbing its vibrant colours, I nodded in affirmation. And as he discovered love, in its pristine bounty and lost it, and found it again, I smiled at the accurate assessment of his friend. But Stoner remained blissfully oblivious to the chequered opinions more out of a natural propensity than a measured effort.Stoner was not a hero. No, he was not. From whichever significant angle I viewed him, he fell short - as a son, as a husband, as a father, as a teacher, as a lover and regretfully, even as a friend, he stumbled upon the table of traits that he should have stood firmly upon. As a result, I never saw him.But it was his shadows that I followed. The inanimate yet exploring shadow. The inanimate yet expressing shadow. In his insignificant existence, lied his great sacrifices. In his ephemeral dreams, lied his indelible marks. In his fractured words, lied his myriad kindness. In his worldly failures, lied his biggest strengths. When many thin-skinned shadows come together, they fuse to emerge a unique sheet of latent power; an intimidating solitary force, as much capable of usurping a dazzling life as protecting a blemished one. That Stoner chose to channelize his many shadows to do the latter, over a life spanning sixty-five years, with implausible consistency that defied age, is what makes him a hero. And such heroes earn an honorary mention in the book of life under the page that highlights the bravehearts who led their lives like the humble, fecund soil over which the saplings of others\u2019 lives found their robust roots.You know a Stoner. But his undeserved obscurity is huddled under numerous shadows. Strip them if you can. There will be resistance. But in the angst of those shadows, lies the petals of life; someday you should pause and feel its textures. The fragrance is bound to stick to your fingers, long after you have forged ahead on your chosen path.----\nAlso on my blog."}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "This might be for me the best book of the year.Sublimely told and with such a subtle narrative which flows easily displaying the life of an ordinary man during an extraordinary time in America. This might be the story of a whole becoming country or only the unheroic account of a simple existence.But its simplicity is what makes it unearthly beautiful, nostalgic and moving.Early 1900's, Missouri, although Stoner comes from a modest family of farmers his father sends him to the state university to study agronomy. But he falls in love with English literature instead and thanks to a particular professor he becomes a teacher himself, growing estranged from his family in the process.We follow his life through 40 years of teaching, of crushed illusions and bitter disappointments about his failure of a marriage to the wrong woman, of rare fleeting blissful moments in a rather bleak existence in solitude, of a life dedicated to teaching where he finds his only solace.I found that as the years passed by, the voice in the novel gained in strength and that Stoner became the person he was always supposed to be. His seemingly detached account of the years between the two great world wars, his increasing estrangement first from his family and later from his own wife and daughter, his struggle for an idealistic conception of what university teachers should be like... all these issues cause great suffering to this man, who, without doing much in his life or maybe doing more than most, bears a stoic testimony of a past time which created the basis of what we are now.I closed the last pages of the book with my eyes completely blurred and with such constrained emotion in my chest that it was almost painful.A masterpiece not appreciated as it would deserve, maybe because this book reads like real life instead of a best-seller-hero-with a-happy-ending story.Can't say how good this novel is, just pick it up and read it."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa", "userReview": "\"Look! I am alive!\"Being alive, and feeling it, is more important than striving for perfect happiness, which is an illusion in any case, - that is what Stoner seems to say over the course of his life. And reading his story made me acutely aware of being alive myself, going through the range of emotions it inspired in me, from sadness and anger over tenderness and love to deeply felt satisfaction when I closed the novel.Stoner is Don Quixote stuck in reality.He has the same love of reading and learning, the same voracious hunger for literature. He is driven by the same pure and honest, but also a bit foolish literary idealism, and dares to give up his family's agricultural life to set out on an adventure in the unknown world of books. Being a novice in the complicated university cosmos, he faces more challenges than most, without a supportive network to fall back on. He is a knight on his own, in uncharted territory, like Don Quixote.But unlike Don Quixote, he recognises all the windmills standing in his way as windmills, and does not take them for fairy tale dragons. His ability to see what the world is like does not make him a coward, though. He speaks up against a powerful colleague, protecting academic integrity and honesty when he sees it undermined by personal interest, incompetence and emotional blackmail. He accepts the consequences of his outspoken protest, but doesn't fear a new battle either, once he sees an opportunity to fight the Evil Dragon of Bad Scheduling (as each Valiant Knight of the Order of Perfect Education knows, there is nothing like the passive-aggressive power to give the enemy a really bad schedule!). Stoner knows better than Don Quixote to bide his time and wait for an opportune moment. He also knows which weapons to use against the Wizard of Academia. To fight a Jabberwocky, you need a vorpal sword.Stoner sees his own Dulcinea for what she is as well. After an initial confused courtship, and a premature marriage based on vague romantic feelings, he acknowledges the ugly truth about mainstream, middle class, failed marriage. Instead of becoming bitter, however, he dares to engage wholeheartedly in a connection with a soulmate for a while, knowing full well that the \"lust and learning\" they share and live for will not be a permanent commitment.Why not? Why not act out foolish heroism and run away with his lover? His wife is happier when he is not in the house, and she obsessively shields her daughter from him, so why not break out and live outside the narrow-minded conventions and facades of middle class morality and bigotry? Why? Because Stoner is a realist. Eloping with his princess would have meant for both of them to change their lives to the point of giving up their most cherished asset, the reason for their mutual attraction and respect: their teaching and living for learning. They would have become different persons, and their love would not have stayed the same. They feel grateful for the time they shared, for the chance to unite in a perfect intellectual and intensely sexual relationship. Divorce, escape and remarriage would not have given them a \"happy ending\". Only hopeless romantics can wish for Stoner and Katherine to give up themselves instead of cultivating a perfect memory. They opt for a temporary, but true, concrete, physical love affair rather than for moping after imaginary Dulcineas.Stoner even has his own faithful Sancho Pansa in his old classmate Gordon Finch, who constitutes a vital link to the world, being a down-to-earth pragmatic, humorous anti-hero who helps Stoner organise the worldly matters of university life.Many reviews focus on Stoner's stoicism, his passive acceptance of hardship without display of feelings or complaint. I can understand where that is coming from, but I see more of a rebel in him myself, within a realistic framework. He sticks to his vision of life, against the manipulation and conventional pettiness of career socialites. He defies the norms of his environment without acting out the dramatic plot of a thriller. In real life, most people do not turn into social revolutionaries, or outcasts. Ordinary life does not contain murder cases, complex global conspiracies and drastic plots and showdowns. Stoner's story is firmly rooted in university life's reality, not in Hollywood.Life is about playing the cards you are dealt, carefully choosing the right ones at the right moment. Stoner plays his hand, and he resists the authority of his monotonous agricultural background, his professional opponents, his estranged wife, and keeps playing his own game. He is lucky to know what he plays for: \"Lust and learning!\"And he is lucky to be able to see the short moments of happiness and be grateful for them, instead of ambitiously pushing for unrealistic goals by fighting windmills to keep up the appearance of importance and vain actionism.Stoner is in love with teaching, and maybe that is too absurd to be taken seriously if you have not felt the same yourself. Maybe only those who have fought the windmills of educational institutions, and tried to leave, only to be driven back by that unreasonable passion - maybe only those are able to see a good life in Stoner's path. \"Thank you for letting me teach\", he says when he retires. Whoever knows how lost one can get in the administrative treadmills of education systems, knows the value of being allowed \"to teach\". Stoner bravely faces the ridicule of others, accepting as a minor pain that being \"a dedicated teacher\" is something colleagues smile at and joke about. It is not the norm at all, rather a strange quixotic rebellion against the mainstream career.To me, Stoner is an everyday hero, a man who dies content, without regrets - as opposed to Don Quixote, who was influenced by the nonsense of conventional dogma in the end and stopped believing in himself, thus rejecting his own idealism and life style on his death bed. Burning your dreams, or dying with a book between your weak fingers, that's the question. Stoner dies surrounded by his books. \"He let his fingers riffle through the pages and felt a tingling, as if those pages were alive.\"Books are alive, and Stoner knows it. That is why his life - dedicated to learning, reading and sharing - is a perfect rebellion against the mediocre world he lives in. Stoner is Don Quixote navigating reality! Not happy - but ALIVE - until the very last moment!"}, {"userName": "Frona", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58118625-frona", "userReview": "The story evolves so gently and quietly that talking about it feels like tainting it and violently intruding on something that prefers to be left in peace. This has as much to do with the story\u2019s subtle and eluding tone, as with the parallel narrative. Stoner is a quiet and gentle men with the purest of intentions, but which, as it often happens, get tainted when materialized. His life advances in an isolated manner, devoid of the force that transforms a thought into action or the knowledge of how to use it.Stoner grows up on a farm and lacks the notions of the bigger world\u2019s complexities. When he, by coincidence, discovers literature and the academic world, the consequences are two-sided. Knowing hard work, he progress quickly. Lacking experience, he isn\u2019t able to connect his own life with this imaginary world and instead, separates them completely. Since the new world has nothing to do with the former one \u2013 it is exempt from monotonous, repetitive, manual work and is full of wonder, novelty and flights of thought \u2013 he finds in it a perfect hideaway. It is a place where the practical life can\u2019t intrude and the daily problems can\u2019t invade, but where the inputs still have straightforward outputs and things are as simple as they sometimes were. The worse his domestic life gets, the more he retreats to studies; the more he masters the written word, the less he can articulate his own everyday. The two worlds become so isolated that even a desperate cry for help from his nearest turns into a distant call from a faraway land. Despite all the theoretical knowledge, he doesn\u2019t have the tools to question and resist his own life course.This book is a monument to the mundane, to the paths we choose without really choosing, to the joys and sorrows that coincidences distribute unevenly among people, and of a life that has much more within its reach, yet stays motionless and trapped between opposing forces. With simple, but deeply moving sentences it portrays a correspondent story. As many monuments, it captures a moment of life and provides a humble warning for those who are inclined to follow his path."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3845138-carol", "userReview": "\u201cThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\u201d\u2015 Henry David Thoreau, I loved this novel! I\u2019ve had this story downloaded for some time but I\u2019ve always passed it over anticipating a dull and depressing slog\u2026in spite of all the glowing reviews from my Goodreader friends. But, it was as compelling for me to read as any thriller. .The critic Morris Dickstein called Stoner, \"something rarer than a great novel -- it is a perfect novel, so well told and beautifully written, so deeply moving, it takes your breath away.\u201d I could not agree more with Dickstein\u2019s account of this book. I was deeply moved by the story and I constantly rooted for this very gentle, introspective and solitary man throughout his futile attempts to achieve some sort of happiness, good fortune or pleasure\u2026anything\u2026please, god, help him out here! He deserved so much more than he ultimately received. And, when good things finally came his way, they were repeatedly transitory.Passive or non-assertive characters often frustrate me. Stoner never made me feel this way; mostly, because he seemed to navigate through so much adversity, disappointments and harassment without bitterness or blame. In fact, as the novel progresses, Stoner develops a greater strength of character and some sense of resignation about circumstances beyond his control even as his aloneness becomes more and more stark. I felt as though I actually knew this man. \u2013 it was such an intimate account of his life. The writing is remarkable - beautiful in its austerity, rich with a sense of place and period details of the early 20th century.

William Stoner was the only child at his family\u2019s farm in Missouri, with a work-to-play ratio that was high even by turn-of-the-last-century standards. When he came of age, his father sat him down and explained in about two minutes\u2019 time how he thought it best to send his son to college to study modern agriculture. It was the longest Stoner had ever heard his father speak in one stretch. Stoner continued to do farm work for room and board while going to classes. The Ag Sciences curriculum was all well and good, but in his sophomore year he was thrown for a loop in a required English class. The professor put him on the spot asking for his interpretation of a sonnet by Shakespeare, and suddenly his life that had been a matter of facts gave way to matters of opinion, feelings, and gray scales. He switched majors without counsel or delay. This was his awakening, though little of it showed. He was still something of a stoic -- compliant and resigned. He did manage to break from farm life, enter grad school in English (to ultimately become a professor), make a few friends and meet a girl he quickly asked to marry, but we were often told that he was an outside observer of his own life, like a character in a book he didn\u2019t write. I don\u2019t know if anyone else interprets Stoner this way, but he seemed to me to embody the reading experience itself -- the losing of one\u2019s self in the text and the passive acceptance that life\u2019s narratives play out according to some authorial design. Stoner steps outside of himself to observe from afar his bad marriage, the effects of academic politics badly played, and the fall-out when his wife used his relationship with their young daughter in an unaccountably nasty battle against him. It\u2019s frustrating to see how his inactions impinge on his happiness. But we also sense a richer inner life because of his books and his view of himself in light of them.The first quarter of the book was, to be honest, a little slow. Before Stoner\u2019s love affair with literature, he was a tabula rasa. That being the case, it was difficult at that stage to generate much conflict to drive the story. What would an internal struggle be against? Then, faintly at first, the tabula took on a few etch marks. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d describe Stoner as an everyman, but he was certainly a type of man -- the type who would find himself in circumstances he lacked the proactiveness to avoid. He\u2019d have been the prime example of how \nnot\n to do things in self-help books. He sucked at office politics (having taken what he thought to be a principled stand against another professor who soon became the department head), he wasn\u2019t particularly collegial, and he could scarcely sell his own enthusiasms. On the face of it, he was some combination of schlub, schlemiel, and schlimazel. A brief spell of passion was disallowed by the political environment, which I liken to a favorite book that simply ends\u2026 with no sequel forthcoming. He lacked what it took to write his own story.Williams, an academic himself, said in a rare interview that he never considered Stoner a loser. In fact, he regarded him as quietly heroic, doing his job with few people encouraging him or caring, true to his life of letters. Judging from the high ratings, plenty of other readers must have picked up on this narrow but deep fulfillment, too. We may not consider him the best model for self-actualization, but we appreciate his integrity. There was an affecting end to the book, too, which I don\u2019t want to spoil. The bottom line is this: if my theory about Stoner representing the reading experience is right, those of us who like reading will like Stoner. It\u2019s a syllogism, right? And even if we don\u2019t like the man, we can still like the book.Stoner gets the NYRB Seal of Approval and, for that matter, mine as well."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Ashleigh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33737465-jonathan-ashleigh", "userReview": "I would have never thought the bland life of an unfulfilled midwestern professor could be so grasping.

I have a small collection of their red-spined covers sitting on my shelves. They all have something in common apart from the red spines; they are books I may read again sometime in my life because of the quality of the writing, the depth of the characterisation and the overall worth of the contents. They are books that won\u2019t date and that I won\u2019t outgrow. A friend placed this Vintage book in my hands last week and said, you must read it and tell me what you think. I was curious as I\u2019d noticed that Stoner, though written decades ago, had been getting a lot of attention recently and was glad of the opportunity to read it at last. I put everything else aside and read the book over a short space of time, unusual for me as I often dip in and out of several books at the same time.My edition has an introduction by John McGahern. McGahern is a writer I respect a lot. I\u2019d love to see his books getting more attention; a re-release of McGahern's works would allow a new generation of readers to see how he evolved over time, how he kept rubbing away at a small number of themes until they were as smooth and perfect as a stone polished by the sea.Smooth but not flat.The word flat occurs to me because I found Williams' writing flat from the beginning, not flat as in spare or plain but flat as in lifeless. The early part is a familiar story, the boy from the farm goes to college and meets a teacher who helps him discover his life\u2019s passion. At that point, I thought: oh, wonderful, the author has been using a flat style in the early part so that he can provide a contrast in the section where his hero, William Stoner discovers the pleasures of literature. And yes, there is huge promise in the device the author uses of having his hero awaken via a Shakespeare sonnet. But, although Stoner goes on to read widely, eventually teaching in a college, his literary journey doesn\u2019t influence the language of the novel very much; there is no interplay between Williams\u2019 writing and Stoner\u2019s literary evolution. It is as if Williams set out to avoid literary resonances, in fact I found more biblical parallels than literary ones. But to continue with the literature issues, there are a few examples of Stoner\u2019s teaching skills inserted into the text, and though he does sound like a very dedicated teacher, the extracts from lectures and the questions he puts to a student relating to poetry didn't match with what we are told of Stoner's passion for literature. But I did find it interesting and clever that each time he gazed through a window, or better still, opened a window, the language soared and I was breathing in fresh air alongside the main character. What joy! The few times that happened, I silently willed Williams to keep the window open. But, except for some moving writing near the end, he preferred not to. John McGahern quotes John Williams in the introduction: when asked if literature is written to be entertaining, he answers, \u201cAbsolutely. My God, to read without joy is stupid\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t put it quite like that but there is truth in what Williams says. And a large part of the pleasure of reading comes from the quality of an author's writing. It\u2019s interesting to note that I\u2019ve struggled to write this review. I\u2019ve been asking myself why it is so difficult to write about Stoner and the answer may lie in Williams\u2019 own words: when reading is a joy, the response to it is effortless, the review tumbles out, inspired by the words we\u2019ve read. When there\u2019s no joy, making a response is an enormous effort. However, since I rarely have to make such an effort (as I usually find reading a joy), I\u2019ll challenge myself a little more.I\u2019ve concentrated on the writing because it\u2019s always more important for me than the plot but I do pay attention to how the plot and the characters are handled. Early in the novel, Williams decides to have Stoner choose a wife. So Stoner goes to a shop and sees one he likes and decides to buy her straight away. No. I\u2019m joking, of course. And can I point out here that there is absolutely no humour in this book so my joke is out of place. Except it isn\u2019t, because that\u2019s more or less the way Stoner picks his wife. He sees Edith once and decides to marry her. She has no say whatever and Williams even stresses her passive reluctance. So the business is conducted between the girl's father and the prospective son-in-law. But Williams doesn\u2019t plan on presenting this catalogue bride as a victim. Oh, no, the hero is the only victim in every episode of the long saga which is his life (I used the word 'hero' because Williams said in the interview quoted in the introduction that Stoner \u201cis a real hero\u201d).I mentioned biblical echoes earlier. Stoner is like a Job figure; every possible plague is thrown at him, and his enemies are horribly diabolical, but he endures all of his \u2018undeserved trials\u2019 with the utmost patience and rarely fights back. That would be fine if he alone were the victim. But he is not the only victim. Apart from his wife, whose character remains one-dimensional throughout and her extraordinary \u2018evil\u2019 nature unexplained, there is a daughter who becomes the true victim in the story. The author fails to underline that his hero never makes a real effort to save his daughter. I\u2019m not blaming him for allowing the daughter to be sacrificed but I am asking the author to be aware of his main character\u2019s failure to save her. It is never acknowledged. So how can he be a hero? Stoner also stands by when a young women he becomes involved with is sacked because of him. Although other reasons are given, the author implies that Stoner can't save her because he has to save his daughter instead. Except that he doesn't save his daughter.There were a few occasions when I wondered if Williams was really aware of what he was doing in this novel: the way he has Stoner choose his wife; the way he handles the daughter story; the loose ends that are scattered throughout and finally, the enemies he chooses for his 'hero' (apart from the \u2018evil\u2019 wife). The main enemy is a work colleague called Lomax. There are no reasons given for Lomax\u2019s unrelenting attacks upon Stoner. Both Lomax and the student he engages to help in the vicious attacks on Stoner, have physical disabilities, so one of the implications of their unexplained vendetta has to be jealousy of Stoner\u2019s physical strength. I found that disturbing. John McGahern, in the introduction, refrains from commenting on this aspect of the novel, simply stating that the portrait of Hollis Lomax is \u201cthe most complex\u201d in the entire book. McGahern doesn\u2019t really discuss the story in any depth. Instead, he writes an introduction that is little more than a summary as if Williams were an old friend for whom he was doing a favour.I mentioned loose ends or red herrings so I had better deal with them before I finish. Stoner refuses to join the army in 1917 when the United States declares war on Germany. His friends join up and one of them, Finch, accuses Stoner of letting everyone down. While we, the readers, might agree with Stoner\u2019s decision, we worry that it will come back to haunt him especially as Finch returns in glory and becomes the dean of the faculty where Stoner teaches. But that threat is never realised, and surprisingly so, considering all the other much more unlikely plagues that fall on Stoner\u2019s head. There is some mystery implied about Stoner\u2019s wife and her relationship with her parents but that too is never explained, a big gap since everything about her needs further development. McGahern says she is in the tradition of the \u2018beautiful, unstable\u2019 heroine found in O\u2019Neill, Tenessee Williams, Faulkner and Scott Fitzgerald. I can\u2019t imagine that any of those writers created a character as paper-thin as Edith Stoner. A further loose end is Stoner's first literature teacher, a man called Archer Sloane. He is given a significant role in the beginning but is not exploited very much afterwards. That is a real pity as he was my favourite character.The front cover of my copy contains a sticker which reads: \n  \n    The greatest novel you\u2019ve never read\n  \n If this is the greatest novel I had never read, what am I going to do for the rest of my life?

In the goodreads universe, where everyone else lives, this is apparently a much loved and lauded book. Heck, those good folks at the New York Review of Books tell us it's a classic. And has this to say about the main protagonist: William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world I'm sorry, but that's just a crock, even allowing for reviewer hyperbole. The very best that you could manage to say about Stoner is that he's a wraithlike nebbish who manages to glide through this dismal story without leaving an impression on anyone, least of all the reader. People seem to admire John Edward Williams's writing. The thing that baffled me is how any author can use so many words to write about a character and end up describing someone who is utterly devoid of a single distinguishing trait, or even a semblance of a personality. Stoner is a stick figure who, over the course of the book, gets to interact with other stick figures (the resentful wife, the condescending academic colleagues, the college friend with a lust for life who gets mowed down before his prime in the Great War, etc etc ad bloody nauseam) as they act out standard plot #24*. Now I know the number of plots is finite, so it might seem unjust to fault an author for serving up the same story yet again. Fair enough. But it's considered good sport to mess with the template a little bit, to inject one's own authorial \"spark\", to add *something* to make the story rise above the generic template. Maybe you take the A.J. Cronin slant and stir in a little rage against the system. Or you might just add a big ladleful of chicken soup for the soul and give the story a Mr Chips vibe. What you can't do, and hope to keep the reader's interest and sympathy, is just trot out the bare-bones generic version of the tale, with no embellishment**. But this is exactly what Williams has done here. What's the point? I wasn't looking for much. Hell, I'd have settled for the odd chunk of snappy dialog. A sense of humor. Anything at all, really. But even the most basic dialog seems to exceed Williams's capacity, and decent characterization eludes him completely.Anyway, the bottom line is that, in my universe, this book was bleak, predictable, excruciatingly dull. Like one of those dreadful Thomas Hardy books where everyone is miserable all the time, but without the local color. One star, maximum. Though it isn't quite dreadful enough to earn a slot on the \"intellectual con artist at work\" shelf.(Story #24: Intelligent {farmboy/kid from slums/juvenile delinquent/will be played by Matt Damon in the movie} transcends hardscrabble background to be first in the family to attend college. Lurches into an unfulfilling marriage that ends up making everyone miserable, teaches college, is left wondering if that's all there is. Alienation everywhere you look.)**:Several authors have written intelligently within the framework of the \"academic novel\" (Francine Prose, Jane Smiley, James Hynes, Kingsley Amis, among others), even managing to be funny. But those are authors with, you know, discernible intelligence, an affliction which John Edward Williams has apparently been spared.I just read David K's excellent review and realize that I am a hero, albeit a \"Master and Margarita\"-loving hero.

He is also somewhat an \"odd duck\" (Asperger's much??) somewhat similar to Stoner, except he was raised in New York by artist parents, and always had the academic knack. We read this sequentially last summer at a lake rental way up the coast here in Maine, and when he brought it to me over the porch he had tears in his eyes. Both of us, until this year, were approaching fiction as \"cheating\", when there was so much scholarly and political literature to keep up on! Reading Stoner (especially after we listened to Skippy Dies) opened us both back open to the wisdom of fiction. (In the case of Stoner, it made my old man finally decide it was time to consider retiring, still as vital with research, publication, and teaching as ever, but, at age 75, still.) Eventually, we let go of everything. The trick is realizing that sooner than later, but to hold principles and ideas and people what you can when you can for as long as you can. Sorry to end on a \"downer\" note, but the only thing I hated was the portrayal of the bizarre behavior of the wife. (It's always the crazy women who bring men such pain!) The scene with her waiting all day in bed naked waiting to be fertilized was silly and would only be written about a woman by a man. It doesn't seem plausible for mentally ill women to do that, much less your \"typical\" alienated, depressed, angry, cold-hearted wife. The other piece that went roughshod over my emotions was the prototypical, I'm afraid, horrifically petty and mean-spirited politics in the echelons of higher education. We really don't know anything ever, do we?

Its psyche is a constant concern with happiness, fulfillment, the American Dream and the way to this god given of all rights. Never has the isolated country been brought to its knees. Never has the culture and creed and thought of civilization of the American people been forced to view sadness as something other than an error to be fixed. Sadness is the result of tragedy, grief, a lightning strike catastrophe that time will heal. Naturally.America, you're lying to yourself. Likely you lied when this book came out, and nearly half a century later you're still lying. You think sadness is a pitfall, an abnormality, a mistake that you are culpable for and that you must seek to fix as soon as possible, however you can. Likewise, you believe you know what sadness is, hold true that all its cures lie between the filling and the novelty, the consumer culture and the midlife crisis. Don't you see? There's more to it than that.For a while now, I have contemplated becoming a teacher. I still plan on publishing at least one piece of mine in the wide realm of fiction, but there is always a question of financial stability.\nIt's for us that the University exists, for the dispossessed of the world; not for the students, not for the selfless pursuit of knowledge, not for any of the reasons that you hear. We give out the reasons, and we let a few of the ordinary ones in, those that would do in the world; but that's just protective coloration. Like the church in the Middle Ages, which didn't give a damn about the laity or even about God, we have our pretenses in order to survive. And we shall survive\u2014because we have to.\nIf I were younger, the matter of selfish shutting away of the self into the bubble of campus life would have bothered me. These days, I recognize where I would be of the most use, but more importantly, much more importantly, I recognize what would be of the most use for me. So, feel free to tear down my idols one usually puts up in place of a raison d'\u00eatre. I know the banality of my effort to live, and embrace it with open arms.\n\"But don't you know, Mr. Stoner?\" Sloane asked. \"Don't you understand about yourself yet? You're going to be a teacher.\"Suddenly Sloane seemed very distant, and the walls of the office receded. Stoner felt himself suspended in the wide air, and he heard his voice ask, \"Are you sure?\"\"I'm sure,\" Sloane said softly.\"How can you tell?\" How can you be sure?\"\"It's love. Mr. Stoner,\" Sloane said cheerfully. \"You are in love. It's as simple as that.\"\nThe subject will be some flavor of English and decided when the time has come, but more pressing questions of what type were whittled down to a mere few, the final one concerning the choice between high school and college answered a day ago. Passion's a poor word for the kind of marriage been life and literature and pedagogy I'm hinting at in the entity of a college professor. Born to do it suggests ideals of action and pushing the limits, neither of which I am much concerned with in the typical sense. I simply wish to make a living, but also live, and thrive, and love something I cannot put into words but can always find within the pages of a book. That's all.It will never be that simple. There will be people, and politics, and all too frequently and all too harshly the push of ideals will combat the shove of reality. There is a truth to that as well; we all have our reasons for living, and when it comes to the choice between personal change and hurting others, fear and stability, the latter is a common king.\nStoner said, \"Tell her\u2014he paused awkwardly\u2014\"tell her that, if she wants to, she can come live with us. She will be welcome.\"Edith smiled at him with a curious mixture of fondness and contempt. \"Oh, Willy. She'd rather die herself. Don't you know that?\"Stoner nodded, \"I suppose I do,\" he said.\nHere, the author comes the forefront, once again a dead white male who has managed to capture my heart in the contents of paper and ink. Here, though, there is also a treasure of character creation with insight into the why, not just the what. The wife, the daughter, the lover; it is the early 20th century, and each is painted with as heartbreaking palate of truth as was ever rendered. Here, the author knows his creations, and cares deeply for every one.\nHer moral training, both at the schools she attended and at home, was negative in nature, prohibitive in intent, and almost entirely sexual. The sexuality, however, was indirect and unacknowledged; therefore it suffused every other part of her education, which received most of its energy from that recessive and unspoken moral force.\nSad, is it not? When the usual panderings at a happy facade are pulled back from the pearly sheen of truth below. When a marriage is unhappy, yet persists on the backs of tradition again, and again, and again. When lovers at a level of equality rarely encouraged and less often achieved are blocked, yet do not sacrifice all they are for a fleeting possibility. When war is not seen as anything but a horror, a tragedy, a thing that excites all the young and rushes them off into the abyss, leaving behind empty rooms and broken souls.\n\"Honestly, things are so important to you. What difference could it make?\"And suddenly, after he said the words, it was not important. For an instant he felt the truth of what he said, and for the first time in months he felt lift away from him the weight of a despair whose heaviness he had not fully realized. Nearly giddy, almost laughing, he said again, \"It really isn't important.\"\nImportance is a state of mind, where living decides the price and living with yourself determines the worth. Face it, and through the shades of joy and the shadows of woe let your life be one worth living. Whatever happens, at no point will it fail, and never will it be a waste.\nHe let his fingers riffle through the pages and felt a tingling, as if those pages were alive. The tingling came through his fingers and coursed through his flesh and bone; he was minutely aware of it, and he waited until it contained him, until the old excitement that was like terror fixed him where he lay.\nLover of reading, let it go on.\n\"I have taught at this University for nearly forty years. I do not know what I would have done if I had not been a teacher. If I had not taught, I might have\u2014\" He paused, as if distracted. Then he said, with a finality, \"I want to thank you all for letting me teach.\"\nLover of thought, let it continue.\nThe fingers loosened, and the book they had held moved slowly and then swiftly across the still body and fell into the silence of the room.\nLovers of living, fear neither the reaper nor the blues. The former makes each life significant, and the latter can exquisitely flow. Stoner lived in peace for a love of his and died in such a way as to render questions of \"successful living\" useless. I cannot think of a humanity more beautiful."}, {"userName": "Himanshu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10261330-himanshu", "userReview": "Empathy/\u02c8\u025bmp\u0259\u03b8i/nounthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.Coming from its Greek roots, this word discovered its origin in early 20th century and found itself perfectly placed between the extremities of sympathy and apathy to satiate our need to express what we have been feeling for centuries long. To detach ourself from the de rigueur warmth of sympathy and the unfilial abyss of apathy. With my limited knowledge on such subjects I wonder what word would have given us this respite before.Since I have come to know of this word, I always imagined it to be like a vector having a magnitude of certain feelings directed from another person towards me, giving me a significant understanding of the other. I never thought that it could go beyond the two dimensions. But this tale of William Stoner changed that and how! He is one of those rare characters which are laid out as most uncomplicated and rudimentary, and at a cursory look would seem even as boring. But then when you have John Williams taking you cautiously by your hand and delicately placing you so close to the character that the meaning of the word empathy overwhelms you with all its profundity. Please note, you might be inclined towards sympathizing with Mr. Stoner at many stages, but then eventually his indifference would compel you to reassess.It is quite remarkable how through a life of one person so much has been achieved as a writer by Williams and so much has been precipitated as a reader to me. Fundamentally, most of our experiences stem from the changes that we have in our lives, both obligatory and voluntary. But in case of Stoner, there were only handful of these changes. He never left the University which he first saw as a child after leaving his father's farm, he never changed the city of his residence, his acquaintances were rare and few, and he had only one real vacation in all his life. Still, life happened.\nYou, too, are cut out for failure; not that you\u2019d fight the world. You\u2019d let it chew you up and spit you out, and you\u2019d lie there wondering what was wrong. Because you\u2019d always expect the world to be something it wasn\u2019t, something it had no wish to be. The weevil in the cotton, the worm in the beanstalk, the borer in the corn. You couldn't face them, and you couldn't fight them; because you\u2019re too weak, and you\u2019re too strong. And you have no place to go in the world.\nHe fought with an indifference and audacity which did not come from within but from the circumstances that compelled him and threw him in the face of undesirable adversities. Happiness was something that he saw from the corner of his eyes but could not somehow behold it with open arms. \nThose things that he held most deeply were most profoundly betrayed when he spoke of them to his classes; what was most alive withered in his words; and what moved him most became cold in its utterance . And the consciousness of his inadequacy distressed him so greatly that the sense of it grew habitual, as much a part of him as the stoop of his shoulders\nBut he was not unhappy, no. He had his love for literature and an unbridled passion for teaching which drove him one step at a time to another. He did not fall into the luring abyss which his failures pointed out to. I think he never even saw those as failures, he just saw them as disappointments which are given in a life and can be overcome with time and hope. His marriage, for example, consistently called for his acceptance as a failure but he let on with a subdued nonchalance along with a melancholy that got etched on him forever. There was an episode of redemption to be found for both Stoner and the reader when he finds himself profused with the emotion of love, as they say.\nThey had been brought up in a tradition that told them in one way or another that the life of the mind and the life of the senses were separate and, indeed, inimical; they had believed, without ever having really thought about it, that one had to be chosen at some expense of the other\nThis especially breathed life into his being and carved a memory which he could always reminisce and be secretly proud of. Oh Bill! What a life you had had. I shall refrain from closing this review with my words, in stead let John Williams say it for me.\n\nHe had, in odd ways, given it to every moment of his life, and had perhaps given it most fully when he was unaware of his giving. It was a passion neither of the mind nor of the flesh; rather, it was a force that comprehended them both, as if they were but the matter of love, its specific substance. To a woman or to a poem, it said simply: Look! I am alive."}, {"userName": "Ilse", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22848274-ilse", "userReview": "Those who can, do.

Plenty of benevolent advices and platitudes will whizz around your ears, to help you to bounce back . Remember, it is all in your mind. Happiness is the result of your approach to life, not of what happens to you. Revolt, anger, complaining or denial won\u2019t change anything. Focus on what is instead of on what should be. Accept, accept, accept. Take one step at time, keep moving, keep working to what you want in life.In our times of voluntarist belief in shaping our own destiny, only fools refuse or refrain to act or at least to try to take control of their own life .But perhaps the only sensible thing to do is keep breathing. Minimal action, minimal reaction. Just embrace plain and simple old-fashioned and untimely Stoicism. Like Stoner. Wisdom lies in tuning our lives to the divine order of the universe and to want what actually is the case. As emotions have an external source, as we are being moved, touched, affected, impassioned, be the Master of Yourself and control your emotions. Do not strive for pleasure. Be un-touched. Only a fool tries to impose his own selfish desires upon reality and is the plaything of his emotions and desires. The consolations of philosophy applied to ordinary life. Amongst the teachers I know, there is a bittersweet running joke, when talking about the essence of their profession. Why does someone chooses to become a teacher? And, bursting with self-mockery laughter, they sing in unison Those who can, do. Those who can\u2019t, teach. Stoner\u2019s friend Dave Masters, could probably agree with it, when he is partly ironically speaking about the true nature of universities: \u201dIt is an asylum or \u2014 what do they call them now? \u2014 a rest home, for the infirm, the aged, the discontent, and the otherwise incompetent.\"This novel strongly reminisced academic life, its seclusion and petty machinations. Not having Stoner\u2019s gift of endurance, I fled, abandoning the dream of a life of learning and science after 6 years of struggle, as university was not the refuge and source of wisdom this naive working class daughter hoped for, but a ruthless, almost egotistic habitat crushing me \u2013 a place where teaching didn\u2019t really matter. As Ian trenchantly points out, if we empathize with Stoner\u2019s dire life, couldn\u2019t it be because of our own wounds and experiences too? Imagine yourself living together with Stoner. However wise and admirable his stoicism, there is also a solipsistic aspect to it. According to his creator, Stoner is altogether a happy man:\u201dHe had a very good life. He had a better life than most people do, certainly. He was doing what he wanted to do, he had some feeling for what he was doing, he had some sense of the importance of the job he was doing.\u201d But what about the effect of his stoic attitudes on the lives of the others in his life? His parents, wife, daughter, lover? Does he really care? I disliked Williams\u2019s portrayal of Edith, Stoner\u2019s vicious battle-axe of a wife \u2013 I guess I am not conversant enough with the perception of American women in that part of history, but her one-dimensional depiction hardly exceeds the caricature image of the neurotic frigid female, like the Madge in Frank Zappa\u2019s Harry you\u2019re a beast (You paint your head - Your mind is dead -- You don't even know what I just said - THAT'S YOU: AMERICAN WOMANHOOD! You're phony on top - You're phony underneath - You lay in bed & grit your teeth. MADGE, I WANT YOUR BODY! HARRY, GET BACK! MADGE, IT'S NOT MERELY PHYSICAL! HARRY, YOU'RE A BEAST!).Coming no further than these personal musings, I feel not able to do justice to this poignant novel, hitting a little too close to home, for more than one reason. Yes, Stoner is as unforgettable a character as many reviews point out. Yes, in many respects, I know a Stoner. I married him 16 years ago. He is, like Stoner, the most stoic person I ever met. He illustrates his philosophy lectures with a cartoon from D.

William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.", "title": "Stoner", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/166997.Stoner", "average": 4.29, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320600716l/166997.jpg", "reviews": 8036, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/51229.John_Williams", "name": "John  Williams"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45497.John_McGahern", "name": "John McGahern"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Classics", "Literature", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/166997.Stoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28185456", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13517090-stoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34763184", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18841055-stoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17840080-stoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790264-stoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751579-stoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/457228.Butcher_s_Crossing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89231.Augustus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1504869.Nothing_But_the_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/971864.English_Renaissance_Poetry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14288565-the-necessary-lie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
