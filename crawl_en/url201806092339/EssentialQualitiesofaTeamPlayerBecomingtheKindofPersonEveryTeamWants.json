Teamwork is not just a buzzword, but an important part of any organization that wants to function well and prosper. Of the 17 most important qualities of a successful team player that Maxwell mentions, I believe that adaptability, communicativeness, enthusiasm and competence are the most practical in the current business environment. As mentioned, Maxwell covers 17 essentials for team members and he does it in a very consistent manner. Each chapter is divided into five sections; I think the most interesting section is when Maxwell uses actual people or organizations to illustrate the quality he is covering in the chapter. One of the real-life examples he uses is Milwaukee\u2019s own Harley-Davidson. Maxwell contends that the reason Harley-Davidson was able to come back from hard times in the early 1980s was the enthusiasm of the executives as well as that of the employees. In another chapter he uses the example of Jonas Salk, who was the driving force behind the research team that developed the polio vaccine. When he needed test subjects to inoculate with inactive polio cells in order to determine the efficacy of the vaccine, he, his wife and their three sons were part of the first group. Talk about commitment!I also liked the Bringing it Home section in which Maxwell succinctly describes a way to improve a skill, e.g., to improve your communication, you should \u201cbe candid,\u201d \u201cbe quick\u201d and \u201cbe inclusive.\u201d A basic premise of the book is an obvious one: better players make for better teams. It is up to the players to integrate these qualities into their lives, whether it is at school, at home, on a sports team or in an organization or workplace. I believe Maxwell's analysis is right on the money and a very refreshing way of looking at teamwork, a skill that is vital in today's economy. Social and networking skills have never been more essential in the workplace and their importance will continue well into the future."}, {"userName": "Ajeya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298386-ajeya", "userReview": "It quotes a man's inspiration to believe in bible and then fight because he interpreted \" If a man can make peace by fighting, he is a peacemaker\". This on the initial few pages may put off any peaceful reader. On further tolerance and reading on,It quotes \" It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinions; it is easy in solitude to live after your own; but the great man is he who in the midst of he crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude\" - Ralph Waldo EmersonSuch quotes makes you feel that you can write something and leave your name behind as a quotable quote.The book is small and readable. If you care about baseball , there is some example from that. Quoting movies in a leadership book was strange. This book does that too. On the preface you see that there was someone to write and proofread this small book. This makes me believe that you need a bunch of quotes and movies and let someone else write the book and proofread and put their names in acknowledgement. Not Ghostwriting!In sum total this book is a miracle, as it has very little to offer but still makes it to the shelves of leadership skills collection in university."}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7478514-chelsea", "userReview": "This was given to me by my Office Manager to read. I have to admit that I usually do not like these kinds of book, I much more into the fiction/fantasy genre. However, this is a pretty good book on teamwork and how to be a team player. I liked that with each trait that a teamplayer should have, there was an example of a 'famous' person who had that trait. However, I did not recognize a few of these famous people, either because they were athletes or because they were of an older generation. This book also showed an example of someone, not a famous person, who did not have this trait and was therefore not a teamplayer. This book is a 'self-help book' and also had way for you to better yourself and to become a teamplayer. If you need your office to be better at working together this might be a good book for you; however, I would not recommend reading it for fun."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49890760-matt", "userReview": "I started a new position in the Outreach and Information Technology (OIT) department at Penn State\u2019s Outreach and Online education (World Campus) back in June and was introduced to the book \u201cThe 17 Essential Qualities of a Team Player\u201d at one of our monthly team meetings.

It is a typical John Maxwell gem, full of easily digestible principles sprinkled with interesting and inspiring antecedents and real-life stories. Maxwell definitely has a formula for his writing, but it surprisingly works and is surprisingly effective as well. I liked it because it breaks down some ideas on what it takes to be a good team player, which is pretty essential in today's business environment. What I also learned is that a good team player is also a good leader (shocking, I know). The thing is that a good team will beat out an extraordinary individual every single time. And if the extraordinary individual can become a good team player, then the team will become unstoppable. So, all in all, a good little book about the principles of teamwork and how to be a better team player."}, {"userName": "Karan Goel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40428940-karan-goel", "userReview": "Short, easy read.
