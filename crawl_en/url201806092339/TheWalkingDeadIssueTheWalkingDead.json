That was few days ago and we just finished watching the second season and I can honestly say, the show is brilliant, the plot is addictive and the character development and relationship drama is fascinating. I'm getting attached to some of the characters and that makes me nervous because there are sudden twists in the storyline, things go wrong fast, characters die at each turn making it difficult to know who'll make it to the end of each episode and each season. The TV show is full of nail-biting drama and action but it also made me curious about the graphic novels that inspired it, so I decided to try reading this short free graphic book...this is my first comic/graphic novel ever! This Graphic Novels is free on Amazon and it's a great introduction to The Walking Dead comic/graphic novels and the TV show. It covers only the first day when Rick Grimes (Sheriff from small town in Kentucky) wakes up from Coma in hospital ...Rick finds that the world has gone to hell, the dead are walking and trying to eat the living Somehow he has to find his wife and son but in the meantime he needs to learn to survive in this new world. This book sets the scene for all the drama to come and it also adds a hopeful optimistic note in the form of Rick's new neighbour Morgan Jones and his little son. So far, the adaption from comic to TV is pretty accurate but I'm sure there'll be differences that add to the enjoyment of the plot, world building and characters in each comic and I can't wait to enjoy all that and see my favourite TV show from a new angle and also learn to enjoy reading from a new medium. I've already got The Walking Dead, Book One full of twelve volumes and I can't wait to immerse myself in The Walking Dead graphic novel whilst watching season three of the TV show."}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11855472-steven", "userReview": "Moderately entertaining."}, {"userName": "Joel ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22581293-joel", "userReview": "I will start saying that I'm not a fan of the tv series.

Most likely, I probably wouldn't have ever tried it, let alone enjoyed it. Thank you, buddy. Now, having watched The Walking Dead a number of times, I thought I knew what to expect, and I was both right and wrong. On the one handle, the comprising twenty-six black and gray pages are nearly identical to the pilot episode. On the other, there seems to be more heart and soul here; more anticipation.  One of the series' recurring themes-humanity itself--takes center stage, superimposing the carnage of the walking dead themselves. Another striking element is the artwork, a lot of which blew my mind and will haunt me forever. Seeing the characters made me realize just how SPOT-ON the show's cast truly is. Andrew Lincoln and Lennie James fully personify them as seen here. I can barely process it.  Said artwork of Robert Kirkman and Co. crept up on me, too. I can't emphasize this enough because the first few pages underwhelmed me, but before long, I had passed the halfway point and nearly every panel impressed me in some way or another. I cannot describe the feelings better than that. Looking back on page one, there's some disconnect, as the two look and feel almost like polar opposites of one another.  It was neat to see it all unfold in another medium. It felt akin to magic to behold the immaculate likenesses of Rick, Morgan, and little Duane. Seeing them in general was spectacular, and I greatly anticipate reading this series, which I love even more now. I never it was possible to love and admire the hard work and dedication more than I already did, but somehow I do, and that's a powerful thing.

The story is EPIC and the artwork just blows your mind. I found it styled very much like old school comics with the drawings done in greyscale and with SO MUCH detail that you can't help but sit there and drink it all in.

Policeman, Rick Grimes wakes up to find himself in hospital. The place appears very strange and deserted, so he decides to see if he can find anyone. He arrives at a set of double doors that have been shut with a metal bar through the handle, so he decides to remove the bar, opens the door and looks inside. To his shock horror he sees a room full of zombies. One of the zombies tries to grab Rick, so Rick runs for his life and flees the hospital. He makes his way to his home, but he finds the place deserted. After going outside to try and decide what to do next, he is suddenly hit over the head and knocked unconscious. When he awakes, he finds himself in the company of Morgan Jones and Duane, Morgan's son. Morgan tells Rick that many people went to the city for protection. Rick decides that his family must have gone to the city of Atlanta and he must make his way to the city to find them. Rick, Morgan and Duane head for the police station. Once there, they arm themselves with guns, bullets etc., and Rick puts on his spare uniform that was in his locker. Rick gives Morgan the keys to a police car, telling him that the car will be far more reliable than his current one. Rick gets into one of the other police cars and they drive off in separate directions, with Rick heading towards Atlanta.This is a short 32 page comic, #1 in series of 50.
