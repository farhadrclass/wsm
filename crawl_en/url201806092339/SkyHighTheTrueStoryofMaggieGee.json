Maggie not only becomes a pilot but, one of two Chinese American who served in WWII. Maggie loved the challenge of training with WASP( Women's Airforce Service Pilots). They trained just as the men, she learned to parachute, make emergency landings, loop the loop and fly low over cows' heads. Maggie inspired stories became a dream come true. This read can help with encouraging children to follow their dreams and believe while doing it.

Throughout the book, we learn about the stereotypes that Maggie faced as not only being a Chinese- American, but also a woman. It was heartbreaking to read about the discriminating assumptions her family and friends would make about her when she would say that she wanted to be a pilot, but her determination is extremely admirable. She overcame many struggles to get to where she finally succeeded and achieved her ultimately goal of flying airplanes and joining the WASP.Ideas For Classroom Use:One possible way to incorporate this informational text into my classroom is when we are discussing gender or ethnic stereotypes. It is important for students to realize that despite their gender, race, ethnicity, or culture, they can accomplish their goals, especially career goals. I would hope that this book would convince all of my females in the class that there is no \"man's job\"; that women can be successful in the same careers as men! I would also include this text on a lesson regarding perseverance and determination. Throughout all of Maggie Gee's struggles and obstacles, she kept her eyes on her goal and worked hard to achieve it!Why This Book is a WOW Book:Sky High: The True Story of Maggie Gee is a WOW Book for me because of the strength and determination this woman had to achieve her goals. Her hard work for such a daunting goal makes anything single obstacle look simple. She is a true inspiration for every woman who is working towards her goals. I loved the attitude that Maggie Gee displayed throughout the entire text as well. She refused to let her set backs or discriminatory remarks from other bring her down, instead that fueled her even more to accomplish her goal!"}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6191699-ed", "userReview": "Moss, Marissa. (2009). Sky High: The True Story of Maggie Gee. Berkeley, CA: Tricycle Press 32 pp. ISBN 1-58246-280-1 Hard Cover); $16.99So what do you do when you want to fly and you are both Asian and female? Today, this question strikes us as demeaning and almost unspeakable. For Maggie Gee, however, an Asian pilot during World War II, the question was akin to the elephant in the room\u2014always looming whether spoken of or not. During World War II we did not have many women pilots and even fewer Asian females in the cockpits of planes. Maggie is just one of two Asian women serving as one of the Women Airforce Service Pilots! Faced with the skepticism not only of a country, but her family as well, Maggie drove herself to flight school (learning how to drive a car along the way) and mastered the sky. In this fine elementary picture book biography, we are presented with some of the background material that paved the way for the next generation to dream of blasting off into space (as depicted in Almost Astronauts)."}, {"userName": "Margaret Boling", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2769538-margaret-boling", "userReview": "8/9/13 ** I stumbled on this book the week before school started as I made my annual trip to the library to gather picture book biographies of scientists. I always keep my eyes out for biographies of other interesting people, though I am rather picky about the format. I prefer the picture book format, rather than the more \"academic\" mini-chapter book format that populates much of the j section of the biographies.I'd never heard of Maggie Gee, but thought that this book would fit extremely well with the new collection of \"Dreamers\" picture books. I recently posted about the book More than Anything Else (Bradby/Soenpiet), which was the first \"Dreamer\" picture book I read this year. The second was this, about Maggie Gee, who idolized Amelia Earhart and dreamed of becoming an early female aviator herself. These books will form the core of a class-wide conversation about our dreams for ourselves.I don't own it yet, but plan to rectify that problem soon."}, {"userName": "Deb (Readerbuzz) Nance", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance", "userReview": "Maggie Gee was one of only two Chinese Americans to serve as a WASP in World War II.

It tells that as a child, Maggie told stories of the future when she would be a pilot.

The book also addressed how many people were surprised that an Asian American woman was flying for the US military. This would be a good book to read to students to let them know that everyone is equal.

Other families went to baseball games or the movies, but not mine . . . We went to watch the airplanes. . . . Maggie dreamed of flying--just like her favorite pilot, Amelia Earhart. She told her brothers and sisters stories of flying across oceans and deserts, and all around the world. But in the 1920s and 1930s, few girls took to the sky. Then, when Maggie grew up, her whole world changed overnight: the United States entered World War II, and everyone in her family was affected. Maggie knew that this was the time to support her country--and it was her chance to fly. Young Maggie Gee became one of only two Chinese American Women Airforce Service Pilots to serve in WWII.Based on the true adventures of a girl not bound by gravity, Marissa Moss's stirring story and Carl Angel's brilliant illustrations depict what determination, bravery, and boundless possibilities look like when dreams are allowed to soar sky high.", "title": "Sky High: The True Story of Maggie Gee", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6745919-sky-high", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320431816l/6745919.jpg", "reviews": 33, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13597.Marissa_Moss", "name": "Marissa Moss"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3035445.Carl_Angel", "name": "Carl Angel"}], "type": ["Biography", "Childrens", "Nonfiction", "History", "Childrens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6745919-sky-high", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24172.Amelia_s_Notebook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/669168.Amelia_Writes_Again", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1133815.Amelia_Hits_The_Road", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15842624-barbed-wire-baseball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24173.Amelia_s_6th_Grade_Notebook"]}
