When brainstorming business ideas, use the principle of Convergence.\"Convergence represents the intersection between something you especially like to do or are good at doing (preferably both) and what other people are also interested in.\"2. Building a business structured around your desired lifestyle is possible.Although it may seem like a pipe dream to most people working in corporate jobs, Chris shows this is possible. He identifies 1,500 individuals like himself who have built businesses earning $50,000 or more from a small initial investment (hence the $100 Startup title). Most microbusinesses earn at least $50,000 a year in net income and have fewer than five employees.3. When you make business about helping others, you\u2019ll have plenty of work.\"When you get stuck, ask yourself: How can I give more value? Or more simply: How can I help my customers more?\"4. It\u2019s more powerful to talk about the emotional benefits your business will provide to its customers, not just the features of your product or service.\"Most people want more of some things (love, money, attention) and less of other things (stress, anxiety, debt). Always focus on what you can add or take away to improve someone's life.\"5. Give people fish.\"Teach a man to fish and he\u2019ll eat for a day\u201d is a powerful concept, but it\u2019s terrible business advice. Businesses exist because sometimes people just want the fish.6. Follow your passion, but only if you can identify a market for what you can offer.\"...you usually don't get paid for your hobby itself; you get paid for helping other people pursue the hobby or for something indirectly related to it.\"7. Effective marketing is based on invitation, not persuasion.\"Most of us like to buy, but we don't like to be sold...compelling offers often create an illusion that a purchase is an invitation, not a pitch.\"8. Planning is overrated \u2014 have a bias for action. Most of the case studies had a common thread of getting started quickly first before extensive planning.\"There's nothing wrong with planning, but you can spend a lifetime making a plan that never turns into action. In a battle between planning and action, action wins.\"9. Avoid your customer\u2019s immediate pang of anxiety from a purchase by immediately overdelivering.\"You'll want to get out in front of this feeling by making people feel good about the action they just took...give them more than they expected. You can do this by upgrading their purchase unexpectedly by sending a handwritten thank-you card in the mail or in whatever way makes the most sense for your business. The point is that the small things count.\"10. Chris provides several comprehensive checklists and planning tools to help build your business. Examples include Six Steps to Getting Started Right Now, the One-Page Partnership Agreement, and the Thirty-Nine-Step Product Launch Checklist.11. Be a hustler, not a charlatan or a martyr.\"A charlatan is all talk, with nothing to back up their claims. A martyr is all action with plenty of good work to talk about, but remains unable or unwilling to do the talking. A hustler represents the ideal combination: work and talk fused together.\"12. Incorporate a \u201cStrategic Giving Marketing Plan\u201d by giving freely.\"It's not about keeping score or trading favors on a quid pro quo basis; it's about genuinely caring and trying to improve someone else's life whenever you can...Strategic giving is about being genuinely, truly helpful without the thought of a potential payback.\"13. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to pursue a dream. Stop waiting and begin it now.How This Resonates With MeI admire Chris. With his passion for travel, business, and following your dream, he has inspired me to take my sabbatical and continually remember the importance of working on your life, rather than just in it. The lifestyle of freedom he\u2019s achieved is impressive and has proven it\u2019s possible by showing the way. This is a lifestyle I continue to strive for, and I\u2019m happy to have Chris as an example to emulate."}, {"userName": "Tami", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1897540-tami", "userReview": "I really wanted to love this book. For being an inspirational title, I think it did already. It's gotten me to scheme about my grand plan to set myself free someday from working for others and start devising a business plan. However, I don't actually think reading it got me any closer to doing it.The examples shared were lovely, but they're just quick snippets of what the person's business is. Telling me that John Doe quit his corporate job and now helps business people schedule vacations and plan trips doesn't really help ME create a viable business. I also wish there weren't so many examples in the book of people who used an artistic skill, because that's not accessible to those of us who aren't crafty or artsy. The author repeated himself many times as if this was a series of blog posts that ended up being mashed into a book.Finally, I felt like this book WAS Chris Guillebeau's $100 startup idea. I felt like we were playing right into what he wanted, to make a business so he could travel around the world. I think he succeeded - lots of people are buying his book and talking about it. It all just felt too meta and not actionable enough for me."}, {"userName": "Mel Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5012248-mel-bradley", "userReview": "I am a big fan and follower of Chris Guillebeau, so my expectations for this book were a bit... high. It was a very quick read, but don't expect any big revelations or insider secrets here. This is a great glimpse into what is possible with a small investment, for people who have absolutely no experience in being an entrepreneur or online business owner. For everyone else, you'll find yourself rolling your eyes in quite a few places knowing that MOST of the story has been left out. One of the most honest and real moments in the book was when Chris shared that he spent $10,000 on advertising for a previous guide - finally, some real information! But other than that nugget, much of what was shared was small anecdotes from Chris and his friends... He shares a story about a small literary agent who has been successful on his own, and with a little digging, you realize that it's Chris' agent. This book would have gotten a higher rating had real information been shared - instead of trying to highlight some people only briefly, it would have added more value had the people's stories been shared at length and in-depth. Instead, it was surface-level information of success stories - none of the behind the scenes blood, sweat and tears."}, {"userName": "Dave Bolton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2983866-dave-bolton", "userReview": "In the genre of \"books that are actually long blog posts\", this book really is the latest in \"lean startup\" type works, stripped back as far as it could go. Will anyone else in the lifestyle design/lean startup area be able to rip more meat from the bones of these ideas, leaving just a ten bullet point list?Also, the case studies were not very useful -- very lightweight anecdotes.It's not completely without value, but I don't personally know anyone I could recommend it for."}, {"userName": "Jim Razinha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha", "userReview": "First: my wife bought this, read it and liked it. She wanted me to read it. So I did. I found 15% substance, 83% anecdote (examples, case studies, choose your definition), and 2% vapor. Needs more \"how\" to be really useful, and Guillebeau shortchanged the \"how\" he did write, though there were a couple of good resources found on his website...Another thing irritated me: quotes obviously taken from some unsourced site like brainyquotes.com. Any discerning reader would immediately see that Karl Marx or Anais Nin could not have said the quotes he attributed to them (Nin did not use the word \"hustle\" in any of her writings). That's just lazy on the part of Guillebeau, and sends me the message that he doesn't think his readers will call him on something like that. The secondary message is that if a little research uncovers a falsehood, what am I to think of the rest of the text?Bottom line: best startup is to write a book about startups, publish it and sell it. But that's been done."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12245435-lee", "userReview": "I think it' a good read. The $100 Startup shows up what's possible - but Guillebeau doens't really go further than that. The book can motivate you, but if you really want to know how to approach launching a startup, \"Lean Startup\" by Eric Ries (for the theory) and \"Running Lean\" by Ash Maurya (for applying the principle) are obligatory.It didn't leave a lasting impression, but it's a good read nonetheless so i go with four stars."}, {"userName": "Dorothy R", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5931517-dorothy-r", "userReview": "From my Amazon Review: \"The $100 Startup\" is a book that primarily focuses on moving past the barriers that we and others place in front of our desires. These barriers (not enough money, knowledge, experience, demand, etc.)make it easy for us to not go into business. Not going into business allows us not to fail. However, this self-protective instinct automatically allows us not to succeed either. The book encourages a quick, no-holds barred start-up, because the leap is what is often the most difficult. Following the leap, there are other helpful hints in this manuscript that relate to pricing and sales. Mr. Guillebeau illustrates that sometimes income is better with slightly higher pricing, and slightly lower sales volume, then it is based on quantity alone. Other helpful points cover whether or not to hire employees, whether or not to grow, when to say no, why you might not want EVERY potential customer, and so on.I think this book might be just as helpful to existing small business owners as it is to those looking to start a business. The different sections on differentiation and customer service are insightful and seem to repeat themselves over and over through a variety of the case studies. And as mentioned before, the section on pricing is very interesting and perhaps not as intuitive as might be expected."}, {"userName": "Beth Lequeuvre", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1443274-beth-lequeuvre", "userReview": "\"The basics of starting a business are very simple;you don't need an MBA (keep the $60,000 tuition), venture capital or even a detailed plan.

People willing to pay for it: your customers3. A way to get paid: how you'll exchange a product or service for money\"Seriously? First off it's bad enough that you thought any one who was thinking about starting a business needed to have that explained. Secondly, it was simple enough in the first sentence, did you really have to break it down further?

His story opens the book.The $100 Startup is a very interesting and eye-opening read: many of the people featured just got going with something rather than giving it a great deal of advanced study. The book would have benefited by going deeper into each story -- I wanted more about exactly HOW some of them got started, what obstacles they met along the way, and how they overcome those obstacles. In particular, I was intrigued by the story of Naomi Dunford, who apparently launched an online empire from nothing (Ittybiz) by offering to brainstorm with people for $250 a pop. Apparently people were willing to hire her for this right away... how did THAT happen?The author also undoubtedly encountered some people who tried to launch a \"$100 startup\", failed, and wound up concluding that this life was not for them. Those cautionary tales would have offered some good lessons to anyone considering the approach the book recommends.In fairness, much of that information could be contained in the materials the author sells on his website. The $100 Startup gives a valuable introduction to the idea of starting a business on a shoestring, and planted at least one idea-to-be-seriously-explored in this reader's head."}, {"userName": "Farnoosh Brock", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17483237-farnoosh-brock", "userReview": "There's always a more perfect time in your life that you wish you had read the books that cross your path. This is how I fel about The $100 Startup - I wish I had read it - or rather, I wish Chris had written it - about 5 years ago when I was still stumbling around, lost and confused and disillusioned with Corporate America, and beyond discouraged about doing anything I could love. The Corporate America culture is brilliant at shunning any ideas of creativity and innovation and certainly not encouraging in anyway to those who want to strike out on their own. If someone had told me just how POSSIBLE it is for any of us to start our own thriving and profitable microbusiness would be - NOT EASY but POSSIBLE - I would have jumped at the chance. So while I found a lot of this information in this book to be familiar - I know that it serves as an ideal resource for those who are new to entrepreneurship today. I felt fortunate to know about 70% of the wonderful individuals in the case studies, and having been around the blogosphere for a while now, I echo Chris Guillebeau's heart-filled approach to starting a business and doing something you can love. Chris lives his words. He is a genuinely well-meaning success story, and I love that he chose to share this. The stories CAN happen to you, if you choose to believe and to do and to give yourself a real chance. I'll be recommending this to my Smart Exit Blueprint class and writing up a more extensive review at my blog on Prolific Living. Enjoy and as Tony Robbins says, Live with Passion! :)"}, {"userName": "SooYoung", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124263-sooyoung", "userReview": "disclosure: i won a copy of the book from Chris Guillebeau's website/blog: Art of Non-Conformity of which I am a regular follower.i was in the midst of my final days at work when i received the $100 Startup in the mail. i had quit my job because i was ready to 'take the bull by the horns,' so to speak and go freelance. this wasn't just about a job change, but a life change - i decided it was time for me to live my life the way i want, i wanted to \"create a new future\" as part of the book's subtitle reminded me.the first part of the book talks a lot about the very real possibility of working for yourself. what is happiness, what is value, how to combine those with your skills. one of the sections is called \"Reality Check Checklist.\" this part of the book I loved - it reassured me, i wasn't going off the deep end, the idea that putting passion and purpose at the center of your life's pursuits is truly the best way to live. the middle (and largest section) of the book are success stories (with a few occasional anecdotes on failure.) while i liked these stories, they started to blur together by the end and i even skipped some pages/sections. it's probably just who i am, but i always take these stories with a grain of salt - you never know where these people came from, the sort of help they had, the level of their success, etc etc. not to undermine their success but it's not necessarily fair either to equate their 'results' to your potential success. i liked the stories that were interesting stories in and of themselves, start-up business related or not (like the story of Rhett would be compelling in any book, not just a book about start-ups.). but otherwise i think everyone has to learn their own lessons in life (and business.) lastly, the book ends by focusing back on you. this book is ultimately for the reader - if you want to be small, stay small. if you fail, don't give up. if you are offered advice, take what's worthwhile and ignore the rest. i recommend this book to anyone looking to make that leap who might not be the most-likely-to-succeed type. it's okay if you don't fit the entrepreneurial profile, the profile is a cliche anyway. take what you want out of the book and leave the rest.one other thing that prompted a 3 instead of 4 star rating. and this may not have bothered anyone else - but the design of the book is cheap. it looks like a published at-home, clip-art, self-help book. one of the lessons of the book is to just get your idea/work out there. but i think there's something to be said about making sure it reflects your standards of quality and care."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10819180-cindy", "userReview": "When I first picked this book up, I thought it would be about how to start a small business on little or no money. That was not the case, and in fact, I wasn't sure I would even finish the entire book. But it turned out to be much more.The $100 Start Up is really an inspiring guide to stepping out on your own, doing what you love, without fear, (your own, or)of what others might say. (You know who I'm talking about, the nay-sayers).Throughout the book, the author interviews various entrepreneurs in different sectors of businesses. He asks many questions; and business owners are more than happy to share their personal stories.What kind of threw me back, was the fact that the author talks about creating a business where one can \"give back\", to which I thought, \"how does this apply in my business, as a jewelry designer?\" But with further reading and exploration, I understood more.The author stresses excellent points, such as:giving the customer what they want, connecting with others, and maybe even showing potential customers that you do have what they want!There are so many helpful insights in this book, that I won't give away here, and encourage anyone who wants to work for themselves, be creative, and be happy to pick this book up and give it a thorough read."}, {"userName": "Ahmad", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45509954-ahmad", "userReview": "very inspiring, well structured, simply great book."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7599851-mel", "userReview": "I would love to write a bunch of beautifully scripted words about this book, but it just would neither truly reflect this book nor do it justice. So, I will just make this as concise and straightforward as the book is.I\u2019ve spent a ton of time laboring through free video seminars of big names of people who live amazing lives, work from anywhere they wish to travel with that now so predictable \u201chook\u201d to compel you to buy into their brand of \u201cschool\u201d or \u201cassociation\u201d or \u201cacademy\u201d etc. that cost thousands of dollars even with their \u201cbuy now\u201d discounts! None of which I can ever afford however try to use the \u201cFree\u201d content they so generously offered. But all it was, was a taste\u2026 part of the hook.Tired of that nonsense? So am I!When I first learned of Chris Guillebreau\u2019s book The $100 Startup\u2026 My immediate thoughts were\u2026 \u201cThis is too good to be true.\u201d and \u201cWhat is the hook?\u201d Once I got the book in my hands, I realized, Chris is delivering an amazing value to anyone either thinking about starting a business, struggling for direction and steps to launch and even those already in business that need to make some shifts to gain some momentum! The book is an easy read. No big words or trendy words. This is straight forward, nothing fancy common sense with the nuts and bolts of what you need to start ANY business! Even the graphics are crisp, clean, nothing fancy and communicate a powerful message within themselves. The book contains clear concise background information \u2013 just what the reader needs and nothing more; then goes on to give the reader action steps. The plans are easy to find because they are in gray boxes \u2013 so a reader can read through the book and then come back and easily find the task lists.What sold me on the credibility of the content was that this is not a \u201cHow I Did It\u201d book by Chris Guillebeau. Chris interviewed several successful business owners that fit a list of parameters \u2013 must be successful (duh) and he specifically tells you what he defined as successful by how much money the businesses were bringing in the last two years. Also the business has to be small (no more than 5 people \u2013 most of them were less) with little or no start-up cost. I also normally fall asleep with nuts and bolts type books with boring step by step stuff\u2026 However, not with $100 StartUp! This book was very engaging and interesting!I was once told in a class that when writing a review to lend credibility to my review I should find something I see room for improvement. The only thing I could come up with? That it didn\u2019t come out sooner!When Chris in the book gives his One Page Business Plan in his illustration at the beginning of the chapter \u2013 there are two steps on a sticky note in the illustration. I am not going to give away the secret. But his entire book basically tells you how to do the first step and the second step is the reward for the first step. This is one of the smartest books I\u2019ve ever read with content that exceeds any other that I\u2019ve ever read, seen, heard that is out there \u2013 and I have researched a lot! It was Chris\u2019 book that moved me to action because it told me \u201chow and now!\u201d I\u2019m in the middle of a business launch right now that I would probably still be sitting on had I not got my hands and eyes and brain around this hot little book!Buy the book! How is that for straightforward! I immediately started telling and texting and messaging friends to buy this book before I even finished reading it! I could not stop talking about the genius contained on the pages within. And now I\u2019m telling YOU! Had I not received an advanced copy, I would have bought this book myself and still be telling everyone about it!Share this review with anyone you know in business for themselves or thinking about starting a business and if they follow the advice\u2026 They will come back and thank you!Special thanks to Chris Guillebeau (http://chrisguillebeau.com) for the advanced copy and the opportunity to review it!Book Release Date: May 8, 2012"}, {"userName": "imane", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58826982-imane", "userReview": "\u201cCatch a man a fish, and you can sell it to him.

Recently, I had to make a couple of train trips and had plenty of time to read. So went back and finished it. It is not certainly one of those books that you can do in one sitting (see some of the other comments). I like the book since I mingle and work with lots of entrepreneurs. I think it is a must read for every entrepreneur. More than the stories, the patterns of entrepreneurship are interesting. 1. How people become entrepreneurs - some are accidental entrepreneurs (like me)2. How each entrepreneur measures success (not all of it is high growth or billions of dollars)3. How they face adversity and overcome it4. How capital really is a small part (if at all) of starting and making a successful company.5. How entrepreneurship is about something you love and really care about.It is really a collection of several small stories with some common threads. So it can be read in fragments. Stories of entrepreneurship are always fascinating and quite inspiring. It was a fun book to read and if you are an entrepreneur or someone who hangs around a lot of entrepreneurs, you may really enjoy this book.

It is not about a specific business that you can start for $100, but rather a book about a new model of doing business that the author calls a microbusiness revolution, or a way of earning a good living while crafting a life of independence and purpose.The two themes in the book are freedom and value. The author states that we are all looking for freedom and value is the way to achieve it. The book is then filled with case studies of people who have done just that. They have obtained freedom through creating value for others. While the author uses personal examples, he also uses many examples from the research he's done on people who have created businesses, with little start up costs, but provided value to others in a way that enabled them to grow the business and provide the lifestyle they desired.Make no mistake, this is not a get rich quick book. Building a business takes work, and lots of it. However, the author believes (and so do I) that you can transition to a meaningful life oriented toward something you love to do and make money doing it. Others have done it, and this book shows the path they took. The author's premise is that you can also follow this path to create the freedom you crave.The book is divided into three parts, the first, \"Unexpected Entrepreneurs\" contains five chapters that deal with Renaissance, Give Them the Fish, Follow You Passion...Maybe, The Rise of the Roaming Entrepreneur, and The New Demographics. There is some good advice in these chapters, especially in regards to figuring out what you will do, and how not everything will be a great business. Reality checking is important.Part Two, \"Taking It To The Streets\" has five chapters that deal with The One-Page Business Plan, An Offer You Can't Refuse, Launch, Hustling: The Gentle Art of Self-Promotion, and Show Me the Money. One of the things I really liked in part two was the motivation to act. Planning is important and good, but you must act. The author shares his one-page business plan worksheet.The third part, \"Leverage And Next Steps\" contains the final four chapters on Moving On Up, How to Franchise Yourself, going Long, and But What If I Fail? Again, this part has some good information for some people in certain businesses. My favorite line was at the end of the book when the author says the most important lesson in the whole book is \"Don't waste your time living someone else's life.The book also points to on-line resources to help further the guidance this book provides. Overall, I found the book motivating, and containing some valuable information for the would be entrepreneur who wants more freedom. The world is changing and the way people do business is changing. This book will help you ride the wave of that change."}, {"userName": "Youghourta", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5662959-youghourta", "userReview":

would give 3/5 to this book. Would recommend to anyone who wants to get started with startups. Caution though - there is no hardcore detailed account of step by step guide for starting your own business that will make you the next big thingOpinion: A very fresh and welcome read in the startup segment by Chris. What I loved about and what this book is definitely not compared to few other startup books that i have read is that this is not a professional scientific, clerical book on staartups which give you a picture of each startup becoming a multi-million dollar business and then gives you ways to do it which while reading excites you but, maybe not possible practically.This book starts with the basics of how to get started and in my opinion that is actually the way to get started. Imagining on the first day of starting up that your venture is gonna be facebook 2 then you are talking like my just born kid is going to be the next Usian Bolt.For a change, I was really pleased to see Chris provide stories of the startup heroes who are everyday normal people like you and me. Compared to other reading material I was happy to see that non-Harvard/Staford/Wharton/IIT/IIM people can also do it and make more then good money - that for me was the biggest driver to keep reading this book.Happy Reading.."}, {"userName": "Rosie Nguy\u1ec5n", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n", "userReview": "Phew, finished this book finally after so much time. Just because I didn't concentrate to read it.I followed Chris Guillebeau's blog a long time ago. Although I found some of his posts interesting, I was not totally impressed so I didn't care 100$ Startup when it was published.The book came to me together with a set of another 3 books from an older friend, who recommended me to read startup books. And it was amazing. I found a lot of great tips to make my upcoming second book a best seller, hehe. And many other inspirational notes and techniques which may be useful for the startup project that I'm getting involved in. I reckon Chris put a lot of hard work, a lot of research and effort in this book. And I admire his spirit. To me this is absolutely one of the must - read books in startup.

Highly recommended.This book resonated with me so well because it sells the idea of being a free soul and making a living through a small business (typically one-man). This idea of being a solopreneur, digital nomad, or whatever fancy name you call it, has been my biggest dream and drive for the last few years, and it fits very nicely with my personality.Firstly, let's discuss the flaw this book has. I think it focuses too much on the individual stories, rather than just going to the general conclusion. I understand the writer's motivation behind writing the book this way, he wanted to sound as authentic as possible by referencing examples, meanwhile following the principle of the saying \"Examples are better than precept\". But still, at times, I felt like I didn't care much about those \"Heroes of $100 Start-up\" that I would read their semi-biography.But the quality of this book that made me love it is the summarization it provided after every chapter. It focused on the core message of the book, devoid of the stories. The author also wrapped the book up with a chapter which summarizes the whole book, and I think that is really neat."}, {"userName": "Vaishali", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13209822-vaishali", "userReview": "A great review for those starting a business or in the midst of next-level expansion.Pointers:--------\"Focusing on these 2 questions will eliminate the need for outside consultants:--- Is the business making money now ?--- If not, what can we do to fix this now ?\"\"There are only 3 things you need to start a business, and there\u2019s no need to complicate this list :--- Product or service--- People willing to pay for your product or service--- A way for them to pay you\"\"Find something people want, and give it to them. Give people what they actually want, not what you think they want.\"\"If you\u2019re good at one thing, you\u2019re probably good at other things too. Transfer skills and keep learning.\"\"Sell an emotion, not product. The success of a business is directly related to how good you make them feel about themselves.\"\"Could a side-project for this business also morph into a business?\"\"Freedom is very close to value provided.\"\"Definition of value: Something desirable and of worth created thru exchange or effort.\"\"Help people. Ask: 'How can I help my customers more?' If you make your business about helping others, you\u2019ll always have plenty of work.\"\"Make your customer a hero... Help clients become Microsoft rockstars... 'Our training programs make customers look like rockstars to their friends and colleagues.' \u201d\"Sell what people buy already.\"\"Give more: love, money, acceptance, free time. Take away: stress, conflict, hassle, uncertainty.\"\"Latch onto a popular hobby, passion or craze. Anything that attracts a huge number of followers and an equally huge number of detractors (to keep the buzz going) is a good business opportunity. If interested parties love the activity but lack the discipline to implement it into their daily lives, you then have a great business opportunity.\"\"After building a loyal following, your customers will (and should) pounce on the new offering with gusto. Ask 'Will you be willing to pay for what we\u2019re offering? What\u2019s your biggest problem with \u2014-? What can I help you with \u2014-? What is the #1 thing I can do for you?\u201d\"If your mission statement is longer than this sentence, it could be too long.\"\u201cPlans are good intentions, but they immediately degenerate into hard work.\u201d - Peter Drucker\"In the battle between planning and action, action wins.\"\"Do a marketable idea, and provide a solution to a problem.

Do this quickly, so you can analyze your market better.\"\"You need to really care about this problem, and know how others care.\"\"Get the first sale as soon as possible.\"\"The problem you face is inertia.\"\"How will this business help people? What will you charge? How else will you make money from this project? How can you encourage referrals?\"\u201cI will launch this project into the world no later than (A DATE YOU STICK WITH).\"\"They gave the customers what they wanted without hiding their real lives.\"\"... a bias towards action.\"\"People follow you because that\u2019s what they\u2019re interested in : you.

If he spent all his time talking about other people and mentioning his other fans, I wouldn\u2019t be as interested. What should you talk about online? Talk about yourself and your business.\"\"You can price high if you make the value proposition extremely clear. Always make offers people cannot refuse. It should be like getting a marriage proposal from the man of your dreams. *** 1. Sell what people want to buy *** 2. Make sure you\u2019re marketing to the right people at the right time *** 3. Craft your offer into a pitch they won\u2019t turn down\"\"Most people like to buy, but don\u2019t like to be sold to.\"\"People should say about you: 'They won\u2019t let me give them my money.' Some companies brilliantly get customers to market them.\"\"Who will take immediate action on your offer? How do you get others to?\"\"Whenever you spot an inefficiency in the market, you have another business opportunity.\"\"Emergency, fast solutions will garner quick money exchanges with zero haggling.\"\u201c 'This thing is really awesome!' \u2026 is what your customers must say.' \"\"Don\u2019t be afraid.\" Offer an air-tight satisfaction guaranteed. This erases customer fears.\"\"Make people feel good about the action of paying money. Upgrade their purchase unexpectedly and immediately so that they feel good about giving money to you. Go way above their expectations.\"\u201c 'My product is a game-changer.' If you can say this, you have a great business.\"\"A good business needs nurturing and continuous improvement. As your project grows, take some time to  (1) fix little problems (2) identify small actions that will create significant results over time\"\"ALWAYS focus on the money. If you aren\u2019t making money, you don\u2019t have a good business. Period.\"\"Don\u2019t be a fire-fighter. Focus on working *on* your business as opposed to *in* it. Working on the business requires a higher-level approach.\"\"You don\u2019t need anyone to give you permission to pursue a dream.\"\"If you know what you need to do, the next step is simply to do it. Stop waiting. Start taking action.\"\"Success is the ability to keep going, to keep the doors open.\"\"Crafting an offer, hustling, and producing a launch event will generate much greater results than simply releasing your product or service to the world with no fanfare.\"\"It only gets better as you go along.\"\"You aren\u2019t alone out there.\"\"Failure is overrated\u2014who says you\u2019ll fail? You can just as easily succeed.\"\"More than competition or other external factors, the biggest battle is against our own fear and inertia.

what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick.\u00a0 Among Chris\u2019s key principles: if you\u2019re good at one thing, you\u2019re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish \u2013 sell him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins.  \u00a0 In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold.\u00a0 Today, we know that it\u2019s up to us to change our lives.\u00a0 And the best part is, if we change our own life, we can help others change theirs.\u00a0 This remarkable book will start you on your way.", "title": "The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12605157-the-100-startup", "average": 3.84, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1345666854l/12605157.jpg", "reviews": 1287, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3367145.Chris_Guillebeau", "name": "Chris Guillebeau"}], "type": ["Business", "Nonfiction", "Self Help", "Business", "Self Help"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12605157-the-100-startup", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36646569-start-nu-begin-voor-jezelf-en-maak-je-dromen-waar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26235785-100", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8978488-the-art-of-non-conformity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20170321-the-happiness-of-pursuit", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25893699-born-for-this", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33585396-side-hustle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9502368-279-days-to-overnight-success", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
