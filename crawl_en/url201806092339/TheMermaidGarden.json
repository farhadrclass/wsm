Each time one of the characters was involved in a plot twist, or each time something very REAL happened to them, my heart just ached. I cared about them so much.And even though the book ended with a typically happy ending, I didn't roll my eyes, or sigh, or close the book with a shrug; instead I almost cheered for joy, because all of the characters deserved their happy endings. These are people who probably exist in the real world. Montefiore has probably met them - or variations of them - and has given us great pleasure by transferring these wonderful souls onto paper for us to read about. I'm gushing, I know, but it was just brilliant.This one will stay with me forever."}, {"userName": "Nisareen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3694607-nisareen", "userReview": "For those of you who enjoy gentle, escapist romance, this is a great choice. This books makes you believe in the power of love and reminds you what is important in life. The novel is an extremely relaxing read with an abundance of memorable characters, beautiful destinations, mystery, intrigue and romance. I loved the descriptive detail and more than once found myself carried off to the destinations of Italy and the English coastline.The book consists of two different stories. The first story is set in Italy in the 1960's and tells of the blossoming love between Floriana, a poor village girl abandoned by her mother and left in the care of her drunkern father, and Dante, the son of one of the richest men in Italy. They first meet when Floriana, captivated by the beauty of La Magdalena, the beautiful home where Dante and his family spend their summers, is caught spying from the garden wall. He invites her over and the two become captivated by each other. Their relationship, however, faces many obstacles from the outset including the issues of a rich and prestigious man dating a poor orphan girl. The second story is set in the present day on England's Devon coast. Marina and her husband Grey own a hotel and are struggling to keep it afloat. Marina hires a resident artist, Rafael Santoro, to teach painting in the hotel during the summer to bring in business. The handsome, charismatic Rafa, arrives like a breath of fresh air and makes quite an impression on Marina and her family as well as the rest of the hotel guests but appears to be hiding a dark secret.I was constantly trying to figure out how the two stories were related at first but finally began to see where the author was coming from as more of Floriana's life was revealed. I was deeply moved by Floriana's story and fell in love her character from the onset. Her strength and courage despite adversity was at times heart wrenching and I desperately wanted her to triumph against the odds. The whole Raffles/ Baffles plot was a genuine surprise as I had suspected Rafa as being the culprit.My first introduction to this author did not disappoint and I'm looking forward to reading her next book."}, {"userName": "MomToKippy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4631503-momtokippy", "userReview": "Interesting that I picked this up to read after reading The Secret Keeper. Both stories shift back and forth between two time periods. At least in Morton's book the reader clearly understand why and can make some connections between the two story lines. However, in The House by the Sea, it appears that one is reading two different stories simultaneously. Both are good stories but until I reached the last section I could only guess at the connection. Anyway, I saw this book in a discount book store and had to read it because of the author's romantic and musical name and the promise of romance and adventure in a European seashore setting. It was a fun read and I think I will read more of her novels. This is also called The Mermaid Garden."}, {"userName": "Just\u0117", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22390083-just", "userReview": "Kokia gi vasara be keli\u0173 pasak\u0173 apie princeses su laiminga pabaiga a.k.a. lengvo turinio blevyzg\u0173.

El primer cap\u00edtulo comienza en los a\u00f1os 60's con Floriana, una peque\u00f1a ni\u00f1a italiana que es hu\u00e9rfana de madre y vive sola con su padre alcoh\u00f3lico que no se preocupa por ella. Es una ni\u00f1a solitaria, con una sola amiga. Hasta que conoce a Dante Bonfanti y se enamora de \u00e9l desde el momento en el que lo ve.Luego, damos un brinco en el tiempo y el espacio, y llegamos al Inglaterra en el a\u00f1o 2009. Nos presentan a una peculiar familia. Grey Turner, su segunda esposa Marina y sus hijos Jake y Clementine. Clementine odia a su madrastra como se debe odiar siempre a las madrastras, sin saber porqu\u00e9, s\u00f3lo porque s\u00ed. Marina, es la due\u00f1a de un peque\u00f1o hotel en la playa que ama como si fuera un hijo ya que ella no pudo tener hijos propios.As\u00ed que la historia brinca entre historias, entre tiempos y lugares. Vemos como Floriana crece, y c\u00f3mo el tiempo no mueve ni un \u00e1pice su amor no correspondido por Dante (el cual era 8 a\u00f1os mayor que ella) y cuando se fue por cinco a\u00f1os a estudiar a USA, Floriana lo esper\u00f3, porque sab\u00eda que era \u00c9L el hombre con el que alg\u00fan d\u00eda se iba a casar. Cuando Dante regresa, cinco a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s y con una Floriana mayorcita, deja de verla como la ni\u00f1a hu\u00e9rfana y sus emociones por ella se incrementan.Tambi\u00e9n vemos la lucha constante de Marina por no perder su hotel que corre peligro por la baja econom\u00eda, sus intentos de ganarse a su hijastra, y dem\u00e1s. Y es as\u00ed c\u00f3mo contrata a Rafa Santoro. Un pintor que impartir\u00e1 clases de pintura a los hu\u00e9spedes del hotel a cambio de hospedaje y alimento. Rafa logra un impacto en todos. En Marina, en los hu\u00e9spedes, pero sobre todo en Clementine.El libro me gust\u00f3 much\u00edsimo, tard\u00e9 bastante en leerlo porque la letra es muy peque\u00f1a y eso me cansa la vista, as\u00ed que no pod\u00eda avanzar mucho en un d\u00eda. Pero tal vez, el hecho de que haya tardado tanto leyendo logr\u00f3 que me adentrara al cien en la historia. Sent\u00ed que llegu\u00e9 a conocer a todos los personajes descritos entre las p\u00e1ginas. Ador\u00e9 a Floriana y su forma de verle siempre en lado positivo a la vida, aunque \u00e9sta nunca la haya tratado bien. Detest\u00e9 a Costanza, la \u00fanica amiga de Floriana por tenerle envidia y celos a una ni\u00f1a que no ten\u00eda ni la mitad que ella en su vida. M\u00e1s a\u00fan detest\u00e9 a la mam\u00e1 de Costanza. Clementine tambi\u00e9n se me hizo un personaje insufrible al principio, pero ella es el personaje que m\u00e1s desarrollo tiene en la historia, porque comienza siendo una chiquilla malcriada (a pesar de ser una joven adulta) y logramos ver un cambio dr\u00e1stico en ella a lo largo de la historia.La forma de escribir de la autora es muy bonita. Es muy descriptiva, pero no molesta. Adem\u00e1s, que a pesar de haber muchos personajes secundarios y no realmente importantes, la autora se tom\u00f3 la molestia de darle un cierre a todas las historias. No hubo ni un solo cabo suelto al finalizar de leer. Simplemente me encant\u00f3.Es una historia dulce llena de ense\u00f1anzas, de amor, de esfuerzo, y de c\u00f3mo hay que verle el lado positivo a la vida aunque \u00e9sta no se vea tan bonita desde donde estamos parados. C\u00f3mo todo pasa por algo, y c\u00f3mo todo puede estar relacionado sin uno saberlo. Lo recomiendo much\u00edsimo, especialmente ahora en verano, porque como ya dije, una parte de la historia se desarrolla en la playa, y se antoja leerlo en \u00e9stas \u00e9pocas del a\u00f1o."}, {"userName": "Aimee", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081099-aimee", "userReview": "I received this book from Goodreads Giveaways. I really enjoyed this book a lot from start to finish. It is actually two different stories in one book. The first story is of the blossoming of young love between Floriana, a poor village girl abandoned by her mother, and Dante, the son of one of the richest men in Italy. They meet when Dante finds Floriana spying on his family home, Villa La Magdalena. Floriana loves the Villa and dreams of living there and spending her time in the Mermaid Garden with her beloved Dante.  The second story is set decades later on England's Devon coast. Marina and her husband Grey own a hotel and are struggling to keep it afloat. Marina hires an artist, Rafa, to teach painting in the hotel during the summer to bring in business. Rafa, a good-looking Argentine, makes quite an impression on the town and on Marina and her familyThe Mermaid Garden is so beautifully written with details of both the Italian countryside and the English coast, it was a joy to read. Both stories were interesting and how they weave together at the end was really well done. The thing I liked the most about this book was how well so many of the characters were described. I felt I knew them so well and really cared what happened to them. There was a lot of talk about love in this book. People in love, people looking for love, and others heartbroken from it. There is an especially sweet side story of two people finding love very late in life. This books makes you believe in the power of love and reminds you what is important in life.

I am not ashamed to admit that I ate it up with a spoon. Like the Calgon commerical, it took me away from my own life and placed me in Italy in a beautiful garden, as well as the lovely Devon, England. I am a sucker for happily-ever-after if it's done well...and Santa Montefiore does it beautifully. As opposed to Calgon--yuck!

The first set in Italy, follows fragile Floriana, who was abandoned by her mother, and her journey of falling in love with Dante, the son of a prestigious family. They first meet when Floriana is captivated by the beauty of La Magdalena, the beautiful home where Dante and his family spend their summers. Their relationship faces many obstacles from the outset including the issues of a rich and prestigious man dating a poor orphan girl. The second story set in Devon England centres on Marina and her husband Grey who are trying desperately to save their hotel from financial issues. Marina comes up with the idea of hiring an artist in residence, Rafa, to try to attract more customers. The family and guests fall in love with Rafa who is hiding a deep and dark secret. The House By The Sea has everything that you could possibly want from a novel; romance, mystery, intrigue, beautiful destinations and memorable characters. It is such a beautifully written story with such descriptive detail that I found myself carried off to the destinations of Italy and the English coastline. I found the pace to be slow, which surprisingly I quite enjoyed, as it made the novel an extremely relaxing read that I wanted to delve into for hours and savour along the way. The way the novel is split into two different stories, which are intertwined although we do not find out how until the end, was really intrigued. I was constantly trying to figure out how the two stories were related and could not guess until very near the end. I enjoy when a novel leaves me guessing with the elements of mystery and suspense and The House By The Sea managed to do this beautifully while keeping me intrigued throughout. All the characters within The House By The Sea are each facing their own inner turmoil\u2019s, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading about. I felt as though this added extra depth to each character making me intrigued and sympathetic to each of them. I fell in love with Floriana who still manages to hold her head high and strive for happiness even after being abandoned by her mother. I felt her emotions throughout the novel and was willing her to get a happy ending. I also enjoyed reading about the character of Marina, who is suffering emotionally from being unable to conceive children. Once I saw underneath the rough fa\u00e7ade that she has and into her true character I was deeply moved by her. My only issue with this book was the length at almost 500 pages it is a long read. Generally I do not mind when books are of this length, however with The House By The Sea I felt that the length mixed with the slow pace of the novel worked against the storyline. This is defiantly not a book that you can read quickly instead it needs to be savoured and taken time over. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about exotic locations full of description. It is a beautifully written novel and I am very happy that I stumbled across it. This is my first Santa Montefiore novel and I cannot wait to read the next.

I absolutely adored everything about this book. Some of it is probably the beautiful imagery and the fact that I adore gardens, italian anything, and writing that grips you and keeps you guessing without ever really knowing. Only one of the many plot twists did I sort of predict correctly, and I wasn't entirely sure about it, either. I didn't really believe the back cover when it described the book as \"having it all\", but it totally does. Of course, part of a good book recommendation is knowing what kind of book a person likes to read - but if you have liked any of my other reviews, surely you'll like this book. I will definitely be reading every other book Santa Montefiore has ever written, even if they can't live up to this one. And I hope I'll read it again someday.

Me parece que su actitud no es nada atractiva, tomando en cuenta que siempre est\u00e1 preocupada porque est\u00e1n en bancarrota. No disfruta de la vida ni le ve el lado bueno a las cosas, como siempre trata de hacer su esposo Grey, quien le alegra la vida y le da la mano siempre que ella lo necesita. Hacen un buen equilibrio en su matrimonio, lo cual me hace pensar...\u00bfqu\u00e9 har\u00eda Marina sin \u00e9l?Floriana es una ni\u00f1a bastante fuerte, al igual que apasionada por vivir y disfrutar de las maravillas de la naturaleza, a pesar de que su vida no es lo que siempre quiso. Siempre trata de ocultar su resentimiento o tristeza hacia su padre, y hacia todo lo que le digan o se le cruce por la mente, alzando la barbilla y sacando pecho, desde sus diez a\u00f1os (quiz\u00e1 desde m\u00e1s joven).En cuanto a su amiga Constanza, quien tiene ra\u00edces aristocr\u00e1ticas, cuando era ni\u00f1a y se juntaba con Floriana, era una envidiosa de lo peor; como el perrito faldero de Floriana. ''Si no hace esto, pues yo tampoco''. Sin embargo, con el paso del tiempo me sorprendi\u00f3 el cambio en su forma de ser, mientras que su madre siempre iba a esforzarse por que se casara con un hombre rico y alejarla de su amiga de la infancia, Floriana (que es pobre y cree que estar con gente que no es de su clase, arruinar\u00e1 su vida), no cambia nunca. S\u00f3lo ve el lado econ\u00f3mico de la gente en beneficio para ella y los negocios.Toda la fortuna que tiene Constanza, Floriana la iguala con su personalidad, as\u00ed como pasa con todos los dem\u00e1s. Es un encanto de muchacha, y no necesita del dinero de nadie para ser tan especial. Me identifico con esta chiquilla, pues siempre tuvo esperanzas de casarse con el hijo rico de la familia Bonfanti: Dante, desde que lo conoci\u00f3 cuando ten\u00eda s\u00f3lo 10 a\u00f1os. Me recuerda a mi a\u00f1oranza por casarme con Skandar, mi amor plat\u00f3nico, cuando ten\u00eda 13 a\u00f1os, y cada vez que pasaba por una iglesia le ped\u00eda a Dios que me cumpliera eso. Lo s\u00e9... muy infantil, \u00bfno?Clementine es la hijastra de Marina, y su amargura y desagrado hacia su madrastra, podr\u00eda decirse que es bastante irritante, pero rebasa ese adjetivo. Es una muchacha malcriada y a juzgar por lo que he le\u00eddo, parece que necesitaba del amor de alguien, o su atenci\u00f3n siquiera para distraerla lo suficiente como para bajarle los humos.Est\u00e1 bastante resentida con la nueva mujer de su padre, y le echa la culpa de que sus padres no hayan vuelto, y sus d\u00edas felices se hayan evaporado a sus escasos 3 a\u00f1os de edad, mientras su padre la pasaba en grande con otra mujer que no fuese su madre. Lo siento, Clemmie, tendr\u00e1s que acostumbrarte a eso. S\u00ed, debi\u00f3 acostumbrarse, pero no lo hizo, y se deleita despreciando a Marina.En mi opini\u00f3n, Clemmie, adem\u00e1s de estar chiflada es una inmadura. Quiz\u00e1 sea dif\u00edcil superar el divorcio de sus padres, el cual marc\u00f3 su vida para mal, pero me parece incre\u00edble que no lo supere y siga adelante. Adem\u00e1s, es como si quisiera que todos pensara igual a ella, de modo rencoroso, entre otras cosas; de lo contrario, siente que est\u00e1n en su contra, o se siente...\u00bftraicionada?...\u00bfsola?''No dejes que lo que ocurri\u00f3 en el pasado controle lo que eres ahora''.Estoy segura de que no se hubiese fijado en ese argentino sino hubiese sido guapo. Lo cual significa que solo se fija en el f\u00edsico...idiota.Es una persona sumamente rencorosa, y trata de huir de los problemas. Bueno, m\u00e1s bien de s\u00ed misma y de los conflictos con su persona y su forma de reaccionar ante los acontecimientos que la vida le pone delante.En este libro nos encontramos de nuevo con la t\u00edpica chica pobre, invisible y marginada, y el gal\u00e1n, guapo, rico y popular.Desgraciadamente a Floriana le toc\u00f3 vivir en un ambiente en donde a los pobres se les discrimina por no tener dinero suficiente para comprar joyas preciosas o una mansi\u00f3n enorme con jacuzzi, criados y comida cara y en abundancia, al igual que cosas que no son vitales. Su madre la abandon\u00f3 a ella y a su padre, cuando era muy chica, llev\u00e1ndose con ella a su hermanito para huir con un se\u00f1or que vend\u00eda tomates, dejando a cargo a una inocente criatura, al cuidado de su esposo borracho. Algu inhumano, que nunca voy a comprender, y en este caso Floriana S\u00cd tiene buenas razones para sentirse rencorosa y resentida con su madre, a comparaci\u00f3n de Clementine. Contiene una escritura muy elaborada, inspiradora y apasionada. Muchos pensar\u00edan que es un libro demasiado lento por tener muchas p\u00e1ginas. Pero cr\u00e9anme, que es el \u00fanico en el que su trama me hace pensar, que as\u00ed deber\u00edan ser todos. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Pues porque se ve el esmero de la autora plasmado en las p\u00e1ginas; y aunque me hagan enojar las actitudes y formas de ser de algunos personajes y yo sea una criticona que no tiene l\u00edmites, ME GUST\u00d3.Si creen que les estoy dando spoiler, lo cierto es que yo considero spoiler, cuando relatan la trama en general, y yo estoy hablando de los personajes, describiendo algunas situaciones del libro mientras voy opinando sobre sus actitudes ante los acontecimientos, narrando todo esto siempre desde mi punto de vista. Puede que ustedes al leerlo piensen muy distinto a m\u00ed, por eso siempre recomiendo que, lean los libros que rese\u00f1o, para darse una mejor opini\u00f3n ustedes mismos.Conforme Floriana crece, junto con los dem\u00e1s personajes, su optimismo hacia el mundo alarma a sus seres queridos, ya que es excesivamente so\u00f1adora. Lo que me sorprende es que, despu\u00e9s de vivir toda su vida en la pobreza y en dificultades econ\u00f3micas, y carente de alg\u00fan familiar con sus cinco sentidos activos, ella no haya aprendido nada de lo dura que es la vida, porque a pesar de las cosas que le suced\u00edan, lo tomaba a la ligera. Supongo que se la pasaba todo el tiempo anhelando un futuro lleno de felicidad, en donde siempre estar\u00eda con su amado Dante. A veces me daban ganas de darle una bofetada por ser tan ingenua e inocente, pero luego recordaba que ella no tuvo una madre que la aconsejara sobre la vida, y se me pasa. LITERAL. La finalidad de esta historia, desde mi punto de vista, es dejar ir el pasado y caminar hacia el futuro. Enganchar todos esos rencores y resentimientos, para aceptar las cosas como son, siempre considerando ambas caras de la moneda. A veces es muy importante explorar cada \u00e1ngulo de las situaciones que nos angustian, que son una piedra en el camino, que debemos remover para avanzar como ser humano y sentirte...alguien nuevo y renovado.Nos revela la belleza de la naturaleza, la tranquilidad que estos le brindan al ser humano.Se trata de seguir adelante.El amor de verano, estamos acostumbrados a interpretarlo como algo pasajero, pero marcaron la vida de una ni\u00f1a enamorada y so\u00f1adora, que miraba el mundo con inocencia y desde perspectivas que nos gustar\u00eda contemplar a muchos.Y todas estas son mis conclusiones, junto con el hecho de que la calidez hogare\u00f1a del amor derrite el hielo del coraz\u00f3n.''La mayor parte del tiempo vamos por la vida a toda prisa, con los ojos cerrados, absortos en un sinf\u00edn de pensamientos. Nos perdemos la magia sencilla de un bot\u00f3n de oro escondido entre la hierba. Ahora puedes detenerte de verdad y mirar a tu alrededor con los ojos abiertos de par en par y gozar de la belleza de la naturaleza. Puedes existir plenamente en el presente''.El final me dej\u00f3 pasmada, y s\u00ed, podr\u00eda decirse que PLENAMENTE PASMADA ante el giro inesperado de los hechos. Me siento tan feliz y agradecida con la editorial, porque me est\u00e1 brincando la oportunidad de conocer estas maravillosas historias.Sobre Dante y Rafa no tengo mucho que decir, excepto que Rafa es la perfecta encarnaci\u00f3n de la madurez y comprensi\u00f3n, mientras que Dante me recuerda a mi amor plat\u00f3nico, y... \u00a1AAAA!Ver\u00e1n que a lo largo de los meses, algunas rese\u00f1as son menos extensas, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n un poco menos apasionadas, pues no todos los libros van a gustarme tanto como otros. Algunos opinan que es dif\u00edcil colaborar con editoriales. Y en efecto, es dif\u00edcil cuando no tienes tiempo y pides muchos libros y colaboras con muchas. No me cuesta nada tomar un poquito de tiempo escribiendo mi opini\u00f3n sobre el desenlace de un libro, porque me gusta y me siento a gusto haci\u00e9ndolo y es un placer para m\u00ed estar aqu\u00ed. Este libro nos da mucho en que pensar y hace reflexionar sobre las dificultades de la vida. - Ver rese\u00f1a en: http://betweencitylights.blogspot.mx/..."}, {"userName": "Oda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4575782-oda", "userReview": "Wow, this sucked harder than I thought possible!

She has unlimited freedom to explore, and as she is looking over the wall of a villa that she likes to visit, she meets a boy named Dante, whose family owns the villa. He invites her in to explore the garden, and they become friends. She even falls in love with him a little bit, despite the fact that she is only 10 and he is a teenager going off to school at the end of the summer. We follow her and her friend Costanza, whose mother only allows her to play with Floriana because there are no \"children of quality\" for her to play with, through the following summers as they both become frequent visitors to the villa.The present: Marina and Grey Turner run the Polzanze Hotel. One of Marina's sorrows is that she has no children of her own, and her stepchildren, especially Grey's 23-year-old daughter Clementine, don't treat her as a mother, even though she has been in their lives since they were very small children. In fact, Clementine is bitter, resentful, and selfish, lamenting the fact that she is no longer free to travel and \"find herself\", because she now has to work and make her own living.When Marina decides to bring in an \"artist-in-residence\" to help the failing fortunes of the hotel, both past and present will come together.I loved the writing style of this novel. The prose was very descriptive and the emotions and character-development were spot on. As usual for me, I liked the story set in the past a bit better :). There were, however, a few things that didn't ring true for me, and they are the reason this is not a five-star rating. Clementine - well, there's no way that you can go from being a spoiled, selfish, grown-up brat overnight to an understanding and loving person the next day. It just doesn't happen like that. Her romance also wasn't fully-formed and fleshed-out; it came up lacking in my view. BUT, those were the only sticking points for me, as the book kept me interested from start to finish. I was able to figure out early on what the mystery/secret would be, but that didn't keep me from wanting to know how it would all come out in the end. A gorgeous read.QUOTE (from a galley; may be different in final copy): Marina's good mood evaporated as Clementine sucked the air out of the room, replacing it with her dark presence. She glanced at her husband and felt nothing but contempt for her stepdaughter, who constantly rebuffed him."}, {"userName": "Shaz Goodwin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4422203-shaz-goodwin", "userReview": "This is a love story that is beautifully written. I was able to imagine myself in Tuscany and in Devon, living alongside the characters as I watched the story unfold.The prologue sets the scene. In Tuscany, Floriana and Dante meet. Floriana is a 10 year old whose mother has run away with her younger brother and left her with her alcoholic father. Dante is a few years older, the son of a high profile industrialist who may have connections with the Mafia.We\u2019re then taken to Devon in 2009 where hotel owner Marina and husband Grey are trying desperately to bring in money to save the hotel from being taken over. Grey\u2019s twenty-three year old daughter from his previous marriage, Clementine, has never accepted Marina. His son Jake is the Manager of the hotel. From the moment Rafa (artist-in-residence) arrives, changes start to happen. Rafa is a very intense and intuitive man. I think he is the hero we would all like to have in our lives!In Tuscany we find out how class distinctions rule the characters lives and in Devon we find out more about Marina and her emotional outbursts. Eventually the two worlds come together and all the lose ends are tied up beautifully.Until near the end, we never know for sure the link between Tuscany and Devon. At times I was sure I had the correct connection but then a hint would be dropped that would take me away from that. Very clever.In Devon, there are references in the story of a burglar, nicknamed Baffles, who leaves a thank you note in place of the possessions that are taken. At one point there is a mistaken identity and the police interrupt a scene that was hilarious \u2013 I\u2019m still laughing as I type. I have to admit to being surprised when we eventually do find out the burglars identity, although in retrospect it fits perfectly!At one point in the story we leave Tuscany with stray dog Dead-Night as the last \u2018picture\u2019 we see and we are brought back to Devon with the stray dog Biscuit jumping on Rafa to wake him up. I loved that.The writing is beautiful. My poetic heart loved lines like \u2018The stars were clearer than ever before, twinkling like shiny new memories \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019.There was only in one part where I was disappointed. Florania\u2019s response to knowing a family member had died was to say \u2018I keep all the press cuttings about your family \u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2019 but she asks if he married. If she looked out for and kept all the press cuttings then she would have known the answer\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. This is a fabulous story of family relationships, friendships and love on many levels that kept me gripped until the end. I\u2019ve laughed and I\u2019ve cried.I would like to thank Simon & Schuster UK for sending me an uncorrected proof copy to review."}, {"userName": "Fluffychick", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1922314-fluffychick", "userReview": "Ten year old Floriana, an Italian urchin, abandoned by her mother and left to care for her alcoholic father, falls in love with the gardens of the Villa La Magdalena and the owner's son, Dante. Convinced it's her destiny to marry Dante and to live happily ever after in the beautiful villa, she ignores the difficulties of money, class and Dante's dangerous father.Forty years later, Marina and her husband Grey run a luxury hotel on the coast of Devon, but face financial and familial difficulties. Marina is relying on finding a resident artist to boost their income, but this seems unlikely until the charismatic, Argentine Rafa Santoro appears. He sweeps in and makes everything appear better, but is he all he appears?I have a bit of strange relationship with Santa Montefiore's books...some are fabulous, I sobbed at the end of \"Forget-me-not Sonata\" but others have been disappointing. I keep buying hoping each new one will live up to my expectations...and this one, nearly did!The dual stories of Floriana in Tuscany, forty years ago and the present day tribulations of Marina in Devon eventually weave together. Maybe I read too many books along similar lines or am just familiar with the recurring themes in Montefiore's books, but I knew straight away where it was going and how Rafa fitted in. I thought far too many clues were dropped when he first arrives at the hotel and so I dropped a star for being predictable! However, it is beautifully written, particularly the Italian setting and I did want to go along with the ride.The Italian story was interesting and I got a bit frustrated when it was stopped by the modern day, whinging Clemetine. Floriana's combination of toughness and idealism was understandable and engaging; I thought Dante a bit two-dimensional, but his weaknesses drives the plot.Rafa is almost a \"fairy-godfather\" character! He's too good to be true, but not in a bad way, I still loved him...gorgeous, wise, genuine...he comes in and spreads his fairy dust on everything and everyone, even the self-centred and spoilt Clementine. Now this was a bit of a problem for me!! I truly disliked Clementine, all the way through, even when she tried to redeem herself. It may be simplistic but I like characters to \"earn\" their happy ending and Clementine (for me!) came nowhere near!! The whole Raffles/ Baffles plot was a red herring and I thought other parts of the book could have been further developed if it had been dropped.However, it's a really pleasant wallow that takes you to another place and I did enjoy it, so although not one (only in my opinion) of her greatest, certainly worth looking at."}, {"userName": "Branwen Sedai *of the White Ajah*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701086-branwen-sedai-of-the-white-ajah", "userReview": "\"I have to be near the sea.

I really enjoyed it, quite honestly more than I expected to. I picked it up at the beginning of the month because I sometimes think its a good idea to stray away from my usual path of fantasy/scifi/young adult reads and try something different. This is a contemporary romance, which is a type of book I usually stay away from. But despite that, I really loved this story. So if it was enough to make me break all my genre barriers you KNOW that it was a good story. :) What I liked best of this book was the absolutely breathtaking descriptions of the various places, namely Tuscany and the Devon Coast. The words almost melt off the pages with vibrancy and beauty. I could almost taste the food they ate, smelled the air they breathed, lived the lives they lived. The writing is spectacular. I found the characters very intriguing as well. They were not flat or two-dimensional at all. They were all so interesting and had such great failings and triumphs that you couldn't help but root for them and hope that they could all find happiness. And the transformations they all went through were spectacular to behold.I would recommend this book to anyone, even if they don't care much for this particular genre.

I bought it on a whim. Honestly the two reasons I bought it were because it had \"mermaid\" in the title and it took place in Italy. I followed my gut and it paid off.After reading some other reviews I have to disagree with the majority of the people who are saying that the whiny girl (Clementine) should not have gotten her way at the end and its so typical for the spoiled brat to end up happy. I don't believe that it how it happened at all. Have you never heard of character development? Clementine went from being a unhappy, spoiled, unappreciative girl to a grateful, young woman in the end. Her relationship with Marina was rocky to say the least but by the end they had put a start to mending things. We as humans are very selfish and there isn't one of us who doesn't think they deserve the world. Clementine went out there and took it herself, learning the ways from Grey, Rafa, Sophia, and even Marina. It was a beautiful story and that wasn't even the main plot....Dante and Floriana. Wow. Could young love be any more perfect? This is what young girls all wish for when they meet their first crush. The outcome of their relationship was not surprising but still turned up some pretty raw emotions inside me when I read it. I had a few inklings about how the story would end and some were right, but most were wrong. That is what was so great about this book. Montefiore gave you what you wanted but not in the way you expected. I was very surprised by how emotional I got when I was reading this novel. I didn't think a romance could do that to me. I can't wait to read another one of Santa's books!"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1951999-susan", "userReview": "Here's the trick for me in rating this book at the moment: this novel is totally and completely \"chick lit,\" and that's just not what I'm into at the moment. So for that reason, it didn't entirely appeal to me. But my sister practically glowed when she talked about it, and I've long said that I'll read pretty much anything that someone tells me is outstanding. I've got to say, within its genre, this rocks.Which made me thing about the genre. What makes \"chick lit\" BE \"chick lit\"? Here's what I came up with: the WHOLE thing is about relationships. If you took out the relationships, there is essentially no story left. That's not a bad thing, it's just a defining thing. And those relationships don't have to be romances, although there is often at least one budding romantic element in these books. But there are also friendships, parent/child relationships, longstanding hatreds, established marriages, and more.This novel hits them all, and I have to say, it does it beautifully. It also tells the story using the fairly common device of telling what appear to be two different stories from two different times in history, and only far into the book do you figure out how the two pieces come together. Again, it was done beautifully.So if chick lit is your thing, or you are looking for a lighter read as the holidays approach, or you know someone who does like this genre, this was a great one. My sister was right.
