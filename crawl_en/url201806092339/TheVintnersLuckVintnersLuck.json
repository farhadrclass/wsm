What connection, if any, is there between the angel\u2019s annual appearance and the success of each year\u2019s vintage? What can the man make of the angel\u2019s matter-of-fact telling of wildly incredible stories of heaven and hell? And, perhaps most important, what horrible things would be necessary for this angel to be more worldly because of his love for the man?This book affected me deeply. For me, it falls somewhere between fantasy and allegory, tending toward the latter. The quiet, even voice somehow manages to evoke powerful response -- think \"still waters run deep\".

Our English curriculum makes it compulsory for us to do a reading log for every English class, covering a variety of books. In order to support our local heritage the log needs to include at least one book by a local NZ author each year. Shouldn't be too hard, right? We produced Joy Cowley, Maurice Gee, Katherine Mansfield, Phillip Mann and Witi Ihimaera. Shouldn't be too hard at all.Except for one problem, of course. I loved the Shadrach books, and of course I'd read Whale Rider. The Doll's House and Mrs Brill are two of my favourite short stories by local authors. The real trouble, however, was with my inability to find a local author whose work became 'a book I liked' rather than 'a book by an NZ author that I liked'. Note that I say Mansfield's short stories are only among my favourite locally-written stories. I spent years looking for a book written by someone locally which I could rank right up with my 'books I love regardless of the author's nation of origin'. To love an author regardless of any sense of Kiwi loyalty would be nice.So rewind a little to sixth-form English class. Ms. Titter (yes, that was her real name, and yes, she had breasts worthy of her name) sends me off to the library during class because my 'local author' segment for my reading log is blank. I trudge down reluctantly, having used up a majority of my stock reviews for the log in earlier years (one can only review so many Joy Cowley books as a young adult, trust me). About two minutes into my search and I decide, in the way I always did until I hit Uni and had to be responsible for myself, that I can't be bothered. So I procrastinate. Casually, I stroll down to the 'K's and decide to flick through a King volume until the bell goes. I'm looking, looking... Nothing. Ah f--Hang on, what's this? It's a beautiful spine of silver with a lovely red font, subtle and clean, eye-catching in its simplicity. Oh hey, beautiful. Wanna come home with me?I pick the book out of the tightly packed-shelf. It has a black koru mark on the cover under the school library logo, indicating that it's by a local author. Score! The cover is smooth and cool to the touch. I turn to the back cover, expecting a story based in NZ or with some NZ influence, as I often find this is what local authors tend to write about. Imagine my surprise when I see nothing but praise for the book, something I've never seen on a NZ book cover before. Praise from the U.K. Times, praise from Entertainment Weekly, praise from Independent Sunday...Hang on. Really? Well alright then. Hey beautiful. You're coming home with me.\"1808 Vin bourru (new wine)A week after midsummer, when the festival fires were cold, and decent people were in bed an hour after sunset, not lying dry-mouthed in dark rooms at midday, a young man named Sobran Jodeau stole two of the freshly bottled wines to baptise the first real sorrow of his life.\"Oh hel-lo, beautiful. I think we'll get along just fine.I firmly believe in one thing above all else; a book's opening page, and especially that crucial opening sentence, can make or break it for the reader. That single line there *points* shows how this book is going to turn out from the get-go. Every sentence in this book is just that beautiful, with each word treated with the respect it deserves as it is carefully placed within the sentence and woven into the story. There's a subtlety that's indicated in the cover, yes, but also a tenderness, a sense of kinship and a persistent underlying feeling of secrets waiting to be told. That sentence promises the world, and the story delivers.Not only did it pique my curiosity as to what Sobran's issue was, it's also very indicative of Sobran's behaviour and personality. He's stubborn, so he does what he wants. He's simple, but self-aware. He's young, he feels too much and he's got a lot to learn.\"Someone had set a statue down on the ridge. Sobran blinked and swayed. For a second he saw what he knew - gilt, paint and varnish, the sculpted labial eyes of a church statue. Then he swooned while still walking forward, and the angel stood quickly to catch him.\"For a book that hinges on poetic, the stark abruptness of that reveal is odd, startling, much like Xas himself.\"'God help you,' Xas said, with feeling.\"Please, go ahead. It's perfectly fine. I didn't need my heart anyway. Go ahead, take what you want.I should have known that I'd love him anyway, because he reads. I have such a hideous, awful weakness for anyone who loves to read, enough so to spend his spare time creating a library. He's happy, \"so long as the books keep appearing\".\"They stopped under Jacob Wrestles with an Angel.'Which angel was it?' Sobran asked, looking up at the capital. Xas could always be distracted by a question.'That was Yahweh, I think,' Xas said, 'being obtuse.'\"His curiosity is wonderful. Xas is like a child in that way, he's seen the world but he still feels ignorant, he's still surprised by the little things and he's constantly thirsting to learn more about people, about life, about religion, about humanity, about himself and about everything. He's sweet, he's kind, he's confused, he's careless, he's indecisive, he's innocent in the face of expectation... He's perfect. He's perfect, from beginning to bittersweet end, and even the sequel can't destroy him.\"Aurora felt she had come to her own execution. She looked around for an avenue of escape. The surgeon stood over her. He had no colour in his face. She didn't want to watch as he laid out the knives. Someone draped a cloth over her face. She was dead already.\"Aurora is utterly magnificent. In 19th century Europe, she's well-read despite being a woman. She handles the estate, the vineyards and her father's business. She's unafraid to criticise, she's exhaustingly curious and she won't think twice before being honest. She doesn't let her marriage define her, she gives her children a chance to think for themselves and she supports her friends with an unfailing sense of loyalty. She's pretty much a woman completely out of her time, and she'd be out of character if she weren't hindered by the customs and restrictions that her time-period and society place on her. It's the fact that she tries to work around it despite the overwhelming expectations that makes her so admirable. I wish I were half the woman she is.\"'I'm sorry, Sobran.'\"Then there's L\u00e9on, C\u00e9leste, Paul, Baptiste, Bernard, Antoine... The book is rich with varied characters and an ever-changing storyline. It's about Sobran's life, more than anything else, and the impact Xas has on it. So of course the story changes a bit, because life is full of changes and surprises. It's endlessly fascinating and written so beautifully that it makes me ache.When I finished this, I cried. I still cry every time I read it. It's beautifully written, carefully thought-out and so full of emotion that it's hard not to fall in love, even if you know you shouldn't.\"Sobran caught the angel's hands and held them. 'I've found you,' he said, then, 'I have an idea. Listen.'\"It took me several years, but I found a story that I loved regardless of the author. Go figure. I read the library copy and bought my own the very next day. I then read that one until it fell to pieces. My second copy ended much the same way. My third, so far, is faring better, but if it falls apart I'll be buying it again. No amount of money in the world will balance out my love for this.\"You fainted and I caught you. It was the first time I'd supported a human. You had such heavy bones. I put myself between you and gravity. Impossible.\"If you haven't read this, I can fix that. I'm hosting a giveaway here. If you want a copy of this book, well, here you go. I have three to give away.Giveaway closed.

This book is heartbreaking, but in the most beautiful, profound way possible.At its simplest it's a book about a vinemaker, Sobran, and his relationship with an angel, Xas, he was fortunate enough to stumble upon one night, while looking for relief from heartbreak. A relationship that ends up defining both their lives, and hugely impacts the life of everyone else around them.And this is why it is in no way a simple book, and never will be. It is a love story, yes, and a grand one at that, but it is so much more. It is very much also about how we each handle the events thrown our way. How we choose to deal with loss, betrayal, lust, passion, lies and faith. Faith most of all. Faith in God, ourselves, each other, in circumstance. Elizabeth Knox has a way with words. Her descriptions, thoughts and characters seem as real as anything I've ever seen with my own eyes. Something I particularly enjoyed, although it frustrated me at first, is how half the story is not written. It takes place outside the paper, in a place the reader can't see, only imagine, and many big events are never described, simply hinted at. That led me to pay closer to attention to the events that played out on the paper before me, because I knew they had to be important, had to mean something, since they made it to the book in such detail, while others were left out. I cannot describe what I believe this book is about, because the truth is I don't know. This book has left me with more of a feeling. It's not something I can explain, really, I just know that for a time being I will feel as if Sobran, Xas and this story is more important than anything else in my life. All I know is this; I won't forget it. I intend to read this book again, and then a few times after that, just to make sure I understood it all (I never do), and because as long as I keep reading, they don't have to spend an eternity apart, they don't ever really have to say goodbye."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "My flatmate recommended this to me with much high praise. And read my copy before I got my hands on it, and cried at it a lot. I have to confess, when I started reading it, I didn't really get into it. The story is about a man who agrees to meet an angel (or an angel who agrees to meet a man?) at the same time every year, for one night every year. The story focuses on these meetings, so what we get are glimpses into a life. It isn't just the meetings, but it focuses mostly on them, rather than the minutiae of daily life. As a consequence, it takes time to get to know the characters. I think it was that that kept me from getting too deeply into the story.It actually reminds me of a line from the first page: He took a swig of the friand, tasted fruit and freshness, a flavour that turned briefly and looked back over its shoulder at the summer before last, but didn't pause even to shade its eyes. And then: Again he tasted the wine's quick backward look, its spice -- flirtation and not love.Not only is that a lovely thought, and it tastes nice to synaesthetic little me, but it kind of describes how I felt about the book at first.I didn't really know what to expect from the story. There's a little mystery in it, about some murders that happen in the area, and then there's the love story between the man and the angel. I found both of them compelling. There are also glimpses into heaven and hell, provided by Xas, the angel, and the intervention of Lucifer -- things that really point at a greater plot, I suppose, but we see it framed in the same way as Sobran, the human, does.The writing is also nice. It probably wouldn't surprise you to know that this book tasted, as a whole, like wine, but it wasn't always the same kind of wine. I didn't read that much of the book aloud, actually, but it was still strongly synaesthetic for me. (I can't imagine books without synaesthesia. You'll have to pardon me always explaining books in synaesthetic terms: sometimes, there are no others.)The love story is the part that really captured me, I have to say. It isn't easy, Xas holding back from it, and then Sobran becoming angry and not wanting to see Xas, and then Xas' disappearance... There's enough of it to catch hold of your heart, though, and when you're reaching the end of the book, it really, really begins to hurt.I didn't actually cry, although it was a close thing: I was desperate to read the last twenty pages, so had to read them under my grandparents' eagle eyes, and that wasn't conducive to a full-on sob fest...I really do love the last lines:You fainted and I caught you. It was the first time I'd supported a human. You had such heavy bones. I put myself between you and gravity.Impossible."}, {"userName": "effie", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3885796-effie", "userReview": "tl;dr SUMMARY VERSION: In The Vintner\u2019s Luck, Book, I recommend an awesome concept, some interesting if distant characters, ~tragic gay angel love~, some thought-provoking religious mythology, some effective poetic language (infinite descriptions of wing movements, dead leaves, the Napoleonic Wars), a fast read, refreshing anti-agism (old people having sex! THE SCANDAL). I caution against somewhat distant, unlikeable characters (and a massive cast), somewhat anticlimactic gay angel sex, some Twilight-style purple prose, and a nagging sense that this could have been so much more. For fans of: gay angel fanfiction, metaphors, interspecies romance, character studies, gossip, gay angels whose names rhyme with \u201class\u201d, winemakingOKAY SO HERE\u2019S THE DEAL: I kind of liked this book. I kind of liked the movie. I disliked them, and liked them, for entirely different reasons, which makes sense because they are not remotely the same story. This turns out to be deeply unfortunate, because expecting one to be anything like the other only leads to disappointment (and disgruntlement, what with all the IF ONLYs). The Vintner\u2019s Luck, the book, is an extended metaphor on copies and symmetry as a French peasant and an angel fall in love and tangle with both the grand mythologies of Heaven and Hell and the domestic dramas of a small village (amid approximately a bajillion characters and subplots including marriages, re-marriages, murders, scholarship, wine-making, cancer, erotic asphyxiation, childbirth, and botany). The entire thing revolves around the ups, downs, and slooooow development of this relationship and its resulting consequences. (The Vintner\u2019s Luck, the movie, is a lovingly-documented homage to wine-making in the French countryside as a peasant dude named Sobran has lots of wine and children and sex with his hot wife and a wine-tasting widowed baroness. Oh, and every so often the dude talks to an angel with the face of Gaspard Ulliel for like three minutes...I have a whoooole separate essay on that thing but anyway). NITTY-GRITTY BOOK REVIEW MOMENTS: What the Sam Hill is this style. What. It is literally Metaphorception; SIMILE WITHIN METAPHOR WITHIN SIMILE! IN A METAPHOR! GREAT GOOGLY WOMAN JUST SAY SOMETHING OUTRIGHT FOR ONE SENTENCE JFCSo you stumble through the frankly atrocious bogs of metaphor in the first third of the novel, going Someday this will be rewarded by gay angel sex. Someday. If that be what you seek, reader, you best go get yo\u2019self some Anne Rice instead. Knox reads like a sort of neo-Rice, with all the heaving, extended clauses and hyperbole, but more awkward and less sensually dreamy. Sample quote: \u201cRich men would pay fortunes for even one ounce of the angel\u2019s spit. His every secretion a potent love potion, sweet-scented, innocent as snow, fresh after days in the warmth, the proved yeast of greasy sheets.\u201d Uh, what? Not sexy. Also, \u2018potent love potion\u2019? \u2018Innocent as snow\u2019? I have read fanfiction less cringeworthy. Xas is far and away the most interesting thing happening here \u2013 you can never quite get a read on Sobran the winemaker (Is he likable? Not sure. Relatable? Not sure\u2026), the idea of his Baroness ladyfriend turns out to be more awesome than how she\u2019s written (she could have been fleshed out into a serious badass), and his wife is just off on the sidelines being crazy. Xas\u2019 injury, mutilation, and difficult transformative recovery are definitely the book\u2019s high point (What can I say, I like my gay angels bloody). Not to be spoiler queen, but Lucifer shows up and gets shit done, Aurora the baroness cancer survivor figures shit out, and Knox creates a wonderfully creepy atmosphere when literally all sorts of shit starts dying supernaturally. If only Xas could have been pretty and dying and Sobran in a heartbreak coma ALL the time! Some parts were creative (his things about walls! Of course! his thing about distances! Of course!).Some part were engaging (I THINK MY DAD IS SLEEPING WITH MY INSANELY HOT \u2018TUTOR FROM IRELAND\u2019 DUN DUN DUNNN\u2019), Some parts were lyrically, poetically lovely (\"Despair is gravity. What an appetite it has, hotter than hellfire. \"Here, let me have you,\" it says.\" Combined with the epigraph and the final paragraph - whoa amazing.)...but just some. Which is unbelievably annoying, because if you showed me those three moments about gravity and told me they came from a French peasant and an angel in love UGH MY HEART OH MY GOD FEELINGS. and yet somehow in context of what she does it's just like...oh, hm, that was pretty. Also, Knox has like 45 balls in the air at once. Sobran has like 25 children; I could not keep them straight to save my life. Then they all got married and had more children, and I was just like WHAT THE FUCK ARE ALL THESE FRENCH NAMES WHO ARE YOUThe standout characters (in both book and movie) are those with the least screentime \u2013 in the movie, fatally, Xas is pretty and interesting and a flitting afterthought; in the book he\u2019s so distant as to be unrelatable and the book\u2019s most engaging moments almost all revolve around Lucifer\u2019s badass appearance. Frustratingly, I felt much more interested in him than the angel we\u2019d spent the last 200 pages on, and felt I knew him better, and I liked him more. LUCI COME BACKAnyway, if I spent two hours watching this movie and three hours reading this book and an hour writing this, SOMETHING engaging was going on \u2013 but I\u2019m afraid it might be that the concept of both is imaginative and cool and romantic (French peasant spends one night a year falling in love with an angel in his 1815 vineyard, I mean THAT IS A GOOD ONE) and then both mediums almost completely fail to capitalize. SIIIIIIIGH."}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283153-mo", "userReview": "Deceptively simple story of the relationship between a fallen angel and a French vintner across a lifetime. Superficially, there are some aspects of the book I didn't like - the characterization is a bit weak and parts of it tend towards melodrama. However, there's so much going on under the surface: the way that Sobran's life is shown to parallel the making of a wine, the theme of symmetry/duplication, Xas' relationship with Christ, the way the divine interacts with the natural. Xas' single annual visit overshadows everything else that happens to Sobran during the year; when Xas nearly dies, he sucks the life out of nearby organisms to heal; copies of things and people end up in Heaven or Hell after they are destroyed. There's a pattern here - this book depicts God and the Devil as parasitic, poaching ideas and vitality from the human world. But this \"fearful symmetry\" of God's souls in Heaven lacks the true individuality that can only be gained by real experience. Niall's soul isn't Niall, it's a distillation - like wine is the distillation of the earth and sun and plants and labor that went into it, not the things themselves, only a reminder, a \"backward glance.\" Xas, the preemptive copy of Christ, goes to Earth, where he experiences the reality of these things - sensuality, sin, death, life. Unlike Christ, he doesn't get to return to Heaven after his ordeal (the mutilation of his wings). Note also the significance of their first meeting - Xas catches the falling Sobran, an event which then comes up in the closing narration. \"It was the first time I'd supported a human. You had such heavy bones. I put myself between you and gravity. Impossible.\" It occurred to me that this might function as a reference to the Biblical Fall of Man, which Christ's sacrifice was supposed to redeem. In this version, there is no redemption (it's \"impossible\" to save a human from falling/gravity), and it's Xas who falls, sins, and lives. Plus there's the hot-half-naked-angel-on-handsome-Frenchman action. You know you want to get on that."}, {"userName": "Chris Horsefield", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14058695-chris-horsefield", "userReview": "The way each book deals with issues of structure, chronology, plotting, characterisation, and, of course, theology, are radically different to what I expected.THE VINTNER'S LUCK should stand (and fall) on its own merits. But if comparisons must be drawn, one might look at how Neil Gaiman characterizes religious mythology in his fiction. Heaven and Hell are made real, as are Lucifer, God, and a host of angels, all given motivations and decisions to make.This would all work out pretty well, but Knox chooses an intuitively obvious structure for conveying her plot: one chapter for each year that takes place. This makes sense, except that the angel and the vintner engage in lovers spats. It draws the events of the novel out longer than necessary. Knox cheats the structure a couple of times as well, when it suits her to draw chapter endings in more conventionally dramatic fashion.We're allowed to see the life of the vintner, but the experiences of the angel are related to us by him, in small bursts. Thus, we are given portraits only of secondary characters in the vintner's life. Of those, only his friend and employer, the Baroness, is vividly painted. For that matter, the vintner's character is muddled, as the themes of the book are played out within him.Ultimately, THE VINTNER'S LUNK is an interestingly imagined tale, but doesn't always handle its characters and plotting well in order to present a cohesive end-product.

But, The Vintner's Luck being as criminally unknown as it is, only readily available in its nation of origin (New Zealand), I feel I have to make a case for its beauty and sheer energy that kept me turning the pages.Well, maybe not turning the pages as quickly as I could. I would read ten to twenty pages at a time and need some time to gather my feelings and think carefully upon what I had just read. If that makes any sense.Now, some of you may be going: \"Vanessa, how on Earth could you call this novel 'criminally unknown'? A film starring Gaspard Ulliel, the handsome Frenchman from Hannibal Rising, and Keisha Castle-Hughes from Whale Rider (and its same director) was released in 2009!\" Well, the film was critically panned by everybody who saw its first screening at a Toronto film festival, and the author herself said the film missed the point of her novel so badly it made her cry. Certainly not an accolade to be proud of, in any case.Read the book. It is probably a lot better than the movie - which I haven't gotten around to seeing yet. The book covers so many more themes, and it really made me think on a spiritual level from time to time. I really loved how whenever Xas (the angel in the story) is around, the writing takes on a hushed, religious tone. Elizabeth Knox is also one of these rare authors who can seriously deliver literary punches to the gut. Characters die at the tip of a hat. Alliances are broken. Secrets are revealed. Each and every time this happened, I felt so horribly shaken up. Also, this is the first book I've read where I nearly let out a wail of pain in my workplace while reading a particular part of the story.I had to doff my cap to this book \u2013 it actually gets angel mythology. I have read so many awful books in my short existence which try to figure in angels, or their fallen brethren, and while it works absolutely splendidly here and in Susan Ee's Angelfall, and Kaori Yuki's Angel Sanctuary, it was soul-crushingly awful in Lauren Kate's Fallen and Becca Fitzpatrick's Hush, Hush series. Don't even get me started on Alexandra Adornetto's Halo series...Xas is one of the best-written angel characters I have ever read. He's aloof from mankind, yet compassionate. He's well-read, but wants to learn more about this world. He's supposedly a holy, flawless creature whose mere presence commands authority, but he doubts himself. In short, everything you'd expect an angel to be like. Not Adornetto's sappy heroine, or Fitzpatrick's repulsive supernatural love interest.The story takes place in Napoleonic France, throughout the life of a vintner named Sobran Jodeau. He meets with an angel named Xas, and they make a deal: Xas will pay Sobran a visit once a year. It's an unusual friendship, but it blossoms over the years, has its fair share of setbacks (including a heartbreaking thirty or so pages during which Sobran becomes incredibly pious and refuses to see Xas at all), and also its fair share of positives, as Xas and Sobran wind up falling more and more in love with each other.Of course, this book isn't just about Xas The Awesome Angel\u2122. Sobran faces problems with his family, his social circle, his romantic life, and his own conscience as he falls more and more for the poor angel who he can't love and who can't love him back and... sob sob sob.I apologise for talking about Alexandra Adornetto's Halo series again, but I feel I must in order to make a point. While holier-than-thou angel Bethany is allowed to flounce around, leaving chaos in her and her true love's wake, she never seems to suffer any repercussions for it. She was reprimanded by the council of archangels in the first book for merely hugging her (human) boyfriend, yet everything else seems perfectly fine. From what I have heard of the third book, she manages to get married to aforementioned human boyfriend, and gets away with it scot-free. All Heaven does is... jiggle the ground a little bit and kill some innocent people in a passive-aggressive gesture. All while Bethany just smiles, makes a stupid comment, and looks adoringly into Xavier's walnut-almond-nutmeg-cinnamon-hazelnut eyes. Blech.What does the Archangel Michael do to Xas when he falls in love with a human?Waits for him to come out of one of Heaven's weak spots, then beats the living tar out of him. Xas' side, and part of his wing is also blistered and burned. Yeah. Even more horrible is that it gets worse later on in the book, a moment which nearly made me cry with how unfair it was to poor Xas.My only real complaint about this book is that it meandered quite a lot over the last 40 or so pages, and there were parts where my interest was beginning to wane...However, it is definitely one of the best books I have ever read, and one I very much look forward to returning to some day. If you want a truly beautiful romance between a human and an angel that will really make you think, you couldn't go wrong with The Vintner's Luck.

He stumbles out into the fields and when he passes out, he is caught by an angel before he hits the ground. The very first chapter was intriguing. It made me eager to find out why the angel was there in the first place, and who or what was in the whirlwind that made him suddenly stand at attention and promise to meet Sobran once a year on the same date and in the same place. He had been reluctant to agree to the meetings until that whirlwind came along. Why?But as each year's meeting is described, I began to lose interest in that puzzle and in Sobran's world, and I couldn't make myself keep reading.

Sobran fell against a warm, firm pillow of muscle. He lay braced by a wing, pure sinew and bone under a cushion of feathers. This is Sobran and Xas' first meeting. Sobran, the son of a vintner in the early 19th century, is drowning his sorrows in wine - Celeste, the girl he loves, is forbidden to him, there is madness tainting her family's blood, so his father has not given his blessing to the match.It's between two vineyards that Sobran meets Xas, an angel who has only stopped for a moment. Intrigued by Sobran's very human complaints, Xas reassures him that next year they will meet again and they shall toast to Sobran's marriage.And so they do, and from then on, once a year, Sobran, an ordinary French peasant, shares the events of his life entwined with the story of his vineyard. Sobran brought the angel his discontent, a savour to their talk, a refinement, like a paper screw of salt for a lunch to be eaten out-of-doors, at the edge of a meadow. Xas doesn't speak much of himself or of the curious double mark on his arm, made by Lucifer and God, who determined that \"Xas shall go freely.\" Perhaps angels are mysterious by nature. But along the years Sobran learns of Xas' love for botany (he's trying to grow a garden, and has a special fondness for roses), of Xas' interest in books, of Xas' other human friends - there was an old monk who passed away and was much mourned, there is a Turkish woman to whom he asks for advice regarding Sobran's troubles - it's difficult for an angel to understand humans, sometimes.And year after year, wine vintage after wine vintage, what they feel for each other grows.But angels live forever... and men do not. What he had wanted, with all his heart, was to match this being stride for stride over the miles. But a crippled angel will outstrip a man. Even if this doesn't seem like the kind of story to interest you as a reader, Elizabeth Knox's writing makes it worth reading the whole thing.It's not just the fact that she wrote an angel who, from all the emperors and kings and princes, chose to get to know a poor French peasant. It's the fact that the book employs some of the most beautiful language I've ever read. It's the fact that it follows wine vintages, and crisp or earthy flavours, and burgundy tinges, the fact that it's a love story told through the red stain cast by the sun piercing a full glass of wine. It's the fact that it's a love story with characters that feel real, and it's slow and alluring, and you get to taste it and see it slowly mature as if it were encased in an oak barrel.It's the fact that it'll break your heart, once you finish reading it."}, {"userName": "Marcie", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15338476-marcie", "userReview": "This book- I'm not sure what to rate it.I liked it somewhat. The unorthodox love story between a man and a angel sounded like it would make for a great story. But honestly? I found it to be a slow and dragging read. It didn't catch my attention until I reached 30% and then again towards the 50'ish % mark. Being that the story took place during the 1800's I think that had some to do with it. Not the historical aspect of it, but in the way it was written. So I think this is one of those moments where it was me not you kind of a thing. So with that being said, I also think this is going to be one of those rare moments where I will like the movie more than the book. Gaspard Ulliel plays the angel!

I never understand anyone's relationships, but this took the cake. Also, there are a lot of characters who are not more than names -- the author tries to hang a story on this silly premise by fleshing things out with the vintner's ever-increasing family, but, who cares? There aren't enough details to make it a historical fiction. It's a prosaic story aside from the fabulous idea that an angel would visit a man once a year for his whole life. However, she writes well, and some of the imaginative details are very cute, so if you like fantasy, give it a try. The ending didn't add much of anything for me, the revelation of the angel's \"identity,\" and the implication that sex is a fallen occupation. *Yawn*"}, {"userName": "Kat \u2620", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18457521-kat", "userReview": "~Buddy read with bert as an act of rebellion against Christmas and Christmas books.~ I finished this in early hours of Monday morning and I'm still dazed by what I read.

So I\u2019ll be focusing on feelz instead\u2026The Vintner\u2019s Luck is beautiful and sad. It\u2019s holding unto your heart and feels wonderful and terrible at the same time:I had to give myself up to you for your lifetime. What is faith when you feel you\u2019ve lost something forever? I had to have you \u2013 someone I could lose forever.This book touched me deeply and while the feeling of wonder and amazement was predominant, I think it also hung heavy over my head.Sobran and his angel Xas meet every year, and I thought this allowed for some very interesting and unique pacing. We\u2019re following Sobran\u2019s whole adult life and partly that of the people he knows and loves.\u2018Plant a pepper tree. It should be big enough within twenty years to set a table under \u2013 all summer for your family, and for us, on our one night.\u2019Sobran\u2019s and Xas\u2019s relationship goes through many phases and not all of them are pleasant but my fascination and caring always won over the negative and the heart-break.What I think is very fascinating is that we find many modern and quite forward themes in this book that is set in France in the first half of the 19th century. Although still befitting the time in its depiction of women, relationships, and religion, for example, I love that the book surpasses conventions and expectations. Basically, I think that there is a lot of depth and invention to all of these aspects. The book takes these themes and creates something new and challenging \u2013 even to us today \u2013 by not letting itself be put into boxes.There\u2019s a sequel to this book that I\u2019m really looking forward to. Elizabeth Knox is a new to me author and I\u2019ll make sure to look into what else she has written. The Vintner\u2019s Luck for one goes straight to my favourite shelf and I highly recommend it._________________________Genre: paranormal historical fictionTags: angel, wine, spanning a whole lifeRating: 5 stars, favourites 2016Notes: Read sequel with Emma from H&HBlog: Review for Just Love Romance"}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/611408-carrie", "userReview": "I have mixed feelings about this one. I read it compulsively, practically in one day, couldn't put it down, etc.. But at the same time, I can't say that I really liked it, though I am having a hard time articulating exactly why. It tells the story of Sobran Jodeau, who on one day in 1808 meets a male angel, Xas and whose entire life is changed forever as a result. Xas takes an interest in Sobran, which turns into friendship, and then (much later) more. I hate to tell more of the plot, since the interest in the book is the page turning aspect, but, generally, the book details Sobran's life and his relationship with Xas. Knox tells a good story, and excellently captures the characters living in small town Burgundy in the nineteenth century. She makes the characters, the historical setting, and the relationships seem real and interesting. Knox is obviously a skilled writer. The non-angel plots of the book - the parts detailing Sobran's experiences with his insane wife, his brother and sons, his growing friendship with the local baroness - were well done. They were compelling and detailed and human.Ok, I changed my mind. I know why I didn't like it and I am giving the plot away. Read on at your peril. The problem I had with the book was that the angel parts were so damn goofy. I mean it was all dramatic and poignant and mysterious. Forbidden love! Fallen angels! Cutting off of wings! It was like (very skilled) melodramatic fan fiction written by Goths - a better written Anne Rice, if you will. Every angel clich\u00e9, every tormented angst-ridden angle. I am embarrassed for me, that I read it and for Knox, that she wrote it. Her writing is good - it deserves better than the kind of plots you can find on the internet written by teenagers. Oh, I don't know - maybe its just because I like my fantasy goofy, with the poignant parts snuck in under the radar. I am sure that if I was twelve I would have thought this was the Most! Romantic! Book! Ever!, but I wish I could have read the story about the family and the murder and the crazy wife and the friendship with the baroness in 1808 France, and left Lucifer out of it entirely. There was enough there - we didn't really need the angel."}, {"userName": "Res", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56479-res", "userReview": "The life of the winemaker Sobran, who gets a visit every year from an angel named Xas. The writing was very beautiful -- just poetic enough, without crossing the line into pretentiousness. (Occasionally it was marred by grammatical errors, but I'm a stickler.) I'm not sure what made Sobran so special as to deserve to be an angel's best friend, but I did like him and enjoy seeing the world through his eyes. I liked Aurora and adored Xas. The friendships and loves among the three were sexy and moving. I would have liked the first sex scene to be a little less coy about exactly what was happening, or else not to have introduced the concept of angels lacking erections in the first place.I don't have a background in the kind of religion that involves angels, hell, and an apparently fallible God who makes bargains with Lucifer, but the author seems to be assuming a familiarity that I don't have; lacking it, I didn't understand the rules that applied to Xas, so some of his behavior didn't make a lot of sense to me. (How could he be physically injured? What was the significance of his cutting the tattoo with a knife, and what effect did that have on the bargain?)And this is a nitpick, but one that nagged at me: Xas says his name is \"sass, like spit and vinegar\" -- but they're speaking French, not English!"}, {"userName": "Judy Croome", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4240599-judy-croome", "userReview": "This is a difficult novel to review. \u2018Strange\u2019 is the word that springs to mind. The premise \u2013 a lifelong friendship between an angel and a vintner \u2013 interested me, because I like surreal and/or paranormal stories. When I started reading, I couldn\u2019t put it down because the imagery was beautiful and the philosophical discussions on religious beliefs interesting although, at times, too obscure. So, what was the problem I had with this story? I couldn\u2019t get emotionally attached to any of the characters. There was enough in the novel to keep me reading, but not enough to make me really care any more than an occasional twinge what happened to the characters because I was disconnected from their motives and emotions. Both Xas (the angel) and Sobran (the vintner) were not easy to know, and this was to the detriment of the story. The style was also difficult: too often, the reader was expected to make conceptual leaps of logic and/or imagination that, rather than intriguing me, simply made me lose interest. For such a beautifully written book, it\u2019s a pity that it only engaged my head, but not my heart. I may have read the book, but I didn\u2019t \u201clive\u201d it.

I tis the story of Sobran's life and his relationship with Xas his angel who agrees to meet him one night each year. \"Flirtation, not love,\" was one of my favourite ways to describe this book until about halfway through where I feel hard as the love story grows and becomes heart-wrenchingly wonderful. The love story between Xas and Sobran was the part that truly captured me. It isn't easy, they both struggle, as how can a relationship between an angel and a mortal ever truly work and last? But there is enough to capture your heart and when you reach the end, it really really begins to hurt. Know's writing is beautiful and this book is full of lines that are endlessly quotable.

They talk for a while; eventually they agree to meet every year on the same night. I loved this premise; it reminded me of one of my favorite stories ever,  Neil Gaiman\u2019s \u201cMen of Good Fortune.\u201d The difference is that \u201cGood Fortune\u201d is about someone who will live forever, while Luck takes place over a single human lifetime. Also, in Luck, our human protagonist, Sobran, and his otherworldly visitor actually become lovers. Score!Well, sort of. This book is actually not nearly as good as \u201cMen of Good Fortune,\u201d although that\u2019s setting the bar pretty high, in my opinion. The relationship between Sobran, his angel, and Aurora\u2014a young widow Sobran also comes to have an important connection with\u2014is wonderful and rich and nuanced. I liked all three of these characters very much. The book\u2019s theology, however, confused me deeply: I did not understand it at all, which made the motivations of the higher powers at work in this novel\u2014some of whom made personal appearances\u2014completely opaque to me. The love story (stories!) still moved me, but I felt like I was missing the larger meaning of the text.Also, the ending decidedly underwhelmed. The structure is so linear\u2014year by year by year\u2014that I felt that the climatic moments came at odd places in the story. So this is another one that goes into the category of \u201cdidn\u2019t love it, still worth reading.\u201d Just make sure you\u2019ve read \u201cMen of Good Fortune\u201d first!"}, {"userName": "Cassian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/247153-cassian", "userReview": "This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. I originally picked it up (from half.com, as apparently it's out of print now) when I heard that there was a film adaptation in production. I hope that I enjoy the movie as much as I enjoyed the book!Knox's characters are rich, believable and human - especially her angels - and the story an especially moving romance that delves deep in its exploration of death, obsession, and family. She offers at the same time an alternate take on angels, heaven, and hell that paints these usually stoic ideas in a much more sympathetic, human light; she gives angels human desires, emotions, and faults, God human shortcomings, and Satan wisdom, wit, and compassion beyond what most of us could have imagined. Knox's prose is absolutely a delight to read, overflowing with metaphor, understated and subtle.I would recommend this book especially to anyone interested in the myth and folklore of angels, but also to anyone who, like myself, enjoys a heartbreaking romance."}], "description": "One summer night in 1808, Sobran Jodeau sets out to drown his love sorrows in his family's vineyard when he stumbles on an angel. Once he gets over his shock, Sobran decides that Xas, the male angel, is his guardian sent to counsel him on everything from marriage to wine production. But Xas turns out to be a far more mysterious character.
