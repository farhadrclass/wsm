The back of the novel compares Shelby Foote to William Faulkner, which immediately inspired within me the following thought: \"Oh, crap.\" For I hates me some Faulkner. However, I've come to realize that, more often than not, a novel being described as \"Faulknerian\" is really just shorthand for the following: Southern; quirky, dark characters with unhealthy libertine appetites; and a tragic ending--and these are all things with which I'm okay. It doesn't always mean a rampant disregard for punctuation or that a boy falls in love with a cow. Foote's novel has a somewhat stock plot in Southern literature: Yankee comes to the South, tries to make inroads to the gentility and old money, and is destroyed in the process. However, it's the dysfunctional and well drawn characters that make the novel such an enjoyable read. Set in the 1920's, the novel has as its setting a South that is still torn between the traditions of the past and the modernization of the future. This is represented by the two women of the novel: Amy Carruthers, symbolic of the new money of industry and the loosening of Bible Belt morals, and Amanda Barcroft, symbolic of the straight-laced world of old money and respectability. Both women are disconnected from the \"Old Miss\" of Southern myth and lack a defined role in society. Harley Drew, a Northern banker who longs to live the life of high society, becomes involved with both women. Throw in Jeff, a blind voyeur (\"For what could be more pitiful than a voyeur in the dark?\") and Amy's violently jealous husband, and it's just a matter of time before the crap hits the fan with particularly cringe-worthy and entertaining results.Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder"}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "Five main characters, three of whom are despicable human beings in all sorts of ways, two of them indescribably sad victims of the others.

When slick Harley Drew ( a Northerner) comes to town seeking fortune, he finds easy prey in Amanda Barcroft the gullible old maid daughter who stands to inherit her father's estate and also the young , beautiful, but fiercely restless Amy Carruthers, wife of recently blinded Jeff who has retained his father's wealth. Getting past one woman's father and the other's jealous husband will prove far more difficult than expected and unfortunately for Drew they're the ones who hold the keys to the family fortunes. Foote is most famous for his Civil War narratives, but he also wrote six novels this being the most touted. With a style compared to Faulkner, it's far easier to read. Disappointingly, as there are no like-able or even sympathy provoking characters here, nobody really gets the well deserved comeuppance that I found myself desperately wishing for, and the ending - did it have to be ever so vague ??

Now I find that he is also a novelist of some power and skill.Love in a Dry Season was a 5-star novel to me right up to the last two chapters, when it slid down the scale to a still very respectable 4-stars. Written in the Southern Gothic style that echoes with strains of Faulkner and Tennessee Williams, it looks at Mississippi through the eyes of someone who understands even the quirkiest parts of Southern culture and what sets it apart from any other place on earth. Major Barcroft is shudderingly believable here and inconceivable anywhere else. Foote gives us the willing victim, self-sacrificing Miss Amanda, who has a strength of character and endurance that is as admirable as it is bewildering; the pitiable Jeff Carruthers, who can be as easily despised as pitied; Jeff\u2019s abominable wife, Amy; and the ultimate con-man around whom they all rotate, Harley Drew. He leads us a dance that is hard to watch, but from which we cannot force ourselves to look away.The end of this novel was not a bad ending. It was not an illogical ending. It was not even an unjustifiable ending. But, for me it was an unsatisfactory ending. It felt as if the story had built to a crescendo and then someone popped the champagne cork to find the champagne itself was flat, had already fizzed out before it could be sampled. Perhaps I wanted a kind of retributive justice that doesn\u2019t show up all that often in life or in novels. Who knows.I\u2019m pleased that I was brought to this novel by On The Southern Literary Trail book group. I don\u2019t think I would have come across it on my own.

That's how this story wrapped up, although it had huge potential.This noirish story of a naive spinster-to-be, her overbearing father, and the slickster who woos her is full of devilish promise. Add in a horrible married couple - first cousins - with an odd amorous relationship, and there is a powder keg of possibility. The characters are nicely done, their romantic imbroglios are riveting, but the entire thing just fizzles and eventually peters out. It felt like the fireworks barge out on Lake Jordan sunk way before the big finale. 3.5 for meEDITED TO ADD: upon thinking about it, I finally realized why this plot seemed so familiar. Twenty years before this was written, William Faulkner wrote a short story about a na\u00efve spinster-to-be, her overbearing father, an inappropriate suitor who woos her weekly, an old Victorian house, a sick room in the house, and a woman who refuses to acknowledge the death of a loved one. Yep - if you've ever read the wonderful short story called A Rose for Emily, then you'll follow my drift. It felt like Foote grabbed the guts of that story, added the lecherous married couple, and had the inappropriate suitor be the tie that binds them.Maybe somebody who is better read and more literary than me (it ain't hard to be, peeps!) can tell me if that general story line is just an old style plot or formula, similar to how romance novels have a woman with a husband they feel that is not trustworthy and a potential lover to entice her.

If so, then Shelby Foote takes one of them the classic love triangle and makes it his own.[return][return]As in other novels set in contemporary times, the story takes place in the fictional town of Bristol, Mississippi, in the equally fictional Jordan County. Amanda Barcroft, virgin daughter of the supposedly fabulously wealthy Major Barcroft, has spent her life caring for her father and sister. A  catch , but the price the Major and the Barcroft ways seems excessively high to any potential suitors from the area. Another side of the triangle is the couple, Jeff and Amy Carruthers, returned to Amy s aunt s home, Briartree (surely not accidental that Jefferson Davis Mississippi plantation was named Briarfield) on Lake Jordan. Amy and Jeff are a young, wealthy loveless couple held together by amusement with Jeff on her part and helpless obsession on his. Blinded in a car accident, Jeff is insanely jealous.[return][return]Enter Harley Drew, from a steel mill town in Ohio the classic fortune hunter, the early 20th century version of the Northern carpetbagger. Cold, manipulative, determined to remove himself as far as possible from his Polish origins, Harley has no real emotion except greed. Seeing his chance at living the kind of high life he has always dreamed for himself, he courts Amanda, but falls in love with Amy.[return][return]The heart of the story, but as in all of Foote s novels that take place in Mississippi, nothing is ever at it seems, and nothing ever works out as expected. Or, if it does, the expectation has nothing to do with the reality.[return][return]Foote s Mississippi novels always give the Place Jordan County a powerful part to play. The area itself exerts its own influence and shapes events through its characters. On first reading, the characters seem positively weird, a collection of oddities. But at heart, these are really ordinary people, quite recognizable, who act the way they do because of the restrictions and demands imposed on them by Place. The result is not so much horrifying as seemingly inevitable and certainly absorbing in the telling.[return][return]Foote s prose is perfect for the story. He was a master at delineating this sort of town, this sort of situation, this sort of people. He has some deft touches with local idiom that still is perfectly clear within the context. His description of Bristol society especially in the Flapper Era and during the Depression is a marvel of spare, detached writing. The book ends well after the climax of the story, but there is no loss of interest, and the end itself is unexpected.[return]I consider that Shelby Foote was one of the best of the modern Southern writers even apart from his brilliant 3-volume history of the Civil War; Love In A Dry Season is one of his best."}, {"userName": "Dave Reidy", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1167246-dave-reidy", "userReview": "Known primarily for his history of the Civil War, Shelby Foote was also a very fine novelist.

Still, there is enough of Foote's fine writing to recommend \"Love\" even with its comparatively dialed-down passions.In \"Love in a Dry Season,\" set in the 1920s to the 1940s, Northerner Harley Drew, visiting Mississippi on business, then sees a personal business opportunity (money through faux romance) and decides to stay. Drew, though not presented as a dark-hearted bastard, nevertheless is a self-centered one; he consorts with women of two wealthy Southern families with an eye on beefing up his own bank account. The Barcroft family features a rich, protective patriarch who chafes because he hasn't gotten into a proper war, and his reclusive daughters: the sickly older one and the younger daughter, Amanda, whom Drew woos for many years in the hope of getting some of the family fortune. The father is wise to him, forbidding a marriage with Amanda, so Drew plays a waiting game, seeing Amanda on the sly a couple times a month to keep the one-sided fire going. Drew is hoping for the father's death, but his wait lasts years and years.Meanwhile, flirty Amy Carruthers is married to Jeff, a man who was blinded in a car accident. Amy steps out on her husband occasionally and hooks up with Drew, who at first seems to be hedging his bets, but in fact he actually cares about this selfish woman. For a time, he keeps both balls on the air, waiting for nature to take its course, until finally he hatches a plan to make something happen.Foote, as usual, writes well, and the novel hardly is a letdown. He sets the groundwork nicely with brief histories of Drew and the Barcrofts and Carrutherses, and his Faulkner worship again is in evidence here and there, such as his curious way with contractions. But the fact that Drew, a man to whom women are attracted, would wait a decade to marry for money a woman he doesn't really care about, is a stretch. Foote also at times struggles to keep the plot moving during the waiting, but because his prose never bores, it's not difficult to stick with the tale.\"Love in a Dry Season\" is another good one in Foote's small (only six, thanks to all those years absorbed in his Civil War history) collection of novels, but not a great one."}, {"userName": "FrankH", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1301039-frankh", "userReview": "Club Read: On the Southern Literary Trail Comments: It does indeed seem to me Foote's novel fuses elements of the Southern Gothic, the Barcroft story, with certain material, i.e. the Carruthers' characterizations, you'd expect to find in something like Fitzgerald's 'Stories of the Jazz Age', if not 'The Great Gatsby'. Feeding the Gothic narrative, Foote portrays the Barcroft family as largely the malformed creation of a stern patriarch undone by the successive deaths of his wife, young son and eldest daughter. Isolation and an insularity of viewpoint envelop the survivors -- Amanda and the Major himself -- and per the dictates of the genre, this cannot be expected to end well. The thoroughly modern Amy and Jeff Carruthers, on the other hand, behave as creatures of unending appetite, with little sense of purpose in life other than seeking out churn and the latest kick to stoke the burn-rate of their family's tobacco money. They are in one sense the epitome of rootlessness, the foil to the Barcrofts being too tied down by all their inwardness and attachment to the past. Foote does a masterful turn balancing the coy restraint of his omniscient narrator with the points of view of the other characters -- principally Harley Drew -- no slam-dunk by any means. But I'm still trying to make up my mind about Harley. He's slick and conniving for sure, but \"his ability to wait on good things\", as LeAnne puts it, makes him in my eyes less shrewd, even something of a rube. Most experienced con men prefer the fast nickel over the slow dime, so I'm having trouble seeing how the guy that finagled his way into the lucrative bank job failed to see how time and the relentless cold-heartedness of the Major might undo his plans for Amanda. LeAnne, I'm pleased you cited the Major's staging of the Civil War battle with his disinterested son -- it was an especially telling detail going to the old man's state of mind. But was it the battle of Vicksburg or Fredericksburg? I can't check the text of my edition -- it's sitting in the library -- but I know the first was a Union victory (eventually), the second a bloody triumph for the Confederacy."}, {"userName": "Kitsana Dounglomchan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22239990-kitsana-dounglomchan", "userReview": "This was the first novel of S. Foote's I had ever read, and I enjoyed it. Foote gave an interview in the Paris Review back in 1999; I highly recommend it if you're a fan of his work. In this interview, Foote says it's important to build the characters first and then put them into a harrowing situation. I'm paraphrasing him, but he said something to this effect. You see this come alive while reading this book. The level of detail that he goes into with Maj Bancroft, Amanda, Florence, Jeff, Amy, and Harley Drew give you a heightened sense of each of these people. And once you get to the meat of the novel you feel like you're walking around in their skin--you know them that well. I also enjoyed how Foote dropped numerous references to the Civil War. Being that my introduction to Foote was through the Civil War Narrative, I enjoyed the part about Barcroft reenacting the battle of Fredricksburg with his son not having any interest. But back to the characters. I don't do enough contemporary reading, but I'd imagine that not as many books go into depth the way Foote did with his characters in this story. I'm sure that's done because of the product of the times we live, but I find it refreshing to read a story like this.

Love in a Dry Season describes an erotic and economic triangle, in which two wealthy and fantastically unhappy Mississippi families -- the Barcrofts and the Carrutherses -- are joined by an open-faced fortune hunter from the North, a man whose ruthlessness is matched only by his inability to understand the people he tries to exploit and his fatal incomprehension of the passions he so casually ignites. Combining a flawless sense of place with a Faulknerian command of the grotesque, Foote's novel turns a small cotton town into a sexual battleground as fatal as Vicksburg or Shiloh -- and one where strategy is no match for instinct and tradition.", "title": "Love in a Dry Season", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11007316-love-in-a-dry-season", "average": 3.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387669387l/11007316.jpg", "reviews": 38, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/24846.Shelby_Foote", "name": "Shelby Foote"}], "type": ["Fiction", "American", "Historical", "Gothic"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11007316-love-in-a-dry-season", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102218.Love_in_a_Dry_Season", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2655109-love-in-a-dry-season", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44236.The_Civil_War_Vol_1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44234.The_Civil_War", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/874419.The_Civil_War_Vol_3", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/373593.The_Civil_War_Vol_2", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/764255.Shiloh"]}
