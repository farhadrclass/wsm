Oooooh average rating 4.14! Happy day!!!!My first thought:My second thought:My third thought:My other thoughts are verging between ugh idiot, duh, gah and pass the jelly.Imagine you have a cold. But not a normal cold. It\u2019s one of those bad ones where you have to drown in antibiotics and syrup. You know the feeling you get when you are eating something, and you can\u2019t feel its taste? You look at the people you\u2019re sharing the meal with and see them moan in pleasure because the food is so delicious. Don\u2019t you feel like stabbing them in the eye with your fork because they can feel it, but you can\u2019t? That\u2019s exactly how I feel about The Shadow Reader.My main issue is (as you surely guessed) the freaking love triangle. I\u2019m not going to play the pick your side game. Again. Why are all authors using this damn love triangle theme? I really don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s unoriginal and boring, and it will turn the book into this as well. What\u2019s so hard to get? It made the book too frustrating to the point of wanting to throw it out of the window to taste some of the acid rain I\u2019m having right now. The fact that it\u2019s an e-book, and that I\u2019ve read it on my Kindle (which I love at the moment), kept me from doing it.Anyway, I fail to see where McKenzie is badass, she\u2019s more of a typical YA heroine. The Shadow Reader was supposed to be a YA; they probably mixed up the genres somehow. Which reminds me\u2026 this book is so f*cking predictable! I knew how it was going to end since chapter 10. Not. Cool.In the end Naito was my favorite character. I\u2019d maybe read the next book for his sake only. But I won\u2019t. To the spam shelf with you!"}, {"userName": "Jessi \u2665\ufe0f H.

Filled with fae and magic, badass female characters and a (funny) handsome bad boy? There\u2019s a war going on in the fae world between the king, his followers and the rebels. In the middle of it is McKenzie, a shadow reader, one of the strongest weapons agains the rebellion. One day McKenzie gets captured by the rebellion and soon her world is shook. Who can she trust? Who is lying? And who should sit on the throne? That was a book I couldn\u2019t lay down. First of all, the main character is so funny and so freakin stubborn. She was constantly trying to run away and in the end I always smiled reading the dialogues between Aren and McKenzie. This is definitely a book that has a nice pacing, is filled with action and a little bit of love and heartbreak. Definitely worth reading! Characters \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fOh, McKenzie our wonderful main character- you go girl. You are so stubborn, so creative in getting away from the rebellion that you don\u2019t even mind getting hurt. And you\u2019re so intelligent! I was in love with you from page one. McKenzie was definitely my favorite character in this one. I wouldn\u2019t say she had a character development in the end, but did she find her kind, brave heart. But one thing was a little bit sad to see - McKenzie was nearly always saved by someone. She wasn\u2019t a girl who could save herself, but at least she tried to - she didn\u2019t want to rely on someone. That was a nice start, maybe it gets better with the next books. Aren was the Rebell who captured McKenzie and tried to get her to work for the rebellion. He was a funny, handsome and kind guy who could be sassy sometimes. I loved him. He was never brutal or mean to McKenzie. He always treated her good. I liked that about him. Kyol was her partner and guard send by the king of the fae. She worked with him for over ten years for the king. Kyols biggest character treat was his loyalty to the king. This man was so loyal, I never doubted it. Never ever. He wouldn\u2019t betray the kingdom for McKenzie even though if he would have they could\u2019ve been together. But he didn\u2019t. The best thing about the book was, that I liked all the side characters. I was interested about what happened to them and if they survived and when they died I was actually pretty sad. I especially loved the female badass characters in this one - Lena and Keira, if you want someone who is loyal, brave and ready to fight you should definitely choose these two ladies! World \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThis is probably the hardest thing to describe, but so so important! The world building was great in this one, not perfect but still really enjoyable. We have a great magic in here: we have the fae who are invisible to humans if they don\u2019t want to be seen and who produce little lightings when touched by a human. The fae move from world to world by portals and through the worlds through little rips they create in the world. They step through them and step right into another place. Also they\u2019re bonds between two fae - when they\u2019re bonded their power is put together and they can feel each other through rooms and places. They feel where the other is. Next to the awesome jumping-through-places-talent they can also use heat and fire to burn people or heal them with their power. There are other special talents, but I don\u2019t want to spoiler, so just know that there is more! Next to the awesome fae we have human shadow readers who can locate the fae by reading the shadows after they disappeared into a rip through the world. They also can see through illusions. All in all there is an awesome magic system in there and so many places to discover.Also we jump between the human world and the fae realm which makes everything so much more interesting. (They even went to Germany - how cool is that?) My favorite thing about the whole world was when humans and fae touched their touch is addictive. And as long as they touch little Lightnings or sparks jump through their skin. It seemed like a really beautiful and magical thing. \ud83d\ude0dRelationships \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fOh, boy. I don\u2019t even now if I want to be called  Kaesha or Nalkin-Shom . For a proper explanation you should read the book, but i would probably choose the second name. I\u2019m team Aren, always was, always will. Yes, I know you think: what? there is a love triangle in it? Yeah, it has a love triangle, but I didn\u2019t really saw that as a problem. I\u2019m not a fan of love triangles, don\u2019t get me wrong, but only when they\u2019re absolutely useless and stupid. But this one was kind of nice? I liked it. I liked McKenzie and her chaos of feelings. Writing style \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fSandy Williams is no Leigh Bardugo or Sarah J. Maas, but her writing was still really nice, with a nice pacing, funny dialogues and action. It was always entertaining, never boring, but it wasn\u2019t a beautiful or special writing. I couldn\u2019t even find a proper quote I could use in the beginning. But still: try out the book! It was definitely worth a read. P.s. if you hate Acotar etc. don\u2019t read this book. You\u2019ll probably hate this one too."}, {"userName": "Steph Sinclair", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4642710-steph-sinclair", "userReview": "[and the hot Fae guys!

Partly because of all the dazzling reviews it has received from my most trusted GR friends, and partly just because it is sold as exactly the kind of urban fantasy I love: strong heroine, hot supernatural men, \"cataclysmic civil war\" between the fae... I admit that I was excited enough to buy this book before reading the 4/5 star reviews.Okay, so what exactly was my problem? I exhale a great big shuddering sigh as I say - for the umpteenth time - this was just never anything special to me. This genre, the urban fantasy genre, is easily one of my favourites when I find a book/series that really appeals to me; they have a way of dragging you into their world and making you care about the characters and lust after the hunky men. But countless times I come across the same old pattern. The Shadow Reader will undoubtedly be loved by hardcore UF fans who actually read these books for that same old pattern that I mentioned. Some people love this format and I'm sure that's why books continue to be written in a very same-y way.For me, I made the inevitable comparisons to the Fever series and this novel just couldn't compete at all. I'm still waiting for a fae novel that can and I've been starting to believe I won't ever find one. Mckenzie is definitely a strong heroine, but at the end of this book she doesn't feel as well-developed to me as Mac did halfway through Darkfever. The thing I loved most about Mac is that she was a normal young woman, in fact she first appears far more ditzy than most. She doesn't stroll in, sword swinging, and she hasn't been trained for the situation she finds herself in. And yet, she shows that even the ditziest, blondest young women can turn kick-ass if the moment calls for it. This is one thing I love about that series which is very difficult to find in others. PNR heroines are often sappy and pathetic, UF heroines tend to be factory-manufactured warriors. I want to see regular girls and women - like myself - showing that they don't need super powers to be awesome.I didn't even bother comparing either Kyol or Aren with Barrons because they are a million miles apart in every way. But looking at them on their own they still seem to be rather boring, Kyol's the nice guy and Aren's the bad one. Mckenzie has known (and secretly wanted) Kyol for years, she has known (and secretly wanted) Aren for a couple of weeks. Guess who she chooses here?? Yet another Twilight-style love triangle it would seem. ZZZzzzz....Yes, so sorry to the people who loved this, I'm not sure why I feel guilty for not loving it too, but I do. The only thing I will say in its favour is that this book reminded me how much I need to re-read the Fever books, so I thank Sandy Williams for that."}, {"userName": "Vinaya", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4687823-vinaya", "userReview": "[ the King is dead and the Fae have a Queen for the first time.

I have mulled over my review for a few days now, and I'm still trying to figure out why most people loved this and I didn't. I think my main issue with this book is that the world building and plot felt like a distant second in priority to the love triangle.What I liked when I started with this book was the world. I love the idea of the fissures that bring the fae in and out of our realm, and the concept of a shadow reader, a person who can see the shadow through the fissure that indicates the fae's location. I was enamored with the world and thought this book was a sure thing for me. However...As the book progressed, I started having some real issues. First of all, I though that McKenzie was unforgivably wishy-washy about who she was interested in. The back and forth went on for the entirety of the book and, honestly, bored me to tears. I was also mystified as to why, literally out of freaking nowhere, Aren starts loving her. McKenzie is downright rude and mistrusting of Aren and it didn't seem like they were even building up to \"like\" so I was completely taken aback by his interest in her. I thought the whole \"court\" vs \"rebels\" thing wasn't very well explained and I felt like the seriousness of the issue got pushed aside so McKenzie could debate more about who she wanted to kiss. It irked me to no end. As the book progressed, I realized that I was never going to get the plot that I was hoping for and this wasn't going to be to my taste. If I compare this book to the amazing and unforgettable Fever series (Darkfever is the first), which also is about the fae, this book is like the gum stuck to the shoe of Jericho Barrons.

If this book is any indication, I anticipate great things from Williams and this series in the future. I enjoyed The Shadow Reader immensely.McKenzie is a human woman with a talent that makes her invaluable to the fae. She is a shadow reader, which means that when a fae teleports, she can map where that fae has traveled to. There are other shadow readers, but McKenzie is an unusually good one. As a teenager, she was recruited to help King Atroth\u2019s Court win a war. Now, ten years later, the Court still calls upon her services\u2026 and it\u2019s taken a toll on McKenzie\u2019s life. Her family has written her off as crazy. Her college degree is taking far longer than it was supposed to. And her forbidden flirtation with Kyol Taltrayn, the King\u2019s sword-master, keeps McKenzie\u2019s love life on hold. She\u2019s ready to retire as a shadow reader, finish her education, and live a normal human life. Then she\u2019s kidnapped by rebel leader Aren Jorreb, who also needs a shadow reader, and everything changes. McKenzie is attracted to Aren, but at first figures it\u2019s Stockholm syndrome. (May I just mention how refreshing it is that McKenzie even *considered* the possibility of Stockholm syndrome? I\u2019ve read way too many books where the whole romance seemed to be rooted in it, yet it was never really examined.) But Aren has some unsettling information for her, information that leads her to wonder whether she\u2019s been on the wrong side of the war all along.This is a love triangle for readers who are sick of love triangles. Why? Because this is a *good* one. The question is not just who\u2019s more handsome or makes McKenzie\u2019s heart beat faster. McKenzie is not just deciding between two men but two worldviews and two versions of the truth. If one man is telling the truth, the other is guilty of horrible things, and vice versa \u2014 and really, no one\u2019s hands are clean in this war. McKenzie is a fierce heroine, not necessarily in the combat sense, but in her determination to seek the truth, stick to her own sense of ethics, and maintain her self-respect. She\u2019s strong in the face of psychological pressures that would break a lot of people, and it\u2019s great watching her forge her own path that isn\u2019t quite what either of her suitors has in mind for her.McKenzie\u2019s struggles play out both in her own psyche and in Williams\u2019 well-realized setting. It can take a little while to get one\u2019s bearings in the fae world Williams has created, but she does a terrific job of making that world feel fleshed-out and lived-in. One gets the sense of a rich history and geography in the background, even if McKenzie only sees a small sampling of it in this first book. I was reminded both of Karen Marie Moning\u2019s FEVER universe and C.L. Wilson\u2019s TAIREN SOUL in terms of the setting.The Shadow Reader kept me turning pages frantically, and when I wasn\u2019t reading it, I was thinking about how much I wanted to be reading it and finding out what happened next or what new truth would be revealed. I had a lot of fun with The Shadow Reader and can\u2019t wait to read more about McKenzie."}, {"userName": "Denisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14215152-denisa", "userReview": "[ kill one of the pretty important and likable characters.

Keeping in mind, that 4 stars is a book I love and 5 stars are reserved for books I think are truly top of the pile books and I'll recommend them to anyone who will listen. I thought this book started out very strongly, and I was intrigued both by the heroine and by the world the author has developed. I liked the heroine's voice, and I especially appreciated that she had strength of conviction. However, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a fan of using the \"which guy should I choose\" plot construct as the driving conflict for an urban fantasy. Actually, I'm not keen on it as a form of conflict in general. I like romantic conflict, but not in terms of \"which guy\" instead of romantic conflict between two people. I also want the driving conflict of an urban fantasy to be within the world itself, because I think this is much harder to pull off, but ultimately more interesting. \"Which guy\" is hard to pull off with any kind of original twist at this point. So this book began to falter for me at the point I realized this was going to be the main conflict, and ultimately didn't convince me in the final choice she made. I saw so much potential in building this world, and the conflict between the two competing faction of Fae, and I was left disappointed that more development wasn't offered there, instead of in the heroine's torn feelings about two men. I do have to give the author props for not leaving this on a cliffhanger, though there's clearly room for future books. At the end of the day, I can't explain more about my dissatisfaction with this book, since some of it lies in how it ended, how she chose, and explaining that would be a major plot spoiler for the book. I will say that I think readers who love urban fantasy and love the conflict of choosing between two heroes will enjoy this book, and I think the writing makes the story interesting and diverting. I'd like to see more from this author within the constrains of a new, more developed conflict. e"}, {"userName": "Cait", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5254851-cait", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "AH", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255548-ah", "userReview": "Awesome! Just Awesome!It\u2019s almost impossible to review this book without gushing. There is so much to love about The Shadow Reader by Sandy Williams. The story is told from the main character McKenzie Lewis\u2019 point of view. Let me tell you, I loved McKenzie\u2019s voice. McKenzie is an intelligent young woman who has suffered through life because of her ability to see the fae. Gifted with Sight, McKenzie can also map where the fae go just by looking at their shadows. Consequently, McKenzie is a valuable human. McKenzie\u2019s life is not easy. She has been in psychiatric wards, has had difficulty completing her college degree, she is estranged from her parents, and has few (basically only one) human friends. For someone who has been through so much, McKenzie is remarkably \u201cnormal\u201d She is smart, observant, loyal, and determined. Oh, she also likes to escape from her captors \u2013 often. McKenzie is not one of those TSTL (too stupid to live) characters. Every move she makes is made for a reason.McKenzie has been working for the fae Court. Her handler Kyol, may or may not be in love with her. She has been working with him for ten years and McKenzie is in love with Kyol even though human-fae relationships are forbidden.McKenzie\u2019s world changes when she is abducted by the rebels. Suddenly, her loyalties to the fae Court are challenged as she learns more about their oppressive ways and Kyol\u2019s role. McKenzie is taken in by Aren who arranges for her to learn the fae language, something that she was not allowed to learn when she was in the fae Court. McKenzie is treated well by the rebels despite several attempts to escape. Then there\u2019s Aren. *swoon* Now, you are asking yourself \u201cIs there a love triangle?\u201d Yes, there is. Is it an annoying love triangle where the girl plays the men off each other? No. Not at all. McKenzie\u2019s world views get changed when she is with the rebels. She chalks up her attraction to Aren as Stockholm syndrome, but there is more to it. This is a love triangle done right. This is a fae book that I enjoyed. The world building is extensive but not complicated like most fae books. The fae realms had a similar feel to our world but without our technology. The book skipped between the fae realms and our world. An additional adversary was added: a group of human vigilante forces intent on destroying the fae.The fae structure and politics were intriguing, especially the way that the king\u2019s influence was attained. I enjoyed the magical aspects as well, especially the way that human skin reacted in fae and how a fae\u2019s touch would cause pleasurable electrical impulses on the skin. Neat! My only criticism of this book would be that a glossary of fae terms would have been appreciated.If you haven\u2019t had the chance to read The Shadow Reader, move it up your reading list.

Unfortunately, I only ended up liking the story overall. I\u2019m sure this is a case of \u201cit\u2019s me, not you\u201d with a lot of \u201cit\u2019s the narrator\u201d, as well. Twelve hours is a long time when the narrator isn\u2019t your cup of tea. McKenzie has \u201cthe sight\u201d meaning she can see fae when other humans cannot. She\u2019s special because she can locate other fae who shift by reading the shadows they leave in their wake. This is very helpful to the current fae king because there\u2019s a war going on in the Realm and locating Rebels is an aid in the fight. McKenzie has worked with the king\u2019s sword master, Kyol, who keeps her safe during missions. Unfortunately, McKenzie has fallen hard for Kyol, and this is a big problem because the king has forbidden relationships between his fae and humans. Kyol would never disobey his king outright. This doesn\u2019t mean there haven\u2019t been stolen kisses and things haven\u2019t gotten heavy between them, only that they have no future. McKenzie knows she must move on and plans on separating herself from the fae permanently.Things do not go according to plan when she\u2019s kidnapped by one of the Rebel leaders, Aren, and expected to help them in their fight. Aren is charismatic and maddening, but he stands for everything that McKenzie has been taught to hate. And yes, you guessed it; we have ourselves a love triangle. *groans* While being held captive, McKenzie begins to learn the situation between the Rebels and the Court may not be as clear cut, and the full truth has been kept from her. I guess my main issue with the story was McKenzie. I had such a hard time with her. The back and forth feelings for Kyol and Aren were grating to me. Supposedly, McKenzie\u2019s been head-over-heels in love with Kyol for years and then she suddenly has feelings for Aren? Plus, when it was clear that the Rebels were not the bad people the Court made them out to be, she makes choices that put everyone in danger. It did not help that the narrator\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t my preference, and her performance made me think of a teenager instead of a mid-twenty year old. By the end, I started liking McKenzie just a little bit more and the action became exciting. I will continue with the series because I got the last book for review, so I hope the positive changes continue. I won\u2019t be continuing with an audio version in the next book, and I think that\u2019ll help with my enjoyment of the series, as well.You can find this review and more at The Readers Den."}, {"userName": "Regina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104032-regina", "userReview": "Why is this not a 5 star or a 4 star book for me? I have put off writing this review for a week or so because I am confused as to why everyone I know on goodreads loved this book but me. In part, I think this may be a \"Its not you, its me\" kinda thing. I may be over my urban fantasy binge. Hey, it was a good ride. It started summer 2010 and lasted until now. When I hear about new titles or series in the paranormal, they just do not interest me -- with the exception of my favorite authors and series. So, my thoughts on this book should be put into that context -- that urban fantasy just does not have the same pull for me. Another issue for me that should help my feelings on this book be put into context -- for an urban fantasy book to thrill me, I need the main struggle to be something other than the romance. That is why I prefer UF over paranormal romance. And I know may of my goodreads friends can point out several paranormal romance series, historical romances, and contemporary romances that I love. Yes, I do enjoy a romance that is well done -- but my well done is this. I enjoy the angsty romance plot line too, but the true struggle/fight/confict for me needs to be about the world/story. And the characters and relationships in the book need to be three-dimensional with growth and progression. I did not see this in Shadow Reader. In my opinion, the main conflict in Shadow Reader is the romance. And that is fine, but I didn't buy into the characters feelings for the individual that made up the third part of the love triangle. Which poses a problem for me as a reader, if I don't believe in the romance, which is the main struggle of the book -- then the book falls flat for me. The romance with the guy who is the third leg of the triangle (I am trying to be vague and non-spoilerish) just was not believable for me. What I saw was an incredibly sexy guy that the lead character was attracted to and he was attracted to her as well to her. But when did they develop love? I did not see a relationship developing at all. I never felt or believed in the \"who should she choose\" storyline. I had strong opinions about who she should drop and then maybe move on in her life, but choosing someone else to fill the void of the person just dropped? Nah, Sandy Williams did not convince me. There was a side conflict to the storyline -- where should MacKenzie place her allegiance? The court or the rebels? Again, I thought this was not set up well nor was it done believably. MacKenzie places her allegiance with any one side based solely on emotion and relationships, not on critical evaluation. I know people do this in real life, but I find that downright scary. But whatever, my criticism of decisions aside I do not think the author convinced me as to who MacKenzie should be loyal too. So those were my problems. I liked the characters, I liked the world, and I really enjoyed the beginning. I do think this should be labeled paranormal romance or romance based urban fantasy though. Positives about the book: The world building is done very well and there are some interesting side characters. There is solid writing and some good action scenes. If readers are okay with the main conflict being about who will she choose, then I think this book will be a win for those readers.

I am one of the few people in the urban fantasy reading world that is not a fan of the Guild Hunter series for the same reason Shadow Reader missed the mark for me."}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "Review courtesy of All Things Urban FantasyThere is something shocking about McKenzie Lewis, the protagonist in THE SHADOW READER by Sandy Williams. She\u2019s not a super woman/warrior goddess/magical titan capable of destroying the universe with a wink. Nope, unlike many urban fantasy heroines these days, McKenzie is pretty normal. She does have one ability that sets her apart from the rest of us; she\u2019s a shadow reader, someone who can watch a fae \u2018fissure\u2019 (instantly teleport from one location to another) and know exactly where they will reappear. A highly coveted skill when there is a fae civil war going on, which is why McKenzie finds herself being sought after by both sides.Where do I start with all the things I loved about THE SHADOW READER? The fae mythology wasn\u2019t overly complex, but it was unique and perfectly suited to this world. I especially loved the idea of chaos lusters, tiny, visible lightning bolts that dance over the skin under certain circumstances like when fae touch humans. And speaking of touching, the tug-of-war going on with McKenzie\u2019s heart was nothing compared to what I felt. How do you choose between the honorable warrior Kyol loyal to the fae king and the determined rebel leader Aren? Another highlight for me was the constant cloud of doubt I was kept in. I was thrown back and forth suspecting first Kyol then Aren and back again so many times that I got dizzy. Just like McKenzie, I never knew who to fully trust, who to love, or who to align with. And just when I\u2019d think I \u2018d finally figured it out, something would happen and raise the questions all over again. The action was relentless and the emotions kept so sky high that I couldn\u2019t decide until the very end.THE SHADOW READER is a fantastically fun urban fantasy! One of the best debuts of the year and easily my favorite fae urban fantasy since Karen Marie Moning\u2019s Darkfever series. Wonderfully integrated mythology that flowed naturally in the story without needing lengthy explanations, a to die for love triangle, and a relatable non-super woman protagonist who relies on her brain and bravery to fight for what she wants. This is a book that checked off all my urban fantasy wish list boxes and I can\u2019t wait to read the sequel.Sexual Content:Kissing.

Then there's the two love interest AND YES THIS BOOK DOES CONTAIN A LOVE TRIANGLE However I fairly like this love triangle, it served a purposeWe got the good guy who I don't trust. The bad guy who apparently is a good guy but has a certain edge in him.

I can\u2019t think of the last time I\u2019ve gone from completely disliking a book to practically inhaling it. When I first picked up The Shadow Reader, I made it to page 30 before I finally gave up and set it aside. It was over a month before I picked it up again, and the only reason I did was because I wanted it off my reading queue. I can\u2019t say I was eager to dive back into it after disliking the beginning so much. One of my main complaints was the writing style. I was extremely turned off to find that this was in First Person, Present Tense, which was a huge strike against it. I know the POV is author\u2019s choice, but I will never understand the draw of that style. It\u2019s like nails on a chalkboard for me and the story has to be damn good to get me past that. The other thing that bothered me was how stilted and awkward I found the beginning. It was a little confusing being dropped into things like that, but I could have overcome that it if I had felt more of a spark. It just all combined into a generally bad experience. And then something happened. I don\u2019t know what. Either it got better or I was more prepared the second time around. I didn\u2019t bother going back and rereading the first 30 pages\u2014which I\u2019m sure helped\u2014I just jumped straight back in at Chapter Four. And I was hooked. The writing style still felt like a pebble in my shoe, but I found myself reluctantly intrigued by the heroine, McKenzie. I liked that she actually wanted to escape. To the bitter end this girl fought for her freedom. Even when she knew it was doomed for failure, she still got up and tried. I have to appreciate that. Even when she found herself starting to question her loyalty to the Court and slowly becoming attracted to Aren, she didn\u2019t stop. She knew that she couldn\u2019t trust her decisions in a situation like that. When she started muttering to herself about Stockholm Syndrome I had to smile. It was refreshing to find a character that behaved in such a logical way. I don\u2019t have anything against captive/captor relationships, but I find the willingness to trust someone who kidnapped you and who wants to use you pretty hard to swallow. Once they\u2019re out of the situation and able to look at the situation objectively? Sure. But it\u2019s hard to believe during the actual captivity since there\u2019s such a big power imbalance between them. That\u2019s why I loved McKenzie\u2019s attitude. Even when she irritated me, I still liked her for being so believable. When I sat and reflected on this book, I was pretty surprised to realize that it was not very action filled. It was actually pretty slow going. A lot of time is spent on the day to day of McKenzie\u2019s captivity and Aren\u2019s attempts to sway her to their side. But somehow it didn\u2019t feel slow or mundane. The author packed too much emotion and conflict into the story for that. She was also smart to make her action scenes intense enough that they nicely balanced out the slower sections. Williams did a great job showing the disjointed, scattered feel of an actual fight. And she wasn\u2019t afraid to give McKenzie some hard knocks. Quite a few times my eyes were like saucers, wondering if the author was actually going to go there. (The scene on pages 144 - 145 comes to mind) She made McKenzie\u2019s captivity feel very real and uncertain, despite what was growing between her and Aren.Speaking of the bond between them, I was impressed with how the author handled her feelings for both men in her life. I suppose it\u2019s still a love triangle, but it was handled in a completely different way than UF\u2019s usually do. I actually enjoyed it--*gasp!* McKenzie did not dance back and forth between the men, and when she made a decision she didn\u2019t dither, despite how much it hurt. I completely respected the choice that she made. It may have taken her a while to gain the self respect she needed to take a hard look at what she deserved, but she did it. It was so refreshingly healthy! I\u2019m hopeful that the author is going to stick with this and not feel the need to play the usual love triangle game with future books. I am pleased to report that despite this being a series, the author resisted the urge to leave us on a cliffhanger. The plot of this book is resolved and so is the relationship, although there is still room for another book. Yay! I am really stoked about that. I am so sick and tired of cliffhangers. Besides, it wasn\u2019t necessary to hook me into the second book. I am already wishing it was November so I could find out what happens next. If you haven\u2019t given this book a try yet, I recommend you run out and get yourself a copy. :)Favorite Quote: My eyes shoot open when Kyol grabs my arm. Aren holds on a moment more, his lips and hands lingering as if this is his last breath. As if this is the only breath in his life that has ever mattered. Then his eyes lock with the sword-master.\u201cYou have competition now.\u201d *Review originally posted on Fiction Vixen*"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4199122-jamie", "userReview": "[the death of Kelia, which was heart breaking.

Visit my blog!4/4.5 starsI was ridiculously hooked to this book from the very first page. Great characters, exciting storyline, and more important an original storyline. StorylineMcKenzie is a hot commodity in the faerie war. She\u2019s a shadow reader who is able to track faeries that fissure out. She\u2019s been assisting the faerie King since she was 16; it\u2019s now been 10 years. For those past 10 years McKenzie has also been pining over Kyol, the king\u2019s swordsman, who is forbidden from being with a human. They share kisses and private moments but they\u2019ve never gone further as Kyol\u2019s loyalty to the King keeps him from doing so. McKenzie herself has been loyal to the King for the last 10 years and when she is abducted by the faerie rebels and discovers pertinent information that\u2019s been kept from her for all these years her loyalties begin to divide.Single IssueThe emotional bonding with a captor or an abuser known as Stockholm syndrome was referred to in this story after McKenzie began having feelings for Aren. I felt that the fact that she could have had Stockholm syndrome would have been better left implied rather than stated so bluntly. Also, do victims even realize they have Stockholm syndrome? McKenzie kept referring to it almost like it\u2019s a third person. Open for discussion on that because I'm really not sure.\u2019Damn this Stockholm syndrome. There\u2019s got to be some cure for it.\u2019Other than that, I really didn\u2019t have any problems with this story. ThoughtsI\u2019m sure we all know by now how much I despise love triangles and I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels this way. This one wasn\u2019t the worst by far; I believe it was one of the most well-handled love triangles I\u2019ve read to date. I loved the originality of the story. I feared that this would end up being a variation of the Iron Fey series, just with adult alterations. I ended up being quite wrong in that assumption, quite wrong and pleasantly surprised. I also loved how it wasn\u2019t your typical badass heroine stories where she\u2019s unbelievably powerful, super-hot, and can kick everyone\u2019s ass. This was not the case. McKenzie may have had a super awesome power that came in handy and made her super important to a large number of people, but she was still vulnerable and real. At first I was kind of irritated at the fact that she seemed to be a major weenie, but it made the story and McKenzie more realistic in my opinion.I look forward to the next book in the series coming out. The author already released the name of the next book in the series\u2026 \u2018The Shattered Dark\u2019. Sounds fabulous! I can\u2019t wait! :D"}, {"userName": "Ferdy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596358-ferdy", "userReview": "SOME SPOILERS BEWAREMckenzie is a shadow reader, a human with the ability to see fae and track them when they teleport or 'fissure'. Her ability makes her very valuable to the fae especially when there is a war on as the fae use their teleporting abilities to prottect themselves when fighting. Mckenzie since the age of 16 has been helping the fae court to fight the rebel fae who want to replace the king, she has been helping them for 10 years and thanks to her many of the rebel fae have died. Mckenzie has been in love with the king's sword master Kyol for 10 years and is very loyal to him. When Mckenzie is kidnapped by the rebel fae's leader Aren she is very much desperate to get back to Kyol. As she gets to know the rebel fae she begins to doubt what she has been told by them and starts to suspect that she have been used and manipulated by the court. The writing is good and the storyline was pretty interesting but I couldn't give this more than 2 stars because of my dislike of the heroine. Mckenzie was someone I could not relate to AT ALL. She has put her life on hold since she was 16 because she's in love with Kyol - she's spent 8 years at uni and still not got a degree, she only has 1 human friend, she's never been in a relationship. She's been out on the odd date but has never had a boyfriend so yes she's a 26yr old virgin (rolls eyes).. and why because she's so in 'wuv' with Kyol who has told her for the last 10 yrs that they can never be together and to have a relationship with a human alas Mckenzie doesn't listen and begs for any crumbs Kyol throws her way.. she does have eventually have an epiphany and realises she's wasted 10yrs but the epiphany's 9.5 years to late.. I found her love for him quite sweet at times but I lost all respect for her when it's made clear she that made very little effort to connect with anyone else.Mckenzie also went weak at the knees everytime Kyol or Aren touched her or even looked at her.. she sounded like a hormonal teenager not a 26yr old woman. She was very gullible and naive when it came to fae poilitics. She constantly made stupid decisions.. it just got too much. I really could have liked this book if Mckenzie was someone who after been told many times that she could not be with Kyol had actually moved and been in a relationship or two with a human guy instead of pining away for Kyol.. who by the way being a red blood male was probably having sex with other women. Also she should have made an effort to find out about the rebel fae's instead of just believing everything she was told. I think in future books she will probably be stronger as she's now learning more about the fae.Other predictions for future books: *She'll fall more in love with Aren*She'll lose her virginity to Aren and become a nympho overnight*one of Aren's ex-lovers will turn up to cause jealousy, angst and drama*Kyol will pop up and she'll be confused about who she wants*They'll be more fighting and fae politics*Mckenzie and Aren will life-bond and have babies.What I would like to happen (but never will): *She breaks up with Aren to 'find herself'*She stands up for herself more and is not at the beck and call of the fae 24/7.*She dates human guys - has a passionate affair or two, a couple of flings and a steady realtionship with a human guy*She finally finishes her degree and gets a job *She gets more human friends and reconnects with her parents*She finally gets with Aren after living her life more.. they have sex and because she's slept with human guys she can appreciate that Aren is a better lover."}, {"userName": "Mariya", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2959426-mariya", "userReview": "I went into\u00a0 THE SHADOW READER\u00a0not really knowing what to expect and came out blown away by the this incredible fae story.

She is a \"Shadow Reader\", a person able to read shadows left behind from fae who travel from one place to another. For about 10 years she has worked for the court and thought she was working for the good guys and then she is kidnapped by the rebels who are thought to be the bad guys, but are they really?\"I don't want to hurt you,\" the fae's leader says. \"I'd like to talk to you.\" He takes a step toward me. I take a step back.\"Look.\" He sheaths his sword, then holds his hands out, palms up like he's harmless.Screw him. I won't let them take me.\u00a0\u00a0And what's an incredible fae story without some steamy hot love interests? Aren is the rebel leader who wants to keep McKenzie alive because he believes she can be brought over to the rebels side, but McKenzie proves to be quite a stubborn woman. Aren is every woman's wet dream. McKenzie is in love with someone else but Aren doesn't care, he plans to win her over anyway.\"If I were a good man,\" he says, \"I'd acknowledge that Taltrayn is an honorable fae, that he loves you and would take care of you. I'd step down and let you have the man you've always wanted, but, McKenzie, I'm not as good as Taltrayn. I never will be, and I can't step down. I'll fight for the chance to be with you.\"\u00a0\u00a0Mackenzie was really a stubborn heroine and I really liked no matter how much so got threatened by the rebels that she never changed her loyalty, that she really thought about some of her decisions. Even with the decisions with both of the love interests. I really felt her determination and strong will. I think that is one reason our Aren is quite smitten with her.\"Fine,\" he says, his words coming out breathless. \"I'll save your precious sword-master, McKenzie. But I will never, ever give you back to him.\"\u00a0Kyol is the king's sword-master, the man McKenzie truly loves. The thing here is the 10 year wait and still no action between the two. I like Kyol, but I want my hero's in the story to take action and not let their heroine slip from their fingers. Kyol is a good man and dedicated to his king and the court, but I wish he would be a little selfish sometimes for himself.All and all\u00a0THE SHADOW READER\u00a0actually turned out to be quite a exciting and thrilling read.

And amazing. I don't even know how to discuss this rationally, but here goes.McKenzie is a shadow reader, a human who got involved with the fae ten years ago because of her abilities. Namely one, and that is reading shadows, knowing where a fae fissured(think teleported) There's a war going on, and she's firmly on the side of the Court, or better said, on the side of Kyol, the king's sword-master. She's loved him forever, but has never had a chance to be more with him, because the Court forbids it. Now, she just wants to have a completely normal human life. But, fate gets in the way, or precisely, the rebels do.Rebels are on the other side of the war, and McKenzie's enemies, the universal bad guys. Or...are they? She's a captive, but they try to make her see both sides. And one of those trying is Aren...The dashing, charming, sometimes ruthless rebel. One of the leaders of the rebellion, he wants McKenzie to help them. And pretty soon, Mac starts feeling things for him, against her will...\"... No. No way. I don't love Aren. I can't because, damn it, I'm not one of those girls, the ones who have two men chasing after them but can't make up their minds who to choose. If you can\u2019t decide who you love more, you don\u2019t love either of them enough. So I don\u2019t have feelings for Aren, I won\u2019t.\"Of course, that's one of my favorite passages in the book. And it takes us to the love triangle. I have to admit it, it was very well done. I'm not a fan of LTs in general, but here it was different. For one thing, both men are honorable, good, and have genuine feelings for her. I didn't have a side. All I wanted was for it to get resolved without major pain, heartbreak or death. Or, you know, one of them turning villainous. I could genuinely see her dilemma and I'm happy she decided...But, I'm unsure about the ending. I think she may have decided too fast/it was anticlimactic. I mean, I hope that's the end of it, but I wanted to see her thought process and her certainty. In any case, it was well done and I enjoyed even that.I also liked the war side of the story. More specifically, the way McKenzie was forced to see both sides of it, and then decide. Although, I was surprised that the war was resolved, too. Basically almost everything was resolved at the end, and I was expecting cliffhangers, angst and indecision. All in all, I'm not disappointed AT ALL and I can't wait for the next book, coming in October.Note-Buddy read with Anna"}, {"userName": "Amanda Bonilla", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4794704-amanda-bonilla", "userReview": "I've been itching to read this book for months and I was lucky enough to get my hands on it early. I devoured The Shadow Reader in three sittings, and believe me, if I hadn't been distracted by work, I would have read it in a day.The premise is so unique. McKenzie is a human with an extraordinary power: she can read the shadow signatures left behind by the fae as they travel from one location to another. She's a valuable asset to the current fae court, and has been aiding the King in his war against usurpers for years. But McKenzie is kidnapped by the rebels and she soon finds out that there's more than one side to every story.If I could give this book ten stars, I'd do it. Sandy Williams has created a world so vibrant and real, it pulls in you in from the first page. McKenzie is an amazing character: strong and multi-dimensional. The story arc is wonderful and full of suspense! I couldn't get to the next page fast enough. The action is spot on, the fight scenes are articulate and well-written. The world-building is fantastic; intricate and specific without being too overwhelming for the reader. What really sealed the deal for me, however, was the romantic tension. Sandy has crafted the most delicious love triangle. I found myself wondering, who would I choose? And honestly, there was a point when I thought, Hell! I'd take 'em both! The sexual tension is great.

Just this year, I became a huge fan of the genre when I picked up a book that just about every fan of the genre was screaming to the heavens about: Darkfever. Not even so much the actual book, but Jericho Barrons (but the book itself was praised heavily, don't forget). I myself loved it, and have since read two more in the series (and plan on getting my hands on the last two possibly tomorrow!) Then, just yesterday, I finished Richelle Mead's Succubus Blues, and I enjoyed it enough, but mainly for it being light and fun like (most) of her other works. So, I turned on my Kindle immediately after finishing the latter, expecting another enjoyable UF novel, despite hearing that most novels in this genre are garbage, formulatic, and just not worth your time, at least in recent years. The Shadow Reader is a decent book, it was worth my time, but I didn't get much from it. It was pretty standard. We had our main character, McKenzie Lewis, who could see the fae, and was used as a weapon for King Atroth, to track down rebels in a civil war. We had a love triangle going on between Kyol, the king's swordsman that McKenzie has loved since she was sixteen (she's now twenty-six, so she's been waiting for quite some time), and Aren, a rebel fae who kidnaps her in the first two chapters of the novel, and brings her to a rebel hideout, where he teaches her the language of the Fae, and some startling (and possibly true) new sides to this war, bringing in the shades of gray that McKenzie was so blind to until this point. 1. The WritingIt's one of the things I love about this genre. It's simple, yet not too simple that it seems juvenile, but it flows pretty well, and it held my attention. It moves at a fairly brisk pace, but not too fast that anything seems rushed. I enjoyed reading McKenzie's voice, and I felt that the writing had enough personality to it. Still, nothing extraordinary, like Laini Taylor, but decent. 2. The Love TriangleAnnoying. It felt very obvious who McKenzie was going to choose at the end of the novel. The most frustrating part of it was when McKenzie would be thinking about if Aren really loved her when they'd be discussing war strategy. When is that EVER a good time to decide if some guy loves you when you keep insisting that you don't have feelings for him? The fact that so much time was dedictaed to just the wonderings of \"Does he love me?\" or the \"Does he not?\" is lost on me. 3. The \"Kick-Ass\" HeroineUm, I don't know how McKenzie gets this title. Semi-intelligent I guess, but even that is questionable. She never stands up for herself, such as when Aren CUTS HER NECK (I know Barrons is rough around the edges, but he would never do that - he only tried to give Mac ONE tattoo). The most she ever does is say, \"No! I will never help you!\" Anybody can do that. Doesn't make her a kick-ass, independent heroine that I look for in UF. MacKayla Lane (Fever series) is not the strongest character I've ever read. She's pretty good with a spear to kill Unseelie, but I've read stronger (Katniss Everdeen, Saba, Rose Hathaway). However, in the strength department, she makes up for it by being smart, and never letting Barrons push her around, even when it was clear he could break her with his bare hands. McKenzie is flat, umemorable, and a damsel in distress. That cover is very decieving. Not once does McKenzie ever weild a sword, or any weapon. The strongest she is was when she'd be tracking the shadows, and that's not some sign of being strong.4. Aren & KyolKyol = Honorable, boring, overdone, and it was obvious he would get the raw end of the deal.Aren = Asshole, douche, possessive, abusive, prick.5. Overall ThoughtsIt was simply okay. It won't stand out in my mind. It had a predictable love triangle. A heroine trying to be smart and strong, but was really just weak and needed her two hot fae guys to protect her.I'll read The Shattered Dark, but not NEARLY with the same amount of excitement that I came to with this one."}, {"userName": "Layla ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/154308-layla", "userReview": "[(There\u2019s a scene in the book where, ten minutes after she was kissed by Aren, she was making out with Kyol in the back of the car.

Now, I\u2019ve not read much in that particular narrative style, and I do tend to prefer the use of the past tense (in either first- or third-person voice), but it worked well in this case, disappearing behind the meat of the storytelling. (My personal affinity for this style is likely in no small part due to its wonderful use in Ann Aguirre\u2019s Sirantha Jax series. Perhaps it had broken the proverbial dam of my prejudice against 1st POV Present?) In any case, the device lent itself well to the uncertainty of the protagonist\u2019s situation, and to the confusion of the action sequences (of which there were many).Now, a bit of context: McKenzie, a human trying to live as normal a life as possible, possesses the ability to \u201cread\u201d shadows of fae teleportation. The fae, whose own ability to jump between earth and their own parallel dimension equates to considerable power, either greatly appreciate or fear a power like McKenzie\u2019s\u2013after all, she can pinpoint where you\u2019ve gone, allowing any fae to be followed if she\u2019s witnessed the departure. It\u2019s McKenzie\u2019s ability to see the otherwise invisible fae and read their shadows that makes her the perfect ally and the worst kind of enemy.This book is all about perceptions and allegiances. It\u2019s about how these views can differ vastly from one individual to the next, and how they can change with just the smallest bit of truth\u2013or non-truth\u2013introduced. It is what forms the cornerstone of the world building in the series; there is a building discord among the fae that threatens to bubble into civil war, and it\u2019s all due to perceived notions that two major groups have of each other. It was exciting, that feeling of always questioning what\u2019s unfolding on the page. The politics of the fae world are extremely intricate and sometimes elusive, and this story has provided enough of that intrigue and mystery to suggest that it\u2019s the books to follow that will reveal the most crucial revelations.Along those lines, I really enjoyed the concept of a human being whose considerable abilities and long-held allegiances\u2013and the assumed benevolence of both\u2013are thrown into question when some additional perspective is given to her. Though the story is told through McKenzie\u2019s eyes, there is so much unknown and unclear about her and her motives, building a great question mark that the protagonist herself has to untangle. It\u2019s certainly fun watching McKenzie work through her considerable inner turmoil to figure out what she\u2019s been doing for years, and why she\u2019s been doing it.One element that I enjoyed immensely was the interaction between McKenzie and Aren (one of the rebels). Yep, theirs is part of a love triangle (cue groan of distaste if that\u2019s not your bag ^_^)\u2013the relationship between McKenzie and soldier Kyol is somewhat of a shadow itself, already established off-screen and in the distant past\u2013McKenzie\u2019s dealings with Aren are the diametric opposite, and they are the perfect exhibition of how prejudices can be formed, maintained, or broken with small actions and gestures. The sniping, the scuffles, the slowly developing connection\u2026this is where the really interesting emotional drama and tension unfolds.I thought it spoke well to this book that, even after checking the ending just now (which I NEVER do) I was still on pins and needles reading the chapters leading up to the conclusion. The action scenes in general are high-octane, but it\u2019s due to the constant thread of uncertainty that I found myself unsure of\u2026well, anything. I. Love. That. Feeling. ^_^ It formed the very fabric of great drama. And I most certainly cannot wait to delve further into the Shadow Reader world in the next book, The Shattered Dark, out near the end of of 2012."}, {"userName": "Christen (GoldiloxReads and Whimsify)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4652961-christen-goldiloxreads-and-whimsify", "userReview": "\u201cIf I were a good man,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019d acknowledge that he is an honorable fae.....I\u2019d step down and let you have the man you\u2019ve always wanted, but, McKenzie, I\u2019m not as good as him. I never will be, and I can\u2019t step down. I\u2019ll fight for the chance to be with you.\u201dA-MAZ-ING. How is it possible that more people are not talking about this book? I stayed up till four in the morning two nights in a row to read this book.....it was that good. And this is from a debut author? Holy crap, I can't wait to see what else she has in store for us. This book delves into the word of the fae with incredible world building. McKenzie Lewis is a human who has the ability to see fae. She also has a second special ability. When fae 'fissure' (think teleporting, for lack of a better explanation), McKenzie can see the shadows of where they have gone. She can draw a map and lead other fae to the location. This makes her very valuable to the fae king, who has been using Mckenzie as a shadow reader to catch members of the rebels during the war that has been going on in the fae Realm. The king's sword master, Kylo Taltrayn, is McKenzie's handler. The two have secretly been in love for the ten years they have been working together, but have never fully given themselves to each other since fae and human are not supposed to be together and it would cost Kyol his position. The Shadow Reader starts off with a bang when McKenzie is kidnapped by the fae rebels. This is the start of nonstop action that made it difficult to catch my breath - in the best way possible. The rebels are lead by Aren Jorreb, and he has taken McKenzie in the hopes that he can convince her to side with the rebels and read the fissure shadows for them. Little does Aren know that McKenzie has no intention of doing such a thing, and she tries to escape in about a hundred different ways during her stay with the rebels. But the rebels are chipping away at her defense of the fae king and the Court. What if she really has been working for the bad guys all this time?New author Sandy Williams blew me away with her ability to create smart, fully imagined characters. McKenzie is an awesome leading lady. There wasn't one time when I thought she was being stupid or annoying. Her decisions made sense. And the men.....oooooh, the men! The love triangle in this book is the very best kind - there is no right or wrong answer, no smarter choice. Kyol stands for honor and duty. He supports his king, who was also his childhood friend, with unwavering dedication. He's spent the past ten years keeping McKenzie at arm's length for fear their feelings would be discovered. But does he really love her or has he been using her all this time? \"I dedicated my life to my king. I should have dedicated it to you\".Aren is a passionate and confident leader. His quick temper is matched only be his gentleness and his willingness to do anything for his people. His intense stare and sexy smile make it hard for McKenzie to hate him, as does the fact that he continues to heal her after each of her daring escape attempts. But is what he says about the Court true, or is he really the bad guy?\u201cFine,\" he says, his words coming out breathless. \"I'll save your precious sword-master, McKenzie. But I will never, ever give you back to him.\u201dAhhhhhhhh!!! (That's my fangirl scream...). This book was simply amazing. You spend most of the time trying to decide who the bad guy is and who the good guy is, and how on earth this is going to end. The story was spellbinding, addictive, and reminiscent of Moning's Fever series. Even though I can see how a reader might be on either team here, I am literally in love with Aren. Add him to my book boyfriends list! And read this book......NOW!Read more of my reviews at http://goldiloxandthethreeweres.blogs..."}], "description": "There can only be one allegiance.It\u2019s her time to choose.Some humans can see the fae.
