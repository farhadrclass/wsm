They make worlds that never were, populate them with people who never existed, and then invite us to join them in their fantasies. And we do it, don't we? Yes. We PAY to do it.\u201d Thad Beaumont wanted to write from the time he discovered that a person could make a living as a writer. He pounded away at the typewriter so much that his parents were beginning to fear that something was wrong with him. They were right... something is wrong with Thad, but to fully understand what is wrong will take decades to figure out. \nBirds, thousands of them, chittering and flapping their wings, a cacophony of noise. Sparrows in particular. The sounds of them are a precursor to setting off a lightning storm in Thad\u2019s head that leaves him flopping on the ground like a fish trying to find its way back to water. His parents take him to a doctor, and scans show that something is in his head. The surgeon takes that something out of Thad\u2019s head. It is something so unusual that he decides not to tell Thad or his parents. He has saved Thad\u2019s life, and for now that is enough. Thad goes on to write a couple of critically acclaimed books which unfortunately do not do well financially. He teaches to make ends meet, but there is something nagging at him like he has left some unfinished business. He decides to create a pseudonym that will allow him to get these increasingly dark thoughts out of his head and put them on paper. He becomes George Stark, or George Stark becomes him. The separation between them creates no daylight. \nWhile writing as George Stark, he transforms into someone else, someone meaner, someone who likes seeing blood. \u201dCut him. Cut him while I stand here and watch. I want to see the blood flow. Don't make me tell you twice.\u201d Thad Beaumont writes with a typewriter, but George Stark don\u2019t write with no faggoty typewriter; oh no, it is Black Beauty pencils or nothing. The words are etched into the paper like words carved over the doors of the \u201dstone hotels\u201d in which Stark has spent so much time incarcerated.The sparrows are back. The sparrows are flying.Stephen King shares some interesting thoughts about sparrows. Sparrows are so common here in Kansas that they have about the same significance as a blade of grass or a tree leaf. \u201dGatherings of sparrows are rather more ominous\u2026. Sparrows are said to be outriders of the deceased. Which means their job is to guide lost souls back into the land of the living. They are, in other words, the harbingers of the living dead.\u201dLiving dead? Like zombies you might ask? Well, not exactly. When Thad decides to retire George Stark and go back to writing as Thad Beaumont, things start to get weird and not in a wow isn\u2019t that kind of weird way, but more in a OMG someone is killing everyone Thad knows kind of way. And Thad is the number one suspect. It doesn\u2019t take long for Thad to realize that he is involved, that he is the source of the problem. \n\u201dI am the knower. I am the owner. I am the bringer.\u201d\nGeorge Stark doesn't like being dead. He wants just what everybody else wants. He wants to live. \u201dWhen you fuck with him you are fucking with the best.\u201d As things become clear, crazy clear, Thad realizes that he can\u2019t share these revelations with his wife Liz. \n\u201d I\u2019m not going to tell Liz this time, he thought. Be damned if I will. And not just because I\u2019m scared, either...although I am. It\u2019s perfectly simple--not all secrets are bad secrets., Some are good secrets. Some are necessary secrets, and this one is both of those.\u201d\n\nGeorge Stark drives a 1966 Black Oldsmobile Toronado. In college I drove a 1969 White Oldsmobile Toronado. There are differences between the years, but let's just say I understand the power that Stark felt when he was driving that Black Beauty down the road. My father has a 1966 Black Toronado he is having restored. I hope he doesn\u2019t turn into George Stark!!!When Stephen King writes about writers, it is simply irresistible. I don\u2019t know if there is another writer on the planet who understands all the nuances of being a writer, a famous writer, better than King. He conjures things out of his mind that scare the hell out of millions of people every time he releases a new book. His nightmares have nightmares. As King taps into the dark side of himself to find those horrors, I think he has met his George Stark. This evil doppelganger feeds him with the images that become words that become horrors made out of the worst of human impulses. I guess the question he has to ask himself is will these feathered soul catchers come for him someday. The day after I finished reading this book I opened the garage to take out a bag of trash before heading to work, and hundreds of birds exploded over my head flying just a few feet over the top of my house. They were sparrows, providing me with one last bone deep chill that brushed skeletal fingers down my spine.

Something I likely wouldn't have picked up on my own as I'd somehow missed this King novel. So glad I did as I enjoyed it much more than expected. As always, SK is a genius at creating characters who are flawed, intriguing, and yet somehow redeeming. I now need to hunt down the film version to compare notes on how it varies from the book.

Injurious things then start to happen....grotesque murders begin, and most ominous of all....\"The sparrows are flying again.\"Overall, I really enjoyed this one albeit thought it a bit drawn out. Was actually torn between three and four stars for a good while, but that extra dose of KING weird with the scads of creepy birds late in the story, and the final warning nudged my rating up.\n(some gore and super ickiness in this one folks)"}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "When someone discovered literary writer Thad Beaumont was also crime writer George Stark and tried to blackmail him, Beaumont and his wife decided to go public and kill off George Stark themselves. But when the pseudonym takes on a life of his own and starts killing people connected to Thad, can anything stop him?I read this sometime in that hazy dawn of time before Goodreads. Since we had a trip to Maine coming up, I decided to read it again.The Dark Half is an underrated book. Thad Beaumont had a parasitic twin removed from inside his skull when he was 12. Since then, he's become a critically acclaimed literary writer and a blockbuster crime writer under the pseudonym George Stark, who goes on a murderous rampage when Thad kills him off.This is one of those books where the main character is the least interesting one. Alan Pangborn is a great viewpoint character and a lot more interesting than Thad. He's a small town sheriff trying to do his job despite some crazy shit happening. Basically, The Dark Half is Parker chasing down Donald Westlake. Since I've read all 23 Parker books Richard Stark wrote since the first time I read this, the reread was a much richer experience. I noticed some Richard Stark influence in the George Stark chapters. Also, I enjoyed the Creepshow reference, although I might have to check the timeline to see which one actually came first. \"Call me Billie, everyone does!\"Aside from the psychopomp business with the sparrows and Stark falling apart, The Dark Half is pretty much a crime book. It doesn't feel nearly as long winded as some of King's books and the ending didn't suck for once. George Stark was a chilling villain and since I forgot the ending, I had no idea if Thad would live or not. Four out of five stars."}, {"userName": "Sr3yas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23097409-sr3yas", "userReview": "3.5 Stars\nWhat inspires an author to write a story?\nWithout question, King is a man with tremendous imagination. He took inspiration for The Shining when he stayed in a deserted hotel along with his wife, and he wrote Pet Sematary after King and his family stayed a year near an actual Pet Sematary in Orrington.But for The Dark Half, his inspiration was a lot closer to home.King wrote couple of novels under pseudonym \nRichard Bachman\n in 70s and 80s. But in 1985, a bookstore clerk figured Bachman is King and wrote an article about it with King's blessing. In short, The cat was out of the bag.Wait, Mild Spoilers AheaaaaaaadFour years after, in 1989, King wrote The Dark Half: A dark tale where a novelist with pseudonym reveals his secret identity to the public and vows not to write another novel under that particular pen name. But the pen name AKA his Dark Half doesn't like that.... NOT ONE BIT. So that high toned son of a bitch takes a human form and starts killing everyone who was involved in exposing his identity and more!I think the bookstore clerk who exposed Bachman had a heart attack after reading this novel. \n\nThe Sparrows are flying.\n\n\nThe Dark half is the next level of Jekyll and Hyde:\n Thad Beaumont is a novelist who writes novels in his own name as well as a pseudonym. The works of his Pseudonym, George Stark is grittier, ruthless and more famous, just like the personality of George Stark envisioned by Thad. But Thad knows George Stark is not just a pseudonym or just a fragment of his imagination, he could feel Stark's exertion over him when he writes stark novels. Thad can feel a dark person lives inside him, who surfaces only to write Stark's bloody novels.\nThe Dark half is a wicked version of Frankenstein and his monster:\n When Thad kills off Stark finally, Stark comes back from the dead like Frankenstein's monster. Hyde is no longer imprisoned in Jekyll's body, but he has his own form and control! And like Frankenstein's monster, Stark starts his rampage to kill everyone connected to him and his creator.\nThe Dark half is Cape fear with crazier Max Cady:\n When it comes to planning, torturing and murdering, there is no one as good as Stark. He is a killer and he is gonna get you, hoss.The story is divided into three parts. Part one is the longest, bloodiest and most enjoyable of them all. I literally flew through part one in a matter of hours. It's even more surprising for me because I've always found King's initial chapters slow as he uses these chapters to build his characters. But boy oh boy, this book did not dilly dally on those and went straight to action!Part two considerably slowed down the pace, only to pick it up as the chapters progressed.\nDark half is a high octane physiological horror ride: An extremely fun, yet flawed ride.\nThe major issue with the story is the plot itself: It is something worthy of Goosebumps, not an actual adult novel. A man who has never existed coming to life? Then he slowly losing his shape because he is not real? And the only way to become real is by learning how to write?Every time I was at the edge of the seat reading the horror, one of these less savvy plot point shows its face, effectively killing the mood. *I can't control my hand!*I even found some lazy writing here! At the beginning, King introduces Thad as not a laughing man. Guess what he does most of the book? Laugh! And the whole relationship of Thad and his family with Sheriff Alan felt odd! The story is set in the 80s and there are a lot of 80s techs which was unintentionally funny. Like waiting for a computer analysis for a whole day, IBM machines and dialogues like:\n\n\u275d The babies are insurance. Like write-protect on a floppy disk, isn\u2019t that so, Thad?\u275e\n\nNevertheless, I bow down in front of a sheer wicked imagination of King. Even though the names of characters were different, we all know that the story is about King and Bachman, where Bachman is a homicidal maniac on a rampage. I loved the dedication and dust cover of this book.Bachman is still at large. Well played, Mr. King, Well played.I would recommend this to King fans looking for a different type of high! And finally, Shout out to Craig AKA LoneTiger for a fantastic buddy read. And to clarify, no sparrows were harmed during our buddy read!"}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "Stephen King once wrote some books under the pen name Richard Bachman, but the gag was blown by a book store clerk in 1985. In The Dark Half, a writer using a pen name is exposed and a murderous rampage occurs as a result with numerous victims getting killed in a variety of gruesome ways, including one guy getting beaten to death with his own prosthetic arm. Uh\u2026Mr. King? I can assure you that I have no interest at all in revealing any secret of yours that I may accidently come across someday. I promise.Thad Beaumont is a college professor and writer with a wife and baby twins. Thad writes very serious literature and was a National Book Award nominee for his first novel. Unfortunately, he never really found commercial success and got a fat case of writer\u2019s block along the way. So Thad comes up with the pen name, George Stark, that he uses to write gory crime novels, and those books all become popular best sellers. Part of the Stark mystique is the elaborate history Thad devises for him with George sharing a lot of characteristics with the ruthless killer who is the star of the books.When someone threatens to blow the whistle about who Stark really is, Thad beats them to the punch by going public and declaring that he\u2019s tired of George Stark and will no longer write the crime novels. However, a lot of people connected with ending the Stark name start getting killed. And how can Thad\u2019s fingerprints be all over the crime scenes even though he was hundreds of miles away? Apparently George Stark is a little more real than Thad thought. And he\u2019s very pissed off.If you ever get into discussions about King\u2019s books with his fans, The Dark Half doesn\u2019t get mentioned a lot, and that\u2019s a shame because I think it\u2019s one of his most underrated books. It\u2019s obvious that the idea was inspired by King\u2019s own use of a pen name, and it\u2019s one of the first books that King really started digging into the idea of what it means to write and create something. Those are themes he\u2019d come to explore a lot more in later years, but when Thad asks himself, \u201cWho am I when I write?\u201d, you can feel King pondering that question himself.This feels a little bit different from some other King books because it's a hybrid of crime and horror. As always with King, he starts throwing in more detail than he needs to, and it probably would have been a better book if he trimmed a hundred pages. I still think it\u2019s one of his better efforts and that Stark is one of his scarier villains.I also have a soft spot for this one because it led me to another writer who became one of my favorites. During the story, while Thad is giving an interview about how he came up with George Stark, he mentions being inspired by Donald Westlake using Richard Stark as a pen name for his Parker crime novels. I\u2019d never even heard of Westlake back then in those caveman days before the internet or Amazon, but I thought he sounded interesting so I eventually tracked some of his books down and have been a fan since.Not as good as The Stand or Salem\u2019s Lot or The Dead Zone, but a helluva lot better than Rose Madder or Desperation, this is one that I think should get more attention from King fans."}, {"userName": "Delee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6168268-delee", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Shanti", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188863-shanti", "userReview": "Short read and my first Stephen King book.

If you want to read more, I recommend checking this book out for yourself.This was a pretty good read that I did as a goodreads book buddy buddy read with two of my goodreads book buddy friends Chelsea and Kelly. Though I had seen the film a while back, this was my first time reading this book. I am no stranger to the Master of the Macabre Stephen King as I first checked out his books when I discovered Cycle of the Werewolf which one of my favorite horror films \"Silver Bullet\" is based on. Entranced, I decided to read a few Stephen King books a year and from the few books I have read of his, I have enjoyed them. This book was a wild and spine-tingling ride. King pulls you into his world and doesn't stop until you reach the end. If you liked Stephen King's books or if this is your first foray into King's maniacal world, I recommend checking out this book or any of his old work first before venturing on to his newer stuff because you will enjoy it. This book is available at your local library to check out as well as on amazon and wherever books are sold.Note to Chelsea and Kelly: Thank you for participating with me in my first goodreads book buddy buddy read. This was a lot of fun. I hope you guys enjoyed this book. If you would like to do this again with another book, please let me know by private message.

Thaddeus Beaumont (what a great name) is a writer of average success; George Stark is a writer of wondrous success; but Thad and George are the same person. And what happens when your pseudonym that you've tried to lay to rest somehow claws his way up from the grave and goes on a murderous rampage? King's here to tell you!.Based (hopefully loosely) on his own experience of writing as Richard Bachman, King once again delivers a great read centred around a writer and the art of writing, and I loved the idea that all writers have another person, a dark half, inside them....In my opinion some of the most startling and vivid imagery of the Kings I've read so far feature in this book, such as the rapid decomposition of George Stark as he rots away, and the image of millions of sparrows gathering for their sinister purpose. I don't think I'll ever look at a sparrow the same way again. .I also loved the characters, especially Liz and Alan Pangborn! Excited to see more of Alan in Needful Things!.4.5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Paul Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7553206-paul-nelson", "userReview": "Thad Beaumont is a writer, not a very successful one it has to be said, not until he started to write under the Pseudonym George Stark, a definitive change in direction to something altogether darker and that's what brings the money in. Now it's time to out the Stark and via people magazine, the Pseudonym is finally laid to rest, fake grave and all.The only problem, George Stark isn't quite ready to rest in peace.As with my other early King reviews I'll talk about what I liked and disliked about The Dark Half, so there may well be spoilers if you've not read this but I think the vast majority of you devoured this a long time ago.The best thing about this book is the murderous journey of the 'high toned son of a bitch' George Stark, he's the presence you keep hoping to return to even though you can sort of guess where it's all going. His rampage, unbelievable to most of the authorities, remember the fingerprints but gripping to the reader contained some of my favourite parts of the book.Just a dream.'I\u2019m not done with you, cock-knocker, George Stark said softly from behind him. His voice was no longer smiling. His voice was as cold as Castle Lake in November. Remember that. You don\u2019t want to fuck with me, because when you fuck with me\u2026.'One of my favourite parts of the book was at the apartment of Frederick Clawson, the guy who was planning the big reveal about George Stark. The terror elicited from the journey of Dodie Eberhart, from the front door to the scene of the crime and the click of the door shutting, the realization that the killer had been behind her, was absolutely phenomenal. Superb writing, I have to say.'Dodie Eberhart raised her voice to its maximum decibel level, windows cracked, the eardrums of small children ruptured, and dogs fell dead.'And that's before she even gets to the murder scene.The whole sparrow thing was brilliantly told and bought about the perfect ending, there's a mythology around the sparrows of course carrying the souls of the dead and this brings another creepy element to the story, even though I hate, hate and yes hate the word Psychopomp. Can't help but say it with an intense feeling of distaste, that's just me though. The whole sparrows almost parting to walk through thing is chilling on its own.Alan Pangborn, the sheriff of Castle Rock is the glue that holds this story together even if his revelation gained from the eventual phone call to the retired surgeon who operated on young Thad was a touch, well unrevelationary (is that made up, sounded right to me). Stark is the firework that holds the attention and Thad is the failed party popper, Mr reliable and decidedly plain.So my main gripe with this story was the main character Thad Beaumont, I just didn't feel him and I've said it before with Jake Epping from 11/22/63 and Johnny Smith from the Dead Zone. The main difference between these three king novels though is the bad guy, George Stark is leaps and bounds ahead of Lee Harvey Oswald and Greg Stillson as a dread inducing entity. Danger and malevolence seep from the pores of George Stark, a seemingly unstoppable supernatural force on a mission to save himself.Honestly though this is a brilliant story idea, very well executed but in my eyes lacking just a little with the characterization, I think it will interesting to see where the switch comes, which novel is the turning point that shows the brilliant characterization of things like Joyland and his more recent stuff with the straight up fantastic story telling. The difference in style from his new to older stuff is still apparent though at this point and I definitely prefer the style of his new stuff, although many won\u2019t agree.And this passage, fucking spiders.\u2018Stark sliced upward, splitting the crotch of Eddings\u2019s beige trooper uniform, splitting his scrotal sac, drawing the razor up and out in a long, buttery stroke. Eddings\u2019s balls, suddenly untethered from each other, swung back against his inner thighs like heavy knots on the end of an unravelling sash-cord. Blood stained his pants around the zipper. For a moment he felt as if someone had jammed a handful of ice cream into his groin . . . and then the pain struck, hot and full of ragged teeth. He screamed.\u2019 Also posted at http://paulnelson.booklikes.com/post/..."}, {"userName": "Bill Khaemba", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41380936-bill-khaemba", "userReview": "I Promised you a review :)\n\n\u201c...he was, after all, a novelist...and a novelist was simply a fellow who got paid to tell lies. The bigger the lies, the better the pay.\u201d\n\nFirst of all with any \nStephen King\n book the reader must understand that they will be freaking traumatised to some extent and you won\u2019t be able to put down his book until the end. So it\u2019s the best conundrum or maybe the worst. The book itself has the classic King vibe to it, a malevolent haunting story which features a protagonist who is a writer (similar to The Shining, Misery etc. both which I highly recommend) and boy was it a ride\u2026Thad (the protagonist) was a struggling writer after he shifts gears and decides that he will use a new pseudonym (George Stack)\u2026 BOOM!

After two years he kind of tries to bury George Stack and go back to his own stuff but what he doesn\u2019t know is the coffin won\u2019t close.The sparrows are flying again...I have to say that King has this ability to sort of make the reader question\u2026 Is this actually real?? Or Can this happen??And that is true horror in my eyes. I love scaring myself shitless, it\u2019s the thrill but King manages to elevate my fears to a whole other level.

It's not all new info, but I didn't know about Guy Pilsbury. If you know who that is (or should have been), you get a cookie. Also, I cannot promise there won't be spoilers, but I will try my best.Okay, we're all clear that Stephen King once wrote under the pen name Richard Bachman, right? Good. And if you didn't know, now you know. Bachman is probably one of the most famous pseudonyms ever created. King didn't do a very good job of hiding the fact that he was Bachman, though, because most people thought Bachman was ripping off King, both in style and content. King simply wanted to publish more than once a year, and back then such epic feats of daring do just didn't happen. Publishers pubbed one book a year from an author because people read slower in the dark ages. Or some shit. I don't know. (The only jokes I got are bad ones...) Which brings me to some really cool six-degrees-of-separation type goings-on within The Dark Half. Dig on this: Stephen King killed Richard Bachman in much the same way that Thad Beaumont kills off George Stark in this novel; by having a fake funeral for the guy. Bachman supposedly died of cancer, and is survived to this day by his wife Claudia Inez Bachman (a fictional woman who keeps finding manuscripts tucked away in the attic -  The Regulators, Blaze). But, did you know that Richard Bachman was not always Richard Bachman? King's first choice for a pen name was Guy Pilsbury, which was also King's grandfather's name. Why did he change it? I'll get to that. First, let's discuss another author by the name of Donald E. Westlake. Donald E. Westlake is mentioned in The Dark Half not only because Westlake had a famous pen name, but because King took part of that pen name to create his own. You see, during the copyright process, somebody mistakenly put King's name AND Guy Pilsbury's name on the paperwork, so the person submitting the paperwork had to call King. King had to come up with a new name on the fly. First name to come to mind was Westlake's, but not Westlake himself, Westlake's pen name, which was Richard Stark. At the time of the phone call, King was listening to Bachman Turner Overdrive, so he threw the two names together. Richard Bachman. Now, fast forward to The Dark Half. The pen name that comes to life inside this book is George Stark. Richard Stark/Richard Bachman/George Stark. Obvious connections are obvious.If you want to hear the Guy Pilsbury story yourself, here's the interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ_S8...Anyfuck, I love this book because it's a fictionalized piece of King's life with a heavy dose of the weird and the supernatural piled on top. It's lean, mean, and far from clean. One of King's more brutal works. But, overall, it's simply big fun.

Ready? This book was written by Stephen King as Stephen King not too long after the \"death\" by exposure of his pseudonym Richard Bachman. The story is about an author, Thad Beaumont, who, under similar circumstances, has just laid to rest his own successful pseudonym, George Stark. Trouble is, George Stark isn't too keen on going quietly into the night. And George Stark can be one high toned son of a bitch. \nI love it when King writes about writers (John Irving has a similar knack for this). I'm in the infancy of becoming a true \nConstant Reader\n, so my scope of King Canon isn't quite complete, but this brought together flavors and queries I savored in both \nMisery\n and \nThe\n Shining\n. The protagonists are plagued by an uncertainty around who exactly is running the show.Not being a writer myself, there are pieces that I enjoy simply as voyeur. However, the screw 'em all, unsustainable but going too fast to care characteristics of George Stark or Jack Torrance when the boiler begins to creep lie somewhere within us all. That moment of realizing that your brain, your impulses might not be on your side, might, in fact, be pedal to the metal steering you off a cliff, roadblocks be damned- well, perhaps it's more familiar to some than others."}, {"userName": "Ruth Turner", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17861817-ruth-turner", "userReview": "Audiobook \u2013 Narrated by Grove Gardner \u2013 Excellent narration.I enjoyed this audio very much.

It took me longer than expected, but I made it. Overall, I had a damn good time. The 1980s was, arguably, King's most successful decade \u2014 at least as far as commercial appeal goes. He was a literary Bruce Springsteen, Led Zeppelin, et cetera. He was at the top of the bestselling lists and hit movie after hit movie adapted from his works was being released in theaters. He was, officially, a household name. During those years his kids got older; he became addicted to drugs and got clean (a process that casts a hue on almost every release from this period); he collaborated with Peter Straub on a fantasy novel and kicked the Dark Tower series into gear. It was a very productive time for King.As I said, I had a good time rereading the releases from this decade. The point of my doing this is to see how my opinions change over time. That happens a lot, at least for me. I tend to read quickly and skim over things, so rereading novels is almost always beneficial. Firestarter was much better than I had previously thought; my opinion on Christine soured tremendously upon rereading. Stephen King's works are more subtle than they appear; multiple takes are almost always fruitful. So, The Dark Half. Released in 1989, this novel was SK's farewell to the '80s. It encapsulates so many motifs that had popped up in previous King works (a writer/family man as the protagonist, the theme of addiction and outrunning your desires, et cetera) that it, at first, seems borderline repetitive. It even partially takes place in Ludlow (town of Pet Sematary). The rest is set in Castle Rock. Talk about returning to familiar stamping grounds! (Not that I'm complaining; I love both of those towns.) Hell, this book was in my bottom 5 for years and years. I thought it was a bit of a bore, I thought King's writing was clunky, and . . . of course, I could never quite figure out what, exactly, George Stark is. King doesn't spell it out; he leaves some of the heavy lifting to the reader, which is . . . odd for him. He usually revels in explaining the how's and why's of his creations; here it is left up to interpretation. I believe Thad Beaumont has a \"wild talent,\" thanks to the absorption of his twin in utero (which developed in his brain as Thad himself developed). The impact this had on his neurotic development puts him amongst characters such as Carrie White, Danny Torrance, Charlie McGee, Johnny Smith, et cetera. Thad's power is, of course, his wild imagination, his tendencies to imaginatively create, and the uncontrollable-when-triggered ability to extract and transform ideas into matter that physically impacts the world around him. By the story's end, as George is falling apart and desperate to live and succeed on his own, it is apparent that Thad's talent is not perfect and can be wildly unpredictable. There is much, much more I would like to say about this (for I feel I've done a piss poor job of explaining my theory), but Goodreads does have a review word limit. Boo! Once I got more of a handle on what George Stark is (or possibly is, anyway), I was able to enjoy the ride much more. This is one of King's leanest and meanest novels; it's a nasty, bloody, thrilling affair with copious amounts of horror and crime investigation \u2014 more than enough to keep any reader turning the pages. However, gentler readers be warned: this one is not for the faint of heart. It's a gloriously gory book, and King doesn't shy away from every nasty detail. This was quite a welcome change after biggies like It and The Tommyknockers. I don't quite know yet if this is now in my top 10, but it just might be. King's exploration of art and addiction (two themes he goes back to again and again) is most compelling; he is not afraid to be bleak and 'go there'; this novel's ending struck me hard \u2014 the bad guy loses, but the good guys lose too. In this novel, there is no winning. Only the grim hope of possibly recovering from the carnage. King Connections As I said before, a lot of The Dark Halftakes place partially in Castle Rock, placing this firmly in the same universe as The Dead Zone, Cujo, et cetera. References to those novels abound. The Beaumont's winter home is in Ludlow, Maine, which is where the Creed family lives in Pet Sematary.Pg. 72 - Juniper Hill, a mental asylum first referenced in IT gets a mention.At one point, Deputy Norris Ridgewick refers to himself as a lunkhead. Is that a wink and a nod to Creepshow? I'll say yes. Favorite Quote \"No, you don't,  Alan thought. You don't understand what you are, and I doubt that you ever will. Your wife might . . . Although I wonder if things will ever be right between the two of you after this, if she'll ever want to understand, or dare to lose you again. Your kids, maybe, someday . . . But not you, Thad. Standing next to you is like standing next to a cave some nightmarish creature came out of. The monster is gone now, but you still don't like to be too close to where it came from. Because there might be another. Probably not; your mind knows that, but your emotions \u2014 they play a different tune, don't they? Oh boy. And even if the cave is empty forever, there are the dreams. And the memories. There's Homer Gamache, for instance, beaten to death with his own prosthetic arm. Because of you, Thad.

Actually I'm a huge Stephen King fan, so giving this only 2 1/2 stars went against a lot of the personal feelings and experiences I've had over the years reading his amazing novels.  I really wanted to enjoy this book, and just like anything else in life sometimes you just have to listen to your instincts and after 150 pages in the bucket I should've called it a day...but being the forever optimist I just trudged ahead.  The book revolves around Thad Beaumont, a novelist (SK writing about himself perhaps?) Who finds national fame after he writes a series of books under a pseudonym name. What's unique about Thad, is that at five years old he was having recurrent headaches and neurosurgeons had to remove a tumor from his brain that was actually ectopic human tissue that was found in his brain matter! Oh, poor Thad had a little brother **gasps**  Only Stephen King to think of the shit up!!  What follows is a hot mess of a story where Thad's little brother 'materializes' into a real human being and starts killing everybody! I'll tell you the violent scenes are very well crafted, and King's brilliance really shines as he makes the mundane turn into horror. The book has all the right ingredients to work: a sick twisted plot that comes to a crescendo conclusion at the end, some very dark violence scenes and Stephen kings prolific and unique writing style. What really kills the 'Dark Half' is the turtle slow pace of the book with multiple unnecessary characters and sideline bullshit plots which add nothing to the story! Also the book was written in the early 1980s early in Stephen King's career. The dialogue between Thad, his wife and this annoying local sheriff was also incredibly cheesy and at times actually comical! The overall effect was of a comedic story rather than a horrifying and gripping story. No what you're seeing is not some cheesy zombie character in the picture above. This is actually a scene from a movie adaption to 'Dark Half. To top it off 'Dark Half' was actually made into a B-movie in the early 1990s. The box office tanked big-time and after's watching some clips on the Internet I can see why. Hollywood turned a mediocre story into a blood fest which many horror fans will recognize as a frighteningly mediocre movie. 2 1/2 Stars"}, {"userName": "Tom Swift", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31185245-tom-swift", "userReview": "Really good.

I realize now why that was, probably because teen me was bored reading parts of this as adult me was now. I do think that parts of the book are fairly good (I loved the sparrows and the growing realization of who George Stark was) but think that the book gets bogged down a ton with way too much talking that goes nowhere and an ending that kind of fizzles. You end up having to read the other Castle Rock books in order to find out what happens to the characters mentioned in this one which is okay, but does make it that \"The Dark Half\" is not a true standalone book. \"The Dark Half\" was written in response to when Stephen King was outed as writing as Richard Bachman. I have to say that \"The Dark Half\" really does read like a Bachman book (go read \"The Long Walk,\" \"The Running Man,\" and \"The Regulators\"). Most of those works seemed to have violence for violence sake. Not my favorite of King's works, but still interesting. \"The Dark Half\" is mostly brutal with parts broken up by characters talking to each other about things we as readers are already privy to. So most of the book you are just waiting for everyone to figure out things and for the ending to come.  \"The Dark Half\" is about author Thad Beaumont who has recently come out and admitted that he has written under the name of George Stark for years. Thad and his wife decide to declare George Stark dead after a man tries to shake them down for money to keep their secret hidden that he really is George Stark. Thad has started to find some success writing under his own pen name and thinks now is a good time to lay Stark to rest. Unfortunately, someone takes significant pains to go out and murder anyone connected with the \"death of George Stark.\" When all signs point to Thad or someone close to him being responsible for these deaths, Thad starts wondering if someone is delusional enough to think that they are really George Stark. The character of Thad intrigued me in this one. I do feel bad about what ends up happening to him (see \"Needful Things\" and \"Insomnia\"). Thad has a good life and when you realize his connection to \"George Stark\" I ended up being moved to mostly pity for the guy.The other characters in this one come in and out and don't really sing to me. We have Thad's wife Liz that felt like an afterthought after the first couple of hundred pages. I wished for more from that character.Sheriff Alan Pangborn I honestly didn't care for in this one. I liked him much better in \"Needful Things\" he is also referenced down the line in \"Bag of Bones.\" I think the issue for me is that the sheriff blames Thad for what has occurred, but I didn't and thought it was weird how the book ended. We also get a plethora (not really but it felt like it) of characters who ended up being murdered by George Stark and reading all of their bad ends was gruesome after a while.The writing was okay, but as I said, there was way too much talking going on. I found myself really bored after we get to Part II: Stark Takes Charge. Also since I had this in paperback format, it was hard to read some of the writing that was included in this book that was in cursive and showing what Thad and Stark's writing looked like. I honestly wish I had a magnifying glass.The setting of this book is pretty familiar to Constant Readers. We are back with Castle Rock, Maine the site of some insanity that has gone on in many a King book. I always wonder why people never move away from that place. The first book in the Castle Rock series would be \"Cujo\". After \"The Dark Half\" you can read \"Needful Things\" where you can follow up with Sheriff Alan Pangborn and hear about Thad Beaumont again. The ending was a meh to me. I mean I liked how King dealt with the problem of George Stark. It sounded awesome and terrifying (I will never look at sparrows the same way again) but it just took way too long to get there."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1418580-wendy", "userReview": "A wild, crazy and creepy Stephen King novel!

You just don't have the sense to lie down.\"Thad Beaumont is an author that's not very successful, however under his pen name \"George Stark\" he writes highly successful books about a violent killer called Alexis Machine. Following an article in People magazine in which he admits to being George Stark and taking part in a photo shoot with a fake grave, Stark himself comes to life and goes on a killing rampage before targeting Beaumont himself.This book is clearly a reference to King's own pseudonym, Richard Bachman. In response to being asked where he get his ideas, King replied \"it seems to me that for most writers there really is another person hiding inside\". In The Dark Half itself, he writes, \"He is two men - he has ALWAYS been two men. That's what any man or woman who makes believe for a living must be. The one who exists in the normal world...and the one who creates worlds. They are two. Always at least two.\" I was glad to read a King book again that is considered \"horror\" even though I don't find many books that scary. The descriptions of George Stark are detailed and stomach-churning, as are his murders. Stark himself is petrifying, his appearance as well as his murderous rage and petrifies - a great character developed by King. I also liked the back story as to where Stark came from, and loved how King reflected this in Thad's twins and their similarities. As for the sparrows, I love this aspect of the story - so creepy. My slight annoyances with this book are plot lines like cops deciding to go and investigate alone - why? Instances like this just don't feel like realistic and serve just to further the story.

The premise of an author's abandoned pseudonym coming back from the grave to claim it's own glory is still rather awesome and I find this to be an extremely entertaining story, but it's not nearly as riveting as I had in mind. Thad Beaumont and the rest of the cast of characters are fantastic as is par for the course for almost any King novel and I would read stories about his characters even if the storylines weren't as good as King's usually tend to be. The Dark Half is a fast-paced book and keeps the reader going by the sheer force of the crazy events taking place in Thad Beaumont's life. In this case, I almost felt that things were happening a bit to fast and crazy at times and that I needed to slow it down a bit myself in order to better enjoy the novel as a whole. Maybe it's because I HAD read this one before, but at times the pace almost seemed to be a bit overwhelming and I just wanted some sort of an aside to calm things down for a little bit.Overall, a very enjoyable novel (even on the re-read) and one that I'll pick up again one day down the road."}], "description": "The Dark Half", "title": "The Dark Half", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228191.The_Dark_Half", "average": 3.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437409924l/228191.jpg", "reviews": 1559, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King", "name": "Stephen King"}], "type": ["Horror", "Fiction", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228191.The_Dark_Half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25013418-the-dark-half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28111712-the-dark-half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28251808-the-dark-half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8136157-the-dark-half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6599011-the-dark-half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/542820.The_Dark_Half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11597.The_Dark_Half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28634374-the-dark-half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2309543.The_Dark_Half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9850124-tamna-polovica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13448.The_Dark_Half", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11588.The_Shining", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149267.The_Stand", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10614.Misery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43615.The_Gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10592.Carrie"]}
