I also was eager to know what was happening with those she left behind.Reading more like a mystery/suspense novel than a romantic suspense book I was a little disappointed with how the author chose to play things out. She pretty much casts everyone, with the exceptions of Rylan and Gentry, in an unflattering light and added suspicion where it didn't need to be. It was too much. This book had the potential to be so much more.A few questions remain unanswered for me and a few scenerios and people were introduced to no purpose at the end of this tale. Will they prove purposeful in the next book? I will have to wait and see.Rylan and Destry get their happily ever after but it came too late for me. There wasn't any relationship building in between all their amateur sleuthing. There weren't enough sparks for two people who have spent the last 11+ years longing for one another.I hope now that the big mystery has been solved Redemption will prove to be more well rounded and less sinister.Cherise Everhard, January 2013Book provided by and reviewed for the Amazon Vine program"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1127488-susan", "userReview": "Excellent book. Eleven years after his sister's murder and the end of his romance with Destry, Rylan has returned to Beartooth. He's tired of living on the road. When Destry's brother Carson, who was suspected of Ginny's murder, returns, Rylan is determined to find the proof to put him behind bars. This puts him in conflict with Destry yet again, as she is still certain of Carson's innocence. I liked both Rylan and Destry. Rylan had some real tunnel vision when it came to Carson, he was so sure that he was responsible. When he saw Destry again, he realized that he still loved her, but was just as convinced that there was no future for them. I liked the way that he actually started to listen to her when she told him that maybe he hadn't looked at all the facts. It didn't take long before he and Destry started working together to try to find out the truth. I liked the way that Destry was so comfortable in her role on the ranch. She knew that she was happy there. She also had a very rocky relationship with her father, the reason for which comes out later in the book. When her brother returns she is determined to prove him innocent. She also has to find a way to help him deal with his other problems. As she and Rylan work together she admits that she has never stopped loving him. They have to decide if their love can overcome all the obstacles. I liked the longer length of this book. It allowed for more characters and more depth of character. There were quite a few twists and turns that had me guessing as to the identity of the murderer. I'm really looking forward to the next book."}, {"userName": "Jonel Boyko", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15432163-jonel-boyko", "userReview": "Once again Daniels brings her world and her characters to life in a way that dares you to try and ignore them. I was emotionally engaged from the first page, but not overwhelmingly so. The multiple mysteries that wind their way through the novel add to the overarching who-dun-it plot. The suspense was riveting and the rekindled romance was so genuine that I couldn\u2019t help but wish for the same for myself.The characters in this novel really made my day. Daniels took everyday individuals and placed them in situations that made them so much more. The well-developed main characters not only had a history between them, but situations to overcome that seemed so very daunting. Daniels\u2019 diverse character development doesn\u2019t stop there. I enjoyed getting to know various members of the town as if they were my own neighbours. I love the fact that some of the characters are the type of people that you instinctively want to get to know better, while others get on your nerves from the get-go. It makes it so much more real. Personally I found Nettie to be an irksome busybody. She does add a great deal to the story, but her personality grates on me. I love Daniels' writing, and so far, this series is no exception.

It is filled with the highs and lows of human emotion and also includes the web of friendship as well as the tenterhooks that bind people together--their human weaknesses, their foibles, their urges that take them in directions that can only mean personal disaster and relational destruction. The reader also comes away from the story with a deep awareness of the vast plains of Montana, the sense that calling it Big Sky Country is more than accurate and lots of reasons that those who have roots there can never really go anywhere else. A terrific book from a writer who has wowwed her readers with multiple fine pieces of romance literature. Not heavily erotic and the love scenes are very lightweight, but there is heavy emotion all through this book and it is one that will keep the reader on the tips of one's toes throughout."}, {"userName": "Dee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2177726-dee", "userReview": "kind of disappointed in this - it focused so much more on the mystery rather than the romance between the main couple and was just blah...(I had the mystery figured out about 1/3 of the way through)"}, {"userName": "Dorine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6942470-dorine", "userReview": "4 Blue Ribbon Review courtesy of Romance Junkies. Full review also available at my blog, TBR Mountain Range. The Wests and the Grants have been at odds with one another since the murder of Ginny West and the suspicion that Carson Grant was the killer, eleven years ago. Will Destry Grant and Rylan West ever have another chance at love when the murder is solved? Or will the murders continue, endangering them all?Ginny West's murder has hung over the town of Beartooth, Montana like a cloud, overshadowing hopes and dreams for eleven years. Rylan West had joined the rodeo to get away from the love he knew would never be his, when his sister's murder hadn't been solved, and his girlfriend's brother was the likely suspect. Carson Grant had been sent away by his father who feared he'd be arrested for the murder. Destry Grant had lost her first love, Rylan, and her older brother, Carson, at the same time, yet she stayed in Beartooth, making a life for herself on her family's ranch.After eleven years, the young men have returned at the same time. One has tired of his wanderlust \u2012 the other has been summoned by his father. When the murder case is reopened by the sheriff due to new evidence, none of them will rest well until the case is solved. Can they trust one another enough to work together to solve the mystery surrounding Ginny West's death? Or will the strain of distrust drive a permanent wedge between them all?The multiple romantic entanglements within UNFORGIVEN suit the suspenseful plot perfectly, giving the reader time to develop suspicions and feel invested in the town's plight. There are quite a few very interesting secondary characters who kept me guessing as to who was lying and who was not. In truth, UNFORGIVEN read more like a thriller than a romantic suspense because it was edgier and more fast-paced, allowing the romance between Destry and Rylan to slowly progress. I was intrigued by the intertwining storylines that kept me from guessing \u201cwho done it\u201d. I also felt that a faster pacing of the romance between Destry and Rylan would have been unrealistic, considering the circumstances of their previous relationship, in addition to the conflict happening eleven years later. This gives the reader a chance to get to know multiple characters within the town of Beartooth and hopefully, those secondary characters will make an appearance in future books. Also, there was at least one loose end that wasn't resolved that has me very curious for the next book, REDEMPTION.I especially enjoyed the rapid-fire suspense toward the end of UNFORGIVEN. The mystery had been layered from the beginning, and although I had my suspicions of who the killer was, I was very surprised by the turn of events. The last one-third of the book was gripping, which made me race to the finish.This is the first book by B.J. Daniels that I've read, but I'm sure I'll be adding a few more. Tightly woven, author B.J. Daniels' storytelling is the perfect pace for a modern western adventure. Readers who love stories about the rugged Montana landscape will surely enjoy the start of this series and look forward to what's next."}, {"userName": "Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4391611-guilty-pleasures-book-reviews", "userReview": "Shey's review posted on Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews4 StarsI am not a big reader of Harlequin books but I am of suspense and this book caught my eye right away. I don\u2019t really know what the draw was but I think it had to do with the town being called Beartooth, Montana and set around the Crazy Mountains, but whatever it was I am glad that I read it. Also, I might add that I did read the first novella in the series FALLEN, it is very short and it does give you Ginny West\u2019s point of view.There were so many twist and turns that I had to almost keep notes as to where this book was going. You don\u2019t only have the main story of who killed Ginny West but also stories of others in the town that somehow B.J. Daniels made work into the final outcome and when you think you have finally figured out who had done it, it changes.Rylan West and Destry Grant were childhood sweethearts, when Rylans sister Ginny was killed eleven years ago and Carson Grant, Destrys brother is the number one suspect and they are torn apart. The grief and betrayal sends Rylan off to the Pro-Rodeo Circuit breaking his promise to always love Destry.Destry is devastated not only does she lose Rylan but her father sends Carson away, since there is no evidence to actually convict him of the crime he isn\u2019t charged.Eleven years later Rylan and Carson both come home of course for very different reasons. Rylan misses his family and Montana. Carson is being summoned by his father to take over the ranch and new evidence has shown up in Ginny\u2019s investigation. Everyone in Beartooth wants to see him pay for Ginny Wests murder, including Rylan. Things start to heat up when the town wants their own form of justice.Still not convinced that her brother is guilty, even though she finds out he has lied to her about that night. However, when the same thing starts happening to another women in town, Destry and Rylan both know it\u2019s more than just a coincidence and together they set out to find answers to what really happened.This time it didn\u2019t matter what the outcome is because Rylan had never stopped loving Destry and he wasn\u2019t giving up on them. She felt the same Destry was tired of trying to save everybody. For eleven years she had done her best and now she wanted the man she had always loved and she was going to have him no matter the cost.I really liked that you didn\u2019t see one person\u2019s point of view but you saw many. I felt it worked well that way. Although there was a little more description into the Montana landscape than I cared for and a storyline about Sherriff Curry and Nettie the general store owner that I wasn\u2019t sure where it was going. I hope along the way to find out, Nettie is a busy body and gossip so she\u2019s a lot of fun.Overall, there was a lot of great suspense in this book and in trying to figure out who had killed Ginny. I didn\u2019t stop reading this till the end and I tell you this I never expected it to be who it was.Review copy provided for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jane Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart", "userReview": "Weak 3 stars. Reminds me of a TV soap opera. Mostly a mystery with red herrings.It sounds like a colorful cast of characters in a small town with a lot of secrets, but nothing grabbed me. The characters reminded me of those in other books. Wealthy father wants to give ranch to no good son who would sell it and gamble away the money. Father won\u2019t give his ranch or love to his daughter Destry who is competent and loves working the ranch. The son\u2019s girlfriend Ginny was murdered. Destry and her estranged lover Rylan investigate the murder and uncover some things. A number of people lied or did not come forward with what they knew. There are several red herrings. It was ok as a mystery, but nothing special. It was easy to put down. The best I can say is I didn\u2019t skim parts or wish it would be over. It was a way to pass time.There is a romance (Destry and Rylan) but we don\u2019t see them meet or develop a relationship. That happened years ago. They broke up and Rylan left town. He just now returned eleven years later. There is no romantic development. It\u2019s more of I\u2019m sorry I was bad, I still love you, lets have sex. The one sex scene felt flat. I would have liked some interesting emotions or passion.The worst part was the way the author jumped around and interrupted scenes. Instead of logical endings to scenes, many were cut in the middle of an action or conversation. Two examples follow.A has just discovered that B is having an affair with a man who may be a murderer. A is driving to B\u2019s house to talk to B. The scene stops and jumps to another character and place for 3 \u00bd pages and then goes back to A talking to B.CAUTION SEMI SPOILER:A asks a man if he is her biological father. He says no. Her next logical question should be who might he suspect, since he was close to her mother. But the scene stopped. I was annoyed.DISCLOSURE:This book was provided to me free of charge through the Amazon Vine Program in return for my writing a review.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Story length: 336 pages.

Carson and Ginny had been an item before her gruesome death and even though no evidence pointed directly to Carson, many in the small town believed he was getting away with murder. Carson's sister Destry was his staunchest supporter. At the other end of the spectrum was Rylan West, Ginny's brother and the love of Destry's life, who believed completely that Carson was to blame for his sister's death.Not being able to live in Beartooth any longer with constant reminders of Ginny and her demise, Rylan leaves town and stays away for all this time, returning shortly before Carson, who was sent away by his influential father WT. Throughout this entire time, Destry has been holding down the fort, so to speak. She has been practically running her father's ranch , the W Bar G, even as WT dislikes the thought of Destry working the ranch. The two never saw eye to eye on that and many other matters and WT's cool indifference for his 28 year old daughter has left an ache in Destry, who often wonders what she has done wrong.At Sheriff Frank Curry's behest, Carson is back in town to answer some questions about the eleven year old cold case and arrives with a surprise fiancee, which angers his father, WT. Once word gets around that Carson is back, old animosities that were carefully hidden for the passed decade, rise once again to create turmoil in the otherwise quiet town.Separated after the murder, Rylan and Destry try to put aside their feelings for one another, as they both are still in love with the other, but that bone of contention called the murder of Ginny West, hangs overhead preventing the pair from finally being happy. Now with new evidence, Destry and Rylan attempt to sort out the facts of the murder and their relationship. Rylan still believes Carson is to blame but when said evidence says someone else is in the mix here, Rylan begins to doubt all himself and the belief that Carson is the murderer.UNFORGIVEN is B.J. Daniels at her finest. I used to read mystery ad suspense solely in the past, but virtually gave up on them when they all became so predictable. Guess what? I'm back! B.J. Daniels had my head spinning with suspects, second guessing myself constantly at who done it. In addition, Ms. Daniels has a way of giving you the inside on all the players in Beartooth and making you a part of its community. I felt right at home with her colorful cast of characters like the general store owner, Nettie, who is the town gossip. You either love Nettie or you want to smack her, which I would have liked to have done several times. We all know someone like her. Every little back story added to the whole and I cannot wait for more. I highly recommend UNFORGIVEN by B.J. Daniels.

You could see some change, others refusing to, while others made you question what they were doing at all. It didn't matter if they were minor characters or the main character, they all played important roles in the story even if it wasn't revealed until near the end. There were a few characters who roles were very small and yet I have several questions that went unanswered about them, the main one being Kate LaFord, I still want to know what she's all about. So I can only wait for the next book in the series to come out (which will be at the end of this month).Overall my favorite part was the actual suspense when it came to solving Ginny's murder after eleven years. The reason I enjoyed it so much is because the story was ever changing, clues from the past that hadn't been present during the initial investigation popped up, new suspects came into the light while some older ones were believed innocent. The twists and turns kept me wonder, guessing who did it, and just when I thought I had it all figured out something new would op up and leave me trying to figure things out once more. It was this mystery that I loved and yet frustrated me at times because I just couldn't figure it out. In the end, when it was revealed who the murderer was I definitely kicked myself for not coming to that conclusion. Granted I at one time suspected that person but shifted my attention to another based upon certain events.While some would consider this to be a romance novel I didn't think the romance aspect of it was strong enough for that classification. After all Destry and Rylan really can't be together because Ginny's murder has put a barrier between them. Yet it shows that love can endure through even the toughest of situations.My one issue was that the ending, being the epilogue after the murder was finally solved, just seemed like a quick way to tie up several loose ends and didn't really flow well like the rest of the book did. In fact I feel like there should have been a couple more chapters instead of that single small epilogue to put all the pieces together.In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed with book, it was suspenseful, touching and kept me on my toes throughout all of it. I will definitely be looking for more from this author as those few books I have read by her really were great reads."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/955320-rhonda", "userReview": "4 STARSI was kept guessing right until the end.

I have read this series out-of-order by starting with FORSAKEN, the third book in the series. I enjoyed FORSAKEN so much, that I've gone back and read the two books that preceded it.UNFORGIVEN is the story of Destry Grant and Rylan West. They were young and madly in love years ago before Rylan's sister, Ginny, was murdered with Destry's brother as the prime suspect. Rylan needed to get away after the murder so he escaped by taking up the life of the rodeo cowboy. Now he's returned to Beartooth and is living at his family's ranch next door to Destry's ranch. Destry's brother who was sent away from Beartooth to escape the scandal, has been summoned back by his ailing father to take over the ranch just as new evidence is revealed. As in all of her books, there are a plethora of secondary characters - not too many, but the inter-connectivity of all the characters assuredly enriches the tale.I love the book's setting: Beartooth, Montana at the base of the Crazy Mountains. The author's description of the area continues to amaze me as I feel that I'm right there while reading. Even now, I can close my eyes and be back there. Her detailed visuals are awesome and stick with you. The book is much more than a light, clean romantic novel. There's also plenty of mystery and suspense - more than enough to keep the reader from falling to sleep until the book is read. :-))) I'd highly recommend this series to anyone who loves a good mystery or who loves stories featuring the West or cowboys or who just loves a good story. I totally appreciate that BJ doesn't leave the reader with a cliffhanger ending.

Daniels. I am excited about her new \"Beartooth, Montana\" series from HQN, which features longer-length books than B.J.'s signature Harlequin Intrigue series. \"Unforgiven\" is the first Beartooth, Montana title, and I loved it! The contemporary Western setting, the strongly-sketched characters and how their families intertwined and were influenced by long-held traditions of land ownership, and the intriguing mystery at the core of the story line all came together for a terrific read! Young sweethearts Destry Grant and Rylan West were torn apart by a tragedy which forever changed the future of both of their families. Destry's brother Carson was accused of killing his girlfriend, Rylan's sister, Ginny. Carson leaves the area with a cloud of dark suspicion over his head, and Rylan also leaves his home behind to join the rodeo circuit and distance himself from painful memories. Destry is left behind to pick up the pieces and keep together what is left of her personal life. Almost a decade later, both Carson and Rylan return to Beartooth. New evidence surfaces in the murder case, and old dangers threaten to once again take a terrible toll. The love between Destry and Rylan never ended, but is it strong enough to finally face the true enemy? Can they overcome the deeply-felt pain of the past and build a loving and lasting future together? \"Unforgiven\" is a sweetly-sensual and suspenseful reunion romance--highly recommended for lovers of terrific romantic suspense!

When Rylan West\u2019s sister, Ginny, is found brutally murdered, he, like everyone else in Beartooth, Montana, thinks Destry Grant\u2019s brother, Carson, is responsible. The only problem is that Rylan and Destry are a couple. Ten years later, after they separated and Carson fled the state, Rylan is back in town. As is Carson. And now everyone wants to know what really happened the night of the murder. When evidence surfaces suggesting the dead woman had a secret lover and was pregnant by him, Rylan and Destry join forces to help find the killer. As they question friends and neighbors, the barriers that have kept them apart for a decade begin to tumble. Meanwhile, Carson has to ask his rancher father for money to pay his gambling debts. Who is more threatening, the riled townsfolk or the loan sharks? Fans of western romantic suspense will relish Daniels\u2019 tale of clandestine love played out in a small town on the Great Plains. \u2014 Pat Henshaw"}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1401819-dianne", "userReview": "This is a difficult to describe novel. It is part romance, part suspense and part mystery - but it is 100% pure enjoyment.I went into this novel not in the mood for reading this type of book, yet I found myself being quickly drawn into the story and unable to put the book down. This is a novel filled with complex characters, and there are a lot of them. The idea of lovers being torn apart by tragedy is a little old hat, but B.J. does a wonderful job giving it a bit of a fresh twist.There are many plot twists and enough red herrings to make even the most hard-core mystery fan weep with unbridled glee. The descriptions of the countryside left me wanting to visit. The romance (and sex) is mild, although important to the story -it isn't the main theme. The plot doesn't revolve around the 'couple', yet we do end up with our romantic HEA in the end.In other words, this is an author I am going to make a point of buying and reading whenever I get the chance. In fact, I went and bought another book in this series just this morning and can't wait to get to it!"}, {"userName": "Mari", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7345501-mari", "userReview": "Eleven years ago Ginny West was murdered and Destry Grant's older brother Carson became the main suspect.

It had so many mysteries and so many suspects, it was pure entertainment. I was going to give it 5 stars but I thought some of the things in the wrap up were hogwash. It felt like the author just snipped off a few knots rather than untangling them. The emphasis in this book is on the crime and the romance took a back seat. The scenery of this beautiful mountain area was vividly, but not boringly, described and became another character in the book. 4 and 3/4 stars."}, {"userName": "Joanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2494334-joanie", "userReview": "Carson Grant was accused of killing his girlfriend.

This was an amazing story. A cold case murder case that takes 11 years to solve. Destry's brother is accused of killing Rylan's sister. It caused a split in their relationship. Now 11 years later we meet a few more players. Suspense to the end. A very well written story. And there are a few extra surprises thrown in. Just the right length too. :) Looking forward to reading the next one.The cover is beautiful too!!!"}, {"userName": "Jo  (Mixed Book Bag)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1372248-jo-mixed-book-bag", "userReview": "This is book one in the Beartooth series and there is a mystery. I did figure out who did it by the middle of the books but there were still some surprises in the story. This also introduced some of the characters that will be in the next two books. Since I read this last I knew that they would be important even though they were just a name or a short introduction in Unforgiven. I love the tension that Daniels writes into her stories. She writes great scenes with a lot of good dialog while telling a entertaining story."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3325574-melanie", "userReview": "This was kinda disappointing. While the story itself has potential, it was seriously rushed, and not developed anywhere near close enough. It was basically a bunch of little stories that didn't really lead anywhere. The drama was seriously overdone, and flat out uncomfortable. At first, I thought that maybe I had been dropped in the middle of a series, but no, it is just written like that.
