Digital Divide is the first of Spangler\u2019s books in the series and takes care of the majority of world building necessary to understand the intricacies of her universe. Allow me to sum up:Essentially the United States Government decided to input chips in to people\u2019s heads that allowed them to interact with machines. ANY machine that uses electronic processing \u2013from cell phones to power stations to laptops \u2013 can interact with this chip. It\u2019s an amazing piece of technology and the Government wanted to use it as a sort of secret weapon. Instead the users who didn\u2019t go insane banded together and outed the effort forming OACET \u2013 the Office of Adaptive and Complementary Enhancement Technologies \u2013 without asking permission. Things go steadily interesting from there.Rachel Peng is one of these OACET agents and she seems to get stuck with all of the \u2018fun\u2019 jobs. This time she is investigating a bombing that occurred in our nation\u2019s capitol \u2013 an investigation that seems to be pointing at our own military as being responsible. Throughout the book we follow Rachel\u2019s investigation as well as her thoughts and interactions with the community. Spangler does an excellent job of conveying the different personalities and interactions that people have with their \u2018new\u2019 cyborg brethren. The novel is an interesting one and Peng is an interesting protagonist. While Digital Divide offered an interesting premise, I would argue that many of the characters involved, including Peng herself, were a bit on the flat side and, occasionally, repetitive. This has been fixed tremendously in Maker Space. Now that Spangler has established the universe, she gets to play with the characters and their morals.That play is where the majority of the novel takes place. Yes, it\u2019s a procedural story, but the characters and their interactions are at the heart of it and those interactions are fascinating. You have Peng as our filter to see the world through and the irony of her being blind is not lost on the reader. We\u2019re only seeing what she can see, and what she can see is, in many ways, more intimate than what a sighted person can \u2013 even though many organizations would not see it that way. We also meet a number of her colleagues in the police department (she\u2019s a liason between OACET and the DC police) and Spangler does a good job of differentiating the different officers and agents that Peng interacts with. Of special interest is Peng\u2019s partner in the police. He is one of the few people that Rachel has trusted with her secret of being blind and also one of the few that she listens to an has direct admiration for. He\u2019s also a maker, a term I haven\u2019t heard before but appears to be based on actual spaces spread around the country. That Spangler has found this community and woven it in to the story. It is done with a great deal of respect, but not fawing \u2013 a delicate balance for a creator to reach and make feel authentic. Spangler\u2019s authenticity comes through quite well. It helps to have a charming person like Santino to experience the community with and through. There are also a number of \u2018extras\u2019 that pop in and out throughout the investigation. It\u2019s the usual group of suspects, informants, and plot developers and each is interesting in their own ways. They don\u2019t get the full on development that Santino and Peng get, but they each have their motives and personalities. They aren\u2019t supposed to be as well developed as Santino and Peng, but they can be just as entertaining and interesting as the pair.(A few of the \u2018cameos\u2019 from her webcomic are slighted slightly in development, but that makes sense \u2013 they are supposed to be cameos and their development is left to Spangler\u2019s webcomic.)On the whole, this is an excellent book and is a fascinating read for fans of \u2018A Girl and Her Fed\u2019 and an even more exciting read for those that are not. It stands excellently on its own and is a great investigation novel. I enjoyed it tremendously and look forward to the next installment.

She's smart, sassy, and fun without sacrificing character growth and distinction. This is the second book in the series and it just leaves me salivating for more. Spangler is one of those authors who I dearly wish I could pay to write a book every three months and do nothing else.Maker Space is really different from Digital Divide. And I think that difference really helped the book rather than hindered it. Rachel, the main character, isn't suited to the murder-a-week (or book) scenario. She's smart and jumping through the same hoops over and over again would do her no favors. She wouldn't grow as a character in that setting and we - as readers - need her to, as much as the character needs to grow in order to move the books forward.I love Rachel, both as a character, but also as solid representation. Rachel is Chinese-American, a cyborg, blind, and a lesbian. And, delightfully, Rachel is so blessedly normal. Yeah, she's all kinds of different. But she's carved out a niche for herself where she goes to her job, comes home to a roommate who won't give up that one annoying habit, and *that* neighbor. She worries about house values and dating problems. People forget she's a cyborg because she's so normal. And no one says shit about her being a lesbian. It's so beautiful and wonderful and I could read Rachel all day.It's really good to see a totally different kind of political intrigue. The shadowy, behind-the-scenes sort of things that happened in Digital Divide are something of a reality. But events that play out very publicly, like a bombing wherein the media makes sure everything is done under the heavy scrutiny of the public eye, are also reality. Government can't keep everything under wraps and watching Rachel navigate the public and private sectors in Maker Space was a dynamic I am glad was introduced. She kind of got off scott-free in Digital Divide, in that respect. That couldn't last forever. I do so love the differences between these two books.I love seeing a little more of Rachel's personal life (her struggles with blindness, anxiety, how to date, her roommate), but also seeing the changes in her professional life. It was a relief that the most beloved characters from the last book were back in full force in Maker Space, as well as a little more chance to get to know them, personally, as well. I do so love characters who are real and present, but don't get in the way of the story.I love this book, just as much if not more than the last.A+ (standard of excellence in writing maintained, beautiful characters)"}, {"userName": "Mona", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5975349-mona", "userReview": "Rachel Peng is a Chinese-American Federal Agent thrown into an investigation into a terrorist bombing. So far, so realistic -- and it is; this a reality just a jump to the left. But Rachel is not only a vet and a lesbian but a cyborg too: the product of an experiment run by the US government that went off the rails before it jumped back on. Here she is with that chip in her head that connects her inseparably to information technology systems and her little department of cyborgs (aka OACET, Office of Adaptive and Complementary Enhancement Technologies). All of her fellow OACET Agents are able to use the chip to lock into electronic systems and extract-slash-manipulate the flow of impulses, but they also spark other changes in the human body and mind. Rachel has honed one particular aspect of perception to perfection: feeling her way around another person's emotional landscape in synesthetic ways. All of this makes the novel rather technical and -- literally -- colorful, more so than I usually enjoy, but it has a point beyond geeky glee: Rachel has lost, in an event she herself doesn't understand, most of her eyesight, and her vision of the world is based mostly on the grid of electronics on the one hand and the beacons of human emotions on the other. That part is a secret to most; the cyborg part isn't, and the backlash Rachel has encountered in the wake of the cyborgs project going public has made her wary.Especially after reading Santa Olivia, I feel this another great take on the female superhero genre: One, Rachel's story is filtered through an oddly shaped lens of ability and disability: She has lost most of one sense, but of course the experiments on her have given her another, multifaceted one. Two, she is careful, controlled -- yes, she has genuine powers through her ability to manipulate the electronic world, but in a hand-to-hand combat or any other physical situation that one's useless. Her chip is no sonic screwdriver, that's for sure. If this sounds complex, wait until you hear about the political thriller aspects -- that's the overarching plot, pretty much. Rachel does do some dating too, and that's cute but low-key. Needless to say she's snarky too, as are some of her colleagues. Basically, you like contemporary earth sci-fi and speculative fiction on various levels, societal, political, and technological?

And they are! Rachel Peng is not a major character in the webcomic, so it was nice get to meet new characters, though my true loyalty will always lie with Hope and Speedy. Yeah, Speedy, not Sparky.

I know authors don't usually read reviews, but if you happen by, thank you so much for letting me do that!) I think my next dream book is a team-up between Rachel and Hope, because the ensuing chaos would be amazing.Oh, right, what are the books about? Very briefly, these books are set in the fall-out of a secret government-funded program which created cyborgs for use in spying and infiltration missions. \"Not the clankity-clank pneumatic gun-arm variety of cyborg, but the type that was otherwise completely human except for the tiny chip in their brain which allowed them to take control of any networked machine. (If she had been given the option, Rachel probably would have chosen the gun arm, or the rocket legs, or any other heavy artillery to augment her own natural stopping power instead of the implant. But those were the stuff of science fiction; she had no idea how a piece of technology as complex as her implant could have been invented before the scientists perfected flamethrower fingers. Different priorities, she supposed. Still. Flamethrower fingers.)\" Maker Space is a post-terrorist attack detective/procedural with a loving look at the maker movement of artists and creators."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6919482-erin", "userReview": "Like its predecessor, \"Digital Divide\", \"Maker Space\" is a tight, thought-provoking thriller with a strong female protagonist and a diverse cast. What makes the Rachel Peng novels truly exceptional reads is Spangler's ability to create a truly immersive world. She blends existing technology with the plausible seamlessly; Spangler clearly does impressive research for these stories. Most powerful is her use of Peng's unique senses; Peng can \"see\" emotional patterns due to her cybernetic implant. Since Peng is still learning to attach what she perceives to nuanced emotions, the reader is invited to learn along with her. This makes it much easier for the reader to accept the new technology, and to become immersed in the world Spangler has constructed. It allows great emotional depth, especially as compared to many others examples of the genre. Since this depth is introduced through Peng's novel perceptual abilities, the descriptions of the emotional map of the narrative strengthen the immersion,and Spangler is able to avoid heavy or cliched language that can bog down a narrative and interfere with the pace of the story.I would highly recommend these books to anyone, especially those who like near-future thrillers, law-enforcement dramas, or cyberpunk."}, {"userName": "Jean Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6207899-jean-johnson", "userReview": "MAKER SPACE is Spangler's 3rd book about cyborgs and more. It is more serious than the previous Rachel Peng novel, DIGITAL DIVIDE (and naturally more serious than the Josh Glassman novel, THE RUSSIANS CAME KNOCKING, but then, that's Josh for you). It still has humor, wit, and humanity laced throughout the story, but this is a much more serious tale.How serious? Seven bombs destroy fourteen blocks of Washington D.C. tourist retail space. Dozens dead, buildings destroyed, the threat of rioting in the streets...all because no one can figure out who did this and why, leaving nothing but wild speculation and outrage to boil over on the city streets. Rachel, her cop partner Santino, her fellow agent Phil, and more are caught up in the chaos, uncertainty, and need to succeed in figuring out what happened. This time, the stability of an entire city--the nation's capital--is at stake, not just lives.I can't say more without giving away spoilers, but I can say this is a book (for the moment, an ebook only) that will suck you in and have you huddled over your e-reader, reading until the very last page....Also, the door into the maker space loft sounds like an awesome piece of architecture."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/309661-john", "userReview": "Not quite as stellar as the first Rachel Peng outing: the plot isn't as focused and keeps wandering off into side scenes and psychological crises; the banter has a few moments but is weaker sauce; there is too much explanation of the back story (one thing I loved about DIGITAL DIVIDE was the way OACET's creation and culture was slipped into the action--here it's all infodumps); all the Maker Space business seemed forced in to trumpet the movement rather than advance the story.
