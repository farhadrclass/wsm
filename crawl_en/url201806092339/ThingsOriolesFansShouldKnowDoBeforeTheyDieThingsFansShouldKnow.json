While I was familiar with many of the stories, figures, stats and games, Connolly held my interest with other stories that were new to me. In my opinion, his 100 things are comprehensive - I didn't feel like he had left anything out. The funny part is that I had two encounters with Orioles trainer Ralph Salvon. One was at the first game I ever went to in 1969, when he handed me a baseball. Then, 14 years later, I saw him on the street and told him that story. I was a little surprised that he was not mentioned in the book until I got to the very last page. A must for hardcore and casual Orioles' fans."}, {"userName": "Tim Pafundi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36234394-tim-pafundi", "userReview": "Anyone who knows me knows that I am a dyed-in-the-wool Orioles fan, from the mid-70's to now. I thought I knew a lot about my favorite team, however, after reading this book, there's so much more to this team than I was even aware of! I truly enjoyed reading stories about my favorite players and other interesting facts. This is a MUST read for any Orioles fan!"}, {"userName": "Derek Arnold", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32927228-derek-arnold", "userReview": "A must-read for O's fans!"}], "description": "This guide to all things Baltimore Oriole covers the team's history as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, including the incredible legacy of Cal Ripken Jr., memories from Memorial Stadium, and how singing \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\" during the seventh-inning stretch has become a fan-favorite tradition.
