Telander masterfully unfolds how the culture of basketball functions on and around the courts of Brooklyn during the early 1970s. We meet kids who dream of getting out of the inner-city via basketball scholarships. We meet kids who have left to play in college and simply can't function and so they return. We learn about one of the biggest stars of the street ball scene (Fly Williams) and how self-destructive his impulses can be. One of the more fascinating story lines is that of a 14-year-old prodigy (Albert King, Bernard King's younger brother) and how he tries to navigate his fame. He is courted to leave the city and play in Pennsylvania at a prep school. He and his family will be compensated by local businessmen associated with the school but he struggles with leaving the only neighborhood he has ever known. Connecting all the stories is Rodney Parker, the man that works tirelessly as a talent evaluator and scout of the inner-city. He is the connection between coaches at every level of college basketball and the poverty-stricken prospects that run the courts everyday at Foster Park. Parker is so fascinating because, while he could be \"delivering\" players to programs for cash, he seems to do what he does for the mere status it brings him amongst the young players. Telander deftly inserts many of the character's own comments about poverty, violence and education. This is an excellent read and I highly recommend, even for those aren't basketball fans."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "I was rather reluctant to read this book. Let's just say that sports and I aren't exactly the best of friends, not since the forced gym classes of my junior high school days. I know nothing at all about basketball aside from the horror of them being used as potential weapons by bullying kids. But Heaven is a Playground isn't just about sports. It's about history, it's about the kids who grew up in that history, it's about Seventies nostalgia, and it's about fun."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26716325-matt", "userReview": "An Eye-Opening inside Look: Heaven is a Playground5 out of 5 stars\tImagine yourself in a basketball game, or whatever sport you love; that rush of adrenaline, the excitement of competition and the amazing feeling you get when you make a good play. Although it may be hard to believe, those who play basketball in the inner-city feel the same way. Heaven is a Playground gives a never-before-seen inside look at the purity of basketball, even in one of the most beleaguered places on Earth. This book captures not only the spirit of the game, but also vividly recreates the mid-70s and BrooklynWhen he wrote the book in 1974, Rick Telander was in his 20s when he went to Brooklyn to spend a summer, in part because he was in search of the elusive playground legend James \"Fly\" Williams, who figures prominently in the book. During the course of the three months he stayed there, he met, played with, interviewed and befriended a host of regulars at the courts in Foster Park in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. At the park, African-American boys and men played basketball for something far more special than just recreation. On the surface, some seemed to play as a cop-out of daily life, or in Rodney Parker\u2019s case, a way to make money ticket-scalping. Telander states, \u201cWho, I asked, was Rodney Parker? Basically he was a thirty-six-year-old black, self-educated ticket scalper-street hustler who spent most of his time scouting young playground stars,\u201d (Telander 3). However, for Rodney, along with many of the \u201cstreet-ballers\u201d, the game found a spot in their hearts as a way of life, and even more importantly a form of self-expression. Besides Williams and Parker, Telander also met Albert King, then an astonishingly gifted 14-year-old, with promise to go on to the NBA. King, with his exceptional talents, succeeded in his task to make it to the NBA, and he went on to have a successful career. On one hand, Telander brings to life the court skills of King and others, but he also humanizes them, and this humanization earns most of the commendation of the book. One example of the side effects of talent showed when Albert King agonized over his talent, which brought him attention and exaltation that embarrassed him and sometimes made him angry and withdrawn. Also, Williams' incredible pure talent remained married to an unpredictable and sometimes violent temperament that ultimately shortened his career. These examples alone show the harms to having unbelievable talent paired with psychological problems.Despite an obvious empathy for his subjects (he wound up coaching a group of teenage park regulars, with mixed on-the-court success) Telander does not romanticize them. Flatbush, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville, where the action of the book primarily takes place, were seen by the world as some of the worst neighborhoods in the world. Many of the people Telander spent extensive time with were scarred by their environment, and he positions the environment they lived in directly in front. Though the book avoids a sense of \"white guilt,\" Telander does agonize at one point over a boy he left off his team who succumbed to drug use and was later killed. I hope to see a sequel to Heaven is a Playground, a sort of \u201cWhere are they now?\u201d update on the scene. Even if Telander failed to find any of the former characters, I would love to see how the blacktop basketball atmosphere has changed over the thirty years this book has been released for. The world has changed dramatically since then, and I assume the described scene has also evolved. At times funny, often poignant, and filled with a love for its subject, \"Heaven Is a Playground\" remains an engrossing, and still timely, read nearly 30 years after its publication."}, {"userName": "Jose", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18471912-jose", "userReview": "Afros, tubesocks, Pro Keds, finger rolls, stuff shots, the ABA, and Kool and the Gang are all the rage among the basketball youths of the inner-city in Heaven is a Playground. Set in Brooklyn during the summer of 1974, Rick Telander spends a tumultuous off-season logging the stories of the project playgrounds. In particular, the book revolves around self-styled basketball agent Rodney Parker, troubled superstar \"Fly\" Williams, middle-school phenom Albert King, and the various Foster Park youths, all of whom share the same hoopz-driven ghetto universe. Rodney in particular remains a a fascinating enigma all throughout, and serves roughly as the focal point from which all the other threads run through. A ticket scalper by trade, he earns substantial notoriety in the college basketball realm, finding would-be diamonds in the rough and offering (often pushing) them to various programs across the country. Meanwhile, in the world of Foster Park (and Brooklyn, in a sense) he holds a certain amount of respect as a man who can give desperate basketball hopefuls a chance (oftentimes a last chance) at college education and possibly a path towards playing professionally. For his part, Rodney is a shameless self-promoter, nakedly basking in the status he's built for himself, forever bragging of the good he's done for various players, lording over the teens he openly taunts as not good enough to make an effort to help, and ingratiating himself to any talented player he feels could make it.Enter Fly, Rodney's most popular (and potentially lucrative) find. Fly posses a world of talent, is beloved in the Brownsville projects from which he hails, but is notoriously unstable to the point that he is blacklisted by all but the most desperate college programs and professional teams. Fly's antics and self-destructive behavior cost him opportunity after opportunity at lucrative contracts and a bigger spotlight, seemingly content with being a big fish in a small basketball pond.Indeed, the little fish at Foster Park idolize Fly. He represents a defiant and flashy hero who grew up in their backyard. His name is written in graffiti all throughout his stomping grounds. Kids practice his moves and emulate his knack for chaos. All except for serious-minded and heavily-hyped Albert King, the impossibly-talented 6'5\" 14 year-old, whom Rodney Parker openly covets and recruits.The youths at Foster Park alternate from endearing to inspiring to tragic. If you've seen season 4 of The Wire, then you're already familiar with some of these characters, as some seem to be direct inspirations, and have similar uplifting and heartbreaking stories.HIAP is uneven in that the narrative jumps around, giving a scattered impression here and there without letting momentum develop in any direction. This is much less of a problem in the second half, when Telander gets better at controlling the pace of each part so that they all parallel and overlap in rewarding ways as a whole, especially towards the end (the Subway Stars arc is particularly wonderful). I could also do without the thankfully rare moments where he slips out of reporter mode and into his personal thoughts, telling instead of showing. This is particularly a problem in the introduction; I recommend skipping it and going straight to chapter one. But more to the point, I urge you to read this book at all if you fancy yourself a hoopz geek."}, {"userName": "Peter Nolan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25642544-peter-nolan", "userReview": "Rick Telander, a writer for Sports Illustrated, hoped to spend a few days in New York in order to write a piece on inner-city basketball. He stayed a whole summer. He became so drawn to the people and the ideals, he kept wanting more. Observant and intrigued, his motives for staying bleed through the ink, and as a result enhance the substance and value in the book.\tTelander implores a very unique style. While he remains just a fly on the wall just calling things as he hears them, his words elusively sink much deeper than that. Seemingly every sentence has meaning, and the inviting part about this idea is that they mean something different to each reader, depending on how they relate to the subject. His observations do a terrific job of examining the inner-city culture, and what basketball means to these athletes \u2013 both short and long term. The close relationship and pivotal role promoter Rodney Parker plays in the novel really helps drive the story, and adds an element unique to the area. His connections give these kids a goal. It gives them determination, and adds a physical representation for what these kids are trying to accomplish through basketball: breaking out of the slums and making something of themselves. It gives the reader something to root for too, and the path each story takes continually gives them a different aspect to look at.\tHeaven is a Playground is a quick and nice read. The style is fluid and the topic fun, as well as intriguing. I enjoyed reading this cover to cover and would recommend it to all, sports fan or not.

Players come and go, but the playground remains, and in many ways that is the gift of this book. The victory of those high priests rewarded for their devotion with college places and accolades, and the tragedy of those who succumb to limited options, to the ghetto, to lack of skill, who never get a chance to blow, are really all parts of the same tapestry and the game doesn't stop for them or anyone. The court sees them all, counts their sins and moves along. The acknowledgment of the difficulties faced even by the 'victors' and by those who 'blow it', the recognition of compounding disadvantage and something akin to survivors guilt, to the entrapment of one who \"falls asleep and wakes up to nothing\" (65) - essentially how the tentacles of disadvantage drag you backwards - is a point of difference in this story, especially considering the overwhelming focus of contemporary writing on the (seemingly nihilistic) intersections between poverty, ghettoes and crime. I did think the introduction could be updated to include sociological studies of black dominance in basketball, and also to account for changes to city courts since the time of writing. Overall though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the visceral descriptions of life on the courts; suddenly I could hear the rolling thunder and smell the summer rain sizzling on the asphalt as lithe bodies flee for shelter where none is to be had and God watches impassively."}, {"userName": "Chris J", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5850120-chris-j", "userReview": "While reading about the upcoming Kansas vs. Austin Peay game in the first round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament I was reminded of a book I read long ago about a New York City playground legend named James \"Fly\" Williams who later played two seasons of college basketball at Austin Peay in the 1970s.

For example, if a ghetto playground in Brooklyn is heaven for a basketball aficionado, how much of the playground is heaven and how much is hell for the black youth who seem trapped by its relative safety?Outside of the playground? Broken glass. Graffiti. Heroine addicts. Deadly street gangs and drug dealers. Profiling cops. A society that serves ghetto youth distain and smells only the oder of failure.Although the study is of the ghetto in 1974, it is still the world of Rodney King and Trayvon Martin. It is 150 years since Emancipation and still the black man is hunted on the streets of America. The reason why Black Lives Matter. The reason why incarceration rates of blacks are a disgrace.Why basketball? What is it about this sport that yields so many outstanding athletes among black youth. Or football? Why do participation rates of blacks in pro baseball continue to drop?I think the case of baseball has something to do with the participation of youth in parts of the world even more desperate than America\u2019s ghettos. The barrio. The Caribbean wasteland. The favela.Basketball and more particularly football are far more violent sports. The success of underprivileged youth in these sports, in fact the financial success of these sports is predicated upon the failure of youth to enter the mainstream. Pro sports is an indication of just how little America has progressed since Emancipation.Where are the parents of these kids scrabbling hard to escape the ghetto? Where are the mentors? Where are the teachers? A place as big and sprawling and busy as New York has little time for the \u201closers\u201d as Donald Trump would call them.Even while author Rick Telander acknowledges seriousness of the ghetto trap for these youth, the tale is overlaid with some sentimental gauze that the home of basketball is really on these playgrounds. If he is right, then basketball is a mirror of the desperation of blacks to ever achieve equality when the deck is clearly stacked against them.On a basketball court a boy is challenged by his peers. While not as deadly as a street brawl, it is someplace the boy can test his skill, his imagination, and his manliness. And it is a brutal competition nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Tommy meeker", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58986839-tommy-meeker", "userReview": "(Plot) A guy name Rick Telander spends his whole summer in a ghetto styled community.

What I didn't like about the book was the inevitable messiah complex of a 20 year old white 'coach'. I can't imagine sitting through that many games at that age without playing. The epilogue follows up mainly with Fly Williams and Albert King, and proclaims the Brooklyn Nets as the crown jewel and manifestation of Brooklyn basketball culture. It would have been better to hear about how less talented players turned out. And - a few years into it, there is a possibility that that the Nets are indeed faking the funk.

Rick wanted to write a book about inner city basketball and life in these conditions. Not only did he get the information he wanted for his book, but he also made many friends and relationships with the black adults and youths of the Flatbush, he even created and coached a basketball team, named the Subway Stars. One of the first people Rick met in Brooklyn was a man named Rodney Parker. Rodney was one of the main characters in this book. He was a very selfless man, caring man. Rodney made his money by ticket scalping. \u201cWho, I asked, was Rodney Parker? Basically he was a thirty-six-year-old black, self-educated ticket scalper-street hustler who spent most of his time scouting young playground stars\u201d (Telander 3). That quote explains Rodney very briefly. Whenever he had time, he was down at Foster Park, scouting young basketball players playing on the courts there. Foster Park is also where Rick spent much of his time. \tRodney was known for guiding and helping basketball youths to prep schools and colleges, and even pro ball. Rodney would pick these mostly poor and starving kids up off the courts, feed them, give them money, clothes, and do many other things for them. For the talented players, he would call up dozens of schools to help them get scholarships. Many people thought that Rodney was just trying to get them into pro ball so he could receive money from them when they got there, but really, Rodney just loved kids and wanted to help them escape the poverty, drugs, and crime filled ghetto, and live a happy life. Some of the kids Rodney helped, who were also some of the main characters in the book, were Calvin Franks, Lloyd Hill, \u201cFly\u201d Williams, Albert King, Danny Odums, Lionel Worrell, Derrick Melvin, Mario Donawa, Carlos Blackwood, as well as others. The other main characters in the book were the youths hanging around Foster Park at the time Rick was there. Those kids are Ernie, Sgt. Rock, Pontiac Carr, Martin, Mark, Doodie, Vance, DeMont, and others. The plot in Heaven Is a Playground developed very quickly. There were many things going on at once.

Still, some of he buildings are well-kept, evoking by their hard-earned stateliness a bygone era of respectability\u201d (Telander 159). That quote is one of many examples of Telander\u2019s detailed yet simple style. This book definitely moved me, and it taught me a very valuable lesson. It taught me to not take my life for granted, because even though it might seem not very good at times, the kids in this book and that live in these areas have it far worse than I do. I have a warm house, food, and people who care for me, three things that many of these kids didn\u2019t have back then, and some still don\u2019t today.

This is a nonfiction book, as Rick Telander gathered this information by spending four months on the dangerous streets of Harlem while doing an article on the lives of several young aspiring basketball players. One of these players in particular is very special. His name is Albert King and he\u2019s the main character in this book. Albert is a fifteen year old basketball phenom, with immense talent that is rare to find in a player his age. Albert meets a man named Rodney White. Rodney is a basketball scout with a lengthy reputation for getting players into college. Albert realizes that Rodney is no ordinary scout. After working with Rodney on the court a few days doing skill development drills, he realizes that Rodney seems to care more about his progression as a basketball player and in life than most others scouts who just want to gain for themselves and take advantage of his ability. Rodney soon becomes somewhat of a mentor to Albert.Rodney helps Albert steer through the troubles of one of New York\u2019s toughest ghettos, often providing him with money for food and transportation. Rodney makes it clear to Albert that he hopes to get him out of the ghetto and on the right track. Through Rodney\u2019s lengthy basketball connections, he\u2019s able to land Albert a scholarship to one of the most prestigious prep schools in the country. From there, Albert\u2019s stellar performance on the basketball court and in the classroom earns him a variety of scholarships to several major division one colleges. Albert decides to attend the University of Texas. After one season of extraordinary play at Texas, Albert makes it to the NBA. Heaven Is A Playground reminds me of another basketball story that I\u2019ve read in the past called Hook. These two books are similar because they both revolve around the lives of young aspiring basketball stars that hope to use their skills to get out of the ghetto.The major difference between these two stories is that Albert is able to accomplish his goals and reach success in his basketball journey by avoiding negativity and staying on the right track. Hook, on the other hand, falls victim to the threats of his environment and is lured into negativity. Hooks develops a serious drug addiction and is later incarcerated, failing in his journey.Heaven Is A Playground shows what can be accomplished by young skilled athletes in the ghetto if they can stay postitive and most importantly work hard in the classroom and on the court. There are many players like Albert in ghettos all around the country. If these young aspiring athletes can stay focused and work hard, they too can reach success similar to Albert\u2019s. This book presents a perfect example of the possibilities of basketball in young athlete\u2019s lives, if they can stay focused, stay positive and work hard. This is a great book and I\u2019d recommend it to aspiring athletes."}, {"userName": "Jake Graziano", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25657566-jake-graziano", "userReview": "Jake GrazianoMs. PryleEnglish II H7 March 20145 out of 5From Worst to FirstIn May of 1974, Rick Telander, a sports journalist, traveled to the heart of Brooklyn, New York, for a whole summer.

Flatbush, New York, concrete jungle, hot hot summer, city playgrounds, deteriorating basketball courts, drinking cold beer in the shade, radios, endless noise, endless heat. Telander puts us there with him, among these players, both basketball and otherwise.They are all, more or less, for better or worse, basketball prodigies. They live basketball because for most, that's their only chance to get out of the ghetto. Which sounds crazy to write but it was (and is?) true. And in Foster's Park, if you wanted out, you had to have Rodney Parker on your shoulder.With all its sad figures, Parker, for me, is at the top of the list in Telander's melodrama. Parker had declared himself a kind of 'ghetto scout', proclaiming who was deemed worthy of his attention and time, and then doing his darndest to get that player into college or better yet, the NBA or ABA. When he wasn't scalping tickets, he was at Foster Park, mentoring his proteges or lecturing kids about what it meant to be a man. And what was in it for Rodney? Apparently nothing. As Telander comes to believe, Parker did it for the love of the game...and as the reader comes to realize, also for the thrill of the deal, and the love of power (however small), and the love of admiration (however imagined) and, as it turns out, for friendship. As characters, Parker, along with Fly Williams, carry the narrative. I found them to be the most interesting and pyschologically perplexing. Telander does an excellent job of bringing their emotional idiosyncracies to the surface, helping us see behind the mask of braggadocio. Williams ultimately \"betrays\" Rodney, though you get the sense that Williams couldn't really help himself...he was too damaged, his life destined to self-destruct. And also, I want to add, there is a purity within these pages. Basketball, though an escape route for some, is played mostly for the love of the game. Simply because there is nothing like a game of three on three, four on four, playing to win, yes, but also playing just to play."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15655461-dave", "userReview": "A bit dated ...

They quarrel and trade heads for bases and arms for basketballs, and when the asphalt is picked clean they dance around in triumph.\""}, {"userName": "Yusuf Proctor", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37069421-yusuf-proctor", "userReview": "Okay, so heaven is a playground is a book that is viewed from a photographers stand point, That photographers name is Rick Telander. This book is in the 1973 and 1974 summer. He discovered a playground kids who all are good basketball players but it was one who was a playground legend by the name of Fly Williams. Rick is a dedicated photographer he even slept on basketball courts and spent the night at courts in Brooklyn. He even eventually coaching a basketball team of playground players. I liked a lot of parts in this book but my favorite part was when Rick Lander was describing when Fly Williams was playing. Another part i liked who was the other characters who were in the book and they all were unique in different ways. In addition to that i liked the setting because it mostly in flatbush park all and it was a lot of people out there all the time. The story is so much about basketball that it kind of throws it off track. It kind of throws the story off track because there is no plot. but in all this is still a good book. I would recommend anybody who likes basketball to read this book. It is a action packed book full of excitement. this book is truly on of the best books that i have read. But it has a few minor flaws and still is a great book."}, {"userName": "Bill Talley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10048551-bill-talley", "userReview": "This is a great book about life that also happens to be about basketball. Like \"The Basketball Diaries\", the backdrop of this book is about real people who have some real problems. In my opinion the book shows how little it really takes to give people in some really depressed situations hope about themselves and their future. It also shows how little it takes to derail any hopes that some people have. It is obvious from this book that several of the characters have what it takes to really improve their life situation, go to college, get a job, etc., but there seem to be so few people able to simply keep them headed in the right direction when that could have made all difference, and therein lies the heart and tragedy of this book. Telander, a stranger to the young men in this book is able to enter their lives in a meaningful way simply because he cares. How tantalizingly close some of them were to making something of their lives."}, {"userName": "Jemille Edwards", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40707535-jemille-edwards", "userReview": "Jemille Edwards05/21/2015Heaven is a playground was a great book I recommend it to everyone because it is very inspiring and motivative. It basically talks about how Rodney a great basketball coach that helps players get scholarships and get into college that are from the streets. But he did way more than that with his team he took them to travel to play other basketball teams, which made them so better. Also they Rodney trained the whole team to be the best. Every player had different skills but Lloyd was one of there best players. Anyway I basically am saying this is a book that you should read. It's very interesting and you won't really want to stop reading because of how it teaches you about different teams that okay in different cities, and how Rodney made his team confident and able to do what be expected."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/282671-adam", "userReview": "This book is cool, if only to know what it's like for the guys who DON'T make it to the NBA. This book tells the story of one guy named Fly Williams who had all the talent to go to the pros, but got caught up in a bunch of shit and instead became just another dude who coulda/shoulda been. The best part is, it was written by this guy who went down to write a 2 or 3 page piece on a Bed-Stuy court in the '70s, and ended up staying, playing, and eventually coaching some of the guys he met. Very cool for a ton of reasons, and worth a read for anyone who likes basketball, in particular the streetball aspect of it."}, {"userName": "Mrlunch", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166302-mrlunch", "userReview": "Nice non-fiction documentary capturing a time in New York history where the city was almost bankrupt, crime was out of control, and heroin use was growing. Telander takes us deep into the Brooklyn ghetto and introduces us to a dozen young African-American men whose only hope of getting ahead is by playing ball. A bit of a \"slow-burner,\" this book starts off feeling a little rambling and dated, but by its half-way point, Telander weaves together the lives, dreams, and special moments he found on the courts of the Brooklyn in the summer of '74 and creates a nice snapshot of what street ball in the projects was all about at that time."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/821620-lauren", "userReview": "Originally when this book was recommended I was concerned that the sports theme would cause this book to be boring, but that wasn't the case at all. Although Telander does use technical as well as slang basketball terms throughout, this book is much more about life than basketball, or more specifically how basketball can greatly influence life. The real-life characters in Telander's account of life in Brooklyn during the summer of 1974 are not at all perfect, but they are endearing and it becomes very obvious that despite Telander's efforts to remain an objective reporter he begins to care for them very deeply. This book surprised me and I really enjoyed its sweet sadness."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom", "userReview": "This book leaves the reader with some melancholy. Some of the young players the author encounters go on to great success like Bernard King but also other players who have slipped into the perils of poverty and crime. The book presents some interesting adult characters too, such as a promoter who helps talk up players to prep schools and colleges. For another look at street basketball, this current article is pretty good too, covering its international presence."}, {"userName": "Kobe Mandell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8572601-kobe-mandell", "userReview": "I'm reading Heaven is a Playground by Rick Telander. It is a really good book. It explains how people live in bad neighborhoods. This one takes place in New York, at Foster Park. Foster Park is a place where people play basketball all day long. One day they can hope that they can escape their neighborhood and make it far in basketball. This book explains the lifestyle and how hard theses people have to work to get to the top.

Being a fan of basketball, streetball, and New York City life this book should have made it to the top of my priority list sooner, but the wait was well worth it. Telander recounts a summer well spent amongst the hoopers and dreamers of inner city New York and the account is eye-opening and informative. His lessons on life, and basketball, are a joy to read."}, {"userName": "Matt Moran", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278760-matt-moran", "userReview": "SI's top 100 seems to overrate their own writers.This is a good piece of journalism documenting the basketball scene in a specific section of Brooklyn, one summer in 1971. Telander is a good writer and a he has a distinct voice as he describes the scene.It isn't a book that made me love basketball or think \"heaven is a playground.\" For the author, it seems like he was young, he loved the game, and he he didn't have to stay.

He lets the kids speak for themselves, revealing their grand dreams and ambitions, but he never flinches from showing us how far their dreams are from reality.
