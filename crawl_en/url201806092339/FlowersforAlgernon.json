When it comes to science fiction, I would hesitate before declaring myself a fan, simply because there's only a certain amount of aliens, spaceships and intergalactic battles I can take before I start to become distracted. A good action scene on a distant planet only takes my enjoyment so far and the books I have enjoyed most from this genre tend to be the softer, more humanity-focused stories. I'm a huge fan of science fiction that doesn't seem too far away, something that I could imagine lingering just around the corner after a few more scientific experiments - and that's how I feel about Flowers for Algernon, I can imagine it as a possibility and that makes it all the more meaningful for me.This story is about Charlie Gordon who with an IQ of 68 can only hope to sweep the floors at the bakery... well, that is until he is invited to participate in an experiment previously only tested on animals. The experiment is an operation that will gradually make him a genius and allow him to become the person he's always longed to be. But, as with Adam and Eve in the genesis story we all know, intelligence comes with a price. Charlie learns that the people he's known for years are not what he'd always thought, where he once associated laughter with friendship, he soon learns that it is mockery. Stephen Fry once said that intelligence is almost entirely about the strength of your memory - and Charlie Gordon finds that out the hard way. Memories that had been forgotten come flooding back, bringing pain with them.Flowers for Algernon looks at so many different things: mental disabilities, human nature, intelligence and love. It made me feel sad, angry, frustrated and hopeful, it made me shake my head at people's behaviour and it made me incredibly thankful for so many things - I know how cliche that sounds but it's true. Even though Charlie's intelligence grows to beyond that of a normal human, he is emotionally still very much a child and has to learn the things other people learned long ago. He doesn't understand what is happening when his body becomes sexually responsive to a woman and he often doesn't understand why people say one thing but mean something completely different. The abuse he has endured because of his disabilities runs back through the years to his first public school and even his own mother. This is a very sad story that made me think about so many things and the ending just about broke my heart."}, {"userName": "Pouting Always", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-pouting-always", "userReview": "Wow I'm so glad I finally read it. I had only read passages of it before but it was totally with sitting and reading the whole thing through. I don't even know what to say I can't stop crying because of how things are for Charlie and I guess I just wish that they way he was treated wasnt so close to reality. Also it's kind of painful to have to question things like intimacy vs intelligence and self actualization which are brought up so poignantly in the book. I don't even know if anything I'm saying is making any sense but the book really got to me and now I need to be alone to cry and consolidate myself with it and the new ideas it has made me consider."}, {"userName": "Wil Wheaton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2040005-wil-wheaton", "userReview": "Heartbreaking and beautiful.

I remembered enjoying it, being fascinated in how the author painted the picture that I really was reading Charlie's journal by use of spelling, grammar and punctuation related to the level Charlie was at when writing the entries. What I didn't know at the time was the people who created the text book I used felt it was okay to chop whole chapters out of the middle of the book. They felt pulling out whole sections was okay in the name of protecting children from \"bad\" concepts like sex, alcohol, and violence. They didn't consider that perhaps leaving the story intact and waiting for the children to mature before handing them this story was a better route.I discovered this injustice when I was in a used bookstore, and remembered this story I read in class I enjoyed, so I dug up a copy and bought it. When I got home, I jumped right in and started to reread it, only to get a shock in the middle of the book where suddenly there were whole chapters about this neighbor Charlie gets involved with that I didn't remember. When I reread the book more recently, there were more things that I realized would have been chopped out of a version intended for 8th grade students to read, and I just hadn't noticed as much the first time reading the complete copy because they were tucked in with the more mundane things towards the beginning of Charlies developments.All ranting aside, I find this book to be a fascinating look at human nature, personality and development. It's well written, and does a good job placing you into Charlie's head as he goes up and down through this experiment. If you read it in school like I first did, do yourself a favor and buy or borrow a complete copy of the book to read. The lessons learned by all characters in the book certainly give you lots of think about your own behavior and that of others.EDIT: There have been a few comments pointing out that the story was a short story first, likely the version I read in my school textbook, that was later expanded into the novel. I only wanted to add this note to my review, as it seems some people comment without reading the other comments left, so I'm seeing both comments informing me of this fact and comments of outrage that the book was censored."}, {"userName": "Adina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22189348-adina", "userReview": "I read this 2 years ago, before I started writing more detailed reviews. I am not planning to modify my thoughts from back then but I want to add my father's thoughts. I gifted this book to him last Christmas and he finally got to read it. He was as deeply moved by this magnificent heart wrenching novel as I was and he felt the need to send me a message when he finished to tell how impressed he was. It was the first time he sent me an emotional message about a book so with his permission, I will paste here most of his words: \"Intelligence, a gift or a course? Yes, I finished the book and I am overwhelmed by many thoughts. Flowers for Algernon is one of those books that after you read you realize how much you would have lost if you hadn't read it. We can think of Charlie or of each of us who, as he does, we accumulate and then we loose what we got through hard work. However, as he, we need to know that it wasn't for nothing. Knowledge, accumulation, though, happiness, sadness, they all come from learning, books, from the ones around us. Intelligence might be a gift but it still has a price which we have to pay.\" There is more but that is a private daddy-daughter talk. I love sharing my love of books with my dad and I am emotional each time he loves one of the books i recommend. Read Flowers for Algernon! It is amazing, words cannot describe it. My original review:This book is extraordinary, one of my favorites. It is a fast read but is is very powerful and heartbreaking. I read it in the plane and I felt a little embarrassed when I started to weep at the end of the book. Even though I was expecting the ending the way it is written still broke my heart. I loved the way the book is written, as journal entries of an adult retard which is the subject of an experiment that makes him smart (a lot smarter). The writing at first is very childish but as the narrator changes so does the writing. Very clever. One of the things that I found to be most powerful was the way the narrator changed his view of others after becoming more intelligent and the way others changed their attitude towards him. I believe this should be read by everybody. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "When Charlie Gordon, a mentally disabled man, undergoes an experiment to increase his intelligence, his life changes in ways he never imagined. But will the intelligence increase be permanent.I first became aware of Flowers for Algernon when it was mentioned in an episode of Newsradio. I forgot about it until that episode of The Simpsons inspired by it, when it was discovered Homer had a crayon lodged in his brain. I'd mostly forgotten about it again until it popped up for ninety-nine cents in one of my BookGorilla emails.Flowers for Algernon is one of those stories I wish I would have read years earlier. It's simply marvelous. It's about the nature of intelligence and how intelligence can be divisive. It's a very emotional book.Personally, this was a very powerful book for me. For a lot of my time in school, I was way ahead of the curve and didn't really click with other kids. As Charlie's intelligence grew, eventually surpassing even the scientists that experimented on him, his feelings of isolation increased and I felt a lot of kinship toward Charlie. His difficulties fitting in were the cherry on top of the loneliness sundae.As Charlie's intelligence grew and he comprehended things from his past, it was hard not to feel sorry for him. Once he starts sliding backward, the book keeps getting more and more sad. Keyes doesn't mind kicking you in the emotional junk, that's for sure.I love the way the book is written in periodic progress reports from Charlie. It's perfect vehicle to show his increase in intelligence and eventual decline. There were man-tears shed over the course of the book. I had to set the book down a few times to keep from sobbing in my cube.Flowers for Algernon is one of those rare science fiction novels that transcends the genre.

This is up there with the likes of A Scanner Darkly and More Than Human. These are the sort of SF books that I would recommend to those who look down on the genre.This book explores such themes as the nature of intelligence, the effects of intelligence on the way you see others and the world around you, as well as social attitudes towards people with mental problems. The narrative structure is a series of progress reports, written by the protagonist, detailing his experiences throughout his period of experimental treatment. Thus we have a simple but clever way of portraying the changes in his perception and mental abilities which I don't think would have been as effective had it been written in the third person.One of the fascinating things about this story is seeing the way the attitudes of others towards him changed as he became more intelligent (not always for the better) and the way his view of others changed as he surpassed them. This has certainly changed the way I think about people with mental problems. A great example of how SF can give a writer tools for examining people and society that other genres lack."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Captivating and heartbreaking.Daniel Keyes 1958 novel about an intellectually disabled man who, through an experimental medical procedure, gains genius level IQ is a classic of science fiction.Charlie Gordon began attending classes at night for \u201cretarded adults\u201d so that he could learn to read and to \u201cbe like other people\u201d.

The protagonist, Charlie Gordon, has his IQ increased via a surgical procedure from that of a barely functional mentally retarded person to superhuman intelligence and writes the book in first person based on his experience. The procedure was first tried on lab mouse Algernon who the protagonist befriends and who is a litmus test of what he experiences. The maturity of the writing improves as he becomes smarter and smarter. However, (spoiler alert but then why would anyone read a book that left the story there?), things are not all rosy and Algernon has a sudden precipitous drop in IQ and dies in considerable confusion and pain. Now, can Charlie discover a cure and maintain the enhanced smarts? Does he want to? Is he condemned to go full circle and lose all his self-awareness? These questions are tackled throughout the book and make for great reading. This theme has since been addressed in sci fi (I read \"Understand\" by Ted Chiang this week on the same idea), but Keyes' treatment of it is both moving and insightful and a great read. Nota bene: At WebSummit in Lisbon this week, Bryan Johnson spoke of his new venture (after the $1B sale of Braintree to PayPal some years back) about bringing this kind of cognitive enhancement into the real world, but based on Charlie's experience, this terrorized rather than excited me. How do you feel about this inevitable new field of neuroscience?

A few shorter versions of the story exist, as well as film or TV adaptions for those who want to compare the literary art with the visual. I enjoyed this book when I read it the first time and even returned to reading the shorter version during a college English course. If you're not familiar with it, it's the story of Charlie, who at the time when this was written, may have been called \"mentally slow.\" If this took place in current times, it'd be a very different approach to both telling the story and to trying to help Charlie. So the book must be read and interpreted based on it being written nearly 50 years earlier.Charlie takes his time understanding everything around him, but at his core, you immediately see that he's a good guy. He loves a pet mouse named Algernon. They both go through a similar experiment and their intelligence begins growing, but then Algernon becomes very sick. No spoilers here, so you'll have to read it to see what happens to the mouse and to Charlie. The book for me was a great story to immerse yourself in from an emotional stance and a philosophical stance. People are different. Some are smart. Some are not smart. But there's a purpose for everyone. How far do we take medicine to help everyone? If everyone continues to get smarter, will we run out of supplies and space? If we don't help those who need it, will they become the less fortunate asked to do the harder manual work because they cannot think as well as others? All of these are questions which plague your mind as you read... as they did readers 50 years ago. I believe it's books like these that helped shape who America is today -- some great things came out of it, but also, some hurtful and potentially dangerous things came out of it. Though the intentions are not to divide people into segments and groups, that's what ends up happening. That said, the author and the story are to me, simply trying to tell a perspective, and then conversation and education help navigate that middle line of how to move forward. When you think about the mouse, you have love, guilt, fear, pain. When you see Charlie, you wonder... what happens to the future of our race? It's a great comparison and contrast to difference aspects of life and humanity. I'd like to read this again now that it's been over 20 years... just to see if I feel any differently. But I definitely think it's something people who enjoy reading should give a chance to. It's a broad sweep of what people think should be done to help others, as opposed to what the right decision is for the good of that individual.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

He catches Algernon and flees back to New York with Algernon, intent on getting his own apartment, where the scientists cannot find him. He feels a kinship with Aldernon, and realises that Algernon is a good predictor of his own future. The reader sees that Algernon, locked in a cage and forced to run through mazes at the scientists\u2019 whim, parallels Charlie\u2019s status for the scientists. His \"cage\" may be symbolic, but he is no less trapped. Like Algernon, he is allowed no dignity and no individuality. When he frees Algernon from his cage and decides to abandon the laboratory, the reader cheers, and recognises that this is the beginning of Charlie's emotional independence.In his new life, Charlie has realised that Professor Nemur\u2019s hypothesis contains an error. He now knows that it is very likely that his intelligence gain will only be temporary, and works on a possible solution. He forms a liaison with his neighbour, Fay Lillman, who is an attractive, free-living bohemian artist. Charlie does not tell Fay anything about his past, and although he is still in love with Alice, he has a sexual relationship with Fay, by ignoring his \"other self\".Charlie realises that he has an unsatisfied longing to meet his parents and sister, and manages to track them down. He remembers that his mother sent him away, but wants to make contact, come to terms with, and see if he can somehow resolve these issues. He has already begun to fear a regression to his previous level of intelligence, and has developed a sensitivity to the idea of things being left too late.\"It's astonishing how my power of recall is developing. I cannot control it completely, but sometimes when I'm busy reading or working on a problem, I get a feeling of intense clarity.I know it's some kind of subconsious warning system.\" He is surprised to find that Norma still lives with Rose, and that Norma neither hates him, nor is the vicious person he had expected her to be, but on the contrary is overjoyed to see him, having believed that Charlie had died at the Warren State Home a long time ago. However Rose's overwhelming desire to be what she perceives as normal, and her denial of reality, has now developed into dementia. Sometimes she thinks Charlie is a stranger, sometimes, like Norma, she is proud of his recent accomplishments. At other times the old irrational fear returns, and she once again thinks that he has come back to molest Norma. In a harrowing episode Rose tries to kill Charlie with a butcher's knife: another reminder of the past's pervasive influence on the present. It helps Charlie to understand the multilayered facts of human psychology, but despite Norma's pleas, he feels he has to retreat from their lives. Charlie tracks his father down, and discovers that Matt, now freed from Rose's irrational fantasies, has realised his dream of owning his own little barber's shop. But there is an inner sadness about Matt. Charlie comes very close to revealing who he is, but again realises that he can do nothing for his family,\"I wasn't his son. That was another Charlie. Intelligence and knowledge had changed me and he would resent me - as the others from the bakery resented me - because my growth had diminished him.\"When Algernon eventually dies, Charlie worries that he too is doomed. His behaviour becomes erratic, and he feels that there is nothing left for him but his work for the research laboratory. Charlie becomes totally committed to his work, to the point of obsession. He does succeed in finding the error in Nemur\u2019s hypothesis, poignantly naming it the \u201cAlgernon-Gordon Effect\u201d. Of course it also confirms to both him and us, that despite the operation, his intelligence will fade as quickly as it has come. Alice's feelings of guilt at her part in Charlie's situation mean that she desperately wants to care for him, and they do have a brief liaison, but as Charlie regresses further, he sends her away. Eventually he returns to his old job at the bakery, where everyone now knows his story. They are kind to him and welcome him back.Charlie's journal for the final parts of the story mirrors his crumbling intellect. He regresses to an earlier time when he used to attend Alice\u2019s night school classes for the mentally disabled, and he upsets her by showing up, as the \"old Charlie\", having completely forgotten their romantic relationship. Having planned for this time, he cuts himself off from all those who know and care for him, and voluntarily goes into the Warren State Home for disabled adults, knowing that his end is near.

At such moments my flesh is thin and tight, and the unbearable hunger to be part of it drives me out to search in the dark corners and blind alleys of the night.\"This book is absolutely a must-read! I've had it on my list to read for quite some time, not because I thought it would be fantastic, but because I thought to myself that here is a book almost everyone has read and somehow I have not. Well, having finished this masterpiece, I have to say wow! - Flowers for Algernon is truly incredible. So thought-provoking and almost emotionally overwhelming, I really felt this novel speaking to me about love, humanity, and our purpose and place in the world. Categorized as \"young adult\" and \"science fiction\", Flowers for Algernon is most certainly not just for the young adult and is not a science fiction novel in the typical sense (no space travel or otherworldly beings in these pages), but is instead a novel that goes just outside the box of realistic fiction. It goes just beyond the boundaries of what we have accomplished in science and medicine. Charlie Gordon is a young man with an I.Q. of 68. He works in a bakery doing custodial work while taking classes to learn to read and write. He is a happy person, feels he has many friends, and is also driven to please people and to make himself smarter. Having been cast aside by his family, most notably his mother, much of Charlie's thoughts and actions throughout the book are a result of how he was treated and rebuked as a child and his desire to be viewed as a \"normal\" individual. In fact, much of this book causes the reader to think that each and every one of us has the right to be regarded with dignity and respect no matter what our deficiencies or differences. When given the opportunity to increase his intelligence by a procedure previously tried only in animals, Charlie jumps at this rare chance. Feeling confident in their positive results with a mouse named Algernon, the experts are prepared to make the first step with this experimental surgery in humans and agree that Charlie is an ideal candidate. \"Dr. Strauss said I had something that was very good. He said I had a good motor-vation. I never even knowed I had that. I felt good when he said not everbody with an eye-Q of 68 had that thing like I had it. I dont know what it is or where I got it but he said Algernon had it too.\" Here, too, we can see Charlie's need to satisfy his family, even now that they are no longer a part of his life: \"If the operashun werks and I get smart mabye Ill be abel to find my mom and dad and sister and show them. Boy woud they be serprised to see me smart just like them and my sister.\"Following a successful surgery, Charlie indeed becomes smarter; he eventually surpasses the very individuals that achieved this medical and scientific accomplishment. But, with intelligence Charlie is confronted with hidden and often painful memories, an awareness of true human behavior and a struggle with the desire to rid himself of a feeling of loneliness. \"Intelligence is one of the greatest human gifts. But all too often a search for knowledge drives out the search for love.\" Charlie shifts from being a humble, mentally handicapped young man with many friends (though some of these friends had in fact been laughing at him) to a brilliant man whose intelligence and attitude of superiority isolates him from those friends. He is tormented by emotional and sexual immaturity despite his genius I.Q. As the novel is written in diary format, the reader is privy to Charlie's innermost thoughts throughout his journey and I was completely consumed by Charlie's emotions. I felt hopeful, joyful, enlightened, angry, confused and heartbroken right along with Charlie\u2026 I cried. Charlie begins to understand something very vital about human nature: \"I could see how important physical love was... The universe was exploding, each particle away from the next, hurtling us into dark and lonely space, eternally tearing us away from each other - child out of the womb, friend away from friend, moving from each other, each through his own pathway toward the goal-box of solitary death. But this was the counterweight, the act of binding and holding. As when men to keep from being swept overboard in the storm clutch at each other's hands to resist being torn apart, so our bodies fused a link in the human chain that kept us from being swept into nothing.\"I felt just as enraged as Charlie when he realized that prior to his surgery, he was not even considered a human being by some of the scientists to whom he owed his new-found intelligence. Professor Nemur termed his prior existence as being \"nature's mistake\" and went further to say that \"Charlie Gordon did not really exist before this experiment.\" Here, Charlie turned a corner and a sudden realization prompted him to dissociate himself from the other scientists and immerse himself in his own research to predict the final outcome of this experiment on both Algernon and himself. Is artificially-induced intelligence a permanent state? What can Charlie contribute to this field and does he have time? Flowers for Algernon is a beautiful and poignant story. Daniel Keyes effectively teaches us about the issue of living with a disability as well as parenting a child with a disability, love, respect, and the essential need for human connection and affection.

At the time, I had no idea it was such a groundbreaking novel. Reading it again many years later, I'm not surprised that it is powerful, but I am surprised at just how complete the story is. There were parts of the story that stuck with me all these years: Charlie's belief that his life would be better if he were somehow more intelligent and the heartache of his return to his former condition. It's difficult to verbalize why this regression should be so heartbreaking. Wasn't Charlie able to experience a life which somehow existed beyond his abilities (sort of like Lt. Barclay in Star Trek the Next Generation's Nth Degree episode)? Even if his newfound intelligence didn't last long, how long do any of us get to live at our full potential?

Meaning I was surprised to realize the majority of my Goodreads friends had already read a book that I had never heard of before. Correct me if I am wrong, but I suspect it was a requisite high school read for many. One reviewer mentioned the abridged version he read in school had trimmed all the sexual bits. What a shame! I may have arrived late, but at least that meant I was introduced to the raw version. The investigation of a 32 year old man struggling for the first time in his life to connect physically to women was insightful and decidedly unsexy. Also illuminating was how the character couldn\u2019t escape his loneliness. At both extremes of his intellectual abilities, from retarded (to use the term from the book) to genius, he was alienated from those around him \u2013 albeit for different reasons that broke my heart nonetheless. This exploration of a socially inept genius really resonated with me. I have met some smart people during my schooling and tangentially through my husband\u2019s. And I would go as far as to call a few of them potential geniuses. And some of them are weird.One guy in particular stands out. Let\u2019s call him Cheddar. Whenever my colleagues heard he was going to apply for a certain scholarship, we would all groan, because it meant we didn\u2019t have a chance. We could compete amongst ourselves and some outsiders, but not Cheddar. He won everything. (I will proudly interject that just once I won a scholarship for which he also applied. Well, we both won it. They couldn\u2019t decide between his analytical prowess and my whimsy. So they scrounged additional money to offer us both the scholarship. I thought about being offended that they labeled me the \u201cartsy one,\u201d but I decided to just take the money and run.)For a long time, I gaped at Cheddar\u2019s ease with numbers, graphs, equations, charts, rules, schemas. But looking back, I can see that he was, to a degree, socially challenged. Holding hands wasn\u2019t relaxed and comforting. Holding hands was an experiment on the most efficient way to interlock fingers with a fellow homo sapiens. He was incapable of keeping small secrets. Chitchatting with him could be difficult. When you stripped away his little group of loveable but dorky cohorts, he was vulnerable and hard pressed to communicate with the rest of world that doesn\u2019t speak in binary. Why, oh why, did I want to date him so badly?Keyes gave me an inside peek into how it might be for Cheddar and his fellow cheeses. How annoying it must be for them to constantly have to dumb it down enough to talk to the regular folk. (Also coming to mind right now is Sheldon Cooper from the television show, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d)So, there is a lot of truth in how Keyes portrayed this, dare I say, downside to being super-intelligent. And Keyes didn\u2019t stop there. He jammed many other profound topics into this short book: *the treatment of mentally disabled, *the wasting away of brilliance due to addiction, *the follies of arrogance,*people's confusion when others transform, and*ethics of tampering with someone\u2019s brain. And despite all that, the book remains very readable and emotionally resonant.

In medieval times, a physically strong man would consider himself superior to physically weaker one. A rich person would look down upon a poor person. And a more attractive person would consider himself to one who wasn't - and those with physical handicaps like a hunchback, blind or deaf would be made to face prejudice. A lot of it is still true but now I think at least now the best of minds don't think that physical strength, good looks or wealth don't make a person superior and that these qualities are largely things one is born with - gifts from God, chance or nature according to your belief.But it isn't so with intelligence (actually 'intelligence' as the word is popularly used - to mean logical intelligence and good memory; there are other forms of intelligence - read about them here; needless to say I am dumb in all of them) - we still think intelligence as something hard earned rather than a gift. Schools still rank children in terms of their supposed intelligence and no one complains about it creating inferiority complex that it might breed in children, the way many parents would if children were ranked according to their looks. Hannah Arendt in one of her books talked about Germans who seemed to regret the loss of geniuses (like Einstein for example) more than the other millions who died at the concentration camp. Another far less strong example is those thousands of Indian fans who think that crimes of some of the actors should be forgiven because of their genius in acting.Personally, I don't think being intelligent makes a person superior. It does, however, create a superiority complex. All it does like many other qualities is to make a person better qualified for some jobs. And I'm tired of people who think it is the only quality that matters. One keeps hearing these self-claimed intellectuals complain about others whom they consider less intelligent (what they real mean is less knowledgeable) of themselves getting jobs at their expense on account of their good looks and interaction skills (which are often qualities that jobs need more than mere knowledge).Now think, our schools exams, at least in India, measure only three qualities - memory and ability to logic and linguistic skills. There are several other forms of intelligence that are simply ignored. If an Einstein failed exams in this kind of system. What chance did Charlie Gorden have? It did, however, earn him a hard life. There is, of course, somewhere talk IQ tests which measure the very same three qualities and so he has a low IQ. Don't you think he would have a higher IQ if some other qualities were also included in tests? Maybe, it isn't the students who are failing. Maybe it is a failure of examiners. Charlie wish to be more intelligent was result of her mother's wishing so much the same thing, and her mother tried to force him to study too much because she lived in a society where intelligence is thought of result of hard work rather than a gift.This book has proved thoughts on a lot of other themes but I will focus only on one more.\nOn Lab rats\nWhere I live, there is a saying that one should be kind be to bezuban (the ones who can't speak - a word used for animals) because their reproaches are the first to be heard in the netherworld. And so using animals for experiments which will only benefit humans doesn't suit to me. But then what are the alternatives? because progress inScience has done a lot of good. what are our alternatives?Using humans? One alternative I know from Friends is that they offer money to people who will volunteer to take experimental drugs, but I think of it as nothing but economic slavery.That there have been times in history when humans were forced to act as subjects of experiments is hardly a secret. And that has been especially so in case of mentally retarded people. Many governments in past have considered sterilizing them forcefully. At least, Nazis for one had actually done it.And the subject is more tricky than you think. I think a lot of abuse is done to them - and the underdogs of the society in general in name of their own good. And so, diseased animals are killed so that their fellow animals won't catch the disease. Women are asked not to go out in open for their own safety. Nazis decided to give a 'merciful death' to all mental patients and called it Euthanasia. And even if one doesn't believe in paradise, there are other reasons to be warned as this was really stepping on a slippery slope down the hill of morality - because it was this very technique of mass assassination that was later used for Final Solution in concentration camps"}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "It's funny how things often come in pairs. Braveheart and Rob Roy. Armageddon and Deep Impact. Dangerous Liaisons and Valmont. And quite often, the better one of the pair isn't the one that ends up becoming famous.Flowers for Algernon's twin is Thomas Disch's \nCamp Concentration\n. Both novels were published within a few months of each other. Both are first-person narratives, presented as a series of diary entries written by the main character. Both address the same question: suppose a medical procedure were invented that could make people much, much smarter. What would happen?Now given the rules of the game, how are you going to present the narrator getting smarter? Keyes picked the obvious solution: in this book, Charlie Gordon starts off real dumb. You read the early entries in his dirie, and he rites like thiss. hees ilitrate and he dont even no wot it means. but hes a good guy with a big hart. Charlie is given the procedure, and he starts getting smarter. Of course, it's technically quite easy for Keyes to show his vocabulary, grammar and spelling improving, and the way he gains more insight into his situation. The trickiest thing in the book is the romance. Charlie's always had a crush on the nice teacher at his evening class, but he's never been able to do a thing about it. Now he's able to put the moves on her. But as he gets more and more intelligent, he finds he's outgrown her. He meets a brilliant woman artist and starts up a new relationship with her. At the apex of his trajectory, Charlie is a world-class scientist. He turns his intelligence on himself and learns that his brilliance is only temporary. Soon, he will lose all his new powers. He will inexorably descend the curve again, and before long he will be as dumb as he was at the beginning. Shortly after that, he will die. He dispassionately presents all these discoveries in a scientific paper. Not long after, the decline begins. He can no longer read the things he's just written. His relationship with the artist is over. The most heart-rending scene is when he's returned to his old level: forgetful and confused, he goes back to his evening class and sees the nice teacher again, not even remembering their brief affair. She runs out of the room weeping, and he can't quite figure out why. In the last diary entry, he half-understands that he is a few days from death, and leaves instructions to the person who finds the diary.Keyes has a clear plan in mind and succeeds well in what he sets out to do. The book is quite well known, got made into a movie, and has even ended up on school reading lists. But Disch wanted to try something much riskier. His hero starts out, not just normal, but already pretty smart. Moreover, he's a writer, though admittedly not a very successful one. Now what would you get when you took a smart writer and made him enormously smarter? How would you depict that through the medium of his own writing?It's obviously impossible, and Camp Concentration has indeed never become famous. Of the few people that look at it, most remain deeply unimpressed; Not, who read it last week on my recommendation (sorry, Not!) found it pretentious and boring. But somehow I prefer Disch's ambitious failure to Keyes's easy success. Keyes engages my emotions, but Disch manages to hit me somewhere deeper down. Perhaps it's a more interesting kind of tragedy."}, {"userName": "Brian Yahn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22849115-brian-yahn", "userReview": "More than anything else, Flowers for Algernon is thought provoking.

Charlie Gordon becomes the human guinea pig. The procedure goes well and he becomes exceptionally bright, during this brief time many lessons are learnt, although he becomes a genius in terms of I.Q he learns he is still emotionally stunted, he can't always manage his emotions in a rational way and many discoveries with regressions into his painful past come to light causing Charlie to reevaluate the decision of taking part in the experiment, just as he makes some progress forward in his personal relationships things take a downward turn and the tables reverse again. His new awareness and heightened knowledge becomes it's own curse. This is much more than a scientific medical experiment for Charlie but a life changing examination of his future, past and present. The fact that society treated people like Charlie in such a hostile and degrading manner made me feel ashamed about the way we devalued people with lower intellect. It's the nature of the superiority complex, which shows up so evidently in Charlie's case, in so many more ways than one. I was often overcome with extreme emotions during the reading of this novel and I could go on and on about the merits of this book. What I know is that once I started this book I couldn't stop reading it even though my eyes were constantly tearing up.

They are so smugly sure of their analysis of the whys and wherefores of human nature, yet they still cling to the archetypes. Charlie knows The Puffed-up Scientist and The Down-to-earth Scientist. The women in his life are The Cruel Mother, The Whore, and The Angel. (One of the reasons this book screams the 60s is because The Angel is ok with his relationship with The Whore. In fact, she encourages it. Brilliant. Can we tell the author was a man and the book was written in the era of \"free love\"?) All of this in a book that is supposed to be about a man coming to grips with new found intelligence without turning into an intellectual jerk and divining the REAL NATURE of the women in his life.

Everyone saw it, and one girl, I can\u2019t remember her name, had a Charly protective book cover and was so obsessed with the movie that she\u2019d write the name, with the backwards \u201cR\u201d on everything, including adding it as a middle name to her own name on tests and papers she would hand in. She was in all the school plays and sang beautifully so my guess is her connection was with the play and the movie as opposed to the subject of the story. Or maybe she just had a thing for Cliff Robertson.Flowers for Algernon is expanded from an original short story and is the tale of Charlie Gordon, a retarded man with an IQ of 68. Chosen to take part in a groundbreaking experiment, Charlie soon finds himself gaining knowledge at record speed until, in a short period of time, his IQ nearly triples.Written in epistolary style, the plot is moved along through Charlie\u2019s regular 'Progress Reports' which he begins writing just before his operation and detail his day-to-day life and thoughts. Even if you haven\u2019t seen the movie or read the short story, Charlie\u2019s journey is easy to predict, but that doesn\u2019t ruin the story, it makes it all the sadder.There were some passages that made me think the book was maybe a little too long and that maybe some of those slower passages took away from the overall story, but once I was past them I realized that wasn\u2019t the case. Those passages were just different pieces to the puzzle and only added to the richness of the story and to the depth of Charlie.There\u2019s a scene about halfway through the book where Charlie goes to a diner after taking a walk. Charlie is watching the restaurant\u2019s busboy working, and he recognizes something of himself in the 16-year-old worker. As Charlie watches, the busboy drops some dishes and the restaurant manager comes over and begins verbally abusing the boy who cowers in terror of being hit. Eventually the restaurant customers begin teasing the boy and Charlie watches, seeing himself in the boy, until he can\u2019t watch any longer. Charlie stands and shouts for everyone to leave the boy alone because he can\u2019t help who he is. He\u2019s just human. Charlie leaves the restaurant in shame and thinks to himself, \u201cHow strange it is that people of honest feelings and sensibility, who would not take advantage of a man born without arms or legs or eyes \u2013 how such people think nothing of abusing a man born with low intelligence.\u201d I share that passage because the message I took from Flowers for Algernon was that there are bits of Charlie - both pre and post-operation Charlie - in everyone. If we forget that, or lose that, then we start to lose our humanity and our connection to the world and at that point it doesn't matter if our IQ is 68 or 185. In the end, our lives aren\u2019t measured by how smart we are, but by how we treat others and interact with others. Our humanity isn't a measure of our intelligence, but rather whether or not we can remember flowers for Algernon.Flowers for Algernon is a beautiful story."}, {"userName": "Rita", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032308-rita", "userReview": "One of the most touching stories ever written. And no, it's not Romance! It's Sci-Fi. This is a first person narrative that has been written as a series of progress reports from a deeply retarded man, who can barely be considered literate. His writing is ful of bad grammar and spelling mistakes. At first, if you are not prepared for it, this makes this book a little hard to read, and some passages even have to be re-read a couple of times before you understand them. Our protagonist goes through experimental brain surgery, that has the effect of gradually increasing his intelligence to that of a genius. His change from a retarded to a genius is beautifully conveyed by his improved spelling, grammar, sentence constructions, reflections and the way he relates and connects to his surroundings (and also how they relate to him in return). His journey is a tragic one, filled with regrets, hopes and dreams.This is one of the most heart-breaking stories that I have ever read. I read it first time in high school (the original short story) back in the late 80s/early 90s, and I haven't been able to let go of it since. This is one of those very rare books that just stays with you forever, whether you want it to or not. It's simply unforgettable, and it challenges you in more than one way.

25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "I\u2019ve known about this novel since I was in high school but didn\u2019t get around to reading it until just recently at the age of 33 (coincidentally the same age as the protagonist!). I read a Simpsons comic and watched an episode of the Simpsons TV show which both covered the same story so I felt like I didn\u2019t need to read the original. But I\u2019m glad I finally checked out Daniel Keyes\u2019 Flowers For Algernon because it\u2019s actually really good - it definitely deserves its classic status. Charlie Gordon is a simpleton with an IQ of 68. Working as a cleaner at a bakery, Charlie wishes he was smarter so people will respect him more so he volunteers for experimental surgery to do just that - and it works! His IQ triples and Charlie is a new man in a whole new world. And then he discovers that the successful test mouse, Algernon, has started regressing and realises that his time as a genius is growing shorter and shorter\u2026 Flowers For Algernon is labelled a SF classic but really the brilliant premise is the book\u2019s only sci-fi aspect. It\u2019s actually an unexpectedly very powerful and dramatic human story which I feel makes it not just a genre classic but easily a literary one too. I only mention the distinction because often old SF books are badly written and cheesy as all hell and Daniel Keyes\u2019 novel is nothing like that. Keyes cleverly chooses to write the story in the first person so we can see the change in Charlie\u2019s intelligence through the writing which starts off with poor spelling, language and grammar until, following the surgery, it improves until it\u2019s perfect. More than that though, Keyes writes Charlie\u2019s voice beautifully. It\u2019s convincing at every stage of his transformation and even when he\u2019s simpleton Charlie the writing never comes off cartoonishly or mocking. Keyes\u2019 greatest accomplishment in this novel is the character of Charlie Gordon who\u2019s a bonafide unique literary creation up there with the likes of Huck Finn and Captain Ahab. Once Charlie becomes a genius, he starts seeing his old self in eerie out-of-body hallucinations. It\u2019s an inspired approach because in a very real sense these two Charlies are completely separate but also it puts the new Charlie in the same position as the reader, learning about the old Charlie\u2019s past at the same time through revisiting old memories that he\u2019s now able to understand with this sudden gift of intelligence. Keyes also notes the subtle distinction between academic intelligence and emotional intelligence. So while Charlie is able to speed-read numerous books and become adept at various disciplines and languages, emotionally he\u2019s still child-like, as we see when he tries to express his feelings to the woman he falls for, Alice Kinnian. And that\u2019s another bitter twist of irony in the tale: simple Charlie was happy with his life and had friends; genius Charlie finds his intelligence isolates him, he loses his old friends, and he becomes unhappy. He hoped cleverness would make him more friends but the opposite happened - be careful what you wish for. In fact, it only made him more miserable after he realised his old friends sometimes behaved cruelly to him. Charlie realises intelligence doesn\u2019t make you happy or give you a fulfilled life - human contact does. It\u2019s a somewhat elementary but profound truth. The story lost me for a while in the middle when Charlie and Algernon escaped from the science conference in a hammy sequence (people shrieking and leaping onto chairs as Algernon the mouse ran free) and Charlie dating the bohemian artist was meandering, overlong and a bit pointless. I also feel like Keyes didn\u2019t fully explore the possibilities of Charlie\u2019s genius IQ and that this was done better in the Bradley Cooper movie Limitless which had a similar premise and was obviously inspired in part by Keyes\u2019 novel. But the book ends strongly once Charlie learns that he\u2019s going to lose his smarts and decides to track down and reconnect with his estranged parents and sister. The scene between him, his abusive mother and his sister blew me away - it was the kind of moving drama I\u2019d expect to see in an Arthur Miller play rather than a SF novel (sorry to keep ragging on SF but, having read enough shitty SF novels, I feel like it\u2019s earned it!). A lot of the book is kind of a downer but Keyes\u2019 writing was too compelling to not keep going and the ending is quietly positive albeit also unapologetically sentimental. Oof, it\u2019s such an emotional read! Yeah, I enjoyed Flowers For Algernon and highly recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Sagan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53505099-elizabeth-sagan", "userReview": "Whenever I have to make a gift and I\u2019m thinking of buying a book, knowing that the person isn\u2019t an avid reader, I\u2019m thinking of buying Flowers for Algernon.

The narrative here is based around a series of reports by its first human test subject. At first sight and based on this initial premise, wasn\u2019t this just going to be yet another run-of-the-mill sci-fi story of experimental lab work on human subjects\u2026hadn\u2019t we seen all this many, many times before? Clearly not \u2013 with \u2018Flowers for Algernon\u2019 what Daniel Keyes has produced is a book, which like all great books, easily transcends the limits of the genre (in this case sci-fi) to which others are sadly confined. This is a truly compelling, intelligent, original and thought-provoking story examining with alacrity themes of \u2018intelligence\u2019, mental health and disability issues. Keyes shines a light on the moral and ethical issues related to experimental surgery such as that suggested in this story, as well as looking at the way society treats those with mental health issues. The story of test subject Charlie Gordon is a very human story. \u2018Flowers for Algernon\u2019 is a truly engaging, moving and intelligent novel \u2013 recommended."}], "description": "Charlie Gordon is about to embark upon an unprecedented journey.
