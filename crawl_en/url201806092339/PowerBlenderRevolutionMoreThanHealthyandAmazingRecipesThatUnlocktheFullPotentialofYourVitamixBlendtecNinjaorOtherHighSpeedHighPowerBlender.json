I bought my Vitamix six years ago. Ever since, I drink a green smoothie every day, and I\u2019ve noticed I am sick far less often. I also notice if I skip a day because I\u2019ll feel sluggish. I worship my Vitamix and have discovered it\u2019s for so much more than just smoothies, as this book illustrates. Some recipes are marked vegan, and there are also vegetarian and meat-centered recipes. Power Blender Revolution is a well-rounded instructional and recipe book for powerful blenders! I bolded each of the recipe sections below and highlighted some I can\u2019t wait to try! The Basics - cheeses, flours, etc. I love grating cheese in my blender because it\u2019s quick and the clean-up is a breeze. 3 Day Juice and Smoothie Cleanses are outlined. It tells you what to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and desserts based on recipes in the book. Things to Drink/Whole Food Juices These are great if you have a juicer. Smoothies, Drinks, and SlushiesA couple things I want to try asap:Kiwi Colada Smoothie with canned coconut milk Sugar Cookie Smoothie with dates and cashews Cherry Pecan Pie Smoothie with kaleCoffee Drinks, Matcha Drinks, and CreamersNut Milks and Other Nondairy MilksPistachio Milk!

NOW AVAILABLE !!Almost five years ago, I bought a Vitamix. I used to use it daily, making healthy smoothies for myself, but I never read or heard about different recipes until recently. When I read my goodreads friend Jennifer\u2019s review for this book, I knew I wanted to read this and find some other ways to introduce some more creative and some more varied recipes. It\u2019s more difficult to obtain quantities of fresh fruit, or even frozen depending upon where you live, but now that warmer days are approaching, I am looking forward to enjoying some fresh local fruit. After reading this book and looking at each and every recipe, most of which I was wishing I was sampling as I was reading the ingredients, I knew this was the incentive I needed.With over 300 recipes, the sections include: Power Blender 7-Day Clean Eating PlanPower Blender 3-Day Juice and Smoothie CleanseWhole Food JuicesSmoothies, Shakes, and SlushiesCoffee Drinks, Matcha Drinks, and CreamersNut Milks and Other Nondairy MilksJames, Butters, and SyrupsGuacamoles, Hummuses, and Other Dips and SpreadsAll-Purpose Sauces, Pestos, and CondimentsDressings, Vinaigrettes, Marinades, and Spice BlendsSmoothie BowlsSoupsEntrees From the BlenderVegetables SidesMuffins, Pancakes, and Other Quick BreadsDesserts From the BlenderSorbets, Ice Creams, and PopsiclesBaby Food Pur\u00e9esMasks, Washes and More for Your Skin: Body Wash, Face Wash, Body Scrub, Body Lotions, Exfoliation Masks, Skin Brightening Masks, Moisture MasksThere\u2019s a balance of vegan and vegetarian and meat-based recipes. There\u2019s also information on using your blender to grind meat, churn butter, and other things, depending on which blender you are using. I\u2019m planning on buying a few copies of this, one for me, and the rest of my family.Many thanks to my goodreads friend Jennifer, whose wonderful, and more detailed, review inspired me to read this.

The author has provided over 300 recipes and also walks the reader through helpful skills such as churning butter, grinding meat, and wait for it...making your own homemade, toxic free skincare. Yep! I appreciated that the author provided an introduction to the world of power blenders for newbies or blender owners who might not know just how much their blender is capable of, and I absolutely loved that many of the recipes includes a tidbit of extra information. There really is a wealth of knowledge in this cookbook. Power Blender Revolution covers a variety of dietary/nutritional needs such as vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, and low-sugar. Each recipe is marked with a symbol to inform the reader which needs are addressed. The recipes and gorgeous photography fall under the following categories:1-Whole Food Juices2-Smoothies, Shakes, and Slushies3-Coffee Drinks, Matcha Drinks, and Creamers4-Nut Milks and Other Nondairy Milks5-Jams, Butters, and Syrups6-Guacamoles, Hummuses, and Other Dips and Spreads7-All-Purpose Sauces, Pestos, and Condiments8-Dressings, Vinaigrettes, Marinades, and Spice Blends9-Smoothie Bowls10-Soups11-Entrees from the Blender12-Vegetable Sides13-Muffins, Pancakes, and Other Quick Breads14-Desserts from the Blender15-Sorbets, Ice Creams, and Popsicles16-Baby Food Purees17-Masks, Washes, and More for Your SkinI thought I was already pretty adventurous with my blender. I currently use it to grind oat flour, make salsa, puree ingredients for curries, and of course the common fruit smoothies. But I have to admit this cookbook has me excited. I'm all about homemade versus store-bought when the opportunity and knowledge presents itself and now I have absolutely no excuses. Check it out! Thank you to the following for permitting me access to an advance reader's copy (ARC) of Power Blender Revolution.

The Benefits Of Using A Power Blender follow with information on How To Use The Book, Tools And Accessories, Essential Advice, and Special Techniques.Next comes the Power Blender 7-Day Clean Eating Plan, providing a seven-day meal plan with recipe names and page numbers.

I found that throughout the book the blending tips were very helpful in providing information that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily find in an instruction manual but which could make the difference in a recipe.Finding the Masks, Washes, And More For Your Skin recipes included in the Things You Can Eat section was very strange. Otherwise, I found the selection to be excellent.The sheer variety of recipes which can be created with a blender was surprising. The fact that you can make so many different things with that one piece of equipment is convenient and helps keep down with the number of dishes you have to clean.See the full review and the recipe for Skin-Brightening Kiwi And Lemon Facial Mask at The RecipesNow!

The 7 day cleanse eating plan diet along with the wonderful daily menus, instructions on making and using the following recipes sound great. The smoothie bowl recipes look and sound just like a wonderful way to start a day and the two smoothie recipes I managed to try were, very, very yummy-alicious.

I have used my blender for smoothies and occasionally for soup, but this book showed me how to use it for so much more. This book has two sections to break the recipes into Part 1 Things to Drink and Part 2 Things to Eat. Each recipe starts with a brief introduction describing something about the recipe. The book is filled with vibrant pictures and each recipe notes if it is vegan, gluten free, dairy free, nut free, and/or low sugar to make it easier to use with any diet restrictions. Some of my new favorite recipes (and these are just a sampling of the many recipes in this book) are:Things to Drink:Chapter 1 Whole Food Juices: Strawberry Pineapple Lemonade Juice, Cranberry Juice Crush, Simple Orange Juice, and Red Apple Juice. The apple juice is so much better than traditional store bough apple juice.Chapter 2 Smoothie, Shakes, and Slushies: Berry Oat Breakfast Shake (who knew you could put oatmeal in a smoothie? The chapter also has recipes that include cashews, broccoli, and turmeric\u2026) and Frozen Lemonade Slushie.Chapter 3 Coffee Drinks, Matcha Drinks, and Creamers: this chapter wasn\u2019t for me; I am not a fan of coffee.Chapter 4 Nut Milks and Other Non-Dairy Milks: Cashew Milk, Chocolate Macadamia Milk, and several nut milks with fruit add-ins.Things to Eat:Chapter 5 Jams, Butters, and Syrups: Whipped Garlic Herb Butter and Chocolate Hazelnut Spread.Chapter 6 Guacamoles, Hummuses, and Other Dips and Spreads: Caramelized Sweet Onion Dip, Simple Hummus (and all the hummus varieties), Spicy Cheese Guacamole, and Chicken Spread.Chapter 7 All-Purpose Sauces, Pestos, and Condiments: Classic Ketchup, Cauliflower Alfredo Sauce, Arugula Lemon Pesto (this may be my favorite recipe in the whole book), and Vegan Sour Cream.Chapter 8 Dressings, Vinaigrettes, Marinades, and Spice Blends: Strawberry Vinaigrette (the strawberries just add something amazing), Cilantro Lime Dressing (my new go-to salad dressing), Classic French Dressing, and Turmeric Ginger Vinaigrette.Chapter 9 Smoothie Bowls: Peanut Butter Cup Smoothie Bowl and Lemon Cr\u00e8me Superfood Smoothie Bowl.Chapter 10 Soups: (this is my favorite chapter\u2026soup is so quick and easy in the blender!) Broccoli Cheddar Soup, Black Bean Soup, Spinach and Broccoli Soup, and Tomato, White Bean, and Basil Soup.Chapter 11 Entrees from the Blender: Whole Wheat Margherita Pizza, Cauliflower Crust Pizza, and Mashed Chickpea Lettuce Wrap.Chapter 12 Vegetable Sides: Classic Coleslaw (the blender makes shredding cabbage so easy!) and Cheese and Chive Cauliflower Mash.Chapter 13 Muffins, Pancakes, and Other Quick Breads: Cheddar Biscuits, Classic Crepes, Broccoli and Cheese Frittata, Quinoa Flatbread Pita, and Pao de Queso Cheese Rolls.Chapter 14 Desserts from the Blender: Peanut Butter Chocolates, No Bake Individual Cheesecakes, and Raw Strawberry Cheesecake.Chapter 15: Sorbets, Ice Creams, and Popsicles: Strawberry Sorbet, Pineapple Whip Sorbet, Peach Ice Cream, and Double Chocolate Ice Cream (so easy and so good).Chapter 16: Baby Food Purees: I don\u2019t have a baby so I did not try any of the recipes in this chapter.Chapter 17: Masks, Washes, and More for Your Skin: Avocado Oat Exfoliation Mask and Skin-Brightening Kiwi and Lemon Facial Mask.The only downside to this book for me is I wish there were companion recipes. For instance there is a recipe for Green Enchilada Sauce, but no Enchilada recipe to go with it. I think that would have been a great addition to this book.
