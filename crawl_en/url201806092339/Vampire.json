Encounters with the Vampires of the title are heart-stopping affairs. They are feisty fiends: fast, inhumanly strong and very vicious. They\u2019re also not in the least interested in being your boyfriend (or girlfriend).It\u2019s a gritty story, filled with blood, sweat and Texas dust; one where listening to Stevie Ray Vaughn may just save your life - literally. All in all, it\u2019s a solid story that is pretty fast paced for the most part. Even though the horror is based on jack-in-the-box scares and doesn\u2019t really creep up on you, it doesn\u2019t feel cheap at all. Indeed, this book is pretty darn scary at times.There are even some poignant moments:And then he stood up to retrieve a blazing skull that had rolled away from the flames. He eased it gently back into the fire with the head of his axe.I\u2019m subtracting a star, because the Fourth Interlude dragged a bit, although this bit impressed me, being the complete antithesis of the (silly) modern notion of a \u201cromantic\u201d vampire:She saw him differently now, in his pain, and her contempt was joyous. There was no seduction here, no hypnotic gaze, no Voice. His skin was no longer smooth cream, but mottled, crinkled, paste.The Undead, she kept thinking.All those movies and all those stories I've seen and read in my life were fantasies.But this is so true. He is not alive. He is Undead. He is Unhealthy.He is scum."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "3.5 stars. Don't start this book looking for a more detailed version of the John Carpenter film. Except for the opening scene which is fairly similar in both the book and the movie, the book is completely different (and much better). Nothing high brow here, Jack Crow (and later his buddy Felix) are hard drinking, foul talking, ill-mannered \"western\" type tough guys who track and kill vampires for a living. This is pretty typical \"action hero\" type stuff (I was reminded of Nick Nolte in 48 hours and James Woods in the movie Cop), but the author does it fairly well. What I thought was interesting was the portrayal of the vampires which I thought was a unique blend of the pure evil monster vampire that used to be the standard and the hollywood \"sexy killer\" vampire made famous by Anne Rice in her Complete Vampire Chronicles. The main vampires in this book are portrayed on the surface as fairly handsome and successful men who have the \"ability to mesmerize and hypnotize\" people into doing whatever they want them to. What is unique is that what the vampires want to do is subject their victims to the most CRUEL AND SADISTIC rituals in which they are degraded, humiliated, sexually violated (often in front of their loved ones who are helpless to stop it) all for the sick pleasure of the vampire before they are ultimately and brutally killed. This was shocking (and at times difficult to read) but I did think it was a unique take on the vampire so I given the author points for that. Well the bad \"good\" guys and the very bad vampires resolve their differences in a series of very bloody fights that leads to a \"non-hollywood\" ending that is still satisfying. Overall, a decent book for those looking for a fairly unique take on the vampire along with a \"shoot um up\" action story."}, {"userName": "Monica Medina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/414515-monica-medina", "userReview": "Seriously.

It's not going to change the world. It's about vampire hunters. But I loved every character, I love the story the author told, I cared what happened. It could be that it was my age when I read it.

Of course, Monster Hunter International is already out there.I've said a couple of things I'm going to say here before, about other books. This one makes me sad. As I've said before, I really wanted to like this book. And also as I've said before, the book is a mixed bag. There are some very good parts then again there are some parts that I found so stultifyingly slow I could have screamed. When it was over, I was really ready for it to be over. Sad.The book sets out to tell the story of Jack Crow and his team of vampire slayers. They do it for money and because it has to be done. I never saw the movie based on this book, but I'm told after the opening scene that the two bear almost no resemblance. As I said the book is very much a mixed bag. It has areas or parts of almost brilliant writing interspersed between long dull background filler and plot exposition. The book reads to me like an overly long climax tale, as if it's the climax of a much longer work. And I don't mean longer in sheer length but longer in the sense that we would have profited from more of a \"before story\" instead of trying to bring us in where the writer did and then trying to fill us in with background stories (\"interludes\"), conversations and shots of mental struggles. The story is rife with emotional strain and all the people are already almost to the breaking point when we join them. The angst is so thick that you can cut it with a knife all through the novel and we're told it's all because of their never ending struggle, \"what went before.\"Steakley also wrote Armor and that was my introduction to him. It's also why I bought this book. Wish I'd gotten the library edition as I doubt I'll ever go back to it. I've read some reviews from people who love this book and at least one from a reader who says they have worn out several copies. I'm glad they like it, it shows the difference in taste. I suppose that if you can get involved with the emotional struggles going on here it will help.But I never did. Felix got on my nerves, Jack was broken from the time we met him and for both of them we spent most of the book putting together their emotional baggage and the horrors that made of them what they are. The other characters have less depth (and actually Jack and Felix aren't really painted in full three dimensions).All in all somewhat okay, not really great and I can't get behind it and/or recommend it. Everyone will need to decide on this one themselves. Some good writing mixed in with some very slow story telling. Not great but not horrible. A borderline 2 stars."}, {"userName": "Bryan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2904866-bryan", "userReview": "Not a perfect book, and it's not like I'm well-read when it comes to Vampire novels, but I highly recommend this one. Don't bother with that Twilight stuff, here's the real blood and guts (and spines and viscera and...)So what's so great about the book?1) The creatures. There are various levels of vampires, and all of them are bloodthirsty fiends. They start as goons (basically shambling zombies), then graduate up to vampire status, and finally \"master\" vampire. Superbly chilling monsters - they can control a human's will and are beautiful, but this is not your romantic \"she fell in love with a vampire\" by any means. These creatures want to slit your throat and bathe in your blood.2) The team. There was just something fascinating about the devil-may-care hard-drinking foul-mouthed group of vampire hunters. They don't really know all there is to know about vampires, but they're the best there is and they make it up as they go along. (I actually felt the book lost stride when it focused on the master vampires too much... I liked the mystery and the cavalier attitude it fostered in Team Crow).3) The characters. Admittedly similar to #2 above, but the way the team acted still doesn't give enough credit to the individual characters themselves, so I wanted to give special mention here.4) The writing style. Steakley didn't strive to make this a literary masterpiece. But he did perfect the rough and off-hand conversational style that kept the book moving along briskly and fit in perfectly with the type of testosterone-charged heroes he was writing about. Could not have been done better in any other style of narrative!What were the drawbacks? Sometime the pacing would drag (especially when Jack Crow was recounting his first encounters with Felix, and when the damsel in distress was giving the details about the master vampire). But I have to admit that these were important, so I'm not sure how else Steakley might have found ways to solve this. For the most part, the plot was chillingly tight, and events moved quickly.I did cringe a bit when it was revealed that \"vampires don't like rock'n'roll\". It kind of made it ironic that Jack Crow always spurred his team into action by saying \"rock'n'roll\" (even though he didn't know it at the time). The author needed vampires to like opera, but I found this a bit contrived.If you're interested in the gritty details of how to fight vampires (and what can go wrong if the fiends get a split second to rip through the humans bold enough to think they can slay these mighty beings), then look no farther.After reading this, try the novella I Am Legend for yet another vampire tale that is truly original and avoids any \"Twilight\" factor..."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/316799-mark", "userReview": "Vampire$ is the second book by John Steakley. If the character names are familiar, it's because they are recycled from his previous novel, \"Armor\". Jack Crow, instead of being a famous space pirate, is now the leader of a group that hunts and kills vampires for profit. Felix, rather than being an expert ant-killer, is now a gunman.The Plot:Jack Crow leads a Vatican-subsidized band of mercenaries whose sole purpose is to kill vampires. Usually, vampires invade a small town and then sort of spread to take it over, like a disease. The townships hire the vampire hunters to come in and kill the vampires before that happens. They do this using a brute force approach consisting of destroying the house they inhabit, and then pulling apart the wreckage to expose them to the sun.On the latest job, they successfully kill all of the vampires in an afflicted town. Afterwards, they are celebrating in a local hotel at night when a vampire \"master\" breaks up the party and kills almost everyone in the mercenary group. The twist is, the master vampire knows Jack Crow's name and who he is. Jack Crow has to get together a new band of hunters; one of whom is Felix, a gunman. Steakley defines a Felix as a \"gunman\", which is an individual whose prowess with guns is so great, they become an extension of his body, rather than a handheld tool or weapon.The rest of the book is Jack Crow and company being hunted by vampires by night, and hunting the vampires coming after them by day.The Good:I liked the way vampires were portrayed in \"Vampire$\". They are portrayed as godlike, impossibly beautiful monsters who possess the strength to rip a man in half as if he were made of tissue paper...and they do. Steakley made vampires scary for me again, and that hasn't happened for me since Stephen King's \"'Salem's Lot\" or Robert McCammon's \"They Thirst\". Absent here are the romantic bisexual heroes of Anne Rice's novels. That is not to say that there is no sexuality to the vampires in this novel; there is. However, it's more of a humiliation/non-consensual kind of eroticism: a rape of the soul. Steakley does a good job of reigning it in, though, before it metamorphoses into hardcore pornography. That's a good thing, because it just wouldn't \"fit\" into the story like it would in an Anita Blake or Anne Rice novel.The characters are compelling, and Steakley does a good job of depicting their reactions to their encounters with the vampires: their shock at realizing that vampires actually exist, their awe at the strength and speed at which the vampires move, and their post-traumatic stress at surviving an encounter with a \"little god\".The Bad:Some of the characters are a little one-dimensional. There's a \"damsel-in-distress\" character that, I feel, could have been fleshed out a little more. Also, even though Steakley does go into the psyches of his characters, it's not quite as compelling as his portrayals in \"Armor\", his first novel.He does go into the perspective of the vampires a little bit, but his vampires are wholly evil. They aren't people who need blood to survive; they are evil beings who kill and cause suffering out of a desire to do so. I kind of wish that the vampires were a little more amoral rather than immoral. However, for the purposes of the story, I guess they HAD to be as evil as they were depicted.My Rating:It's the best vampire novel I've read in a long time. It was not just a horror novel; it's a thrill ride. If you're someone who wants to read about vampires as purely evil demonic beings, this will be your cup of tea. If you're a fan of Anita Blake or Anne Rice, you'll either be disappointed that their kind of vampires are absent, or interested in reading a different perspective.I say give it a shot for the fresh perspective alone. I don't know of many vampire novels that depict vampire hunters, other than the Anita Blake series.It's definitely a \"good read\"."}, {"userName": "Terence", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence", "userReview": "[whose eventual self-sacrifice is meant to be emotionally wrenching but falls flat (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Naten", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/922045-naten", "userReview": "When James Woods asked John Carpenter for a copy of the script to the movie based on this novel, the director should have just handed him the book.

Parts of it were rousing adventure/horror; other parts not so much. I grew tired fast with all the tears and uber testosterone weep-fests that occured after every vampire encounter. And I found vast chunks of the book as weirdly sentimental as Beth's death in Little Women. Also the style of writing is a little florid. Don't get me wrong, the writing is a cut above most books like this, but poorly edited or something. Multiple times I had to skip back a page to figure out what happened. Author also really likes italics. But one point in its favor is how Catholic Church is represented. A stuffy but enthusiastic force for good in the secret war against vampires.

Are you listening? I kill vampires for money. A lot of it. So don't tell me there ain't no God. I know fucking well there's a God. I just don't understand Him.\"For starters, this book starts off very similar to the John Carpenter movie, but then quickly goes off into an entirely different story. Vampire$ is a beautiful mixture of pure gory horror and bizarre humor. It's like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas meets Dracula.The story takes place in the late 80's/ early 90's. Primarily Texas. Jack Crow leads a team of mercenaries, financed by the Vatican, on a quest to hunt and eliminate vampires. The monsters themselves are near invincible. They're fast, inhumanly strong, and the only real way to kill them is with sunlight. At night, or in the dark of a building, they're almost invincible. Also...no reflections. I really dig that Steakley's vampires cast no reflection. When characters ask how that's possible, the answer is simply that what makes them supernatural is the fact that they defy science.The characters are larger than life, macho, chain-smoking, tough guys, but they're also human. Steakley shows how these characters behave as they do because they all know they will die at their job. They do not doubt it, and Jack Crow is tormented with the knowledge that every single person he recruits will be the best and because they're the best, he's sentencing them to a horrible death. The characters mourn their friends, they cry, they suffer post-traumatic stress, they're caring.The book has its share of flaws, but they are far outweighed by how much fun it is. Steakley will kill characters. He will kill a lot of characters. At first, before you get to know them, you don't really care, but as you get to know them you do care, and then he keeps on killing them. But with the humorous narration and quick-witted characters, you'll be laughing moments before or moments after a gut-wrenching scene, sometimes during.If you enjoy crude humor, serious action, and graphic gore, you'll enjoy Vampire$"}, {"userName": "Gouty", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123218-gouty", "userReview": "It is a pity that one can not give negative stars on Good Reads.

That's how I would describe \"Vampires\" by John Steakley. It didn't take long for Steakley to put the stake right through the heart of this unfocused misadventure into the nightlife of battling the undead. Some strong characters are introduced, but soon become redundant, corny clich\u00e9s of cheesiness and adolescent bravado, taking them to the point where I didn't care about them. There are points when the book becomes exciting, then hits the dust like daylight is rising and it has to get into its coffin before it burns. The entire novel is laboriously written and downright boring is the backstory given to the vampire and his helper. Too quick and rushed is the part given to the head vampire. Out of nowhere is where the character who ends up being the big hero comes from--and without much of a tale to tell. I have to wonder if Steakley has ever read a book before in his life.But, even if all that were forgivable (which it really isn't), the writing is atrocious. It's like this novel was penned by a 6th grader for his English class and never revised or edited and handed in nearly illegible. Numerous spelling and grammatical errors are splattered across this novel. Run-on sentences and repetitious wording tie a noose around its throat; and, all the incorrectly written dialogue, the overuse of the word \"and\" in the place of a comma, and the constant use of \"...\" make reading this book feel like you are having your blood sucked right out of your veins. I give this one a big sundown, as it rose as pale as a vampire and sucked the very will to read out of me. I tried garlic, holy water, and even took the book out into the sunlight to see if it would blaze up, but it didn't. So, as it stood, my OCPD would not allow me to trash this hideous unholy creation and move on to something that might at least appear to be written by someone with a competent grasp of the English language. This is probably the worst novel I have ever read. There is some stiff competition in that category, but this is by far the most poorly written book I've ran eyes across.

This book is the distilled worst of the 1980s.This book is icky. This book is bound with neon-colored spandex and mall hair. The story is inspired by cocaine-fueled nightmares. The soundtrack is a Nitro album. Tipper Gore hated this book.For anyone reading this book now there is a strange feeling of familiarity about the premise, since Joss Weedon used virtually the same set up for Buffy the Vampire Slayer; A group of mortals fated to wage eternal battle against the forces of the undead, sponsored by an ancient order that keeps itself largely removed from the scene themselves. Their own immanent death is so much a part of their lives that they cannot plan for the future, and form intense relationships with their comrades. Where Joss did this story one better is that he removed the hyper-macho stupid of the Vampire$ Inc crew and replaced it with the Scooby Gang. Erased the hard-drinking whoremongers, and filled the gap with teenagers with real human emotions and concerns. Because this is an '80s fantasy novel it has to include a revolting episode of teen masturbatory fodder, but Steakley doesn't go halfway. Steakley happily slaughters whores in the opening pages, but that is just a warm up. Towards the last third of the book, there is one of the most egregious examples of Rape-Her-Until-She-Likes-It in existence. Not only this appalling to read just for the subject, but it is horrific in length and detail. Then this narration of horrors (Steakley seems unaware, btw, that this word can be spelled without a 'w') becomes a romantic episode.

Not that there's anything particularly comfortable about the story --- this is high octane adventure/horror --- but I have regularly enjoyed the experience of reading it.I'm guessing this is (for het males) the equivalent of romance novels for het females. It's a dude's novel, where men bond together fighting impossible odds while cracking jokes and struggling with the immense burdens of responsibility they have shouldered. The women, on the other hand, are there to support the men and be objects of adoration and devotion. It's not a very woke novel. And reading through this time, some of the un-woke nature proved more problematic. In particular, over halfway through we have a long passage telling the story of how one female character became a sex slave to a vampire, and I felt this time through that Steakley was relying far too much on the virgin/whore idealization of women. (And, in general, I don't think the last third of the book lives up to the first two-thirds.)However, the adventure in the first two thirds is some of the most exciting thriller prose I've read, and Steakley wonderfully leavens the action with humor. Moreover, our villains are damn scary vampires. There's nothing like Buffy or Twilight here --- vampires, especially the masters, are pure Evil and compare themselves to gods on earth.

Psyching! Psyching!\"Narration is by the sand and gravel eating narrator of Armor. Excellent choice."}, {"userName": "Siew Ee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6181827-siew-ee", "userReview": "When I read this book, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of \u201cVampires\u201d, a western-horror film directed by John Carpenter in 1998. There are many parallels between book and movie, and for that reason, I enjoyed reading Vampire$, a totally un-Twilight story where you will find blood-sucking monsters which are disgustingly strong, nasty and totally incapable of human feelings of love and compassion. There\u2019s plenty of blood and gore, and the actions scenes are thrilling. Is this book worth 5-stars? Unfortunately not. The book is a little rough around the edges, particularly with the author\u2019s writing style. There were minor incongruities and loopholes, and some of the characters were a little flat. But if you can ignore all these shortcomings, the book makes for a wonderful escape read. So, even though John Steakley\u2019s Vampire$ cannot measure up to John Carpenter\u2019s movie, I think the book is still well worth a go. Exact rating : 3.5."}, {"userName": "Julie Davis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2125014-julie-davis", "userReview": "#61 - 2010.I read this based on Jesse's enthusiastic review. It has an interesting straight-forward style that I imagine does lend itself very well to an audiobook style. I find it compelling though I can't say why ... sort of like picking up a Western that you can't put down for some reason. Not that I really know what that is like. I must say that I appreciate the author's sympathetic look at the pontiff in this. (Yes, you read that right.)I have much, much more to say which is covered in this review.Highly recommended for those who like vampire tales, mercenaries with hearts of gold, Texas, and old-school use of the Catholic Church in fighting Evil. Not necessarily in that order."}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83180-craig", "userReview": "This is a very strange and challenging book, somewhat similar to his other novel, ARMOR, yet in ways vastly different. One confusing point that I didn't understand at all is that the two main characters in both novels have the same names, yet one is a far-future military space opera and the other a contemporary (well, twenty years old now) vampire novel. This one reads by turns like a horror novel, a mens' adventure book, and a study of interpersonal relationships. It's not much at all similar to the John Carpenter movie it inspired, but an interesting and captivating (if not always likable) read."}, {"userName": "Torsten Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4102459-torsten-nelson", "userReview": "Lots of people seem to hate this book on Goodreads. I read it a long time ago, but now I'm reading \"Monster Hunter International\", which is fun, but Vampire$ is way better. The opening act is amazing: read it to learn how intelligent people would hunt vampires - it's not by sneaking around in the dark with big guns. This is not an intellectual book. It's about big men who hunt monsters, and it's fun escapism at its best.They made a movie out of it, but the movie is an abomination, please avoid it."}, {"userName": "Kurt Vosper", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7346080-kurt-vosper", "userReview": "Excellent modern day Vampire Horror novel. They made a movie out of it with James Woods and one of the Baldwin brothers....but the book and movie are drastically different. Basically the hero works in service of the church tracking down vampires and putting an end to them. This book deals with a master vampire appearing and the hero having to take him and his followers out.

Not at all.This is a story about monsters and the men (and women) who hunt them.Steakley tells the tale with great charm, dry wit, and deep characterization.
