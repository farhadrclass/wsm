As problematic as that state's history has been towards a history of people like me, and having produced one side of my family, I was eager to read her writing.I'm not saying that it isn't, in its own way, classic, but I'm not sure if that's simply a product of the bar being set really low for Mississippians in the arts anyway. Her writings evoke scenes and emotions, and she is quite capable of spinning a yarn and detailing facts. It just wasn't anything special to me. Besides the utter rage I felt as she described the white racist's thought process in \"Where Is The Voice Coming From?\", one of her more well-known works. Other than that, not much else."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5501029-megan", "userReview": "These stories have lush descriptions, fully-developed characters, and interesting plot lines. It\u2019s absolute poetry. I wish I hadn't left it at my parents' house."}, {"userName": "John Wiswell", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell", "userReview": "I have yet to read a book with such diversity of prose from a single author. Here are nearly a thousand pages of stories and essays with the incomparable Eudora Welty. Some are funny, some are introspective, some are sharp, some are hateful, some (well, most) are literary - and in so many voices that there is likely no living writer who could duplicate their number or quality, and certainly not both. How she was able to write so convincingly in so many different manners and styles I'll never understand, though nothing could help you understand so well as the essays on her own development that she penned, included towards the end of the book. Every aspiring writer should get this book and study it for its literary content and its storytelling might. Even casual readers should enjoy some of the stories, be it the likes of \"Why I Live at the P.O.,\" detailing the humorous goings-on of a wealthy and ambivalent Southern household, or \"Where Is That Voice Coming From?,\" the chilling first-person account of a racist murderer's work."}, {"userName": "Paul Jellinek", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2942842-paul-jellinek", "userReview": "WOW!! Truly a treasure trove. Interestingly, in a collection of stories that play largely in her native South, my favorite story was \"The Bride of the Innisfallen,\" about a railway journey and ferry crossing from England to Ireland. Go figure."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4423673-paul", "userReview": "Her stories just amaze me, still so many years after they were first written. They paint such a vivid picture of place and time, and of a certain way of life. This is a keeper, to be read and re-read over and over again."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/206031-michelle", "userReview": "I used this book in a course and got a ton of use out of it."}, {"userName": "Danika", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193449-danika", "userReview": "Didn't finish, though at almost 900 pages I didn't care too much.

It was Welty's favorite among her books. The stories of \"The Bride of the Innisfallen and Other Stories\" (1955) are set both in the South and in Europe. Also included are two stories from the 1960s, \"Where Is the Voice Coming From?,\" based on the shooting of Medgar Evers, and \"The Demonstrators.\" A selection of nine literary and personal essays includes evocations of the Jackson of her youth that is essential to her work and cogent discussions of literary form.", "title": "Eudora Welty : Stories, Essays & Memoir", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19922589-eudora-welty", "average": 4.37, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387746569l/19922589.jpg", "reviews": 9, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7973.Eudora_Welty", "name": "Eudora Welty"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7849.Richard_Ford", "name": "Richard Ford"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29926.Michael_Kreyling", "name": "Michael Kreyling"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Short Stories", "Literature", "Classics", "Writing"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19922589-eudora-welty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12580.Eudora_Welty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12577.The_Collected_Stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12585.The_Optimist_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12590.One_Writer_s_Beginnings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12595.Delta_Wedding", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/853371.The_Ponder_Heart"]}
