That Little Something. 1st. New York: Mariner Books, 2008. Print. Charles Simic writes with a passion; he writes of dark irony, and purity in emotion, contradiction and human life. Simic\u2019s eighteenth poem collection That Little Something digs into the human experience with passion and nonchalance that is fresh to the poetic world. At Simic\u2019s best, he incorporates words and ideas in such accuracy and depth that to take a step back from his work creates a new and vivid understanding of life. At his worst, some of his poetry seems contrived as well as repetitive.That Little Something fills the reader with notions of imagination mixed with the realistic themes of life, necessary for relation. The title poem \u201cThat Little Something\u201d questions motives, asking the reader to look more closely upon their reasoning, their life and even accept the possibility that yes, maybe we have all been \u201cmaking it up\u201d (our reasoning, our motives) but even then, we still find ourselves searching for the inevitably unanswerable or lost. It is this idea that Simic comes back to continually through the stretch of his work. His work brings out the unavoidable truth in life, the overlooked passions and heroes of yesterday, reality stricken and now matters of the past that \u201cno one recalls\u201d, the constant wars and battles both internal and external that plague our cities and selves, as well as the beauty in life, forgotten by our constant revolutions, only found in silence, and apparent when we are able to remove ourselves from the deafening cries of our own existence. Simic\u2019s poetry within That Little Something, though well written and mainly consistent in awing and amazing his readers, seems to stick to the same subjects consistently throughout the book, and when veering from these subjects lacks substance and even reason. Broken up into four sections, Simic\u2019s work holds the expectation of variety, enticing his readers and regrettably letting them down. Section I deals with a more inward focused theme, invisibility of self to the world, and the comfort in the loss of self rather than embracement of it. Section II continues this theme while incorporating the ideas of fighting and war, burning and shadows into the mix \u2013 again falling invisible to the crowd but this time in the midst of the tragic. Section III again supports these ideas but holds a different tone as Simic seems to be calling to his reader for reaction, for a voice, while Section IV fades into the back ground again, structurally with untitled poems, and aesthetically as the pieces reads as mere fragments and blurs of previously stated passions. Simic\u2019s subject matter throughout the individual poems can also be finicky. The problem lies in the works that seem unnecessary; though in quantity the themes of his poems are generally awe inspiring, the reality is that all aren\u2019t. In side by side comparison some fail miserably in meaning, while other soar to the ranks of creative genius.  Taken as a whole That Little Something fulfills its pre-written expectations of \u201cpurity\u201d in emotion and passion in human-kinds \u201ccontradictory but simultaneous states of being and feeling\u201d; Simic brings to life what is lost from our busy society and war-driven world, while realistically portraying the contrasting emotions we all feel and have felt. His work embraces reality with a depth common to poetry, but uncommon within the subject matter he chooses. Even in his weaker or unnecessary poems there is a reality that is fresh, honest and sincere. Simic\u2019s ability to acknowledge and purposefully create consistent and authentic works that continually inspire thought and passion in his readers is a task that is refreshing in modern poetry, a task that all writers should learn and equally master."}, {"userName": "Jennn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1457386-jennn", "userReview": "Unfortunately I didn\u2019t enjoy this book as much as I thought I would when I was thumbing through it. The length of each poem is good and it reads easy enough, but the gems for me were few and far between. It felt like there were boundaries around each poem and even though he would sometimes stick a toe out, he would remain inside where it was safe and publishable. That is, he\u2019s a good poet and I could see how he would fit right into the writing community, but to me, that\u2019s not enough. I like to see poets leap into the fire, and jump out of their secure and dependable margins that are a sure \u201cshoe-in\u201d for awards and publications. I want there to be something at risk. Poetry is such an emotional experience, I want to be moved.Many of his poems were nostalgic and reflective. \u201cWalking\u201d kicked off the book and was thoughtful. \u201cThe Elevator is Out of Order\u201d continues the pace, but with a surprising dash of sexuality: \u201cThe one who let you feel her breasts/Vanished upstairs. The name is not familiar,/But the scratches of her nails are.\u201d I really liked the end of \u201cDramatic Evenings\u201d (one of the best poems, I thought): \u201cAnd watch the flakes come down/Languidly, one at a time,/On the broken bird feeder and the old dog\u2019s grave.\u201d \u201cDevil and Eve\u201d was quite clever. I really loved \u201cImpersonator of Blank Walls\u201d: \u201cIn school you liked erasers/More than you did pencils\u201d \u2013 the whole thing was pretty brilliant. \u201cListen\u201d was dark, but captivating: \u201cOne can hear a fire engine/In the distance,/But not the cries for help\u201d. \u201cTo the Reader\u201d made me smile and was another clever one.Sometimes I thought his poems were a bit pretentious, which is, perhaps, why his book is a whopping $23 instead of the usual $15 or $7 (it was hard cover, but still, for 73 pages, I find that pretty expensive). Some lines that struck me as such include: \u201cWine had bloodied your lips and tongue\u201d, \u201cThe stars were lit like candles\u201d (Wonders of the Invisible World), \u201cBring a whiff of freshly cut roses//And the sight of men in black/In a hurry to lower the heavy coffin/So it can ride Satan\u2019s luxury train\u201d (Come Winter), \u201cThat sleepwalking waiter/Carrying plates of burgers and fries,/Is he coming to our table,/Or is he going to walk out of this place?/He\u2019s going to walk out\u201d (The Late Game), \u201cThe season of fabulous feasts is coming./Mouthwatering dishes of new evils/Are on the way to your table\u201d (Gourmets of Tragedies).Bottomline: Some gems, but not my style."}, {"userName": "Ashraf Ali", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2015", "userURL":

When they hit me, Simic's poems have an x-ray-like precision (that is, a kind of powerful observation that is still mysterious around the edges) - yesterday, the focus was lacking. The fault is mine as the reader, not Simic's as a writer.Having said that, one or two still slipped through. 'Impersonator of Blank Walls' reminds me so strongly of two boys - men, I guess - that I know. I could imagine both of them telling me these stories. Even as a child you sought to be invisible.When it was time for dinner,You went and hid under the bedAnd let them search for you everywhere.In school you liked erasersMore than you did pencils.Empty rooms at dusk meant more to youThan going to the movies.Your date waited for you in the park,While you sat in your kitchenCutting your head and neckOut of old family photographs,Giving yourself again the appearanceYou had on snowy evenings,Coming home to your parentsWith your hair and eyebrows all white.'Wire Hangers' slipped through because it's so prosaic yet so evocative. All they needIs one little red dressTo start swayingIn that empty closetFor the rest of themTo nudge each other,Clicking like knitting needlesOr disapproving tongues.It's such a small step from there to the scarlet-clad girl sashaying down the street while the old biddies cluck and flap. And the girl, hearing them, is not in the least ashamed, but instead takes their chatter and rolls it into the rhythm of her hips. She's a hot spot in a grey world and she doesn't care who knows it.And then. 'Eternity's Orphans'. This one ... this one. I have a friend who is a painter. He used to paint these longing, yearning pictures of dream women. Then he was told that this was inappropriate. So he painted longing, yearning paintings of cats and birds and dogs. And it sounds funny, but it's not. He took all that wanting, all the quiet, long-held desire, and he kept on whispering it out in his paintings, and it was all there if you could see it. If you wanted to see it. We all read ourselves into things. Whether it's a grey cat with green eyes who stands in for the love of your life or a poem about a single, reckless, perfect act, we walk through a world that is what we make of it.'Eternity's Orphans'One night you and I were walking.The moon was so brightWe could see the path under the trees.Then the clouds came and hid itSo we had to grope our wayTill we felt the sand under our bare feet,And heard the pounding waves.Do you remember telling me,\u2018Everything outside this moment is a lie\u2019?We were undressing in the darkRight at the water\u2019s edgeWhen I slipped the watch off my wristAnd without being seen or sayingAnything in reply, I threw it into the sea."}, {"userName": "Jamison", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1137364-jamison", "userReview": "If this was my first reading of a book by Simic I'd have given it four stars, there are some truly well crafted poems in here. Unfortunately, I've read enough of his books to have grown sick of words like eternity and invisible that give an occult feel to poor-house culture. My favorite poem in this entire book is also the only prose poem in it; in \"Late-Night Chat\" he breaks his form in a really exciting way only to immediately return to what he's comfortable with and great at. But it's like an incredible magic trick. You can watch it the first 10 times without losing your sense of amazement, but if you keep watching your interest will eventually slip. Simic's amazing at what he does and he's delivered one incredible collection after the other but when I see a poem like \"Late-Night Chat\" (which combines the best elements of his poems with the best elements of work in Dime Store Alchemy and The World Doesn't End) I get my hopes up for something new. If that something new is a fluke, then I've gotten excited over nothing. After all my griping I'm still more than happy to pick up any of his books and let myself be thrilled over his ability to present a quick image that tells an epic story through what it implies. And as a plus, this is one of his more violent books."}, {"userName": "Robert Beveridge", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/766524-robert-beveridge", "userReview": "Charles Simic, That Little Something (Harcourt, 2008)Charles Simic is stepping down from the post of Poet Laureate a year early because, he says, being Poet Laureate keeps him away from doing what he loves best-- writing poetry. And honestly, as much as I like seeing Simic, unarguably one of America's best living poets, in such a position, anything that gets him to be more prolific is perfectly fine with me.I have to say that Simic's distraction is noticeable in some of these poems, but really, when Simic brings his A game to the table, he's still matchless:\"The two of us just barely visible,Ghostlike looking from high upAt the wet cobblestones,The one pigeon who appeared hurt,Who wanted to be somewhere elseAnd did his best to get there,Limping badly and stopping to rest.\"(\"One Wing of the Museum\")It's getting kind of boring saying \"another winner from Charles Simic,\" but I'll put up with the boredom as long as Simic keeps turning out my favorite books of any given year.

However, Simic summed up the little things in life well, even if there were a decent amount of poems that didn't describe little things, but big things in a little way; this bugged me while I was in a good mood, irritated when I wasn't. This was the purpose, turns out, but I don't like how the two contrasted. I wanted either one or the other, depending on the circumstance of reading, not both. But overall, her gets a good score, I guess. I'll give it a 4 instead of 3 because I can perform a few of these poems along with this year's speech piece.

Simic is a writer who I keep making notes to myself to read. All of his work that I have seen anthologized or in magazines has really struck and stuck with me, but this collection had none of that. By the end of the book, just about every poem felt like it was dwelling on the whole idea of writing being a conversation \"Late Night Chat\" and \"To the Reader\" I found particularly offputting in this regard. Every subject seemed so tame. All of the sex was impotent.

Re-reading the same line to try and understand the point was not a labor of love."}, {"userName": "Roy Kesey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21362043-roy-kesey", "userReview": "The first two-thirds is more of that excellent thing Simic does so well\u2014simplified weirdness wedded to high insight. Poem after poem of this. Then it started to thin out a little, and by the fourth section I was getting few of my favorite flavors. To be clear, though: middle-drawer Simic would go in almost anyone else's top drawer."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/960848-amy", "userReview": "This book is amazing in how it manages to fit so much into such small poems.

Charles Simic is such a discovery for me. I didn't like all the poems, but it takes only a few to inspire awe and gratitude.
