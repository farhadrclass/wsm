But I still enjoyed the book! I'm a mom now, so I \"get\" it a lot more than I did before. I'm even a blogger, so I connect with Ally there too. It was a fun read for me as I primarily read it in the evenings, after my 18 month old son went to sleep (that I stay home with during the day.) It made me smile, laugh and roll my eyes in all of the right places."}, {"userName": "Amy Bradsher", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8690471-amy-bradsher", "userReview": "Every single mom needs this message. We all struggle with comparison, with self-worth issues, and wonder if we're doing anything right. We go through stages of sleeplessness, of stress, and loneliness. Whether your a stay-at-home mom, a working mom, a young or older mom, or whether your kids are little and busy or big and complicated, Mom's Night Out has something for you.I'm generally leery of movies that are books and vice versa. Usually one is drastically better than the other, and that makes for a big disappointment somewhere. The great thing about this book is that 1) Tricia Goyer wrote it, and she's a fantastic writer, and 2) it is EVERY BIT as good as the movie and then some. I read the book first, and with this particular set, I don't think it would have mattered. Because it isn't your typical book but a novelization, the two are very, very similar. Goyer actually watched the movie over and over to put it on paper accurately, and she did an amazing job. The book flows smoothly with one scene falling into place right after another, and it captures what's happening on screen perfectly. Exactly.With one exception, and in this instance the book most definitely rules. One of the main mom characters speaks much less than the others. One is clearly the main, with the other two being important supporting roles, and they each have a lot to offer. There is little background on what might be motivating one or happening in her head; but the book delves into the motivations of the other. I loved that extra information. It's perfect. It's necessary. It's something that we all face, to some degree or another, and Goyer blended Patricia Heaton's facial expressions and the tidbits of information from the script with reality to really round out this person.These deep lessons don't make the book dry, though. I started it at a baseball game one evening and was reading on the couch with my husband afterwards. By the end I was laughing so hard I nearly fell off! My son - who's seven - decided that anything that funny needed to be read by him, as well, so he's been carrying it around for a few weeks. It's definitely a keeper.Why is it so funny? Do you remember that '80s movie Adventures in Babysitting? They could've named this book Adventures in Mommydom and it would've been perfect - except that unlike that older movie, in this one they learn from all the things that go wrong and see that there really is beauty in life's struggles and imperfections.And that sometimes God put them there. Other times He uses them.Either way, our mess doesn't have to cause us stress. We could choose to laugh and see the joy and beauty in our adventures. Then we could band together for a mom's night out to laugh about them.Wouldn't that be fun?I received a free copy of these books from LitFuse Publicity in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Stephanie (the nerdy princess)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16046116-stephanie-the-nerdy-princess", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review This was a very enjoyable read. Very funny and very relatable if you are a parent. I honestly thought It was going to be funnier\u2026. But it was still a good story. I think the movie is probably better but I have yet to watch that. Allyson is a mommy-blogger with not a lot of followers yet, but hoping it will, mother of 3. She is a stay at home mom, and loves it and this is what she has always wanted. She has some type of phobia about messes and with 3 children she is always struggling to remain calm even though there is a mess somewhere. She seems to have to fix everything, and my favorite part of the book with her is when she has a meltdown, grabs a bag of chocolate and hides in her closet\u2026. WIN! That\u2019s where I would go to if I wanted to hide from my children! The next character we are introduced to is Sandra. She is the pastor\u2019s wife with a teenage daughter. She is always trying to be perfect and set a great example since everyone is looking up to her and using her as an example. It must be hard being everyone\u2019s rock when you have nobody to be your rock\u2026.Last but not least we met Izzy. Proud mother of twins with a husband who is scared crapless of little kids. She is always afraid to leave them alone with him because he just cant handle it.With all 3 moms stressed out, Allyson decides to have a \u201cmom\u2019s night out\u201d she got a groupon and it is going to happen. The husband has all agreed to watch the children with a promise of not calling the women.Well sure enough, all hell breaks loose and allyson\u2019s wonderful night turns into something else.

For the record, I have been wanting to see it, and, at this point, I'll just have to catch it when it comes out (which will be soon). If the movie is as great as this book, then I cannot wait to see it! Tricia Goyer did a fantastic job in turning this into a must-read book :)I am not a mama, but I could totally relate to Allyson. How many times have I honestly felt like she did and questioned my own self at times? Sondra, the pastor's wife, was another character I could relate to in some ways. She always felt like she had to stay \"on\" and I don't say that in a bad way. Just in an \"always-having-to-keep-appearances-don't-let-them-see-the-real-me-at-times-because-they'd-hate-or-judge-her\" persona way.

I said that I really wanted to see the movie Mom\u2019s Night Out. I had read the novelization a few weeks back, written by Tricia Goyer and thought it would be a great movie. I laughed out-loud and got choked up in parts. I wondered if they could pull off the fun and craziness I had read about in the book and put it on the big screen. I told my kids about the actors that were in this movie. They didn't seem thrilled. In unison the said, \u201cHow about watching the new Spiderman movie or there is this other movie\u2026 Mom\u2019s Night out really?\u201dI told them the movie depicted the joys and struggles of motherhood. It could be a wild ride of family fun. No one looked thrilled to see it. But because I asked them. We went as a family. A mom couldn't ask for more! I told them of all the cast members (listed below) hoping this would real them in. Nobody changed their expressions. They just gave me polite smiles, saying inside, \u201cOK, Mom I\u2019m doing this for you because I love you. You can\u2019t change my mind. Just go with it.\u201d So, I did. I knew what lay ahead. I was excited about my Mom\u2019s Night Out! Grin!The MOMS\u2019 NIGHT OUT film featured \u2013 CAST - Sarah Drew (Grey\u2019s Anatomy), Sean Astin (THE LORD OF THE RINGS), Patricia Heaton (Everybody Loves Raymond, The Middle), Alex Kendrick (COURAGEOUS), Robert Amaya (COURAGEOUS), Andrea Logan White (REVELATION ROAD), Kevin Downes (COURAGEOUS), and platinum-selling country recording artist Trace Adkins (THE LINCOLN LAWYER).The movie starts out exactly as the book did. Allyson is up early her husband is away on business, she\u2019s feeling stressed and she begins to blog.\u201cIt\u2019s 5a.m. And do you know where your children are? Mine are in bed. I should be in bed. It\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. But I\u2019m not. Wanna know why? Because I\u2019m a clean freak! \u2026\u2026I can actually feel the house getting dirty. Like I have nerve endings in the carpet. And it affects me.\u201dAs we watched the first few scenes of the move I heard the audience roar and I watched my children on either side of me laughing hard. As I looked at them and watched the movie I remembered being in the thick of raising small children. Those times were precious and overwhelming at the same time. The movie showed that. The Lord brought me through along with girlfriends and prayer.I looked over at my oldest son who is graduating from high school next week who was actually enjoying the movie and I stared at him. I couldn't believe he had grown up so fast and would be off to college soon. I looked at my daughter who was in the thick of raising a precious 3 \u00bd year old son with her husband. She laughed but saw this movie in a different way than my son. I saw in her eyes she was relieved that other women had gone through the things she had. I saw her being energized. My 16 year old son laughed even though doing so hurt. He wasn't feeling well but came anyway to be with us. I appreciated him doing that even though he had a stuffy nose. I looked at him almost a man. He\u2019s\u2019 always be my baby!After the movie ended the credits came and we usually stay to read them all. Everyone was relieved when they read in the credits that nothing happened to the bird named Mama! We roared even more at the thought of it. It reminded us of the whole bird scene. Hilarious! SPOILER ALERT: There was a part that touched me in the book but more so in the movie when Bones was talking to Allyson about motherhood. \u201cI saw something the other day\u2026It was an eagle just caring for its young\u2026.It\u2019s a beautiful thing to watch one of God\u2019s creations just doing what it was made to do\u2026Just being an eagle, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d He looked at Allyson.\u201cLemme tell you something, girl. I doubt the Good Lord made a mistake giving your kiddos the mama He did. So just be\u2026you. He\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d\u2026hearing this from Bones tugged at her heart even more. He was an unlikely prophet, sent to speak to her at an unlikely time. Only God could do something like that. Allyson wiped away a tear, sniffling as she did. \u201cThat was really\u2026profound, Bones.\u201d\u201cWhat? Wha\u2019d I say? Was it good? He straightened in his seat.\u2026\u201dWhere they true, Bone\u2019s words? Was she enough? Had God made her enough just as she was? Was she enough just in being who she was\u2026no matter how well she performed?\u201d (Quotes taken from the Book by the same name written by Tricia Goyer \u2013 this scene was in the movie)I know I struggle to walk in what God has called me to do and not be swayed to perform to the standards of this world. I walked away encouraged. The message I heard was that being a Mom matters so does balance and being a team with your spouse. Everyone needs a time out and time to unplug, regroup and breathe before going back at it.It was wonderful to see I could go to the theatres and have a choice at watching this great quality of a movie with clean fun, laughs and a great message. I LOVED IT! And so did my kids. They were talking about their favorite parts in the car on the way home. Laughing again at what they had seen and heard. Great memories created on this Mother\u2019s Day! HAPPY MOTHER\u2019S DAY EVERYONE!!

It's pure fun to read about a group of women out to wrangle some girl time while their husbands and guy friends take over on the home front. The theme isn't a new one, but for me, fresh and read-worthy all the same. The results of such an arrangement? Two sets of side-splitting hilarious fast-paced adventures, a comedy of errors, updated, but which never grows old. Find out what a biker gang, a buttoned-down pastor's wife, a man-child addicted to video games, a stressed teen Mom, a tattoo parlor, and a crazy bowling alley all have in common. Allyson is a mom who loves her kids and loves her life, yet wonders why she's not happy. Her \"moments\" have been way too frequent. Sondra is a pastor's wife who does her best to hold everything together at church and at home, but she's putting on a show. Her beautiful teen, Zoe, is forcing her to face old nightmares. Bridget has had to grow up too quickly for her liking, and she's struggling to find a balance and maturity at the same time with a child in tow. Izzy is faced with an unplanned pregnancy while her husband is freaking out with the twins they already have. Dealing with a disappointing night out these women had been looking forward to a long time, however, was nothing when they all discovered baby Phoenix has gone missing. Now, they are on a mission. I remember those days being a mom of little ones. And unfortunately I also remember the Mom moments tucked between the great memories. So I have a lot of empathy for the set-up in this scenario. Nights out are something we would live for, strive for, and yearn over. Life with small children is an unforgettable era in our lives. Parents look back on those early days with a mixture of feelings. The author of the book works this into the story so well. We laugh and poke fun at times when things went completely wrong. It's a strong premise for a book like this. I consider this book at the top of my list for funny adventures. Second, there are some terrific teachable moments in this story line. For example, it's not unusual to feel like a failure as Mom, especially when there's pressure from so many directions in the family's life. We tend to focus on what to do to fix the problems we see around us, but it isn't always something we need to do so much as something we need to perceive. We can't always control the circumstances around us, but we can change how we view ourselves and the circumstances. This book is filled with examples of that principle. The book and the movie are not preachy, but both are filled with great humor that doesn't depend of crudity or foul language to be funny. Underneath the humor are some terrific themes, some lessons we can all learn from and plenty of fun. I believe it will appeal to a wide range of readers, not just women or Moms. I highly recommend it for all age groups and interests. Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary review copy of this book from Netgalley on behalf of B&H Publishing.

The moment I began the book the laughter burst forth! As I kept progressing through the tale, the laughs just kept coming as I could relate to the way a young mom feels when overwhelmed and feeling a loss of identity. One of my biggest thumbs up for this book is the truth it reveals in each of the main three women\u2019s lives.One is a stay-at-home mom with three very young children. Her husband travels constantly as part of his job requirements. Another is a pastor\u2019s wife whose daughter is in her teen years. She feels the pressure of always having an \u201cI\u2019ve got it together\u201d look and being available to listen to others problems. Finally there is a young mom with twins who finds out she is pregnant again, and her husband can\u2019t seem to handle easy care taking tasks of the two children she has now.A night out for these three moms is arranged; their plan is to go out to a very nice restaurant, have a meal without cutting up someone else\u2019s food or having to be concerned for their babies for just one meal. Seems simple enough don\u2019t you think? From there, the adventure, laughs and truth each woman needs to know about themselves, their faith and more is revealed in some hilarious situations. At one point in my reading I came to a sober reminder that not all of what we think of others or ourselves may be true; it is when we spend time with each other that our hearts can become known. While that can be frightening, it can also be freeing. The night doesn\u2019t go as planned, but God\u2019s hand is in it all along. The preconceived ideas are replaced by who each woman really is. Their friendship deepens more as well as their love for each other.I can\u2019t say what might impress you or cause you to burst out laughing, but you will laugh! I found encouragement as one husband tells his wife that her job is important and with that profound statement the impact made on the character\u2019s heart. Each Mother\u2019s Day for me is special as my husband and sons make sure I enjoy the day and know just how much I am loved and appreciated. You are loved and dear to God first and hopefully you have some people around you that encourage you as a woman, along with all the other hats you may wear! Read the book for yourself and give a copy to someone whom you know will appreciate the truths and laughter written in the pages.My rating is 5 stars.Amazon Link: http://www.amazon.com/Moms-Night-Out-...Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

Initially, I found myself trying to be as partial as possible, while reading the book and not let myself get \"drawn into the hype\" that surrounded the book, but as I got deeper into reading the book and wiping away the tears from both the laughter and \"I've been there\" feelings, this is such a breathe of fresh air for moms who do it all and don't get the breaks.The devotional companion that comes with this by Kerri Pomarolli is a must have to go along with not just the book but if you, like me, are waiting for either that mythical opportunity to go to a an actual movie or waiting for it this movie to come out on dvd or Netflix, its well worth having on hand.Each of the characters seem to represent not just the \"sterotypical images\" that society may have of mom, but the images that moms have of ourselves and often make ourselves tired trying to live out.As one of the supporting characters, Bones so perfectly shares in his biker way:\"Bones: It\u2019s beautiful to watch one of God\u2019s creations just doing what it was made to do. Ya\u2019ll spend so much time beating yourselves up. I doubt the good Lord made a mistake giving your kiddos the mom he did. \"We do tend to be harder on ourselves don't we and having things like Pinterest, blogs and Facebook doesn't seem to make it easier to feel lifted up but rather feel more defeated.If the movie is anything like this book was, I for one am excited to see it because even for a fictional tale of a night gone wrong, \"Mom's Night Out\" captures the insecurity, the love, the joy and the absolute chaos of motherhood\".I was both laughing and crying throughout the book and it capture all sides of being a mom that we sometimes seem to forget while we're just trying to make it to the end of the day and get ready for the next morning.Tricia really help bring the characters alive and if you haven't seen the movie yet, I imagine you can capture the same feeling that others are experiencing as they are able to get the time to go out and see the movie, but the book, \"Mom's Night Out\" helps bring that experience home right now to the tired and busy moms who are just happy to plop into bed after navigating crayon drawings on the wall and legos all over the floor.The book (and I am only guessing the movie does, from hearing from friends who have had the opportunity to have a Mom's Night Out to actually go to a movie theater) seems to capture what being a mom is about and what being a mom is really about and makes this novelization something to not only recommend with your mommy friends but to engage in reading oneself.At the end, there is a one page book discussion that makes not only a fun \"conversation\" starter if you are coming back from watching the movie, but makes this a fun book study for the moms in your life.So if you haven't seen the movie yet, definitely take the time to read the book."}, {"userName": "Tricia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45706980-tricia", "userReview": "What do you get when you mix a tattoo parlor, a police station, a biker gang, a tazer and multiple nervous breakdowns? Why it\u2019s just a normal mom\u2019s night out!If you are looking for a nice relaxing book about a mom having a good time with her friends away from the kids this is not the book for you. Mom\u2019s Night Out by Tricia Goyer will make you laugh and cry with all the characters because no matter what stage of your life you may be in you can relate to every emotion and stress filled moment. Allyson is a stay at home mom in her 30\u2019s whose husband is away on business a lot causing her to raise their three kids on her own. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough Allyson\u2019s constant fear of germs and things being out of place often causes more stress on both her and her children. All she ever wanted was to be a stay at home mom and while she has everything that she wanted she is unhappy. Sondra is the Pastors wife who prides herself in being polished and very conservative. This can be very hard when you have a 16 year old daughter. She is the glue that holds not only the church but the ladies in it together. Izzy has been Allyson\u2019s best friend since grade school with twin boys of her own and a husband who is terrified of children she often is the ring leader. So when she comes up with the idea that the three ladies need a much needed Mom\u2019s night out to distress everyone agrees. The women put the dads in charge of the kids and head out. What could go wrong? A relaxing dinner with no little ones or spit up at a fancy restaurant turns into a wild goose chase across the city. Between looking for a lost baby in a tattoo parlor, ending up in jail and involving the help of a biker gang; it seems as if the night has been a horrible disaster. Throw in a case of mistaken identity, a $484 cab fee and disapproving members of the church and the night is anything but relaxing. Allyson starts to believe all hope is lost and that she will never be a good mother when she finds answers to her problems in the unlikeliest place. While not everyone struggles from the same problems as the women in the story at one point or another we have all been so stressed to the point of a break down. That\u2019s what makes this story so great. Finding out that life is about the journey and the small moments not just the perfect ones. Sometimes the answers to our problems can be found during the most stressful times of our life. All we can do is try our best and be our-self because it is the only thing we are meant to do. And never forget that sometimes the best advice comes from a biker tattoo artist!"}, {"userName": "Jalynn Patterson", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8725733-jalynn-patterson", "userReview": "About the Book:Moms' Night Out is a novelization of the hilarious family comedy that celebrates real family life\u2014where everything can go wrong and still turn out all right.All Allyson and her friends want is a peaceful, grown-up evening of dinner and conversation . . . a long-needed moms\u2019 night out.

About the Author:TRICIA GOYER is the award-winning author of more than forty books, drawn from her experiences as a teen mother and leading voice of hope for women in today\u2019s generation. A key note speaker at the 2013 MOPS convention, Tricia writes regularly for several popular Christian women's blogs in addition to her own. She has been married for more than twenty years and is the mother of six children. For more information, visit: www.triciagoyer.com.My Review: I have been married for quite awhile, it will be 20 years this October, and even I know that if I leave my children with my husband I will literally get a phone call every 15 minutes. Not because there is a problem, just because my poor husband has had enough and is ready to hand over the reigns. This book is very funny and mothers from every walk of life can relate to the characters in the book. I'm sure after reading it, that we would all agree that there is at least one page that is directly out of our busy, everyday lives.  We as mother's know the tremendous things we have to go through just to get a break from it all, and this book shows what a group of moms had to go through just to go out for some relaxing time away. It wasn't such an easy feat to pull off. And we get to share in the joys, mishaps, and misunderstood happenings that we as mothers often engage in whether it is knowingly or totally by accident. I resonate with Allyson very much, I understand the whole Bruce Banner/Hulk mood that she is able to morph into. I have done it, not often but some. It's nice to finally have a book that resonates more with a majority of us moms. It also feels great knowing that we are not alone. **Disclosure** This book was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from Litfuse Publicity."}, {"userName": "Amy H", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16041290-amy-h", "userReview": "I got this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.OMG THIS BOOK!!!

Mom\u2019s Night Out is an endearing, true-to-life comedy.Moms\u2019 Night Out is a novelization of the hilarious family comedy that celebrates real family life\u2014where everything can go wrong and still turn out all right.If you have not seen the movie then you are doing yourself a disservice. Not only is the movie truly funny but it is also very real, which helps bring out the humor. Tricia Goyer has taken the screenplay written by Andrea Nasfell and Jon Erwin and transformed it into a novel which is no easy task. This is a story about three stressed out ladies who also happen to be mothers. All they want is a few hours away from the home so that they can go to dinner and enjoy each others company and friendship. After all it is just a few hours, they won\u2019t be very far away and they will have their cell phones. Ms. Goyer has enhanced the story, added scenes as well as brought real life to all the characters. \u201cMom\u2019s Night Out\u201d is all about family and the things that family members do when there is need. You will wish this book never ends because you will fall in love with each character. Ms. Goyer has done it again.

I read so much that sometimes it's hard for me to remember all the different authors but she's written so many books that I've read and loved; I know if it has her name on it, it's a 'must read' for me!I read this book while stuck at home for the weekend with sick kids. As I sat in my same pj's for two days with unwashed hair and a filthy house and cleaned up after puking kids, I so related to Allison's character in the story! I also have three kids and a husband that's gone all the time for work. Moms Night out is a pretty foreign concept to me. What? Go out of the house WITHOUT the kids? Well after reading this, I'm not so sure I want to!Allyson finally gets a night out with gal pals Izzy and the Pastor's wife Sondra. I also felt very connected to Sondra's character and her daughter Zoe. As a Pastor's daughter, I grew up with the higher expectations, comparisons and standards I had to live up to and saw my mom go through the same. I felt connected to all of these women in one way or another.Anyway, back to the story! Allyson's night out does not go according to plan AT ALL! Starting with a mix-up over reservations, things go from bad to worse. After a run in with her sister-in-law's ex which leads to some major drama and a missing baby, things start to get a little crazy!I could tell this was based on a movie because the majority of it takes place in one night, which regular novel's never do. It was like reading a movie if that makes sense. I almost feel like I don't need to see it anymore because I feel like I already watched it!I enjoyed the situational comedy and all of the crazy antics and silly characters like Bones. It was a little bit too much in the ridiculous scenarios that would never really happen. I feel like the first half was pretty true to a mom's life but then it went a little too far with the tattoo parlor, missing baby and ensuing drama. Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed the book. But I feel like being based on a movie contributed to some of the far fetched action.I'm curious to see Mom's Night Out so I probably will eventually. This was a fun, easy read that moms everywhere are going to nod their heads and agree with (the first half anyway)."}, {"userName": "Edythe Hamilton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27917242-edythe-hamilton", "userReview": "Allyson is a super clean freak, mommy, and blogger whom now is having trouble beginning a post for her blog.

The book is a true to life look at the struggles and triumphs as a Mom we all feel. Allyson just wants a night out with her friends to go to a grown up restaurant to enjoy grown up company so she gets a GroupOn coupon and enlists the help of her husband to make it happen, someone has to watch the children. No one is prepared for the kind of night these families have including a missing child, a motorcycle gang from a tattoo parlor, and ending up at the police station. Tricia Goyer's novelization of this movie is fantastic. I personally haven't seen the movie yet because I wanted to read the book first before seeing it. Mom's Night Out is a laugh out loud, keep your tissues close kind of book. As a Mom, I found myself relating to these women in almost all situations except I don't have twins. I loved all the characters in this story especially Bones, who is not what he seems. He is a big guy who is part of a motorcycle gang and owns a tattoo parlor. He does whatever he can to help the Moms in their search for a missing child and the husbands. Bones really gives of himself and definitely surprises Allyson. Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. I spent much of my time laughing out loud and shaking my head as events unfolding were so familiar. I did also find myself crying in places where I could completely relate to feelings of being overwhelmed and undeserving of what I have with my family. This book really captures motherhood, parenting, and friendship. I truly enjoyed this book and highly recommend this book to anyone who reads Christian Fiction. You won't be disappointed! I give this book 5 STARS.I received this book from Litfuse Publicity for no charge in exchange for my honest review of this book."}, {"userName": "Beckie Burnham", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2952739-beckie-burnham", "userReview": "I think it must be really hard to write a novelization of a movie. After all, film is all visual, giving the viewer what you want him to see. Books allow the reader to add his/her own imagination to the story. I have not seen Mom\u2019s Night Out, the movie, but I did read Tricia Goyer\u2019s novelization by the same name, and I think she did a great job with it. Filled with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and some great aha moments, the story follows 3 friends and mothers looking to unplug from their busy lives. What ensues is definitely not what they expected, but perhaps it was what they needed.Allyson is a mommy-blogger wannabe who feels the need to fix everything around her. Phobic about messes she is surrounded by them. Sondra is a pastor\u2019s wife who feels the need to be perfect even if it means shutting down who she really is. Izzy is a mom dealing with a husband who doesn\u2019t have a clue what to do with his twin children. All need a quiet night out to connect and relax. What they get is a missing child, a snooty restaurant hostess, and a biker/tattoo artist, among other things. There is non-stop action, plenty of noise and revelations of who they just might be in Christ.I liked Mom\u2019s Night Out. While my kids are past the baby and teenage stages, I could really relate to the women who are all things to all people, except themselves. For all the busyness, craziness and mayhem that accompanies life, the message that God has it all in His very capable and loving hands is clearly articulated. I recommend this book to all who have or haven\u2019t seen the movie.

From the opening lines it captures the crazy chaos we call motherhood to a tee. The character of Allyson embodies most of us as she struggles through the wash, rinse, repeat cycle of raising children.At one point in the story Allyson reveals that her dream when she grew up was to be a wife and mother. Now that the dream has come true, reality has inched in to upset the fairy tale. It seems that no matter what direction she turns she is surrounded by her short comings. The house is a mess, the kids are a mess, and above all else she's a mess. She spends a lot of time wondering how \"they\" do it. You know who \"they\" are . . . those \"other\" mothers. The ones that have the perfect house, perfect kids, and the always put-together perfect look.Through a divinely inspired and desperately needed moms' night out, Allyson's eyes are slowly opened to the fact that her life and all that it encompasses may be a mess but it is a truly beautiful mess.I must admit that I'm a little hesitant to read a book after seeing the movie. I'm usually disappointed in one or the other. I'm pleased to say in this instance that isn't the case at all. I loved them both equally and came away from the reading with the same feeling of gratitude that I did from the movie. I'm humbled, honored and grateful that God chose me to mother.If you are looking for a funny, uplifting, and inspiring story to read for yourself or to give to a friend, you can't go wrong with Moms' Night Out.
