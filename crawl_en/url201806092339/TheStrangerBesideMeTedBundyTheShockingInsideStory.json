I don\u2019t feel particularly embarrassed or resentful about that. I was one of many, all of us intelligent, compassionate people who had no real comprehension of what possessed him, what drove him obsessively.\u201d \nWould you trust this man?Comparisons could be made between Lois Lane and the writer Ann Rule. She was caught in the middle of a bizarre set of circumstances that was quickly becoming a nightmare. Someone she considered a friend was being accused of things that she simply could not comprehend. Even with her years of work in law enforcement, she still had trouble believing what was being said about Ted Bundy. I was a bit surprised to read that she was not embarrassed that she had been so fooled. If Dr. Spock is right, maybe something on a more subconscious level was keeping her from accepting the truth. \u201cDr. Benjamin Spock, who worked in a veterans\u2019 hospital dealing with emotional illnesses during World War II, commented at the time that there was a pronounced cross-sex problem in dealing with psychopathic personalities. The male psychopaths had no difficulty in bewitching female staff members, while the male staff picked up on them rapidly. The female psychopaths could fool the male staff but not the women.\u201d Rule worked with Ted Bundy at the crisis center in Seattle, answering the calls of those in desperate need of help. Knowing what we know now about Bundy, I wonder if he didn\u2019t work there just to feed on the pain of others. He made an impression on Rule, just like he did on most of the people he came into contact with. He was personable, charismatic, extremely good looking, and intelligent. In her mind, he was a substitute for her younger brother who had passed away. It was the beginning of a long friendship that never wavered, even as more and more evidence was turning slivers of doubts into shocking realities. Wherever Ted Bundy lived, pretty, young women were dying. \u201dA sexual psychopath, according to Dr. Jarvis, is not legally insane, and does know the difference between right and wrong. But he is driven to attack women. There is usually no deficiency in intelligence, no brain damage, or frank psychosis.\u201dWhatever we may have in our mind of what a sexual deviant is, Ted Bundy did not fit that profile. He didn\u2019t have a scar bisecting his face or a hunched back or a withered arm or bristling insanity twisting his features. To most women, if King Arthur were to take off his helmet, they would want him to look like Ted Bundy. He was well spoken and appeared about as harmless as a man 6 ft tall and 160 pounds can look. He was above suspicion.\nBundy looked more like a lawyer than his lawyers did.Bundy was in fact one of the most dangerous humans to ever walk the planet. He was born lacking one key ingredient, a conscience. Interesting enough, he played on the conscience of his intended victims. He tricked them with a fake broken arm in a sling, a leg cast, and other things that would lower their defenses even further. He had a knack for finding those women most vulnerable, the weakest, and separating them from the pack. He was a merciless predator.There is speculation that he killed over 38 women, but there are others that believe that the number could be well over a 100. All of his victims were beautiful, talented women who just happened to part their long hair in the middle. And why?We always want to understand the criminally insane as if that will give us the keys to protecting ourselves from them. Unfortunately, psychopaths like Bundy blend with us as if they belong with us, but the truth is there is no rehabilitation for someone like Bundy. He is controlled by his darkest desires, his midnight obsessions. I\u2019ve always found Bundy to be one of the more unfathomable of the pantheon of serial killers. It was as if he found his victim\u2019s beauty an affront against his own existence. He was so cold, calculating, and brutal. He was a rising star in the Republican party in Washington state. He even had a gig driving the governor of Washington around for awhile. He was a man with all the tools to become governor himself.I have to give Rule props, though. She admitted to her own naivety. Her disbelief in the face of insurmountable evidence was in some ways frustrating to me. Even with her professional law enforcement experience, she struggled to bring herself to believe that the man she had thought so much of was also a homicidal maniac. There is something very human in her reaction. She was a loyal friend. She believed in the man that Bundy was supposed to be. He wanted to tell her. \u201d\u2019There are things I want to tell you...but I can\u2019t,\u2019 was there something I could have said that would have allowed him to talk to me then?\u201dBundy left a string of bodies in Seattle, Salt Lake City, Aspen, and Tallahassee. He escaped from prison twice which led to more tragedies. His compelling need to kill was too strong to be put on hold even when the very best thing he could do was give himself a new name and blend back into the population again. He...had...to...kill. \nTed Bundy, always the showman, waves to the press. Ann Rule probably had one of the more unique views of a killer I\u2019ve ever encountered. Her account is honest and thorough. You will know Ted Bundy at the end of this book. You still won\u2019t understand him. The fears you have of evil will never be manifested on the faces of the perpetrators. They are hidden beneath the skin. It is something dark inside them that writhes in the place where the soul is supposed to reside.

In fact, as far as I can tell, Ann Rule was the only person to actually benefit from knowing him. And boy, did she ever.To state it quite plainly, Rule is not what one would call a \"great\" writer. Or even really a good \"writer.\" She repeats herself to accentuate her point like she's me writing like I talk when I'm wasted, which I'm fairly sure she's not. She says things like (and I'm paraphrasing here) \"I couldn't have testified in Ted's defense. That was just something I could not do.\" Really? Could you do it, Ann? Could you?!? Wait, I'm confused...so you're saying you could do it or you couldn't do it? You see what I mean.Additionally, she frolics in a minefield of cliches. I suppose when you are discussing something as sensitive as a serial killer's dump-site for a battered, raped, & strangled 12 year old girl's body, you sorta need to bust out a little bit of the old flowery sympathies and \"oh, the humanities.\" And when you find out that you were close, personal friends with a psychopathic killer, people expect a pretty heavy-handed amount of \"woe is me, I never really knew him, will I ever really know anyone, why was I so stupid, who am I, God?\" Debra Morgan ballyhoo. Whatever. Regardless of her lack of authorial prowess, Rule was fortunate enough to work with a nice young man at a suicide hot-line in Seattle who was willing to help her out. Good ole' handsome Ted. Friend. Student. Son. Eldest brother. Fiance. Volunteer. Outdoorsman. Future politician. Saver of drowning children. Chaser of purse-snatchers. Purse-snatcher. Kleptomaniac. Psychopath. Chauvinist. Power-monger. Rapist. Sadist. Serial murderer. Necrophiliac. Con-artist. Liar... ...One thing that you can definitely say about the guy is that his interests were diverse. And his \"interests\" would lead him to commit some pretty shittastically evil crimes. And LOTS of 'em, with ever-increasing voracity and viciousness. And now, Ann Rule had her big break book idea! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! I won't dwell on this point for too long, as Rule has been getting shit about this for decades. I will simply say that she was, in fact, in a unique position to write a fantastic book, and she kinda botched it. Maybe it was supposed to have been Truman Capote working at that crisis hot-line back in 1974.All the same, I enjoyed the book for the sheer fact that I am so fascinated by Ted Bundy. This dude was a smooth operator, which makes him (to my mind) one of the most terrifying serial killers of all time. I mean, just watch the man at work...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ9jqF...That video also contains my favorite \"accidental black comedy\" quote of all time: \"I have been impolite.\" -Ted BundyAll the same, he was one of the most high-functioning psychopaths ever to have been caught. Which makes him someone worth knowing, and knowing well. I won't get too preachy on you here, but I would think that his unique manifestation of psychopathology...the viciousness of his crimes combined with his ability to function somewhat in the spotlight simultaneously...to schmooze his captors so successfully that he was able to escape from jail TWICE and avoid recapture despite his existence on the FBI's \"Most Wanted\" list...to stand as his own attorney, and make thousands of women fall in love with him and fight for his cause and truly believe his innocence despite all of the evidence to the contrary....that he was able to live for 9 years after his initial death sentence on his own legal prowess alone...the simple fact that he was JUST SO GOOD AT BEING A SOCIOPATH would make him a worthwhile specimen. He had all of the \"skills\" of such an individual maxed-out to as extreme a degree as his dark side was. In my opinion, this fact alone would have been good enough reason to keep the asshole alive, especially considering the massive advances we have had in genetics and neuroscience since he was executed in 1989. Findings which suggest not only potential methods of early detection of psychopathology, but also argue for the unfortunate inevitability of much of the violent crimes committed by antisocial personalities when early physical abuse and brain damage are added to the fire. Which makes a whole other argument as to their sanity at the time of their crimes. Which would make an even further argument concerning their eligibility for execution. ALSO, it would just fucking make sense to study these people so we can catch them early. Understand them. I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that we could eventually maybe even HELP THEM. I know...how dare I?Regardless of all that, I believe that I know at least one little lady who might like to know a bit more about genetics and their influence on antisocial behavior...whether she knows she should or not...\nAnyway, I've been reading this under the radar and off and on for some time, and I'm glad to finally be done with it. I didn't want my goodreads friends to know me as \"you know, Kristi. That chick who needs an entire YEAR to read a book by fuckin' Ann Rule.\" Anyway, it was ok. Read it for its subject matter rather than its literary merit.Or just watch this:http://www.guba.com/watch/3000024509/..."}, {"userName": "Ana ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13346584-ana", "userReview": "What\u2019s one less person on the face of the earth, anyway?  \n  Ted has been described as the perfect son, the perfect student, the Boy Scout grown to adulthood, a genius, as handsome as a movie idol, a bright light in the future of the Republican Party, a sensitive psychiatric social worker, a budding lawyer, a trusted friend, a young man for whom the future could surely hold only success. He is all of these things, and none of them. Ted Bundy fits no pattern at all; you could not look at his record and say: \"See, it was inevitable that he would turn out like this.\" In fact, it was incomprehensible.  The All-American boy with a very peculiar hobby. Ted Bundy was a college graduate, did charity work and campaigned for the Republican Party. He was handsome and charming. Hmm... what else? Oh, right, he did unspeakable things to women. Whenever I hear the word 'Bundy', I automatically think of Al Bundy. \nOf course I've heard of Ted Bundy. His name pops up everywhere. People still talk about him thirty years after his death. Probably the most famous of all serial killers, Ted confessed to killing 30 women (though the number of actual victims is believed to be much higher). His acts were so atrocious, I won't list them here. Ann Rule had no idea her buddy, Ted Bundy, was a serial killer, rapist and necrophile. You can't blame her for not knowing. He was the last person on earth that anyone would have suspected of murder. By all outward appearances, Ted was a normal law-abiding citizen. He was a law student, for crying out loud. But then the truth came out- and people were shocked. I mean, come on. Teddy wasn't capable of doing such an atrocious thing. Serial killers don't look like this.\n\n\nThey look like this.\nRight?Wrong. They don't look like Michael Myers. They look like regular joes. They're seemingly regular guys hiding dark secrets.\n  As the years passed, I learned that the stranger at the very vortex of an ever-spreading police probe was not a stranger at all; he was my friend.  During his trial in Florida, Ted proposed marriage to his girlfriend. He proposed to her in the courtroom (I kid you not). She accepted, just like any normal person would. But she wasn't the only one drawn to his presence. Ted had/has legions of half-crazed groupies. It turns out murder is a very powerful aphrodisiac.\nTed could have been anything he wanted to be. A lawyer, governor, psychologist. Instead, he chose to become a killer. He could have had any woman he wanted. So, why did he rape and kill? Some say it is because of his childhood; others say because his first serious girlfriend broke his heart. Ted claimed that porn caused him to murder. (Brace yourselves- porn turns people into killers. To all those who are reading erotic novels- stop it now!)We may never know the truth. \nHere are some interesting facts about Ted Bundy.He was one of the inspirations behind the Buffalo Bill's character in The Silence of the Lambs.He was a masterful manipulator with very high IQ. He escaped from prison twice. (In your face, Michael Scofield). He and Ann Rule worked for a suicide hotline in Seattle. That dude actually saved lives. He helped detectives identify and catch the Green River Killer. (a scenario straight out of The Silence of the Lambs)  One day, the earth and the rivers may give up more remains, all that is left of the young women whose names are still unknown-the women Ted referred to when he said, \"Add one more digit to that and you'll have it...\" None of them could fill the hollow soul of Ted Bundy.  Well I finally read my first Ann Rule book. It didn't wow me, but it was a good read nonetheless. \n  You've called it Karma. It may be. Yet whatever supernatural force guides our destinies, it has brought us together in some mind-expanding situations. I must believe this invisible hand will pour more chilled Chablis for us in less treacherous, more tranquil times to come. Love, Ted."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Ashleigh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33737465-jonathan-ashleigh", "userReview": "This was an interesting read, and for the most part it was written adequately. Due to the geography of the murders (I am from Aspen), I had a particular interest in some of the events. My problem with the book is the self-important place which the author places herself when her own words make me feel as though she was nothing more than a \"Ted groupie\" who sent him money in jail and gave him information. At times, she claims Ted calls her only to talk, and then it is clearly evident by what their conversation is about that Ted had other motives than friendly discussion. She worked next to him one night a week for a year, attended two work-related Christmas parties with him and then had one lunch face to face with him and she claims, \"I may know Ted as well as anyone has ever known him.\" I find that hard to believe. Ann Rule also states, \"Ted's psyche so dominated Meg's (Ted's ex) that I am amazed that she was ever able to break free,\" but, in my mind, I don't understand how Rule was never able to break free."}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun", "userReview": "Wow. This was an exhausting read. Between the epilogue, the afterword 1986, the last chapter 1989, the update: twenty years later 2000, and a postscript penned by Rule's daughter, I thought I might never finish this.That said, it is considered by many to be the definitive work not only on Bundy the serial killer, but also on Bundy the charismatic, attractive, and promising law student.And really. What are the chances? You're a struggling single mom of four, eking out a living writing true crime articles for detective magazines and suddenly not only have you received a contract to write a book detailing a string of grizzly murders, but once the murderer is caught you find out he is a friend and previous coworker. Seriously. You can't make this stuff up.At times, I found Rule's narrative to be repetitive and overly introspective, but I guess given the circumstances, it was hard to avoid. And what the hell. She deserves to get it off her chest. Plus, eventually, she makes some valid observations, particularly with respect to Bundy's final interview in which he tries to \"blame\" his actions on violent pornography and detective magazines (ie true crime stories). I had actually watched the interview earlier on in the reading process and admit that he almost had me biting--hook, line, and sinker. However, after reading Rule's analysis, I think she was spot on. Which, I think is the point. A sociopath, Bundy was a master manipulator, incapable of empathy and lacking a conscience. He certainly wasn't able to fully appreciate his culpability. Pointing the finger at society seems consistent with his character.I personally found some of the add-ons to be of little value, with the exception of the afterword and the last chapter, which both document the remainder of Bundy's ordeal.All in all, a fascinating story told with competence, at least for the most part. If you happen to pick up a later printing like I did, consider skipping the epilogue, the update 2000 and the postscript.As an aside, though unintentional or not on the part of Rule, I think there is an interesting discussion of the death penalty. It took millions of dollars to put Bundy to death, far more than it would have cost to keep him alive. Furthermore, seeing that he represents a \"diseased\" brain, I wonder if \"we\" (society) missed an opportunity to better understand exactly what contributes to the making of a Bundy.I also wonder if as a society we need to redefine what constitutes sanity and insanity and the legal implications. I'm not sure men like Bundy have the power to stop themselves, just like I don't think most of us with normal functioning brains can understand how a Bundy couldn't stop himself. Anyone who does what he did has to be playing by a different set of rules, and it seems to me they are suffering from something that may be no more their fault than a man who is stricken with cancer. What does that mean legally? I'm not sure. But while putting men like Bundy to death \"feels\" right on some visceral level, it doesn't even begin to address the underlying problem. Of course, on the other hand, this is a man who escaped twice, murdering and/or brutally attacking a half-dozen victims before being recaptured. Had he the opportunity, he would have killed again.Anyway, lots of food for thought."}, {"userName": "Maede", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2017", "userURL":

what drove him obsessively.\u201dAnn Rule had signed a contract to write a book on a series of brutal and heinous murders of beautiful young women, not knowing she was going to be writing about the man she had worked alongside at a suicide hotline. A man she had found to be kind and understanding, someone she had began to see as a friend. The Stranger Beside Me is a biographical and autobiographical crime book offering insight into one of America\u2019s most prolific serial killers, Ted Bundy.Straight up, one of the most enjoyable books I read this year. I\u2019m not saying it should have won awards or anything, it ain\u2019t groundbreaking, but as someone who is obsessed with true crime I found it hard to put down. Ted Bundy has to be one of the most fascinating serial killers in history. To be so charming and attractive, presenting this false fa\u00e7ade, when underneath the thoughts and fantasies he has\u2026 the absolutely brutal and heinous crimes and murders he committed, it\u2019s INSANE. Mix in the fact that he managed to escape from prison/officials, not once\u2026 but TWICE. This is also the guy who represented himself in court! And let\u2019s not forget the hundreds of women all over the country, termed \u201cTed\u2019s groupies\u201d who professed their love for him, and thought he just needed someone to be kind to him *rolls eyes so far back into head I go blind*. Honestly, the more I read about Ted Bundy, the more fascinating he becomes.Just as fascinating is his complicated relationship with Ann Rule. Before I read this book, I thought they just kinda knew each other, I did not realise they were actually friends. Rule admits herself that she never quite believed that someone like her friend Ted could be capable of such horrific acts, and it\u2019s not until his capture and trials in Florida that Rule fully accepts that he is a serial killer. Yet she continues to write to him in prison and send money for cigarettes or stamps etc. I believe Rule has gotten some flack for how she perhaps handled her friendship with Bundy, but the conflict she underwent is very apparent in this book. She says a few times that she finds it almost impossible to merge the two Teds: the Ted who was her friend during a particularly tough time in her life and the Ted who brutally murdered a ridiculous number of women.Rule also attempts to find reasoning behind Ted\u2019s incomprehensible acts \u2013 pretty much placing blame on his first love. Stephanie humiliated him so Ted took that rage and revenge out on women who resembled her \u2013 every time he murdered them, he was murdering Stephanie. I think Bundy\u2019s psychopathy is more complicated than us, and Rule actually acknowledges this in one of her number of revisions \u2013 there\u2019s about 4 revisions added on, I think, with updated information.I really could talk about this book until my fingers become little stubs with my incessant typing, so I\u2019ll wrap up\u2026 Although this book does cover the crimes that Bundy committed, it\u2019s more about who Bundy really was and his complicated friendship with Rule. I\u2019ve seen a number of reviews unhappy with this aspect of the book, but I really enjoyed it. Not the best book I\u2019ve read this year, but definitely one of the most enjoyable. I\u2019m still thinking about it days after finishing."}, {"userName": "Jack", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88424-jack", "userReview": "For all that Ann Rule invokes her friendship with Bundy -both before and after Bundy's arrest - the truth is this book could have been written solely off of newspaper research and trial records. There's no real emotional-depth or analysis. And Rule's interjections of what was happening with her personal life are annoying; they don't connect to any of the other events she's writing about, and since her entire description of her feelings towards and interactions with bundy are about as dry as when she's describing third parties, there's no need to know about who she is. I do wonder if Rule has ever written a more straightforward memoir about how she felt, and how she feels, about her dealings with Ted. She was both his friend and someone who could profit a great deal from his friendship, and it leads to some morally ambiguous territory. A book that explored that as a kind confessional/memoir like Bob Woodward's The Secret Man, only darker, could have been really interesting. Instead, Rule just writes passages to the effect that \"I couldn't abandon Ted, no matter what he'd done,\" while eliding the stake she had in maintaining that relationship. If she was going to make herself central to the story, she needed to explore that territory beyond two-dimensional plattitudes."}, {"userName": "Ammar", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3569723-ammar", "userReview": "This was the first book I ever read by Ann Rule and it was the perfect true crime book.

I have read another book by Ann Rule and the thing I like about her books is that even though they are non-fiction they read like a fiction story.This book is about the famous serial killer Ted Bundy who terrorized U.S in the 70's. The story is told from perspective of his close friend (Ann Rule) who had known him before he was ever suspected in any of the killings.The story takes us back to Ted's childhood, his years as youth, the time he met Ann Rule, his relationships and then the series of murders and rapes. We also get a glimpse of the letters exchanged between Ted and Ann Rule during his imprisonment.There is the police case, how the various court cases against him went on and how he escaped twice successfully. I found the investigation procedures and the court trials really good to read.There was a time when his guilt was not proven and he managed to escape out of Jail and was applauded and treated as a celebrity among the people. Even when he was on trial there were 'Ted Bundy Groupies' in the court hearing. This makes me think either people are really stupid or heartless or just Stupid!!The appalling part was he was convicted at one time for 36 murders and he gave a statement saying \"Add one more digit to that and you'll have it...\"The rape scenes and the killings were really distressing and at one time he attacked multiple girls in one night (up to 5). \nHe was brutal and the things he did to the girls were completely horrifying. He took girls from Deserted streets, Bars, Parks, In broad daylight in front of 100's of witnesses or from the safety of their own home. At one time I felt no girl is safe from him in spite of where she is.\nIt took me unusually long (as per my reading speed) to complete this as I could not continue reading this and had to put it down and take a breather (not because it is written badly but because it is gruesome)After reading this I watched 'The last interview by Ted Bundy'. I actually felt satisfied that he was punished and got what he deserved!!\nNote: The reason this is not a 5 star read for me is, as at times there was too much info dump on names and description of people that did not matter and much of this information was sometimes repetitive."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha", "userReview": "This book was absolutely riveting. I had started reading it a while ago, but was reading another book as well and had set it aside for a while. When I picked it up again, I simply could not put it down.Ann Rule is one of the premiere true crime writers, but what made this one special was that she had been friends with Ted Bundy (and had worked with him at a Crisis Hotline!) before he was a suspect in the myriad heinous crimes he eventually confessed to a few days before he was executed.The most riveting thing about the book was the dichotomy that was Ted Bundy. Outwardly, especially in the beginning, he was a handsome, intelligent, charming, and successful man who had the world on a string. Inwardly, he was a mess - not psychotic, as psychologists/psychiatrists would later determine, but an \"antisocial personality.\" He had a deep-seeded hatred for women and all of his victims were the same physical type as a woman who had scorned him in college.In the end, Bundy had more and more trouble keeping his darker side hidden from the world. His later crimes (esp. the ones at the Chi Omega sorority at FSU) showed that after so long without being able to commit a crime (he had been in jail in Colorado for many months and had escaped to Florida), he couldn't control his impulses and ended up attacking four women (killing two of them) in a span of 15 minutes with no one hearing a thing!After his arrest in Florida, he of course maintained his innocence, saying he was being railroaded by the justice system. He also constantly whined about the incompetence of his lawyers and displayed his own sense of intellectual superiority by representing himself at his trials. He was eventually convicted of three murders and was given three death sentences.Ann Rule continued to correspond with Bundy in prison, even providing money for his commissary fund, almost until the end. She was still a loyal friend, but not to the point where she believed unfailingly in his innocence. She knew he had done what he had been accused and convicted of. But she could also remember the young man who had been such a good friend to her in the past.Bundy was executed on January 24, 1989 in Florida's electric chair at Raiford Prison. Ann did not attend, but watched the coverage on television during an interview she was giving. She saw the tell-tale dimming of the prison lights and knew that Ted was dead (after many previous stays of execution).Rule's book is very powerful and gives a good glimpse into the way a serial killer can blend so easily into mainstream society while at the same time committing unspeakable horrors against members of that same society.I highly recommend this book.P.S. - I double-checked all the locks on my doors and windows when I finshed this book. Chilling. Very chilling."}, {"userName": "Book Riot Community", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community", "userReview": "This month I\u2019ve been binge listening to the podcast My Favorite Murder. I\u2019m obsessed. There were a couple of episodes where Karen (one of the hosts) mentioned that she was reading The Stranger Beside Me. I was intrigued. When I picked it up, I couldn\u2019t put it down. Ann Rule was a prolific true crime writer, and this is the work that really put her on the map. Back in the \u201870s, in some weird twist of fate, the serial killer she was writing about turned out to be her friend, Ted. The Stranger Beside Me is a well written and researched insider\u2019s take on Ted Bundy, his murders, and his trial. Not only do we get Bundy\u2019s narrative, but we see the way it impacted Rule\u2019s life. It took her a while to come to terms with Bundy\u2019s guilt, and, when she did, she mourned the man she knew. If you\u2019re interested in true crime and have not yet read this classic, I\u2019d definitely recommend it.\u2014 Beth O\u2019Brienfrom The Best Books We Read In April 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/05/01/riot-r..."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather", "userReview": "4.5/5, rounded down.This book scared the ever-living crap outta me, guys. (Which, admittedly, really isn't very hard to do... but still.)Call me uncultured if you must, but the only thing I knew about Ted Bundy before reading this was that he was a serial killer. That's literally the only bit of information I knew, so it goes without saying that this book taught me a whole heck of a lot. I don't know that I am happy to now be haunted by the idea of this mans evil, sadistic behavior, but it was really interesting and I am glad I spent the time reading it. (I was especially happy to have the updated/revised version with the added chapters.)Ann Rule did a phenomenal job detailing the events in a way that was easy to understand, both in prose and timeline. I thought her account of the whole insane debacle was, at the very least, fair - despite having been such close friends with Ted, she did not let anything other than facts sway her opinion in reference to his guilt (or seeming lack of in the very beginning.)This was really in-depth, well-rounded and very well written. Despite newfound mild auditory hallucinations, (kidding! - or am I?) I very much enjoyed my time with this book."}, {"userName": "Estelle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17934127-estelle", "userReview": "An uneven read.

I worked with professionals learning about campus TV productions, photography, and journalism. Several of the people that I worked with had to go to Bundy's trial to testify for the defense. After he killed the girls at FSU's Chi Omega sorority house, it was a multi media laboratory van that he stole and drove to Lakeland where he killed his final victim and was captured.\u2028\u2028Basically, they wanted to ask everyone if they happened to own a pair of Levi's 501 jeans and might have worn them while traveling in the van. Those were the kinds of fibers that were discovered, and the defense was trying to weaken the prosecution's case against Bundy.When the trial was over and they were free to speak about it, they were pretty shaken. \u2028\u2028Until I saw somebody's status update today, I had forgotten all about this book. For obvious reasons, I loved it - trying to unravel the twisted mind of this man is something that can never be accomplished, but having lived on campus that year and seeing everyone wearing \"Burn Bundy\" tshirts, it was a book I had to read.

It is anyone's guess if this is the case, but I personally think that if pornography had an effect on Bundy, it was only to enhance what had already been created inside him. I certainly don't believe the monster was created because of a rejection by a woman. I personally think that his maternal grandfather, Samuel Cowell, abuser and bigot extraordinnaire, abused Bundy when he was a child. The very fact that Bundy talks of this horrible man as loving and wonderful is a red flag since no one else thinks so! Rule appears to agree with me.

There is just so much wrong with this book that if I list all of it, my review might get to about half the length of the book.Ann Rule cannot write. There are far too many repetitions, poorly phrased sentences, typos, and missing words in the book. I can understand that the 'writer' might have created many chapters from her notes, but that is no excuse for poor editing. The length of the book is too much for my liking. (Did Ann Rule get paid by the number of words she wrote?) Much of the information from the book was available online as well, so it is hardly 'shocking' or an 'inside' story. (I'm not saying that Bundy's actions are not shocking, but rather Ms. Rule's descriptions of them are inane.) Moreover, she plays around with the chronology too much. Also the added chapters are ridiculous. Could she not have rewritten the book instead of adding a 'Final Chapter', an 'Afterword' and then an 'Update'?Caught in a quagmire of cliches and hackneyed phrases, Ann Rule doesn't even try to get out to 'normal' writing.Ted Bundy was a terrifying man, and I think he might just be the most evil character I've ever come across (in the real world as well as the fictional one). Also, the first one-third of the book is promising enough. What I found the toughest to reconcile to was the fact that Bundy actually might have saved lives at the crisis helpline. When I read about Ted, it is easy to imagine that a tough childhood, a screwed up fatherhood/motherhood situation, and the situation with Stephanie would've left him damaged for life.But, his humane side (or what he displayed of it during his volunteer work) was what horrified me. Ann Rule did a good job of that, but she started losing me when she tried to paint herself as someone who almost might have been a victim or someone of interest to Bundy. No offence, lady but Ted Bundy targeted only young, pretty girls right?Also, what I had a hard time understanding was Ann Rule's affection for Bundy despite the latter's almost obvious guilt. In my opinion, she had numerous chances to pull back but she didn;t. (Maybe, I'm being unfair here and I feel this way only because Rule's book has been written in hindsight.)However, she does seem to display far too much sympathy to Ted and far too little to the victims, even if one were to assume that she believed him to be innocent.The description of each trial proceeding became too tedious and it would've been worthwhile for Ann Rule to take a cue from a better writer of courtroom dramas. Also, I don't think she needed to devote multiple pages to the letters that she wrote to Ted or the ones that he wrote to her. She could have simply written the gist of the letters in the book, and added snapshots of the letters to the appendix. If you really want to read more about the man who might have killed many more victims than he confessed to, you might be better off reading up news articles and magazines instead.Overall, the story of Ted Bundy - 3.5 stars and quality of writing - 0.5 stars. Therefore, I can't bring myself to give this book more than a single star.P.S. Also, considering Ms. Rule sent many $10 checks to Ted Bundy, could she please send me one as well to refund me the cost of this utterly pointless book?"}, {"userName": "Medhat The Book Fanatic", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17165680-medhat-the-book-fanatic", "userReview": "[ Not only is Ted Bundy a sadistic serial killer, he was also a rapist and necrophiliac.

I've always been fascinated by Ted Bundy, and actually think I read this before right after it was first published. Now I'm again a little obsessed, watching his interviews on youtube, and on Hoopla watched the made-for-TV movie based on this book. Very good!I clearly remember when Bundy was electrocuted for 36 murders, all young attractive women, many killed in their college rooms as they slept. I was in college at that time. (He probably killed more than 100.)I remember the people outside while Bundy was being executed, chanting, \"It's FRY day, Bundy.\" Girls who fit his type cried and grieved him. Will probably add to this later.UPDATE:Following our book club discussion, I decided to change my rating from 5 stars to 4. It is the story of Ted Bundy we all find fascinating, but not necessarily this particular book or Ann Rule's writing. This book did have, like most true crime books, an awful lot of minutiae, listing every lawyer involved, every witness, every judge, etc., which is why I don't usually read true crime as a rule (no pun intended).

Why? Because Rule was a former policewoman, she considered Ted Bundy a co-worker and friend and never saw the sociopathic personality lurking behind his charming facade. As a society, I think we want to believe that we can easily spot those Bundys, Dahmers, Gacys . . . and Rule's book emphasizes the fact that we cannot. Those monsters blend in sometimes seamlessly with the rest of us. Rule's book does a huge service to Bundy's victims by recognizing them as more than just \"Bundy victims\". Reading about their dreams, their goals and their daily lives makes the horror of their deaths sting even more. Rule's sadness over the story comes through in nearly every page - - sadness at the loss of lives and sadness over what Bundy's life could have been and what he could have offered had he not been so consumed by murder. Having known Bundy before he became infamous as a serial killer, Rule gives insight into Bundy's personality and character, from his childhood, through his adolescence into his political and legal aspirations, all the while fostering a murderous rage toward women. An insightful book, one that makes you check and doublecheck your windows and doors and pray that you never cross the path of someone like Bundy. Definitely one of Rule's best books. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Caroline ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline", "userReview": "***NO SPOILERS***This, Ann Rule's most famous book, is a truly riveting read, never dry, not journalistic, and admirably thorough. One star docked, however, for an underlying sympathy toward Bundy that's very hard to understand much less accept. Rule, who'd been a close friend of Bundy's, spoke of sending him money (totaling several hundred dollars over the years) and stamps while he was imprisoned and continuing her friendly communications with him for many years. It seems unlikely that Rule intended her account to communicate such sympathy, but it is there. With that said, this is not in any way a pro-Bundy book. Rule only grapples with her feelings after discovering her good friend and man she trusted (and frankly, adored) was one of the world's most vicious psychopathic serial killers. In some ways, this account is as much her coming to terms with this revelation as it is a detailed profile and report on Bundy. In short, Rule's book is the benchmark and should be the first readers grab when wanting to learn all there is to know about Ted Bundy. She leaves out virtually nothing in a page-turner that most certainly belongs on any \"best of the best\" true crime books list. Note: Readers interested in better understanding the \"why\" behind Bundy's crimes will want to read the superb Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us, written by the foremost expert on psychopathy."}, {"userName": "Lisa Greer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/583112-lisa-greer", "userReview": "I was hooked from the first page.

I think Rule had great insights, and I think she might be right when she said Bundy probably fooled James Dobson in the famous interview.

I have looked many killers in the eyes...some who committed crimes as disturbing as Bundy's. You can see it in most of them. The most disturbing thing about Bundy is the fact that most people couldn't see it. Even his friend, Ann Rule, didn't see it. \"The Stranger Beside Me\" by Ann Rule is a brilliantly constructed book. It's amazing how she transitions from not knowing anything about the murders to not believing the murders to accepting that her friend, Ted, was a serial killer. It's shocking and interesting to read. This book includes a lot of details that I never heard anywhere until I read Rule's book. I rank this book as possibly the greatest true crime book ever written. It might be second to \"Helter Skelter\". I enjoy all of Rule's work, but this one is different. Her personal connection to the subject makes it even more disturbing. It's brilliant. Her very rounded background and relationship with Bundy give a perspective that we'll probably never see again in another book. I recommend it to anyone who likes reading crime books. It reads like a novel, only it's more difficult to stomach.

My name is Alissa and I am a True Crime addict & a serial killer enthusiast. ::waves::I don't know what the fascination is with this awful people, but any type of True Crime story comes my way and I eat it up. I have a coworker that feels the same and we are constantly discussing which ones are our \"favorite\" serial killers. Morbid I know. You can judge me, it's okay!For me, it has always been Ted Bundy. Ted Bundy was the first one I can clearly remember. As sick as it sounds, he was part of my childhood. I was born in 1982, and he was executed in 1989. I can still remember the media coverage of the day he was killed on the electric chair. He's been dead almost 30 years but he has solidified his place in American history and in pop culture to be remembered. In the movie Silence of the Lambs, Buffalo Bill lures women into his van by pretending to have a broken arm and needing assistance in getting items in the van. Ted Bundy often used a sling or a fake cast to appear vulnerable and have pretty college co-eds play the part of Good Samaritan to help this guy. On the TV show The Following (RIP- I loved that show), serial killer Joe Carroll was a good-looking charismatic man who had legions of followers even after the details of his horrific crimes are made known. Ted Bundy had a nation of women who actually cried and mourned when he was put to death.For this reason, I find Bundy the most terrifying serial killer. There were plenty of other serial killers who killed more people and were more brutal/disgusting (Dahmer, Gein, Gacy). But Ted Bundy? He wasn't the scary boogeyman that they warned you about when you were kids. We were warned about the scary looking, the monsters, the Freddy Kruegers/Jason Voorhees, the ugly obvious creepers to watch out for. But Ted was good looking, and extremely approachable. The kind of man who could go up to women in the middle of the night and they would go off with him and not even have their Creeper senses go off. The type of of man who abducted 12-yr old Kimberly Leach from her school- there were witnesses who saw her crying and him yelling as he put her in the car- and NO ONE reported it because they just assumed it was her father and she was in trouble. This type of monster terrifies me way more than any scary monster in a movie. It's guys like this that give me heart palpitations because I have two young girls who will someday go off to college. And how do I prepare them to watch out for guys like this when NO ONE suspected this guy for the longest time? Because he's good looking and brilliant and well-spoken, and was able to hide an absolute evil part of himself from everyone.

She doesn't go into much detail on the crimes, obviously wanting to believe, and for us the readers to also believe, he's not such a bad guy. Sorry, but I didn't end the book with any sympathy for Ted Bundy, just a greater terror that there can be people out there like that in the world, and people who will admire and trust them to the end of their days.

There were times, late at night, when the two worked together at a Washington state crisis hotline - and this bothered the then small-time crime column writer not at all. Ted Bundy made her feel safe, in fact, when local women were turning up missing - and, eventually, murdered.In writing this book, it became clearer and clearer to Rule that it would perhaps become the single greatest body of work she had ever written (before or since). She learned, only part way through writing about the mysterious crimes, that the perpetrator was the one and only Theodore Bundy. The very subject of her book was revealing himself to her in the guise of a friend.The details of the crimes themselves are quite disturbing. As is typical with Rule's writing, she tends not to dwell exorbitantly upon such in The Stranger Beside Me but upon the known facts of each case, rarely straying from the proper chronology of the disappearances/homicides (save for dramatic effect, i.e. enhanced \"readability\" for the masses). Rule does, however, rely heavily upon her own personal recollections of conversations with Bundy, and situations in which she felt led to her being completely blindsided by the news of his initial arrest. After her years' experience working with law enforcement and writing about some of the worst crimes in American history, Rule (at that time) felt that she understood the criminal mind somewhat. It took Ted Bundy to shake this misguided confidence from its perch, and the revelations which poured forth changed her as a person forever.Perhaps the biggest detrimental factor within this 2009 edition of The Stranger Beside Me is the sensation one gets that the story never seems to come to a definite conclusion. That is, Rule includes four supplemental chapters (including the original 1980 epilogue) which \"update\" the text from the press date of last publication. Rule excerpts some of the hand-and-typewritten letters and poems shared with her by Bundy during his extended period of incarceration, including prodigious specifics regarding his subsequent appeals, complaints, histrionics, etc. After the story's denouement, the supplemental chapters drag out the so-called \"resolution\" to the story (presumably the aftermath of his 1989 execution). However, to simply omit these chapters serves to leave the store unfinished.Rule goes so far as to judge - herself - the validity of the hundreds of \"Bundy sightings\" made by frightened women across the United States and around the world, many of whom took the time to write the author after the initial publication of The Stranger Beside Me. In this manner, Rule seems to depict herself as the wizened onlooker of humanity, having had such great personal insight and omnipotence bestowed upon her through Bundy's ubiquitous presence in her life.Having been placed in such a precarious position, though, as to write about the execution of a man in whom she had held such great trust does give her some very real credibility..."}, {"userName": "Negin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6326169-negin", "userReview": "My feelings about this book are mixed.

I really didn\u2019t care for her confusion, misplaced compassion, and sympathy for him. That sort of mentality simply infuriates and frustrates me to no end.
