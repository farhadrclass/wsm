She\u2019s quirky, comical, and glamorous. She\u2019s fashionable, in-the-know, and in-the-now. She\u2019s lonely, lost, and waiting to be rescued. You couldn\u2019t resist her charm if you tried, and you can\u2019t help but fall in love with her. Well, at least in the Hollywood film version. Capote\u2019s original novella paints a darker portrait of Miss Golightly. Unlike Audrey Hepburn\u2019s adorable Holly, who needs a knight in slightly-rusted armor to save her, Capote\u2019s girl is a \u201cwild thing\u201d who cannot be caged, trained, or rescued.I can\u2019t deny that the film is a classic and is one of my favorites. Audrey Hepburn may be the epitome of glamour and beauty, and Hollywood\u2019s Holly can\u2019t help but absorb Audrey\u2019s charm. By the end of the film you find yourself rooting for \u201cFred\u201d to save her from the nonsense of high society, reunite her with the cat, and wipe away her case of \u201cthe mean reds\u201d forever. That is Hollywood, after all, and we would expect nothing less.But the real Holly, Capote\u2019s Holly, can never be caged by convention. It would be hard to imagine her ever settling down and being content with Fred (regardless of the fact that he is an implied homosexual in the book. Hollywood seemed to have \u201coverlooked\u201d that). Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not that the book\u2019s Holly is a Bad Person; she\u2019s just more layered and real. Think about it \u2013 how many people have you come across who create a new persona for themselves, based on what they perceive others to desire? People who feign interest in the popular styles/entertainment/notable people of the day, just to seem like a Very Important Person and garner adoration, fame, and possibly fortune. I could name a few. But we get to go deeper than Holly\u2019s exterior and see the scared and lonely girl at the core. She is terrified of being a caged animal, but also tired of being alone. She wants to seem as though she\u2019s making a holiday out of life, but struggles with the need for stability and the desire for freedom.The book I read also included three of Capote\u2019s most famous stories, and I\u2019d be remiss not to mention them as well: House of Flowers, A Diamond Guitar, and A Christmas Memory. The three short stories are amazingly intimate and touching, illuminating different sides of human emotion. I have not read Capote\u2019s magnum opus, In Cold Blood, but after witnessing his detailed descriptions and haunting perceptions of human nature in these shorter forms, I have added his novel to my \u201cto-read\u201d list."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Masterson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28953843-jennifer-masterson", "userReview": "3 delicious hours of audio read by Mr. Michael C.

You take a man that likes to walk, a man like me, a man's been walking in the streets going on ten or twelve years, and all those years he's got his eye out for one person, and nobody's ever her, don't it stand to reason she's not there? I see pieces of her all the time, a flat litle bottom, any skinny girl that walks fast and straight--...It's just that I didn't know you'd been in love with her. Not like that.\"\nSo it is we know that Holly Golightly is gone, that she's been gone for years. And she had her effect on Joe Bell, the bartender at that little place down on Lexington Avenue in the Big Apple.\nYeah, there's Joe's place. Look hard enough, it's one of those little places tucked away. You probably can't see it. One of those Yellow Cabs is hiding it. Yeah, Joe had it bad. Most men who knew her did, unless they just wanted to use her. There's always that niggling little thought on the nature of what love really is. That it is pure and natural or that it can be purchased. Anything is possible, after all, because everything is negotiable.Truman Capote first published Breakfast at Tiffany'sin the November, 1958 issue of Esquire Magazine.\nIt was considered too obscene for Capote's usual sources for periodical publication, Harper's Baazar and Mademoiselle. After all, it's open to question as to whether Holly is a prostitute. And being a woman who speaks her mind, she wishes she could have a bull dyke for a roommate because they make such excellent housekeepers. Such language would never do, so it was off to Esquire. Random house followed suit, publishing \"Tiffany's\" as a novella.\nWhat man hasn't known and loved a Holly Golightly. I have. I lost her. She was hit and killed by a drunk driver--hit her on the wrong side of the road. It was head on. She never had a chance. She was driving home on a Sunday evening, after dinner with her parents, her adopted parents. She shared several characteristics with Holly Golightly. She didn't know her real parents. She enjoyed men. Her hair was that shining perfect blond with bands of white that made her always look as though the sun shone directly on her head and hers alone. She liked her men older, too, like Holly. Maybe it was being adopted, not knowing where she came from, not knowing where she truly belonged.But Holly Golightly had taken a new identity, running away from Tulip, Texas, married at the age of fourteen to Doc Barnes, a veterinarian. Her real name is Lula Mae Barnes, just as Capote's mother's name had been Lillie Mae Faulk before she took a more sophisticated name, Nina, after she married Cuban business man Joe Capote.I attended her funeral, one of so many, her male coterie. But it was when the minister pulled out a copy of The Velveteen Rabbit and began to read from it that I was stunned. For I gave her that book, in the hope, the dream that she would realize if you love anything enough it will become alive. She kept that book all the many years we were apart. Perhaps on some days she thought of me. I know that I still think of her and on some days, like Joe Bell, the bartender, I see bits and pieces of her as I walk the city streets, especially when the sun illuminates the gold, the white, the platinum of a feminine head of hair as if it showed on no other person on boulevard, no matter how bright the sun. Oh, you say Holly Golightly was a brunette--like Audrey Hepburn. Well, that was Blake Edwards' idea of what Holly Golightly looked like. But it wasn't Capote's idea who should play her. It was Marilyn Monroe. No question. It was that blonde hair, almost platinum. But Capote only sold the film rights. He maintained no control over the direction or production of the film.Capote was such a wonderful dancer. I can still remember photographs of him swirling Marilyn across the dance floor.\nBut Lee Strausberg told Marilyn playing Holly Golightly, a prostitute, wouldn't be good for her career. Monroe turned down the role for \"The Misfits.\" It would be her last film. But that's another story.History took its course. Henry Mancini composed \"Moon River\" for the score. George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn had chemistry. Following its release in 1961, Edwards' work became one of the iconic American films. However, it bears little resemblance to Capote's work, although Audrey Hepburn is stunning in that little black dress.It was not uncommon that movies made from Faulkner's books premiered in Oxford, Mississippi. One, to Faulkner's chagrin, bore so little comparison to his original work, when called to the stage to make opening remarks, Faulkner said, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, the film you're about to see bears absolutely no resemblance to the book I wrote from which the title of this film was taken.\" He walked off stage and out of the theatre. I can't imagine Capote taking that approach, he was still connected to a famous film that led to further sales of his work. Perhaps it was that desire for fame that ultimately destroyed Capote.Of course, in the novella, the young writer is unpublished. Holly takes it upon herself to make him famous by introducing him to her Hollywood agent. In the movie, Peppard is a kept man, whose, shall we say, sponsor, is played by Patricia Neal, who is known to Holly as 2E, the lady's apartment number. And, of course, the movie ends happily ever after with George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn embracing in the rain and having found \"Cat\" whom Holly had kicked out of the taxi cab.But Capote tells Holly's view regarding love, or whatever feeling she is capable of describing as love.\n \"Never love a wild thing, Mr. Bell,\" Holly advised him. \"That was Doc's mistake. He was always lugging home wild things. A hawk with a hurt wing. One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky.\"\nTruman Capote considered Holly Golightly his favorite character. I think he was right in his feelings. Of course, Capote, has said that the narrator of Breakfast at Tiffany's was gay. In fact, it has been repeatedly surmised that Holly Golightly is the literary embodiment of Christopher Isherwood's Sally Bowles. What divine decadence. The movie would never have ended the way it did, had Capote maintained creative control. Let's just say this one will always touch a nerve in me. This one is for all the Holly Golightlys in the world and the Joe Bells who have the sense to listen to them, and I offer it with all the heartfelt sympathy I can muster for those who can't understand what it means to love a wild thing."}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "Capote has a mesmerizing way with words. His description of the aptly named Holly Golightly is splendid and the character herself is a sort of blend of Daisy Buchanon and Madame Bovary. The friendship of the narrator Paul/\"Fred\" with Holly is beautifully and painfully described as are the parties and lovers that she entertains. I must see the film now...(see below)The atmosphere of the book is a sort of bohemian yet preppy post-Beat decadence but with a tragic sexism that poisons Holly's relationships with everyone except the narrator. She is both an actor and a victim of her status as a sex object - this is what transports this story from something banal to something more complex and enduring.The Diamond Guitar is a tender story of unrequited love as well, albeit homosexual love and longing and disappearance.House of Flowers is a vivid depiction of a Haitian whorehouse, the Champs-Elys\u00e9es and the sadomasochistic love of Ollite for Royal that leads her to an indifferent fate at the House of Flowers.A Christmas Memory is a heartbreaking tale of camaraderie between a young boy and an older woman and their dreams of surpassing their humble existence.Each of these stories of love, loss, and hope against hope that avoid sentimentalism in their cold rendering of events. It is more the external elements (the weather in New York, the changing seasons at the farm, the bee prophecy and the wind respectively) that color the psychology of the characters and their ambiguous fates.I loved these stories and will read more of Truman Capote's work.I started watching the movie with the amazing Audrey Hepburn as Golightly and George Peppard as \"Fred\" and find it captures the essence of the relationship between these two characters. However, why did they have Mickey Rooney do that ridiculous (and perhaps racist) imitation of Yunioshi, why not just have a Japanese actor. The other annoying thing about the movie is the comic spin that it puts to the book which while at times somewhat humorous was for the most part darker and more layered than depicted by Blake Edwards."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "This is getting shelved under \"The Movie is Better\" but honestly, I can't decide which version I prefer. Because I am indecisive, let's make lists.Reasons The Movie Is Better:-Audrey Hepburn plays a considerably less racist and foul-mouthed Holly, which is nice. But let's be honest: Holly could spend the entire movie snorting crack off a sidewalk and Audrey Hepburn would make it the most elegant and classy crack-snorting anyone had ever seen. -Holly actually sets foot inside Tiffany's, instead of just talking about it. Also she is actually seen eating breakfast outside the store, instead of just mentioning it offhandedly. -The lines, \"It's useful being top banana in the shock department\" and \"I don't want you to take me home until I'm very drunk. Very drunk indeed.\"-A happy, schmoopy, formulaic romantic ending in the rain that never fails to win me over. And they come back for Cat. -George Peppard. Reasons The Book Is Better:-Mag Wildwood, a mere caricature in the movie, gets more lines, personality, and scenes in the book.-Holly is eighteen at the beginning of the story, which makes her instantly more of a badass teen slut, which I admired her for. -Mr. Yunioshi actually has a sizable shred of dignity and is vital to the plot. This did wonders to undo the damage caused by the sight of a sweaty, overtanned, bucktoothed Mickey Rooney leaning over a banister and screeching, \"Missa Gorightry! I musta plotest!\" *shudder* Is Mickey Rooney dead? If not, could someone please find him and kill him for thinking he could successfully imitate a Japanese man without turning into a walking stereotype? Thank you.That's all I can think of at the moment. Bottom line: the book made me sad, and the movie does not."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "A charming little anecdote about some ruby-rare bright young thing & ensuing crew-- delightly-ful!

So begins Truman Capote's classic Breakfast at Tiffany's, the tale of New York society girl Holly Golightly. As soon as Fred hears about Holly, the story flashes back to 1943 and we begin our story of Holly. Growing up I knew Aubrey Hepburn as Eliza Dolittle and Tiffany's as a diamond store, so I envisioned Breakfast at Tiffany's to be a tale of the upper crust of New York society dining at the Plaza Hotel. How wrong was in these thoughts. Our protagonists live in a brownstone apartment, not the Plaza. \"Fred\" named in honor of Holly's brother is a festering writer who seems to be Capote himself and his upstairs neighbor is a mysterious girl named Holly Golightly who adds traveling to her business cards. Until the two have any interactions, Holly remains an enigma, adding to her mystique. Throughout the book, Holly still remains an enigma even after she and \"Fred\" build on their friendly, platonic relationship. Who is Holly? Is she a Hollywood starlet or Arkansas hillbilly? A New York society girl or prostitute or a member of the mafia? Because the novella is only 100 pages in length, Capote tackles all of these ideas while really building up Holly's character. Even though I prefer epic novels, I also enjoy a shorter story that flushes out a character's personality and has me captivated from the first pages. Capote's novella does this and then some, allowing me to quickly read to the conclusion. Tiffany's does make an appearance in the novella although not the way I had thought it would. Holly in spite of all the glitz in her life, wants to be remembered the same when she has the money to eat breakfast at Tiffany's. Does this mean she will be down to earth or a multi-layered character? Will she keep the same company or dine with movie stars? Capote hints that Holly would prefer the former but never tells us, allowing for the reader to draw their own conclusions. Again, this device enabled me to read the novella in one sitting so I could find out whether or not Holly ever ate breakfast at Tiffany's. I would be remiss if I did not mention the three other stories included in this novella. All of them bring out Capote's prose and show us why he is highly regarded as a classic American writer. The collection ends on a high note with A Christmas Memory, allowing is some insight into Capote's family life growing up. I look forward to seeing Breakfast at Tiffany's on screen to compare the movie to the book and also reading his masterpiece In Cold Blood.

Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s 1925 Jazz Age masterpiece The Great Gatsby. I was intrigued further to find that several other reviewers had noticed the same similarities. Both involve and are centrally concerned with a charismatic and alluring socialite with humble beginnings and sketchy personal details and with a subtle naivet\u00e9 hidden under a mask of societal cunning bordering on the streetwise.I would also draw a comparison between Holly and Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s Dolores from his 1955 work Lolita. Both heroines exhibit a frank and earthy, almost playful sexuality that is intoxicating to the male characters, who pine and lust with barely contained libido.Finally, I see similarities between Capote\u2019s themes and settings and Hemingway\u2019s 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises, especially between the tense platonic relationship concerning Holly and the narrator and Hemingway\u2019s Lady Brett and Jake. Both male narrators are sad caricatures of voyeuristic and doomed love, both pale also-rans to the Latin rivals.In Holly Golightly, Capote has created an archetypal American woman of the twentieth century, at once sexual and material, yet in a playful, teasing and fun way. He could have written another hundred pages of scenes with her and I would have been as captivated as the unnamed (except casually by Holly) narrator. Of course, Audrey Hepburn\u2019s 1961 portrayal was so intoxicating as to become one with Capote\u2019s vision.Capote has penned a dandy and, like the best chocolate, it is a guilty delight."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "The theme that unites Breakfast at Tiffany's with the three much shorter stories in this volume is the powerful bond of friendship between unexpected people or in unusual circumstances.The title story is a male fantasy - so I wrote in 2010. Except that Capote was gay, so it's probably his idea of a typical straight man's fantasy. As Carmen says in a comment, she's what we'd now call a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.HollyThe story is of course about Holly Golightly, a charming but utterly self-absorbed, mysterious fantasist, full of intriguing contradictions. She has big ambitions and none at all, but she does want the security of having breakfast at Tiffany's. She is often flirtatious, but at other times she plays the total innocent (e.g. getting her neighbour to put sun oil on her). At times she is oblivious to what people around her know and think, but at others, she is remarkably perspicacious about the personality and motives of those around her. Knowing more about Holly only makes one realise how unknowable she is. When talking about her childhood, \"it was elusive, nameless, placeless, an impressionistic recital\".FredAt times, the narrator acts like a stalker of his attractive and enigmatic neighbour (examining her rubbish and investigating what she read at the library), yet he didn't alienate me. Perhaps one reason is the way that Holly uses men. As the men are happy to be used by her, where's the harm?FilmIt's written in such a visual way, that I'm not surprised it was turned into a film.

It explores the friendship between the working girls, and how love is hard to discern in such an environment.

You'll end up looking at the sky.\u201d\nTold in a reflective and almost lyrical tone, this is the story of a writer, referred to as 'Fred', who reminisces about the neighbor he fell for back in 1943. The thing is, I\u2019m not sure if we ever get a glimpse of the real Holly Golightly.An enigma of sorts; Holly\u2019s not one to get attached or share much of anything about her past. She avoids the truth by putting a fun and often ridiculous spin on things and she\u2019s full of biting comments. It\u2019s hard to say who she really is under that facetious facade. From all outward appearances, she\u2019s a nineteen-year-old woman who enjoys the company of many men and pretty things. A woman making her way, amidst the excitement and wonder of New York City.The few things she openly admits - the soft spot she has for her brother (the actual Fred) and her cure for the mean reds. She claims being surrounded by the quiet of Tiffany\u2019s, although we don\u2019t actually see any of that in the book, is enough to calm her soul. You can\u2019t think of the movie, read this book, or in my case listen to the audio without picturing Audrey Hepburn as Holly. She\u2019s become synonymous with Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. So my question is - what happened to the trips to Tiffany\u2019s and the ring? Having seen the movie several times before listening to the audio, it felt to me like a piece of the story was missing. With a very different ending, the book didn\u2019t come across as the great love story the movie did. It almost makes me cringe to say this, but I actually enjoyed the movie a tad bit more than the book.The crazy cat lady in me has to mention how heartbroken I was that Holly left her \u201ccat\u201d behind, too. How could she? At least, he ended up with a home, I guess. And maybe even a name.If you\u2019re a Dexter fan, like me, you\u2019ll love this audio. Michael C.

The phrase \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" is iconic for that era. I'd not read the novel despite Truman Capote coming from the 2 states in which I've lived nearly all my life: Alabama and Mississippi, both of which have indisputably earned their places as regular punching bags of all outside the South, especially the cognoscenti and other snobbish bastards who would rather point fingers in a direction than look at all the bigotry around them.I might be a little differently affected by this short novel than many others, especially those who grew up in a large metropolis. Before I explain what I mean, I'll say that I found Capote's short novel to masterfully display this young lady's complexities of character underlying the shallow facade of wealth. Capote shows how some of us are willing to do nearly anything to achieve a dream, no matter how grandiose or superficial others may find it. Holly Golightly was a dreamer extraordinaire or as Capote put it, a \"lopsided romantic\" whose trait of personality would never change.A poignant line which I think best captures a major theme of the novel is Holly's observation late in the novel that: \"it's better to look at the sky than live there; such an empty place, so vague, just a country where the thunder goes and things disappear.\"Though I've lived all my life in the American South, I'm not a redneck. I recall the first time I went to New York City. I was in awe, which is more of a small town thing than Southern. I've been many times since and the sheer size of it never fails to amaze me. City people, particularly those in NYC, are disgusted by such provincialism--a contempt they cannot hide. Even though I'm straight, I think I can imagine how it must have been for an outcast sissy-boy from Monroeville, AL and Meridian, MS, trying to make his dreams come true in the Big Apple. Certainly, he would have been very sensitive and keenly observant of his environment in New York City, having grown up ostracized by his classmates. The fact that he was a gay man from down South up in the big city (suffering prejudices in NYC against not only his sexuality but much moreso against his Southern upbringing and drawl) probably served to further enhance his remarkable attention to detail in that society, at that time. These difficulties formed an integral part of the artist who so vividly painted one of the best ever outsiders looking in with longing."}, {"userName": "Sidharth Vardhan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58296635-sidharth-vardhan", "userReview": "\"Anyway, home is where you feel at home.

When I found out the real reason the title is what it is, I was disappointed that this book was an early version of product placement, but even with all of that said - Breakfast at Tiffany's is a great book. I believe it is a take on the great American novel that focuses on feminine personality. I'll probably read it again, and I'm going to watch the movie as soon as possible."}, {"userName": "Lynda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13400128-lynda", "userReview": "Marilyn or Audrey? Who do you think?When Audrey was cast, Truman Capote remarked:\n\u201cParamount double-crossed me in every way and cast Audrey.\u201d\nIn one of the most iconic scenes in film history, it would be impossible to think of anybody other than Audrey Hepburn wearing the \u201cLittle Black Dress\u201d while looking into the window of Tiffany\u2019s. Well, if it had been up to the author of the book on which the movie is based, Truman Capote, it would have been Marilyn Monroe. In fact, he wrote the book with her as the character in mind. Even the movie\u2019s screenwriter, George Axelrod, wrote the script tailored to her. Marilyn was actually talked out of taking the role by her acting coach, Lee Strasberg \u2014 he felt that playing the lead role would be bad for her image. The bookBreakfast at Tiffany's, set in 1943, documents the friendship of a New York writer (whose name is never mentioned) with his neighbour Holiday (Holly) Golightly. Both live in a brownstone apartment building in Manhattan's Upper East Side. The story is presented as the writer's recollections of Holly many years after the conclusion of the friendship. Holly is a woman of mystery to everyone in her life. There is ambiguity surrounding her profession; she has no job and lives by socializing with wealthy men, who wine, dine, and give her gifts and money, together with the ocassional overnight stay. Was Holly Golightly a prostitute?In a 1968 interview in Playboy, Truman Capote addressed the question:\nPlayboy:\n \"Would you elaborate on your comment that Holly was the prototype of today's liberated female and representative of a \"whole breed of girls who live off men but are not prostitutes. They're our version of the geisha girl.\"?\nCapote: \n\"Holly Golightly was not precisely a callgirl. She had no job, but accompanied expense-account men to the best restaurants and night clubs, with the understanding that her escort was obligated to give her some sort of gift, perhaps jewelry or a check ... if she felt like it, she might take her escort home for the night. So these girls are the authentic American geishas, and they're much more prevalent now than in 1943 or 1944, which was Holly's era..\"?\n Breakfast at Tiffany's excels in imagery, the prose lyrical. It has many layers to it. Abandonment, loneliness, the need to belong and yet not be chained at the same time, the delight in the unorthodox and not loving a wild thing.This was a sad book in lots of ways. We have Holly who is an odd mixture of childlike innocence and street smart sexuality, confused yet determined, who knows very well what she wants and will walk over others to get it. Then you have the other characters in her life who are obsessed by her, whose lives evolve around her, and no matter how bad she treats them, they come back for more.As a reader, it is difficult to like Holly. She is referred to as a phony as she hides herself behind interesting lies and an eccentric lifestyle. She wants no responsibility or ties to people or things. She keeps disconnected and unloving for the freedom of her feelings.I enjoyed the book more than the movie. Capote describes Holly in such a way that you get the sense he has moulded her on someone that he knew, someone who intrigued him and held an allure or aura of mysticism that left a deep impression.A gread read!"}, {"userName": "Brian Yahn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22849115-brian-yahn", "userReview": "How does one review something so good?

She was beautiful, she was mean, she was independent, sometimes cruel, sometimes caring. Holly was as free as a bird, but shackled by her birth. She was temptress and torturer. She was glue and glamorous. Holly was light and darkness. She conquered and crashed. She loved and loathed. Holly:\"... good things only happen to you if you're good. Good? Honest is more what I mean. Not law-type honest -- I'd rob a grave, I'd steal two-bits off a dead man's eyes if I thought it would contribute to the day's enjoyment -- but unto-thyself-type honest. Be anything but a coward, a pretender, an emotional crook, a whore: I'd rather have cancer than a dishonest heart. Which isn't being pious. Just practical. Cancer may cool you, but the other's sure to. Oh, screw it, cookie -- hand me my guitar, and I'll sing you a fada in the most perfect Portuguese.\" Her story is narrated by her upstairs neighbor, an aspiring writer, who befriended her, despite a downstairs neighbor, Madame Sapphia Spanella's outspoken wrath against Holly:  \"A crude exhibitionist, a time waster, an utter fake, somebody never to be spoken to again\". But Holly was also 'pampered, calmly immaculate, as though she'd been attended by Cleopatra's maids'. Nineteen year old Holly was from Tulip, Texas, before she landed up in New York. Since the age of fourteen she was on her own, taking care of her brother Fred, who was in the army. He loved peanut butter, which she bought for him anywhere she could find it during the war times. \n\"Fred's a soldier,\" said Holly. \"But I doubt if he'll ever be a statue. Could be. They say the more stupid you are the braver. He's pretty stupid.\" \"Fred's that boy upstairs? I didn't realize he was a soldier. But he does look stupid.\" \"Yearning. Not stupid. He wants awfully to be on the inside staring out: anybody with their nose pressed against a glass is liable to look stupid. Anyhow, he's a different Fred. Fred's my brother.\" \"You call your own f-f-flesh and b-b-blood stupid?\" \"If he is he is.\"\nThis is a short novella, about a female character who deserved her place as one of the most outstanding literary characters of all times. What captured me the most is the way this young woman was presented to the world. Someone who could be loved; a young woman who could become a friend. She had heart and soul. She was warm and wonderful. But just as cold and calculating, since she did not quite trust the people's intentions towards her and therefore never really allowed herself to bond with anyone. \n\"I like a man who sees the humor; most of them, they're all pant and puff.\"\nHer actions prevented people to come too near, even her friends stood aside. A tragic figure. A statistic for the cognoscenti, the people who despised the likes of her. The film adaptation of this novella was very different from the book. I suspect nobody wanted to play the lead role of Holly, since it was unacceptable for their careers. And to get Audrey Hepburn to be the star, the script had to be changed considerably. The most important difference was to portray Holly as an innocent young woman who did not prostitute herself in the movie. The male lead, played by George Peppard, became a romantic character instead of the gay writer who became her friend in the book(he fell in love with his childhood postman). In the movie he also became a toy-boy himself to a wealthy women (not part of the book). Although I enjoyed the movie, I loved the book much more.Truman Capote created a complex character in his iconic writing style. Nobody can forget Holly Golightly. The social realism of the 1940s-New York embraced this girl next door, and made her something very different than the normal portrayal of these social climbers. She became a person with a heart and soul. Someone to empathize with. A wonderful, soul-touching story. A classic must-read."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32804270-michael", "userReview": "Perhaps the most famous of Capote's works, Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s charms the reader with wit and a lively storyline. Its subject is the short-lived friendship between a straight woman and a gay man living in New York during the early '40s, its theme the yearning for deep connection and a sense of belonging. In spite of Capote's ethereal prose and dazzling imagery, an excruciating sadness suffuses the novella: none of the self-destructive characters find what they long for by the end, and it seems unlikely that they ever will.

This backwards (at times almost nostalgic) glance at a life which had all but vanished from anything but memory (the whimsically kind and cruel and slightly tragic Holly Golightly) reminded me more of Willa Cather's My Antonia than Capote's other seminal work, In Cold Blood. Of course, Antonia and Holly Golightly have virtually nothing in common except in how they occupy the center of the narrator's imagination. When Jim Burden explores Antonia's character, he discovers depth he didn't fully understand when he was a boy. The narrator of Breakfast at Tiffany's finds a disarmingly charming shallowness in Holly that hides complexity neither he (nor the reader) can fully understand. In the end, the Holly of Capote's novella doesn't match the charming portrayal of Audrey Hepburn in the movie, but Holly, I think, was meant to be a little darker, someone closer to tragedy than the stuff of dreams."}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "I listened to Breakfast at Tiffany's as an audio, which is a perfect way to absorb this one.

I will give only a full review of Breakfast at Tiffany's though, because that story was my only interest. I almost didn't read the other short stories, because I simply didn't want to read them. But I read them, and I wasn't disappointed. I will give a brief summary of all three. The three other stories were called The House of Flowers, A Diamond Guitar, and A Christmas memory. They were all realistic stories, about a relationship, either a friendship, a family bond, or marriage. Nothing really caught my eye, or had a message, but all seemed to be floating in reality. They were there, and they were gone.So, let\u2019s get back to the main review. Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s is about a beautiful, young woman, Holly Golightly, living her life to the fullest no matter the cost. The story was narrated by her apartment neighbor and eventually \"best friend\" who Holly referred to as Fred.One: I never watched Audrey Hepburn\u2019s 1961 film, Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, or I might have watched bits of it because I know the ending. I can\u2019t sit still watching movies. I am really a terrible movie goer. I LOVE Audrey Hepburn, and I am ashamed that I never watched this classic film. I wish it was on Netflix. She is a GORGEOUS, and I idolize her. Audrey is really the prettiest woman I have ever saw in my entire life. One time I was looking up pictures of her and decided to cut my bangs to her style. It was a horrible, horrible idea, because I don't cut hair. I blamed it on my husband for not stopping me.Two: Do you guys remember that 90s song called Breakfast at Tiffany's? It was sung by Deep Blue Something. Well that song kept replaying in my head while reading. I found it funny, but utterly annoying. I would be in the middle of a sentence and my brain would turn up it's speakers during the chorus. \"And I said what about Breakfast at Tiffany's? She said I think I remember the film And as I recall I think, we both kind o' liked it\" dodoododoodoooodoodooo. Needless to say the song will be stuck in my head for a few days.There are two things I really liked about the novel. I am giving it a 4 star because of Audrey, being a classic novel,  Holly, and the  symbolism. Holly Golightly in simple terms is a bitch. Even \"Fred\" said that at the end. She is the type of woman you despise, because she will lie, cheat, and steal from you. She lives to gain momentum, and she will do anything to get her way. She is callous, well she has one care, but she lives on her own terms. She want her freedom. Her head is in the clouds, which I can understand. It isn't a bad thing to live in the clouds. Her personality is horrible. Still I despise her, but I was entranced by her. Holly has that intoxicating feel, and you cannot just see her only one time. No, you have to watch, and see what will happen to her next. It was like watching a train wreck. Will she fall madly in love with any of her many suitors, and become caged? Will she finally be caught by the police? Will she love \"Fred\"? Read and find out.I really liked the symbolism. A few examples: An expensive cage was given to \"Fred\" by Holly for Christmas. She asked never to cage anything in her life. The cage is imprisonment, of course. A wild animal, like Holly (another symbolism), should never be caged. Taming a wild beast will never make that animal happy. Just like the Orcas at Seaworld, with their curved dorsal fins. This is how Holly felt about life. Of course the cat was the representation of herself, and they both loved each other at the end. Finally, when all Holly's belongings fell into the gutter, I thought it represented the end of Holly. I think I will try harder to find the movie. I know the endings are different, but I will see how well they match against each other. I will wait a bit before watching though. If I watch too soon I might get angry at the differences. Happy reading everyone! I might add more to my blog later. I had to speed this one through. I remember having more thoughts.

Sadly enough, in my opinion neither are perfect. I wish there was some way to take the best of both and smush them all together...Holly Golightly is such an iconic figure of the 20th century. The little black dress, the tiara at breakfast time, eating pastries in the street outside of Tiffany's in New York and Audrey Hepburn's beautiful smiling face. Her elegance, her interpretation of Holly's quirks... When I first saw the film I actually hated it!! Which was very upsetting to me because I love Audrey Hepburn!! I wanted to be her when I was little. My BFF loved Marilyn Monroe but I was an Audrey fan. Roman Holiday is one of the most perfect films ever made in my opinion. I know all the words to My Fair Lady. Funny Face even made me like a Fred Astaire film much to my mum's chagrin; she was not a fan! But back to the film adaptation of Breakfast at Tiffany's... I never liked the character of Holly! Her quirks annoyed me, I could never fully empathise with her and the first time I watched it I have to admit that I was less than impressed. I didn't think that there was any genuine love story between George Peppard's character and Holly so that never made sense as a main plot point of the film to me. And don't even get me started on Mickey Rooney's casting....Seriously??? Someone thought that was okay???? *judging you Hollywood*However, probably about 10 years or more passed by and Breakfast at Tiffany's was on tv one Sunday afternoon and I gave it another shot... and I am pleased I did! On second viewing I warmed to Holly's character; I think I was much too young when I saw the film for the first time and was unable to understand a character that didn't always do the right thing. So a little more maturity and a greater appreciation of Audrey Hepburn's acting abilities made me enjoy the storyline an awful lot more! And suddenly I could understand (some of) the fuss around this film. However, I still didn't buy into the whole love story!!! And then we come to the novella... And I'm right back at square one again!!!I just did not like it!!! *hangs head in shame* I can fully appreciate the writing style; there are some beautiful quotes and passages that can really touch you to your core... But these characters: Holly, our nameless narrator, the bar keeper, the roommate... For whatever reason they all blended together and no part of the story really jumped out and grabbed my attention. I couldn't feel it. I wanted to, and at times I felt heartless because of some of the lovely prose... \n\"Never love a wild thing, Mr. Bell,' Holly advised him. 'That was Doc's mistake. He was always lugging home wild things. A hawk with a hurt wing. One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky.\"\nBut I had that same problem with Holly again, I could not connect to her. And this time there was no Audrey Hepburn to rescue me. Holly was just too irritating for me. I know she is very much the proverbial bird that you can never cage and I do appreciate the beauty and bittersweet nature of that essence of her. But all her interactions with Sal 'the tomato guy', her leaving Fred... I could not reconcile myself to those parts of her personality. I did however love the ending. Oh it's waaaaay better than the film's ending. Much truer to Holly. \n\"You can love somebody without it being like that. You keep them a stranger, a stranger who's a friend.\"\nBut here is the thing. I don't mind reading books where I don't like the main character. If a book is well written enough, with a plot that holds my attention, then it does not matter if the protagonist is likeable or not. In fact it can make a story a lot more interesting if the main character is morally reprehensible in some way. So what happened here??? For all the lovely quotes I can pull from the book, there are many more that I did not care for. I know this book was first published in the late fifties but that still doesn't excuse some of the offensive language and stereotyping for me. I couldn't move past it and it just made me uncomfortable and really hampered my ability to fully enjoy this. Also, I didn't like the structure of the story, wasn't a fan of the pacing... If I'm honest there was very little that I did like. (I know...sorry Holly fans!)To me the story of Holly was told to us by a narrator who loved Holly. Someone who could see all her flaws, could see the past that had scarred her, someone who could see that she was a beautiful bird that should never be snared... So through his eyes shouldn't I have also seen Holly like that and therefore loved her wholly??? I think that is my primary problem with this story. I was supposed to love Holly... but sadly I never did.So I'm in a bit of a quandary. How do I rate this? Should I leave it another few years and read this story again?? Perhaps then I will learn to love Holly?? Who knows! For now this is floundering around the two stars marking... but I reserve the right to revisit this story in the future and to hopefully fall in love at second sight. (Or should that be fourth sight if I include the film viewings?????)two starsAnd because I love Audrey Hepburn and this song...\nMoon RiverMusic: Henry Mancini.

You'll end up looking at the sky.\" (Holiday Golightly).Holiday \"Holly\" Golightly is pursued by mafia gangsters and playboy millionaires. She is a heart-breaker, a traveller, a perplexer and a tease. She is mean and she is kind, she is naive yet knowledgable, her character is contradictory. She lives in a dream and never settles into one place, ready to take flight. She's unique and she is an enigma, and this is what draws the narrator, \"Fred\" , in.This story is told from \"Fred's\" POV. He is looking at Holly's social circle from the outside in, trying to make way into the circle where martini parties, gramophone music and socialising take place. It follows how he thinks and feels about Holly, her turbulent lifestyle and how him and Holly meet and interact during their time spent together. Largely it faces how he is intrigued by her, and through this curiosity and wonder, he forms a love for her. Through their interactions together, \"Fred\" also meets a number of interesting characters intertwined with Holly's life. Truman Capote does a brilliant job of writing and describing these characters and their settings, that it is easy to imagine the scenes of the book.Through these interactions and the revealing and unravelling of characters, you begin to understand that Holly's life has had some very dark moments, despite her usual put-together appearances and fun lifestyle. Holly's character is definitely a tease and her life-style sounds so interesting. There's constant socialising, propositions and scandal- she never has a dull moment. Her life is especially interesting to imagine through the time period of 1940s New York. Her character is definitely the opposite to most people and this is what draws you in to her. She is an enigma and she is fascinating.This book also contained 3 short stories: \"House of Flowers\", \"A diamond guitar\" and \"A Christmas Memory.\" All were very well written and lyrical in their prose. My favourite was \"A Christmas Memory\" which examines an important friendship between a young boy and his older cousin. It explores loneliness and friendship and you develop empathy for these characters. It was a short story and gripped me from the start.Overall a rather good modern classic and a very easy read ! \u263a\ufe0f"}], "description": "\u201cWhat I've found does the most good is just to get into a taxi and go to Tiffany's.
