Geneticist Marianne is recruited to work with the aliens although her specialty of population genetics hardly seems relevant to the epidemiological threat facing the planet. Her adult children embody responses to the arrival of the alien. Marianne's daughter is an immigration enforcement officer who id deeply suspicious of them. Her older son is a biologist who again is hostile to the aliens thinking of them as an invasive species. And her youngest son has spent his life looking for meaning and belonging, and the aliens may offer that to him.This novella models the reaction of the world to alien arrival and subsequent bad news, spanning disbelief, anger and all the negative reactions that panicking humans are capable of as well as great effort, bravery and sacrifice on the part of people working to stop the oncoming disaster. It focuses mainly on Marianne and her youngest son's experiences in isolation though, so the crisis is at a remove and almost doesn't quite feel as real as it might in the narrative, even though it does intrude in violent ways.This has been expanded into a trilogy of novels starting with Tomorrow's Kin, and it should be very interesting to see where it goes, particularly if the first book ends where this novella does."}, {"userName": "Bob Milne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2224905-bob-milne", "userReview": "Interesting and thoughtful, but fundamentally flawed, Yesterday's Kin is a book that ultimately fell flat for me. There's no question that Nancy Kress is a woman of ideas, it's just that I don't necessarily agree with (or appreciate) all of them.My biggest quibble with the tale is how overwhelmingly pessimistic it is. Really, it offers a very dim view of humanity throughout, continually harps on our fears and prejudices, and then wraps it all up with an extraordinarily heavy-handed reminder of how violent and spiteful we can be. While many other authors have used their science fiction to explore our darker side, there's usually a redeeming quality there, a glimmer of hope that at least some of might succeed despite ourselves. Still others throw out that pessimism at the end, as an ultimate sort of twist, but there's no such twist here, just the acknowledgement of the inevitable conclusion.My secondary quibble - and this one, I admit, may be deliberate - is that there's no sense of wonder or awe to the story. We start it in medias res, with the aliens already here, and their ship already in orbit, denying us that all-important glimpse of first contact. The aliens themselves are very human (that is, in fact, the point of the novel), so there's little sense of wonder there, and we don't really get to see much of their technology (beyond the energy shield, which fields so much of the pessimism). Like I said, I understand that much of that is likely deliberate, in that it help feed the suspicions the characters have as to the aliens' true motivations, but I would have taken a different approach.My final quibble is that, for a story that's so much about family and relationships, I didn't care for a single character. Seriously, I found them all odd, cold, distant, and unlikable. There wasn't much personality to any of them, and there's so little context to their relationships outside the alien crisis, I found it impossible to connect to them or really care about their dilemmas.Having said all that, the idea of the aliens is interesting, and there are some nice cultural flourishes towards the end. The story does move at a decent pace, and there is some real tension to several aspects of the story. None of that is enough, however, to redeem the flaws or to endear me at all to Yesterday's Kin. It's not altogether a bad novel, but there's really little to distinguish it.Originally reviewed at Beauty in Ruins"}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5476515-amanda", "userReview": "3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "It's odd when a novel of the future feels a little old-fashioned... there's nothing at all wrong with that, but to me, this feels like it harks back to a lot of books I've read that were published in the 70s and 80s. I just haven't encountered many not-too-long, idea-based hard sci-fi novels lately. Maybe I just haven't been picking them up? Actually this is more like epidemic-thriller meets hard sci-fi. Aliens arrive, and make first contact. Or - they sort of make first contact. They're quite reclusive, inside their shielded ship. They say, through their mechanical translators, that they are here on a mission of peace: they wish to work with humanity to discover a cure for a coming event that threatens to wipe out humanity: Earth will soon be passing through a 'spore cloud' full of a virus which, they say, will kill both humans and aliens, unless a solution is found. To this end, the aliens demand that a number of UN leaders and scientific experts be brought to them. One of these is the middle-aged geneticist Marianne Jenner. The aliens seem to think her recent paper in 'Nature' documenting a previously-unknown mitochondrial haplogroup is relevant to the current crisis - but she's not sure why. Conveniently, for purposes of the plot, each member of Marianne's family ends up embodying one of the different attitudes humanity takes toward the aliens: Marianne herself is open-minded and curious. Her daughter, a top Border Security officer, has one set of concerns. Her older son, an environmental expert on invasive plant species, sees the aliens as invaders. And her younger son, who's always been a social misfit, seeking to 'belong' through drugs, sees other possibilities in the aliens altogether. The plot presents some interesting scientific ideas, and throws in a few unexpected twists. It's a good, solid sci-fi novel.Many thanks to NetGalley for the opportunity to read an advance copy.

They touched down next to\u00a0NYC and immediately shielded the ship with an opaque wall of energy. No one has seen them. No one has conversed with them. All they will say, over and over, is that they are here\u201cTo make contact with humanity. A peace mission.\u201dDespite the innocuous reassurances, they\u2019ve been rather shy about actually making said contact--at least, until now, when an obscure paper in genetics finally breaks the loop.\u00a0Marianne was thrilled enough to have her paper on evolutionary genetics accepted into Nature, but she cannot even begin to imagine the ramifications of her work or the bombshell that the aliens are about to drop on Earth.\u00a0One of the aspects that I really enjoyed in Yesterday\u2019s Kin is the science. The plot involves everything from panspermia to the mitochondrial Eve to the bottleneck event theory. The story itself centres around Marianne and her children, the belligerent Elizabeth, the passionate Ryan, and the hapless Noah. Yet although the story is about families, I felt distanced from all of the characters, unable to connect or empathise with any of them. This strange sense of isolation is oddly fitting: in some ways, the characters are cut adrift from one another, trapped in mutual incomprehension of each others\u2019 minds and hearts. Marianne\u2019s emotional and mental distance from her children, her closest family, serves to reinforce and intensify\u00a0the book\u2019s overall theme of biological kinship. As Marianne thinks,\u201cYes, she had seen her grandchild. But whatever comfort or connection that had been supposed to bring her, it hadn\u2019t. It seemed to her, perhaps irrationally, that never had she felt so alone.\u201dAs always seems to be the case with alien stories, much of the plot focuses on determining which side of the trope these particular aliens fall on. While the overall story is promising, I think this would have worked better as a short story rather than a novel. For me at least, it felt as though much of the book\u2019s volume was taken up with\u00a0rambling or repetitious\u00a0scenes, and while these may have served to increase the tension, I found them rather tedious. While the ending is interesting, it is eminently guessable from about halfway through. Perhaps my disconnect from the characters warped my viewpoint, but I felt that given the rather limited worldbuilding, the story was too drawn out for the meagre payoff.At the same time, the book is a fast and enjoyable read. I loved the way that Kress intertwined the themes of alien-human ties\u00a0with family ones. Some of the characters' thoughts\u00a0about relationships were especially poignant; for example:\u201cWhen your children were small you worried that they would die and you would lose them, and then they grew up and you ended up losing the children they\u2019d been, anyway.\u201d\u201cHe had always been selfish. He\u2019d known that about himself. Only before now, he\u2019d called it \u2018independent.\u2019\u201dOverall, while I think the story could have benefited from a certain amount of judicious cutting, I still found it an enjoyable read, and would recommend it for fans of slow-building plots and scientifically-detailed alien tales.Excerpted from my review on BookLikes, which also has additional spoilertagged sections.\n ~~I received this ebook through NetGalley from the publisher, Tachyon Publications, in exchange for my honest review. ~~"}, {"userName": "Frank Errington", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3553381-frank-errington", "userReview": "Review copyA quick comment on the cover art by Thomas Canty. Eye-catching and a nice blending of the extra-terrestrial and DNA themes of the story. This would make me pick up the book and at least see what it's about. Kudos.Nancy Kress is a well-respected and prolific SF novelist with more than 30 published novels to her credit. Her latest work, Yesterday's Kin, was published last September. It's a relatively short piece, coming in at a bit under 200 pages.Yesterday's Kin tells the story of the Deneb, visitors from another galaxy, but there's a twist. The visitors aren't exactly aliens. Their stated mission is peaceful, they're here to warn us of a \"spore cloud\" with an Earth trajectory,which could unleash a virus that could decimate the world's population. A lab is set up at their Embassy in New York Harbor in a race against time in a joint effort to find a vaccine to protect humans from extinction.But there is so much more to this multi-layered story. I particularly liked the writer's handling of the public's reaction to the space travelers and their stated purpose. In many ways it's the same way we react to change in the 21st century. I couldn't help but think about how divided we are over the Affordable Healthcare Act and how much of a panic there was over the Ebola threat. Take that and multiply it to a global scale.As much as the story is about visitors from another world and the horrors of global annihilation, it's mostly about family connectionsOverall, I found Yesterday's Kin to be an enjoyable read. True, not everything made perfect sense, but much of what I read for enjoyment makes no sense at all. I can certainly suspend my disbelief long enough to allow for a few leaps in logic.Available now from Tachyon Publications and the usual online retailers, Yesterday's Kin can be purchased in paperback and all of the popular e-reader formats.Recommended."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7891507-rose", "userReview": "[ Why would some alien race scoop up all the humans in one family group, take them to another planet, and never return??

It was a quick and pleasant read, though I must admit I guessed the twist fairly easily (am I getting good, or what? I used to never see them coming...).I quite liked the science the story rested on (mitochondrial DNA). I'm not knowledgeable enough to tell whether everything was right or not, but it seemed to me it was, and I didn't find it difficult to follow the more technical explanations later in the book.The relationships between characters were interesting, and echoed the way aliens and terrans remained estranged from each other: isolationist aliens, communicating only with a select few, in an isolationist country, while the world has to face the prospect of a widespread, lethal disease... yet all the while, the concept of \"family\" keeps playing an important role, as a reminder that no matter what, emotional ties remain strong.The reason why I didn't like this book more is mostly because I thought it was too short. There would have been so many aspects to explore, go deeper into: the characters themselves (interesting family dynamics, that would've deserved more \"screen time\", especially as far as Ryan and Elizabeth were concerned); the reactions in the months between the aliens' arrival and the actual beginning of the story; the reactions of the rest of the world, too. The novel broached these topics, and gave more than just a few pointers\u2014yet for me, it was a case of \"either you've said too much, or not enough\". I wanted more, plain and simple, more of what looked like a fascinating society (the aliens), more of the humans' actions and views on what would happen after the end. There's a strong opening there, with two equally strong possible outcomes, and I felt it just ended a little too abruptly.A good and entertaining story nonetheless. I do'nt think I've ever read any novel by this author (though I have one of her \"how to write\" books), but I'd definitely check out for more of her works in the future."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob", "userReview": "...That being said, I did enjoy the science Kress put into this story an awful lot. The use of genetics in science fiction is widespread but I can't think of any other author in the field who takes her inspiration from recent scientific research in the field like Kress does. The life sciences are a very important part of her story but she consistently manages to keep her stories quite close to the everyday life of the characters. It is not the sense of wonder Kress is looking for, but the impact on everyday life. They are a combination of fascinating science and well drawn characters. Stories that are both emotionally powerful and thought provoking. In many ways Yesterday's Kin is a signature Kress novella. If you liked her other work, you can't really go wrong with this one. I have read Kress stories where the elements of the story fall into place more convincingly but it is still a high quality read.

However, pricing shorter work the same seems a tad disingenuous. Then again, there is nothing to suggest that Amazon does not consider this to be a fully fledged novel. Perhaps the author does not either.This is the first time I have read Nancy Kress, so I have no idea how her latest work compares to what she has done before. To me, this seemed like a brief sketch or initial try out for a much longer work: an immediate red flag in this regard is the fact that Kress provides no explanation for the appearance of the strange 2001 Monolith-like structure on the Denebs\u2019 home world that points them initially towards Earth. Yesterday\u2019s Kin is a rather bland First Contact novel: curiously human-like aliens land in New York, warn the UN about an impending deadly interstellar spore cloud that the Earth will pass through in about a year, which begins a race against time to find an antidote.Kress fleshes out this join-the-dots plot by looking more closely at the lead scientist\u2019s dysfunctional family, which of course includes the token rebel son ... Anyone who has seen the telly show V. will know already how this particular narrative strand plays out.And that is the biggest problem here: there is really nothing new that Kress adds. The \u2018big reveal\u2019 at the end is telegraphed so loudly so early on, that it came as no surprise to me at all. I am unsure if this is because I read so much SF that I can spot a trope galumphing in from a mile away. Whatever the case, this is a rather anaemic read.I would recommend this to non-regular SF readers who want to dip a toe into genre waters without going native."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "This novella has two complementary storylines, really: each relies on the other to give it more meaning and to create tension, although each could be a satisfying story on its own. One thread of the story isn\u2019t SF at all, as such: it\u2019s about family and belonging, knowing who you are and knowing who your family are. The other thread is fairly typical SF: an alien civilisation contact Earth saying that they are very close to humans, genetically, and that a disease that devastated them is coming toward Earth. So then there\u2019s a scramble to find a cure or a vaccine, with plenty of secrets and inequalities in the relationships, etc, etc.Where the two come together is in the customs of the aliens, which emphasise family, and one of the scientists from the humans, who has besides her interests in genetics a somewhat dysfunctional family. I\u2019m not going to spoil the various twists in the story which weave the two threads together, because I found it fairly predictable even without hints!My main feeling is one that I\u2019ve had before with Kress\u2019 writing: I didn\u2019t really feel the emotions deeply. It seemed like I should, but there was something distant about the characters. I could relate to them fine, but I almost didn\u2019t believe their emotional moments, their turmoil. It was quite weird, intellectually recognising each reaction and knowing it was appropriate for the situation, and yet somehow not feeling as if it was real for the character.Overall, I liked the ideas and the way the two threads work together, and though I\u2019d begun to expect the twist, I did enjoy the way it happened.

Marianne, acclaimed scientist and mother if three, and her aimless addict son Ryan are the narrators of this interesting tale.I enjoyed how plausible this story was. From the public's reaction, to the reticent nature of the aliens, their cultural differences and the aliens' physiology, this book had an ironically 'down to earth' feel. In fact, one of the most implausible elements of the book was the way every member of the family became involved with the extraterrestrials, albeit in very different ways.

I'm not usually on the same page with award committees with all of their choices, though I've certainly found some great stories by using them as reading lists every year. But this story was immediately interesting and engaging. I was drawn to the characters and the mystery. And the mix of hard science and family dynamics and social dynamics was really appealing as well. The sugarcane drug may be one of the most horrifying I've read about, at least on a personal level. It's too much like my dreams coming true, I can see too easily how people could want to get lost in sugarcane if they were already lost in real life. I don't know why I have no imagination when I'm awake, but asleep whole worlds and lifetimes open up to me. It would be hard to let go of something like that, the idea of even trying it while I'm awake, especially with my illnesses making my real life less than ideal, is pretty scary. I had a lot of sympathy for Noah and sugarcane addicts. I hated to stop reading it when I was passing out tired and was excited to pick it up again the next day. I even found myself thinking about it at one point during the day, which was amazing considering how tired I was the night before, I should have forgotten all about it. It was really engaging, more so than any other story in the book, though the couple others that were engaging did stand out (the ones I kept saying, \"Why don't the other stories feel as alive and vibrant as this one?)The family dynamic in the story was very real and touching. They loved each other, they didn't understand each other, they could barely speak without fighting, but they were there for each other as soon as a phone rang. The mom was bewildered by who her children had become and how their relationships had turned out this way, but completely devastated at the thought that they might die in the threatened viral apocalypse. \"When your children were small you worried that they would die and you would lose them, and then they grew up and you ended up losing the children they'd been, anyway.\" That broke my heart a little because it's so true. Marianne, the mom, couldn't wait to get rid of the noise and mess and insane schedules and then it was too quite and neat and she missed them dreadfully.

Horizons fundraising drive; I wanted to read more Nancy Kress because her After the Fall, Before the Fall, During the Fall was just so darned good. Also to keep up my efforts to keep reading female authors. This is a really clever alien contact story, which like so many of the good ones tells the reader more about humanity than about any putative alien species. Here, an alien ship arrives - apparently from the direction of Deneb, although not actually - and eventually tells the humans that the Earth is heading for a 'spore cloud' that will have disastrous consequences. The aliens are here both to warn the Earth and to seek answers to the problem of the spores, which will get to their planet some time later. The story is told by Marianne, a geneticist who gets involved in the work with the aliens, and her estranged son Noah. They bring completely different perspectives to the story, of course, which are nicely complementary; they also allow Kress to explore family issues which are crucial to the story she's telling. The science is really a important part of the story: how scientists work, what risks they can and should take, what everyday life in the lab is like (boring). Neither more nor less important is the social aspect. How does a mother deal with children who are different from her - and how do they deal with her? How can the world deal with knowing that there are aliens out there, and that a disaster is approaching? And then there's the politics too: this is set in a US that has become increasingly isolationist, a powerful border security force and many people wanting heavy tariffs on imports and restricted migration - and how does that play with the arrival of aliens? At 189 pages, this is a short novel; it's fast-paced, easy to read, and wonderfully engaging."}, {"userName": "Jacqie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2133111-jacqie", "userReview": "This book was about a different kind of alien invasion, one in which the aliens are actually humans that were taken away by other aliens many millenia ago and dropped on a world to fend for themselves. These human-aliens look pretty much like us, except for being taller with extra large eyes (to compensate for the lower gravity and light on the planet where they live).We see this invasion through the eyes of a geneticist and her son, a young man who never feels like he fits anywhere. The geneticist is asked to help the aliens, who are hanging out in their ship in a harbor in NYC. The aliens know that an interstellar plague is being blown toward earth (and toward their planet too) and want help in finding a way to combat it. The ship in the harbor felt a little like \"V\", and a lot of the story is given to the fears that many humans have about the alien-humans. Their story is not taken at face value, and many people think that nefarious motives are at the root of the alien landing. Terrorist activities sprout up and civil unrest grows.The geneticist's son is addicted to a drug that gives him an artificial personality. When he takes it, he could feel like a businessman, a sports star, a soldier, a rock musician- he never knows until he gets high. This idea of drug-driven identity is a fascinating concept, and frankly, I wish that more had been done with it than the alien story, which dragged a bit, never really generated much tension, and had a very unsatisfying ending."}, {"userName": "Star", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/304219-star", "userReview": "YESTERDAY\u2019S KIN touches on issues of xenophobia, family, and humanity. When the Denebs come to Earth, stating they are on a mission of peace and discovery, not everyone on Earth is a believer. Earth may be facing extinction and collaboration with the Denebs may be their only hope. Intertwined is the Jenner family. Marianne is a geneticist who has been asked to work on the issue. Two of her children are firmly against the Denebs and all they stand for, and the third has been wandering aimlessly through life until the Denebs appear. Caught up in the frenzy to save their world from whatever threat they may fear most, the Jenners are a big focal point of this novel. YESTERDAY\u2019S KIN is a beautiful blend of science and drama. There is enough scientific information to make the story all too plausible, but the true focus is on the \u2018human\u2019 aspect.

Evolutionary biologist Marianne Jenner is invited with other elite scientists to find a cure. Two of her three adult children - militaristic Elizabeth and environmental activist Ryan - are isolationists and suppose a conspiracy, whereas drug addicted Noah finds himself in the center of alien interest.
