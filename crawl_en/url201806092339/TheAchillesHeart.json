I've never been a fan of research, but I loved scouring over millions of pictures of Zurich, Nashville, and Washington, D.C. The Achilles Heart took me on a year long adventure, and I hope it takes you on one, too."}, {"userName": "Laura Worden", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1058635-laura-worden", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of Karyn Rae and she does not disappoint in her second book in the Achilles series!

The first book was amazing, I couldn't put it down at all. This book was no different. It picks up right where The Achilles Heel left off. Annie is caught off guard when a blast from her past comes back home. She needs to find out if she wants to be with the past or move on to the future. Karyn writes great books. She knows when to pull on your heart or make you upset and yell at the characters when they are being idiots. I loved this book. I loved the chemistry that each character has with one another. Very few mistakes and you can relate to the characters. If you read the first book, you need to read this book!!"}, {"userName": "Shelly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4890746-shelly", "userReview": "Love reading my friends novel.
