Also, it\u2019s obvious the author never set foot in Southern California. Further into the valley is safe. It\u2019s the forgotten land. All the signs are in Spanish. Residential streets are kept nice by the occupants, alone. The businesses are the opposite. They\u2019re rundown, graffiti-covered, bar-protected pieces of crap. No corporate or government money comes to take care of the place or the people. They got here, they crossed the border, now they have to fend for themselves. And I get it. But when you see it in person, it\u2019s a shitty sight. The dive we pull into makes the place we just left look like luxury. But we all know the truth. No one will bother us here. And the cops wouldn\u2019t look for white guys in \u2018Little Mexico.\u2019Nice racist cliches here, Fahleena, dear. And they don\u2019t stop. Here is how the white hero describes the Latina heroine.She\u2019s exotic. A firecracker. Ooh, an exotic, fiery Latina. That\u2019s not a lazy stereotype, nope, not at all.But maybe the plot works? The characters?Here\u2019s Luna, our \u201cheroine.\u201d Isn\u2019t she just adorbs?I watch \u2018Alice\u2019 go to the kitchen window to talk to men who look like they could be my family. And there they are slaving away for minimum wage. I will never do that.No, working an honest job is too much for our precious Luna. Shoving the photograph into the girl\u2019s terrified face, I keep my voice hushed, as I demand, \u201cWhere is he? You recognize him! I can see the fear in your eyes!\u201dBut I found him. He\u2019s here. Not in this restaurant even though he owns it. But he lives not far from where I stand. I can almost smell the rank odor of his cologne, I\u2019m so close. Standing here in the tiny section that separates the back alley door and the rear entrance to the kitchen, I pull out my gun and point it at her. \u201cNo more lies. Do I look like a patient woman to you?\u201dLuna is SO smart! She knows the guy owns the restaurant AND lives nearby - but still uses a gun to terrify a restaurant hostess! Luna REALLY hates restaurant employees.Apparently, Luna the restaurant hater (earlier in the sample she treats a diner waitress horribly - I hope the waitress spit in her food) is in LA for the ever popular \u201cget revenge on the super powerful man who wronged me by shooting him, I guess, at the home address I don\u2019t know but I am sure to be able to break into even though he\u2019s so super powerful he apparently traffics in women and keeps them enslaved at the super posh restaurant he owns where super rich people eat but don\u2019t notice the enslaved women.\u201dThe hero of the story is a generic motorcycle club biker whose eyes focus on her double D cleavage and his thoughts go immediately to ripping her clothes off and whose constant erection would be the envy of any Viagra pill popper. What does generic guy want - other than sex? What are his goals - other than sex? His motivation - other than sex? Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Of course he doesn\u2019t have any. The two meet in a diner and bond over treating waitresses like subhumans incapable of having their own name, and then meet again in a very confusing scene right after Luna is threatening Restaurant Hostess. Apparently the motorcycle club busts up the restaurant? But they give no reason? And it\u2019s implied it\u2019s to rescue the enslaved women but they leave only with Luna? And Luna goes with them because she wants to know why they busted up Bad Guy\u2019s restaurant but then she stays with them because, reasons?

This book had my emotions all over the place and it deals with some gritty and horrific subject matter. I love a good MC read and seriously the darker the better. This author did an amazing job giving readers a different side to the MC world. The author wrote this story in a way that I felt so drawn and connected to the characters and to their unique love story. Cocky Biker is told in alternating POV\u2019s and getting to know the real Jett and Luna (Sunshine) gave me more insight into their minds. Jett is a big bad ass biker, everything about him screams BAD, of course his cockiness and arrogance helps that persona. He and his boys are on a mission to bring down scum and save as many people as possible. He has no problem getting women and is confident about his ability to please them, but when he meets Luna his bad ass persona quickly meets its match.  I loved Luna\u2019s character. She is hardened by life and doesn\u2019t believe in men. She looks so innocent which is anything but true. When Jett and Luna cross paths at the same place, both wielding guns, fate has other plans for the pair. Luna\u2019s story broke my heart. She appears so put together but she is stuck in the past. Her past is something so brutal and painful that it seriously brought tears to my eyes. This author did an amazing job bringing two characters together who are more than they seem. I really enjoyed watching Luna being tough and carefree even though unconsciously she had a need to be with Jett. I really loved how this big cocky Biker is so soft caring and vulnerable with Luna. This man is an open book with his feelings and his actions are clear. Watching him trying to prove himself to this woman who has only known pain and disappointment by men was just so touching. They battle the most dangerous and vile men in the world, but the real battle is between themselves. Jett and Luna are hot together when they are out fighting evil. They share some priceless moments together. I just couldn\u2019t get enough of them. If you are looking for a great MC read with a twist than this is your book. You won\u2019t be sorry."}, {"userName": "Wilja", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40211206-wilja", "userReview": "Jaaa naja es war ok.

She will not get a penny more from me. Ever! Anyone that feels her readers are too dumb to figure out what book is written by her even if another book shares the same word in the title does not deserve loyal readers. I'm appalled that anyone would speak for me and say \"it's too confusing for my readers to have another book with the word cocky in it. They were mistakenly buying someone else's books\". I'm not a rocket scientist, but I have no problem weeding through all kinds of words in a title and buying the book written by the author I wanted to read. So, thanks but no thanks Faleena. I, as your one time fan, did not need you to file a trademark on the word cocky to protect ME from buying the wrong book. Anyone that can so carelessly and selfishly use their readers as an excuse for greed and bullying will never have my support or money.That being said I've decided to not remove my review, however I feel that readers should be warned to not start a series they may not be able to finish if the true character of an author that goes beyond abhorrent is an issue.Hotness Rating 3 out of 5I am in love with this Cocker Brothers of Atlanta series. It all started with a first in series freebie and now I can't get enough. Faleena Hopkins has a gift for writing these brash, cocky, sexy and hilarious guys that steal your heart with their loyalty and innate goodness. Jett is the black sheep of the Cocker family - at least according to his father. Raised in a well-to-do, political family his motorcycle club path is not something that makes his father proud. But, the Cipher's aren't your typical motorcycle club. They help those that can't help themselves no matter the risk to themselves. Jett's loyalty is legendary. Loyal to his family, loyal to his club and when he meets Luna loyal to her. Luna is a strong chick that needed someone to share the burden with. She didn't know this of course and fought it tooth and nail. Raised in a whorehouse populated by women who were forced into that role through human trafficking was definitely not a good way for a little girl to begin life and then to see her own mother's lifeless body drug from a room like trash at the age of 10 was sure to leave lasting scars. These experiences created a woman that was independent, distrustful and hell bent on revenge. Her journey was admirable yet painful to read.Jett was the perfect guy for Luna. He was patient yet strong and prepared to deal with her bad attitude and tricks. When he knew she was it for him he dug in and was there for the long haul. Oh but the scene where he couldn't take the hurt anymore and gave in to it was so hard to read. I cannot say enough about this series and these brothers. So Good!!!!

He f*cking hates that I live outside the law. I'm Jett. I don't care that I come from old money. The Ciphers MC - They're my chosen family. We are servants ONLY to our code, our mission. We live it. Breathe it. Search for it. The same force that drives storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, propels us. Like them we arrive without warning and level sh*t, to erect something superior. A loner, I never expected on the most dangerous of our missions to meet an irresistible feral cat. I nicknamed the kitty, Sunshine, and she is anything but. My name is Luna, not Sunshine. I am darkness. Only one thing matters to me...killing the man who murdered my mother when I was ten. I don't have time for Grey Eyes - a f*cking biker named Jett Cocker. No matter how ridiculously hot he is, or how skilled at playing my emotions like a violin. My WHOLE LIFE I've been gearing up for this. I've finally found the murderer. Now. Is. My. Moment. So why am I wasting time with Grey Eyes in this motel room...why is he making me forget my pain? The Cocker Brothers of Atlanta, Georgia, have earned their nickname -- The Cocky Brothers. Their daddy taught them to be real men. Their momma told them, \"Hold out for a different kind of woman.\" They have one thing in common: ARROGANCE. Cocky Biker gives you everything that you expect from a Biker Romance and then a bit more. There's suspense, romance, sex and general bada**ness, from the hero and heroine. The characters are gritty and real and there's some moments where the right thing to do is a little bit wrong in the eyes of the world. Luna is definitely a product of her upbringing. But while on the outside she is tough and determined, her inner thoughts leave no doubt that inside she really just wants to be loved. But the best bit is that she doesn't actually change who she is for someone else. She is definitely her own person and won't let anyone change her. Not that that always works in her favour and she was definitely the one holding back the relationship. While Jett didn't have as bad a family situation as Luna had had, he had his own issues to deal with and I liked that Hopkins spent the time dealing with his family issues as well as Luna's. Family was clearly important to both of them (which made the ending just perfect!) and for them each to get the same amount of weight in the book worked well for me. There was definite tension between them, and I liked that though the lines between attraction and affection were hazy from early on, initially they just acted on the attraction. There was something a bit more realistic about that. Their relationship took work, but they did work well together. This was a good read, I'm looking forward to more in the series!"}, {"userName": "Kristal Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20199123-kristal-taylor", "userReview": "Wow what another great book \ud83d\udcd6.

Thirsty and hungry they stop at the same diner where Luna is. Jett notices Luna and is immediately drawn to her. Not wanting to pass up an opportunity with the beauty he sits down at her table. Luna wants no part of his overconfident persona and makes it known to him that his presence is unwanted. Unbeknownst to Jett Luna is on the same mission as the Ciphers only hers is filled with animosity and vengeance. What starts out as simple flirting sets Jett on fire when he realizes that the woman who keeps running from him is the only woman he will ever want. ABSOLUTELY RELISHED this fast paced well-written romance. The author aced this story with sultry characters, breathtaking vivid scene descriptions, witty dialogue, spine-chilling action, and blissful moments. The fusion of reality and fantasy make this a most impressive story. Their relationship is far from dull, but then again who wants boring; it does have its ups and downs and scary moments too. I felt sincere empathy for Luna, but through it all, she does get more than her happy ending with Jett making this a fantastic and gratifying read.

Normally I have not been drawn to any book about a Motorcycle Club, just didn't think it was for me, don't let that stop you. This was an eye opener, not all bad boys are really bad. Faleena Hopkins has a way of getting into her characters heads so that as you read you can understand who they are and how they got there. She understands how to put the reader in the characters head and feel what they are feeling. Her characters are complex and not just pretty faces. There is a depth to them. I love it because you can see them developing as the story goes on. Even though this is fiction it feels like it could be about real people and real events. I enjoy fantasy that is either so fantastical it couldn't possible be real or believable enough that you wonder if it really happened. This is the latter and so not only is an enjoyable read but one that makes me really think. There were points that I had to stop for a minute and had tears in my eyes! By the end I was emotional and relieved. My family noticed how it was effecting me and knew I was so involved and vested in it that they didn't bother me the entire time! Please read Cocky Biker and be prepared for a book you will want to read again. I know I will. I received my copy as an ARC for an honest review but I must say this is a book I would gladly buy. I may just have to buy the paperback just to have so I can reread when I want to feel good. I can to sy enough good things about this book"}, {"userName": "Lisa books", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57066156-lisa-books", "userReview": "JettNett is the bad boy of the family riding with a mc that's modern day robin hood.

Jett is part of the Ciphers Motorcycle Club. They go in and help in situations that the police can't due to their hands being legally tied. The group travels across the country doing 'jobs' for people that need the Braun that the Ciphors bring. While traveling the group comes across a woman, Sunshine that catches Jetts attention. Their next encounter is where the Ciphors job is. Sunshine (Luna) is on her own personal mission of revenge. She has lots of walls up but it seems the Ciphors are there to shut down a human trafficking ring. Turns out Luna has a similar interest. Luna has lived a horrific life and doesn't trust, especially men. The story has intrigue, suspense and shows more than one type of family. I received a free copy of this book from the author solely in exchange for an honest review. I look forward to reading more books by Ms Hopkins in the future."}], "description": "JETT:I want her and she won't even tell me her name.The Ciphers, we're the Robin Hoods of MCs.Our latest mission is the most dangerous we've faced.I thought we'd get in, get nasty, and get out.I didn't expect to meet a woman as wild as a feral animal.Normal women bore the f*ck out of me.I need this one.
