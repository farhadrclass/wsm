The time: 1936. The backdrop: The most famous Olympic Games in modern history, an event in which American black athlete, Jessie Owens, disproved the Nazis absurd racial theories by winning four gold medals.Hannah, already living for some time in Switzerland, has crept back into Berlin. She\u2019s there under an assumed name, and under a false passport, ostensibly to report for the Swiss press, but actually to continue her work as a spy for the British.Hannah is well-known to her colleagues in the German press, and already wanted by the Nazis for her previous activities, so the danger she\u2019s in, this time, is greater than ever before.And it\u2019s exacerbated by insecurity. Lars Lang, her collaborator, is an SS officer who might well be a double agent.The action begins with a bang, when Peter Weill, Hannah\u2019s colleague and mentor, is murdered, at the Olympic Stadium.And it doesn\u2019t let-up until the very last page.The stadium, by the way, is a place immortalized in the classic documentary Olympiad, directed by Hitler\u2019s favorite filmmaker (also dancer and actress) Leni Riefenstahl.You can see a sample here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apN5Vg...As you watch it, and enter into the spirit of Ms. Cantrell\u2019s latest book, note the nations who give the Hitlergru\u00df, the Nazi salute, and those who don\u2019t. It might surprise you.Ms. Riefenstahl\u2019s film shows us the Berlin of those days in dim, black and white. Ms. Cantell\u2019s words bring it back in living color \u2013 with sounds and smells attached. Her writing is that vivid.Fans of Philip Kerr\u2019s Bernie Gunther, or David Downing\u2019s John Russell, will love Rebecca Cantrell\u2019s Hannah Vogel.

I had never thought of Berlin in the 30s as a place I'd like to visit for the length of a mystery novel, let alone three, but Hannah's Berlin is almost cozy. She's poor and has been poorer, but she has a sort of ironic optimism, even when awful things keep happening to her.I must admit, I was not happy when the classic right guy who may be wrong shows up, but even with those zinging fingertips so carefully described, she still has most of her attention focused on the 5-year old who materialized on her doorstep quoting an American western narrative. Anton saves Hannah from inhabiting a romance novel, and I was greatly relieved.And then it hit me -- this was Mary Stewart. Mary Stewart in the south of France, where the protagonist befriends a small boy. The hero of a Mary Stewart novel was a young woman who had survived some loss -- death, usually, of a spouse -- and who was venturing out to see some place she'd always wanted to go -- Avignon, Delphi, the Isle of Skye. And Stewart's readers got to go along for the ride. Yes, there was always a guy for that walk into the sunset, but the hero did some of the saving of the day herself.Hannah Vogel is smarter than any of the one-off heros from Stewart's books, but the sense of place and the sense of a woman testing the limits of herself in new situations is very close."}, {"userName": "Myra Rose", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193784-myra-rose", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this installment of the Hannah Vogel mysteries.

She\u2019s been working for the British for a few years, sneaking documents out from her contact and supposed lover, SS Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Lars Lang. But those trips only brought her to Germany for brief weekends and kept her far from her journalist colleagues. Now she has to cover the hottest news item of the day for two weeks and somehow avoid being seen by her old \u201cfriends,\u201d many of whom will turn her in to the Gestapo, who know her as the kidnapper of Nazi leader R\u00f6hm\u2019s young son and a murderer. And that\u2019s only the beginning of her troubles. Old friends die, others betray her\u2014or do they? She\u2019s given up love and safety for this work. Is it worth it? She hopes to undermine the Nazis and awaken the British before it\u2019s too late, but is she actually accomplishing anything? Quite the existential crisis in the midst of terrifying action.Part of what makes Cantrell\u2019s books work so well is that we know how this story comes out in the big picture. We want to tell Hannah to run like hell. You can\u2019t make this a happy story, Hannah. But she can make this a totally absorbing, inspiring story. We step into a specific moment with a heroine we admire, who chooses the right thing\u2014well, most of the time\u2014and history comes alive without overwhelming us. And nothing goes as we would predict no matter how well you know the years leading up to WWII. Except, of course, that the bad guys are really bad and being good takes ungodly amounts of courage. But the bad and the good pop up in such unexpected places. Her first book, A Trace of Smoke, focused frequently on the theme of parenting, both the good and the ugly. In A Game of Lies, in the midst of the Nazis\u2019 giant propaganda machine that was the 1936 Olympic Games, Cantrell raises two thematic questions. Can a person make a worthwhile difference in the midst of gathering evil? What\u2019s worth giving up love and human bonds for? I found the complexity and subtlety of Hannah\u2019s struggles with these questions engaging, thought-provoking and heart-wrenching. The fast-paced action, the beautifully developed characters, and the sharply drawn setting keep you glued to every page, holding your breath, and sending out a little prayer that the people you\u2019ve grown to love make it through."}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44370706-hilary", "userReview": "Once I read \"1936 Berlin\" in the summary, I was pretty much sold (and, I admit, I really enjoyed the cover...). Nazi Germany has always been a source of fascination for me, so I figured I was safe to assume I would devour this book.But the first half was kind of slow for me, to be honest. After realizing it was the third installment in the Vogel series, I wondered if my lack of knowledge about the first two would hinder my understanding of the third, but A Game of Lies references both of them numerous times. This actually made me grateful I picked this one up first because being beaten over the head with \"memories\" from previous novels would have become more aggravating than just hearing about these incessant recollections as I did. And, I mean, I get it - she's had a rough few years and she misses her ex lover Boris and her adopted son Anton back in Switzerland. But don't continue whining about it because you chose to leave them and stay in Germany...The second half really started to grab me and I finished it rather quickly after that. I felt myself fearing (and laughing) for Hannah because of the never-ending dangerous (and awkward) situations she invariably wound up putting herself in, and so desperately wishing she would admit she was in denial about her feelings for Lars - JUST KISS ALREADY DAMMIT! I fell in love with Lars, so naturally I wanted them to be together. Also I found myself continuously grinning like a freakin' idiot at their playful banter. <3Overall I enjoyed the book, especially the ending. It was beautifully written and I think Cantrell captured the strained emotions during that time period wonderfully. The characters are easy to like and the story (eventually - but it's worth it to give it a chance!) sucks you in."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/736266-nikki", "userReview": "Hannah Vogel, crime reporter turned anti-Nazi spy, has been living fairly peacefully in Switzerland for most of the time since we last encountered her in Night of the Long Knives. That is, when she wasn't couriering film out of Nazi Germany, where her contact is a Gestapo officer. In A Game of Lies, Hannah, in her Swiss identity as Adelheid Zinsli, is in Berlin to report on the fencing in the 1936 Olympics. She's also spending a fortnight with her Gestapo contact, Lars Lang, and their cover story is that she's his fiancee -- a story complicated by Lars's obvious attraction to Hannah and her recent breakup with long-time lover Boris. At the opening ceremonies, Hannah has arranged to meet her old friend and mentor Peter Weill. She has barely said hello and learned that Peter has a \"package\" he wants her to smuggle out when he drinks from his pocket flask and promptly dies. This tragedy begins a chain of events which will put Hannah once again in great danger and cause her to question many things in her life.Cantrell's books are always well-researched but never smell of the lamp. The changes in Hannah's old friends,both Jews and \"Aryans,\" as the Nazi regime grows ever more powerful and intrusive, are disturbing both to Hannah and the reader, and seem to give a true flavor of what life was like in 1936.With the London Olympics coming up soon, there will probably be people wanting to read Olympics-themed mysteries. This would be a good one to add to the list.

Now, as the Olympic Games are about to commence in Berlin, Hannah must travel back to Berlin under the alias of Adelheid Zinsli to cover the Games.Leaving Anton in Switzerland with her former lover Boris, Hannah is posing as the fiance of SS Lars Lang, who Hannah has been working with to smuggle information to the British. At the opening of the games, Hannah meets with her old mentor, Peter Weill, who suffers an attack and dies in the stadium. Forceful action from Lars removes Hannah from the scene, but Hannah insists on finding out why Peter wanted to meet with her. As Hannah digs into Peter's work while trying to avoid any reporters that may know her as Hannah, not Adelheid, former friends and foes alike resurface. Hannah is left with no option but to depend on Lars to provide information that may keep her safe. The gap in time between the two books took a bit of adjusting to, but I quickly found myself caught up in the dangerous world of Berlin in 1936. Cantrell does an wonderful job of describing the Berlin presented to the world during that time, as well as showing how many people did what they could to try to prevent the spread of the Nazi's power. Scenes regarding the rightful paranoia and rote behavior by Lars caring for an injured Hannah were especially powerful.

It's been two years since Hannah was last in Germany and since then she has now taken on the role of a secret lover. Posing a Swiss, she is now pretending to be Lars Lang's mistress. In the previous book, Lars saved her life if she agreed to help him bring down the Nazi regime, which had begun to despise. So, die or help Lars, Hannah went with helping Lars. Since then Hannah has also ended her relationship with Boris since he wanted her to stop all this risk taking and start a family, something Hannah has never been big on. They are still friends and Boris is a father figure for Anton. It's now 1936 at the Olympics and while Hannah steps out of the stadium for some air she runs into an old friend. They begin talking but he then dies. Lars gets her out of there before the police can question her. Hannah naturally, again, wants revenge so, despite Lars' protests, goes out to try find the killer. I have to admit, in the first two books I really didn't like Lars. I found him annoying and just not very likable so when I finished the last book, I was worried about Hannah working with Lars. But by half way through the book I decided to like Lars due to the fact that he did have Hannah's best interests in mind and helped her out. So, I was kind of happy when Lars admitted he loved her. I think Hannah does, but she never really admits it in the book. The final result of the man's murder is also good and creative. The book ends with Hannah and Lars leaving Germany together.

Fluent in German, she went to high school and university in Germany, and it is obvious that she has done deep and careful research about life in Nazi Germany.Cantrell writes from Hannah's point of view in the first person, describing Hannah's experiences so vividly that the reader can almost identify with her completely.

I missed seeing Anton and Boris, can understand why she didn't react well to Boris's ultimatum, but it makes me sad. I didn't always like the choices that Hannah made in this book, it seems like she is living in the now and not thinking towards the future.
