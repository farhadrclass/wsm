It's the perfect fall read, a 90s story about vampires that fits perfectly into the niche pre-TWILIGHT vampire cannon. You can easily imagine a Goth adolescent curled up with this book in a pre-commercialized Starbucks while nursing a black Americano as the leaves and rain swirl past the window and Nirvana plays moodily over the speakers.The structure of this book is very odd. It starts out in the \"present\" (1998), before reverting to the mid-40s. We're introduced to a teenage Meghann O'Neal, her loving Irish family, WWII war hero fiance, her hopes, her dreams. She meets a charming man named Simon Baldevar at a party who threatens to sweep her off her feet. She knows she shouldn't spend time with him because she's engaged, but can't seem to help herself. After a night spent painting the town red (pun unintended, actually), Simon declares himself in love with her and all but demands that his feelings be reciprocated.Meghann falls for Simon, and that's when the romance ends and the nightmare begins. Oh, we already know that Simon's a vampire - but did you also know that he's a demented psychopath who likes torture, kink, and human misery? Neither did Meghann. But Simon immediately sets to weaving a web of psychological manipulation and, later, physical abuse, to trap Meghann permanently in his clutches and put her completely under his control. I was shocked at the amount of sexual and physical violence in this book, as well as how uncomfortably convincing the abusive relationship dynamic feels.Back in the \"present\", Meghann is free and in a relationship with a human vampire slayer who also has a bone to pick with Simon. She has friends, a new mentor, and a Simon-sized chip on her shoulder. All of them have their own reasons for wanting Simon dead, but he's far more powerful than any of them had ever dreamed, and the cost of defeating him might be more than they can afford.CRIMSON KISS follows the typical vampire mythos pretty straightforwardly. Dual timelines, Gothic settings, and lots of angst and existential musings create the backdrop and set the scene for CRIMSON. The execution is what causes this book to stand on its own two feet. Simon is a very bad man. The things he did shocked me, and made me sick to my stomach. He is scary. And Baker's very good at deceiving the reader so we get deceived right along with Meghann. This makes it easier to forgive when she falls for his tricks again and again, when she refuses to leave or give up her feelings for her abuser, or when she finds herself giving into him (sigh) yet again.The other characters aren't quite as fleshed out as Meghann and Simon, but I did like Alcuin and Charles a lot. Jimmy, I liked less, but certain events at the end of the book suggest that he might meet with some interesting developments in the sequels. The evil villain and the gloom-and-doom atmosphere are what really drive this story forward, though, and Celtic folklore adds some interesting bells and whistles to the magic in this book. It really is the perfect fall read; I think this would be a great vampire book for October. It's creepy, haunting, and morbid. Plus, it's only $2.99 in the Kindle store - and so is the sequel. I mean, how do you beat that?3.5 to 4 stars!"}, {"userName": "Sammy Loves Books", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14227114-sammy-loves-books", "userReview": "Bodice Ripper, Vampire Style!!!MeghannMeghann was a sweet, innocent girl, until she was swept off her feet by Simon Baldevar. She was a nurse with aspirations to become a doctor. She was sassy and full of life, oh, and beautiful. So beautiful and spunky, that the seven hundred year old vamp in the room couldn't get enough of her. But this is Not a Love Story and there is No Happy Ever After!!Simon BaldevarSimon is not only an old vampire. He is powerful, evil, and feared by all other vamps. And of course, he is too beautiful for words (David Gandy is as close to that description as humanly possible). So Simon sweeps Meghann off her feet, deceives her into believing he is benevolent and loving, when he is actually a Controlling, Sadistic, Evil Monster!!He tortures her, drains her of blood to the point of near death, and violently rapes her whenever she needs to be disciplined. He starves her till near death, only to bring her loved ones to feed from and kill. He teaches her nothing of her vampire powers, leaves her weak, dependent, and mere shell of the vital woman she once was. He can read her thoughts, so she isn't even allowed freedom in her own mind to think negative things about him, for fear she will end up staked to a rooftop, awaiting the morning sun. His does all this while showering her with gifts and adoring her publicly. Hey, a vamp has gotta keep a tight fist on his Consort.I truly hated both the hero and grew to dislike the fickle heroine. Either you love Simon or you don't! But don't have sex with someone that has killed everyone you love, and act as if you were taken over by lust. If someone robbed me of my family and made me drink my previous fianc\u00e9 dry, I wouldn't quiver at his touch.I felt that Meghann would have been content to stay with Simone if he hadn't forced her to kill others, and allowed her the freedom to speak her mind. She was stubborn, immature, and ultimately in denial of how much she loved Simon. Though she preaches hate for Simon throughout the majority of the book, she has sex with him at the first opportunity. Be a woman and admit you love him, but hate his actions! I then, could have enjoyed this book and would have liked the heroine. Oh the manipulation, the torture, the mind games, the hypocrisy, the lackluster sex, and the ANGST!! I hate ANGST!!!I was originally torn between a 1 star or a 2 star. There were parts that I hated mixed with parts that were just ok. This would have been a DNF until a friend encouraged me to finish this book. I will not, however, be continuing the series!!"}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1671402-holly", "userReview": "I read the rave reviews about Trisha Baker's Crimson trilogy and I was intrigued but the price of the books held me off. No way was I paying that much for a set of books! Well, I broke down and finally got them and I must say, I am so glad I did! This book is FANTASTIC!! It starts off with our heroine, Meghann O'Neill who is a psychologist who treats battered women, saying goodbye to the last living person who knew her as the mortal Maggie O'Neill. As she says goodbye to her friend who has not seen her in decades, she envies her her mortal life, the life that ended for her the night she met Simon Baldevar and became a vampire. After thirteen years under his thumb she thought she had left him for dead on the roof of their home, with a poker through his heart and the dawn approaching. She left him and her old life behind that night, working for the next thirty years to atone for the atrocities she had committed while under Simon's influence. Since Simon had not taught her anything, probably fearing she would turn on him and use her powers against him, she had to work to develop her vampiric gifts. Telepathy, telekenesis, the gift of summoning spirits and Druid magic. The magic is particularly strong with her and she is becoming powerful. So powerful in fact, she is now the accepted Priestess for her coven. Life is going pretty good for Meghann O'Neill, until she hears that Simon Baldevar is back. Since she is under the protection of another powerful vampire, Meghann is safe for the time being. In order to get to her, Simon must go around her and through her friends. And he does so. With relish. He steals her lover and tortures him, using his screams to bring her to him. There the two fight each other and their feelings for each other. Feelings that neither one want. She, because he's evil and soulless. He, because she spat on his love and left him for dead. In the midst of their battle, Simon tells Meghann he will leave her alone and walk away forever if only she can tell him that she doesn't love him and mean it. She can't. Some part of her has always loved her master, and will always seek him out. He made her and she will always be a part of him. This book was simply fantastic. Sensational. Amazing. WOW!! I have never read anything this emotional, this deviant, this in depth. Crimson Kiss is as thrilling a vampire romance can get. It is a realistic, gritty, gory and seductive novel that absolutely dragged me in. Simply amazing. The violence of course has to be talked about. You can't talk about Crimson Kiss and not acknowledge it. The violence in this book is probably as sadistic as it can get without turning into snuff. Simon Baldevar has been alive for over four hundred years and in that time, he has hurt and killed a lot of people. Because as he puts it, he needs the diversion. There is no rhyme or reason to his sadistic pleasures. We are given a tiny glimpse into his past, before he was made a vampire, and there are no sad tales of abuse. He is just a cruel person who was given immortality and lived to enjoy it to it's fullest. He is so powerful that other vampires fear him and give him a wide berth, engaging in a kind of Cold War. He meets Meghann O'Neill one night and is fiercely attracted to her. Thinking to use her and kill her, as he has done with all the others, he is bemused when he realizes he doesn't want to kill her. He instead transforms her. Since she is quite young, she is overwhelmed by him and his power over her. He controls her easily, until the inevitable moment comes when she tires of his tyranny and fights back. This is when the beatings start. The descriptions of the abuse is quite horrific. Simon Baldevar is a vicious, cruel man who alternately beats and makes exquisite love to his chosen consort, Meghann. He also heaps devastating emotional abuse on her. Even at the end of the book, when he is trying to regain her love, he is still working his way into her mind. Insidiously, like a snake. I wouldn't trust this vampire as far as I could throw him. Which means never. But despite all that, I absolutely loved this book and Simon. He comes alive across the pages. He is so charismatic and seductive and when he meets Meghann he sweeps her off her feet, the consummate suave gentleman. He even fools her father. I know he is a despicable creature. He is evil, soulless, amoral. Everything about him is vicious. His moods are mercurial and I found myself holding my breath, alongside Meghann, wondering at his next move. I really felt for Meghann as well, her uncertainty and her own disgust when she realizes that despite everything she knows about Simon, she loves him. \"You know what happened last night?\" she asked the fiend rhetorically. \"I had this patient whose husband beats her. Nothing like you of course--no boiling water, no crucifixtions, or dead partners. And I had the nerve to advise her!\" Meghan screamed shrilly at the top of her lungs, tears still pouring down her face. \"The unmitigated gall to tell her that if it was me, I would certainly never love anybody who hurt me or snatched my dignity.\" She cackled, completely hysterical. \"I said it's not love if it makes you miserable.....and that's all you do, Simon Baldevar! My life has been nothing but one miserable episode after another since I met you. That is not love!\" Now she was crying again. \"But if it's not, why do I love you so much? Why can't I say I don't love you and mean it? What the hell is wrong with me? How can I love some sociopath with no conscience? What does that say about me?\" Trisha Baker holds nothing back and makes no apologies. You will either love this book or hate it. I don't think you can be ambivalent about it. This story is continued in the next book by Trisha Baker titled, Crimson Night, which is told through the eyes of Simon. I can't wait to read it."}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68070948-elena", "userReview": "Read for the URR Halloween 2017 Reading Challenge: a romance novel with blood on the cover.This, \nthis\n is what I was looking for when I picked up Blood Destiny! True monsters: yay! Remember when vampires were actually scary - vicious, decadent creatures of the night (and not, like in Tessa Dawn's book, judgy demigods who play vigilantes and waste their immortality away pining over some chick)? Well, here you have it.Trisha Baker isn't playing around - Crimson Blood is a deeply unsettling read, and not because of its violence - I'm actually rather blas\u00e9 when it comes to brutality in fiction so I didn't mind it one bit: what I found really hard to digest is how good she is at putting her readers in Meghann's shoes (definitely not a confortable place to be, FYI), so we, like Meghann, are falling for Simon's schemes over and over again, all the while being fully aware of what his true colors are. Crimson Blood is, first and foremost, the story of an abusive relationship: yes, Simon, is a vampire, but what really defines him is that he\u2019s a cruel, controlling sociopath - one that hung out with Elizabeth I and Shakespeare, dabbled in alchemy and dark magic and has to drink blood to survive, but what takes center stage here is his \u201clove story\u201d with Meghann - and that story is one of abuse. Both Simon and Meghann are fantastically portrayed - a fact which, in the specific instance of this book, where one is the torturer and the other the victim, doesn\u2019t make for an easy read. I found Meghann\u2019s character particularly well-written: you actually see her change from the self-assured, outgoing, na\u00efve (and a little cruel, like many teenagers can be) 18 years old girl living the dream in New York to Simon\u2019s broken, fearsome puppet and, again, to the grown, strong woman we meet at the beginning of the book. Unfortunately Baker doesn\u2019t score as high with her secondary characters, which are merely instrumental to the plot: Jimmy is especially implausible - I couldn\u2019t for a second believe that 1998-Meghann could suffer a dumbass man-child who yells \u201cwhore! cunt!!\u201d at her any time things don\u2019t go his way. It\u2019s a pity because a better fleshed-out character could have given some depth and credibility to the love triangle: as things are is weird enough Simon doesn't simply LOL at the dude and swats him out of his way (and ours: Jimmy really is an insufferable asshole).I also found Simon\u2019s backstory too cartoonishly villanous: it really doesn\u2019t add anything to the character - if anything, I thought it diminished a bit the great work the author did with him up to that point - and what little information we gain from it could have been conveyed differently, BUT!Baker\u2019s slips aside, this was a great read, perfect if you like your vampires to be the fanged stuff of nightmares and not, you know, stalkerish and creepily moody teens. Will I read the rest of the series? Nope. According to Nenia, in #2 and #3 Baker does the one thing that can really screw up a story like this: romanticize Simon. Luckily Crimson Kiss works perfectly as a standalone, so my black little heart is content as it is."}, {"userName": "Raquel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14158760-raquel", "userReview": "Wow, that was defintely intense.

Meghan for 40 years thought that she had killed Simon, and after all this time it turns out he is alive and back for his revenge.The book then jumps to the past in the 1930's when Meghan and Simon meet, and continues on showing us about their relatinoship throughout time until we go back to the present. Some scenes, were on the intense side. Simon was definitely a ruthless bastard , In some parts, he showed us a tiny bit of softer side but mostly he was downright ruthless and perverse. Towards the end, we get a sense of his true feelings towards Meghan. Meghan was a strong character, resilient, and determined. She tries to fight her feelings for Simon.

But maybe we can say that this is a story how people can see love in different ways and is't possible to love true monster.When I say a monster I don't think \"Beauty and the Beast\" monster. It's more like outside-beautiful-inside-ugly monster.And as much as he is a beautiful and a handsome outside, he is three time worse inside. Lord Simon Baldevar doesn't care about who is he going to kill. That could be his own mother and if he got something good from it, he would do it. People of all ages (and yes, I mean ALL) don't mean nothing to him.They are just a way he can gain something. On the other side we have a Meghan O'Neal. Beautiful and unusual girl. She can change from one emotion to another very quickly. Don't can say that I blame her-especially when you know that she lived with Simon.On the beginning of the story you see a Meghan with her mentor (new one) when she learns that Simon is alive. She is very disappointed and very, very in fear. In chapter one story is in past and it's about how mortal Meghan met vampire Simon.I have a lot of emotion about Simon .He is cruel and heartless. You can't love him. Things he is doing in story just made me sick of him and all of men population (second one just for a few hours).But this is one thing with a Simon- he maybe don't care at all about another people, but he loves Meghan. Now the problem is- how can a person how never loved before love now? Well he is not good with showing his love and most of the time he did things to her where even enemy would beg to stop. The worst thing is he don't understand that he is not doing right thing.There is also a Jimmy (didn't like him) and Charles (liked him).I'm very curious how this series is going to end because , be honest, I just don't can imagine happy end (and I DON'T want sad one). Simon is not going to change.Meghan most definitely won't, not again.So how does this ends??"}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8523671-caroline", "userReview": "[I want to skin Simon Baldevar's whole body, salt it and expose it to the sun(if ever that's possible). I just hate...no not just hate but LOATHE and DESPISE every vile and despicable things he did. I want him to be tortured and mutilated before he dies just like what he did to his victims. He's like the 'devil incarnate'...no not just incarnate but he's SATAN HIMSELF that became a vampire. It didn't help that he's very good-looking, preternatural in every sense, described as tall, dark and handsome, the classic, the elegant, the sophisticated, the debonair, charming, mesmerizing, captivating, irresistible, enigmatic...every fucking beautiful description that you can think of to a man, broad shouldered, muscular with dark brown hair and golden amber eyes. I DON'T FUCKING CARE IF HE'S THE MOST GORGEOUS AND THE HOTTEST MAN LIVING ON EARTH well he's not really a 'man', he's a vampire but I still consider him a 'man'. I don't care if he's that outrageously attractive and good-looking and magnetic, how can you love or even like him? he's despicable, sadistic, cruel, ruthless, vile, twisted, SICK and ABSOLUTELY BEYOND EVIL reprobate sonofabitch. I want to inflict him absolute pain and terror the same with how he inflicts them to others....but why does a part of me pities his tormented condemned soul? I kinda pity him and want to show him love and nurturing and how to show it right, there's a part of me that wants to understand that he only just wanted to be loved and nurtured, he's seeking it, I don't know if he's 'really' capable of love but he wants to be loved in return...and it kinda troubles me and makes me despondent.There's actually an 'ironic' moral issue that hit me after discerning deep of Simon Baldevar's character, I'm not condoning or acceding 'gay or same sex relationships or the union and the coupling'. I'm a Christian and I find it sordid and repugnant and it opposes the word of God. Sorry if I'm putting and including this in and I know it's 'out of the topic', it's my review, my opinion, my belief and my moral issue but I'm sighting this as an 'example'. I find myself PREFERRING GAY UNION rather than being the 'eternal partner/lover or consort' of Simon.The.Evil.Fiend. There's no love in him compared to that of a gay relationship.And the beautiful Meghann O'Neill(or O'Neal; really not sure but in the book it says O'Neill WTF!?), with fiery copper-gold hair and light green eyes, she's a beauty that she's not so aware of, yes she knows she's pretty but she doesn't know how beautiful she really is and so going to her terrible and humongous dilemma, I absolutely understand Meghann, if I'm put in the same situation, I may do the same. I'm my own woman, I'm independent, I treasure my freedom and my rights, I hate to be treated like a mindless, robotic, characterless 'slave' and to be ruthlessly and brutally be dominated and punished over and over just because of a minor and insignificant mistake. If that happens to me, I'll surely do the same on what Maggie(Meghann's nickname) did. I'll absolutely defy him every single moment he 'controls' me and absolutely won't care about the consequences and the punishment. But I also understand that she also fears for her life too, nobody wants to die(if you're in your right mind) and if I'm put in the same situation, I can't honestly say with conviction and sincerity that 'I want to die', 'just kill me and end this'...you know nobody really wants that and I'm sure not even me would want it, I might say that 'just kill me' but I know in the back of my mind that I'm not convicted enough, unsure and afraid if he really might do it. So I understand Maggie that even though she treasures her pride and dignity, she really couldn't escape the fact that she's Simon's 'creation' so she has to be submissive and to bow down and ask for forgiveness even though it disgust her and makes her hate herself. But I have to congratulate and applaud her for trying and making and being quite successful...at some time :(Actually, I have a little 'moral issue' with Meghann. I'm not a prude but there was a part in the book that bothered me a little, I think it's the chapter where Jimmy Delacroix and Meghann met for the first time and she's 'looking for someone to get laid with'. I find it a little disconcerting that she's 'getting laid with guys that she just met' or having 'one-night stands' and considering that she also slept once with her 'too mature' professor/thesis consultant. I know everybody 'need and want' sex and it's quite vital and essential to life but I let myself analyze and assess it deeper, perhaps Meghann is 'getting laid' every now and then just to get blood or to be able to feed, that's what I think and that's what I want to believe. And also, the consistent and endless smoking. You know I'm not prude about smoking but I find it unattractive to a woman to smoke IMO.And because everything is that pathetic and miserable. I kinda want to cry while reading the book because of dejection and misery, I know my eyes would glisten with unshed tears while reading it from time to time, my throat will go dry, my chest would constrict. I don't know if Simon really does truly love Meghann or maybe he's just a condescending, self-centered, possessive sociopath and is not use in being turned down and have to get what he wants or perhaps he really has an extremely twisted, sick strange way on how to show his love or possibly I'm right with both. And Meghann loving him or rather finally admitting to herself that she loves him in spite of all the vile and unforgivable things he did and what happened and I'm making myself understand the reason why because maybe of the 'dark' connection between them, the indestructible bond or link, the desire, the lust...the 'blood lust', the relation between master and slave...I don't know, perhaps I'm right, I want to understand her but I find it wretched.I'm not scorning or hating this book, in fact it's one of the most unique and beautiful stories I've ever read, beautiful in a sad and twisted way and I especially like how Ms. Trisha Baker gave each their own stories, character description and history, incorporating it without breaking the story line and the character development. I think it's rare to find an author who does that. I'm still feeling kinda restless and troubled after finishing the book, indeed I'm very excited and I want to jump to the second book of the series and read it immediately and not stopping til' I finish it but I think I do need 'a break' because I still feel despondent after reading it :DI think there was 'some' evidence showing that Simon Baldevar 'loves' Meghann in the epilogue\"Simon actually had tears in his eyes when he said his last words to Meghann. \"I treated you with a tenderness I have never lavished on another. And this is how you repay me? By kicking my love for you away like something vile and nasty you would not deign to touch? You want to fight with the angels, little one? Very well.\"Well there were tears in his eyes isn't there?

I am not going to try to outdo anyone who has reviewed this story before me. These are just my thoughts alone.Story: Meghann O'Neill Cameron is a psychologist who treats battered women. She\u2019s also a vampire who was turned April 1944 by a twisted, and sadistic vampire named Simon Baldevar. When we first meet her, she's saying goodbye to her former best friend Bridie Foster, who is dying of cancer. Bridie begs her to end her suffering, and can't believe that Meg came back for her. After she does so, she flashes back to her earlier meeting with Simon, and how he forced her into becoming a vampire at the tender age of 18. This story tells the story from Meghann's prospective, but done as a third person tale, not POV. Before she was turned, she was a volunteer for the USO, and a softball pitcher who was to be married to Johnny Devlin. Fate, however, intervenes in her plans. While at a party, she meets Simon, who finds himself entranced by her beauty, even though she is 18 years old. Simon ends up luring her into showing her NYC, and before she knows it, she is enthralled by Simon and gets transformed against her will. Later, Johnny ends up on the losing end after she succumbs to her bloodlust after waking as a vampire.After spending 13 years with Simon, she soon meets a strange vampire by the name of Charles, who tells her there is a better way for her to feed on human blood. Simon never showed her any other way but to kill the person you are feeding for, including a certain scene where she drinks from the victims penis. Needless to say, yes, there are some very graphic scenes. Charles tells her that his master Alcuin, would show her a different way to leave.In a a bitter fight, she ends up showing a fireplace poker into Simons chest, and then dragging him to the roof of their building in order for the sun to kill him. (Alas, this is not the end of Simon, but Meg doesn't find that out for another 40 years.) Meg then reunites with her brothers in an emotional farewell, and packs herself into a cargo trunk and transports herself to Ireland.Alcuin is the former bishop of Kent and teaches Meghann all about Telepathy, telekenesis, the gift of summoning spirits and Druid magic. The magic is particularly strong with her and she is becoming powerful. So powerful in fact, she is now the accepted Priestess for her coven. It is later revealed that Simon and Alcuin are related by blood. For nearly 40 years, Meghann has been living free of Simons influence and now as a good practice helping battered women and children. Then, Simon reappears into her life, and everything changes. Alcuin, Charles and her Mentor, tries to save a bleeding Meg, but ends up decapitated instead. Her boyfriend and vampire hunter Jimmy Delacroix, who previously lost his wife and son to a vampire attack, is taken and brutalized by Simon after he tries to stake Simon in his sleep. Meg, herself, ends up right back under the thrall of Simon, and under his guise once again to the point where she and Simon have sex and she ends up pregnant. Yes, vampires in this series can get pregnant. Simon has been trying for awhile now in order to bring about the philospher stone to bear. This book tells the back story of both Meg, and Simon, and how they ended up as vampires. Simons story from the outset is a tale of a very sadistic and power hungry villian. He has no redeeming qualities, except for some reason, he finds he loves Meg. Meg really doesn't have any control over her feelings. Simons blood is in her, and he is her master. He tries to tell her if she can say she doesn't love her (while under a truth serum), then he will leave her alone forever. Not happening. Simon Baldevar is over four hundred years old, and in that time, he has hurt and killed a lot of people, including Isabel, his second wife, and her son. He also turned over 100 people into vampires during the course of his insanity.This book has romance, in a twisted sort of way (call it stockholm syndrome if you like), graphic scenes, and commentary on what happens to the actual characters, especially Jimmy.

What, many would argue, a vampire story should be.How I could love this book so much I do not know. And yet, I could not put this book down. Simon is such a cruel and evil bastard, with page after page describing evil deeds and brutality worse than the ones before them, and still I could not truly hate him. I felt like Meghann at times, when she was trying to understand how it was possible to have such confusing feelings for someone who thrives on nothing but the suffering of others. She never did find the answer, and I couldn't either. The author never once tried to sugarcoat anything Simon did, or attempt to explain any of it away, and yet still I loved his character. For as many times as I wanted them to kill him, I wanted him to be saved. If it was possible, I would say it's almost like this book forced me to develop a strong case of Stockholm syndrome as I'm ever likely to get without actually being held hostage...and involving a fictional character. Maybe I should just call it Simon syndrome."}, {"userName": "mara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19328776-mara", "userReview": "DNF I really hate leaving books unfinished but I really could not stomach this one. I love dark books I really do but sometimes the author has to draw the line. Simon... I liked him at first but after a while he sickened me, I mean between the rapes, abuse towards women (including our protagonist Maggie), his slaughter of innocent children. Forcing women to participate in orgies (once with a dog - may I add) and on top of that threatening to replace the women's child into the sexual act if she did not participate! I couldnt honestly, it was way too much. Now if the author however did go along and had him be the villain all along and had Maggie end with someone better I would not have been this disgusted but it was the romanticisation after, I do not understand how he can be redeemed after all this? And how Maggie was stupid enough to fall back into his arms. Others might enjoy this, it just went beyond my limits (as an avid dark romance reader I found it too extreme). The writing was very good & I found myself enjoying the first few chapters of the book however Simon deserves to be locked up and kept away from people instead of being woobified."}, {"userName": "Sunny Wolfe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33309264-sunny-wolfe", "userReview": "Wow, what can I say? The description gives you all you need to know what the book is about. Of course, the rest is just my opinion.What a book! It is a miracle if you can even get your hands on this book, it is very hard to find and I am very blessed to have a friend to get it to me. BUT - It has been re-released lately!!!!Simon... Oh, Simon is evil, pure evil. Deliciously evil! He is everything that a true vampire is. He does not sparkle. He does not worry about the all the lives he takes. No! He is vampire and hear him roar!!!! Then he fell in love. Simon isn\u2019t going to let love change him, oh no, he will change her! Or at least that is the plan.You shouldn\u2019t love Simon, and then you do. Then he will do something horrible (and I mean horrible) and you think I could never love him again, and then you do. The author did a great job of making me feel like an abused wife. I can see it now - why woman suffer through it. The way a man could beat the crap out of you, and then 5 minutes later he would be crooning his love for you and how it was your fault for me having to teach you a lesson.The author\u2026 I thought she was fantastic. She wrote wonderfully and used adjectives that I had to look up several times. I don\u2019t think she ever used an adjective or noun twice except \u201cparamour\u201d and I only remember that twice because I think it is a pretty word for \u201clover\u201d.The book was never boring. I loved reading it. It is one of my all-time favorites. I am a little scared to read the next in the trilogy because most of the time the first book is perfect without the others but must continue!!!

I was really pumped for what I thought was going to be a dark timeline version of the girl meets vamp cliche and turn it on it's head in a really ironic way. The first 1/3 was really suspenseful when it was setting up for the fall of their romance and Simon's true nature.Where it failed was when it didn't know what to do with the concept once it got there. Simon and Maggie fall into the rut of \"I hate you! I love you! I hate how much I love you!\" battle cry and instead of developing their relationship into anything interesting, relied on summarizing and telling what they felt and endured rather than showing. Also, Maggie was such a hard character to follow as she can't seem to hold onto an emotion or motive for more than a few sentences. I think there was a scene where she was facing the news that her father had passed away without her knowing and it upset her so much she nearly murdered Simon's servant and only a matter of pages later she enjoyed ice cream and cigarettes with Charles. The last couple of chapters were so unbearably inconsistent and meandering that I skimmed to the end, which was a soapy cliffhanger.So three stars for the cool concept and creepy first 1/3, and meh on everything that came after."}, {"userName": "Charlotta", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74337071-charlotta", "userReview": "Well that was bloody brilliant (no pun intended) \ud83d\ude01Simon was such a POS, I loved him!

I can't help that this will contain spoilers so if you don't want to know, don't read it. I'm a huge fan of the Crimson series and I love the main characters- Megahn and Simon. This is the first in a three book series over the fight between Meghan and Simon and their struggle to live together in harmony. Now why would all of this take three series? You'll find out if you read it. Half of this book is a flashback to catch the reader up on what is going on currently. It starts off with Meghan as a vampire entering her old and dying friends room to be there at her bedside. Thinking Meg's an angel she asks that she be taken with her and is helped through a peaceful death. Soon afterward we're introduced (if I remember this correctly. I may have some things out of order) to her best friend and male vampire and her mortal lover. They're told by their mentor and teacher that Meg's Ex (Simon) just may be on the lose and not as dead as Meg had thought. This brings out the explanation that Meg had killed him (or so she thought) years ago. This (if I'm not mistaken) sends us into a very long flashback of how she met, was wooed by Simon and then lived as a vampire. After we're brought up to speed on what happened we come back to them fighting off Simon and Meg alternately saying she loves him and then reviling to hate him with every beat of her heart. Now this isn't her being fickle, well not entirely, but also because she truly does love him and he's her sire so that also adds into the equation. Maybe I need to clarify this- Simon is not only her ex lover and sire but also a complete and utter sociopath with no regards to humans and kills without a second thought and with a lot of relish. He enjoys inflicting pain on others and uses various torturing techniques on Meg whenever she tries to resist him or stand up to him. Now any sane person would hate him and be completely horrified by what he does. I was- but I was also fascinated. Maybe it's a darker part of the human nature that was attracted to Simon- the fact that the societal norms of civilization held very little sway over him. He killed without compunction for his own enjoyment. Meg naturally loathed that in him and fought her desires to him because of it. So this book is really about how Simon comes back after healing a very nasty chest wound that Meg accidentally gives him one night to get revenge. After killing her mentor and basically ripping up her mortal lover to leave him with nearly fatal wounds he finds that he can't kill her since he loves her so much and takes her to his lair where he drugs her and has sex with her to get her pregnant using a nifty little ceremony and spell. To make a long story short he torments her friends and her lover with the thought that she really does love him despite all the things he's done by having her admit it out loud to them. They get the drop on him and have him by the short hairs but she can't kill him and he brings down a shit storm on their heads, takes her lover and end scene after she's sitting in an apartment and finding she's preggers. I had a few problems with this book. First off was the relationship she had with Jimmy (her mortal lover). I know that it was meant to be but I really dislike Jimmy. Not only is he a drunk but he has the craziest mood swings ever and it makes me think that everyone except her bestie (the male vamp- forgot his name) needs some psychological help. She's mostly with him because she was attracted to what Simon is and a part of her wants to be that way. She actually lived like Simon for a few years until she was shown she didn't have to kill so it brought back all that Catholic guilt onto her head again. I hate what Simon is- naturally- but he makes an excellent \"villain\" for this story. I mean he is what most people really envision a vampire to really be- a killer plain and simple. He doesn't mince words and doesn't agonize over his fate at being the undead and having to drink blood and possibly kill to do so. No he revels in it and teaches that same blood lust to Meghan. I liked that he didn't give an excuse for what he was. He just is a killer. Maybe that makes me a little weird but I hate emo villains or emo vampires. Meg did enough emo for everyone combined. Something that was also a bit different from normal vamp books was that the heroine is in love with the villain of the piece! I keep trying to remember how many books are like that nowadays. You usually have the bad guy, heroine and the hot mysterious supporting male lead that helps kill the bad guy. Rarely do you have the heroine agonizing over her love for the bad guy. Makes an interesting story to say the least. Now all of that may have sounded convoluted- that's just the way that I think on a daily basis so you're gonna have to deal- but I hope it helped in some way. I doubt it but I can hope. But if you take nothing else from this review just know that you're either going to love it or you're going to hate it- no in between. It's too extreme for such a mild reaction in my opinion but that's just my opinion. Beware: Graphic scenes of violence, blood, sex, rape, bondage, etc. Very Dark and twisted storyline/vampire romance."}, {"userName": "Liana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3188320-liana", "userReview": "Please welcome the magnificent, nineties love child of \"Lost Souls\" and \"Twilight\" as raised by Lestat. Maybe that flavor profile of crack fiction and cock-biting with a dash of Eurpean aristocracy doesn't shout your name, but it does mine. And hard.Our heroine, Meghann, despite her fifties transformation as an adolescent and a Stockholm-shepherding into the world of the undead by her abuser-cum-maker-cum-lover, turns out to be super cool by '97. She uses her experiences on the dark side of the force to become a psychologist and domestic violence counselor (if only Bella Swann or Anna Steele had the self-awareness to withstand such a transition!) and indulges in Lucky Strikes, \"punk rock, Good-fellas, and the writings of Charles Bukowski.\" Our hero is the worst sort of alpha-asshole-sadist (safe-words be damned) that can only exist and wet the palette in the realm of fiction, but Meghann and us readers are woke enough to understand the abusive ramifications of his cruelty even as we bend to his appeal. And a vampire determined not to reform is far more interesting than one obsessed by guilt and repentance; It is good to see Simon Baldevar in the front seat. The second novel seems to be a \"The Vampire Lestat\"-like revision from the evil Simon's POV, and I'm eager to catch a glimpse of his inner workings or re-remembrances.Deducting a star for the ridiculous number of flashbacks, because this isn't a sh\u014dnen battle anime and we don't need one every ten minutes to beef up an uninteresting plot. Would dock another star for unoriginality if it wasn't authored twenty years ago, preceding and mocking all the paranormal romances since. Shall we see how this tale holds up as a trilogy?

This book was released in 2001. It\u2019s violent and bloody a far cry from stereotypical vampire romance you read today. My only issue is the method in which the author chose to develop the plot of the story. Instead of being immersed in the moments with the characters things are sometimes told in synopsis styled flashbacks. Time passes and then things are explained later. I would much rather read the action as its happening not have someone wake up somewhere then be told what happened in a few paragraphs. I enjoyed the book overall. It was entertaining. It was both sexy and grotesque.As much as I liked this book it is very hard to find. It is out of print and extremely expensive.
