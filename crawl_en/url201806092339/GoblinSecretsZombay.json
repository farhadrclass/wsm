I don't find many fantasy that mixes goblins and steampunk and this worked great. A fresh mix. Good plot, great characters, interesting story all around. The best of both worlds mixed and mashed into something really special in this magical world. Loved it.

There is a witch with clockwork legs called Graba who collects orphaned children to do her bidding and whose youngest charge is a boy named Rownie. Rownie has no name of his own, having inherited the diminutive form of his older brother\u2019s name, Rowan, who disappeared without a trace.In the land of Zombay, you can\u2019t pretend to be what you aren\u2019t so theatre and acting are outlawed. Everybody looks down at Goblins too but that doesn\u2019t stop Rownie from joining a theatre troupe of Goblins \u2013 perhaps they will help him find Rowan. Perhaps, he will become a great actor.In the land of Zombay, there is a flood coming.Goblin Secrets is a weird animal. It is not a bad book but it left me wholly underwhelmed. It has several aspects that commend it: competent writing, an endearing (if not completely original) main character and the premise itself.In fact, at first glance, Goblin Secrets is a book filled with incredible ideas, all taking inspiration from different genres. There is the Steampunk-ish world of automata; the Fantasy world of witches and magic; masks that imbue whomever wears them with a sense of power and sometimes even with a different identity. There are fairytale elements and Graba definitely comes across as a Baba Yaga figure but in a way, reminiscent of Dickens\u2019 Fagin as well. There is a prophecy (the one that predicts that the Flood is Coming) and also a Quest which our hero undertakes as he seeks for his brother. There is even social commentary as the Goblins are not considered citizens and as such officially don\u2019t belong in Zombay even though it is their home.But all of these ideas and commentary are kind of thrown in there and the end result is disjointed, as these things actually never mesh together to form a cohesive whole. The Steampunk elements are just\u2026there without any real explanation or impact in the storyline beyond the cool imagery. Animal hearts are turned into coal to fuel things (Why? How? Is this\u2026magic? Or science?). And so on and so forth.The story progresses as a series of almost episodic events; the first half is slow-moving, the second half rushed toward a confusing, unpolished ending. Put simply, there is the skeleton of a good idea here but it needed more: more meat and blood and heart to make it really come alive for me.At the end of the day, I am puzzled. Whilst there are definitely interesting things about Goblin Secrets, to be completely honest I don\u2019t quite see why it has been nominated for the National Book Award."}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221050-betsy", "userReview": "I think it is time to declare the birth of the clockwork children's novel. If you have been watching the literary trends over the last decade or so, you will note that amongst adults there has been a real rise in interest in a form of pop culture labeled \"Steampunk\". The general understanding is that as the 21st century grows increasingly reliant on electronics, there is a newfound interest in books/movies/video games/costumes (etc.) that incorporate steam, gears, and other accoutrements of the visual mechanical past. This is, I should note, almost exclusively an adult fascination. I have never encountered a single child who walked up to a reference desk and asked, \"Do you have any more Steampunk?\" That said, there's no reason it shouldn't work as a genre. The trouble comes when an author tries to shoehorn a Steampunk story into a fantasy mold. The best writers know that if you're going to incorporate odd mechanical details, the best thing to do is to set up your own odd mechanical internal logic. I think that's probably what I like best about William Alexander's \"Goblin Secrets\". It's not the first story I've read about a boy joining a troupe of traveling performers. And it's not the first middle grade Steampunk adventure I've come across. Yet there's something definitely one-of-a-kind going on in this book. An originality that you only find once in a pure blue moon. And that's worth reading, you betcha.Rownie's life hasn't been worth much since the disappearance of his older brother Rowan. Living with \"grandmother\", an old witch named Graba who holds a Fagan-like power over the orphans in her sway, Rownie runs various errands until one day he finds that goblins have come to his city of Zombay. They are conducting theatrical performances, an act forbidden to humans, so it's as much a surprise to Rownie as to anyone when he joins their little troupe. Rownie is also still determined to track Rowan down, but that may mean using extraordinary means to escape from Graba's all-knowing, all-seeing ways.It's little wonder that the book was nominated for a National Book Award when you take into account the writing. In terms of description, the book has a wonderful and well-developed sense of place. At one point this is what you read, \"All roads to the docks ran downhill. They wound and switchbacked across a steep ravine wall, with Southside above and the River below. Some of these streets were so steep narrow that they had to be climbed rather than walked on. Stairs had been cut into the stone or built with driftwood logs lashed together over the precarious slope.\" With a minimal amount of words you get a clear sense of the location, its look, its feel, its dangers, and perhaps its beauties as well.The details found within this strange Steampunk world are delicious, and that is in the book's favor. You hear about \"small and cunning devices that did useless things beautifully.\" From gears in mechanical glass eyes to the fact that a river is something that can be bargained with, there's an internal logic at work here that is consistent, even if Alexander is going to leave the learning of these rules up to the reader with minimal help. For example, there is the small matter of hearts and their removal. To take out a heart is not a death sentence for a person, but it can leave them somewhat zombiefied (the city's name \"Zombay\" could just be a coincidence or could not, depending on how you want to look at it). And goblins aren't born but are changed humans. Why are they changed and for what reason? That's a story for another day, but you're willing to wait for an answer (if answer there ever is).Exposition. It can be a death knoll in a book for kids. Done well it sucks the reader into an alternate world the like of which they may never have seen before. Done poorly they fall asleep three pages in and you've lost them forever. And done not at all? That's a risk but done right it pays off in fine dividends. \"Goblin Secrets\" takes place in Zombay, a fact you find out five pages in. It's a city that contains magic, a fact you find out on page three. There are goblins in this world (page twelve) but they didn't start out as goblins (page . . . um . . .). Facts are doled out at a deliberate but unexpected pace in this book. There are no long paragraphs of explanation that tell you where you are and what to expect. It's only by reading the story thoroughly that you learn that theater is forbidden, Rownie's brother is missing, Graba is relentless (but not the only villain in the story), and masks are the book's overriding theme. In the interest of brevity Alexander manages to avoid exposition with something resembling long years of practice. Little wonder that he's published in multiple magazines and anthologies on the adult fantasy (not that kind) side of things. Many is the adult writer who switches to writing for children that dumbs down the narrative, giving too little respect to the young audience. I think Mr. Alexander's gift here is that he respects his younger readers enough to grant them enough intelligence to follow along.Alexander makes his own rules with this book, and not rules I've necessarily seen before. With that in mind, with as weird a setting as you have here, it can be a relief to run across characters you like and identify with. They act as little touchstones in a mad, crazy world. Rownie is particularly sympathetic right from the get-go. He has a missed beloved older brother, an independence that's appealing, but he's not a jerk or anything. Nor is he a walking blank slate that more interesting characters can use to their own ends. Rather, Rownie is the kind of character who keeps trying to talk himself into bravery. He does it when performing and he does it on his own (\"Rownie tried to summon up the feeling that he was haunting the Southside Rail Station and that other sorts of haunting things should be afraid of him...\"). That's why Alexander's use of masks and theater is so effective. If you have a protagonist who just needs a little push to reach his potential, what better way than through performance? On the flipside, the bad guys are nice, if perhaps a little two-dimensional. Graba is nothing so much as a clockwork Baba Yaga, mechanical chicken legs and all. By extension the Mayor is a good power hungry villain, if stock and staid. There is no big bad in this book quite worthy of the good folks they face down. Graba comes close, but she's just your typical witch when all is said and done. A little gearish. A little creaky. But typically witchy, through and through.By turns beautiful and original, it's a testament to Alexander's skills that the book clocks in at a mere 200-some odd pages. Usually worlds of this sort end up in books with five hundred or six hundred pages. The end result is that when a kid is looking for a good fantasy in a new world, they are inclined to be scared off by the thick tomes gathering dust on library shelves and instead will find friends in old classics like The Black Cauldron or The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Add to that list William Alexander's latest then. A smart piece of writing that conjures up a new world using a new method.For ages 9-12."}, {"userName": "Barb Middleton", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton", "userReview": "I struggled with this National Book Award winner. Not because it lacks originality. The creepy steampunk setting with gear-transformed people, witches, and goblins was well done. Not because it lacked character development. The weird witch, river spirit, goblins, and orphans with a plucky protagonist were engaging enough. And not because of a plot that plods. The 200 page book is concise and clues are slowly revealed. It was unpredictable and imaginative. So why couldn't I immerse myself in the story?It wasn't a complete loss - I loved the witch Graba, patterned after the fairy tale witch Baba Yaga in Russian folklore with her unpredictable temperament and dangerous ways. In this tale, it is not the house, but the witch herself who lunges around on giant chicken legs made of gears and metal using monstrous talons to grab wayward children. What a great twist on the original! Speaking of twists... Graba gives Rownie a home with food but he is mistreated like the other orphans she takes into her home that echos characteristics found in Oliver Twist's Fagin. Machinery has replaced human parts in the city of Zombay; the police have glass eyes with gears for irises and the animals have coal hearts. Graba has taken in Rownie and his brother, Rowan, but Rowan has disappeared. Rownie joins the goblin theater troupe because they are searching for Rowan. The goblins need Rowan to speak to the river and prevent the flood that threatens the city of Zombay; however, the goblins are not welcome in the city and it is illegal to put on their show which results in all sorts of trouble for the troupe. Rownie combines forces with them only to get caught up in a bigger struggle for power between the goblins, mayor, and witch Graba.The story is filled with terrific themes from the magic or imagination that comes from within when assuming the identity of a mask to the magic or power that comes from without as symbolized in the witches, mayor, and river spirit; to the social commentary of the goblins being prejudiced by the townspeople; to the humans who can't wear masks to act in plays because it changes them, and more. While there are so many social commentaries, the storyline never stops long enough to explore them. I wanted more of an explanation about the goblin play where the witch uses her reflection to create a bunch of mini-me's who become her slaves; followed by her cooking the heart of one and causing a rebellion. Was this play a suggestion that the witch Graba and Semele were like the rebellious slaves? What is their background? And what about Rowan. Is he with his mother? Why can he wear a mask? How do humans change into goblins? In the end I felt dissatisfied with the overall book and the lack of answers.The lack of exposition resulted in me going back and rereading passages often and being confused in spots. You really had to figure out the plot as you read along and be patient as the clues unfolded. I kept thinking I missed something but my question would be answered later. As mentioned earlier, not that all questions are answered; you have to come up with your own analysis. I sort of twitched and sputtered through the narrative which never came alive for me. Some spots were jarring or awkward, such as when the characters put on masks and adopted its qualities or when Rownie would think to himself. While not something I noticed all the time, I ended with a disjointed feeling like my gears were malfunctioning. This is a book that I should really reread. I read that the author has a sequel. Most likely some of my questions will be answered. An interesting read.Reading level 4.3"}, {"userName": "Isabel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12923518-isabel", "userReview": "Like many other reviewers, I picked up this book after it was given the National Book Award and was eager to get started with it. However, I was met with a very disappointing read. The plot has some interesting promise -- a steampunk world, goblins, theater and beautifully described masks, as well as a Baba Yaga-esque villain -- the story, setting, and characters all fell flat. While some elements of the story were compelling, including the use of interesting machinery and the imminent danger of the flooding river, many of the books story arcs felt rushed and underdeveloped. Most disappointing of all is the protagonist, Rownie, whose search for his missing brother and efforts to gain self-confidence are brought to an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion. Although the plot moves with Rownie's attempts and desires to stand up to his adversaries through skills learned on the stage, Rownie never truly comes alive as a character and his role in the goblin's theater troupe seems minimal. Similarly, the goblins, who play a large role, feel one dimensional and never seem to emerge as distinct or memorable characters.The multiple story lines and lack of exposition also make this a somewhat confusing read. The characters jump from place to place, but never make any lasting interpretations of difficult themes. Likewise, many questions, including the use of human hearts as coal, the social divisions and conflicts between Zombay's Northside and Southside, or the importance of the Changed versus the unChanged, are left frustratingly unanswered. And despite the time spent on different set pieces within the story, many of the events don't seem to have a lasting impression on the characters or tie back into the story later. The tropes and devices used in this book often lack a cohesion that would allow them to benefit the story or characters as a whole.Overall, this book starts with the potential of a fantasy adventure, but the underdevelopment of key characters and themes, as well as an ill-paced plot lead Goblin Secrets to be an unsatisfying read.If you are looking for a more effective book in this genre, I would suggest Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123475-jim", "userReview": "One of the things I liked about this book was that the author didn't spend a lot of time on backstory or hand-holding to explain the worldbuilding. You jump right into Rownie's story, picking up details as you go, from the clockwork guards to the mythology of the River to the layout and struggles of the split town. I've seen a few reviews that complained this was confusing, but I didn't have a problem with it. I really enjoyed the worldbuilding, and the thought Alexander had put into the magic and history. You can skim the book and still appreciate the story, but you'll get a lot more out of it if you read more closely.The different types of magic felt original and interesting, from the masks to Graba's curses to the coal used to power various automatons. I also appreciated the role and personalities of the goblins, all of whom felt distinctive and real and interesting.At its heart, the plot is pretty straightforward and self-contained. What's interesting to me is that I think one of the reasons it works so well is everything Alexander doesn't say, in addition to the things he does. He drops hints and suggestions, and the reader fills in the rest. It's an impressive balancing act.There are a few scenes that are genuinely dark and disturbing in that old-school fairy tale way, but they feel right for the book.

Say with The Penderwicks, I didn't think it was the best book of the year but at least I could identify some things it was doing that other books weren't doing, so I saw why it had come to the award's attention. This one, I can't. Unless it's the occasional commentary on the dangers of using coal, which is topical? Fantasy coal, made of human hearts (this was my favorite aspect of the book), but certainly coal--unthinkable to use such a thing merely for heating one's house.

A young boy named Rownie (a variation of Rowan) is the main focus of the book. Rownie has run away from his \"grandmother\" Grabba, in search of his older brother, his only actual who has run away with an acting troupe in an area where acting is illegal. Now that the great flood is on it's way, Rownie has joined an acting troupe of goblins himself in search of his older brother, whom he is trying to locate and save.To be honest, this was probably one of my favorite books to read. The first thing that I really enjoyed about this book was how it jumped directly into the storyline of Rownie, and explained everything from the start. It directly told the reader who Rownie was, who he lived with, what he was like, and his problems, all from the start. Another thing that I enjoyed was how the author inserted flashbacks of Rownie's memory. They provided amusing, and comical insight to Rownie's life. Another aspect that I enjoyed about this book was how the author introduced and showed character development to the reader. Although this book was good, it was far from perfect. One of the mistakes that the author made in the book was the quickly-paced scenes. At times, they made the book difficult to understand at times because of illogical time lapses (excluding flashbacks). Another thing that wasn't so enjoyable about this book was its over-explanations of simple things. For example, descriptions of Grabba, and all of her oddities were spurred upon a bit too much for my liking, and it was a little insulting as a reader.Despite the lack of quickly-paced scenes, illogical time lapses, this novel was a joy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, fiction, science fiction, and magic. I plan on reading more novels by William Alexander soon, and reviewing them as well. William Alexander gets a pat on the back for this one though.

So I picked this up after I put my last book down and thought \"oh, a goblin book. I really don't like goblins . . . and goblin books tend to be full of comic scenes and gross stuff. Sigh.\"It's so nice to be knocked on my proverbial butt for making a judgement based on a title. It restores my faith in books and writing. Goblin Secrets takes place in the city of Zombay, a place strange and oppressive where masks and plays are not allowed and only goblins may perform. A place where gears and mechanical devices combine with magic and curses and witchery. The orphan Rownie lives in this town, running errands for the woman who cares for him and the odd and end other orphans in her home. Until the day he sees the goblins perform a play, and runs away to join them, hoping to find his lost brother and find out who he is. But other forces are chasing him, and a time is coming soon where Rownie will have to act in order to save the city and discover the person he is meant to be.William Alexander plunges readers into his magical urbanesque environment with no apologies or explanations. It's a tightly told story with suspense and magic and evocative descriptions. The world building is superbly done, painting a unique picture of this landscape. Unlike some stories that take the grand scale fantasy world and give readers a panoramic view, this story remains seated in one city and the rise and fall of that city and its denizens. I'm not certain if Alexander intends to explore this world further, since this book is a satisfying stand-alone, but I'd be happy to dive in if he so decides.Just marvelous fun, great imagination and something I wasn't expecting--which will keep me humble!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2179816-sarah", "userReview": "After reading rave reviews about this 2012 National Book Award winner, I was stoked to read a title that was a little dark and twisted with a fantasy/steampunk twist. Due, perhaps, to such high expectations, I found it challenging to fully immerse myself in the tale. The numerous odd names introduced in the first chapters as I struggled to get my bearings in the strange land also lent an air of Tolkien confusion. Soon, however, the story morphed into a rather plot line of traditional orphaned waif leaves the relative security of his neglectful home for adventures and eventual saving of the world, all be it in a rather unusual scenario and with some delightful dialogue from classically trained goblin actors. Parents, take note, while this is a solid story well told, some tweens may find the Dark Crystal like soul stealing antics a bit hard to stomach, while others will find that hint of scariness thrilling. Overall, I'm interested enough to try the second title... as long as the Goblin troupe makes an appearance.*This review is based on the audio book version.

There are lots of things to admire in \u2018Goblin Secrets\u2019, not least of which is William Alexander\u2019s facility with language \u2013 he can write, and he can write well. His sentences are poetic and rhythmical, his images are arresting, and I loved the way he divided up the book into scenes and acts, instead of chapters. I loved the touches of steampunk in here \u2013 the automata, the mechanical legs that Graba uses \u2013 and I loved, too, the hints at deeper themes we find in the way Alexander portrays the goblins. They were once human, but have \u2018Changed\u2019; they are not technically citizens of Zombay, the city in which the book is set (despite living there), so they are not given the same rights and privileges as the unChanged (i.e. humans), and eke out a lesser existence. There\u2019s a lot packed into this in relation to social class and racism, and the horror of prejudice \u2013 but it\u2019s never unpacked. We\u2019re never told how or why they Change, for instance, which I thought was a big omission. There is a Northside (clean and ordered) and a Southside (disordered and underprivileged) to Zombay, and a bridge across its vast river which is a \u2018neutral ground\u2019 between the two halves of the city. All these ideas are great, but you might have noticed me using the words \u2018hints\u2019 and \u2018touches\u2019 above \u2013 all we ever get are hints and touches in this infuriatingly underdeveloped book.The story is based around the theatre, taking as its premise the idea that acting and performing are illegal in Zombay, where Rownie, an orphan, lives under the \u2018guardianship\u2019 of a witch named Graba. A very clear mix between the Baba Yaga of Russian folklore and the self-interested survivor Fagin from Dicken\u2019s \u2018Oliver Twist\u2019, Graba uses, rather than protects, the orphans who live under her charge. One day, a troupe of goblin actors (who are not governed by the same laws as the unChanged humans, and so do not have to abide by the ban on acting) announces they are putting on a play \u2013 so, of course, Rownie attends, and of course he ends up becoming absorbed into the troupe. This is not only because of Rownie\u2019s own fascination with the outlawed art of acting, but because he hopes the goblin troupe will help him find his missing brother Rowan, who also had an interest in the theatre. Masks, in the world of Zombay, have a strange power \u2013 at times, they become \u2018alive\u2019, imbuing their wearer with some of that power and infusing them with whatever emotion the mask depicts \u2013 and this is one of the reasons why performance is dangerous and outlawed. Rownie, and Rowan before him, have some sort of affinity with the masks, and Rowan seems to possess an indistinct and undefinable power over the river which runs through Zombay.So. We have a boy searching for his brother. We have mystery surrounding the theatre and its power. We have cool ideas such as animal hearts being used as a source of fuel for the mechanical \u2018people\u2019 who live in Zombay (why wasn\u2019t more made of this?!). We have the possibility of great characters in figures like Graba. But the book is like a fledgling bird who just isn\u2019t brave enough to take the big bad jump into the brave new world. It has so much potential to be fantastic, but it never lives up to its own promise. I can\u2019t tell you how often I stopped, confused, while reading this book and flipped back a few pages to check whether I\u2019d skipped or missed something, or misunderstood a vital plot point. I hadn\u2019t. It was just that stuff wasn\u2019t explained properly, and wasn\u2019t elaborated upon in enough detail. I know you\u2019re not supposed to be overly wordy, and brevity is king (particularly in books for the 8+ age group), but it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of plot, or characterisation.Speaking of characterisation \u2013 that\u2019s a problem here, too. I never got a sense of who Rownie was, and I particularly never got a handle on Rowan. Some of the goblin characters could have been interesting, but we never got a chance to really meet them. I don\u2019t know about you, but if I can\u2019t get a feel for the protagonist of a book, I find it hard to warm to the book. I couldn\u2019t get a feel for Rownie.I was also completely blindsided (not in a good way) by the plot, which seemed, to me, to change direction without warning at the end of the book. Not a lot happens besides Rownie spending time with the goblins for ages, and then in the last few pages, suddenly the whole world of Zombay is under threat and only the boys can save it, etc. Perhaps I missed something \u2013 perhaps my attention wandered and I lost some of the plot. But perhaps I didn\u2019t.So, in short, \u2018Goblin Secrets\u2019 is a beautifully written book (and its author seems to be a wonderfully nice man, too, if his blog is anything to go by), but I just can\u2019t shake the feeling that it could have been so much more than it is.For more reviews, and lots of other kidlit/YA related stuff, why not check out my blog? http://sjohart.wordpress.com."}, {"userName": "Aidan Jones", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35527632-aidan-jones", "userReview": "This is an okay book.

Graba.Tras solo pasar unas p\u00e1ginas y adentrarme en los primeros cap\u00edtulos pude darme cuenta del halo de misterio que envuelve esta historia, como una espesa niebla. Este misterio nos acompa\u00f1a durante todo el libro, pues la magia que vamos hallando a medida que avanzamos en \u00e9l no es una magia cualquiera. No hay varitas, ni hechizos, ni encantamientos, ni objetos m\u00e1gicos. Hay maldiciones, entes, m\u00e1scaras con voluntad propia, carb\u00f3n... y Cambios.Si sab\u00e9is qui\u00e9n es Baba Yaga os gustar\u00e1 leer esta historia. Para m\u00ed fue una sorpresa ir leyendo y descubrir la conexi\u00f3n entre Graba, la bruja que \"cuida de los ni\u00f1os sin hogar\" y descubrir su origen en las aclaraciones del libro. Cuando era peque\u00f1a le\u00eda cuentos sobre Baba Yaga, la temible bruja del norte, con los dientes de hierro y una pierna de hueso, cuya casa de piedra ten\u00eda largas patas de pollo que se alzaban en el cielo y pod\u00edan transportarla a cualquier lugar. Incluso hay una divertida pel\u00edcula de animaci\u00f3n \"Bartok el magn\u00edfico\" que trata sobre esta bruja. Graba tambi\u00e9n es una horrible bruja, con una pierna de hierro, una casa m\u00f3vil y una peligrosa lengua capaz de lanzar las m\u00e1s temibles maldiciones. A Rownie lo tiene atrapado junto a los dem\u00e1s chicos que trabajan para ella. Rownie la teme y no desea convertirse en un t\u00edtere m\u00e1s de Graba, por esa raz\u00f3n decide escapar y esconderse, as\u00ed es como llega hasta los Duendes, con la ayuda de estas misteriosas criaturas tal vez pueda encontrar a su hermano mayor e irse con \u00e9l de Zombay.El libro est\u00e1 dividido en tres actos, simulando una gran representaci\u00f3n esc\u00e9nica, como hacen los Duendes actores, con sus m\u00e1scaras. Narrado en tercera persona y siempre desde la perspectiva de Rownie, nuestro protagonista, seremos testigos de c\u00f3mo este chico deja atr\u00e1s su miedo para enfrentarse a los mayores peligros, con el objetivo de encontrar por fin a su hermano.A lo largo de la historia encontraremos mucha acci\u00f3n. No he podido evitar devorarlo r\u00e1pidamente, entre escenas de acci\u00f3n, persecuciones, hu\u00eddas y luchas, tambi\u00e9n encontraremos momentos para la magia y el misterio, la amistad y el compa\u00f1erismo. La ambientaci\u00f3n es, adem\u00e1s, uno de los elementos de los que m\u00e1s he disfrutado. El autor crea un fant\u00e1stico escenario entre las calles de Zombay, sus afueras y los oscuros Subterr\u00e1neos bajo la ciudad. Los secretos de los duendes posee todos los ingredientes para una lectura inolvidable y hechizante.Sin duda mis personajes favoritos han sido Graba y los Duendes, con sus grandiosas M\u00e1scaras. Al conocerlos a ellos no me ha quedado duda alguna de que yo formar\u00eda parte de ellos, con sus peligros y sus aventuras.Si os gustan las historias cargadas de misterio y magia os recomiendo esta original novela, aunque est\u00e9 dedicada a un p\u00fablico m\u00e1s juvenil, yo la he disfrutado much\u00edsimo y creo que tambi\u00e9n os gustar\u00e1. Dejaos llevar por las M\u00e1scaras de Zombay."}, {"userName": "May", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20416955-may", "userReview": "Los secretos de los duendes es una novela entre infantil y juvenil que han le\u00eddo much\u00edsimos adultos por la historia que hay entre sus p\u00e1ginas. Es una novela de la que no hab\u00eda escuchado nada y que cog\u00ed con muchas ganas, esperaba de ella que fuera tierna y especial. Y para las pocas veces que acierto con esta novela lo hice de lleno.Sin duda as\u00ed tengo que empezar a caracterizar a esta historia, tierna y dulce. Es una historia contada por un ni\u00f1o muy inocente que va desvelando sus sue\u00f1os e ilusiones p\u00e1gina tras p\u00e1gina. Me ha encantado el protagonista de la historia porque es so\u00f1ador y fantasioso.La novela se desarrolla en un entorno ficticio y fantasioso que veo muy bueno para los ni\u00f1os que disfrutan de novelas de fantas\u00eda. El ambiente me gust\u00f3 mucho, la manera en la que se ve a los duendes en la historia, la forma en la que el protagonista se relaciona con ellos... En s\u00ed para m\u00ed los duendes fueron el punto fuerte de la historia.El ritmo de la historia es muy r\u00e1pido, el protagonista va movi\u00e9ndose y van ocurri\u00e9ndole muchas cosas unas tras otras. Los personajes son entra\u00f1ables, los duendes son todos distintos y especiales, todos tienen algo diferente y a todos se les coge cari\u00f1o.Adem\u00e1s la novela tiene una edici\u00f3n preciosa, los inicios de cap\u00edtulos vienen acompa\u00f1ados de peque\u00f1as ilustraciones y la tapa de la novela es dura y de calidad.Por otro lado no considero que Los secretos de los duendes sea una novela para un p\u00fablico juvenil adulto, como es mi caso. No lo considero porque es demasiado simple y f\u00e1cil, est\u00e1 preparada para ser le\u00edda por ni\u00f1os y por eso mismo no cuadr\u00f3 del todo conmigo.Sin embargo, eso no quiere decir que Los secretos de los duendes no sea una buena novela. Al contrario, bajo mi punto de vista Los secretos de los duendes es una novela perfecta para ni\u00f1os, una novela que los har\u00e1 so\u00f1ar y que los meter\u00e1 de lleno en un mundo de duendes en el que podr\u00e1n perderse. Es una novela que a m\u00ed me hubiera encantado leer de ni\u00f1a, que tiene una historia bonita y entra\u00f1able a la que cualquier lector le coger\u00e1 much\u00edsimo cari\u00f1o."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136210-melanie", "userReview": "Rownie, a young orphan boy cannot seem to find his brother anywhere. The mystery is, why are so many people looking for him? Rownie's \"Grandmother\" Grabba, with her robotic chicken legs has housed Rownie and other orphan kids so long as the run errands for her. She is the town witch, and seems to actually posses her children on some of their errands. (um yeah, that's creepy) not only that, but there are performing Goblins who skate around the town's laws forbidding mask wearing and performing because they aren't considered citizens anymore- even though they have been in the town of Zombay longer than anyone. The Goblins seem nice, and have promised not to change Rownie into one of them... yet. Add to that a mysterious mayor and you have trouble. Everyone wants to find Rownie's brother, and he isn't sure who to trust.I would actually give this more like a 3.5 star rating. The story is interesting, but for me it was a little bit too creepy. Specifically the use of many curses and masks that actually change the person wearing them. Maybe Dark would be a better word than creepy, as it isn't scary in the traditional sense. I admit I am sensitive to that kind of thing, so my rating is lower than perhaps the writing deserves. The other thing that differentiates it from some other kids books with possession is, no one is really \"evil\" in the traditional sense. the bad guys aren't all that bad, which makes it unique but also sort of dangerous in my mind. The town is interesting... the half human half robot thing is also interesting. I just couldn't get past the darker elements. This book did win the National Book award for 2012... but I think there are better ones out there."}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4362439-gail", "userReview": "I picked this book up to read based on the fact that it was a winner of an award. I like fantasy and so I thought it sounded good. I am not sure why it won an award. I felt like it was hard to follow and difficult to really visualize the characters. After reading the book, I am still left with questions about things that I just didn't understand. It kept talking about the masks and how putting on the mask changes you- as if something magical happens, but I didn't find that until at the end when the goblins are placing the masks on their spots on the walls and they come to life. They come to life because of a spell on them placed there by Graba and so I felt like the promise of how the masks changes things, didn't ever really come to reality in the book. The only thing that was hinted at was how the fox mask helped him become sure of himself. I also found it confusing to think that a heart could be removed from a boy and yet, they could still function- as a puppet? Why did he put the river mask on his brother and send him to the river? I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone- I finished reading it because I wanted to try to understand what was going on- but it was not a book I would say, Hey, you need to read this book."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1849094-amy", "userReview": "I tried to finish this for at least a year before I finally gave up and admitted that it wasn't my thing. I felt like I should read it since it won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature a couple years ago, but I guess the lesson here is that I shouldn't feel like I need to read ALL the award-winners (except for the Newbery - that's non-negotiable). It made me curious to learn more about the National Book Award and who decides which books win -- apparently, it's a panel of authors, with separate panels for fiction, non-fiction, young people's literature, and poetry. The fact that this book won reinforces my observation that award-winners aren't necessarily the ones that kids are clamoring to read, which isn't a bad thing. The award is given based on the quality of the book; it's not a popularity contest. And this is certainly a fine book -- I just typically don't go for fantasy, and I can't say I've had kids asking for it at the library. Still, every book has its reader, and I'm sure there are plenty of folks out there who liked this one.

Rownie is one of Graba's \"grandchildren,\" street children who run errands for Graba and whose minds she can control. But Rownie's goal is to find his months-missing older brother, who disappeared after a raid on a tavern in which he was performing.

Alexander\u2019s debut novel isn\u2019t by any stretch a bad book, but it is, in my mind, under-developed and unfocused and in the end, unsatisfying.Goblin Secrets is set in Zombey, a beguiling creation of a city split into two parts: upper class, clean Northside, with its straight streets laid out in a grid, and lower-class, cluttered and crowded Southside, full of winding, twisting lanes and alleys. ...

A fairy tale in the Neil Gaiman sense, but written with bit less polish overall, and definitely skewed younger. Dickensian-like ragamuffins roam clockwork cities, seeking an identity yet often hiding behind masks and mannerisms, trying to escape the all-knowing witch who'd enslave them.The witch and her house were very reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle, and the tale overall very Japanese in its approach to story telling.I'd rate this a 3 for adults, and a 4 for children of the appropriate age (7-11), which is younger than the ages listed by the publisher."}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13965364-bethany", "userReview": "Equal parts charming and dark this juvenile fiction novel entertainingly introduced me to a strange new world.

He fit very well the street urchin stereotype: clever, resourceful, scrappy, burying pain of lost family etc., but I always felt a little startled when he did something remarkable to move the plot along.
