Oh, my goodness, this book. Tugged at my heartstrings more than any other book has. I am in love with the Baxter family. In love with their stories, their heartaches. I feel like they are a part of me now.I knew beforehand that Karen Kingsbury does not write books that are full of fluffy Christianity, puppies, and rainbows. She writes about things that are tough and hard. Christians who are persecuted. Christians questioning their faith. Christians going through good times and bad times. I've been searching for an author who doesn't shy away from the hard facts about Christianity and Kingsbury is the best at giving the real picture."}, {"userName": "LadyCalico", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2288360-ladycalico", "userReview": "An OK fast light read for when you are in the mood for a soap opera. YA level of writing makes it a good choice on evenings when you are too tired to concentrate or engage your brain, but it would be a more enjoyable novel if any of the characters would grow a brain and engage it--but that would make it a shorter, leaner novella.

While still keeping the reader in touch with the entire Baxter family, this book centered more on Ashley \u2013 the self prescribed black sheep of the family, and Luke \u2013 the perfect son whose life isn\u2019t so perfect anymore. Ashley has never felt like she\u2019s fit in. Her close-knit Christian family is what others would consider ideal. But Ashley would call them \u201csafe\u201d. Ashley sought out to find more in life and traveled to Paris to make her mark in the art world and have some adventure. When she returns from Paris pregnant and tight-lipped, she drifts even farther from her family. She trusts no one, including God, and Landon Blake. Landon Blake has loved Ashley and tried to win her over since they were in their teens, but Ashley never returned that love because she felt Landon was just life her family \u2013 \u201csafe\u201d. Now, as Landon tries to woo her, she doesn\u2019t allow herself to give in. Not because she doesn\u2019t have feelings for Landon, but because he deserves so much more than she can offer. For his own benefit, Ashley keeps Landon at arm\u2019s length.Luke is riding high. Life is great, his steady girlfriend is great, and his future is looking bright. When his world comes crashing down around him\u2013just like the twin towers on 911\u2013 Luke begins to doubt the power of God. His humanistic leanings cause strain between him and his family so he moves out and seeks solace from a classmate that\u2019s more than willing to show him the errors of the Christian faith. Though he blames God for the turmoil in his life, he can\u2019t ignore the fact that it was his own mistake that started his life spiraling downward.REMEMBER was a quick read. Now, that could be because after reading REDEMPTION so much back story is already in your mind. Whatever the reason, upon finishing it, you can\u2019t wait to pick up the next in the series, RETURN. The more you read, the more you feel as if the Baxter\u2019s are your neighbors and you are genuinely concerned with their trials and circumstances."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55556656-danielle", "userReview": "Convinced she could make it on her own, Ashley Baxter has kept the most important people in her life at a distance\u2014her family, the man who loves her, and the God she is sure can never forgive her. Now, just as she begins to open her heart, the events of September 11 rip into Ashley\u2019s world and she is led to heartbreaking and hope-filled decisions that will forever change her life. This story vividly illustrates that we must value others more than ourselves, and it drives home one of Gary Smalley\u2019s key messages: Honor one another. Series: book 2 in the Redemption series; book 2 in the Baxter family series.Rating: 4 starsThis was a fascinating read. It isn't often that you read about either Alzheimer's or 9/11, but this book combined both subjects perfectly.I'm actually surprised at how much I enjoyed this. Christian contemporary fiction can be a hit or miss (usually miss because of the fluffiness), but this was a solid book. A+ to the authors. The main couple of the book is Ashley and Landon, but you get points of view from Kari and Ryan, tying up the loose ends from the previous book, and you also get points of view from Luke, setting up the next book in the series. You also get points of view from from John, their father, which was a cool way of seeing things, from the parental persepective of the outside looking in, kind of thing.Anyway, I enjoyed this book and cannot wait to continue the journey of the Baxter's, seeing how there is like 20 other books featuring them or something."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23130582-donna", "userReview": "What a good book, I liked it better than the first one in the series.

I was mostly expecting to make fun of this book and I certainly wasn't expecting to get pulled completely into the story. But of course I was! Yes, it was a little soap opera-ish and sometimes felt a little too much like a Victorian morality story from a pamphlet preaching the consequences of sin, and there were parts that grated just a little too much with my worldview, but overall I found it a pretty fun read. The book focuses on the Baxter family's five adult children and their relationships. This one was mostly about Ashley who went to Paris and came home pregnant (Gasp! And every time someone has sex, they get pregnant and of course no one has heard of a condom!). But I did enjoy the various love stories of the different siblings and watching the characters grow. There was a lot of growing in this book and I always like to see that. Some of the stereotypes were a little strong, but that didn't bother me too much either because all along it was pretty fun. I found it a very uplifting book, which I probably need in my life once in a while. It was full of good feelings and warm and fuzzies.Oh yeah, I should also mention that September 11 takes place during this book so a lot of the second half of the book is dealing with that. It got a little hard for me to read at some points. I know it has been ten years, but it's still painful. I thought it was interesting to see the different character's approaches to the situation and how they handled it. Though I do sound like I have a lot of negative things to say about it, I did really like this book, and I may even read the next one in the series."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1034783-elizabeth", "userReview": "This was an emotional book for me, I found myself in tears throughout. September 11 though many years ago still effects me greatly and when reading about those days events or seeing them on the screen it takes me back to the sadness of that day and the days that have followed. So between the fact that this book takes place during those events and then add in some adorable older people struggling with Alzheimer and it was a recipe for tears. This was another great read in the Baxter Family Series, it is the second in the series and only the second book by Karen Kingsbury that I have read and I hope I enjoy the next book as well. I will say this in hopes that things change a little bit. There is a series the \"Come Softly\" series by Janette Oke that I have never read. However, I have watched the movies and I enjoyed the first few movies greatly I even re-watched them which for me is pretty rare. I had to stop watching the movies and came to dislike all that I seen because there was one theme throughout each movie....death, the death of spouse to be exact as though that is the only trail one can face that would shake the very foundation of ones faith. It got old really fast. There is a theme in this series so far (I say this only being two books in) in which the main characters struggle with the same sin. That might get a little old if it keeps going. But I really enjoy the characters I feel invested in the family and I feel like I am ready to tackle, with great joy and anticipation, the next book in the series. I hope I don't get jaded because I really am enjoying the ride."}, {"userName": "Mayda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5054798-mayda", "userReview": "The overly dramatic rendition in this audio version does nothing but add to the melodrama of this tale. The sad saga of the Baxter family moves ever onward in this second installment. Perhaps I would find this series more credible if the characters didn\u2019t seem so stereotypical and plastic and didn\u2019t constantly tear up and cry so consistently. I found myself focusing in on the characters, just trying to find one that could make it through to the end of the book dry-eyed. (I didn\u2019t find one.) This story highlights Ashley and her problems. She is working in an Alzheimer\u2019s ward and in love with Landon, firefighter extraordinaire. The tragic demise of the Twin Towers figure prominently in this novel. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the story revolves around Ashley and her work in an Alzheimer\u2019s ward. In fact, the patients are far more interesting \u2013 and so are their back stories \u2013 than the main characters."}, {"userName": "Cydnie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742779-cydnie", "userReview": "The second in the Baxter Family / Redemption series. In the first novel we meet the Baxter family, but the novel is centered on the daughter Kari.  In Remember, the focus is on Ashley. Ashley went to Paris for a year just after high school and came home pregnant, no longer religious, and harboring a secret that shapes and affects all of her personal relationships. In this novel, we relive the events of September 11, 2001.

This is a more slower-paced book then the 1st book, (hence the 4 star rating) however it is just as great. Ashley is a very relatable character that has given into the worldly scene which has left her with a son without a father. She seems to pass her son off on her parents as they raise him the majority of the time while she discovers who she is in this life and tries to figure out her relationship with God. Throughout this book, Ashley reignites her relationship with God, allowing Him to show her the blessings in her life. She grows up very much and accepts responsibility for her son, and she learns to love (Landon) again.

Not for the faint of heart. If you just want a feel good romance type novel, go see Beverly Lewis. This is more modern day, and the characters are not perfect, nor does everything always have a happy ending. Parts of this book were difficult to read, because you weren't sure that Christian ideals and principles were really going to be upheld, or whether it would descend to the level of a soap opera - it didn't.

Since coming back from a trip to Paris to hopefully become a successful artist, she has been withdrawn from the family and doesn't seem to fit in. She's lucky to have to her parents to baby-sit her son, Cole. Landon Blake has wanted to be a part of her life since their school days, but Ashley doesn't think it would work since they're so different. They start spending more time together anyway. Landon loves Cole, and Ashley slowly realizes that she actually is in love with Landon. She even tells him all about what happened in Paris, from her disappointing comments about her paintings, to her affair with a famous artist, Jean-Claude Pierre. But telling Landon her deepest secrets cannot stop him from leaving to New York when 9/11 happens. Landon works tirelessly at Ground Zero, desperately searching for his friend, a firefighter who perished while trying to save people in the towers. Even when Landon returns home and he and Ashley both express how they feel, Landon goes back to New York to work at a fire house for at least a year. Ashley's job working at a home with Alzheimer's patients helps her tremendously with her feelings and also her love of God. John and Elizabeth Baxter continue with their faithfulness in God and trust Him to help with family struggles. Speaking of which, everything seems to be going so well with Luke Baxter and his girlfriend Reagan. They both have much in common including their love for God. They meet each other's parents. Luke is impressed with Reagan's dad and loves his office in the World Trade Center. He hopes to work there with him one day. But on September 10th, because Luke and Reagan get carried away on the couch, Reagan ignores a call from her dad and misses her chance to talk to him one last time. This throws Reagan over the edge. She goes to New York to be with her mother after the tragedy happens and the family knows her father won't be coming home. She doesn't take Luke's calls or talk to him for the rest of the book. In the meantime, Luke is a mess. Not only because of what happened on 9/11, but what Luke and Reagan did on 9/10, something they were trying so hard not to do until they were married. Luke moves out and in with a girl from his Communications class. Lori does not believe in God, and they both try to prove there is no God with a project they work on for their class. Kari is doing better from the tragedy of losing her husband. She even wants to mentor women who are having trouble in their marriages. Her first woman is actually her sister Erin who does not want to move due to her husband's job. Erin comes to accept the move. Kari still loves Ryan Taylor, and misses him since he is in New York for a job coaching the Giants. She visits with him once, and by the end of the book, we know Ryan will not be coaching for any pro teams anymore since he'll be moving back to Bloomington and marrying Kari. Brooke and Peter continue to become more involved in the church. Their daughter Maddie still is sick a lot."}, {"userName": "Molly Cafinated Reads Jaber", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48982273-molly-cafinated-reads-jaber", "userReview": "Another re-read review for me. I haven't read through the Baxters in some time, and lately I've been missing my momma, so I am glad to be back to the Baxters. They bring me closer to her since she hooked me on them. So, when I finished Redemption, I jumped into Remember and was not disappointed. Much like the first book, you feel like coming home with this one, too. Remember is a story that hits home with me. I was lost for a time, but with my mother's love and my father's love and the love of the good Lord above and lots of prayer, I found my sins were too much to bear alone, and I remember who I belonged to and who loved me. I just needed to honor them. Reading this book reminded me of that and made me so thankful for God in my life and remembering why I need Him in my life. Watching Ashley's story unfold, realizing the messages that God was leaving for her in those around her, really tugged at my heart. Ashley's character has always been a favorite of mine, and I felt like I was reunited with a long lost friend. This is definitely still a 5 star book in my opinion. This book will twist you up, make you smile, make you angry, and make you fall in love a fictional family all in the same setting. This family is no longer a fictional family for me, and I am happy to say that this book is still on my keeper shelf. The Lord truly knows how to work His grace and honor through the talented hands of Ms. Kingsbury and I love that. If you want a book that will be unforgettable and jump off the pages like a movie playing on the big screen, then look no further than that of this second book in the Redemption series.

I wish I had Johns faith, even when tested he trusts God. I find that I'm be a combination of all his and Elizabeths children. Aren't we all? So far, I've gone through all that the kids have been through one way or another. Reading these books I find myself pausing and comparing similarities in my life. All in all I have at least come to different conclusions: God has a plan for all of us. God answers our prayers. The answers may not be what we want. The prayer and the answer is not a direct journey from point A (prayer) to point B (Gods answer) but rather God takes the scenic route (life) for us to experience what is around us. During the journey we realize God has indeed answered our prayers and although it was not the answer we were expecting at the time, it is a wonderful answer just the same. God does have a plan for each of us. Be sure to read the authors notes at the end of the story. Read the discussion questions. Ponder the answers you have for them. It's a wonderful experience.I'm anticipating what Book three, Return. As I've noted vaguely above, life (faith) is a journey, and some of the trails we walk come back to where we began the walk.
