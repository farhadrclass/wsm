The writing style is brilliant: He tells the story of the Terri family, past and present, while at the same time telling the story of the Miramichi, both past and present. The writing jumps from past to present back to the far past and back again to the present, sometimes also changing viewpoints. So not easy to ready but it exemplifies how much the lives of his characters are entwined with each other, their past and the river. As for the characters, I hate to admit it but I will. If I were to met most of these characters in person, i would be afraid of them. However, I think Richards loves his characters and treats them with honesty and respect in such a way that I come to understand them to a certain extent."}, {"userName": "Paula Dembeck", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15166873-paula-dembeck", "userReview": "Sad tale of a family living on the Miramichi. In this small community it seems everyone is related. Old Simon Terri has two sons, Tully and George. George has three children \u2013 Packet, Lois and Little Simon. George is divorced from his first wife Elizabeth Ripley Terri who had an affair with Lester Murphy, a man who saved George\u2019s life during the war. Lester is also a stepbrother of Old Simon. Great descriptions of the Miramichi community in New Brunswick, besieged by financial woes, difficulties with the Indians and creeping economic and cultural Americanization. It seems that burdened by alcoholism, drugs and loveless sex nobody has a chance in life. Adams Richard's writing is depressing, but actually truly reflects aspects of life in some of these small rural towns."}, {"userName": "Michelle Hallett", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2276069-michelle-hallett", "userReview": "Underrated. One of my favourite of Richards' novels, this one works in currents and layers, very like a big river. He's not written in quite this manner since. It's a frightening and very intimate novel. I'll never be free of character Packet Terri."}, {"userName": "Dorothyanne Brown", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4429019-dorothyanne-brown", "userReview": "Lovely writing. Lovely.Grim reality, written so you feel the pores of your body absorbing it.I need a newer version, though - mine has tiny tine print and I can't read it!"}], "description": "The Terris are engaging people, but they are a family in collapse. Alcoholism, drugs, and loveless sex have reduced them to a petty and wasted bunch. Worse, they typify aspects of the larger community besieged by financial woes and by creeping economic and cultural Americanization.What David Adams Richards accomplishes is no mean feat: his characters are at times vicious, sleazy, and even outright dim, yet he manages to entitle them to the interest and sympathy of the reader.Even more now than at its first publication in 1981, Lives of Short Duration\u2019s sharp, essential insights have significance for readers seeking to understand the modern Canadian predicament.", "title": "Lives of Short Duration", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503642.Lives_of_Short_Duration", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320436663l/503642.jpg", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/87458.David_Adams_Richards", "name": "David Adams Richards"}], "type": ["Cultural", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503642.Lives_of_Short_Duration", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/151381.Mercy_Among_the_Children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110344.Nights_Below_Station_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110346.The_Friends_of_Meager_Fortune", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110347.River_of_the_Brokenhearted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425484.The_Bay_of_Love_and_Sorrows"]}
