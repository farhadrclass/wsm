I have seen them floating around for a while now, and when I saw Toni Aleo was writing one AND it was a hockey book, I decided to give it a go. Toni writes the best hockey stories! Gus \u2018the Bus\u2019 P is just got drafted to play for NHL team, The Tornadoes. Temporarily he\u2019s playing for the Suns, a lower level team and that\u2019s where he meets Bo, a PT student. There is a thin line between love and hate when it comes to Bo and Gus. Honestly, the first 25%+ is of them bickering and I ended up skimming a lot of that, but as the story went on, it did get better for me. I started to like Gus more, the more I got to know him and it\u2019s obvious that he and Bo have major chemistry! I love sports romance (hockey especially) and I love Toni Aleo\u2019s writing. Although this wasn\u2019t my favorite book of hers, it was still enjoyable for me overall and got better the more I read. I wish we would have had more of an epilogue, I think that would have made it all the better. Misadventures with a Rookie is a sexy and fun enemies to lovers story. Recommended to those who love sports romance and that trope!"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34530235-carol", "userReview": "3.5 stars.This book started off a little rough for me. Mainly because Gus Persson- the rookie hockey player and star of this book appeared to be way too much of a cocky, arrogant, insensitive manwhore for me to ever really like him. Boy was I glad that I just kept reading it anyway- as not only did Gus do a total 180 degrees in my eyes but I think I ended up liking him even more than the \"fiery\" Bo.This book was my first ever read by Toni Aleo and not only did it live up to my expectations for this Misadventures series (I have already read 5 of them) but I liked the way this story unfolded and I also liked the author's writing style.Ultimately, I found this to be a funny, entertaining, sweet and sexy read. My only regret for this book is I would have loved it, if the author had given me either an epilogue or a longer ending.ARC received in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mindy Lou's Book Review", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44132489-mindy-lou-s-book-review", "userReview": "4.5 Stars!This book really surprised me. In the beginning, I actually thought this was going to be my first book of Toni Aleo's that I wasn't going to like. I've loved everything I have read by her to date, but I learned real quick that the Hero in this book was the exact type that I do not enjoy in my books. He's arrogant. He's a player. He thinks he's God's gifts to women and hockey and I was just as disgusted by it as our heroine was. If you start out feeling the same way...keep reading. Man did I do a 180 about Gus. By the end, he became one of my favorite types of Hero's.The best thing about a womanizer is when they find the one woman to knock them off their feet. Gus became a new man the more time he spent with Bo. The more they were together, the more I fell in love with him right along with Bo. I am so glad I kept reading. What an amazing transformation he made as a man in love.Bo... while I sneered right along with her in the beginning, I still thought she was way too bitter. After learning more about her situation in the last half of the book. I got it. This poor girl. She got screwed 10 ways from Sunday and I get it why she was so bitter. Be patient. Gus is good for her.I don't always mention side characters but I got to mention Gus's parents. I loved them! I loved them almost as much as I loved our main characters. They were an awesome addition to this story. I really enjoyed this book.ARC provided by NetGalley."}, {"userName": "DJ Sakata", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18344018-dj-sakata", "userReview": "Favorite Quotes:The way she looked at me, like I stole her doll and drew dicks on its mouth, revved my engines.It had been a long time since I yearned for a woman, probably because they usually threw themselves at me.

Maybe I should indulge in them more often, or maybe I should just read more of the comically talented Ms. Aleo\u2019s work as I was engaged throughout and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I was highly entertained by the premise as well as the expletive-spewing and quirky accident-prone characters with their salacious sensual scenes and inner musings, which morphed into a sweet/sizzling romance. Ms. Aleo has a wicked sense of humor and excellent pacing. I adored the character\u2019s clever exchanges, witty quips, and saucy banter - especially those flowing from the elder Perssons who were obviously the fun parentals. More, please, Ms. Aleo. I greedily want all your naughty tales."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Jensen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57738424-elizabeth-jensen", "userReview": "This Book is amazing! As an avid Toni reader I appreciate all of her work but this book made me go through a variety of emotions and I found myself smiling and laughing out loud at most of the story. Let me start by saying, the hero in this book is fantastic! It appears as though he gets everything handed to him on a silver platter but his work ethic and drive showcase the kind of man he is. This is a story about the thin line between love and hate and how easy it is to assume you think you know someone based on guilt and past experiences. Bo can't help but let her previous encounters control her opinions of Hockey players, but Gus comes in and takes on the task of proving her misconceptions wrong, and a few right. He is caring a willing to stand by Bo's side in all sorts of crazy circumstances. I found myself laughing along with the characters as the scenes were highly entertaining.I was drawn into this story right away and when I read about Gus' family I was sucked in even more. It is a good example of how to love and support your children with friendship but still push them to work as hard as possible for the things they want and need. The same supportive relationship is built between Bo and Gus. They were able to laugh together, even in intimate moments and that is priceless in a relationship. This book was better than I anticipated and Toni has already set the bar incredibly high. I loved this book and I will likely be finding myself rereading this book many times over.I received an advanced copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4718511-heather", "userReview": "*I voluntarily read an early copy of this title in exchange for an honest review**The Misadventures Series has been a lot of fun with so many different and engaging books and Toni Aleo has added a clear winner to the stable!Gus Persson has always dreamed of playing in the NHL. He was drafted by the Twin Cities Tornadoes, but the brass determined he wasn't quite ready, so he's out in California with their AHL affiliate. While he's known for bedding a different woman every night and only spending one night with them, one of the Sun's Ice Girls has caught his attention and he would like nothing more than to get to know her better.For Bo St. James hockey has always been part of her life, but she has sworn off having any kind of relationship with a hockey player. She's totally focused on completing school and working. She's all about reaching her goals and not about letting a man influence any of her decisions.As Bo and Gus get to know one another, Bo wants to hate him, but the chemistry they share is difficult to deny. As they spend more time together, it becomes clear that they may actually be exactly what the other needs in their life. Can they overcome things that have happened in the past and figure out how to move forward together?I adored both of these characters. Gus was swoonworthy and he was a man that was brought up right and knew how to treat a woman even if it didn't necessarily appear that way on the surface. Bo was a strong female character and even though she was fighting many demons from her past, it was fantastic to see her grow as the book progressed. Together these two were magical and this story illustrated that when you find your person, everything you thought you knew can be turned on it's head in an instant.I'd highly recommend this latest Misadventures tale!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Clinton", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24373930-elizabeth-clinton", "userReview": "Hockey & Toni Aleo go hand in hand. Misadventures with a Rookie is an absolutely fantastic Read right from the very first page. We meet Gus \u201cthe bus\u201d Persson a cocky as all hell up and coming Hockey player just waiting for his chance to play in the NHL. While he waits he plays hard not only on the ice but also off the ice. That is until he meets Bo St. James. Bo St. James is a hard working student trying to get her degree, working and moving on with her life but when she catches the eye of Gus her life does a complete turn and she can\u2019t help bring out all her Sass towards him. The banter between the two of them will have you laughing out loud, maybe shed a few tears and even let out a sigh or two but the chemistry you feel coming off the pages will be amazing. Sometimes you can\u2019t help fall for secondary characters but when you meet Gus\u2019s Mom Lauren you will understand why.

Toni's ability to combine comedy and reality is rather impressive from a reader standpoint because you get so engrossed in the story-line and feel like you are part of these characters. You simply cannot assume about the characters, like they did to one another in the book, because reality does not like assumptions. So don't be like me and assume the title will be an oddly weird story (Because honestly that is exactly my thought when i was told I would be reading this ARC of this story) It turned out to be a GREAT love story that starts off in the hate-love kind of way and the comedic relief were placed just right throughout the story that it came together so smoothly. but seriously, please enjoy the unicorn spit because I need to find this stuff right NOW! thank you Toni Aleo, for giving your readers yet another story to latch onto and lose themselves in the well developed characters and plot line!"}, {"userName": "Katie Clark", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17559433-katie-clark", "userReview": "**I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review. **Toni Aleo\u2019s books never cease to amaze me!

Wow, to say I\u2019m loving the name Bocephus for the heroine was too funny. Bo, for short, was one of the Ice Girls for the AHL Malibu Suns in California. She was working part-time and interning for the team to become a physical therapist. Bo could not stand Gus \u201cthe Bus\u201d Persson because she thought he was a cocky rookie hockey player that chased any girl available and then dumped her after he got what he wanted . I was surprised they connected right away, but I think Bo thought this would be a \u201cone and done\u201d....not. They were hot for each other once Bo got tired of missing sex and figured after they hit the sheets, she would never see him again. This was a really great read to me. I laughed just about all the way through the book. There was a lot of twists and turns but in the end I think they make a great couple.

This does nothing to tame his out of control ego. As much as she wants to continue to hate him Bo can\u2019t lie to her-self that she is majorly attracted to this arrogant jerk. You ever read a book and when you are done absolutely hate that you read it? Well this is one of those books for me. I hate that I gave this book a chance because I will never get to experience the initial feelings had reading this book. I could read it over a dozen times and never feel what I felt the first time I actually disliked these two, never experience how initially felt laughing at these two, or never experience the first time I realized how much I loved these two again. For lack of a better description, I guess it\u2019s like that first high an addict experiences. No matter how many more time they get high they will never achieve that initial feeling. I\u2019m a Toni Aleo fan and this book was a new experience for me. Usually I\u2019m reading her series and with each new book you kind of already know the characters because they appeared in one or more of the previous books. Not this time. I had no idea who these people where and didn\u2019t know anything about them I was kind of going in blind. When I first started I didn\u2019t think I was going to like it simply because I didn\u2019t like either of the characters. Bo was just a straight up bitch. I mean this chick went in hard with her dislike for Gus and considering she didn\u2019t even know it, I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it and Bo\u2026.I mean Jesus, what a freaking jerk! This dude slept with pretty much any chick and let it be known\u2026he also let it be known that it was his thing to hit and run. Somewhere along the way there was a shift and these two became very likeable. Aside from his man-whoring, Gus was actually a really sweet guy and for a guy who didn\u2019t do relationships, he slid into the boyfriend roll pretty easily and Bo, for as rude as she was to him, her heart softened pretty easily. I think of all of books, these two are my favorite couple.There are some secrets discovered and some self-discovery that help make this one damned good read."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4657556-ashley", "userReview": "Addicted and I need more!! *spoilers*I\u2019ve read almost every book from Toni Aleo and I have to say that this one is up there with the best. Bo and Gus are two of the best made characters that she has brought to us. They were easy to relate to and very human. That\u2019s a big reason I love reading her books so much. It\u2019s not about having all the money in the world and living big. They all have these beautiful, sometimes heart-wrenching, backstories that continue to pull and suck you into this world she has created. I love that she gives you two sides of a very complicated topic that is still argued on today. Teen pregnancy. The fact that Gus\u2019s Mom was able to conquer single motherhood and come out on top was amazing. However, when she showed another side to it, where the teen mom doesn\u2019t feel in control of her choices and it\u2019s thrown in her face for a long time, is so deep and well written. Things in life are never black and white, and Toni has an amazing way of bringing that out into the light. Then on the other hand, is the child being raised by a single mother. Most believe that there are only a few choice ways for a kid in that situation to turn out, but she is able to make her own path. Which is true for most kids that are raised in such ways. I love how close Gus is to his mother, and his father. Even after everything they went through. Family is family and I love that dynamic of the story."}, {"userName": "Sissy's Romance Book Review ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1831318-sissy-s-romance-book-review", "userReview": "Misadventures with a Rookie by Toni Aleo is book 11 in the Misadventures series.

Women flock to Gus to take a ride on the bus constantly, no women has ever said no. Bo St. James is an ice girl who just wants to be left alone by everyone to focus on school. Gus sees Bo has a challenge and will not stop until she is his. As Gus and Bo get closer, they start to see the real person behind the facade, will they be willing to let their guard down completely.Written in Aleo's laugh out loud sense of humor with life situations that can only be described as yep that can happen. Great depth in the character development that makes you have emotional connection to the characters. I hope to see more of the Hockey Suns and Minnesota Tornadoes in the future."}], "description": "***MISADVENTURES ARE STANDALONE ROMANCES THAT CAN BE READ IN ANY ORDER***Winning has always come naturally for stud ice hockey defenseman Gus \u201cthe Bus\u201d Persson.

As the best player in his rookie class and the number-one draft pick of the Malibu Suns, he\u2019s taking his game to the next level and is justifiably full of swagger.  So why does one of the Suns\u2019 ice girls treat him like he\u2019s invisible? Bo St. James doesn\u2019t have time for rookie hotshots who think their gloves don\u2019t stink. She knows them, she works with them, she trains them. It doesn\u2019t matter that Gus Persson is the hottest newbie she\u2019s ever seen. She knows his type. She\u2019s got big plans of her own, and she\u2019s not going to let some cocky rich kid athlete keep her from her goals. But there\u2019s a chemistry between them they cannot deny.
