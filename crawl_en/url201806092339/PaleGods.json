While reading the last 10%, I effectively put the world on ignore and bit into the ending like a walker onto Darryl Dixon. Yes, I know, this would turn the world on its end, but that's what this book does to our understanding of Zombies.Pale Gods was written by a religious scholar and theologian, and it shows. The novel takes the reader on a wonderful adventure on the high seas, but the adventurous nature of the story is just the setting for a deeper discussion. The story begins long after the Zombies have overtaken and dominate the mainlands. The islands have become the safe havens for society, but supplies are needed, and sailors visit the coasts of America to bring back goods. The characters Ridley and King attend a church sermon, and a rousing explanation of the tale of Lazarus is the final catalyst for both character and reader to go see what the real world has to offer. It also is the start of some incredible dialogue and discourse on the nature of God, consciousness, and good and evil.The characters on the ship and how they interact is what makes this story work so well. The contrast between the captain and his mates was wonderful, and the dialogue spoke so true. I suspect a thesis could be written comparing and contrasting their worldviews on God, the universe, the nature of Zombie happiness. (damn it, they seem so content, or at least non-miserable I can't take it) (My words, not the authors)Sailing with the group felt a bit like being aboard the Orca, listening to Quint, Hooper, and the Chief share battle wounds and process the nature of the universe, or perhaps a ride on The Nellie, riding to the Heart of Darkness with Marlowe, or hunting Moby-Dick on the Pequod. Of course, in Pale Gods, George Romero is co-captain of the ship.Dancing around spoilers here, but the crew hear rumors that the zombies are acting different by grouping in families and protecting their young. One adventurer has gone a bit insane claiming he saw some form of Zombie deity among the undead. For a captain who rages against the idea of God, this doesn't bode well, so he needs to decide if he should put them down or allow them to evolve. In some ways, the story shows humans as devolving into savages and the zombies becoming more human. Damn does the author do a good job of making the Zombie genre his own with this. There were a few paragraphs I had to endure, but oddly enough it was during some of the action scenes that zombie lovers will probably cherish, where I was just as curious to hear how the mix of characters would process the incident. I could listen to this group discuss the meaning of life, God, the universe, and the nature of scavenging all day.Zombie Fiction is such a huge mix, and we all like ours cooked different, so some won't love this book the way I did, but for me it was cooked just right."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21684662-kevin", "userReview": "I thought it was well written and a clear shot away from the standard zombie novel that too many people are writing these days."}, {"userName": "Franco Boggle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18900184-franco-boggle", "userReview": "i review this book as the kind of zombie fan that follows the Romero Gospel. By saying that i point that im biased and therefore dont like when people try to make zombies think, feel or try to communicate. i do admire people that try to bring something new to the genre but most of the times i do not find it to my liking.aside from that i found appealing the idea of groups of people on islands that had an extensive trade system which used all kinds of money. but i do think its useless to think in a zombie world that island would be safe. Corpses float and therefore would be washed to the islands anyway.The characters are extremely weak to my taste. they have strong opinions but not interesting backgrounds that give them any uniqueness. the only one that came close to an interesting past was the captian. Now, this character annoyed me more than the King. as an atheist i found the captian as a bipolar, hateful individual that would go on bashing and long monologs against christianity with no justifiable reason... and im an atheist, theres plenty of reasons to bash christianity but this character just random and annoying.other than that, im glad it was a short book. i did listen to it at work which took me like 8 hours and that is just weak, even more when the zombie killing was minimal and most of the book is about random theological discussions that bored me more than made me think... and although i just have a minor in religious studies this book didnt inspire me with any new thoughts on religion or the lack of it"}, {"userName": "Mikehendo", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/255070-mikehendo", "userReview": "Pale gods just keeps building and building only to be wrapped up in a couple pages with an anti-climactic ending. Much in the vein of The Road or California, little happens and the conclusion is lackluster."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3601215-mary", "userReview": "Great concept, I just couldn't get into it. :("}], "description": "With all the continents overrun by the living dead, the hubs of commerce and civilization are no longer New York or London or Beijing: they\u2019re Nantucket, Havana, and Reykjavik. The sea is not the deadly, foreboding barrier it once was to human life: now it\u2019s their source of safety, transportation, and sustenance. But the mainland beckons reckless, restless men, just as the sea did hundreds of years before, luring them with the promise of riches and danger. Sailing from Nantucket, the Hyperion takes six foragers on such a quest: Jacob, the scarred captain who lost half his right hand to the dead; Ridley, a young man full of curiosity and naivet\u00e9; King, a devout Christian who tries to keep the captain\u2019s madness in check; Sink, who seems to thrive on the casual brutality of their trade; Phil, for whom this is just the best job to support his family in this strange, violent world; and Spider, a boy raised in the post-apocalyptic world, barely aware any other kind of life ever existed. Their journey takes them back to the land from which they\u2019ve been banished, to steal back from the hungry dead all the things people once took for granted, the remnants of human art and ingenuity, before these are completely lost in the decaying ruins. But this time, they will find not just fuel and tools and weapons, but cities full of dead who are smarter, better prepared, and with their own mysterious agenda.", "title": "Pale Gods", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19296326-pale-gods", "average": 2.89, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386535684l/19296326.jpg", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/63950.Kim_Paffenroth", "name": "Kim Paffenroth"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19296326-pale-gods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/407281.Dying_to_Live", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4772386-life-sentence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2261456.History_is_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6856865-the-world-is-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969055-last-rites"]}
