It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. The writing was mediocre and I couldn't bring myself to like any of the characters. I literally figured out the plot line in the beginning and the view point changes were annoying and unnecessary. I know it's a genre books but it was just so derivative of every other mystery book I've read, there was nothing original or good about it. You can't be a mediocre writer with boring cliched characters and a predictable plot line like come on man give me something."}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-eve", "userReview": "\u201cI think most sociopaths are born, not made. Very few are created by life events.\u201d \u2013 Kate Burkholder, Chief of PoliceIt\u2019s a dark, quiet morning, the kind I usually relish while drinking a hot cup of coffee at my kitchen table with warm puppies at my feet. Today, I shiver in my onesie while I wait for my pot of coffee to brew. I\u2019m facing the kitchen window that looks onto the otherwise idyllic, peaceful neighborhood, and thinking about the book I finished reading the day before. I wonder if someone\u2019s secretly peeking back at me, possibly planning to ambush me later in the shower and murder me. Brrrrrr. If you\u2019re planning on reading this, I believe Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s Jurassic Park warning should be heeded: \u201cHold on to your butts.\u201dPainters Mill, Ohio\u2013sleepy farming community where a third of the population are Amish. Kate Burkholder, Chief of Police has childhood ties to the community, which come back to haunt her when a string of serial murders resurface after sixteen years. Who is the killer? Why the hiatus? Why the escalation in murders and change in MO? Burkholder and her patchwork team of sidekicks are on the trail, but everyone\u2019s got secrets.I will be honest. There is something about cozy settings and brutality that fascinates me. Not that anything really shocks us anymore, right? One never really knows who one\u2019s neighbors are. But the idea that something can happen in a quiet, peaceful community is always attention grabbing, and Castillo does an excellent job of really drawing in the reader. She shocks you! Lures you into pacivity, and then assaults you again. You\u2019re never really comfortable reading through this. I may just do something I never do, and jump into the next book in the series.

Lately I have been struggling to find a good crime thriller book that keeps me guessing and really in suspense. I'm really glad I stumbled across this one. The pace is fast and there is a lot of suspense. I found the book very difficult to put down. I really liked the main character, Chief Kate Burkholder. She is a strong, independent woman with an Amish background. I enjoyed learning a little bit about the Amish way of life and thought it clever how the author worked this into the storyline. I was never bored at all through the story and I even didn't mind the small bit of romance thrown in towards the end (I normally don't care for it). The crime scenes were described in quite graphic detail, so I probably wouldn't recommend this if you don't like reading that sort of thing. However, I enjoyed the story and look forward to reading the rest in the series."}, {"userName": "Mary Beth *Traveling Sister*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14233569-mary-beth-traveling-sister", "userReview": "This is the first book in the Kate Burkholder Series and Ijust loved it. One of the many reasons that I loved it so much is that I live in the Columbus, Ohio area where some of the setting is taken place. Kate is an eight year veteran for the Columbus, Ohio Police Force, who returns to her home where she grew up in Painters Mill,Ohio, where I have visited several times. She becomes Police Chiefthere. She knows the Amish town and residents very well. Since she left the Amish way of life, she is not very well liked there in thecommunity. A horrible mutilated body is found of a young woman in in a field. A similar series of crimes had occurred in the community16 years ago, where four young ladies were murdered. Thekillings had stopped, and now it appears that the killer has come back. Kate doesn't believe though that the killer has comeback, due to a secret that she and two others had kept since shewas 14 years old. If the same person has returned then everything she knows is wrong. Also if the murder case is reopened, she risksnot only losing her career but also the lives of those that had kepther secret. Two other victims are discovered and Kate becomes firedfrom her job, but she stays on the case on her own time while seeking the identity of the killer and putting her own self up asthe victim.What makes Sworn to Silence such an awesome read is that Castillo's descriptions of the quiet and tranquil surface of life in the rural County with the undercurrent of the violence that dramaticallyreveals itself without warning. I recommend this book to all thatlove a great and fantastic thriller. I cannot wait to read the rest ofthe series."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "New author to me and I enjoyed it very much! The main character, Kate Burkholder, was interesting and likeable. She made mistakes but persevered and eventually got her man. The story was excellent, lots of really gross murders, lots of police work and then a great twist at the end. I was just beginning to wonder if it could be a certain person when it turned out to be so. I also very much enjoyed the Amish angle to the plot. It added an extra something to the whole and I learned a little about their way of life.Altogether a really good book and an excellent start to another series:)"}, {"userName": "Tim The Enchanter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5654692-tim-the-enchanter", "userReview": "Posted to  The Literary Lawyer.ca   A Chilling Tale in a Beautiful Place - 4.5 Stars  I am going to start this review with a confession. For reasons now lost to the ravages of time, I long had a prejudice against female authors. My impression was that books by female authors would be sappy, romantic, emotional or uninteresting. I went to university, got married and had two girls. Once the I got the aforementioned out of the way, I got back into reading and asked myself why it was I didn't read books by female authors. I have to say I was a stupid man for holding a stupid prejudice. The majority of the best crime/mystery fiction I have read in the past several year have been written by women. I have discovered Tana French, Sharon Bolton, Chelsea Cain, Belinda Bauer, Denise Mina to name a few. These women have written intricate tales with deep and nuanced characters. They have avoided many stereotypes and have skillfully written male and female characters. Their female characters are at times tragic and broken while encapsulating strength and determination. To the other female authors whose wonderful books I will soon discover, please accept this as my sincere apology.Now that my soul has been laid bare, on to this book.Should you ever want to vacation in a peaceful and idyllic place, let me suggest Holmes County Ohio and the surrounding towns and cities. There you will find small towns with wholesome names such as Sugarcreek and Walnut Creek. The towns are a mix of modern and traditional with dollars stores and clothing shops run by \"English\" residents and quilt shops, bake shops and furniture stores run by local Amish residents. My wife and I have vacationed here several times and we look forward to returning again. Now imagine that a brutal killer is terrorizing this beautiful and peaceful place, abducting and killing young women, English and Amish alike. To me, this type of terror in this setting is far more horrific. Plot summary Kate Burkholder is the main character and police chief of the small town, Painter's Mill. The town, like much of the surrounding area, is made up of two distinct cultures, the English and the Amish. Kate is a product of both cultures. Until her teens, she grew up and was raised Amish. After living through some horrific events in her teens, she left the Amish way of life and live the \"English\" life. Although a part of both worlds, she doesn't belong to either but is tasked with keeping law and order in both. A woman is found dead with roman numerals carved into her stomach. This shocks the town and spreads panic as this appears to replicate a series of murders 16 years earlier. The old murders, dubbed \"The Slautherhouse Killings\" are personal to Kate and despite the fact everyone believes the old killer has returned, she believes someone else is at work. As a result, her judgment is impaired and she make a series of poor decisions. Murders continue to pile up until the chilling and gripping final confrontation. The Good  Best of Both Worlds I thought the setting and setup of the novel was fascinating. The novel was series of contrasts that flowed from beginning to end. Kate was a product of two cultures, neither of which truly accepted her. This made her both compelling and relatable. Who hasn't felt as if they didn't fit in at some point in their life. The author expertly weaves this theme throughout the story while providing interesting and telling insights into both cultures.In my opinion, the most interesting characters are those that have elements of strength and fragility. While Kate is a strong character, she is haunted by the events in her past. These events lead her to make decisions that the reader knows are wrong, misguided or selfish. While she retains a strong sense of morality from her Amish upbringing, he past has allowed her to justify bad behavior. Without a doubt, Kate Burkholder is one of the most interesting main characters I have read in a very long time. The Bad  &%!# It Kate is not the only broken characters. Early in the novel we are introduced to John Tomasetti another officer of the law with a recent past as an avenging angel. There are many ways to make your character seem rough around the edges, troubled, tortured or broken. The author chose to use adult language to punctuate his lack of care for the world. It got to the point that I was simply annoyed and put off with the language. If he shows up in future novels, I hope he is forced to spend a few months with an Amish family and he is shamed into cleaning up his mouth. Overall, the adult language was excessive and detracted from the rating. Audiobook Notes I listened to the audiobook version of this novel. In this case, the narrator impacted on the overall rating. For the first quarter of the book I found her narration to be unappealing and lacking in emotion. The voice she used for John Tomasetti was a bit painful. She attempted a deep gruff voice that came off as more grating. Fortunately, she came into her own as the story progressed and her narration in the final confrontation was stunning and was dripping with emotion. It made for a powerful scene. Despite a rough start and a bad voice for one character, her narration was a 4 of 5. Final Thoughts I should note that the subject matter is dark. If you see that this is set amongst the Amish and are expecting a \"cozy mystery\" in the like of some book like \"A quilting circle murder\", you will be very disappointed. There is a dark edge to our killer that would fit right into an S.J. Bolton novel. This is an excellent book and about as close to five stars as I can get without going the whole way. If you like tense thrillers with a dark antagonist, this book is for you.  Content Advisories  It is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. *Disclaimer* I do not take note or count the occurrences of adult language as I read. I am simply giving approximations.Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex  -  3.5 While there is no graphic sex, there is significant discussion of sex as related to assaults. Victims are sexually assaulted and there is some discussion on how sexual assault and torture were related. There is a scene where there is an attempted sexual assault that is moderately graphic. There is sexual tension between some characters and there is some \"lead up\" to sex and sex is ultimately implied. Language  -  4.5 As stated above, I took some issue with the language in the book. There was the entire gambit of language moderate to high use of mild obscenities, scatological terms and religious exclamations. There was also moderately high use of the f-word. This book is not suitable for younger readers. Violence  -  4 As with most crime thrillers, violence is an integral part of the story. I gave this a 4 as most of the violence inferred through the examination of the victims bodies and was, for the most part, moderately graphic. The final confrontation is quite graphic and will be disturbing for some readers. Readers who are not comfortable with sex crimes should avoid this novel."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24360539-thomas", "userReview": "A solid 4 starsThis is book 1 in the series about a small town Ohio police chief in Amish country. Kate Burkholder was raised Amish, but left the community and became a police officer in Columbus, Ohio. She has returned as chief, hired because of her Amish background. The book opens with a gruesome torture/murder scene. It reminded me of the opening scene in the tv show Criminal Minds. When the body is discovered, there is a Roman numeral carved on the body, the same as a series of serial murders that stopped 16 years ago. Kate has a secret. She believes that she killed that murderer 16 years ago. The mystery mounts as more bodies are found with the same signature, and I could not put this book down. I did not suspect who the killer was was until near the end.I discovered this series when I won book 8 in a GR giveaway last year and resolved to read more. Both my wife and I enjoy this series.There is some graphic violence. This is not a cozy mystery.Some quotes:Kate--\"I groan inwardly at the power and speed of the Painters Mill rumor mill. If it could be harnessed to generate electricity, no one would ever have to pay another utility bill again.\"Ohio BCI(Bureau of Criminal Investigation) agent Tomasetti describing Kate -\"A gun toting, cursing, former Amish female chief of police.

Rrrrrrrippppp!That's the sound of me ripping this book. If you loved this and have troll instincts, stop reading now because I will not be kind.I really have to stop reading mysteries. I keep hoping this one will be the next P.D. James or Elizabeth George (in her good days); multidimensional interesting characters circulating in a truly gripping and suspenseful plot. Well, wrong again. \"Sworn to Silence\" was incredibly predictable and cliched, with stock, one-dimensional characters. Not to mention annoying and unnecessary viewpoint switching, excessive and repetitive hyping of events' drama (how many times can this be the first time in someone's long career that they were so deeply affected by whatever?), repeated gratuitous detailed scenes (how many times do we have to read yet another scene where some unsuspecting citizen finds the body, witness the victim's devastated parents learning the news of their daughter's death in an excruciating play by play, or hear all about the latest victim's evisceration?). Even the Amish angle failed to redeem the book's pedestrian qualities, especially since it felt stereotyped. What's more, reading this book felt at times like reading a sequel to a possibly more interesting but unfortunately unread book as some of the action and intrigue surrounded events that took place before the present story.Kate, the central character, is chief of police in a small town with a large Amish population. Kate herself was raised Amish and left the fold at eighteen; yet she works in the community in which she grew up. This might have given rise to some interesting complications; sadly, the author did not develop this aspect of the story sufficiently and relevant encounters between Kate and her former compatriots were handled superficially. Kate is Kinsey Milhoune to the tenth power; a tough-as-nails female cop who both intimidates and inspires passionate loyalty in just about everyone who meets her (unless they're bad guys). I've met tough people in real life and admired their competence but not necessarily liked them personally, and also noticed that they were capable of irritating the people working under them. Not a problem for Kate, clearly, who is dearly loved by her subordinates and colleagues. Of course, her tough exterior masks a secret blah blah blah and the right guy (you'll never guess who!) will finally break down her defenses. Mr. Macho Hero is also a tough-yet-wounded figure -- no, really -- and love magically overcomes a lot of his issues which should really be a bit harder to fix.So much for characterization. As far as the plot goes, it plods over well-worn Nancy Drew lines of red herring (which went on forever and wasn't all that interesting) followed by getting closer to the killer, followed by a dangerous confrontation with the killer (will Kate be rescued?), whatever whatever.Once again, the high goodreads rating suggests that I'm in the minority but if you're a curmudgeon like me, you might want to look for something else."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine", "userReview": "This book hooked me in the prologue and did not let go until the very last page. Whew!!!!! Easily a 5 star rating from me and tied for first place (with S.J. Bolton's Now You See Me) as my favorite read (of 45 books) in the last 12 months. Honestly, I cannot recall the last time a book pulled me in so deep that there was not a single break in my attention. Cover to cover immersion. Ms. Castillo has a number of romances/romantic suspense novels under her belt. Sworn to Silence, I believe, is her first attempt at a mystery thriller, which makes the wonderfulness of this book all the more remarkable. Furthermore, I have heard from others that some of the subsequent books in this 6 book (so far) series are even better; I can't imagine!Why did I like this book so much? As noted above, my attention was unwavering. In addition, the setting was different with the action set in Amish country. The mystery was very well plotted out with the revelation of the bad guy a big surprise to me. I especially loved Ms. Castillo's character development. The protagonist, Kate Burkholder, is an extremely complex being. The author is slowly peeling away the layers of her personality, something that I suspect will continue as the series progresses. I love Kate Burkholder, flaws and all. There was good initial character development of other supporting players who I also suspect we will learn even more about in subsequent books. The pace of the book was perfect, always a big plus. There was no agonizing set up taking the first 15-33% of the pages, yet I did not feel any necessary background was missing. This is a rare find these days, in my experience. There was a small sidelight of romance (couldn't help yourself, could you, Ms Castillo?) which was totally nongraphic and nonintrusive to the story. I personally thought it was done perfectly. One warning, the crime scenes ARE graphic and very dark. To say the villain was deranged is an understatement. I cannot think of anything I did not like about this book.I strongly recommend this to all mystery/thriller fans except those who like cozy mysteries only. This is a \"can't miss\" novel in the genre. I repeat, DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK.

After reading two recent novels in the series that I won through Goodreads Giveaway, I was so impressed with the writing , I went and ordered all her other books in the series. This is the review of her first novel, a gripping,tense story of a sexual serial killer in Painters Mill in Ohio, home of the Amish community. I am now hooked on the series.After sixteen years, it appears that a serial murderer is back, torturing and killing young women in the area of Painters Mill, Ohio, a community where Amish and English people have live side by side. Kate Burkholder, the Chief of police, grew up in an Amish household in the area but, after a traumatic experience as a teenager, she left the faith and moved to Columbus to become a policewoman and, later, a homicide detective. Now, back in the community, she must live in both worlds. Kate with her background understands the pacifistic culture of her jurisdiction, and the Pennsylvania Dutch language...but she doesn't belong in either world.Assisting Kate in tracking down the murderer is John Tomasetti, agent for the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation. John also has a traumatic past and is as lost as Kate is. The two are drawn together professionally and personally as they work to identify the murderer.This is an intriguing story and very well-written. Sworn to Silence is written in two \u201cvoices\u201d - the traditional third-party past tense and Kate\u2019s first-person present tense. These two viewpoints, add strength to the plot and allow the two voices to blend together.I highly recommend this fast-paced quality novel.

The killer's signature is to leave Roman numerals carved on the murdered victim. Kate's conflicted as she's harboring a secret that relates directly to the case. Painters Mill is a town where the Amish and \"English\" have coexisted for years. Kate straddles both cultures as she was raised Amish but left when she was a teenager. I've had this book on my shelf for a long time even though it was strongly recommended by friends. Thinking it was on the cozy side of the mystery genre (not my favorite side), I backburnered it until now. Let me make this clear...this story is polar opposite of a cozy; gritty, gruesome and gnarly. I really liked this story with its flawed characters and unusual setting. Kate's still trying to come to terms with her past, which shapes her perspective in the present. John Tomasetti, the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations (BCI) agent sent to help Kate, has his own demons and forges an uneasy alliance with her. The cultural aspects of the Amish community are interesting, especially when contrasted with the realities of the coexistence with those outside of their world. While Kate makes many errors of judgment driven by her personal involvement in the case, she's still an admirable character. The case wasn't easy to resolve and kept my interest through the end.

So, all and all it was probably for the best since I did enjoy starting this series from the beginning instead of the latest book. Police chief Kate Burkholder, ex-Amish, has to stop a vicious killer in this book that may be a copycat or a killer that murdered several women 16 years ago. However, she has personal reasons for believing that it has to be another killer. It doesn't get easier for her when her role as police chief is getting questioned as more people are killed while she is trying to figure out who the killer is. Some local people just don't think she is trying hard enough... I found the book to be very good, and very different from other crime novels. I like that Kate Burkholder has a history with the Amish community and I liked that she is a complex character with a dark past. Also, this case really brought back bad memories for her. The case also brought agent John Tomasetti into her life as he who was hellbent on wrecking his life and career seems to have finally found someone that can get his life back on track. I quite like the chemistry between them. The case was interesting, is it the same killer or a copycat? What is really going one and what happened to Kate all those years ago? I did, however, figure out the killer when Tomasetti listed the killer profile, it was actually quite easy to do so I thought and then I just kept on reading to see if I was right, and I was. But, it did not take away the enjoyment of reading the book.

There's a fine line for me in what moves the plot forward and what is over the top and just plain too much. I got turned off on James Patterson for just this reason. Right or wrong this bothers me even more when women write violent scenes, as is the case in Linda Castillo's Sworn to Silence. I have to weigh the merits of the violence to the overall story. Would the story have had the same impact with less descriptive murders. In this case, I'd have to say yes. I was immediately hooked on the broken characters of Kate Burkholder, Chief of Police of Painters Mill, and John Tomasetti, Special Agent who together try to solve a series of horrific serial murders similar to those committed years ago by a fiend dubbed The Slaughterhouse Killer. Kate's character sings true. She harbors haunting secrets from when she was a teen living the plain life of the Amish and as an adult is now under a bann, having left the Amish life behind. Tomasetti, is dealing with his own nightmares after the murder of both wife and daughters to someone trying to get back at him in the most awful way. Burkholder and Tomasetti make a great team and I'm rooting for them both from the get-go. But the violence of the crimes in the end turns me off. Ok, the prologue hooked me. I see the monster, I feel the terror and I am hooked. I get it; I did not need to be graphically reminded throughout of the killer's depravity.

Fourteen year old Kate Burkholder thought she survived the terror of the Slaughterhouse Killer but left Painters Mill and her Amish faith behind when she was eighteen. She also carried a secret from that terrible time. Now she has returned ... as Chief of Police. She thought she had come to terms with the past. Until the body of a young woman who had been tortured, raped, and killed by exsanguination is dumped in a farmers field. This is only the first of several brutal murders. All of the murders appear to be the work of the Slaughterhouse Killer. The evidence seems indisputable. But Kate believes she knows why the killings stopped sixteen years ago. She vows to get at the truth even if it means the truth could destroy her. But while she and her small police department work around the clock trying to solve the murders she is forced to deal with the mayor and town council. They believe she is overwhelmed and too inexperienced to deal with a serial killer. She reluctantly calls in Sheriff Nathan Detrick and the Holmes County Sheriff's Department. Then the politicians call in Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCI) and they send field agent John Tomasetti. Kate is trying to work with outside agencies and deal with politicians and meanwhile the killings continue and their brutality escalates.This is the first book in the Kate Burkholder series. It was a fun and enjoyable read. Much of the book was a constant page turner, one more chapter reading experience which I enjoy in suspense and thriller novels. I was able to correctly identify the serial killer but that did not detract from an enjoyable reading experience and I look forward to reading other books in this series. Great characters. Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28831526-jean", "userReview": "Sworn to Silence begins with a horrific murder. A young woman is tortured, raped, and killed \u2013 exsanguinated \u2013 and her body is dumped in a field where a police deputy finds it.Kate Burkholder is a young, ex-Amish woman. As police chief in her hometown of Painter\u2019s Mill, Ohio, she commands a small force and must investigate the murder. There is a detail, however, that only the police know: Roman numerals carved in the victim\u2019s abdomen. Has a serial killer returned? Is Kate in over her head?Kate hides a deep, dark secret from years ago when she was a 14-year-old girl. Only her estranged brother and sister know the truth. Is her secret related to the brutal murders terrorizing Painter\u2019s Mill once again?4 starsAgent John Tomasetti of the BCI could be on his last case. He is hooked on booze and pain pills, and he has declined an offer of early retirement. His assignment to Painter\u2019s Mill is a sink or swim situation\u2013 and his superiors are betting on the former. Chief Burkholder resents his presence as well. Do they remain at odds, or do they find a way to work together to solve the case?Two officers of the law with heavy personal baggage and a race against time. Can they catch the killer before more young women die?Castillo creates tension using wintry scenes with snowstorms and impassible roads, conflicts between Chief Burkholder, the town council and the sheriff, and within Kate\u2019s own mind as she struggles with the skeleton in her childhood closet. Overall, Castillo did a good job of keeping me absorbed in the story, and I had only a slight inkling of who the killer might be (almost at the same time Kate begins to put it together). This was my first time reading Linda Castillo, and I enjoyed this book very much. The major problem for me was that Kate did not seem the least bit Amish to me. Yes, she had rebelled and had been shunned by her community when she was 18. Not infrequently, she is derided as an \u201cAmish bitch.\u201d Other than displaying understanding and sympathy for her Amish family and neighbors, I did not detect the remains of Amish-ness in her. It seemed to me that she would feel more ambiguity or seem less \u201cEnglish\u201d than she is portrayed after only a dozen or so years away from the Amish community. However, I did find her quite likable and otherwise very human with both her intelligence and her flaws and the way that she relates to her officers. Tomasetti is even more flawed, but when he teams up with Kate, he begins to find himself again, and I suspect that he reappears in subsequent books.I definitely plan to read the next Chief Kate Burkholder novel, as I think this is an excellent beginning to a wicked good series."}, {"userName": "Fictionophile ", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428094-fictionophile", "userReview": "Wow!
