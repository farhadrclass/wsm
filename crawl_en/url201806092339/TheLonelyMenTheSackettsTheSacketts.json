The story is good and I've always liked Tell Sackett. This is the third featuring him and L'Amour is a better storyteller with each new book. The only trouble is, the first book featuring Tell ended with him together with Ange. And I adore Ange. So in the previous Tell book, L'Amour had to pack her off back East for some mysterious reason and that sucked. In this one, L'Amour kills her off. Off-screen, in the pre-story, in a big dustup that he may have intended to get to sometime but apparently never has (because I'm reading in chronological order, remember***). And that just sucks!And yeah, I like Dorset, the new honey for Tell, but she's awful thin on the pages in this one, floating in and out of the story just enough to hint at her inner awesome. This is the problem with being a romantic reading the Sackett novels, I suppose...Even worse, though, we get more of Owen's not-yet-ex wife, Laura. She's a cartoon villain from Tyrel's story and does herself no favors here. Her machinations drive much of the story, sending Tell into Apache territory on a goose-chase. I can't actually regret it because he rescues folks and meets Dorset, but still, she's a stone-cold bitch and seriously needs to go away (preferably permanently, though not necessarily fatally).So yeah. Pique. It's still a good adventure story and Tell is awesome. Poor Ange. If L'Amour has similar treatment for Dorset later on, I may just give this up as a bad experiment...***Edit: well crap! It turns out the series listing here on GoodReads isn't in chronological order. Gah. So looks like I need an emergency intervention for The Sackett Brand. This may sour me on L'Amour, altogether...****Edited Edit: I changed the ordering here on GoodReads to reflect the much better chronology given at http://www.louislamour.com/sackett/in....

The book starts out as Tell Sackett is pinned down by the Apaches in a land so bare that there isn\u2019t anything around him except for barren desert. He escapes and moves on to a little town called Tucson where his Sister in law, Laura Sackett tells him that his nephew has been kidnapped by the Apaches and asks him to go into the heart of Apache territory to find him. Will he make it out alive and with his nephew or will he die all alone in the desolate desert? \tThe Lonely Men is a very good book. I think this book is valuable because it has a unique plot. It seems to me that there aren't as many western books as their are other genres so it makes this book a small treasure. The only slow part was when he was in Tucson waiting for his sister in law I thought that part was particularly slow. One part that I really liked about this book was the author's perspective about Native Americans. He didn\u2019t portray them as people with feathers in their headbands who were primitive and inferior to the white settlers. He made them equals to the main characters. This book has a wonderful way of connecting to the reader. In the book some of Tell\u2019s close friends die. We have all had a friend or family member pass away and this connected perfectly to the sadness that followed. This book left me satisfied with the ending and happy with the overall book. \tThe theme of this book is that through perseverance and hard work we can achieve what we set out to do. One example of this is when Tell has to ride multiple days and nights without sleep. Part of which was in the whipping rain and then in the scalding heat of the day to escape from the Apaches. It would have been much easier to have not gone at all or to have given up when things got tough, but he didn't. He didn\u2019t back down and he achieved what he set out to do. This doesn't only apply to the book it also applies to real life. If you stick with it you will succeed."}, {"userName": "Barbara Lee Wood", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56675669-barbara-lee-wood", "userReview": "FOUR FRIENDSThis adventure has a good side and bad side. William Tell Sackett, and friends Tampico, Spanish Murphy, John J. Battles these men accompanied Tell thru Apache country to rescue his nephew who per his sister in law Laura Pritts Sackett was kidnapped to Mexico. This was a lie, the sister in law was angry with Tell's brother Orrin, a lawyer who moved back to Washington, D.C. Of course Tell wasn't aware of this situation, since he didn't write much, better still he had a hard time reading, which was uncommon in that era. Especially if your families main concern is to keep food on the table and a roof over their families head, education wasn't the families first priority.Tell rescued four white kids from the Apache mountain retreat. One of the kids was with the Apache for two years, he told Tell what he saw and there wasn't any young boy he was looking for in this village. Well now that they've rescued the kids, the return trip will be a true test of the strength of these four hard living men. Tell eventually makes it to a ranch owned a Mexican Don, who gives them all a safe sanctuary. That's when he's told that he was sent to his death, because there wasn't any kidnapped nephew...Tell felt there was something wrong, but couldn't understand why Orrin's ex-wife wanted him dead.On that note, this is a great western story by the greatest western writer, Louis L'Amour....cha cha.Exposes how deep anger, hatred goes and how it feeds the fire of REVENGE. He gives you both sides of the coin..you know..The Indians side and the White men; why they are having a hard time accepting change, which is coming whether they agree or not..Lots of helpful history if you want to believe it or not..Mr L'Amour preserves what he has seen through his travels, and pass it on to the readers...."}, {"userName": "Oleta Blaylock", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2805345-oleta-blaylock", "userReview": "I swear if it wasn't for bad luck William Tell Sackett wouldn't have any luck at all. The man can get into more trouble in less time than any two other men. He is also a little to trusting of women. That is probably because he hasn't had much experience with them. However, Orrin has had quite a bit of experience with woman and he isn't any better at seeing through their wiles.Tell is approached by Orrin's ex-wife Laura and she tells him that Orrin's son has been kidnapped by the Apaches. Tell sets out to find the boy and bring him home. At this point in time most of the Apaches were holing up in Mexico in the Sierra Madres. It is a dangerous mission but Tell just can't leave the boy to fin for himself.The story is one running battle with the Apaches. It doesn't help that Laura Pritts Sackett is coming up with more ways for Tell to die. She is determined to get him killed. This is one mean spirited woman there isn't a single good bone in her body. As with the other Tell Sackett stories I enjoyed this one. I love learning about the different countrysides that he travels through as well as the history of the time. I also appreciate that L'Amour never paints the Indian as an evil man. He is just a man that has been raised with a different set of values. All the Sacketts believe this and they talk about it through all the books. I would like to see Tell finally find some peace. He has been through so much and deserves to find a happy and fruitful life."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5802091-jean", "userReview": "This is another book in the Sackett series and features Tell Sackett.

So when she informs Tell there's a young Sackett who has been kidnapped by Apaches, he believes her and off he goes. It is a fun book, full of adventure and wonderful descriptions of the land. Tell is one of my favorite Sackett characters and his observations are always interesting. The only problem is the book is short! It tells the story, though. It is just me wanting to spend more time there.If you like traditional Westerns, you've probably already read this book.

Part of the Sackett series, this volume follows the adventures of Tel Sackett as he attempts to rescue a nephew from Apache country. What most interested me in this work are the two half-baked theories L\u2019Amour throws out to defend his pro-Cowboy stance. Tel muses that Apaches drove a tribe out of their territory to occupy the land they currently hold, so it is the way of history for the white man to drive the Indians out.

You bet he does! When the wife of Tell\u2019s brother, Orrin, approaches Tell with the news that her son has been kidnapped by the Apache\u2019s, he doesn\u2019t even have to think twice.What poor old trusting Tell doesn\u2019t know, is that Laura and Orrin are not even married anymore, and furthermore they never had a child together. It seems that Orrin and Tyrell Sackett played a major role in busting up Laura\u2019s father\u2019s crooked operations a while back, and ran him right out of the country. Still nursing a grudge against the whole Sackett clan, Laura has finally cooked up a scheme to get revenge. Tell knows none of this, however, so he and three of his trusted companions go riding off, deep into Apache territory.The four courageous men manage to find the Indian camp where several white children are being held. Tell\u2019s nephew is not one of them, however, and the rescuers begin to suspect Laura. There\u2019s no time to worry about that now, though. Tell and his partners are spotted taking the children and it\u2019s going to be an all-out race for the border.Meanwhile, Laura is beginning to worry. She never imagined Tell would make it out alive, but what if he does? As a precaution, she hires an enemy of Tell\u2019s to keep a lookout. If Tell and his group make it back alive, the hired killer will be laying for them.Of all the Sacketts, Tell is my favorite, and \nThe Lonely Men\n is a good example of why. Tell knew he was probably on a suicide mission, but he did it anyway because his family is more important to him than his own life. Many of the Sackett audiobooks tell about various Sacketts riding into a new town, butting heads with the local bullies, and running them out, but \nthe Lonely Men\n was different. This time it was Tell against the Apache, who are not really bad guys but just trying to adapt. Tell will kill Indians if he absolutely has to, but mostly he respects them as brave warriors.I can\u2019t imagine anyone doing a better job reading Louis L\u2019Amour\u2019s audiobooks than David Strathairn. His no-nonsense style of narration matches L\u2019Amour\u2019s no-nonsense writing perfectly.\nThe Lonely Men\n is one of my favorite Sackett audiobooks so far. I came to Louis L\u2019Amour\u2019s books as a skeptic, not being a fan of westerns, but he has won me over. L\u2019Amour really has a way with words: he gets his point across very succinctly without rambling on and on. \nThe Lonely Men\n is highly recommended.Steven Brandt @ Audiobook-Heaven"}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11566365-ed", "userReview": "#12 in the Sackett series chronologically (#8 in publication order). Had he lived long enough, author L'Amour planned his Sackett series to have over 40 novels spanning the 17th through 19th Centuries. As it happened, of the 17 novels he did write in the saga, 4 take place from 1600-1620, one in the 1840s-1850s, and the other 12 occur in the 1870s. The current entry, from 1969, is one of the 8 that are placed in the period 1875-1879. Tell Sackett, accompanied by three trail partners, gets a note from Laura Sackett telling him his nephew has been kidnapped by Apaches and asking for help. Tell doesn't know that Laura and his brother Orrin had a bitter divorce and that he has no nephew; this is Laura's plot to seek revenge against the Sackett name.Sackett Titles #12 - Tell Sackett had fought his share of Indians and managed to take something of value from his battles: a deep and abiding respect. But that respect is lost when Apache braves kidnap his nephew, forcing Tell to cross the border into the Sierra Madres to bring the boy back.
