I don\u2019t mean I have really followed his career or anything, but years ago I picked up a cassette tape (remember those?) of a message he gave off the bargain rack at my local Christian bookstore. The message was called Super Sheep and despite not having heard it in years I remember the things Ken said, his depth and his humor. Okay, so I got one of those minds that actually remembers sermons (I\u2019m a freak of nature) but you can ask my wife, she\u2019s heard the tape and she remembers it too and she doesn\u2019t have one of those minds. Later I found I video of his called A Wimpy Prophet, A Butane Bush and No Exuses on VHS (remember those?) which was also really funny and inspiring.So when the opportunity to review this book came up I jumped at the chance and had them send me a print copy (remember those?) My previous experience with Ken Davis was with him as a speaker and he was dynamic with impeccable comedic timing. I wanted to see what kind of author he was and found this book inspiring. However I read the book way too fast so his comedic timing was all off. Well not totally, but this book seems to be a different animal than my previous exposure to Davis.The book begins with the tale of a camping trip with his wife and grandchildren where his granddaughter Jaydn gets lost in the wilderness. Davis panics and the hunt for Jaydn begins. When a couple of hikers find Jaydn, her words to them is \u201cMy grandpa is lost.\u201d This becomes a metaphor for Davis of the ways he\u2019s let his life drift off purpose. When he sees a picture of himself at 240+ lbs with his granddaughter at the beach, he exclaims, \u201cNooooo! Walking Manatee!!!\u201d and begins the process of taking hold of his life and really living.This is a book about not wasting your life by walking around like you are half dead. Davis encourages his readers to lose weight, get in shape, take risks, make deep friendships and care for your family and attend to spiritual health and our relationship with Jesus. What I liked about this book is Davis\u2019s vulnerability with his own struggles through depression, struggle and self-doubt. He opens up about the struggles he has had to accept himself, but also shares the \u2019stakes in the ground\u2019 in his life which have revealed to him all that he was meant to be.I am a several years younger than Davis but I have had my own \u201cNoooo! Manatee!\u201d moment. When I graduated with my M.Div from Regent College it was the biggest academic and personal achievement of my adult life. I was proud of myself for finishing, but when I saw pictures of myself kneeling to receive my graduate hood, I saw that I weighed more than I ever have. And I felt terrible. I was slow, sluggish and had no energy. Within six months of that picture I had lost 50 lbs by running, swimming and watching my food intake. I have since gained some of that weight back (but no where near all), but some lifestyle changes I made were permanent and I have felt better for it.Still, some of Davis\u2019s exhortation to take risks and live life to the fullest speak to me. I have, as of yet, to find a ministry position (what I went to school for, and the calling and deep passion of my life). I am currently working at a hardware/animal supply store to pay the bills and provide for my family, but I am still feeling like my life is stuck and I am not doing what I was put on the earth to do. As I read Davis\u2019s book I am encouraged and hunger for more out of life, and more of what God has for me.I would describe this book as inspirational self-help. If you are in need of a gentle (but firm) swift kick in the rear, this might be a good book for you. If you feel like you are living life to the fullest, you might want to pass this by. When I mentioned Fully Alive\u2019s contents to my wife she said, \u201cI think we are already pretty much fully alive.\u201d This is not a book for her. But if you look in the mirror and feel like you look dead and . . .well, manatee-ish, this may be the book for you. Or if you feel like you can\u2019t do anything of value anymore because you are too old, Davis has lots to say to the old folks. Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing me with a copy of this book via Booksneeze in exchange for this fair and exceptional review."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5741286-cheryl", "userReview": "This book gave me mixed emotions in more than one way.Overall, Fully Alive made me both cry and laugh out loud. I appreciate both reactions and felt especially pleased when I reminded myself that, laughter truly is good medicine.Another reason I had mixed emotions was because for quite a while as I read through this book I thought I had been tricked or deceived into what it was all about\u2014what the topic or category of book this was. All the summaries that I had read from the publisher about this book said nothing about weight loss or fitness. It isn\u2019t the topic that got me upset. I love that topic, being a weight loss coach! It was that it was so unexpected, kind of stuck in there in the middle, and several chapters of it.After I got over the shock of this unexpected topic inclusion I realized that this book was at least partly beneficial for fitness motivation. That is a wonderful thing if that is what you need. And now, dear readers, you don\u2019t need to be unexpectedly surprised by this topic inclusion. In fact, if you are in need of fitness motivation this is a very worthwhile book!TO READ THE *REST* OF MY REVIEW PLEAS VISIT:http://www.cherylcope.com/book-review..."}, {"userName": "Pilar", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1212827-pilar", "userReview": "I admit, I didn't know who Ken Davis was before reading Fully Alive. So, it was especially sweet getting to know him by reading his story. Ken Davis shares his struggles and triumphs in his life's journey. He doesn't hide anything. He is candid and open in relaying details of his life.Have you felt depressed or unmotivated lately? Have you been thinking about getting back in shape, but think it's impossible? Do you feel old and listless? Are you just going through the motions in life? Have you thought, is this all there is?If you answered 'yes' to any of the above questions, I strongly urge you to get this book.

Thomas Nelson, 2012.Exciting book of a life fully transformed both physically and spiritually. Full of humorous anecdotes which makes it a fast read and a joyful delight. Ken shares his journey from the \u201cNOOOOO manatee\u201d photo to a svelte 65 yr old man who shed over 80 lbs as well as found his spiritual life re-energized as well. It is a fast read and the laughter you erupt with as you read is truly a prescriptive medicine from which all will benefit. I loved every page! Two take aways from this book are two quips he uses: \u201cMost Christians have moss growing on their butts\u201d and \u201cThe spirit of fear is in-fear-ior to the Spirit of Christ who lives in us\u201d. I doubt I will ever forget those which are tucked in with his experiences as he shares his journals and thoughts as he moved from depression to expression!"}, {"userName": "Joseph Young", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62568288-joseph-young", "userReview": "The first few chapters were excellent! Very inspiring! After that it kind of slowed down to a crawl and dragged along, eventually becoming a discourse into why its important to take care of your body and dieting. The information was all good and fine, but the later part of the book really seemed to lose its gusto.

Tubes and wires protrude from his feeble body and wind their way to massive machines on either side of the bed. The lights on the machine and the bouncing bubble that displays the heartbeat give evidence to the fact that this man is indeed alive. But is he living?A Christian trudges through life doing what must be done to get by. Upon examining his actions, one of two conclusions can be reached: (1) He has arrived at where he wants to be in life and has grown comfortable in that state; (2) He has despaired at ever arriving at where he wants to be in life and has grown comfortable with his uncomfortableness. Either way, his life consists of getting through another day. There's no doubt this man is alive. But is he living?In his newest book, Fully Alive, Christian author and speaker, Ken Davis explains how to tell the difference between being alive and truly living fully alive. Davis delves into his personal experiences and illustrates for us the milestones God placed in his life to take him from a state of being alive to a state of fully living. Through his thorough explanations and intriguing questions, he enables the reader to evaluate his/her own life and state of living. And even though Ken Davis is most well-known for his Christian comedy, this book will make you cry. In fact, it provides a message that will have you laughing and wiping tears from your eyes at the same time. But I assure you, it is a message you will want to hear!This book has changed my life. I firmly believe God has used Fully Alive, in conjunction with some other teachings, to pull me out of a rut. I was like the Christian in scenario #2, despairing of ever reaching my life's goals and dreams. I had grown comfortable with my disappointment and discouragement, and in doing so, I had given up on life. I was going through the motions day in and day out, but there was no life in me. I had no joy. I found no delight in the things I was doing, even the things I was doing for the Lord. I was enduring life, but I wasn't enjoying it. Life was happening to me, but I wasn't living.When I read the description of this book, I knew it was something I wanted to read. Besides, it was written by Ken Davis, so I knew it couldn't be bad. I had no idea how much it would impact my life. From the first page, I found myself nodding my head and saying, \"Yes, I know what you mean. You've just described my life.\" And while most pages spoke comfort to my weary soul, I must admit some points stomped quite firmly on my toes. However, after I soothed my wounded pride and studied out the things that had offended me, I realized that Davis was absolutely right. God used his words to open my eyes to things I had been blinded to for some time.I have every intention of going back through this book again. It is so full of good information that it simple cannot be processed by reading through it once. Nevertheless, I have already begun to implement some of the principles I learned through this great work. I'm tired of just being alive. I'm ready to live! And thanks to Davis' willingness to open up his heart and share his personal struggles, I now have an action plan. I finally see the light. . . and it's not the one at the end of the tunnel.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze\u00ae.com  book review bloggers program.

This time of year always brings about a time of reflection, at least for me. A reflection on how I lived in the previous 12 months and how I hope to live in the coming 12 months. I think on what I need to change in order live better.Ken Davis had a \u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u201d photo that changed his life. He was obese, depressed and knew if anything happened to one of his grandchildren he would be completely unable to help. He calls it his \u201cnooooooooooo\u201d picture, he says he looked like a walking Manatee, he was afraid to lie on the beach. He thought the environmentalist would mistake him for a beached whale and roll him back to the water.Fully Alive is his journey to a place of healing, health and restoration. He shares how he got physically fit, emotionally, mentally and spiritually fit. And it all involves risk.I like to think of myself as a healthy person. I\u2019m in my mid-40s and I exercise at least twice a week. I was shooting for 3 times but life happens.Hah! No more. I wasn\u2019t challenging myself. I just read a book written by a man who is 65 years old and he exercises for ONE HOUR 6 days a week. I thought I was doing good with 90 minutes of exercise a week. (Please know, I KNOW 90 minutes a week is not bad.) I am an active person throughout the week but I could be better.I am now on a mission to be FULLY ALIVE in all aspects of my life. And I\u2019m starting NOW! I do not want to be a person who died at 25 and wasn\u2019t buried until I\u2019m 75. I want to live, fully alive, fully engaged in all that God has for me. I want to be willing to risk. I want to challenge myself. I want to deepen my love and my relationship with the God who created the universe. I want to deepen existing friendships. I want to gain new ones. I want to make sure I have at least 6 friends, close enough to carry my casket when I slide into death, completely used up. Okay to understand that, you\u2019ll have to read the book.Who is with me?

I thought this book to be a high value Christ centered motivational book . This book takes you through all the many reasons why Ken Davis felt improvements were needed in his life so that he could live Fully Alive. I thought the book really great for motivating anyone who is unsatisfied with the're lives they way they are going and it shows us step by step how to regain what we lost.Each chapter is great and you will learn a new strategy with every page. I think that this book would make for an awesome gift for Christians and non Christian's alike because it does not come off as preachy and is strong on motivation and will not read like a church sermon.Fully Alive by Ken Davis is very Christ centered and its got so much helpful advice on how to get going and reclaim your life so you can feel fully alive. There is motivation for just about everything from loosing weigh , getting older, loss of spirit and depression and a whole lot more. I recommend this book to anyone suffering in a rut or the blahs ,its filled with humor and will lift your spirits just buy reading it.Recently I started thinking along the same lines and Ken and implemented my own changes toward health and joy I am more centered in my walk with Christ and had I read this book than my journey would have been easier. If you are looking to make changes in your life for what ever reason I think this would be a great book for you to read or even give as a gift to a loved one who could use the encouragement. I love the way its written for everyone but with a solid foundation of faith and belief that in Christ all thing are possible."}, {"userName": "Cindy Navarro", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4037928-cindy-navarro", "userReview": "This book came along just when I needed it. It is filled with encouraging stories, practical ideas, and humor. Throughout the book, Ken tells the reader that there is so much more to life than just existing until death. Age, poor health, obesity, depression, retirement: whether you are facing all, some, or even a different set of obstacles, there is hope to LIVE as long as you breathe. Actually, Ken encourages you to breathe hard as you give all you have in life. When circumstances are crushing your spirit, shove back. This is a book that will inspire you to find the passion you once had to enjoy every moment instead of shuffling slowly with your head bowed in defeat. It may be a step-by-step or moment-by-moment progress...but make the effort to move!! Fear can either paralyze you or it can get your heart pumping and your legs moving.

I did enjoy some of his stories from his life.

I listened to this as an audiobook which is narrated by the author. This is doubly useful as the author is also an accomplished speaker and given the subject and desire to inspire it gives it authenticity. Authenticity is still a wee challenge as the delivery is \"American\" (An odd adjative to Americans I accept, but to non Americans, like me, I am sure it translates). But I got over myself here and listened to Ken's messages. And they are good. As a confirmed atheist messages around God were again challenging for me.

Fully Alive explores the idea that God is glorified when man is \u201cfully and eternally alive,\u201d illustrated by best-selling author and motivational speaker Ken Davis\u2019s most honest and intimate stories.
