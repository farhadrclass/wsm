Therefore, my review is colored by my knowledge of how the rest of the series is. Hence, I only give this book 4 stars because in comparison to the rest of the series, I thought this book was by far the weakest. In a vacuum, I would have probably given this 5 stars due to the \u201cChilly Palmer/Josey Wales\u201d awesomeness of the character of Roland. *** Roland Deschain is THE MAN and belongs among the truly ICONIC figures in 20th century literature and is certainly among my top ten favorite characters of all time. I think this is even more astounding given the Roland himself was initially patterned on the classic, iconic western gunfighter. Yet, through the series, I thought he grew beyond his original programming and became a truly unique figure. *** I have read a number of Stephen King books beyond the Dark Tower series and have really liked some (The Stand, The Green Mile, The Night Shift) and really disliked some (Dreamcatcher, Cujo and The Dark Half). I just wanted to be clear that I like Stephen King but am not a \u201ceverything he writes is gold\u201d fanboy\u2026..beyond the Dark Tower series that is. *** I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the ending of the series (don\u2019t worry, no spoilers). I can not think of a better way to have ended this epic series and believe that it created a much more powerful memory of the journey through all 7 books. I think Stephen King should be applauded for allowing the story to take on such \u201cMYTHIC\u201d importance as I think he achieved with the way he ended this series. I know that MANY (and I mean MANY) disagree with me on this one and I can understand where they are coming from\u2026\u2026.(psssst however, just between us\u2026.they are all wrong and I\u2019m right\u2026but shhhhhh). *** I have listened to all 7 books are audio (the first 4 read by the late Frank Muller and the last 3 read by George Guidall). I believe that anyone who has read the books and not listened to these stories on audio is REALLY MISSING SOMETHING WONDERFUL. Those who have listened to the \u201cDune\u201d series on audio can understand the incredible quality and enhancement that a superb reading of a great story can bring. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.As mentioned in the above introduction, this book only gets 4 stars from me. In large part this is due to both the quality of the later books and also the fact that it is plagued by some inconsistencies that arose due to changes that King made in the later books. I applaud King for going back and re-writing this story to resolve these conflicts, but I still think this book suffers from the fact that King did not know how LARGE the story would become when he wrote this. That said, this book is an absolute essential read as it introduced the world to Roland Deschain of Gilead, Son of Steven, Gunslinger, Champion of the White, Descendant of the line of Arthur Eld, Bane of the Man in Black and Seeker of the Dark Tower. How best to describe Roland? Physically, he was inspired by Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cThe Man with No Name\u201d and so a younger Clint Eastwood is an excellent way to visualize him. \n...From there, you need to mix in a little MYSTICAL TEACHER/WARRIOR/MASTER SLOGAN DISPENSER:\n....Add a helping of NOBLE KNIGHT LEADER:\n...And then top it off with a large triple shot of BAD ASS MOFO:\n...\u2026..with the end result being one of the most intriguing, layered (though it takes some time to peel those layers back) and complex figures in all of literature(in my opinion). In this first installment, which is quite short compared to subsequent volumes we are introduced to Roland and the world he lives in as he is chasing the Man in Black. Roland\u2019s world appears like a deranged version of the Old West but with occasional references to an older world that was much more technologically advanced. We are left with the impression of a very ancient world that is fading and running down. As Roland describes it, his world \u201chas moved on.\u201dWe also come to find that Roland\u2019s world is not \u201cour world\u201d but that there are strange similarities between the two (e.g., Arthur Eld the great hero of Roland\u2019s world would seem to be their version of King Arthur; both world\u2019s have a version of the song \u201cHey Jude\u201d, etc.). In addition, we learn that it is possible (though difficult) to travel between the worlds which is a fundamental aspect of the rest of the series. It is in this story that Roland first meets Jake Chambers who arrives in Roland\u2019s world from a version of \u201cour\u201d New York City. I will leave you to learn for yourself the circumstances surrounding Jake\u2019s appearance and the results Through a lengthy flashback in the city of JethroTull we learn of both the mad skills of Roland as a Gunslinger and the otherworldly powers of the Man in Black. My takeaway, Roland can shoot the eyes out of hummingbird and 50 paces. From there, the book moves ahead briskly until the inevitable final showdown between Roland and the Man in Black. The details, the interesting nuggets and the time spent with Jake are best experienced fresh so I will avoid spoilers. Overall, a good introduction to Roland and his world but merely an appetizer to the warm buttery goodness that is to follow and the epic tale of the Gunslinger really gets going in the next book. \u201cThe man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed\u2026.\u201d And you should follow to, all the way to the end of the story and discover the wonders of this most original journey. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!."}, {"userName": "Chelsea Humphrey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47207032-chelsea-humphrey", "userReview": "Please don't hate me. I know it seems sacrilegious to give a Stephen King anything less than 4 stars, but this one was SLOOOOWWWW for the first 75%. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, but I did find this was an easy book to put down and not feel an urgency to jump back into for days at a time. I've heard many folks describe this as a nice prologue to the series and that, in a sense, the action and story doesn't become investment worthy until book 2. That, coupled with the fact that I did become very involved in the final 25% or so of this book has me itching to continue on with Roland because DEAR GOD THAT ENDING!!! I was just coasting, coasting, coasting, and then then I had to reread the final couple of pages a few times to make sure I was following along properly. All in all, I got the sense that this is a really special series and worthy of the high praise it has received for decades, and I expect my future reviews will hold more gushing and fangirling than this one did.  PS- my prim and proper mother (we lovingly refer to her as Nonni) is the one who initially convinced me to read this series and also invest in The Stand because she read both way back in her day.

As a result, I was not surprised to find a high degree of pretension in Roland\u2019s debut appearance (not to mention what seemed like thousands of unnecessary adverbs). I removed as much of this hollow blather as I could,...\u201dYes, that's why I hate most new authors work, but really young King here followed the rules very hard..And it doesn't seem as if he really removed much.The ambiguity here was in the character of the Gunslinger, who by half of the book you'd get to know some glimpse of his childhood past and coming of age.He kills, he travel for totally unknown reason till the end of this volume\u2026Following another ambiguous Man in Black who's ambiguity evil and the reason he killed a whole small town.Meeting ambiguity Boy killed in our real world and somehow he's alive in this ambitious world...which is even not the Gunslinger\u2019s original world.A world with wired Mutants, men with birds heads, while the Gunslinger world is even weirder.Do you have an even small explanation on anything?No.\u201cStephen King, on the foreword;Although I\u2019ve spent an inordinate amount of time writing these books in the thirty-three years between 1970 and 2003, comparatively few people have read them.\u201d No wonder, simply because this book defy the rules of First Book of a Series..Too ambiguous...dry dry lines for a supposed epic fantasy..I don't believe anyone felt liking \u201cRonald, The Gunslinger\u201d nor being okay with travelling with a dead boy \u201cJack\u201d, or would get tense that something bad may befall him...he's already dead for God's sakes..brutal death as it is.It's hard to love the characters if you don't understand them well enough\u2026-----------I'm not a fan of extreme fantasy, I love ASOIAF and Harry Pottet cause both more real than extreme fantasy, But till now I can't force myself reading Lord of the Rings..I loved the movies, And I loved the short \u201cHobbit\u201d novel, it's short and the writing style is amazing but that's all.Here's extreme strange ambiguous world and characters...in dry 19 years old writing by the rules of \u201chow to be Shakespeare\u201d, with all the strange old and weird language. and the 238 pages felt like 832 pages.I find myself fast reading many lines, still I got it all..it's not too much stuff happening anyway. When now I have read the Wikipedia to write the review I find out the Summary ia totally enough, read it instead of this book and you're done with it.\u201cStephen King, on the foreword;The Gunslinger did not even sound like the later books\u2014it was, frankly, rather difficult to read. All too often I heard myself apologizing for it, and telling people that if they persevered, they would find the story really found its voice in The Drawing of the Three.\u201d Well, Only 4 pages by the last chapter can gives u a glimpse of this tower request\u2026 it evolves God, religion, technology, creation, since...etc.That's what I most cared for...that's the best scene of all the book..Alas, The Man in Black doesn't know much anyway, so is The Gunslinger..So do I, so do you if you only get yourself finishing this book.I believe this book could have been way better if was just half the pages, and included in book two as 2 parts in one book.It was 5 short stories once published separated. .God that'd have been awful.. Only the last one though making a bit good promise to an interesting adventure to come. If this last one \"The Gunslinger and the Dark Man\" came second in order of chapters that may have been at least better improvement.I've read the preview of Book Two that included here..it was 12 pages of same prolonged one man tedious walk..till the mysterious door appears and that's when everything may change for way better adventure set in our real world..I may love it I guess., may be when I read the next 2 books -but they're in detention till next February, the Movie release- may be then I'd appreciate this first book more.So, till next February then.Mohammed ArabeyFrom 5 Aug. 2016To 8 Aug. 2016Next King Stop, The Stand"}, {"userName": "Luca Ambrosino", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53478239-luca-ambrosino", "userReview": "ENGLISH (The Gunslinger) / ITALIANOWhen I read this novel more than twenty years ago, I did not appreciate it. Clearly, Roland's story did not charmed enough my distracted and teenage mind. Therefore, I decided to prematurely stop the \"The Black Tower\" series. A few days ago in a bookstore I stumbled on a copy of the new edition of \"The Gunslinger\", and reading the preface I understood a couple of things. FIRST: not just myself, but also Stephen King was young when he wrote the same edition of \"The Gunslinger\" that I read eons ago. SECOND: to overcome the incomplete literary maturity possessed at that time, Stephen King thought to revise and enrich the original novel, publishing a new edition that for simplicity I will define \"more mature\". In fact, in that preface King confesses that when he starts writing a novel, he has no idea where he's going with this, let alone when he stars to write a multi-volume saga! In this light, the rearrangement of \"The Gunslinger\", done only after completing the last episode of \"The Black Tower\", was necessary.The plot is simple. Roland is a gunslinger and chases the man in black. The deadly desert dominates on them. Some meetings take place along the way, new characters come into play, while flashbacks clarify the gunslinger's past. In my opinion the most beautiful parts of the novel are precisely Roland's memories, which begin to roughly make us understand the meaning of \"The Black Tower\". King give us the only hint about the time of the facts practically at the end:\u00abGunslinger, our fathers conquered the-disease-which-rots, which we call cancer, almost conquered aging, went to the moon...\u00bb, indicating that we are in a vague future, far from our day. The air we breathe is suggestive and desolate. Making an example that only the fans of Garth Ennis will catch, the atmosphere resembles the one created by the British comic artist when describing the events of the Saint of Killers, one of the key characters of his famous graphic novel \"Preacher\".Although some details escape me at the moment, I expect a lot from this saga. I think this novel is a kind of introduction that I will fully understand after the next volumes, and probably I will return to these reflections once again in the future to update my personal judgment of \"The Gunslinger\". For now, I trust the positive reviews of the next volumes. Overall I trust the positive reviews of \"The Black Tower\" series. But above all I trust the author who, more than anyone else, always stimulated my imagination. And that's not a small thing!My journey just started.Vote: 7Quando lessi questo romanzo pi\u00f9 di vent'anni fa, non ne fui entusiasta. Evidentemente la vicenda di Roland non aveva colpito abbastanza la mia mente distratta e adolescente. Decisi pertanto di non continuare la serie de \"La Torre Nera\". Qualche giorno fa mi sono imbattuto in libreria in una copia della nuova edizione de \"L'Ultimo Cavaliere\", e leggendone la prefazione vengo a conoscenza di un paio di cose. UNO: non solo il sottoscritto, ma anche il buon Stephen era giovane, molto giovane, quando scrisse l'edizione dell'ultimo cavaliere che lessi eoni fa. DUE: per ovviare alla non piena maturit\u00e0 letteraria posseduta all'epoca, il buon Stephen ha pensato bene di rivedere ed arricchire il romanzo originale, mandando alle stampe una nuova edizione che per semplicit\u00e0 definisco \"pi\u00f9 matura\". Difatti nella suddetta prefazione King confessa che quando inizia a scrivere un romanzo, non sa con precisione dove vuole andare a parare. Figuriamoci quando inizia a scrivere una saga di pi\u00f9 volumi! In quest'ottica, il rimaneggiamento de \"L'ultimo cavaliere\", fatto solo dopo aver completato l'ultimo episodio de \"La Torre Nera\", \u00e8 stato necessario.La trama \u00e8 semplice. Roland \u00e8 un pistolero ed insegue l'uomo in nero. Su di loro domina il deserto, torrido e letale. Lungo il cammino avvengono degli incontri, entrano in gioco nuovi personaggi, mentre flashback di ricordi chiariscono il passato del pistolero. Sono proprio i ricordi di Roland le parti pi\u00f9 belle secondo me, sono brani che cominciano grossolanamente a farci capire il senso della Torre Nera. L'unico indizio sull'epoca in cui avvengono i fatti lo si ottiene praticamente alla fine:\u00abPistolero, i nostri plurisnonni debellarono il morbo che fa marcire, quello che chiamavano cancro. Quasi debellarono la vecchiaia, camminarono sulla luna...\u00bb,ad indicare che ci troviamo in un futuro vago, lontano dai giorni nostri. L'aria che si respira \u00e8 suggestionante e desolata. Per fare un esempio che coglieranno solamente i fan di Garth Ennis, l'atmosfera somiglia molto a quella creata dal fumettista britannico quando descrive le vicende del \"Santo degli Assassini\", uno dei personaggi chiave della sua graphic novel \"Preacher\".Nonostante ci sono alcuni dettagli che mi sfuggono, mi aspetto molto da questa saga. Credo che questo romanzo sia una sorta di introduzione che comprender\u00f2 appieno dopo i volumi successivi, ed immagino che torner\u00f2 in futuro su queste riflessioni per aggiornare il mio personale giudizio de \"L'Ultimo Cavaliere\". Per ora mi fido delle recensioni positive dei prossimi volumi. Mi fido delle recensioni positive della serie \"La Torre Nera\" nella sua interezza. Ma soprattutto mi fido dell'autore che pi\u00f9 di tutti ha sempre stimolato la mia immaginazione. E scusate se \u00e8 poco.Il mio viaggio \u00e8 appena iniziato.Voto: 7"}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "An intriguing book, it draws the reader in little by little. It is fantastic, imaginative ... but inconsistent. Amid moments of brilliance there are also islands of abstraction so murky, almost Kafkaesque in absurdity, that I could not follow. But it is interesting enough that I will probably read the sequels. Of course that is another detraction, this book does not stand alone but leaves the reader with many questions unanswered. Fun questions that lead the reader to seek further, but a work of literature should be able to be read alone (with obvious, but genius exceptions!). The ideas of alternate realities and worlds within worlds are very interesting and King may be uniquely qualified, as a literary descendant of Lovecraft, Matheson and Blackwood to pull it off.****2015 amendment******\"The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed.\" The iconic opening lines have stayed with me for a couple of years and I find myself thinking about this series, and more specifically, what have I missed?

That is the line I remembered for years and years that made me think that someday I would revisit THE GUNSLINGER...As a young teenage girl I read THE GUNSLINGER and really didn't like it that much. I didn't hate it- it just confuuuuuused me. And to review this I will have to take you back to when I first read it as a teen...Stephen King is special to me. Special because when I first discovered him- it was the first time I went out on my own and read something that wasn't influenced by anyone but me. Before then my books were all hand me downs. Books I borrowed from my brother- like John D MacDonald's Travis McGee series, or Nancy Drew from my sister, Agatha Christie from my mother- My dad loved the classics, my friends VC Andrews. I enjoyed them all, but something told me- there was going to be an author that set me apart from the rest of my friends and family- books that were going to be alllllllllll mine.One night I watched the movie Dead Zone. In the credits it said written by Stephen King- and a whole new world opened up to me. I read Dead Zone, I read Salem's Lot. I read The Shining, The Stand...Firestarter...Carrie. I got used to his writing, and I was thrilled with it!!! Then I picked up THE GUNSLINGER and all hell broke loose. What the hell was this? It didn't fit. I didn't get it. It scared me that this was going to be what the rest of his books were going to be like. As a young girly girl I wanted nothing to do with westerns... I wanted nothing to do with Roland Deschain.Thankfully more Stephen King came out that made me happy...Christine, Pet Sematary. The Talisman, Thinner, It...and so many others. I forgot about The Dark Tower and THE GUNSLINGER and went about my merry way. But that line always stayed with me... The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed. ...Fast forward September 2014... two of my favorite Goodreads friends Stepheny and Jeff were reading about Roland- THE GUNSLINGER. I decided it was time I tried to get past my confusion and move forward. \"Can I join in?\" Of course you can...Let the buddy read begin.Roland Deschain travels across the desert with his mule in search of the man in black. There he comes across- Brown, a farmer, and Zoltan, his crow. Brown offers to put Roland up for the night...Roland's past becomes clearer as the story is told.His past in Gilead...In Tull...His meeting with Jake- a boy that Roland grows attached to- much to his dismay......And his future told by the man in black...Thank you Stepheny and Jeff for opening my eyes to a book I once dismissed.

When I think of this updated version like that, as slightly altered because it\u2019s a different cycle than the first time I read it, I like it a lot more.

This is where the master of horror writes his great work of fantasy based on a combination of The Lord of the Rings and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\"This simple and beautiful sentence is the opening line, the trademark and even the summary of The Gunslinger. In most ways, this single sentence is what defines this book.For that is how it all begins. The man in black flees across the desert, and the gunslinger follows. In the beginning, the reader has no idea who the man in black is, or even who the gunslinger is. You don't know where this desert is. You don't know why the gunslinger is following the man in black. And you don't know to what end they go. All you know when you start reading this book, is that he does follow him.This is one of those books where you don't get to know anything about anything when you start reading. The characters go by illusive names like 'the man in black' and 'the gunslinger'. The setting is... a desert. Nothing more. This had both a positive and a negative effect on my experience with the book. The negative thing is the fact that in the beginning, I understood absolutely nothing of what was going on, and didn't care at all about what happened to the characters. Why should I, when there was no way to tell who was the good guy, and who was the bad guy (except maybe the title of the book), and no characters had any relations to any other characters or places? The positive thing is that the book gets better and better the more you actually get to know. Eventually, you learn who the characters are, what secrets are hidden in their past, and where this dramatic chase is actually taking place.Thus arises one of the saving graces of this book: its main character. Roland Deschain, Roland of Gilead. Roland is one of those determined and silent protagonists allowing his guns to speak for him instead of his mouth. In most ways, he is reminiscent of Clint Eastwoods character in the famous Dollars trilogy, the Man With No Name (which is actually the author's intention).The writing is... strange. Yes, I think that would be the best way of describing it. King seems to switch constantly between simplicity and complexity when constructing his sentences, making some strange combinatory lines of long and impressive words and then irritating sounds like \"Yar\". That does not mean that the writing is bad, only perhaps that the style does not suit my tastes completely.Despite all that, I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of reading this book. The story of the Dark Tower series definitely appears to be quite interesting. It is hard to say anything more about it without including spoilers, but once I got to know a bit of what was happening, I was hooked. Also, since what irritated me the most was that I was thrown into the book without any kind of background knowledge (and didn't start to get it until I was halfway through), I think I might enjoy the the rest of the series more, when I've gotten to know the world in which the story takes place, and the characters featured in it.I will definitely continue reading this series. Whether or not I would recommend either the book or the series is too early to say. This book does absolutely not do as a standalone, and so I must take the next few books into account before I might say anything about that. But since I've repeatedly heard that this book is a lot weaker than its sequels, I'm obviously excited and quite optimistic about reading them.In the end, The Gunslinger unfortunately did not meet my expectations.

THE DARK TOWER obliterated my long-running book funk. I read all ten of the original series graphic novels, then I read the five from the spinoff.FIFTEEN graphic novels. In three days. Then I had to read the real thing. #cantstopwontstopYou: Why?B/c after reading all FIFTEEN of the graphic novels, Roland still hadn't made it to the tower. *bangs head against wall*And after reading THE DARK TOWER (the novel), I discovered that with the addition of a few flashbacks, probably from later installments, all TEN of the original series of graphic novels were based on this first installment of the books.They were pretty much the same story. Verbatim. Maybe that's common in this scenario. I don't know. I don't think I've read a graphic novelization of an existing book before. But here's the thing: whether it was the additional background or the gut-wrenching illustrations that accompanied Roland's trials and tribulations (of which there are many), he's a much more likable character in the graphic novels.In THE DARK TOWER (the novel) . . . Roland is kind of an ass. Not kind of. Really, really an ass.Which is a symptom of the bigger problem: there is a severe lack of character development.There was insta-love. You: In a Stephen King novel?Me: Not in the traditional sense, but YES. There was.You: O.oMe: I know, right?And that was after he went back and edited it for rerelease.

He is completely mesmerized by King\u2019s writing (rightly so) and I thought it will be a nice idea to tell him about the King\u2019s novel I\u2019ve been reading in the same time. My tentative to explain the plot of Gunslinger went kinda like this: a guy, a Gunslinger, travels through a desolated desert to catch a Man in Black, who is a sort of a sorcerer. The followed had something to do with the World moving On and the destruction of the follower\u2019s home. The Gunslinger reaches a house in the desert where he meets another guy and his talking crow. Over dinner he to that guy how he killed and entire town. Later, in some sort of a deserted building, he meets a child who is sent from the future/another world by the man in Black. Then\u2026spoilers, spoilers, spoilers. Confused much? I was and still am. What I am trying to say is that the Gunslinger is confusing and frustrating. If you like a straight, clear narrative where you understand whatever the hell is going on, this is not for you. The plot is strange, surreal, with some weird characters, some philosophy, blood, demons, witches and a very long tunnel. Kings himself admits that the novel is hard to understand and he tried to re-write some parts to make it more readable. He started to compose this at 19 and it is obvious that he is trying to prove to himself that he can write and he is trying too hard to sound smart. It might have been a strange read and at the end there were more questions than answers but I was hooked from the start by Kings writing and I can\u2019t wait to read the sequels. I have until 3rd of August (when the movie comes out) to read the 3500 pages left in the series so wish me luck. \uf04a***The trailer is here!

Or is it a post-apocalyptic western wasteland? Or is it a new world altogether? And moreover, Where did the burgers come from? Do they also serve French fries? What is the tax situation over there? Ummm, Sreyas, you are not making any sense. I am not making any sense?Have you read this book?For example, My man Roland the gunslinger walks into a township straight out of 19th century, steps into a bar with no electricity nor any modern amenities and asks for a..... wait for it..... burger. There are machines that can talk, there are sex deprived oracles and ghosts the haunt basements, and there are dialogues that made me question myself: Am I too sober to read this story? Should I eat a large quantity of sugar before reading this? I have to admit that this is a peculiar book. This is very different from the usual King stories and writing styles. The prose are unique (Read: Odd) and the slang is weird at times. I had fun while reading this book, but when I did pause to take a breath, the only thought I had was \n\"What the hell am I reading?!\"\n. And the moment I resumed reading the story, those thoughts simply faded away.That, my friend, must be magic!On the top of that, I am not sure what's more intriguing: The world of gunslinger or gunslinger himself!When I finished the book, I found that there was no mention of Crimson King, the primary antagonist of the series! That was when I found out that my edition is old! King revised the book in 2003 and added around 35 pages of new content to the story. So I borrowed my friend's Kindle and read the 2003 version too. I'm not sure which one is weirder! The revised Roland is less cold-blooded, I think. In the end, It all reminded me of the new Mad Max movie for some reason. You know, Apocalyptic wasteland, unreal locations, mad people, weird slang. To be exact, take Clint Eastwood and place him in Mad Max world (Minus the automobiles), then pick some supernatural elements and cook it up in a cauldron full of LSD, You get Gunslinger.

That being, the first time I read it, I would probably have given it 3-stars, and felt quite generous doing so. It was really \"meh\" and though I was a King fan, I wasn't pleased with it after the hype. I even delayed reading Book 2 for awhile because I was somewhat turned off. I didn't hate it, but it left me ambivalent for the most part.But this is definitely a book that gets better with time, with re-readings, and with the rest of the series. The second time I read it, I probably would have rated it 4-stars, and this was after reading Books 2 and 3 and preparing for the release of Book 4. By this time, I was in love with the series.I read it again just before Books 5-7 came out in fairly quick succession. And yes, by then it had earned the 5-star rating you see here. For this fourth read of The Gunslinger, I'm enchanted with it even more than before. On it's own, the book doesn't do much for me. But when you combine it with the entire series, wow! It's the essential beginning to the essential fantasy series of my generation. The Dark Tower is truly better than the sum of its parts.

There is joy and also pain but the rain in Spain falls on the plain. Time\u2019s a sheet, life\u2019s a stain, All the things we know will change and all those things remain the same, but be ye mad or only sane, the rain in Spain falls on the plain.We walk in love but fly in chains And the planes in Spain fall in the rain.\u201dI can not imagine Audrey Hepburn singing this version.The Gunslinger is Stephen King at his most whimsical and lyrical, not two words you would associate with him but his \u201cconstant readers\u201d know he is more versatile than he is given credit for. The first chapter of this book is stylistically atypical of King; he seems to be channeling Neil Gaiman, and the \u201cHigh Speech\u201d vernacular he invented for this series has a touch of Tolkien to it. The book\u2019s first line \u201cThe man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\u201d is King\u2019s \u201cIt was the best of time\u201d, an iconic quote for the author. There is nothing extraordinary about the sentence on its own, but the enormous epic tale that follows this one sentence is what makes it so memorable. The Gunslinger is the first book of King\u2019s magnum opus, a western flavored dark fantasy epic series that spans eight (mostly long) books, and over a decade in the making, The Dark Tower series. The Gunslinger s an unusually slim volume for King, clocking in at a mere 224 pages (the remainder of the series are all long books).The Gunslinger introduces Roland Deschain, the last of the gunslingers, a knightly order in a world that has \u201cmoved on\u201d, the population is sparse, food and water are scarce, technology is a lost art, much of the land is inhabitable; even reality seems to be losing cohesiveness as time flows unreliably and sun rises an sunsets can not be depended upon. Roland is on a mission to catch a sorcerer called the Man in Black (among other names), to gain knowledge about the Dark Tower, the nexus of the multiverse. The reason why he needs to be there is as yet unclear but it is of overriding importance and he will not let anything stand in his way, not even his own conscience.The Gunslinger vs the townsfolk of Tull!On his epic journey across Mid-World, after barely surviving being lynched by the entire townsfolk of Tull, Roland comes across Jake Chambers a young boy apparently from our world, Roland soon comes to love him, only to eventually betray him for the sake of his mission (not to worry, this is clearly telegraphed early on). What Roland learns about the Dark Tower will keep him and us constant readers busy for years.When I first read The Gunslinger in the 80s I was rather disappointed, the style was not what I expected from King who is always immediately accessible and generally without literary pretensions. The tone of this book did not seem King-like at all. This was the first King book I have read that is not set in contemporary America, the setting and language just did not click for me at the time. However, I was interested enough to read the follow up volume next volume  The Drawing of the Three and that blew me away, but the review of that is for another day. This reread is of the revised 2003 edition where King added some additional scenes and made minor alterations for the sake of consistency and general improvement. I have to say, I love this edition, this partly owed to King\u2019s revision, but also to my being a more mature than that first time. I am much more appreciative of the nuances the stylistic flair he puts into the text here. This time around I also enjoy the High Speech, the formal speech of the Gunslinger order, and the Low Speech (English with the odd twists) spoken by the general populace, tremendously. King has done his best world building with this series.My intention is to reread the first four books of the series, with the addition of the recently inserted  The Wind Through the Keyhole numbered as \u201cvolume 4.5\u201d. Certainly I am very much looking forward to reading  The Drawing of the Three, I have very fond memories of that book. As for this volume, The Gunslinger, it is much better than I remembered and stands alone quite well by itself. If you are a King fan you don't need to be convinced to read the Dark Tower series. If you are a fan of epic fantasy this series is one of the most unique and a must-read.Long days and pleasant nights, stranger.Notes:\u2022 According to King (in the forward of the book) the additional material is only 35 pages.\u2022 If you have read all the Dark Tower books and are looking for more \"Weird West\" (fantasy with Western aesthetics) check out David Gemmel\u2019s excellent Jon Shannow series. For more about this little subgenre with a list of recommended books have a look at this Wikipedia page.\u2022 Roger Zelazny\u2019s classic  The Chronicles of Amber series has a similar idea of a nexus world among the multiverse. There is a Western feel to some of it also.Quotes:\u201cGo then, there are other worlds than these.\u201d (another iconic quote)\u201cHe had laid his fuel in a pattern that was not artful but only workable. It spoke of blacks and whites. It spoke of a man who might straighten bad pictures in strange hotel rooms.\u201d\u201cEvery now and then a perverse downdraft would make the smoke whirl and puff toward him and he breathed some of it in. It built dreams in the same way that a small irritant may build a pearl in an oyster. The gunslinger occasionally moaned with the wind. The stars were as indifferent to this as they were to wars, crucifixions, resurrections.\u201d\u201cThen he puked, and it was black and full of blood. It went right through that grin like sewer water through a grate. The stink was enough to make you want to run mad. He raised up his arms and just threw over. That was all. He died in his own vomit with that grin on his face.\u201d\u201cHe put a shot into each of the crosspieces, blowing the roods to splinters, and four more into the woman\u2019s head. She seemed to accordion into herself and waver like a shimmer of heat.\u201dIdris Elba as The Gunslinger\u2022 The Worst Changes The Dark Tower Movie Made From the Books.Oh, dear, as a fan of the series it looks I am not going to like the 2017 movie adaptation, but at least somebody made this memo after watching it:Credit: \"chungame\" from Reddit."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52374080-mark", "userReview": "The first book of Stephen King's epic fantasy series will not disappoint but may frustrate - stick with me here.The Gunslinger is a rare book for fantasy lovers, it reads like a Clint Eastwood western - perhaps The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, Pale Rider or even Unforgiven. Our protagonist is indeed the Gunslinger, starting out on a mission that has plagued him from his childhood and his Father before him. A quest the he 'earns' the right to pursue, indeed he may well be the last Gunslinger alive.As the story evolves we learn of his enemy, the man in black, the one who he must hunt down and kill. A fairly straight forward quest, much like the aforementioned Eastwood movies. But as all fans of King know, there is nothing straight forward in the works of the master. His journey takes him across unforgiving lands where he meets another central character to the novel. For those of you that have read King's duet with Peter Straub, \"The Talisman\", in some ways this new character reflects the story line. The Talisman works with alternate universes and it is not exactly the same here yet we are introduced to a world that we all know but is obviously foreign to The Gunslinger - that is the world that we live in. There are several mentions of The Beatles song 'Hey Jude', subways and even the Statue of Liberty (Cue the planet of the apes). A perfect way to tie our world into the world of the Gunslinger without hammering home the point, some biblical references help too.There are many theories surrounding King's writing and his worlds. He himself has spoken in many books and interviews about them too but perhaps one of the most often asked questions involves the person who is Randall Flagg, he who appears in The Stand and The Talisman along with other books. Some go as far as to say he is the spiritual presence behind Pennywise in IT and the basis for the evil in Needful Things. To me, Flagg has never really been explained completely and I hope he isn't for a long time, if ever. The mystery and intrigue really draws the reader into King's universe and I, like most others, can only really believe what King says himself? Or can we? All theories aside the Gunslinger is the introduction to one of the greatest series ever written and a series which explains so many things in Stephen King's stand-alone books.At the start I said The Gunslinger may bring frustration. You start the read and so many questions arise almost immediately. Towards the end of the book most of these questions are answered for you while many, many more questions enter your mind. A brilliant work that will not allow the reader to stop at the first volume. I gave it four stars although I loved it. I just sense that one of the following volumes is going to blow me away and I need scope to judge it better.My last word on the Gunslinger, nineteen........."}, {"userName": "Mary ~Ravager of Tomes~", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1452829-mary-ravager-of-tomes", "userReview": "DNF @ 75%Attempt #2 with this went a little better than Attempt #1.

It's not that I think that kid was justified for only ever reading your books and no-one else's, and it's not that I thought you were a horrible writer and now I think you're amazing.But, this was really quite a pleasant surprise. I'm not sure what I expected. This was recommended by someone whose taste I trust, so I didn't expect it to be bad, but I don't know that I had anticipated that I would enjoy it quite so much as I did.Basically, Roland (\"the Gunslinger\") is chasing \"The Man in Black\" (which couldn't help but remind me of Johnny Cash, especially considering this whole Western theme) across a desert. In the process of this, he meets a lot of people (major characters include a woman with a scar on her face, a young boy and a guy with a house in the desert), shoots up an entire town, runs away from/kills mutants, talks about his history, and a few different worlds and languages that I still don't really entirely understand. It's all a little confusing and some things were cleared up and some things weren't. I forgive you the confusion, though, because I'm sure that's part of what's supposed to keep us pushing on to the next book in the series.Roland is an interesting enough character, though a somewhat typical hero type - complete loner, no more connections with anyone he loves (friends, family, romance), continuing on a quest because he's sworn out of some kind of duty and he's unrelenting, even at the sake of others' lives and his own, best on his own, etc. You've sent him through some compelling moral dilemmas and it's just the first book (HOLYSHIT THERE'S SEVEN), so I'm interested to see what you do with the rest of them. And your descriptions are one of the best things about the book - I can picture everything pretty clearly.Honestly, my biggest complaint is a small one: you use the word \"sardonic\" way too much! I swear, you use it more than I heard it in my 23 previous years - doubled, and I read some smart shit. You could've just said \"everything is sardonic,\" and it would've achieved the same point. I should've kept a running tally. There were also a couple others words that seemed out of place, like you were trying to say, \"I know my way around a dictionary, and here's proof! See, I'm fucking smart!\" Which I don't have a problem with if it feels natural, and I can't say that about some of your word choices.All in all, it's an adventure book, so I can't say I derived any huge themes from it, but also, hey, it's only the first book, and you've got the leisure of stretching your point over many of them, should you ultimately have one (which I would hope you do). It's off to a decent start, though, and I think there really is some good promise contained here, so I'll definitely be checking out the next book in the series.I liked it enough to not be embarrassed by the fact that I was reading one of your books, so that's a clear victory for you.

Why? I'm not really sure. Something to do with a Tower and the fact that \"the man in black\" is evil.\u00a0\nThe writing style is typical Stephen King - strange. In this book, he has the habit of starting a chapter with a sentence like: \"The boy found the oracle and it almost destroyed him.\" Then he'll go off on page after page of flashbacks or other none related storylines until at some point he'll come back around to the boy and the oracle. I guess it's meant to build suspense. I felt it slowed down the pacing of the plot.

I loved the main story and regretted any departures, but King generated enough interest in his main character to hold this reader's attention through some lengthy flashbacked backstory. King's writing still suffers here from his over usage of modifier short cuts. He occasionally will \"-ly\" himself out of a description of emotion or action, which would've taken a few minutes at most to rectify...although, who has time for such things when you're writing thousands upon thousands of pages at such an infamously breakneck speed that SNL fits it into a skit (http://www.hulu.com/watch/280366), and well, who am I to judge when your books are flying off store shelves at unheard of rates?I almost enjoyed the complete heck out of this to the point of a 5-stardom rating, but the showdown left me a little flat, as sometimes happens with books that are to-be-continued... ...oh but it shall be continued, oh yes, the reading will recommence!"}, {"userName": "Jeff ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12618229-jeff", "userReview": "[King is really going to lift T.H.

He is a haunting, solitary figure at first, on a mysterious quest through a desolate world that eerily mirrors our own. Pursuing the man in black, an evil being who can bring the dead back to life, Roland is a good man who seems to leave nothing but death in his wake.This new edition of The Gunslinger has been revised and expanded throughout by King, with new story material, in addition to a new introduction and foreword. It also includes four full-color illustrations in the hardcover and trade paperback formats.", "title": "The Gunslinger\n      \n          (The Dark Tower #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43615.The_Gunslinger", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1375776480l/43615.jpg", "reviews": 15367, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King", "name": "Stephen King"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Horror", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43615.The_Gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29430673-the-gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22550.The_Gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17944.The_Gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12090838-the-gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35478553-l-ultimo-cavaliere", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18003.The_Gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/995103.The_Gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20007633-the-gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32071039-the-gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36430308-the-gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28253070-the-gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9194932-the-gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30983478-the-gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11588.The_Shining", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149267.The_Stand", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10614.Misery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10592.Carrie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10644930-11-22-63", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
