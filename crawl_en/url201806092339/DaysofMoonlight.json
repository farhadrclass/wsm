She uncovers Mehtap\u2019s story as a factory worker in the 1960s who is infatuated with her boss, a man she willingly lies for, and even wraps the presents that he gives to his wife and his mistress. When her friend Nuray moves in with her, something unexpected happens and Mehtap is forced to choose between her two loves. Mehtap\u2019s story is interwoven with that of her parents, Cretan refugees who landed in Izmir in the mid-twenties as a result of the disastrous population exchange, only to discover an inescapable and tragic truth that shatters their lives. As Mehtap\u2019s writings unfurl, Nuray\u2019s daughter \u2014 Mehtap\u2019s namesake \u2014 now the keeper of the journals, notebooks and letters written by her mother\u2019s friend, also uncovers her own mother\u2019s deeply-held secrets, furtive yearnings, and forbidden love.", "title": "Days of Moonlight", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37544989-days-of-moonlight", "average": 5.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1513375104l/37544989.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5381463.Loren_Edizel", "name": "Loren Edizel"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5381463.Loren_Edizel", "name": "Loren Edizel"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37544989-days-of-moonlight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17865161-the-ghosts-of-smyrna", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13209214-adrift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22225745-confessions"]}
