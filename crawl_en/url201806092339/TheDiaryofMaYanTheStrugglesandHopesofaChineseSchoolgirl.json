Ma Yan's diary is a testament to this: given the most basic education in a school without even a library, she dreams of an \"ideal\" job in her future that will release her parents from grinding poverty and back-breaking labour. The Communist training shows through in her constant self-criticism, making her believe she is slow and stupid, only to find later that she is actually top in all her classes. Students and teachers still call each other \"comrade\" and there is a state directive to prepare the land to plant trees, which Yan dreams will \"soon make the landscape green\"--no one seems to notice that the countryside round about is so arid that it probably won't support intensive tree planting, given that the people have to gather snow and rain in underground cisterns for water.In the US there has long been a joke-meme about someone's grandfather \"walking 10 miles uphill both ways to school, through the snow up to here...\" In Ma Yan's world, this is reality. She does indeed walk many miles to the boarding school each week through the mountain roads clad in her only set of school clothes and light canvas shoes--and it's no joke. She does without extra food for two weeks to afford the ballpoint pen she treasures. Kids have to provide their own school supplies, and take sacks of rice to school to provide for their one meal a day, which in Yan's case is only the rice--when she can get it. Often, she is told \"there's no rice left.\" Just like that. When the steamed bread she brings from home each week runs out, she's out of luck. She worries about her eyesight and hearing in class--in reality these are the symptoms of starvation. And she castigates herself for not studying harder, so she can be worthy of the bread she brings from home.Fortunately the publication of her diary (parts of which were used by her illiterate father for cigarrette paper as he didn't know and probably didn't care what it was) brought the attention of many in France to the plight of children in her area of China. This opened a door to one-on-one aid, and many have been able to study thanks to her honest appraisal of her situation."}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1009267-meg", "userReview": "This is one of those cases where the story is AMAZING, the book itself is decent. Ma Yan's STORY is inspiring, heartbreaking, and in many ways unbelievable to us pampered ones. We just can't fathom surviving on a single bowl of rice a day, owning only one change of clothes, spending months at a time without parents while they travel far away in search of work, suffering merciless beatings at the hands of teachers, walking five hours to school (in the snow, of course), living in a one-room house in China's \"Region of Thirst\" where the average annual income is $48, crying everyday out of sheer HUNGER, seeing children sold for a few pounds of rice (or married off at 13)... The story is BEYOND important--even VITAL. In fact, since the publication of the book, hundreds of school children in Ma Yan's region have completed their education due to donations from conscientious readers. (Yes--even many of those \"worthless\" girls!)The greatest benefit of reading this book? The next time your preteen complains about the hardships of life, instead of just uttering some ubiquitous, meaningless, people-are-starving-in-Africa type argument... you can just hand them this book and say, \"Read up, sweetheart.\"FAVORITE QUOTES:Today I am very sad. Do you want to know why? Because this morning my parents told me that when I got home, I had to feed the ox. I refused. But when I got home, I did feed the ox. The work has left my hands all rough and swollen. They\u2019re horrible to look at. And so I\u2019m led to reflect: I\u2019ve fed the ox once, and my hands are already rough. Mother feeds him every day\u2014which explains why her hands are so swollen. Everything she does is for my brothers\u2019 and my future. I want to cry and can\u2019t say a word. Please come back, Mother and Father. I need your love! I was wrong, okay? Come back quick. I\u2019m thinking of you. Please come back. (70-71)Why are we alive? The rich die after having known all kinds of pleasures. The poor live with tears in their eyes. When they die, their death is painful. And that\u2019s the truth of it.

Also, this book looks so attracting to me that I want to read it. I think this book will let me write a good review and use the time precisely without wasting the time and it will let me finish the book as soon as possible.This book will fit the category of \u201cA diary, autobiography or biography\u201d because this book is a diary book. This book will tell us what is happening in their lifetime as they are living in their poor country, what they do, what they will do in the future to lend a better life for them.My favourite character of this book is Ma Yan because she tries her best to appreciate her parents as they lived in the poor village called Zhangjiashu which it is about thousands of kilometres north-west from Beijing in China. Ma Yan really wanted to work hard to get great results for her brother and her family. Sometimes, she fails to appreciate her parents in the exam so she end up got into a big trouble and her mother was angry at her. Her school life is terrible than our school life as we have it now. Her life is terrible, for example: if you do something naughty in the classroom or talking while the teacher is taking, you will get a punishment immediately by hitting with the belt. The child will end up with bruise on their body. They have test regularly every 2-3 weeks to see if you can pass it. Sometimes, Ma Yan got the bad test results and sometimes her test results is good. Some people in my Form Class might have the same balance as Ma Yan. My favourite quote from this book is \u201cIf we give a net to a fisherman, he can catch fish!\u201d\u2014Ma Yan. What is special about is quote is if you stay in the boat waiting for the fish, you won\u2019t succeed in everything, if you delay learning all the time and not revising, also you are wasting the time like I sometimes do. If you catch a fish, you used the time efficiently to study hard, trying to get a good grade and you will succeed in the future to get into a good high school. Ma Yan want to succeed in the future at her school, also Ma Yan wants to help her parents as they are ill and hardworking.I learned from this book is you have to succeed to get a better job to make good money to lead a better life for yourself and your parents. The most important in your life is your parent because without your parents you can\u2019t success in the future, you unable to get some support as possible to keep it going. Not just your parent, you family as well.I would recommend to somebody who have some English problem because there has been a good simile and metaphors used in this book like \u201cHer tummy is burning\u201d \u2026 There are some other techniques I didn\u2019t recognise because they are a brand new techniques to me. You should read it to find out some techniques. This is book is excellent story, sad and happiness with a good description."}, {"userName": "Krista the Krazy Kataloguer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/316102-krista-the-krazy-kataloguer", "userReview": "Every teacher should read this and share it with their students!

Through her true diary entries she reveals her dreams of making it through her education and getting a good career to get her family out of poverty. You can\u2019t help but love and root for this girl! She has such determination, she\u2019s constantly saying how she must continue to work harder and harder in her studies. She\u2019s not the best in her class, but she has SUCH a strong work ethic.Ma Yan is so selfless, she wants more than anything to ease the suffering of her poverty-stricken family. She talks about her family with such love and devotion, which is something you don\u2019t really hear from teenagers in America.Pros: Ma Yan is a very likeable person with a very inspiring story. She writes well and you can vividly imagine the world she lives in. She describes what hunger and cold feel like so well that it feels like you\u2019re there. There are also breaks between some diary entries where the editors teach you about the part of China she lives in, her culture, and how the school system works there which were very interesting.Cons: Her entries are very repetitive. She writes mostly about what she did in school, about how she wishes to get her family out of poverty, and that she must continue to work harder. This is all good content, but it\u2019s literally almost every single entry.In the end I gave it 4/5 stars, simply because I admire Ma Yan so much and her story is so inspiring."}, {"userName": "Rana Ansari", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31859720-rana-ansari", "userReview": "While fiction is fabricated from beginning to end, and nonfiction is generally sensationalized, this is the raw and unedited diary of a thirteen year old Chinese girl revealing her constant struggle to get an education despite the minimal resources, harsh conditions, and grinding poverty.

Pierre Haski, the man who originally translated and published Ma Yan\u2019s diaries in a newspaper, was really just there to take some photos of backwater China, which in 2002 had barely changed in hundreds of years. Ma Yan\u2019s mother was the one who actually gave him the diaries, and he said when he read them, he knew he had to do something to help the teenager achieve her dreams.The diaries cover only a few months of two different years of Ma Yan\u2019s life, but they\u2019re more enough to give readers a glimpse of the harsh realities of life for Ma Yan and her family. Her parents are often gone, working in places like Inner Mongolia or in fields hundreds of miles away to make enough money to buy new clothes, some food, and pay school fees for the children. The schools that Ma Yan and her brothers attend are often so far away that they live in dormitories during the week, only returning home on the weekends. They walk many miles home on Friday, only occasionally able to afford the 1-yuan (15-cent) fare tractor drivers charge for a ride. Even when they do have the money for it, she and her brothers often walk home anyway, just to save it for when they genuinely need it.Full review at A Writer Reads."}, {"userName":

This book follows her life as she fights for her education, faces hunger, and strives to be the best of her class so she can get a good job and pull her family out of poverty. This diary hits on the theme that people from different backgrounds have to face different issues. I believe this is the main theme that I found from this book because it taught me about the hardships that real people face. I would recommend this book to anyone that would like to learn about people the same age as us in completely different social, emotional, and economic situations than us."}, {"userName": "Andy Raptis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17235782-andy-raptis", "userReview": "Nothing really great in literary terms, but what do you expect from a thirteen year old girl? There are also some annoying inserts by the French editor which interrupt the flow of the main story.There is also a very good film adaption which didn't do well in terms of distribution. It seems that the makers of the film forgot to secure the copyrights that's why the plot is much different from that of the book. As a matter of fact its a much more accomplished work than the published diary. Definitely worth checking out.

Later blijkt dat de 13-jarige Ma Yan de schrijfster hiervan is. Via haar dagboekaantekeningen komen we meer te weten over haar leven op het Chinese platteland en hoe moeilijk dit vaak is. De burgers van het platteland zijn een beetje de vergeten groep. De woon- en werkomstandigheden zijn slecht, net als het onderwijs en de gezondheidszorg. Ook is er veel armoede en honger. Ma Yan vertelt ons hoe dit hoe dit allemaal voor haar is. Ze vertelt ook met name hoe lastig ze het vindt dat naar school gaan niet iets vanzelfsprekends is, met name niet voor meisjes, terwijl Ma Yan niets liever wilt dan naar school gaan.Soms vergeet ik wel eens hoe goed ik het eigenlijk heb en dat ik weinig te klagen heb. Dit boek heeft me daar weer even aan herinnerd. Het boek herinnerde me er ook aan hoe oneerlijk de wereld eigenlijk is...'\"Ik wil leren,\" schreef Ma Yan boven aan haar brief (...) Om de ballpoint die ze heeft gebruikt te kunnen kopen, zo lezen we later in haar dagboek, heeft ze twee weken lang bijna niets gegeten.'Ma Yan heeft het niet gemakkelijk, maar legt zich er gelukkig niet bij neer. Ze werkt- samen met haar ouders - heel hard om te kunnen doen wat ze het liefste wilt: naar school gaan om te leren. Ik bewonderde Ma Yan enorm om haar wilskracht en vind eigenlijk dat iedere scholier dit boek zou moeten lezen. Niet alleen wordt het belang van onderwijs duidelijk (en hoe dankbaar we mogen zijn dat wij allemaal naar school mogen/moeten), maar ook leer je een hele hoop over hoe het er aan toe gaat aan de andere kant van de wereld. Je leert niet enkel over de problemen die zich daar afspelen, maar ook over de gebruiken en gewoonten. Het dagboek zelf is niet altijd even pakkend, maar de stukken aanvullende informatie en foto's tussendoor zijn zeer interessant en geven een levendig beeld van het leven op het Chinese platteland."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6307134-elizabeth", "userReview": "The Diary of Ma Yan, by Ma Yan and Pierre Haski, is the story of a teenage girl living in a remote area of China. Her diaries were given to a French journalist as he traveled through her remote village in northern China. In her journal, which was translated from its original Mandarin, into French, and later English, Yan tells of her quest for an education. Her Muslim family is desperately poor and raising the funds to attend school requires extreme sacrifice for her parents. If Ma Yan quits school, then there is another set of hands to farm or work to raise money for the family. Yan also has two younger brothers that also need education. Yan\u2019s mother has medical issues that go untreated, because there is no money for a doctor. Often Ma Yan and her family go with only 1 small meal of rice a day and frequently go with nothing. The school that the children attend is 12 miles away. So every week, they walk the distance to school and stay for the week. The conditions at the school are no better than at home. The teachers are strict, there is little food, and while all the children are poor, Ma Yan has less than most. Through it all, Ma Yan is determined to honor the sacrifice her parents have made, by continuing her education. The story, while moving and inspirational, was a bit dull. It also tends to be repetitive. This is because it is the diary of a thirteen year old, and most of her days are repetitive. If I wanted to have students read a diary, I would recommend Diary of Anne Frank. While the end of this story is not yet written, and there is hope that Ma Yan will have the better life she seeks, I don\u2019t think that this book will keep the attention of the average student. These would certainly be its weaknesses. The strengths of this story is the voice of Ma Yan. Her diary entries, comments about classmates and teachers, her criticism of family members are believable. While the reader may not understand everything about the culture, her feelings are understandable. It is disappointing that more isn\u2019t said about her Muslim faith. That would have added more to the very strong cultural aspects of this book. Additionally, there is a very strong bond within the family. Ma Yan\u2019s love for them and her consciousness of what her parents are sacrificing for her are very strong.  If I were using this in the classroom, I would certainly use this for journal writing activities. Do I take my education as seriously as Ma Yan? If I had to walk 12 miles each way to school would I? Additionally, older students could compare Ma Yan to Junior from Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian. How does their search for a better education affect their family? This would also be an interesting story to read before a class service project, such as spending a day at the food pantry, Feed My Starving Children, or doing a school supply drive. It certainly gives most students a window into real poverty.Recommended by Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center, UW-Madison"}, {"userName": "Jonathan H", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23890746-jonathan-h", "userReview": "I believe Ma Yan\u2019s message in The Diary of Ma Yan is that education and a hard ethic work is the only way out of poverty and starvation. This novel takes place in the rural area of Ningxia China during the early 2000s. Ningxia is home to the Hui people, a minority in China. The Hui people are Chinese-Muslim opposed to the other religions in China. The Diary of Ma Yan is told through the eyes of the ambitious young schoolgirl, Ma Yan. Ma Yan\u2019s family is extremely poor and don\u2019t have regular meals. Her mother who has a life threatening disease, goes off pick fa cai to earn enough money to send Ma Yan and her two younger brothers to school. Her father meanwhile is doing labor is distant lands to also earn money for Ma Yan and her brothers. Ma Yan knows that her parents are starving themselves, and her mother is working risking her life with an illness that could kill her, in order to give them the chance of education that they never had. Ma Yan tries her hardest in school and overcomes hungry, frustration, and hopelessness. Ma Yan climbs her way to the top of the class to prove to her parents that they are not doing all this hard work for nothing. Ma Yan faces many other challenges. She must walk miles to school and protect herself on the way from robbers. She endures long periods without food to save enough money for just a pen so that she could write her diary.\tThis novel, written from Ma Yan\u2019s Diary was truly a touching journey. One of the parts of the book I enjoyed the most was the character, Ma Yan\u2019s mother. It describes her as a devoted mother who, despite her stomach illness will go to hard work in order to send her daughter and sons to school. Ma Yan\u2019s mother is such an amazing admirable strong character. She will do anything to give her kids the life she never had. She suffers in order to give her kids a better future. She is one of my favorite characters in any book I have read. She is truly a mother to admire. This book kind of reminds me of the book A Long Walk To Water by Lind Sue Park, a book about the struggles of a girl in Africa. Even though this book reminds me of Ma Yan\u2019s Diary there is not comparison between the two books. Ma Yan\u2019s Diary was different, and I liked it more. This book also reminds me of the value of education to my family and many other families across the globe. The strengths of this book are definitely the characters. The story was also very interesting and never kept you bored. This book will get emotions out of you. The only weakness is that unfortunately party of the dairy were missing, because Ma Yan\u2019s father used the paper to roll cigars. So in the novel there are some sections that are missing and then it resumes later. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone, especially if they liked learning about life in other countries."}, {"userName": "Dewiyani", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4957338-dewiyani", "userReview": "Buku ini ditransformasikan dari buku harian seorang gadis kecil bernama Ma Yan. Sayang ada bagian yg hilang dari buku harian tersebut karena telah berubah menjadi asap. Yeah\u2026 menjadi asap karena Ma Dongji, ayah Ma Yan, mempunyai kebiasaan membuat rokok lintingan dari buku-buku anaknya yg sudah tidak terpakai.Ma Yan tinggal di desa terpencil di negri Cina. Setiap minggu Ma Yan dan saudara laki-lakinya harus menempuh jarak sejauh 7 mil dengan berjalan kaki menuju sekolah mereka dimana mereka tinggal dan bersekolah sepanjang minggu. Tidak terbayangkan betapa beratnya perjalanan mereka. Gelap\u2026 dingin\u2026 ditambah berandalan yg sering mencegat di tengah jalan dan merampas apa saja yg mereka bawa.Saking miskinnya, acapkali Ma Yan hanya makan semangkuk nasi sehari, tanpa lauk ataupun sayur. Kadang-kadang ayah atau ibu Ma Yan memberikan sedikit uang lebih yg bisa dipergunakan untuk membeli sayuran di pasar atau untuk menumpang traktor pulang ke rumah pada akhir minggu. Tapi Ma Yan lebih memilih untuk tidak makan siang supaya bisa membeli sebatang pulpen.Ma Yan termasuk anak yg pintar, tetapi ia tidak akan puas bila tidak memperoleh rangking pertama di kelasnya. Ibu Ma Yan pun tidak segan-segan mencaci Ma Yan dan membuatnya merasa bersalah, seakan-akan Ma Yan telah mensia-siakan keja keras ayah dan ibunya.Saya jadi miris membacanya\u2026 karena seorang ibu seharusnya lemah lembut dan halus tutur katanya. Intinya bisa menentramkan jiwa sang anak. Tapi hal itu tidak saya tangkap dari sosok Bai Juhua, ibu Mayan. Mungkin kemiskinan dan kerasnya hidup telah mengikis habis kelembutan itu.Meskipun demikian Bai Juhua memahami betul keinginan Ma Yan untuk terus bersekolah. Ia rela bekerja keras membanting tulang, menggarap ladang milik mereka sendiri yg tidak seberapa luas, memanen tanaman orang lain atau pergi bermil-mil jauhnya untuk memanen rumput fa cai, dengan harapan anak-anakanya bisa terus bersekolah dan memiliki kehidupan yg lebih baik darinya.Ma Yan-pun sangat mencintai ibunya, meskipun kadang-kadang suka bersikap kasar. Hal ini terlihat jelas dari tulisan Ma Yan pada buku hariannya yg berisi ungkapan perasaannya yg campur aduk, silih berganti antara rasa cinta yg dalam, hormat dan perasaan marah atas ketidakadilan yg diterimanya.Spontanitas Bai Juhua saat menyodorkan buku harian Ma Yan kepada Pierre Haski telah merubah segalanya."}, {"userName": "Amber Garabrandt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5908784-amber-garabrandt", "userReview": "*Minor spoiler alert* I honestly can\u2019t say what made me pick up The Diary or Ma Yan, but I am so glad I did. It really illuminates the differences in culture; what we take for granted here in America is what they dream of. An education, in her small village in China (Zhangjuashu), can very much be the difference between starvation and hope for a happy life. Coming from a peasant upbringing, she sees her parents and grandparents working constantly, back breaking work in the fields. Throughout the diary is her beautiful and sincere wish to succeed in her studies and become someone who can support her family and give them an easier life- a happy life. \tShe speaks of the hardships of getting to school, her middle school being miles from home. Being a boarder, they have to pay for all food, bringing in rice from the family. There are many times when all she had was rice because she could not afford the vegetables that could be bought to go along side it, and had run out of bread her mother made for the week. There is also talk of the hardships she had to go through to afford her school books and something as simple as a pen. It tears at my heart to think that there are areas where these are concerns, yet this is not the only story like this. She often talks about her Mother in glowing, respectful terms; about how hard she works and worries over her illness. \tIn 2002 a French newspaper, Liberation, printed an exert of her diary. She touched so many with her words, that many began talking of financing her schooling. Thus, the Association for the Children of Ningxia was founded to help children of families in need continue their schooling. Hundreds of students have been helped by this charity.This book is out now, go get it!On the adult content scale, there is nothing.

I can see how this would be very powerful for people who have not been exposed to it, but sadly, I have been. I am very familiar with the give and take of the Chinese parents and students, and how much pressure the students put of themselves to be the best. I am very familiar with telling my former students that I'm so proud of how much they have been learning, that the grade doesn't matter, and being informed that in this world, the grade is ALL that matters.I had at least two students in each of my classes that had been ripped from their families after being told that they were the best and the brightest from the region - and that they should go forth and be the beacon for their hometown. The trick of the situation for MY students was that they were learning their third language and were years behind their peers. I can not even express how frustrating this system is; how you feel like you are leaving students behind who want nothing more than to learn; how badly you feel when all the other students get to go home for breaks or weekends, but they, they not only don't have the money to go home, the government restricts WHEN they can go home - four times in eight years. Then, when they graduate, they are told that they can't come back to the mainland. How does that make sense? Look! You've worked your butt off and made major sacrifices for the last eight years. This is all you CAN'T have. Thanks for playing.Perhaps I would have been more moved by Ma Yan's story if I didn't personally know people that are much worse off than Ma Yan. That being said...

Several times she was concerned she wouldn't be able to ever go to school again, several times she's starving of hunger, and her mother is sick. The book is really cool and it's really neat how it teaches you a lot about China.WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK: I liked that it was real and how it taught me about China, mostly Chinese currency. The publishers also stopped the diary every once in a while to explain somethings about China and Ma Yan's life and culture.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE BOOK: Some things were kind of confusing and the book got very boring sometimes, since it was just a diary. Some days of your life are boring and some are interesting.MY FAVORITE PERSON IN THE BOOK: Ma Yan of course.MY LEAST FAVORITE PERSON IN THE BOOK: I don't know. I didn't not like any of them. Maybe one of her teachers that was mean? I don't really know.MY FAVORITE SCENE IN THE BOOK: I'm not really sure. I liked a lot of scenes.MY LEAST FAVORITE SCENE: When she was so hungry and didn't have any fen or yuan (money in China) to buy any food. That was so sad.WHAT AGE I WOULD RECCOMEND THE BOOK FOR: Probably nine and up, maybe ten. There isn't anything bad in the book that I can recall, except one of her teachers is kind of mean and hits the students. Also it might be hard for some kids reading it to know how hungry she was, she was literally starving.RATING OUT OF FIVE: Four stars.
