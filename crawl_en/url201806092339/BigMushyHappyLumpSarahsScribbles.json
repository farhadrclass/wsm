I also found Big Mushy Happy Lump a lot more enjoyable and relatable than Andersen's previous collection, so that left me with an ever bigger smile plastered on my face.Sarah Andersen's second collection picks up right where the first left off\u2013huddled under a pile of blankets avoiding the responsibilities of the real world. These new comics (and illustrated personal essays!) follow the ups and downs of the unrelenting self-esteem roller coaster that is young adult life: budgeting woes, cramps, the nuances of sweather theft, and the joy of staying home all day with a box of pizza. All aboard.So without further ado, here are some of my favorite pieces:\n\n\nI hate how relatable the above one is\u2026.\nI laughed out loud at \u201cpunch the sun.\u201d\n\nReminded me of the song Take a Hint from the show Victorious.\nThis genuinely happened to me today!!

It was, of course, SUPER RELATABLE for anxious introverts. Although I didn't think it was quite as relatable as the first one. For starters: I don't like cats (#allergic) and I don't steal the larger comfy sweaters of humans in my life (I don't have larger humans in my life and I don't like touching other people's clothes...no thank you). BUT!! There were comics on forgetting everything but remembering excruciatingly painful things...spending tons of money on books but being a scrooge elsewhere...avoiding humans....trying to talk to a human but instead being just an awkward cabbage...and watching your motivation bust a hole in the wall and run away from you forever.Dude, #relatable.The whole comic didn't quite tie together as nicely as the first though, hence just the 3 stars.But it was still so fun!!

Luckily, it was just as cute as the first one and just as enjoyable. If you enjoy those cute, relatable comics that everyone seems to enjoy sharing on social media - you MUST check this out. Every one of these had me giggling and appreciating Sarah Andersen's humor. Not to mention, the artwork is so well done in it's simplicity and there's really something for everyone to enjoy. I mentioned in my review of her first collection that these comics seemed unrelated to one another and that there wasn't a cohesive story told. In this one, that's mostly still the case with the exception of a few towards the end where a few of them are grouped with an additional text to tell a short story that reads like it's a personal account from the author. Even in this different formatting, the comics are relevant and enjoyable. What did I think?: I enjoyed this collection of comics just as much as the first, and as a new Sarah Andersen fan I am excited about seeing more of what she creates and shares with her audience in the future. Who should read it?: If you've enjoyed other work by Sarah Andersen or are looking for a fun, easy read then I highly recommend you check this out. I read this in one sitting and then flipped back through several times and shared my favorites with friends - there's something for everyone and this is one I can see picking back up on occasion for years to come.

Again I am amazed how she has created humor out of real life situations. Adulthood is a Myth was also a relatable and humorous read. And so was this one. Another thing I liked about this comic is that, this time Sarah wrote personal essays on 'mostly she doesn't like popular things' and 'how she came to love cats' and 'her being a sweater theif'. Last one was uniquely weird. But I liked that too. :pAll in all, I highly recommend both, this one and Adulthood is a Myth.

Para mi ese aspecto le da un poco m\u00e1s de inter\u00e9s a los dibujos, que por dem\u00e1s siempre han sido autobiogr\u00e1ficos. No puedo decir que es la mejor tira c\u00f3mica que he le\u00eddo (Mafalda sigue y seguir\u00e1 teniendo ese trono) pero se mantiene entretenido, no obstante siento que deber\u00edan espaciar las salidas de estos libros, no tanto del web c\u00f3mic, para no morir de \u00e9xito, dado que se nota la reiteraci\u00f3n de varias ideas y chistes, lograr la \"formula simpson\" (repetir un chiste una y otra y otra y otra vez hasta que te canse y repetirlo nuevamente hasta que vuelva a gustarte) es bastante complicado especialmente en espacio tan limitado por lo que lo mejor ser\u00eda no sobreexplotar a este simp\u00e1tico personaje.A digital copy of this book was provided by NetGalley______________________________________When I read  Adulthood Is a Myth I had never seen anything created by Sarah Andersen, that was my first approach to her work and I can say that I liked it a lot and continued, from time to time, following the post that she puts at Facebook, is why for this book many of the strips were no longer new or fascinating, in fact as I knew a little more Andersen's work many of them ended up been kind of disappointed, however there is an aspect that makes me put this but at the same level as the previous one and is the author's narration about how these strips have helped to grow and improve as a person, beyond the fame or the recognition that they have brought her. For me that aspect gives a little more interest to the drawings, which have always been autobiographical.I cannot say that it is the best comic strip I have ever read (Mafalda continues and will continue having that throne) but remains entertained, however I feel that they should space the releases of these books, not need it for the comic web, to avoid die of success, since you can see the repetition of several ideas and jokes, achieve the \"simpson's formula \" (repeating a joke over and over and over and over again until you get tired of it and repeat it again until you like again) Is quite complicated especially in space so limited so it would be best not to overexploit this nice character.A digital copy of this book was provided by NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Montzalee Wittmann", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32532051-montzalee-wittmann", "userReview": "A book to bring a smile to my heartSarah knows how to make her art express the everyday life trials in a funny way yet with truth!

Andersen\u2019s strips are humorous and self-deprecating snapshots focusing on her insecurities, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, social awkwardness, period pains, and general self-loathing (procrastination) couched within drawings of cute big-eyed/small-bodied figures. That might sound a bit too neurotic but Andersen turns her public therapy into really funny strips. I laughed at the feline Paris Hilton (that vapid face was dead on!) and Sarah\u2019s expression at seeing a puppy in a sweater, and her observations on tattoos and the differences between men/women\u2019s fashion were insightful and clever. She\u2019s doing something different from her first book in the second half of this book by branching out into longer-form narratives. Included are stories on learning to overthink less, the Saga of Sadie (a cute kitty who helped solve her mouse problem and showed her why people love cats), and The Sweater Thief, which was adorable. I can see her maybe moving away from strips soon and building up to a book length-narrative - these encouraging longer pieces definitely show she\u2019s got the storytelling rhythm down. Andersen\u2019s strips are charming and easily accessible and, like many other readers I expect, I identified with her anti-social tendencies to be alone, watching Netflix or reading, over mingling with real people in the real world - blech! Combine that with self-awareness, imagination, comedic timing and wit and it\u2019s not hard to see why people respond to her books. Not all the strips are home-runs and a few feel like retreads of similar strips from the first book, but Big Mushy Happy Lump is still a very enjoyable, fun read - fans of Sarah\u2019s Scribbles will love this!"}, {"userName": "Korrina  (OwlCrate)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37437502-korrina-owlcrate", "userReview": "I love Sarah's comics so much and have read them for ages.
