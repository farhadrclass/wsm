A multigenerational family saga beginning in Martinique up through present-day Canada? I was all in! Abeje and Adunbi, sister and brother, open the story living and working as slaves on a Caribbean sugar plantation. Later on, after emancipation, Adunbi\u2019s daughter, Hetty, finds her way to Quebec City and lives free. What follows is a family saga with multiple layers of narrative of Rougeaux family successes and injustices experienced. I absolutely adored the easy flowing writing style, the beautifully drawn settings, the well-developed characters, the messages in the writing, and the ambition it took to undertake such a layered story. For the first half of the book, it was challenging for me to keep the family members straight, and I referenced the family tree frequently. Eventually, I began to feel the voice of \u201cthe family,\u201d and I was not as concerned about exactly who was speaking. I had to relax into the writing. I also found the timeline to be challenging to follow at times because, even as a fervent historical fiction fan who happens to love multiple timelines, this one jumped around. Overall, I was drawn deeply into the Rougeaux family\u2019s story and its rich characters, and I found it to be a story of hope and healing across generations. I look forward to reading the sequel to this book! Thank you to Jenny Jaeckel, Raincloud Press, and Netgalley for the ARC. House of Rougeaux is available now!

In this novel, I followed this family from their roots as slaves from the island of Martinique in 1785, to Philadelphia in the 1940\u2019s and 1960\u2019s to Montreal in the 1880\u2019s and 1920\u2019s and also New York City. The part of the book that I liked the best was the first quarter of it, introducing us to Abeji and her brother Adundi and their mother Iya. Healing, spirits, seeing - the magical realism seems to fit the time and place in on Martinique 1785-1860. I found the writing in the early time period to be lyrical, more descriptive and the tone more atmospheric than the rest of the novel. I was captivated and couldn\u2019t wait to find out the fate of family moving forward in time. I enjoyed meeting Nelie in 1949 and Rosalie in 1964 in Philadelphia, Martine and Hetty and Guillaume in 1925 , 1853 and 1883 Montreal. Their stories of how racism impacted them and the things in life that happen - pregnancy out of marriage and homosexuality in times when they were so unacceptable, race riots, draft evasion, death - were moving. The narratives moved around over the years, across a century but not in chronological order. The family tree at the beginning was helpful, but keeping track of all of the characters and how they were related was difficult at times. This format didn\u2019t quite work for me and that\u2019s why I can\u2019t give it a solid four stars. I could manage two maybe three time frames narrated out of order but seven felt like too many to me. It distracted me and the story lost momentum for me. I have to round it up to four stars, though, because the writing was lovely and the characters appealing. The incorporation of the magical realism was also easily accepted in the context of the story.

It starts with a brother and sister, slaves on a sugar plantation in Martinique, in the early 19th century. Abeje, the girl, utilizes her natural gifts and those of the natural world to become a healer. Her brother's daughter makes her way to Canada, eventually winning her freedom, and becomes the head of a family whose members make their way through life and through various cities in North America. We get an intimate picture of slave life on a Caribbean island, the life of a freed slave in Canada, and many other touching portraits of the lives of this unique family. There is heartache, joy, births and deaths, triumphs and tragedies. There are obvious difficulties that the slaves face, and there are lesser ones faced by the historical realities of a post-slavery world and societies that still struggle with prejudice and bigotry. But we also feel the joys of the family relations and the touching moments. It is a great read in historical fiction.The time periods cover many decades, and the narrative shifts to several times over 2 centuries. One writing choice that I think was less than helpful was the author's jumping between time periods in a non-chronological way. We go from 1830s, to 1949, then 1964, 1925, 1853, back to 1883, etc. There was really no narrative or dramatic purpose for shuffling these timelines in this way, and indeed it would have only helped the narrative to put the periods in chronological order, as the drama of the family as it makes its way through history and into the future would be more touching and dramatic, and it would provide a greater sense of continuity from the past and their slave beginnings. It also made it a little confusing for the reader, who has to keep referring to the family tree in the beginning of the book to keep the family relations straight. The author is very skilled at inhabiting the various characters she focuses on in each part. Each of them is a distinct voice whose personalities come through strongly. Rather than feel disjointed at a new character's narrative, the various stories speak to the reader as part of a larger familial whole. Thus the family saga feels like one continuous tale, from Ayo's beginning as the familial matriarch, down to the near-present-day story lines. There are a number of typos in this review copy I was given, and the author or publisher may contact me about them if they so desire.Thank you to the author and publishers for a review copy."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45330129-jennifer", "userReview": "I won this novel from a Goodreads giveaway. This is my honest review. First things first, this novel was incredibly well written. From the very start, the narrative draws you in and the words flow smoothly. I love it when a book is able to easily and quickly engage you, and this book definitely does that. The book centers on a black slave family and the joys and struggles they face throughout multiple generations. It begins with two children who are slaves on a sugar plantation and follows them and their descendants throughout their lives. Each Character is well developed and you're soon invested in their personal stories. At times the book is sad and heartbreaking and at other times inspiring and triumphant.

The House of Rougeaux is a wonderful multi-generational family epic, following a family from slavery in Martinique to freedom and a multitude of stories and lives in Canada and the northeastern US. Multigenerational family stories are a particular love of mine, and I especially enjoyed getting to know parts of history that were unfamiliar to me. I liked the author's technique of skipping forward and back in time in order to flesh out the stories of each generation. I still want to know what happens with Rosalie (my favorite character). I hope the author writes a sequel that includes her!The one aspect of the book that I did not care much for was the focus on spiritual healing, psychics, communicating with animals, etc. Since I don't believe in any of that it just seemed silly to me.

This story starts in the Carribean and stretches to Canada. The author tells by jumping around in time. For the first half of the book, I had trouble keeping the characters straight because my eyesight is too poor to read the family tree. If the print size on the family tree could be increased, that would help tremendously. After the first half of the book, I was able to connect the different members of the family together and the stories had more meaning. Racial discrimination, homosexuality,family ties and slavery were all evident in this historical fiction tale of generations. I loved learning about the funeral customs of the Carribean, the way that the author handled the homosexuality in this book. The characters, Guillaume Rougeaux and Eleanor Rougeaux were described with beautiful sensitivity to their challenges.I would love to read the sequel to this book.I received an Advance Reading Copy of this book as a win from LibraryThing from the publishers in exchange for a fair book review.

Not great, not a page turner that kept me up all night, but it was good. I was intrigued by the description of the story on the back - a brother and sister, Adunbi and Abeje, are born into slavery on a sugar plantation on the Antilles Island of Martinique and they survive, despite brutality, death, illness and loss. The beginning of the book follows their lives for a bit, then subsequent chapters are about the lives of some of their descendants. There is a family tree in the beginning which I found myself referring to constantly, just to keep track of everyone. I tend to get impatient and irritated with books that have too many characters to remember. The book was like a collection of individual different stories, out of chronological order, so it did seem disjointed in parts. I liked the descriptions of nature and some of the characters were well drawn out, while others weren't and many weren't even mentioned again. Which left me wondering why they were even included in the family tree(?)

The story begins with a mother and her young children, all slaves on a sugar cane plantation in Martinique. The young daughter learns to be a healer, and her story dominates the earliest part of the novel, as she grows and gains friends and enemies on the plantation. It is her niece who first immigrates to Canada, as the slave accompanying two daughters of the plantation owners, who are being sent to Canada for their education. When all slaves in Canada are freed, she takes advantage of her opportunities there and establishes her self, and lays a foundation for the future generations of her family.  I liked the flow of this story, through the generations, and felt that even though the story moved back and forth through the families' history, it had continuity and was fairly easy to follow.

Abeje has a gift for hearing and listening to others which plays a part in future generations. We see the novel transition from their deaths and work their way down the family tree and then back to the beginning.I\u2019ll admit that the lineage was sometimes confusing and I feel like a family tree chart is needed for readers.

It is an interesting novel it\u2019s also laced with sadness and heartbreak as each family member dealing with their own personal struggles. It was also interesting to see the similarities between the American and Canadian sides of the family.I like the rich folklore aspect and how stories were passed down throughout each generation.

The story begins in Martinique with Abeje, a young slave who becomes a great healer. Though she had no children, her brother had one daughter, Hettie, who had to be fostered at another plantation when his wife died. When he finally got leave to visit, he discovered she and her foster mother has been sold away. Fate intervened and Abeje found her when she was ten and he was able to see her once before she went to Montreal, Canada, with the daughters of the family who owned her. There she met Dax Rougeaux, a free black man, who bought her freedom.This is the beginning of the House of Rougeaux.From there, the story jumps ahead a few generations to Nelie and Azzie, cousins and Hettie\u2019s great-great-grandchildren in Philadelphia to Azzie\u2019s youngest sister, then to Martine, Hettie\u2019s great=granddaughter from the part of the family that stayed in Montreal. Then to Hetty, and then her son, and then his daughter. It might seem odd to jump like that, but it comes together beautifully.I enjoyed House of Rougeaux quite a bit. The family\u2019s story is fascinating. There is a touch of magic realism, or maybe, just magic. Abeje is a healer with mystical powers, Josie, Hettie\u2019s youngest, can \u201csee\u201d and so can Nelie. But it\u2019s not about folk medicine and magic, the real magic is family love, the sticking together, supporting each other.Jaeckel does a great job weaving history into her story. There are historical characters in the story, though none of them are part of the Rougeaux family. Their role is organic and rooted in the family\u2019s story, not the other way around.One of my favorite insights in the story was when Hettie reveled in the freedom of her children, how they \u201cwailed wildly\u201d where she had learned to be quiet and subservient. The plot and characters are the strongest elements of House of Rougeaux. Sometimes the prose feels more like the family histories written by my cousins, unadorned, just the facts, ma\u2019am writing. It\u2019s not bad writing, but it is less interesting than the people and their lives.The first and last chapters, though, are magical.House of Rougeaux will be released April 24th.

Jaeckel does not attempt to follow every descendant here--and in the ARC it is noted that the family tree is not finalized (the text mentions more people than are on the tree). I do wish more of the healers recognized their powers (even if not fully harnessed), because they do know, by the last chapter (c1900) that there was a great healer in their ancestry.

The novel starts on Martinque and follows Abeje who was born into slavery. She possesses powers that connect her the island's plant life. She grows into a great healer while also dealing with numerous hardships. What I enjoyed about this story was how easily these elements of magical realism were woven into the narrative. They felt organic and believable and that is essential for a novel that employs magical realism, otherwise it can feel like a gimmick. But I thought Jenny Jaeckel's approach was subtle in how the powers manifested in the future generations of Abeje's family. The magical realism however serves only as one element of the story, what the novel also does well is introduce well rounded characters in the descendants of Abeje. The novel is split into sections that could almost be read as stand alone chapters each dealing with a different family member in a different time period. There is overlap between the characters but often the story will focus on a new generation and the previous characters will serve a periphery role in the new chapter. There were a few moments where I felt the narrative became bogged down in telling rather than showing what was happening to the characters. Though given the short story format for each chapter I can understand why details were omitted. The novel deals with many themes: grief, growing up, self-discovery, sexuality, family ties, and racism. It was written with clear prose, interesting localities, and well crafted characters. One small historical nitpick I came across was the use of daguerreotypes in the late 19th century. They were really only used between 1840-1860. The story in question mentions one being taken in the 1880s where they most likely would have been superseded by newer technology."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Bowyer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42576209-rebecca-bowyer", "userReview": "House of Rougeaux opens with the brutal rape and murder of a young mother right outside the door of the hut where her small children huddle in fear. Abeje and her older brother Adunbi - with barely 10 years of age between them - are left to fend for themselves as slaves on a Caribbean sugar cane plantation in late 18th century Martinique.With the help of the other slaves, the orphans are given enough food to eat until they can work and earn their own small portion.As she grows, Abeje discovers that - to her - the plants have spirits. Eventually they speak to her and she learns she can use their power to heal the sick.We spend around the first quarter of the book with Abeje between 1785-1860. Then we jump to 1949 Philadelphia, then back to 1925 Montreal and then even further back to 1853 Montreal.At this point - about halfway through the book - I was feeling a little lost, trying to follow the threads of the characters and remember who was who and where they fit into the family tree.Then a realisation hit me - House of Rougeaux doesn't really follow characters. It follows the gift of healing and second sight as it's passed down through the generations and inhabits Abeje's descendants around the world.Read my full review on Seeing the Lighter Side."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45969143-susan", "userReview": "The House of Rougeaux follows the descendants of two children who are left motherless on a sugar plantation on the Caribbean island of Martinique in 1785 up until the mid-1960's. I loved the first section of this book which follows Abeje, who eventually becomes a healer and her brother Adunbi. I immediately felt something for these two characters. The hardships and unfortunate circumstances of there lives pulled at my heart. The author had a wonderful ability to transport me to the Caribbean and the reality of their everyday lives. But, I didn't understand why the story jumped from the 1800's to descendants living in the 1950's in the United States and Canada. I think I would have enjoyed this book much more if it had been chronological in order or even if it had omitted the second and third chapter. I was also not a big fan of extremely long chapters often followed by a very short one. It made the story seem unbalanced to me. I liked the ending of the book which followed one descendant Eleanor, who returned to Martinique to find out more about her ancestors, Abeje and Adunbi. I think the author has a gift and talent for creating beautiful prose and being able to draw a reader into the characters. But, I was disappointed with the structure chosen for the work. Thanks to Library Thing for allowing me to read and review this book in exchange for an honest review.More reviews at: www.susannesbooklist.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1120957-sharon", "userReview": "An unusual book in story and writing style, which is concise without overwhelming detail, and yet, there are nice details. The story moves along quickly, changing narrators in one family and the eras in which they lived. There is some \"magic\" woven throughout in that some of the family members have the ability to heal and know what is in another's heart. These members are born with a subtle gift -- an ability to see and understand something that another person has never told them, and the ability to heal physically. Some know plants and herbs in the old ways of many cultures used for healing. The timeline isn't linear. Every generation suffers loss, love, joy and challenges. In the beginning on the island of Martinique, the family members are slaves from Africa. One daughter goes to Quebec City to work. From there. various family members tell their stories, some leading to Paris and other European sites. The family remains strong and connected, taking care of their own. As with all families, life interferes with plans. The family tree near the beginning is helpful in connecting who the characters are as they emerge in the story. It's a soulful story, worth reading. I was dubious during the first chapter, but the story will hook you as you read along and it gets easier and more interconnected. I received this book from Library Thing in ARC format."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2561489-mary", "userReview": "I received this book from LibraryThing's Early Reviewers. The description intrigued me and I hadn't heard of the author before which for me is always a selling point as I'm always looking for new authors to read. (which makes it hard when I do fall in love with an author and want to read all their books - it really makes my TBR list grow faster than my read pile!)House of Rougeaux is a story set in different eras with a variety of characters, all women from the same family. This was an interesting blend of magical realism and historical fiction that I wanted to both rush through and savor all at the same time.I don't know a lot of the history of Africans in Canada so I can't say if this was an accurate portrayal of the time but what I can say is I found it believable and inspired me to read more - which isn't that what reading is all about? To connect and inspire us to cultures we're not familiar with and life experiences that we can learn to appreciate it?"}, {"userName": "Sarah Wagner", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4286301-sarah-wagner", "userReview": "*I received this book through LibraryThing Early Reviewers.*I was originally attracted to this book because I understood it to be set on a Caribbean island (what better setting?!?!), so I was disappointed when the family this book follows moved to Canada about a quarter of the way through the book. Maybe because of this, I found the middle portion of the book the hardest to get through, but by the end I was enjoying the story again and impressed by the breath of what the author tackles in this book - it spans centuries, addresses racism and homosexuality, as well as discuss how one family manages to make their way through. I'm still not certain I liked how the story skipped between characters and time periods, but I can say I liked the ending and the final character to be focused on (who does make it back to that Caribbean island)."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4896869-kathleen", "userReview": "This is a very solid story that, after the first section, never seemed to pull me back in. The first part of the book follows siblings through their lives on a sugar plantation beginning in the 1700's. That story was a bit eerie, a bit mysterious and a bit suspenseful which really held my interest. After that the story follows the ancestors of those siblings through to present day. Those stories were told very much out of chronological order and honestly felt more like short stories as I never felt the connection of some kind of arc to hold them all together. But all in all, this very well written story is definitely worth your time if you enjoy reading historical accounts of families. Thank you to Library Thing and the publisher for providing me with an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review."}], "description": "For Abeje and her brother Adunbi, home is the slave quarters of a Caribbean sugar plantation on the Antilles Island of Martinique.
