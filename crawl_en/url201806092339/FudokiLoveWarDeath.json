I will have to pimp it all over Goodreads now because Fudoki is simply lovely.This book is two stories rolled into one. In 12th century Japan, Harueme, an elderly princess, sits down to write a story that's just itching to get out: of a cat who's turned into a woman and a warrior and has the adventures Harueme never had. Harueme's memoirs intertwine with the story of the cat, without real boundaries between the two. This might be best described as historical fiction, since the fantasy elements are all in the cat's tale and the cat probably doesn't exist, but there's enough ambiguity that it works well as historical fantasy too.This was an unusual reading experience for me. I initially read the first few pages, decided it wasn't the thing for me at the moment, and set it aside, but then found myself thinking about it. And that's the way this book works. There's nothing flashy or in-your-face about it; it draws you in subtly, plays on your emotions without your realizing it, and you slowly come to realize just how good it is. I'm used to reading books through in a mad rush these days, but this is one that demands you slow down and read a little bit at a time. \"Calming\" is a good way to describe it.The stories of both the princess and the cat are compelling, and the character development is quite good, especially with Harueme (the cat-woman is simpler, as cats are, and even in human form her personality resembles that of a cat). Harueme lives in a world of women, and her relationship with her attendant and best friend, Shigeko, is well-done. The writing is also good, and genuinely reads like the voice of an older woman who's learned a lot about life (rather than a younger author trying to sound wise and being trite instead). To quote an example that encapsulates Harueme's outlook on life, and made me smile (background: her uncle and cousin are upset about her rejection of a suitor):\"I knew they could not see me well through the screens, so I learned to slip a small notebook into my sleeve, to have something to read during these visits: if they had nothing useful to say, I saw little reason to attend carefully. I actually read all the way through the Diamond Sutra in this fashion, which I am sure did more for my soul than any remorse they might have hoped to engender.\"Not flashy, but full of thought and humanity. And it also brings me to my last point, which is the setting. Johnson isn't Japanese, but you might not realize from the text; the book is clearly well-researched but the details stay in the background, subtly fleshing it out as needed. The setting feels three-dimensional, and never exoticized. The mythology is interesting and fits very well into the story; I knew I was hooked from the moment the cat encounters a dead woman's ghost trying to shake her body into wakefulness.I'm not quite prepared to give 5 stars--maybe I need a little more flash, the kind of book that will bowl you over--but I am prepared to say that Fudoki is excellent. This is exactly the sort of thing I like--historical fantasy with a non-western setting, focusing on women and their relationships, and with cats--but I think it will appeal to a wider audience too. Now on to Johnson's other book...."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "Cats are too fierce for gods; they came godless from Korea many tens of years ago, and they worship no one. This is good, for they are free in ways men are not; but this is bad, because they are utterly alone in the world. Fudoki is the story of a cat, told by a princess trapped in her rooms by old age, tradition and ill health. But like any great story, it is much more than the surface detail. It is about freedom and courage, love and friendship, conflict and poetry. Set in 11th Century Japan, at the height of the Heian period that was famous for the rigid formalities of court life, for the rise of the military caste, for the writing of classic monogatari epics, for the rise of Buddhist and Chinese influence on the Japanese culture. All of these historical facts are masterfully captured in the pages of Kij Johnson novel, combined with subtle fantasy elements, also typical of Japanese tales: ghosts, animal spirits, kami deities ( they are everywhere, in everything from a family's shrine to a dying cycad-palm on a beach in distant Satsuma province; and their voices are everywhere, all chattering or twittering or intoning at once ).The term  fudoki  is used to describe  self and soul and home and shrine, all in one to a cat  , continuity and tradition and identity through stories. When a feral cat living in an abandoned residence sees her world destroyed in an earthquake and the subsequent firestorm, she loses her  fudoki  and is cast adrift on an epic journey that will gain her the title Kagaya-hime, the Cat Who Traveled a Thousand Miles.The tale of Kagaya-hime is put down on paper as a journal of the last days in the life of Imperial Princess Harueme. Born under a thousand thousand rules, the princess finds solace and escape from her monotonous, cloistered existence in imagining the adventures of the little tortoiseshell cat.The two stories weave around one another, giving meaning and purpose to each other, princess and cat becoming kindred spirits, sisters-in-arms, dream and reality walking side by side. As Princess Harueme recalls the loves and friendships that made her life endurable, so Kagaya-hime learns to abandon her loneliness, her isolation and to relate to the people, animals, and kami that are part of her story.If you are looking for an action packed, edge of the seat thriller, this book most probably will not qualify. It is a poetic meditation, often infused with sadness, mostly contemplative and passive observation of the world. Both main actors are outsiders: Harueme is often forced to look at the world and converse with people from behind a privacy saving curtain, her every gesture and word subject to rules and interdictions; Kagaye-hime is isolated by her predatory instincts, her orphaned status and her fiercely protected independence. The prose of Kij Johnson is a joy to behold, feelings and moods often reflected in nature's shifting landscapes, in the play of rain and wind and moonlight on formal gardens or majestic vistas. The depth of the research is impressive, detailing the aristocratic dance of the Heian nobility, the frankly very liberal courtship traditions of the period (where the women often had the liberty of inviting a favorite into her private chamber, regardless of marriage status), the cultural and social interactions (  Young men and women together in the moonlight breed poetry as oak trees breed mushrooms  .War has a special place in the story. Although the exclusive province of men, women experience it either remotely through the scars left on their brothers and lovers or directly when their house stands in the way of war bands. The research is again exhaustive: the armour, the weapons, the strategies, the economic implications, the extreme cruelty, and the ultimate pointlessness of the exercise, they are all part of the journey of Kagaya-hime.  Well, Takase said, his tone measured, as if he were about to comment on an arrangement of irises. We will kill them. They will kill us. But it will be done. Go on, then.  : this is one of the most chilling and succint discourses from a general before the battle I have ever read.Religion is another aspect explored in the text, beside court manners and warfare. Harueme grows up in the animist tradition of old Japan:  Is not everything filled with kami, every stick and rock and leaf? Perhaps I have been the first to recognize and worship this kami, but that did not mean it had not been there, lonely and hungry for attention, like a bored little girl. Now, so many decades later that I do not choose to count them up, I think there may be another truth to this - that the rock was worthy of worship because it had been worshiped - that every shrine in the world began as mine did, with someone's longing for something greater than herself.  Kagaya-hime is herself led and transformed by kami spirits, wild and unpredictable, probably benevolent, just as likely indifferent to her fate. Animals, as higher life forms than rocks and twigs, share both language and social institutions with humans, not so much different here than in the fables of Aesop and La Fontaine. Some references to events and characters from the previous Kij Johnson novel (The Fox Woman) are present here, but the two stories are largely self contained and can be read independently.If I were to draw a conclusion to the novel, it would be about the importance of stories in defining our fudoki  , of revealing who we are and what our place in the world is: Tales and memories, however inaccurate, are all we have. The things I have owned, the people I have loved - these are all just ink in notebooks that my mind stores in trunks and takes out when it is bored or lonely. It is in the recording of things, in our memories if nowhere else, that makes them real."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7897151-amanda", "userReview": "This was really great! At its core it's about isolation and loneliness and eventually making a home for oneself. It has a dual narrative: Harueme is an elderly dying princess writing the tale of Kagaya-hime, a cat-turned-human with no family, no home, and no fudoki. As Kagaya-hime embarks on a journey to forget the pain and loss in her past, Harueme begins to reflect upon her life and pass judgments on what truly mattered over the years. This book talks a lot about grief and mortality, which I really enjoyed, and came to some profound conclusions that were said in an offhand, humble manner. I loved the landscapes Johnson paints, especially the winter scenes. There were some bits having to do with warfare that didn't interest me as much, but I wasn't bogged down by it, either. I'll be reading everything that Kij Johnson writes in the future!"}, {"userName": "Kaitlin", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin", "userReview": "I picked this book up as it counted for the challenge of reading a book which focuses on a PoC character, and this one follows a Japanese cat-woman, Kagaya-hime, and a Japanese Princess, Harueme. We follow the story of two lives, the first is our Princess, Harueme, who is now in her late seventies and is reminiscing about her life and the things she misses or enjoyed. We get to follow her tale through her notebooks as she writes in her old age to tell her life story.We also follow through Harueme's notebooks, the story of Kagaya-hime. A young cat-woman who is lost after the rest of her family are killed in a fire, and so she transforms into a woman and yet retains much of her cat-soul in the transformation. She doesn't really understand the ways of humans, and we follow her as she tries to understand them and learn from them. Overall, this is a solidly interesting story with a lot of reference to the Japanese culture and the influences are told beautifully throughout. I really enjoyed experiencing the life of the princess Harueme and seeing how she was an older character in a fantasy book was really refreshing too.The Japanese elements come largely from folklore of Japan and we see Gods and spirit animals on the stage of the story too. I really found that there was a lot to learn and love about these tales and the Fudoki was something vitally important to the cats of this book.I also think Kij Johnson did a really good job of personifying the cat at times and making her seem realistic but fun and lazy all at once, just as a cat should be! I ended up giving it a 2.5*s as it was fun, but some sections were a bit slower paced than I would have liked and there was a fair amount of battle/fighting in the latter half too."}, {"userName": "Nesa Sivagnanam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/315458-nesa-sivagnanam", "userReview": "Fudoki by Kij Johnson. I have to admit that I picked up the book because the cover illustration is of a Japanese warrior cat woman.The story is set in a Japanese myth-influenced universe and revolves around Kagaya-hime. She may be a woman. She's sometimes a warrior or a philosopher or even a reluctant friend. She may truly be a cat or perhaps is a figment of the imagination of a dying princess.The tale moves between the princess who might be making it up and writing it down in the twilight of her life; and Kagaya-hime, the cat woman.She was a cat living with a clan. She had her own fudoki - an oral history of all the female cats in her clan. A fire kills all the cats so she loses her tale, her fudoki. And without a tale, she is no one. She cannot join another fudoki without losing herself so she chooses to walk along the Tokaido road because it, unlike her, knows where it's going. She only recognised that the Tokaido had a direction, a meaning, and this made it unlike her.Along the way she meets the kami of Japan, Gods who in their curiosity about this creature new to Japan, give her a human shape. Not a cat but not quite a woman either. Her nature is that of a cat. Her eyes see further, her ears are sharper. She hunts and kills like a cat.She does not understand the change or why it has happened, only that it has. So she journeys along the road and all the while the princess writes and breathes her life away. The end is perhaps the surprise and you get to decide how much of a choice we all really have in the vast scheme of the universe. Do we walk freely or are we sometimes nudged along paths because at the end of the path there is one waiting who has a great need for us. And we might not have chosen that path on our own.Fudoki is a tale of two journeys perhaps. It's looking in the mirror of the Other and perhaps seeing onself truly. The prose is elegant. It's moves along the pages with a feline grace. There are sentences and paragraphs that strike chords deep inside and I think we will all see something of ourselves in the cat or the princess or both.\"What are these voices?\"\"The gods,\" the kami said. \"The eight million gods, speaking all at once.\"\"Are they all roads?\"\"That would be a lot of roads. No. They are peace. War. Rice, barley. A thousand forges, ten thousand gates. This lake, that pond, the other river... A tree, all trees, a forest, all forests...\"\"How can there be so many of you, and I have never met a god before this?\"\"How would you know if you met one? You cats live in a cat-shaped world...\"\"And now I am not even a cat,\" she said bitterly.\"You are no more and no less than you ever were,\" the kami said. \"You lost nothing that was yours in the first place.\"and in the end ...\"Who says you are on a different road than you were,\" the kami said. \"There are a lot of roads, and they go everywhere. Some of them can't be seen. You are coming to the end of this one.\"\"But then what?\" she said, her eyes filling with tears.\"You will settle down. make a new fudoki.\"\"Alone?\"....\"When's the last time you wre alone? You tale is a thousand long already - men, women, horses....\"She opened her mouth to speak, but a thought came to her and she said nothing, her mouth gaping open, forgotten. \"I never tried,\" she finally said. \"I wept and complained and mourned, but I never thought... But why?\"You needed a home. Could a cat come a thousand miles?....\"\"Did I come here or was I summoned?\" ....In the end I loved the book perhaps because of the cat or maybe it was the journey and the way it played out in the end. It's a book I see myself re-reading again and again."}, {"userName": "Phoenixfalls", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3265230-phoenixfalls", "userReview": "First, I have to say, that jacket description is riddled with so many small inaccuracies about this story that I was tempted not to include it. They aren't fundamentally important inaccuracies -- though it is very important to realize that the \"she\" referred to at the start of the second paragraph is Kagaya-hime, not the \"aging empress\" who isn't an empress at all -- but it bugs me now that I've read the story to see how wrong it is. Ah well, moving on.This is a wonderful book, sure to appeal to fans of Patricia McKillip and Catherynne Valente, though it's more accessible than either of their work. It's very much rooted in the myths of Japan, and while I don't know a ton about the time period, nothing of what I do know was contradicted by what Johnson wrote, so I am assuming that she captured the era (Heian-era Japan I believe) with some degree of accuracy. Like in McKillip and Valente's work, this is not fantasy that lovingly details a set of rules for its magic system; it is fantasy where there are gods and there are humans and there are animals and the lines between these things are not sharp at all, where anything can happen and no one is much surprised when anything does. Logic plays a role, but it's dream logic, and the worst error to commit is in assuming that any other being's motivations match our own.But what made this book brilliant (and caused it to be nominated for the James Tiptree, Jr. Award) is the way in which it is fundamentally a womens' fantasy. The fudoki of the cats is entirely female; there is no place for males, and none of the fudoki cares to even know the names of the toms that fathered their kittens. Harueme (this would be the aging noblewoman narrating Kagaya-hime's tale, half-sister to the former Emperor Shirakawa) also lives in an almost entirely female world, where women have husbands and lovers but their days are spent hidden from male sight (and even the seductions take place with an eye to maintaining the illusion that no man can see their faces). Harueme loved her half-brother, and reminisces about her soldier-lover Domei, but the most important relationship she has is with her attendant, Shigeko. The novel even acknowledges that women menstruate -- I'm pretty sure I can count on one hand the SF/F novels that do that -- and there are elaborate (historically-based, I assume) codes of conduct built around that simple fact of life. It's a novel about women's issues: family and home and place in a society when all of those things are rigidly proscribed.It works on a pure fantasy level too, with the cat-transformed-into-a-human element and the presence of the kami (which are a whole class of gods, not the name of a specific god as the jacket implies) and even a small war of revenge that leads to a seige; and I'm pretty sure it works as historical fiction, though as I've said I don't know very much about the time period so I can't attest to its accuracy. But it will linger in my memory because it shows a slice of life fantasy novels too often forget, not with any particular message, but just because these are stories that rarely get told. I wish there were more novels like this."}, {"userName": "Siria", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria", "userReview": "I cannot remember who it was who recommended this novel to me, so I will just have to thank the happy serendipity which caused my eye to fall upon it while I was pottering around in the Forbidden Planet in London, and made me pick it up. The prose is a delight--vivid and subtle and precise--full of insights which are sharp without ever being overstated. Johnson also manages to interweave the two main strands of the story incredibly well--of Princess Harueme, old and slowly dying, and of the cat-turned-woman, Kagaya-hime. They are never made truly distinct from one another, flowing from Harueme's story to Kagaya-hime's and back again. In the hands of a lesser writer, such a story-telling device would be confusing, but Johnson makes it work incredibly well for her. This is apparently the successor to a previous novel, which is definitely going on my to-look-for list."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162759-margaret", "userReview": "Fudoki is an entrancing fantasy set in medieval Japan. Johnson skillfully interweaves the reminiscences of an aging princess with the tale the princess is writing of a woman turned into a cat, who may or may not exist outside the princess's imagination. The language is exquisitely precise, with never a wasted word, and the portrayal of medieval Japan brilliantly vivid."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1392534-catherine", "userReview": "This is an extraordinarily beautiful book, written in clear, sweet, lyrical prose that I found so calming, I could only read it before bed. (A bizarre quirk of mine, perhaps? But I tried to read this over breakfast one morning, and found my thoughts - racing ahead to anticipate the day - completely unsuited to the gracefulness of the prose, and so I made it a bedtime-only read.)There are two stories in this book - that of the elderly Princess Harueme, and that of Kagaya-hime, a cat who takes on a woman's shape for reasons that she does not understand. In the beginning the tales are separate - Harueme writes Kagaya-hime's tale to occupy her as she prepares to leave the Emeperor's palace and go into a convent to die - but somewhere along the way they begin to weave together. The blurring of boundaries between the two women's tales is masterfully done, and not every segue is apparent until you're deeply inside the thoughts and feelings of the opposite woman to the one with whom you began. \"We\" and \"I\" become loaded terms that pull you, as the reader, into the text as well - the book itself loses its boundaries, and the tale becomes a living thing that encompasses all female experience.That said, the subject matter is not dainty, or sheltered, or female by the measure of any particular trope. Princess Harueme loves beetles and mice, loved to draw the wings of birds as a child, has read as much about war as she can lay her hands on. Kagaya-hime travels long distances, defends herself when attacked, hunts and comforts and fights, on her own and with others. Between the two tales we see the measure of a woman as defined by convention, and the measure of a woman defined by herself.And the ending - oh, the ending is exquisite, and I put down the book and just smiled happily into empty space when I was done. Such a lovely, lovely book."}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2162453-kris", "userReview": "Ancient Japan fascinates me and I can't think of a more interesting time that Heian-kyo, 11th century in Japan's old capital now known as Kyoto. While this story takes place in late Heian - 1129, I believe the author mentioned - it has all the charm and cultural nuances one would expect. Sei Shonagan finds her name in these pages, as does Murasaki Shikibu. We read about ancient Japanese marriage customs and war and seiges. We learn about the life of the gods that govern and of times of hardship.We follow the life of a cat who suddenly finds herself in woman-form on a quest though she does not yet know it because she is just 'nothing and no one'. This is also a tale of an old Heian princess as she slowly fades away from this world to the next, some unnamed tumor growing inside her killing her a bit day after day.It is a sweet story of life, loss, and home and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved reading about Kagaya-hime (even if her name is so similar to Kaguya-hime that I kept thinking of the moon!) and of Harueme, the 70+ year old princess scribbling away her last days in her journal before she finally moves on.

It is such a unique book based on Japanese myth that is beautifully written - it is an adventure that will have you engaged until the very end. I thoroughly enjoyed the two storylines of Harueme and the cat woman Kagaya-hime, and it is the type of book that you just don't want to end. Johnson did a phenomenal job at making both narratives engaging and I can't pick a favourite. I also loved the setting of 11th century Japan and it was interesting to learn more about court life, especially for the women.

The first is about a cat who, after the death of her clan (in the story, cats live in clans) in a fire, decides to strike out along the road that runs north from Kyoto, and is turned into a woman partway there by the spirit (or kami) of the road. Subsequently she makes friends with a noblewoman she meets on the road and ends up being involved in a small but vicious war between noble families in the north, which is technically part of the Japanese Empire but is still fairly wild and appears to have considerable autonomy. To contrast with this rather fantastical story \u2014 it\u2019s not just that the cat is turned into a woman, and that the kami continues to provide her with whatever she needs, up to and including servants, as she travels along, but also that she is so easily accepted as a woman who is really a cat by the other characters \u2014 we have the other half of the book, which is essentially the autobiography of the royal princess Harueme, who is writing the cat\u2019s story. Since she is also dying of cancer, she has a strong incentive to look back over her life, and it becomes increasingly clear that the cat\u2019s story is merely a chance for Harueme to think about her life from an unexpected angle: in particular, to think about the love of her life, Domei, a guardsman from the north whose leaving she still mourns, though it happened decades ago. This is an interesting idea: unfortunately, as the story of the cat-woman continues, and it becomes more and more a way for us to watch Harueme think about events and people that she has avoided thinking about for years, its intrinsic interest decreases, mainly because its fantastical elements increasingly appear to be simply imposed from the outside by its author (Harueme, that is) to push the story in the direction she wants it to go. The way that this sheds light on Harueme\u2019s thinking does not compensate for the damage this does to the credibility of the cat-woman\u2019s story, especially since the sections of the book that are simply Harueme describing her life and musing about her past are both more enlightening and more interesting. By the middle of the book, I found myself no longer much caring what happened to the cat-woman. Which is fine, as Harueme is more than interesting enough to carry the book by herself, but I think that ideally the proportion of the book devoted to the cat-woman\u2019s story would be reduced as the book goes along and Harueme increasingly assumes center stage. Once the cat-woman\u2019s story becomes a slog, Harueme\u2019s story is inevitably affected as well. Johnson\u2019s novel \u201cThe Fox Woman\u201d (some characters from which appear in the cat-woman\u2019s story) does a better job as an adaptation of Japanese folktales about magical transformations, and her story \u201cThe Cat Who Walked a Thousand Miles\u201d is better as the story of a cat who travels a long distance in Japan. However, Harueme\u2019s character is enough to keep you reading: an intelligent and strong-willed woman trapped in the restrictions of Japanese imperial court life, she\u2019s not necessarily all that original, but Johnson does an excellent job creating her voice, and the reader ends up far more invested in her past than in the cat-woman\u2019s future. (Credit should also be given to Johnson\u2019s research, the breadth and depth of which is readily apparent.)"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5138216-kim", "userReview": "I was a little disappointed after reading this book because I had first read The Fox Woman by Kij Johnson and the voice of the narrative was so different. What I had liked most about The Fox Woman was the way it was written: very wistful and almost romantic while still remaining mystical and supernatural. I also loved the poems written by each of the characters. None of that was in this sequel. When I first started to read, the tragedy that occurred to the tortoiseshell cat drew me in and I wanted to know more and wanted to see what would happen to the cat. However, once she transformed into a woman, I lost my desire to continue reading for a good part of the book(I did continue, though). What had made me sigh in disappointment was the fact that once she had been turned into a human, in what was (sort of) meant to be a punishment or road to understanding, everything that she needed just magically appeared. A farmer's wife asked if she carried needles, and suddenly she did. Often things would appear out of no where even if she didn't even realize that she had needed them because she had never been near humans and didn't know about these things. Knives, a sword, a bow and arrows, needles, a horse, servants...she did not ask for them and didn't know she needed them, and yet they were magically provided. Now, at the very end of the story I realized the reason why these things magically appeared, but it was still distracting every time it happened until the point in the story where the reason is hinted at (at least for me). As a reader, I felt that too many things were being provided to her so freely, especially if the one who turned her into this form was seemingly upset with her. I expected a little more hardship, I suppose. Otherwise, the tortoiseshell's story was very engrossing and I read it mainly for the cat.However, mixed in with the story of the cat is the story of the court woman writing the cat's story. In the beginning of the book, I didn't really want to read about the court woman. Slowly over the course of the book, I began to want to know more and more about her. In the end, I ended up wanting to skip the parts with the cat to see what would happen to the court woman. I ended up being fascinated by the rules a court woman from that time period in Japan had to live by. Overall, this was a very good book, but for me it definitely lacked a bit in the middle."}, {"userName": "Tom Whalley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7547216-tom-whalley", "userReview": "I can't seem objective about this book and I won't even try. Fudoki is a great dang book about cats and the people who love them.The novel follows two stories. First is the story of an elderly Japanese princess with lung cancer, in feudal times, as she comes to terms with her death and muses on her life. She reflects back on the servants she has lived with, the people she has loved and the way her life had lead down. It's quiet and reflective, in the way that any good book about someone who is dying should be. There's nothing amazing or special to be said here, it isn't a literary masterpiece, it's just a story of an old lady winding down for the big nap as she writes her memoirs. Then there's the second story. The one I can't be objective about. The princess's diaries, it turns out, are the stories she writes of a cat who lost her family. Distraught, she becomes a woman and a warrior, because as a cat she is nothing. It's the most dang cat thing I've read, all the way through. Reading with my cats alternating between wrestling over my legs and purring on my chest only added to the cattery. Such cat.I loved that this book was very female. One story is about how a woman can be defined through culture; the other a woman defined through nothing but her own actions. In the world of cats, male cats have no real cultural purpose. In the world of humans, we never interact with a single man. It disappointed me a bit that the character of Domei is just talked about, and in some chapters to extreme lengths, rather than given any stage time. It's only a disappointment because in reference, Domei sounds so interesting but oh well.Sadly, the book isn't really that great, if I'm honest. The first fifty to a hundred pages are fantastic and then... things just sort of keep happening for a bit and then there's a perfectly adequate ending that... well, it just happens. It's not a bad book by any means, and if you already like cats then dang read the heck out of this, but otherwise it's just... there."}, {"userName": "Sadie Forsythe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5634574-sadie-forsythe", "userReview": "It took me a full 120 pages to finally get truly interested in this book. It's jut so very slow. Now, it's meant to be. It's about a dying old woman who, while writing a fictional story, is contemplated her life. From the very beginning there was a lot to think about, but I was honestly bored. However, once Hime becomes human things pick up a little...or maybe I had finally just adjusted to the slow pace. But once I got past the slow pace, I was really impressed with this as a contemplation on place\u2014the idea of one's social place, place as a physical location and the intersection of these ideas that construct our sense of ourselves (Fudoki). Harueme is a princess\u2014daughter, grandaughter, sister and aunt to emperors. But this same high rank (place in society) is a prison of sort, keeping her in her place dreaming of being free, of seeing the world and new places. She is never allowed to escape her place, physical or cultural. While simultaneously, Hime is a cat who has lost her Fudoki, her place and therefore the sense and understand of self that it provided. She spends the whole book looking for a place to be her and her own.If you're looking for a contemplative read and have any interest in 11th century Japanese culture I recommend picking this one up."}, {"userName": "Patricia J.

It is slow, sort of meditative in style, following the preparation for death of an aged princess. She is cleaning out her belongings, including many notebooks of writing, but she finds she needs to fill some blank ones with one last story.That tale of a cat who loses her home and travels far, turning into a cat-woman and warrior as she journeys, mingles with Princess Harueme's memories of her sequestered life and of her lost dreams.Their stories become more complex, intense, and fulfilling as Fudoki moves toward its conclusion.I love beautiful writing and this book is filled with it.Here are a couple of examples:\"She was learning something about grief, that it begins with a great blow, but heals with a thousand tiny strokes.\"\"There was a day, beautiful and surprisingly cold: autumn, though winter was a clear omen in the air. The forest shivered gold and red and pine-green in the wind.

I can tell that it's not a favourite, because I didn't devour it or feel any need to be completely immersed in the novels, but it was lovely.The way that Johnson flicked between the tale of Kagaya-hime, Harueme's present life, and Harueme's past, was wonderfully done and it never confused me. There's nothing more irritating than an author writing a story in this convoluted way, but not having the skill to do it well. The relationship between Harueme and Shigeko was beautifully written and Johnson perfectly depicted the strong bond of female friendship and love. Oh, and the writing was goddamn perfect.There's nothing I can pick out that I disliked about this book, it just didn't have that \"wow\" factor to make it a favourite.

For winter... maybe The Dark is Rising.We got no further than that. I might choose the LotR trilogy for autumn, because of that bittersweet sense of loss and fulfillment that I always feel at its conclusion, but then I choose LotR for a lot of things.Fudoki is not a seasonal book, save perhaps in the sense that our lives themselves have seasons. In that case, it might feel like autumn and also like spring. I would call it a journeying book; I've seldom felt such a sense of passage and change and destination, in reading any story. There is the journey of the storyteller, a static meandering backwards and forwards in her own life as she writes the story of a cat's journey in a series of notebooks. And that story is both a literal journey in space and geography, and more metaphysical, in spirit and philosophy and maturation.I read once that if you follow any story too far, it always ends in death. Fudoku does not avoid that. BUT - uniquely, there is no sorrow here; only the anticipation of a new adventure, a different life, a continuing journey.In \"Grimbold's Other World,\" a childless queen, aging but beautiful, weeps over the lines on her face, mourns that the knights she sends out to seek her perfect flower no longer return with the flowers of spring, no longer journey for very long. A boy asks her why she would weep for spring when summer has come, and she challenges him to carry his metaphor further, into autumn and then winter. What flower, what hope would he offer her in winter?Perhaps, he says, the promise of another spring.That is the journey that Fudoki takes; a long journey through winter, and a promise of renewal after that. It's very beautiful. I read it in two sittings because it carried me irresistibly forward. To speak merely of craft, the juxtaposition of the story-teller's life against the cat's life is deftly handled, and - unusually, I find - I was equally interested in each. I love both these women. I love the thought of their lives continuing after this story ends, for however long, and I feel that I can sense the shape that they take.This book is also a lovely comment on the reality of those things we create; that these characters we joy and sorrow with are as real or moreso than the people we actually spend our lives with. That being the case, I am infinitely glad to add these characters to the company of those I travel with."}, {"userName": "SWC", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27184334-swc", "userReview": "[ It is revealed that Kagaya-hime is real and that Harueme has escaped the confines of the palace in order to meet the cat.

It had better characters and a better story. Both Kagaya-hime and Harume are interesting and likable, but you never get overly familiar with them since they are both people who tend to stand apart from others either due to social status or the fact that cats are just very aloof. Although the story had an overall melancholy tone, it had a hopeful ending. My only complaint is the way that the author uses Japanese words. She will write the phrase \"kaze-cold\" instead of using either \"kaze\" or \"cold\". It's like how fan translators would say \"All according to keikaku (translator's note: keikaku means plan)\". In the place where she uses them, it doesn't make sense, since there's a perfectly acceptable translation that means the same thing. It was like she was using them to further emphasize the foreignness of the story, but it came across as someone who knows a little bit of Japanese trying to show off to people who don't. It was annoying, but it didn't detract from the story too much for me."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13620246-denise", "userReview": "This is a very interesting book with two main characters: the cat turned woman turned warrior Kagaya-hime and the elderly Japanese princess Harumae. Kagaya-hime is the character in a story being told/written about by Harumae. Both characters wrestle with loneliness and strictures that prevent them from being able to participate fully in the worlds into which they have been thrust. But at the same time, neither woman can take her place in the world in which she longs to be (for Kagaya-hime, this is the colony of cats that was once her home; for Harumae, it is the larger world which she longs to see). But the book ends on a hopeful note, pointing out that it's never too late to have at least some taste of the world you want to join if you are determined enough, brave enough, and helped enough in your goal.

Eventually, the two tales intersect, as it becomes clear how the story of the cat reflects many of Harume's long denied wishes-- for travel, for meaningful relationships, for anything outside the narrow life of a princess of the empire. For all the adventure and mysticism in Kagaya-hime's story in particular, this is a novel that deals with memory and death and sacrifices; both tales are surprisingly melancholy.

This novel follows an aging princess in 12th century Japan named Harueme. She knows she is at the end of her life, so she decides to write in various notebooks that she finds. She relates bits of her life and a story of a cat turned into a woman, Kagaya-Hime. Kagaya - Hime lost her family in a fire when she was a cat and therefore lost her fudoki: her story, \u2018herself\u2019 and her family. She sets out on a journey where she gets turned into a woman warrior and discovers the truth about fudoki. Storyline:I really enjoyed the story in Fudoki. I liked the combination of Harueme\u2019s story and Kagaya-Hime\u2019s story. It was a quieter, more meditative story than I expected, but I enjoyed that. Harueme\u2019s story you would think would not be interesting. An old woman relating her unexceptional life. I really enjoyed her section though. More than Kagaya-Hime\u2019s, which is not what I expected. Kagaya Hime\u2019s was still interesting though. The magical elements of her turning from cat to woman and back again was cool and something I liked reading about as a cat lover. The inclusion of some Shinto beliefs such as Kami and the like were interesting as well. There is a period of time where Kagaya-Hime goes to war and that was probably my least favorite part. I didn\u2019t see much point in the relation of that to be honest. The themes of love, death, family and the power of stories/ our personal histories were all themes I loved the contemplation of. Setting:Fudoki is set in 12th century Japan. I really liked the setting. I\u2019ve mentioned it before, but I have a thing for books set in Japan, especially in the past. This time period was new to me and I really enjoyed reading about it. I thought the setting was done well with some lyrical description. Characters:Harueme I liked a great deal. I enjoyed her reflections on her life. Kagaya- Hime was harder to like to be honest. She was interesting though and there were moments I felt for her. The fact that she was really a cat made me like her more than I would have otherwise. Harueme and Kagaya-Hime seemed like they were in an interesting juxtaposition to see eachother. Kagaya-Hime has a free life where she gets to travel and see lots of different places, which is what Harueme seems to long for. While Hareume has had a solid life with family (even though she never married or had kids) and a story to tell aka what Kagaya-Hime calls Fudoki and longs for. While the story mainly focuses on Harueme and Kagaya-Hime, there were some good side characters too. Shigeko, Harueme\u2019s main attendant was a great character. Shirakawa, Harueme\u2019s half brother and former emperor was also. Kitsune, a man who is half fox was an interesting character as well. Did I Like It?:Yes! I did really enjoy Fudoki. I didn\u2019t quite fall in love with it as I was hoping to, but it was still a really good book. I am interested in picking up the other book set in this Japanese Myth inspired universe by Kij Johnson called The Fox Woman and I am also interested in her short story collection that I have heard good things about called At the Mouth of the River of Bees. Do I Recommend It?:Yes! If you like historical fiction, subtle fantasy based on myth/folklore or books set in Japan, this could be a book for you!"}], "description": "Enter the world of Kagaya-hime, a sometime woman warrior, occasional philosopher, and reluctant confidante to noblemen--who may or may not be a figment of the imagination of an aging empress who is embarking on the last journey of her life, setting aside the trappings of court life and reminiscing on the paths that lead her to death.For she is a being who started her journey on the kami, the spirit road, as a humble tortoiseshell feline. Her family was destroyed by a fire that decimated most of the Imperial city, and this loss renders her taleless, the only one left alive to pass on such stories as The Cat Born the Year the Star Fell, The Cat with a Litter of Ten, and The Fire-Tailed Cat. Without her fudoki--self and soul and home and shrine--she alone cannot keep the power of her clan together. And she cannot join another fudoki, because although she might be able to win a place within another clan, to do so would mean that she would cease to be herself.So a small cat begins an extraordinary journey. Along the way she will attract the attention of old and ancient powers. Gods who are curious about this creature newly come to Japan's shores, and who choose to give the tortoiseshell a human shape.", "title": "Fudoki\n      \n          (Love/War/Death #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189015.Fudoki", "average": 4.01, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442167651l/189015.jpg", "reviews": 109, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/110153.Kij_Johnson", "name": "Kij Johnson"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Historical", "Cultural", "Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189015.Fudoki", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12748937-fudoki", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29635545-the-dream-quest-of-vellitt-boe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12970063-at-the-mouth-of-the-river-of-bees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189022.The_Fox_Woman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10452275-ponies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189023.Dragon_s_Honor"]}
