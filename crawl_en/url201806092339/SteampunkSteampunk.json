Unfortunately, if I didn't know that already, and had to base my judgement on this collection of short stories, then I would probably conclude that I really don't like Steampunk. I mean, I like the concepts of most of these stories, at least those I could figure out after getting past all of the \"look how smart I am as a writer\" entries. But the execution of those concepts was lacking in fine story-telling technique. This is something I'm finding with way too many of these science fiction anthologies being released in recent years. It seems the editors are all so intent upon showing how intelligent they are and forget to include some actual decent stories in their collections. The modern literatti are alive and well in the science fiction marketplace.The only thing saving this collection, at least marginally, is the essay at the end of the book by Rick Law which covers the history of steampunk in print and on film. Although I disagree with his opinions on which are the best, particulary with his utter disdain for certain movies, at least he provides some thought provoking history.Perhaps I should stick to the classics by Jules Verne, HG Wells, and continue to hunt down proper steampunk novelists such as Tim Powers and Mark Hodder."}, {"userName": "Bryan Alexander", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander", "userReview": "The VanderMeers have assembled a fine anthology. It surveys the steampunk world through multiple approaches, genres, and voices. Short stories work through alternate history, American tall tale, mad science satire, Victorian labor politics, detective story, and New Weird, ranging tonally from whimsy to melancholy and horror.Let me note a few standouts.Mary Gentle's \"A Sun in the Attic\" offers splendidly economical world-building without sacrificing characterization and story arc. It sets up an intriguingly alternative gender politics, then upends its semi-medieval setting with a lunge towards technology critique... all in under 19 pages.James Blaylock's \"Lord Kelvin's Machine\" takes me back to the 1980s, when I first encountered this writer and his friends, Tim Powers and KW Jeter, the latter who coined the steampunk term. \"Machine\" has all the signature Blaylock traits: gentle whimsy, a love of food, improbable science, and an ambling plot.Rachel Pollock's \"Reflected Light\" casts itself as a historical document, transcribed wax cylinder recordings of a worker talking about her friend and activists. It's fragmentary, allusive, and nearly heartbreaking.Joe Lansdale's \"Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider\" is a crazed remix of The Time Machine, 19th-century steam robot stories, the American tall tale tradition, flying saucers, Dracula, and a looping space shuttle plot. It's quite disgusting and funny.Ted Chiang's \"Seventy-Two Letters\" offers a welcome steampunk turn to labor, using golems to get at a left politics all too often absent from this subgenre.Paul Di Filippo's \"Victoria\" is a slightly insane riff on the steampunk monarch, working in newts (a la Capek), sex obsessions, and mad science.Stepan Chapman's \"Minutes of the Last Meeting\" takes us away from the English-speaking world, imagining an alternative Russian empire. Michael Chabon\u2019s \u201cThe Martian Agent\u201d is a full-tilt adventure, a boy's own ripping yarn set in an alternate, British dominated (former) America. Huge sentences string together leaps of time and description, always thundering forward. Naturally it leaves us wanting more.So why steampunk? This collection gives us some clues.First, it's a playground for alternate history. Like Gibson and Sterling's Difference Engine, these stories often assume a nineteenth-century past tweaked or otherwise strongly marked by scientific and technological advances. Like alternative WWIIs, steampunk provides the prebuilt concept, which authors can dive into.Second, the Victorian period is at a fine remove. It's far away enough that mocking or using it risks offending nobody, but close enough that the cultural resonances still work.Third, building on the second, Steampunk's authors can poke at contemporary issues through that not-so-distant mirror. Unlike other steampunk works, this collection doesn't obsess over style. We get enough description of goggles, brass, long dresses, dirigibles, etc. to make the point, but without taking over tales. The anthology complements steampunk clothes makers.Also different is the way these authors don't seem to be fleeing from their present. Their imagined alt.pasts are not refuges from the past couple of decades.I haven't mentioned the collection's nonfiction essays, which are generally serviceable. (Kudos for celebrating Luther Awkwright) One useful thought comes from Jess Nevin's introduction:The Edisonade is American. Steampunk, though written by writers of many nationalities, is English. (9)I'm enjoying rethinking steampunk through that lens.Overall, a solid collection for the topic, well worth reading for anyone with a steampunk interest."}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1769635-derek", "userReview": "[software piracy, reverse engineering, and intellectual property disputes (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Stefan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2167401-stefan", "userReview": "Steampunk is an anthology of, well, steampunk stories, edited by Ann and Jeff Vandermeer. If you hurry, you can still get to this first anthology before the second one, Steampunk II: Steampunk Reloaded, appears in mid November. Based on the quality of the stories in this collection, I heartily recommend checking it out, especially if you\u2019ve been a bit bemused (or possibly amused) by all the people wearing odd Victorian costumes at SFF conventions nowadays, or if you have at best a vague idea of what steampunk exactly entails. If you\u2019re one of those people who\u2019s interested in, but not entirely sure about, the new hot subgenre du jour (like me, prior to reading Steampunk), this anthology is here to take you by the hand and give you a quick, entertaining education. And oh, it also contains some truly excellent short stories.After the preface by editors Ann and Jeff Vandermeer, Steampunk starts off with an excellent essay by Jess Nevins about the origins and history of steampunk, including interesting details about the American Edisonades, references to other predecessors such as H.G. Wells and Jules Verne and to \u201cproto-steampunk\u201d like Michael Moorcock\u2019s The Warlord of the Air, an excerpt of which is used as the \u201cBenediction\u201d for the anthology. Most interestingly, the essay gives a partial explanation for the -punk suffix: \u201cSteampunk, like all good punk, rebels against the system it portrays (Victorian London or something quite like it), critiquing its treatment of the underclass, its validation of the privileged at the cost of everyone else, its lack of mercy, its cutthroat capitalism. Like the punks, steampunk rarely offers a solution to the problems it decries \u2014 for steampunk, there is no solution \u2014 but for both punk and steampunk the criticism must be made before the change can come.\u201d Nevins then goes on to explain that this may only apply to first generation steampunk, and that the politics have mostly disappeared from the current wave \u2014 which might explain why some have complained that there isn\u2019t anything \u201cpunk\u201d about steampunk and that it\u2019s more about mannerisms and nostalgia. While that may apply to much of the more recent output in the subgenre, reading some of the older stories in this collection will definitely show that the -punk part of the subgenre\u2019s name wasn\u2019t just put there to make it sound like cyberpunk.Be all of that as it may, after you\u2019re done with all the scholarly debate, steampunk is like any other genre or subgenre or whatever you want to call it: some of it is seminal, some of it is excellent, some it is derivative but still good, and some of it is just people hitching their wagon to the latest fad. Whether you like steampunk or not, it\u2019s hard to argue with the fact that The Vandermeers have done an outstanding job with this collection: most of these stories are simply excellent pieces of short-form speculative fiction.The anthology starts off with a bang with \u201cLord Kelvin\u2019s Machine\u201d by James P. Blaylock, a wild and surreal story that displays steampunk working on the grandest of scales. It\u2019s entertaining, wild and a bit silly \u2014 and a great way to kick off the collection.\u201cThe Giving Mouth\u201d by Ian R. MacLeod, slows things down considerably. I enjoyed and admired the author\u2019s steampunk-ish novels The Light Ages and The House of Storms (\u201c-ish\u201d because they\u2019re set in a version of Victorian England in which the economy is powered by magic rather than steam). This story is set in a different universe but shares the same melancholy atmosphere. However, it doesn\u2019t work as well here and feels a bit out of place.The collection then picks up steam (sorry) with the wonderful \u201cA Sun in the Attic\u201d by Mary Gentle, set in a matriarchal alternate universe that vaguely resembles the Victorian era. This little gem is one of those stories that make you wish for more material set in the same world.Jay Lake\u2019s \u201cThe God-Clown is Near\u201d is the first story in the anthology working on the Golem myth. It\u2019s a fun, dark, surreal story that, as I\u2019ve come to expect from this author, is simply delightful.Things get much darker with Joe R. Lansdale\u2019s \u201cThe Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A DIME NOVEL,\u201d which puts a brusque twist on the Traveler from H.G. Wells\u2019 The Time Machine. This story is dark and violent, full of rape and torture, and while its concept is unique, it may be a bit much for some readers.\u201cThe Selene Gardening Society\u201d by Molly Brown also builds on a steampunk predecessor (this time From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne) but in a much more whimsical and funny way.Next up is Ted Chiang\u2019s \u201cSeventy-Two Letters,\u201d which picks up the golem theme again and ties in a few other ideas, resulting in a memorable story \u2014 not that you\u2019d expect anything less from Ted Chiang.Michael Chabon\u2019s \u201cThe Martian Agent\u201d features some of the most gorgeous prose in the anthology, and thanks to its title, feels like the first chapter in a larger tale. Reading this story bumped the author much closer to the top of my endless \u201cmust-read-more-by\u201d list.Paul Di Filippo\u2019s \u201cVictoria\u201d is one of the funniest and most inventive stories in the collection, featuring newt-based human life and a hilarious uber-villain. This irreverent story (which manages to call the entire royal succession into question) is so over the top that it\u2019s sure to make you grin a few times.The biggest surprise for me was \u201cReflected Light\u201d by Rachel E. Pollock, an elegant and intricate short tale that implies much more than it states outright and almost begs to be reread. This story about illegal underground manufacturing hints at upcoming social changes in a fascinating society that hopefully will host more stories. It also displays the political side of steampunk in a very succinct way.Another surprise is Stepan Chapman\u2019s \u201cMinutes of the Last Meeting\u201d, set in Tzarist Russia. This brilliant story switches viewpoints frequently and somehow manages to introduce a new mind-bending layer of innovation every time, right up to the stunning ending.Last but not least, the editors throw in a treat: a short story by Neal Stephenson set in the same universe as his post-cyberpunk/neo-Victorian novel The Diamond Age. Calling this steampunk is probably a bit of a stretch, but who cares \u2014 it\u2019s a fun read that also reminds you, again, how unique Stephenson is as an author.Closing out the collection are two more non-fiction pieces, including a look at steampunk in pop culture at large by Geek Curmudgeon Rick Claw, and a look at steampunk in the comic book medium by Bill Baker.Unless you like your speculative fiction sans airships and steam engines, check out this excellent Steampunk anthology. In addition to offering a quick-shot education in the history and development of the genre, it also contains some truly excellent short fiction. Recommended.

Now I probably should preface this by saying I have never read any Verne or Wells, so perhaps there were references to past stories and characters of which I was/am unaware.I found \"The Selene Gardening Society\" by Molly Brown delightful. \"The Giving Mouth\" by Ian R. MacLeod was riveting but the end was a thrown-together disappointment. \"Victoria\" by Paul Di Filippo was probably my favourite. \"Reflected Light\" (Rachel E Pollack) was intriging and made me want to read more of her vision of the society she created. \"The Steam Man of the Prairie....\" (Joe R. Lansdale) - I have never read a 'dime novel' but this story made me simultaneously laugh and cringe at the same time ( and because I have seen two versions of \"The Time Machine\", characters were a bit familiar though I don't think Lansdale had to explain so much). Lansdale seems very pleased with his audacity and is laughing along with us. I can picture it!\"Seventy-Two Letters\" by Ted Chiang was another of my favourites. And \"The Sun in the Attic\" by Mary Gentle was another little delight.Although not all the stories would be awarded 4 stars, I'm giving this anthology 4 because I'm truly glad I was exposed to some of these stories and writers.Oh and I topped it off by watching the movie \"Steamboy\" yesterday!

Parte de um romance maior, deslumbra pela vis\u00e3o retro-tecnol\u00f3gica onde a est\u00e9tica mecanicista da primeira revolu\u00e7\u00e3o industrial se alia ao utopismo tecnol\u00f3gico numa narrativa que, como muitas neste g\u00e9nero, vive do conflito militar enquanto fio condutor.Lord Kelvin's Machine: \u00e9 dada a palavra a James Blaylock, um dos fundadores assumidos do g\u00e9nero (ou, pelo menos, um dos que inteligentemente fundiram conceitos est\u00e9ticos soltos no cinema, banda desenhada e fic\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica num sistema coerente). O conto \u00e9 si \u00e9 formulaico e levemente entediante. Cont\u00e9m a est\u00e9tica, remete para aquele ar neo-vitoriano reminiscente de Conan Doyle, Verne e Wells mas a hist\u00f3ria apocal\u00edtpica de dois cientistas arqui-inimigos n\u00e3o convence.The Giving Mouth: uma das caracter\u00edsticas intrigantes desta antologia \u00e9 a forma como as hist\u00f3rias escolhidas raramente se conformam aos pressupostos da est\u00e9tica steampunk. Este conto de Ian R. MacLeod reserva-nos um convincente misto de fantasia e tecnologia num mundo medieval onde a tecnologia \u00e9 indistingu\u00edvel da magia.A Sun in the Attic: no fundo, este conto de Mary Gentle \u00e9 um aglomerado est\u00e9tico de elementos est\u00e9ticos como dirig\u00edveis, indument\u00e1rias de \u00e9poca e iconografia retro-industrial. \u00c9 curioso notar como narrativas de puro steampunk s\u00e3o geralmente f\u00e1ceis de esquecer apesar do enorme esfor\u00e7o dispendido no seu embelezamento. The God-Clown is Near: no conto de Jay Lake a mitologia tradicional do Golem e o futurismo cyberpunk cruzam-se num resgisto surreal.The Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A DIME NOVEL: Joe R. Lansdale surpreende com uma assumida narrativa pulp visceral que mistura descaradamente elementos das edisonades do s\u00e9culo XIX com um h\u00edbrido catastr\u00f3fico de Wells com Stoker. As viagens do tempo do vianjante de The Time Machine de Wells provocam rupturas no tecido do tempo e o viajante acaba por se tornar um vampiro degenerado que solta hordes de morlocks sobre a humanidade indefesa. Apenas os operadores de um gig\u00e2ntico robot movido a vapor parecem ser capazes de travar a amea\u00e7a vamp\u00edrica, mas o colapso inexor\u00e1vel das linhas temporais est\u00e1 a condenar o universo \u00e0 destrui\u00e7\u00e3o final.

D\u00e9cadas ap\u00f3s os acontecimentos da primeira viagem \u00e0 lua, a esposa de um dos exploradores incentiva o regresso \u00e0 aridez lunar porque est\u00e1 farta de ver o marido a dar-lhe cabo das plantas ornamentais. Perante a aus\u00eancia de atmosfera na lua, o plano envolve disparar lixo org\u00e2nico cujo apodrecimento ir\u00e1 criar um solo capaz de suportar vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o produtora de atmosfera. A impossibilidade de lan\u00e7amento destas cargas nos canh\u00f5es lunares \u00e9 resolvida pela inven\u00e7\u00e3o atempada de meios de propuls\u00e3o electromagn\u00e9tica. Um conto firmemente ancorado no c\u00e2none, que se destaca pelo sorriso que provoca.Seventy-Two Letters: com a sua prosa austera e certeira Ted Chiang constr\u00f3i meticulosamente um inventivo mundo neo-vitoriano em que magia e tecnologia convivem. Um criador de golems aut\u00f3matos investiga a possibilidade de criar robots cada vez mais capazes, e v\u00ea-se envolvido no estudo do desenvolvimento dos hom\u00fanculos que habitam no esperma e cujo crescimento uterino gera as novas gera\u00e7\u00f5es.

Obrigatoriamente, conta com dirig\u00edveis e andarilhos mec\u00e2nicos de combate.Victoria: outro toque trans-g\u00e9nero, com o cyberpunk inspirado na gen\u00e9tica de Paul di Filippo inserido numa narrativa de puro steampunk numa era vitoriana onde o progresso tecnol\u00f3gico traz perigosas maravilhas, intrigas palacianas conspiram para derrubar a jovem rainha Vit\u00f3ria e uma salamandra human\u00f3ide faz das del\u00edcias dos homens que com ela se cruzam.Reflected Light: este conto curto de Rachel Pollock coloca-nos no outro lado da imagina\u00e7\u00e3o steampunk, com uma observa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre as classes prolet\u00e1rias que sobrevivem das r\u00e9steas tecnol\u00f3gicas de um mundo brilhante para o qual trabalham arduamente mas que raramente vislumbram.Minutes of the Last Meeting: o conto de Stepan Chapman ganha o pr\u00e9mio de narrativa mais insana da colect\u00e2nea. Na R\u00fassia czarista retro-futurista de 1917 as mais mirabolantes inven\u00e7\u00f5es da tecnologia a vapor coexistem com nanotecnologia consciente. Todo o pa\u00eds \u00e9 vigiado por um c\u00e9rebro electr\u00f3nico avan\u00e7ado que atrav\u00e9s de min\u00fasculos robots omnipresentes vigia tudo e todos mas que gra\u00e7as a uma intriga bizantina \u00e9 levado \u00e0 depress\u00e3o e ignora pequenos ind\u00edcios do que se vem a tornar um atentado em que rebeldes socialistas conseguem assassinar o czar. Nos estertores da morte o czar ordena o lan\u00e7amento do seu maior s\u00edmbolo de poder: uma ogiva at\u00f3mica lan\u00e7ada por um m\u00edssil semi-consciente que pede desculpa porque a igni\u00e7\u00e3o dos seus motores carboniza quem estiver por perto. A explos\u00e3o at\u00f3mica provoca uma temida reac\u00e7\u00e3o em cadeia em que o hidrog\u00e9nio e oxig\u00e9nio na atmosfera se incendeiam, reduzindo o planeta a uma bola de cinzas. Contado com um ritmo impec\u00e1vel em diferentes pontos de vista e um aceno est\u00e9tico muito profundo \u00e0 belle \u00e9poque.Excerpt from the Third and Last Volume of Tribes of the Pacific Coast: cabe a Neal Stephenson encerrar a antologia com um conto que apesar de distante do estilismo steampunk partilha de alguns elementos do g\u00e9nero. Num futuro p\u00f3s-apocal\u00edptico, algumas na\u00e7\u00f5es tradicionais unem-se para proteger o acesso \u00e0 quase miraculosa nano-tecnologia. Exploradores das tribos semi-selvagens que herdaram o que foi o antigo territ\u00f3rio dos Estados Unidos s\u00e3o capturados por uma alian\u00e7a de tribos libert\u00e1rias que deseja capturar os segredos da nano-tecnologia e libert\u00e1-los para todos. Nanotecnologia e apocalipses singularit\u00e1rios t\u00eam pouco a ver com steampunk, mas Stephenson vai buscar as r\u00edgidas estruturas sociais e a venera\u00e7\u00e3o por sistemas pol\u00edticos mon\u00e1rquicos que caracteriza o g\u00e9nero.Jess Nevins abre os ensaios da colect\u00e2nea com uma erudita reflex\u00e3o sobre as ra\u00edzes do g\u00e9nero nas narrativas pulp do s\u00e9culo XIX. Vai mais longe do que o esperado, deixando de lado as \u00f3bvias influ\u00eancias de Wells, Verne e Conan Doyle para olhar para g\u00e9neros esquecidos como a aventura juvenil tecnol\u00f3gica, as edisonades, o western e as narrativas onde a civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o ocidental \u00e9 amea\u00e7ada por perigos orientalistas.

Well, it\u2019s a sub-genre of science-fiction and fantasy that is totally awesome. Imagine Victorian era elegance and modern technology with a dash of rebellion, mashed together into crazy tales about steam-driven robots, dirigibles, insane inventors, and lots of well-mannered chaps in waistcoats living in an alternate history Earth\u2014or maybe not Earth . . .Steampunk is also a modern fashion movement with tons of devotees who wear corsets, brass goggles, Victorian era-looking dresses, waistcoats, and lots of other elegantly fabulous items.The movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is steampunk, and the Hellboy movies have a steampunk feel to them as well.Honestly, I had little clue what steampunk was until very recently. I was asked to write a steampunk story for an upcoming DAW Books anthology called, Steampunked. My deadline is February 1, 2010. I\u2019ve been doing research for a couple of months now, and am going to begin the story today\u2014after I write this review.The anthology edited by Ann and Jeff Vandermeer is a great place to begin reading about steampunk. The introduction and essay at the end give excellent information about the genre, and the stories are awesome. Here are some of my favorite stories in the anthology:*****Preface: Steampunk: \u201cIt\u2019s a Clockwork Universe, Victoria\u201d by Ann and Jeff Vandermeer. What a great intro to the genre and the book. The introduction that follows by Jess Nevins is excellent and will ground any reader in what steampunk is now, and what it was in the past.*****Introduction: The 19th Century Roots of Steampunk by Jess Nevins. This is a non-fiction essay that goes over a ton of the seminal works and gives a history of the genre. Essential reading.****Benediction: Excerpt from The Warlord of the Air by Michael Moorcock. What a cool story from a grandmaster in the field. The story is short and impactful and describes how a war might unfold in an alternate history Earth. Very enjoyable and a perfect place to begin the anthology.***Lord Kelvin\u2019s Machine by James P. Blaylock. This story epitomizes the genre and the author tells a story about a mad inventor and men trying to stop him. I found the style distant, but it was very interesting to read and captured the Victorian era feel.*****The Giving Mouth by Ian R. MacLeod. This author has won the World Fantasy Award and this is my favorite story in the anthology. The style and the utter coolness of the strange world is breathtaking. I had to read it in one sitting and you can see right from the start that this author is a master of this craft. In my opinion, The Giving Mouth is the most powerful narrative in the entire book. Here\u2019s the first few lines of The Giving Mouth:I was a child before I was your king. And even though the redbrick tower where I lived with my parents had many windows that gazed over the Pits, I was raised in what you think of as poverty. Each morning I woke on my pallet of stale straw to the scream of the shift whistle and the clang of the pit wheels. The sound was as familiar to me as birdsong, but the shock of grey light and mineral stench always came like a physical blow. Put simply, I was a dreamer.I need to read more stories and novels by Ian R. Macleod.*****The God-Clown is Near by Jay Lake. What a crazy and madly entertaining story. Jay Lake is one of the most prolific and interesting writers living today. This story was extremely disconcerting and I loved every word. This is one of his Dark Town stories and I\u2019m excited to read more of them.***Seventy-Two Letters by Ted Chiang. World Fantasy Award winning author Ted Chiang has done it all in the short story markets, and is a master of the craft. He is a fascinating writer and this story was shockingly deep, written about an obtuse subject that kept me guessing regarding what was going to happen at the end. It was amazing that my interest was kept up through most of the story. The idea of making inanimate objects live by putting special names on them is cool, but overall, this one was a bit too long for my tastes. The story is a literary achievement with a cool character in a situation I\u2019ve never imagined before, but it suffered from being too long and a little too hard to understand.*****The Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A Dime Novel by Joe R. Lansdale. What an awesome story! This is in my top two in the antho. This tale pays homage from the old dime novel steampunk canon and makes it something fresh and new. You won\u2019t see what\u2019s coming, trust me. The Dark Rider is not who you expect. Oh my god is all I can say. Read this one for sure and it is not for the faint of heart. Though I\u2019ve never met him, Joe R. Lansdale is a sick and twisted bastard, which makes him an awesome writer.****The Martian Agent, A Planetary Romance by Michael Chabon. Pulitzer Prize winning author Michael Chabon\u2019s story is not to be missed. He had me right from the start and I thoroughly enjoyed this alternate history tale about rebellion in an America that has never quite shrugged off the British Empire. The story is about the sons of a rebel leader and that is all I should say on the subject. Read it for sure.*****Victoria by Paul Di Filippo is in my top three of the anthology. I saved this one for last and it was worth it. The story is big and pulls you in right from the start. The characters are well done and I had no idea where it was all going. In my opinion, this story epitomizes \u201csteam,\u201d and especially \u201cpunk.\u201d There is a rebellion here on the highest levels and this story takes you to places that are extremely uncomfortable. I don\u2019t want to ruin anything, so no spoilers here.*****Minutes of the Last Meeting by Stepan Chapman. An alternate history tale about Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia. I loved this story. It sucked me in and the ideas are amazing. Nanotechnology, massive mechanized cavalry, steam driven computer minds, and much more make this one of the most imaginative stories in the antho.There are several more stories in the book that I haven\u2019t reviewed. Maybe you\u2019ll find them to be even better than the ones I described? This is one of those anthologies that has taken some of the best and brightest writers in the field and packaged them up in a must read book.

Some of the stories fit neatly into the clockwork-machines-with-Victorian-manners archetype, but many stray from that, expanding what \"steampunk\" defines itself as. In any case, it's good stuff.Warlord Of The Air - forgettable. I hear that the full novel is pretty good?Lord Kelvin's Machine - The concept was okay, but too much of it was crammed into too few pages. This seemed very pure steampunk: some sort of industrial-revolution-badassery widget to accomplish some goal.The Giving Mouth - Fascinating. While not heavy on the steam or the punk, aside fron allutions to \"liveiron,\" this created a very interesting world wrapping around a mesmerizing narrative. I'm still not sure what the subtext really is, I'd have to read it again, but the dreariness is so apparent, that when the resolution spews forth, it hammers home succinctly. This story is one of the best of the set.A Sun In The Attic - I liked the world that was conjured up here, and I'd be interested to read more about that. The story was ok, another brief one, but the world itself is 100% steampunk, only this time matriarchial arche-feminist, which the author works nicely.The God-Clown Is Near - Vignette, but I do enjoy it when authors create new natural sciences in worlds similar to ours. The idea here, about biological creations not unlike designing and creating a clock from metal scraps, was cool to read about. No idea what the God-Clown actually meant, but I'm not sure that the end result was the real focus.The Steam Man Of The Prairie And The Dark Rider Get Down - When the editors say \"not for the squeamish,\" they should have included \"or anyone who wants to read some rather sick stuff.\" I liked the short-story idea, but the author must have just come off of a marathon set of grindhouse snuff-films, because some of it was just over the top. There was a little need for how gross some of the descriptions were, or what the Dark Rider does and how. I mean, honestly, none of it advanced the plot to a measurable degree. It really ruined the story. Maybe that was the point?The Selene Gardening Society - Great dialogue, so-so story.Seventy-Two Letters - Loved it. Another narrative where a new natural science is created, in this case a nigh-theological lexical natural science, which was very cool. The author takes the new science, that a specific set of letters, imparting a name, can impart character to an inanimate object, to many steps ahead: social implications, theological implications, and even philosophical ones. The author writes as though the science, nomenclature, is matter-of-fact and that the reader takes it at face value, which I like. Not only did this get into the science of it (steam), but also very much into debate over the uses (punk). One of the best of the bunch.The Martian Agent - Skipped it. Read the first page, lost interest.Victoria - Read the first 10 pages, skipped it.Reflected Light - Well written, but a true vignette: brief, nothing really happened, and no resolution to the one point of interest in the last few sentences. Strange to include this piece.Minutes Of The Last Meeting - Interesting, the IIE system reminds me some of the Eagle Eye in the eponymous movie, more or less. This falls heavily into the nano-steam-punk genre.Excerpt Of The Third And Last Volume Of Tribes Of The Pacific Coast - Neal Stephenson, Yes! Great way to cap off the anthology, even though this one is brief. It follows in the same universe as The Diamond Age (which is a future-post-cyber-nano-steam-punk), although taking place some time later than the events of Diamond Age. Colonel Napier and PhyrePhox both make appearances, though, which is of note. This may be one of the Top Three of the set, although I am heavily biased."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1026477-joyce", "userReview": "Unbeknownst to myself, I am a longtime steampunk fan. The Wild, Wild West and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. were favorite TV shows of mine and my son Peter introduced me to anime and Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky and Spirited Away which, according to an essay by Rick Klaw in Steampunk a short story anthology edited by Ann & Jeff Vandermeer, are all variations of the steampunk genre.  If readers have never heard the term \"steampunk,\" as I hadn't until recently, steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that either features settings based in the Victorian era or uses 19th century steam technology in stories that range from medieval times to the 22nd century. This definition includes a broad variety of fiction such as fantasy, space, cyber, romance, historical et al. The fathers of steampunk, Jules Verne and H.G. Welles, would be surprised and undoubtedly thrilled to know the longstanding influence of their characters and stories-that they not only survived the 20th century but also continue to thrive at the end of the first decade of the 21st. This collection includes stories by the most prominent practitioners of steampunk, authors such as Michael Moorcock and James P. Blaylock and includes a story by Neal Stephenson, whose novels are particular favorites of mine. There is a story about what happened to Welles' time traveller in \"The Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A Dime Novel\" by Joe R. Lansadale, which was not one of my favorites but made an indelible impression. Molly Brown's story \"The Selene Gardening Society\" brings back Verne's Michael Ardan a character based on Verne's close friend and fellow lighter than air fanatic, the photographer Nadar (Gaspar-Felix Tournachon, 1820-1910). The humorous tale features a turn of the century ladies' club in Baltimore and their quest to resolve a dispute and thus get a husband back to work and out of his wife's garden. Running the gamut from odious and regpugnant (Dark Rider) to laugh out loud funny, \"Victoria\" by Paul DiFilippo, in which young Queen Victoria is replaced by a salamander, the stories keep the reader's attention. \"The Giving Mouth\" by Ian R. MacLeod, with its medieval setting is particularly memorable. 'The Martian Agent, A Planetary Romance\" by Michael Chabon is surprisingly pedestrian. \"A Sun in the Attic\" by Mary Gentle is a good example of stories that take place in an extraterrestrial environment while others create an alternative history or alternative biological system on our planet.  Even if you don't think of yourself as a sci-fi fan, reading the essays by Jess Nevins, Rick Klaw and Bill Baker about the history and influence of steampunk may disabuse of that belief. Now that we've learned the language, we should be able to recognize steampunk. I wager that if you like the new Sherlock Holmes movie, you'll like steampunk."}, {"userName": "Elise", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1805316-elise", "userReview": "Not bad for a collection of Steampunk short stories and other excerpts and a couple of surveys. It's only fitting that the latter came at the end, more as recommendations of further reading than anything else.I think I've come to realize Steampunk is a genre that is much more broad than I once thought. A couple of these stories seem to fall more along the lines of the New Weird territory, which probably has everything to do with Jeff Vandermeer being co-editor. His picks for Steampunk show that, and they probably wouldn't be my first choice to demonstrate the genre, especially to a newbie. Then again his wife Ann Vandermeer was probably involved in the choices too, but I don't know how much.The collection starts off well in the beginning, muddles off in the middle, and comes to a more stronger close, like the beginning. That is usually par the course for these anthologies. I've never read one short story collection which I thought was amazing. Here are the stories I feel like making a comment on (so not all of them) Good and bad, or stood out in some way:Excerpt from The Warlord of Air by Michael Moorcock - Just a short excerpt, but it was good for what it was.Lord Kelvin's Machine by James P. Blaylock - A fun caper storyThe Giving Mouth by Ian R. MacLeod - Weirdly bizarre, but well writtenThe Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A Dime Novel by Joe R. Landsdale - I probably never thought I would say this, but I thought it was likely the best of the collection. At least the one that made the strongest impression on me. I'm not a fan of torture porn at all, and this story was really grotesque and sadistic. They weren't kidding when they put a warning blurb first for the squeamish. But it's an interesting take on The Time Machine and the Traveler, and how he devolved into this Vlad the Impaler type of persona. I just really wanted to see how it would end and how the characters would escape their situation.The Selene Gardening Society by Molly Brown - Humorous tale about an attempt to create an atmosphere on the moonSeventy-Two Letters by Ted Chiang - Complex and technical stuff about nomenclature. It was dull and I ended up skipping this one.Reflected Light by Rachel E. Pollock - Enjoyed the voice of the narrative, but it was too short.Minutes of the Last Meeting by Stepan Chapman - An alternate history story about the Russian Tsars. It's full of spies, espionage, and nanotechnology and cultural mythos.
