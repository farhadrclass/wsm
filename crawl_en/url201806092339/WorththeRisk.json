I revel in her naughty irreverent humor and amusing observations. The characters engage in amusing and creatively filthy banter and name calling that I\u2019ve never heard before. I had a harder time appreciating the character of Kalista as she was initially prickly, cold, snobbish, over-indulged, and had a hair-trigger temper with a tendency for over-reaction. But my favorite of this story was the feisty pixie known as Ellie, she intrigued me and I\u2019m hoping Ms. Heller will be indulging us with her story soon."}, {"userName": "Rachel Roy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15254037-rachel-roy", "userReview": "This was an amazing book. I was sucked in from the first page. If you don't have the time to finish what you start, beware this book will trap you in it's pages for just that. I literally could NOT put it down.

From beginning to end I couldn't put it down. Fast paced, full of suspense, naughty, highly emotional and all things cheeky, Worth The Risk is a read that I was honored to read. The characters in this novel are nothing short of amazing. Abe and Kalista are simply explosive, but also be on the look out for Zak and Ellie, Michael and Will, Daniel and Alec just to name a few. These guys will have you completely hooked.A absolute brilliant way to start a new year, with a new series by the amazing JB.Absolute perfection.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Misty Warner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21851919-misty-warner", "userReview": "I voluntarily read and reviewed an ARC of this book.

Worth The Risk is the latest book from JB Heller, and I think it\u2019s her best yet. Abe is the epitome of tall, dark and handsome with a side of badass, and then Kalista catches his attention at his brother\u2019s wedding. Kalista is beautiful, passionate and has an incredible strength even when faced with terrors that no one deserves to endure. This story has everything you could ask for - fantastic characters, a kickass storyline, hot, steamy scenes. I seriously loved this story, it held me captive from the very beginning and didn\u2019t release its hold until the final words. A definite must read of 2018."}, {"userName": "Kathleen Matthys", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68670694-kathleen-matthys", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book! Abe is sexy overall and I loved his sweet side that came out when with Kally. I could picture Kally in my head; a strong and aloof society girl. I loved that they turned to mush around each other.

I can see lots of potential with the rest of Abe's team and Kally's brother, Michael."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Richey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44268169-jennifer-richey", "userReview": "Wow this book had me hooked this girl named Kalista hooks up with Abe at a wedding for one night but what happens when her father has to hire him to protect her as her body guard!

I have seen her blurbs and read the reviews but had no idea what I was in for until I started. This book was all of it. Your emotions are tried and true by each of the characters and these two take the cake. They were never supposed to see each other again. But this is more than a love story there is action and intrigue and a massive web of deceit and lies it's crazy. I loved every bit of it and plan on continuing with this author who I am enjoying for the first time."}, {"userName": "Ebbie ~Author Groupies", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27113122-ebbie-author-groupies", "userReview": "4.5 StarsWorth the Risk is an amazing start to Ms Heller\u2019s new series.
