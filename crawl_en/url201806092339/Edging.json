That's what you call it when you take a dose of Intenze. First, you'll experience your mind's own little horror movie. You'll be scared, maybe even terrified, but afterward? You'll get an adrenaline rush like nothing you've ever experienced before. It's a great premise for what turned out to be a great story! All of the characters in this book are well drawn, with realistic problems, hopes and dreams. The main protagonist Rick, is the father of creepy twins and husband to a cheating wife. He's a bit wishy-washy and slow to act on things until his his hand is forced. His wife Trish is unhappy and all too willing to try Intenze at the behest of her new hunk of a boyfriend, Steve. She soon becomes addicted and so do most of the other people who decide to EDGE. But what happens if you do too much? Will you overdose? What is up with the tall, dark, shadowy man that many who EDGE see while they're tripping? What would happen if the whole town was EDGING? You'll have to read it to find out!This is an intricately plotted story and I loved seeing how everything slowly came together. In some ways it reminded me of Salem's Lot. We're introduced to people around town and get some insight into their daily lives. Once events ratcheted up, everything came together beautifully. I do think a few portions dragged just a bit around the 75% mark, but that didn't bother me too much, as I was so engaged with the characters I had to see what happened next.There is an element of originality here with the introduction of Intenze, what it did, and how it was used. There are aspects of this tale that touched on why drug use is so popular, and also on bullies and what motivates them, as well as the acceptance, (or lack thereof) of homosexuality in our homes and in our schools. It is often easy to forget how horrible life can be when one is constantly reminded of, and being made to pay for, being \"different.\" This book takes a hard look at some of those things and I respected and appreciated those bold looks. EDGING was a nice surprise for me. I'm not sure what I expected, but it wasn't a book this compelling. It was well written, had engaging and interesting characters, an original premise and an exciting denouement. What more could you ask for?Highly recommended for fans of dark, edgy, (see what I did there?!) fiction!

With enrich characters and an interesting and thought provoking plot that carries the reader to its ultimate conclusion. The novel raises a lot of questions concerning the drug culture and examines it in a way that pursues readers to examining the current society that we live in. The characters have their own flaws which are very common place in the realistic realm for which they exist. Schultz has enabled the reader to pursue this world and explore the current problems within the American subculture.In fact, Americans are more likely to try illegal drugs than anyone else in the world. For instance, 42% of Americans have tried Marijuana compared to the 20% of Dutch people despite the Netherlands\u2019 long-running policy of tolerating sales and possession without criminal penalties. America also rates as number one in Cocaine use beating out Columbia where the drug is normally manufactured.Ever wonder why marijuana is illegal but alcohol and tobacco are legal? It has nothing to do with the relative risks of the drugs\u200a\u2014\u200aboth legal drugs kill and addict larger proportions of their users than the illegal one does.So why was marijuana prohibition retained while alcohol prohibition was ended? And why, for that matter, are heroin, MDMA, cocaine, and LSD illegal? Drugs are made illegal based on who is perceived to take them and on racial politics\u200a\u2014\u200ascience is rarely considered in these decisions.If a drug\u2019s perceived primary users are not white, the drug tends to be banned\u200a\u2014\u200aand stay that way. The U.S. and Europe have legalized their own preferred drugs and banned those of all other nations\u200a\u2014\u200aand those perceived as \u201ccorrupters of youth\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200afor the past century.These are very interesting statistics and this is the realm in which Michael Schutz\u2019s excellent novel sits. Looking at this world, the book addresses on what would happen if the new high becomes highly addictive but offers something that no drug has offered in the past. The main consequences when the drug has extreme side effects and how a person deals with the general fallout that occurs within their family and community.The novel works on multi-levels and at the same time, the thrill ride that is produced is like no other with its fast pacing and intriguing plots. The characters are so well drawn that you are able to comprehend and feel through their enriched texturized written prose. The imagery is vivid and visceral and sets in the subconscious long after you put the book away.The novel works within many genre concepts including action, thriller, sci-fi and horror and finding home in the dark fiction category but doesn\u2019t rest on any of the concepts found in your run of the mill genre findings. Schutz\u2019s is a highly gifted writer and this novel should set his career to the next level.Enriched and engaging characters, fast pacing and topical plotlines and a novel that speaks for today within its highly original story. This is a definite must read for people who are looking for something to totally immerse themselves with. This is thought provoking, horrifying, gripping, action packed thrill ride for 2017. This has hit every mark and makes the reader want more. The only gripe I could find is I wanted more. Excellent novel and a definite must read."}, {"userName": "Kerry Denney", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28669783-kerry-denney", "userReview": "Strap yourself in for a wild, terror-filled ride rife with mayhem and madness! Reminiscent of several of the greatest moments of classic horror yet shining with a distinct style and brand all its own, EDGING is intense, creepy, freaky, trippy, unique, mind-blowing, and stupefyingly brilliant. Schutz captures the true horror of \"things that go bump in the night\" masterfully. He paints his scenes with vivid, visceral, and unforgettable imagery. If you\u2019re a horror fanatic looking for something new under the sun (or lurking in the shadows!), look no further. EDGING is that good, a macabre work of art worthy of a standing ovation. This story makes Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, and Freddy Krueger look like Mister Rogers, Barney the Dinosaur, and the Pillsbury Doughboy. I\u2019m a finicky and brutally critical reader, and I\u2019m happy to give EDGING my highest recommendation. I couldn\u2019t put this book down. I\u2019ll be pushing my way to the front of the line to get my grubby hands on anything this author writes. A top-of-the-list must-read for all horror fans.

This was a different and unique horror book and I loved every minute of it.

Just how much would you risk to take that thrill-ride? \u201cEdging\u201d written by Michael Schultz explores these intriguing queries \u2013 by grabbing the reader by the scruff of the neck and exposing a very strange horror-filled reality, bordering on twilight-zone, and then metamorphoses into an all-too raw human experience!Here is just a scary sip of the author\u2019s Electric Kool-Aid:\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t edge alone your first time.\u201d Kenny thrummed his fingers on the arm of the couch. \u201cBut it\u2019s your trip.\u201d Steven stood and walked Kenny to the door. \u201cThanks for coming over.\u201d He tucked the pill in his pocket and clapped his neighbor on the back. After closing and locking the door, Steven returned to the couch. He fished the Intenze out of his pocket and set on the coffee table. \u201cIntense, indeed.\u201d Steven popped the former aspirin into his mouth and swigged it down with Gatorade. He sat back and waited for his edge to start. He didn\u2019t wait long. His living room grew dim as if a spotlight receded. Dimmer still until he sat swaddled in gloom. His thoughts fractured and scattered. What am I doing? What\u2019s happening? He blinked and tried to orient himself. Shadow shapes roiled in the corners of his apartment. A clattering burst from the bookcases on either side of the archway to the bathroom and bedroom... Steven stood on wobbly legs. Calm down. Kenny said this would happen. As soon as the thought registered, it tore apart like cotton batting. The air felt electric; all the soft hairs on his arms stood up\u2026 A tangible paranoia pressed its weight onto the back of his neck. A form leaped from the corner. Startled, Steven tripped backward. Trying not to shriek, he bit his lower lip hard enough to draw blood but recovered his balance before he could tip over onto the couch. He straightened his track jacket and shook his head to clear his thoughts. The image vanished, but he still heard its heavy, steady breath. He stepped toward the bedroom, his knees practically knocking together. Shadows nipped with cold teeth at his ankles. He glanced over his shoulder. No one behind him. With his heart hampering, a single icy bead of sweat traced a slow line from his armpit to his waist. The chill at his back pushed him toward the unknown presence ahead. He crossed the threshold into his bedroom. A thick black smoke wrapped around him. The air throbbed. A few feet away, jaundiced eyes gleamed in the dark, and a figure emerged from the gloom. Phantom arms reached for him. He screamed.\u201dThis is my first time reading a novel by this author, so I possessed no preconceived notions, went into this with an open mind and an open heart. YIKES! Was I Scared!The pace was exhilarating, each character had their own sub-plot which was masterly weaved together with shakiness, aggression, horror, daily human existence, and the primal passion of each very well-developed character was intense.

Starting the book completely blind, and knowing nothing of the author, I was instantly dragged into the crazy story of a new designer drug, Intenze, which is so powerful and hallucinogenic it is compared to riding the scariest rollercoaster and watching the most intense horror film both at the same time. Or perhaps comparing it to your own worst nightmare is a better idea? Author Jason White said this in his preview blurb: \u201cIf Jim Thompson and William S Burroughs were to collaborate on a novel about dark psychedelic drugs, murder, and the supernatural, this would be the result.\u201d When I read that quote I thought \u201cYeah right, that\u2019s an overreaction if ever I heard one.\u201d But in actual fact Jason hits the nail on the head. The drug Intenze offers a very short high intensity experience which is referred to as edging and the plot explores how this very addictive drug spreads its deadly web through the sleepy town of New London. The reader drift in and out of the lives of multiple characters, from how they discover the drug initially, to the horrors of where it eventually takes them. Like all drugs if effects different characters in varying ways but there are common traits, with all users suffering from crippling fear and paranoia. Taking Intenze leads to quick addiction and the author graphically shows where those who overdo edging end up. Bearing in mind a single hit does not even last one minute, you will need serious cash to support this habit (a fact the dealers are well aware of). Schutz fires off some obvious warning shots about the dangers of drugs, but never patronises, and as more and more of the town fall under the influence of Intenze everything descends into chaos. Seen through multiple points of view, not all who are taking the drug, the plot has some clever spins to it.Let\u2019s not forget this is a horror novel and for some a drug that turns users into paranoid psychopaths might be enough for a major plotline, but not Michael Schutz, as there is also a tremendous supernatural angle to the novel. The fear created by so many people constantly edging causes an out-of-this-world bodiless entity known as The Thirst to turn his evil eye on New London, sensing weakened new prey to feast upon. The demon thrives on terror and gets more and more powerful when havoc runs riot, especially if his presence exacerbates their fear. The Thirst is a great character and quickly starts stalking the new addicts of New London who really have enough problems of their own without a bogeyman sneaking into their peripheral vision.The characterisation made this novel a real standout. Schutz had the impressive ability of quickly sketching out believable back stories and I found myself really liking many of the characters and how they went about their daily lives. This was crucial to the success of the novel as the paranoia brought on by edging was in stark contrast to the normal lives the characters previously led. My favourite was the family that had a pivotal role to the story; Trish and Rick are having marriage problems but will not talk about it, they also have young twins Tammy and Tim. When Trish starts to edge the fragile family dynamics take a major hit and The Thirst moves in. This is powerfully written stuff and the twins are superb little characters.The twins cleverly spill into another storyline, Miss Renee Parker is their kindergarden teacher and for a reason she just cannot fathom does not like the twins. So imagine the possibilities if the teacher mistakenly takes the drug after her boyfriend hides it in her drugs cabinets and her paranoia is ramped up when she is in the school classroom? There are many other entertaining story strands, including those set in the local high school, the old folks home and the drug dealers themselves. Many of these plotlines cleverly cross paths and when The Thirst is thrown into the mix the end result is an energetic and highly readable horror thriller. I\u2019m very happy to give Michael Schutz\u2019s latest novel Edging a five star review and I am sure there are many horror readers out there that will be highly entertained by this original and quirky page turner."}, {"userName": "Robin Goodfellow", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67804103-robin-goodfellow", "userReview": "-I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.Edging, by Michael Schutz, is an illusory horror that decimates sweet dreams adults used to try to believe in.Trish is a young woman who feels trapped in a loveless marriage. Miss Parker is an elementary school teacher who can\u2019t stand her students, specifically a pair of twins who keep to themselves. Josh is a gay high school student who struggles with a one-sided relationship. Although they all live separate lives, they use the drug, Intenze, which produces a powerful hallucination that allows them to live their fears. But as they confront these fears, a mysterious figure waits in the background, feasting on these fears with a cannibalistic passion. I loved reading about each character. While I couldn\u2019t really sympathize with some of them, such as Trish or Miss Parker, I did enjoy reading about Rick and Josh. But despite my preferences, each character had a struggle they could have conquered, conflicts they could have solved if not for that drug, which brings out people\u2019s demons and literally scares them to death. However they got the drug, in the end they are still affected. The style reminded me of Maberry\u2019s Dead of Night series. The infection spreads so easily, so much so they degraded an entire town in a matter of hours. The same can be said for Intenze, but instead of a plague, it\u2019s a set of pills that have degraded the town\u2019s sanity. My most favorite part was reading about those creepy twins, Tim and Tammy. They care about their parents and each other, even though they were considered by almost everyone. It was them that the Boogeyman seemed to value the most, because children\u2019s fears were usually the most potent. Despite me cheering them in, it was still disturbing how they dealt with the situation. This concept is what leads my fascination with the mysterious figure. It feeds off everyone\u2019s fears, so much so that Schultz even described it as \u201cThe Boogeyman.\u201d It was frightening to me, how accurate this was. I loved how gluttonous it seems, devouring its victims with a frightening efficiency. It was this thing that drove people to commit such heinous acts against their loved ones, as well as complete strangers. It was so interesting to read about this creature, watching it control everyone from the shadows, like a dark puppet master pulling the chains of his puppets. It brings me to the idea of fear throughout the book. The Boogeyman was right about one thing; fear is the most purest of human emotions. It\u2019s what drives us either to survive or to cower in fear. It\u2019s also the thing that the horror genre has utilized for centuries. It\u2019s a marvelous thing that can entertain us, scare us, or drive us into the deepest pits of despair.Because of this, I would give this book a rating of a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Fear is a huge part of this book, revolving around both its characters and its plot. Each aspect was frightening in its own way, even without The Boogeyman watching them. As such, I would recommend this book to fans of the Insidious film series, alongside any psychologist looking for a good scare."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3369578-andrew", "userReview": "A new designer drug, Intenze, is on the market. The experience of taking it is called Edging. Unlike any other drugs, Edging gives you a brief but terrifying reality-bending experience, along with an adrenaline rush that can\u2019t be beaten. Taking Intenze is like a watching a horror film while riding a roller coaster. It\u2019s also highly addictive.There is more to the drug though. The fear it induces opens a doorway for a dark creature, known as The Thirst, to worm its way into the world. The darkness that is The Thirst manipulates an addict to spread Intenze across the small town of New London to all of the unsuspecting public.The members of the town are a varied bunch and we get to know them before the whole place starts going to hell. I liked the natural way the different members of the community cross paths. It gives it a sense of place. There are a variety of ages as well as gay characters, so it\u2019s not the old trope of bland teens. You do care what happens to them. It makes the insidious spread of Edging even more tense and impactful.It was interesting to learn about the townspeople\u2019s deep seated neuroses, nightmares, and traumatic childhood experiences that The Thirst manipulated and fed on. As the fear and nightmares spread, The Thirst gains strength and is able to take a tangible form.The major focus of the book is on one family. Our protagonist is Rick, a devoted father, who works at an elderly care facility. Intenze comes into his life as his already distant and cheating wife, Trish, gets introduced to the drug by her lover, Steven.Rick and Trish have twins, Timmy and Tammy. They are creepy, with a Village of the Damned vibe, even when interacting with their mother. They have a closeness and an almost telepathic understanding between them. The twins share an obsession with taking apart LEGO people to \u201cfix\u201d them. They have special gifts, but we are never told why. This was frustrating, as they play an integral role.This book offers plenty of nightmarish scares and riffs on Slenderman a good bit. The Thirst is an interesting and powerful villain of the piece. Nightmare hallucinations are a fertile ground for invention and the author uses that well. There is gore and plenty of violence, so the terror is not all just in people\u2019s heads. There was the potential for humor to drop in with the Freddy Krueger-like nightmare visions, but it doesn\u2019t. The book remains dark and serious, and is all the better for it. It does leave a few questions unanswered, which was a small disappointment. Edging is an enjoyable read and I recommend checking this out."}, {"userName": "Linda Watkins", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19287077-linda-watkins", "userReview": "This was one terrific read that, like most classic horror, blends the terrors that exist in real-life with supernatural ones.The story revolves around the Carlson family: Rick, Trish, and the twins, Tammy and Tim.

Murder stalks the streets of this once law-abiding town. While this novel is a work of fantasy, I think it has great relevance today, given the drug culture that plagues us. Legal highs especially are turning ordinary people into raving lunatics who are slaves to their addiction. I felt that Mr Schutz described this slide into madness and dependency really well. There is a delicious sense of unease throughout the book and a rich array of characters. The evil entity that preys on them all is beyond creepy! I was seeing scenes in my mind as I was reading and thinking how scary they would be if this book was made into a movie!
