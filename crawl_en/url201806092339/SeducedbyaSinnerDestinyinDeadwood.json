The ending was fitting and a really good one. However I am sad to have this series end. I have grown close to the Anderson brothers and the women in their lives. Even though I have only read books two and three. I have to go back and read book one, Redeemed by a Rebel, which is Jake's story. Yet, if you have not read the first book don't fear as you can jump into this series with no problems. The author does a good job of recapping the prologue. I really enjoyed this book. Whereas, in book two with Liam, his story was more on the sweet side, Zach's story was more on the spicy side. Plus, I loved Lily's daughter, Gemma. She was so cute and not afraid to speak her mind. In this book I found that Zach had matured more which endured me to him even more. I was glad to see him have a happy ending as well. I was seduced by this story. I look forward to reading more books by this author."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Seduced by a Sinner by Cynthia Woolf is a 2014 publication. The Destiny in Deadwood series comes to a close with this third installment. This story will focus on Zach Anderson. After returning home to Deadwood, Zach is more determined than ever to convince Lily to marry him. The trouble is Lily is wary of men after her fiance' ran off when she informed him she was pregnant. Now she doesn't trust men, but when she is robbed of her life savings, she turns to Zach for help. Zach feels sort of like a fifth wheel now that his brothers are married with families of their own. So, he rents a room at Lily's to help her out and to give the newlyweds some privacy. This might also give him some time to show Lily what kind of man he is. However, he is still on the lookout for a dangerous enemy who is out for revenge against the Anderson family. Once more the author tells a fast paced story of the old west with danger, mystery, murder , but also with a sweet and tender love story. Lily is a lady ahead of her time as she fights for independence during a time when women were relegated to marriage, the kitchen, babies, and not much else. Lily runs a store and her business is her lifeline and is what feeds her and Gemma, her young daughter. Zach is an honorable man, but a determined one when it comes to protecting his family, Lily and Gemma. He is kind of funny at times when he gets a little jealous or when he is teasing Lily. The couple have a lot to deal with in their lives, like Measles outbreaks, watching over their shoulders for their sworn enemy, and a few twist here an there you won't see coming. The love story is sweet but there is a little more sensuality in this one which I thought worked great with this particular couple. Zach's love for Gemma was amazing and we know he will be a great father. This series is easy to read, heartwarming, and entertaining. If you enjoy western historical romances then you will most certainly enjoy this series. While this book is a part of a trilogy it can be read as a stand alone. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Rhomy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6897164-rhomy", "userReview": "3.5 starsFirst posted here: http://iknowthatbook.blogspot.com.ar/...This is my fourth book by this author, and I can tell you she never disappoints. Though this one was not my favorite, I really enjoyed it anyway and it was very entertaining.What worked:- The beautiful cover (not only sexy but with lovely colors!)- The pace was fast, the reading was easy and the writing smooth and simple- The romance was sweet- Even if I didn\u2019t really liked Lilly, she was a simple Deadwood girl. She made mistakes, she was confused about what she felt and that\u2019s what made her believable.- The killer\u2019s addition is interesting and had me trying to guess the outcome.- It was nice to read about the other members of the family I\u2019ve grown attached during the series.- Looooved the epilogue.What didn\u2019t work:- I wanted to know more about the villain.- I found that there was not enough depth in characters as in other books by Cynthia W.- I couldn\u2019t connect to Zach and Lilly or their love story. I was expecting a heart-stopping relationship such as in \u201cFiery Bride\u201d (also by C. Woolf) or Redeemed by a Rebel (book 1 in this series). And I didn\u2019t get it here. I felt something was missing. I was expecting that breath-taking moment when you know that couple is meant to be and it never arrived. However, it was sweet and nice.What else?- It is sad to see this lovely family go away.- It is an entertaining series, totally worth reading."}, {"userName": "Linda Walters", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7904897-linda-walters", "userReview": "The story was enjoyable, with the other family members (Anderson's) also being a part; helping each other. Lily's daughter Gemma, was really drawn to Zach; she could tell how much he loved her. There were several enemies at work; I thought there was only one (the serial killer) but it was a surprise to see several other ones come out and be dealt with. I have to admit, there were a few times I thought I had it figured out what was going to happen next. But, I was only right one time; the rest went into a different direction. I'm trying so hard not to give anything away, so that's all I'm going to say about that. Although I found the courtship between Zach and Lily sweet; it also felt like it was kind of missing something. Don't ask me to explain more than that because I'm not sure I can put my finger on it. I always like it when the author puts an epilogue in their books when its needed, and this author did.Nice work on the cover picture of the eBook. \u201cI received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review\u201d."}, {"userName": "Rose Arbor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43736350-rose-arbor", "userReview": "Cynthiana Woolf is one of my favorites. I always like her books. This book is the third one in a series. Even though I own about twenty of Ms Woolf's books, this is the only one I have in this series. But I knew her books read well as stand-alones, so I didn't worry that I would be lost. There is a little confusion about the title. My copy is called \"Zach,\" but it is the same story renamed.Zach Anderson is one of three brothers whose lives have been touched by an evil man who loves to kill. And now, they know he is after them and anyone they love. Zach loves Lily and her daughter Gemma. He and his brothers will do what they need to do, in order to keep their loved ones safe. Zach has an additional problem. Gemma's father wants her and Lily back. Lily is distrustful of all men because of him and Zach has to earn her trust and her love to keep her safe.The story is exciting, yet has a tender love story in it. The characters are likeable and well-drawn. There is action, suspense, villains, and heroes. And a happily ever after. What more could you ask for?"}, {"userName": "Lindsey Gray", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4726831-lindsey-gray", "userReview": "Zach Anderson had no idea what he was getting into when he took the long journey to Deadwood with his brothers to mine a claim for gold. He never expected falling head over heals for Lily Sutter, the town outcast and owner of the only store in town.After his brothers fell in love with their wives in Deadwood, Zach was the only Anderson brother who wasn't attached. He was the only one who could ward off the threat from his former Army commander, Richard Jordan. Zach had chased Jordan after the events in Healed by a Heart. He ended up with a slash across his face and Jordan hiding in Deadwood.During the first two books in the series, I could see how enamored Zach was with Lily and her daughter, Gemma. When I started reading this story, I sighed and thought FINALLY. But no, Lily didn't make it easy on the former Yankee Captain. After numerous proposals and declarations of love, she only gives in for her daughter, not for herself. I seriously felt like smacking her over the head with one of those huge bags of flour from her store. I understood her reluctance after how she was left pregnant and alone by her former fianc\u00e9, but Zach was so dedicated to Lily and Gemma's happiness.The danger level rose in this installment as Richard Jordan weaved through Deadwood in several different disguises. One chapter had me falling more in love with Zach and Lily and the next would have me fearing for their lives. Woolf does not disappoint with the edge of your seat action during the final showdown.The Destiny in Deadwood series ends with a bang as the drama, danger, and romance is amped up to an all time high. There is no way I can pick which story I love the most. I will be reading about the Anderson men over and over until Woolf publishes her next series, The Brides of San Francisco.Thanks to Cynthia Woolf and Black Lion Tours for granting me with a copy of Seduced by a Sinner in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "KyBunnies", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4782771-kybunnies", "userReview": "Originally posted at Bunny's ReviewI have not read the other books in this series but that did not matter with this book. I was swept into Deadwood, swept back to a harder time with a simpler life style.Zach is little obsessed with catching the man who has haunted him and his brothers for several years, a man who finds his thrill when he kills people after brutally abusing them. Zach just wants to live his life with the woman he loves and not worry about looking over his shoulder wondering if harm was around the coroner waiting for those he loves.Lily has been burned once by a man. She is skittish as a new born colt. She does her best to protect her heart from hurt again by not allowing any man to close. When the father of her child shows up in Deadwood she is reading to do anything to protect her daughter.This was a fun fast read. I really enjoyed this book even if I started the last in the series first. Now to go back and read the other two books. I recommend this book to any who enjoy historical romance set in the wild west.The bunnies and I give this book Bunny4_thumb.jpg carrots.I was given this book in exchange for an honest review.

They have dealt with so many issues, from everything to be expected from be a cowboy to murder to dealing with the ex of the woman you love. It just so happens that this ex in also the father of her child. Gemma was my favorite and I would love to read a spin off book about her and she can let us know how her family is doing. I understand why Lily was afraid to love again, however if she doesn't open up her heart then she is going to be alone forever. I am giving this book a 4/5.

Zach is doing his best to convince the lady he has fallen in love with that he means it - but she's a Southern belle transplanted to the harsh life of the West and very distrustful of any man - especially a Yankee!!

Jake sure was persistent in persuing Lily. If I was Jake, I would have given up and moved on. Ending was anti-climatic when they finally brought down Jorden.My biggest complaint about this series is the horrible editing. Many times it seemed large chunks of the plots were simply removed which made the story choppy and often made no sense. Also, there were so many typos, the company who puts out this series should be ashamed for putting out such a lousy product. I'm going to write to them and complain."}, {"userName": "Louiseann Walter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32556481-louiseann-walter", "userReview": "AMAZINGBook three was just as suspenseful as one and two.
