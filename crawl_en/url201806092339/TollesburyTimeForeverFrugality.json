It's an amazing, poetical, whimsical gem of a book. When Simon Anthony falls into a drunken stupor on the salt marshes near his home village of Tollesbury and tries to drown himself he is transported to an earlier, simpler time where he learns some truths about himself and how he wants to live his life. The tale is told as if in a dream or a drug induced trip with lovely lyrical writing and a sprinkling of references to rock music, particularly of the Beatles. There are some lovely scenes involving children reciting stories and poetry as well as a wonderful village cricket match. Hard to say too much more about it without giving the plot away except that it offers an alternative view of mental illness as being just another way of looking at life.\"For there is no schizophrenia and there is no depression; no bi-polar disorder, personality disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. There is just life and trying to get through it. That is all. Look past the drugs and past the diagnosis, look deeper than the despair and higher than the highs - and what you have is a soul that needs embracing, a mind that needs cradling and a heart that needs to beat its beat without condemnation\""}, {"userName": "Margaret (Margot)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12842923-margaret-margot", "userReview": "Amongst the fluff in the Kindle Free section, I ran across this novel. At the time it had 35 or so reviews, none of which were below 3. For me, this rating ratio invites me to read the reviews. I don\u2019t particularly like to read the book descriptions because I like everything to be unknown when a book is started. That being said, I filter reviews for those that discuss why they liked the book rather than those that provide a synopsis of the book. On brief inspection, what I found was intriguing. So alas, I downloaded the book for free (lucky me!). I was aware this book would be a much different reading experience than my more recent downloads, but decided to follow through in hopes of finding a gem at its early stage in review life.This novel is by far, the most incredible book I have read in a very long time. In fact, it may be the best, considering the majority of my classic literature was read as a young adult in college courses and my appreciation level for that reading was nil based on the fact that the literature was assigned rather than chosen. I have yet to revisit them, although I hope to someday. I admit this book took me longer to read than most do. I cherished it. I didn\u2019t want to miss a word. I didn\u2019t want to read too late for fear I may nod off and miss something. I waited for quiet opportunities to concentrate. I didn\u2019t want to just read a page at a time, there was too much to digest because the substance of this book is so much more than just the light reading I have become so familiar with. I highlighted passages like never before. Some witty, some meaningful, some thought provoking, some descriptions I\u2019d like to use myself in the future. I became enamored.In keeping with my distaste for knowing any information regarding the content of the story, upon finishing this book, I wanted to know more about the author and the possibility of any factual detail revolving around the characters in the story. I have refrained up to now but may look into it more after this review. My curiosity wanted to know what lovely brain concocted this story. But the more I reflect, the more I realize it doesn\u2019t matter who wrote the story, just that it was written. What is important is that these words have been collected, regardless of fiction or a combination of reality and fiction. The point is what the story tells. It is absolutely beautiful. It has at least momentarily, while it is still fresh in mind, altered my senses, changed my perceptions and given me hope. Hope for humanity, for what is possible when self-reflection and acceptance are accomplished, to even those beyond the realm of \u201cnormal\u201d. Through this story, this wonderful, poor, terrorized soul finds the strength to accomplish what very few individuals can ever hope to do. Finding peace is a beautiful thing to aspire to, indeed!"}, {"userName": "Anthony Bellaleigh", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5865891-anthony-bellaleigh", "userReview": "Stuart Ayris is, as mentioned elsewhere in reviews for this book, a spectacular poet. I found his use of descriptive language and metaphor entrancing. Honestly, there were times I simply had to stop reading so I could sit back and fully appreciate the beauty of some of the sentences...Here is just a very quick example, lifted completely at random whilst I'm writing this review: \"His face was surely carved from the very earth itself; that mixture of dirt and debris, sand, silt, clay and stone that had congealed and hardened over the centuries to form the crust of our world.\"This is as close to a modern day Thomas Hardy novel as I have read - high praise indeed.So why can't I bring myself to give it 5 stars...??Well, as always, it's a personal thing but here's what I was less enamoured with:- The formatting of the book was distracting for me (unindented with 1.5 line para breaks breaks up the flow too much for my eye). This may sound petty but for a book which screams, \"Quality writing!\" at the top of it's lungs, it needs to look like printed matter on an e-reader.- There was not enough mystery in the first part for me (it was just a little bit too obvious what was going on and who the various characters would turn out to be).- Probably as a result of the above, I felt the book lost content (and, for me, interest) a number of times and particularly through the second and third acts.Don't be put off by my minor gripes. This is a very well written, complex, book which tackles, head-on, an incredibly difficult subject. IMHO it's only an inch or two away from being a modern day classic... Recommended for those who enjoy classics and/or literary fiction."}, {"userName": "Tahlia Newland", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4130800-tahlia-newland", "userReview": "This is an exquisite story about a man diagnosed with schizophrenia who heals himself by paying attention to his hallucinations. Beautifully written and flawlessly edited, it leaves you feeling somewhat purified and decidedly uplifted, not just by the beautiful language but also from the underlying theme that if we trust ourselves, we may find ourself more whole than we thought, or at least find a way to bring about that wholeness.Simon's story exposes society's fear of those with a different kind of perception. He sees the world differently, more poetically, than is the norm. He senses things that others miss, and his hallucinations, rather than random aberrations of the brain, are symbols to help him understanding his world. As he says, if he tells you what he's thinking you will put him in hospital and give him drugs to make him see the world like everyone else. The drugs dull his senses, make it fuzzy around the edges. He understands that his illness has caused him to attempt suicide twice and he understands that he must accept the drugs in order to be considered well, but it is his journey into his own mind, written as if he really did go back in time and meet Walrus and the children, that gives him the key to a happier, healthier life.The characterisation was exemplary, deep and sensitive. I could delve into technical aspects of the story, but to keep it short, I will just say that I could find no fault with this book, and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys deeply moving and inspiring writing"}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13060256-elaine", "userReview": "I read this book a couple of years ago, at a time when everyone seemed to be whispering about this fantastical, lyrical, journey of a read called Tollesbury Time Forever, and there was something in the reverential awe surrounding it that made me realise I just had to jump on that bandwagon. Well, I was stunned and the only thing I can say is that everyone should read this book. When I first read it I can truthfully say that it was the first time I have been seriously moved to tears by a book since i read The Diving Bell and the Butterfly - it is that good a read! It is a very poetic book; the story of the trip that is taken in the mind of the main character Simon during a schizophrenic episode. It sounds quite ludicrous to say that the story portrays mental illness in quite a beautiful way, but it just does, there is no other way to describe it - the writing is sheer poetry and very witty and funny in quite an understated way. I particularly loved a scene, set 200 odd years ago in the past, with a group of characters singing \u201cTollesbury Time Forever\u201d to the tune of \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever\u201d. It will certainly get inside your head and make you reconsider your own feelings towards those suffering from a mental illness, giving you a sense of compassion and understanding towards them. A fantastic book written by a master wordsmith, which really deserves to be read by everyone. In fact, I haven\u2019t stopped whispering about it yet, even now two years on, if someone buys a kIndle I am jumping in, saying \u201cyou MUST read this book!\u201d"}, {"userName": "Nancy Bevilaqua", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13890313-nancy-bevilaqua", "userReview": "I've become reluctant to review books (especially books by living writers) lately, because it occurred to me that for one writer to review another's work is kind of like one parent critiquing another parent's child. In any case, I will not be writing bad reviews of any books; if I don't like something I read I'll just put it aside and forget about it.But a few days ago I happened to read Stuart Ayris' Tollesbury Time Forever, and I was astonished by its beauty, its originality, its playfulness (I especially love the musical references throughout--some obvious, and some on the sly), and its sweetness. I won't try to describe the plot, but a phrase came to me the other night that seemed to be a very good description of what happens in the book--\"x-ray of a dream.\" Without over-thinking it or getting carried away with merely being clever, Ayris manages to get beneath the surface of the dream that we think of as life through his character's inward journey toward making himself whole and well again, when the usual interventions fail him.You've got to expect good things from a writer whose heroes include Kerouac, Bob Dylan, Rick Danko, and Jack Daniels. Just trust me and read the book."}, {"userName": "Marianne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17337147-marianne", "userReview": "This book is just amazing. After reading it you'll never look at mental illness or yourself the same again. Stuart Ayris writes with such eloquence and beauty.

Simon also describes his life between such visits, using the knowledge he gained in the first part of the story, to gain a better understanding of his life and mental health.Simon has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.The story is a wonderful journey of self discovery, displaying enormous compassion and insight by the author.The story is also beautifully written.

This puts \u2018Tollesbury\u2019 in good company indeed, for Hulme\u2019s novel won the 1985 Booker Prize.So re-read \u2018Bone People\u2019 I did, and then Stuart Ayris\u2019s \u2018Tollesbury\u2019 once more, for good measure (it was no chore). And quickly realised the two novels share much more than the same ugly subject matter, albeit in variation. In each, a Simon is a central character. In each, the trespass done him is gradually revealed. In each, the author makes an appearance (in \u2018Bone People\u2019, the main female character is a Kerewin Holmes, in \u2018Tollesbury\u2019, Ayris enters briefly under his own name). In both stories, place is a virtual character and is evocatively written: the readers of \u2018Bone People\u2019 will feel the rough waters and winds of New Zealand\u2019s coast deposit salt on their cheeks, and those of \u2018Tollesbury\u2019 will sniff the mud and brine of Essex\u2019s stiller salt marshes. Pubs feature in both tales, and alcoholic excesses. So does music, with Hulme\u2019s characters making their own and Ayris\u2019s Simon cocking an ear and his soul to it.The most important likenesses centre on tone and spirit. While the two narratives take their readers deep into ugliness, these are emotionally conflicting descents \u2013 good-heartedness and generosity are at at every turn and pause. The reader is compelled to stay the course, and is ultimately rewarded. The resolutions to both stories are uplifting. Four stars for \u2018Tollesbury Time Forever\u2019, reluctantly given, as four and half stars is a more accurate rating. I have forgiven \u2018The Bone People\u2019 for the martial arts episode that appears mid story, and also award it four stars, again in place of four and a half.http://cassianbrownblog.com/"}, {"userName": "Jud", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5830833-jud", "userReview": "Tollesbury Time Forever really sets the scene of an idyllic English village, quaint and romantic. It almost makes you want to move to such a place yourself so in sunny weather or even in light rain you could go for walks to be at one with nature and to ponder the meaning of life. Perhaps with the odd profound thought drifting across your mind from time to time. However, for our main character Simon things do not stay this way, suddenly things are turned on their head.Simon somehow ends up back in the past and meets several suspicious characters whom he appears to trust despite not necessarily liking the person. The reader is taken along with Simon on a terrific journey of confusion, fear and eventually enlightenment. After this point the rest of the story follows Simon\u2019s resolution to turn his life around to follow what he learnt at his \u2018enlightenment\u2019.The book is extremely well written with some beautiful sentences and descriptions, it\u2019s not often I use the highlighting tool on my Kindle but for this book I had to. The concept of the story is also magnificent, I don\u2019t know how closely it follows real life procedures but it seemed very realistic to me.

How happy I am then to say what a remarkable read this is! Simon Anthony has just been to his local pub and has managed to stagger his way to the Tollesbury salt marshes where his intention is to end his life.With the sound of The Beatles whizzing through his head everything stops and he falls head first into a new world where reality has had a big chunk bitten off. He finds himself back in 19th Century Tollesbury where cars have been replaced by horses, the ale is disgusting, his home has disappeared and a strange man knows more about him than he seems to know himself. I have read a few independently published books in the last year or so but this is literally in a league of its own. It is beautifully and imaginatively written and keeps your interest all the way. If I had to describe this book I would personally say it's like 'Life on Mars' meets 'The Prisoner.' There are plenty of story twists and turns and Tollesbury Time Forever will stay with you long after you have read the final page. Stuart Ayris is an author that I'm sure has a big future ahead and I look forward to reading more from him in the future.

It is simultaneously beautiful and devastating, and I found myself reading quite slowly to savor the cadence and wonderful character descriptions. In an era where simpler-is-better sells, Ayris' style is a Monet hanging next to a rack of mass-produced greeting cards. Close up, the points are confusing and sometimes chaotic, but when you step back and view the entire picture, the already-lovely colors and dots render into something wonderful, emotionally brutal, and meaningful. I cannot say the same for the overwhelming majority of current popular fiction, and the difference here is refreshing.

Could it be because the story is so abstract or obscure that it makes it is difficult to get across? No, that\u2019s not why. Then could it be that to give an outline would not convey the true meaning of the book? In a way, but not really. (If that makes sense) That would suggest it is one of those pretentious books by one of those authors that thinks he can change the world and Stuart Ayris certainly is not that. The story line is very good but Ayris is also a writer with real soul, with a rich original descriptive style of writing and all those things combine to make this a real gem of a book.

Thus, I was reading Tollesbury Time Forever, thinking, well, this is nothing special. Ayris is just presenting us with a character's voyage that could be hallucination, could be reality, could be a spot of time travelling into the 19th century. Yes, it's subversive, but is it clever? As the now cliched saying (accredited to Cory Doctorow) suggests, \"writing is a socially acceptable form of schizophrenia\", thus what all authors do is present us with presentations of realities that do not exist, but become real in the mind of the reader, assuming they are doing it right. By telling us to begin with that the main character is mentally ill, Stuart Ayris forces me, you and any other reader, to question the validity of the tale he is telling. So, I concluded, yes: it's clever, in the sense that the loss of distinction between hallucination, narrative fiction and biography is socially and politically powerful. But is it clever enough for me? After all, I've fought on these battlegrounds, but, I concede, other readers may not have.Then I turned the page, so to speak.

Well, they do, especially for those of us who remember the times. It's not that universal truths are not timeless, but there are special moments when they are rediscovered and celebrated.

I was a psychiatric nurse at the time. The owner of the house was one of my patients. He had not been seen for two weeks - neither had his wife or his son.What I saw that evening will stay with me forever. On the walls of the lounge, in tiny, neat black writing, were thousands and thousands of words. The torch beams picked them out as if they were groups of well-ordered flies. The words continued up the stairway, onto the landing walls and into the main bedroom. I had been in the house before and had seen some of the writing upstairs.
