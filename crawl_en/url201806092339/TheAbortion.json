This was a very real and passionate undertaking - after his death this collection (known now as The Brautigan Library) was moved to Washington State University in Vancouver, Washington. It might be the most lovingly curated collection of works that nobody other than Brautigan ever wanted. This is the type of story that I love, a commitment to the written word for its own sake, not for the sake of commercial viability.The Abortion is a fictional telling of this true story. The protagonist is the sole librarian of a place dedicated in fiction to what Brautigan would do in real life. It is a wonderful love story - love of the written word and between two people trying to make sense of this world - and it is filled with Brautigan's poetic writing. The mood of the story is airy and light, even though the subject matter is weighty. The author is telling us not to let the world take us down. What could be maudlin and overly sentimental, isn't. He makes it work.\nThe library is old in the San Francisco post earthquake Yellow Brick style and is located at 3150 Sacramento Street San Francisco California 94115\nI live but a few blocks from this address. Is this a real place? If so, what exists there? I refuse to look it up on Google Maps. It's a beautiful sunny day in San Francisco, I walk to the location on a literary treasure hunt. Brautigan is a master of making life imitate art, art imitate life."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward", "userReview": "This book is so damn charming and lovable. Imagine this: a 31 year old hippie operates a library in San Fransisco, where anyone can be an author - just bring in your manuscript and put it up on the shelves. He doesn't get paid, he works because he thinks the work is important. One day, a woman comes in, a woman who is not simply beautiful, but whose beauty is so transcendent that it prevents her from leading a normal life. She moves in, gets pregnant, and the two take a leisurely trek down to TJ to get an abortion. What a fantasy, huh?Even when dealing with a subject as fraught as abortion, the novel maintains its innocence and optimism. More than anything, the novel is a treatise on a state of mind, a kind of carefree naivety. The lives and attitudes of the characters seem so remote from the frustrations and complexities of the modern world. Brautigan wrote The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966 in 1974, and it seems to be an ode to something that by that time was already slipping away. Or maybe that memory of the 1960s was just wishful nostalgia. Was there ever really a time and place that was so free and innocent?"}, {"userName": "Oriana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana", "userReview": "It pretty much breaks my heart to knock this book down from five stars to four, but that's the chance you take when you re-read something that you loved many years ago. The book is still great, of course, with an outstandingly original premise (a library for books people write one copy of, that will never ever get published, let alone read by anyone else), and the characters are super...

I've even carted pocketbook copies of his various novels and his collection of stories around for years, always meaning to read them, never getting around to it.Delightfully narrated, beginning with a quirky narrator in a slightly surreal context (although the building described actually still exists https://www.google.com/maps/place/315...), this lovely novel bops along into a romance and then turns more and more serious and even disturbing--also more real--as it goes on. The narrative is, for all of its absurdity and quirkiness, therefore quite true to life--real. At first mention of the event that the title promises--more than a third of the way through the book--I was thinking that in this review I would praise the novel for expressing my generation's view of the hot-potato topic. It is the reasoned, reasonable, functional situation of human beings residing in a post-industrial modern nation state in a scientific and a technological era of human society who take abortion as a viable medical option: the choice out of unprepared-for or unwanted parenthood. This is why most of us gen-X-ers are shocked and dismayed by the contemporary so-called pro-life movement: ss the first generation to be raised in a United States in which abortion was legal, we accepted it as a great improvement over the horrors of the period in which it was illegal. (Yes, this novel is a bit older than I am in its events and it shocks me to imagine an America that barbaric even though I was 4 years old in the year that the events of the novel takes place.) How this pseudo-religious So-called \"movement\" got started is beyond us. And this novel reminded me why, depicts a real non-propagandistic actual experience of abortion in 1966. It's charming, funny, then rather harrowing, and, ultimately, a lovely novel about good but unique baby boomers of the Hippie ilk falling in love and paying the consequences.It made me think this, if you're interested in a modern take on the abortion debate: When you have disbanded the military, abolished capital punishment, fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and sheltered the homeless; when you have stopped punishing the poor, the addicted, and the prostitute with for-profit prisons, the refugee with internment, and the non-white with humiliating racism; when you have stopped man-made climate change, taken away the gains of the shifty stock brokers, the multi-national corp.s stripping third world countries of their natural resources and selling them deadly goods, and the endless war profiteers--then we can sit down and have a debate about abortion. Until then, the words \"sanctity of human life\" are pure hypocrisy."}, {"userName": "Oakley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1538308-oakley", "userReview": "Another fantastic book by my fave writer. Whenever I'm reading him I start to notice an incredible amount of sychronicity between the things he's describing and the little things that are happening around me. For example, while reading this book my bus pulls into the Fresno greyhound depot right as the hero flies over Fresno and looks down from his plane window. May seem boring in type but it gets increasingly strange as they add up. *spoiler (doesn't matter)His style is so strange I think that many people don't take him seriously even if they love his books. This one is heavier than most and does center around an abortion. I'm still thinking of ways to interpret the surreal plot. The hero lives in a womb-like library unlike any other which he hasn't left for years. Becomes lovers with world's most beautiful woman and knocks her up.

I found this one in a used bookshop some time back, and remember someone once telling me about Trout Fishing in America. He didn't really sell Trout Fishing, nor Richard Brautigan, well enough to get my interest revved up. I was into the beats at the time and not really aware of hippie-lit as such. I was also going through a series of relationships with women who didn't know me beyond a surface level, which resulted in nothing except unread poetry. So I read this one on Friday, and enjoyed it. Not really sure what the message is, or if there really is a message behind it.Simply, it's about a librarian working in a library of \"unwanted\" books written by anyone with the desire to create such a thing. One day a girl shows up at the library with about about her book about hating her own body. She's the most beautiful girl in the world, with hair as black as a bat's. She stays with the librarian and the two of them make love. Eventually she is pregnant, and she and the librarian agree to go to Tijuana where she can get an abortion. They enlist the aid of the librarian's associate who provides them the name of a doctor to see. They go to Tijuana and...The novel is delivered in simple prose with no fancy tricks, no self-aware indulgence that writers often go for in novels about nothing. So you have a novel about nothing, where there exists a place for books that will never be read and two lovers who share a relationship of uncertain prospects.

Richard Brautigan writes like no other, and I still love him to death, but reading him at 40 instead of 20 is a different experience. I used to recommend him to \"young people\" who read the usual counter-culture stuff (Bukowski, Burroughs, Thompson [that's Hunter S., not Jim, who's fallen back out of style it seems:] and Kerouac), but I'm not sure I would now. He's very of his time, and I hate to go so far as to say \"dated,\" but, no, let's just leave it at of his time. Beautiful, gentle, poetic writing, funny, absurd, trippy. If someone like, say, Ryan Adams (who has a book of poetry out now) described a woman as having hair that hung like bat lightning around her face, I'd want to punch him. When Richard Brautigan says it, I go with it.

Similarly, with Richard Brautigan, many know him as the writer of Trout Fishing in America (which has sold around 2 million copies or more to date), which was and still is a great wet fish across the reader's face...in a pleasant way.Really enjoyed it but it wasn't until I read The Hawkline Monster that I could fully grasp the greatness of his full potential as a writer. Now I come to The Abortion - a book as well written as The Hawkline Monster but one which is much more serious in content. Not that The Abortion is without funny moments of his renowned dry, droll and laconic Brautigan wit and humour. It has plenty of that but it also resounds with moments of poetic beauty (for example on page 107 - \"It was hard for a minute and then we both smiled across the darkness at what we were doing. Though we could not see our smiles, we knew they were there and it comforted us as dark-night smiles have been doing for thousands of years for the problemed people of the earth\") and towards the end of the novel gut-wrenching sadness. Brautigan is able to skilfully blend and weave all of these elements into the novel to deliver a powerful punch on the reader. Without going into too much detail, the book is centred around a young man (whom we can fairly safely assume to be based on Brautigan himself) who has taken on the job of looking after a library. This is no ordinary library but one which welcomes all the previously unwelcome and unpublished books around the world by writers of any age. Once you take on the job though, you can never leave the library. As more and more people are coming in all the time. People come in and choose a shelf and have their book registered in the library ledgers. Foster is the narrator's friend who takes care of the books stored in the caves (I guess the library's actual capacity ran out long ago). Then there is the beautiful Vida, a woman so beautiful that she is haunted and chased by her own beauty with admirers here, there and everywhere. Vida gets pregnant to the librarian custodian and they head to Mexico for an abortion, arranged for them by Foster who knows a Mexican doctor who can do it for them. I won't say any more but the book moves ahead at a perfectly timed pace with Brautigan's signature crisp and concise chapters, leading the reader gently towards an exciting finale that has you gripping on to the edge of your book for dear life. Well, kind of. Got a little bit carried away there. My keyboard has been drinking, not me. Anyway...Thank you Richard for another great novel. Brautigan should be compulsory reading in any modern literature class, in my humble opinion.Thanks to the Rikkyo University Library for letting me rent out a copy of this great book."}, {"userName": "Yasemin \u015eahin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33707547-yasemin-ahin", "userReview": "Her Richard Brautigan kitab\u0131 bir Wim Wenders filmi tad\u0131nda! \u0130nan\u0131lmaz \u00e7arp\u0131c\u0131!

The Abortion is the worst of his novels I have read so far, though it has the best opening. The excellent conceit of the library that only accepts unpublished books and is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, has an enormous capacity for fictional possibilities, but unfortunately this novel doesn't do justice to any of them. The story, such as it exists, is really about escaping from this wonderful library almost as soon as the idea of it takes proper shape in the reader's mind.I have been thinking a lot about Brautigan recently. He became a better writer in many ways as he went on, but less of a true novelist. I probably need to explain this more fully elsewhere. It seems to me that The Abortion marks the point at which he started to drift off course (he came back on course later) in the sense that it is a lot less chaotic (and rich) than (for example) A Confederate General from Big Sur and more like a novella that has been artificially inflated by the use of needless repetition and unnecessary incidents. At his worst Brautigan is like Vonnegut at his worst. At his best, he is one of the most startling writers of all.Fortunately The Abortion does have some of Brautigan's trademark uniqueness and utterly unexpected metaphors to lighten the journey of the two main protagonists to Mexico. The problem for me is that this journey, blurbed on the back cover as a series of startling adventures, turns out to be nothing special at all. I suspect that there was a topical moral/political element to this quest for an abortion in Tijuana that time has weakened.I am a huge Brautigan devotee and I have just started So the Wind Won't Blow it All Away which promises to be everything magnificent that The Abortion isn't.

Brautigan is a prose poet of a novelist and this one unfolds like the relaxed field of daisies for hire he describes, brought on by nipping whiskey in the afternoon, newly in love.

You're not at home in the world. \u201d Pg 51I wonder if he could have written a similar book where the woman was classically ugly. But I guess we are all a product of our environment so I shouldn't fault the author or the narrator too much for falling for the babe with the great figure.As for the Abortion part of the story, it is has some salience now given the every increasing restrictions on abortions, (a.k.a. a woman's right to choose). And it was refreshing to hear about an abortion without the right wing hyperbole.Anyway here are some more quotes...\u201cthe stewardesses where like beautiful Playboy nuns coming and going through the corridors of the airplane as if the airplane where a nunnery.\u201d Pg 120\u201cat eighty you'd actually be flying the plane backwards.\u201d Pg 126\u201cI put my hand on Vita's lap and that's where it stayed following the red lights of cars in front of us shining back like roses into San Francisco.\u201d Pg 186"}, {"userName": "Liralen", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen", "userReview": "We don't use the Dewey decimal system or any index system to keep track of our books. We record their entrance into the library in the Library Contents Ledger and then we give the book back to its author who is free to place it anywhere he wants in the library, on whatever shelf catches his fancy.It doesn't make any difference where a book is placed because nobody ever checks them out and nobody ever comes here to read them. This is not that kind of library. This is another kind of library. (20)If this book took itself seriously it would be throw-across-the-room-able; as parody it's brilliant. The narrator runs a library of sorts\u2014one devoted to unpublished and unread works. This is where five-year-olds can take their shakily written narratives about their imaginary dog Spot and where eighty-year-old women living in hotels can bring their manuscripts about growing flowers by candlelight in hotel rooms. Who's behind this library? What's the point of it? Nobody knows. (There's a part of me that thinks Oh! It's the 60s version of the endless stream of self-published books on Goodreads!)The Abortion is a book that just begs to be the subject of theses and dissertations. You have Vida, the librarian-narrator's unexpected girlfriend\u2014he meets her when she brings in a book about how terrible it's been to grow up with her impossibly perfect body; somehow, although male attention has been her worst enemy since she hit puberty, she doesn't mind the narrator's attention. There's the casual swerve from library story to low-key trip across the Mexican border for, yes, an abortion. There's Brautigan's authorial self-insertion by way of one of those never-to-be-read books:MOOSE by Richard Brautigan. The author was tall and blond and had a long yellow mustache that gave him an anachronistic appearance. He looked as if he would be more at home in another era.This was the third or fourth book he had brought to the library. Every time he brought in a new book he looked a little older, a little more tired. He looked quite young when he brought in the first book. I can't remember the title of it, but it seems to me the book had something to do with America.\"What's this one about?\" I asked, because he looked as if he wanted me to ask him something.\"Just another book,\" he said.I guess I was wrong about him wanting me to ask him something. (28)I came across this novel by way of some random person's profile on a dating website, which is the most useful thing I've gotten from said website in ages. Must try to find that profile again to send thanks."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14630856-peter", "userReview": "Richard Brautigan\u2019s original working title for this book was \u201cThe American Experience\u201d...and the experience itself was an abortion. Not exactly a cheery outlook on American life in the 1960s.Initially the idea is treated obliquely and we are introduced to the narrator as the sole worker in a sort of anti-library where authors \u2013 young, old, good, bad \u2013 bring their books to be catalogued, placed on the shelves, and forgotten: never to be opened, never to be read. If Trout Fishing in America references Moby Dick, The Abortion brings to mind Bartleby\u2019s Dead Letter Office or Brautigan\u2019s own iDEATH: the end of the line for creativity, communication, and ideas. The librarian as Terminator. Being Brautigan,of course, this is all conveyed in a wonderfully light and whimsical style. A typical day\u2019s catalogue entries include:\t\tIT\u2019S THE QUEEN OF DARKNESS, PAL by Rod Keen.The author was wearing overalls and had on a pair of rubber boots.\u201cI work in the city sewers,\u201d he said, handing the book to me. \u201cIt\u2019s science-fiction.\u201dThe second half of the novel centres around a trip to Mexico for the narrator\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s abortion, all of which is plainly told in a departure from the author\u2019s usual style. It seems Brautigan actually took a plane to Tijuana in the name of research, incorporating pages of notes into the finished novel. Presumably that\u2019s why much of it reads rather like a dull travelogue and is composed of stereotyped observations on airports, Mexicans, and cheap tourist towns. Maybe it was intended as a real-life counterpoint to the fantasy of the first half but it\u2019s not great reading. A book of two halves...but only half good."}, {"userName": "Thais", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9372695-thais", "userReview": "Un libro con un titolo cos\u00ec forte e un contenuto cos\u00ec delicato non pu\u00f2 non essere letto.

Perch\u00e9 \u00e8 di questo che tratta il libro: di un aborto, e di una storia romantica, semplice, spontanea, senza patemi n\u00e9 corteggiamenti. E l'aborto non \u00e8 una metafora.Nella vita di un giovane bibliotecario, che fa la guardia a una strana biblioteca in cui vengono accolti i libri scritti e portati personalmente da chiunque ne abbia voglia, irrompe la bellissima Vida. Vida, che fa girare la testa a tutti gli uomini che incontra ma che odia il suo corpo perfetto, troppo grande e formoso per lei che vorrebbe solo nascondersi. E si nasconde nella biblioteca, insieme al bibliotecario, e dal loro amore nasce un problema: Vida rimane incinta. Con la massima naturalezza, senza drammi n\u00e9 patemi, i due si recano in Messico per abortire. Non so come spiegare la dolcezza, la spontaneit\u00e0 con cui viene trattato un argomento cos\u00ec crudo. La voce narrante, quella del bibliotecario, \u00e8 di una liricit\u00e0 rara, semplice, immediata eppure profonda.Forse \"La casa dei libri\" attira di pi\u00f9, come titolo. Ma \"L'aborto\" ci riporta sulla terra, a un argomento difficile da digerire eppure molto comune.

I've read Brautigan before, but never any of his novels. The thing that struck me most about this book was Brautigan's use of simile and metaphor. Like Orwell calls for in Politics & the English Language, the connections Brautigan makes in/with his metaphors are wholly original. It's strange; the writing is really simple, almost casual, and you might get the impression that Dick B is nothing more than a slacker hippie with a slight aptitude for the written word and a good yarn. But then he tosses in a piece of imagery or some left-field simile that really throws you. And while the style is subtle, there are little quirks to it that are unlike anything I've seen. It's like this totally normal kid who sits in class just quietly listening, but then every now and then he'll blurt out a robot sound or something, apropos of nothing. So I can't figure the guy out. Is he just being disingenuous with his simple writing, is the subtle undercurrent of sadness buried beneath blankets of laissez-faire hippie-ism intentional, or just my interpretation, or what?Because of the book's simplicity, there was a lot of symbolism that showed through pretty overtly, which I thought was really great. The book is so short that I can't really talk about specifics without giving too much away. I thoroughly enjoyed it and definitely look forward to reading everything else by Brautigan."}], "description": "The Abortion is a genre novel parody about a California library which accepts books in any form & from all who wish to donate\u2014children submit crayoned tales of toys; teens of angst & elders drop of memoirs\u2014\"the unwanted, the lyrical & haunted volumes of American writing\".
