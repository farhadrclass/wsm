Hoffman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1198438-mandy-j-hoffman", "userReview": "The OverviewThis is a year's worth of daily reflections for changing hearts and lives neatly bound together in a small devotional book. From January 1st through December 31st, each day has one short reflection to read which is based off a scripture passage for you to look up and read in your own Bible. It's a compilation of short challenges from various well-known authors like Ed Welch, David Powlison, Paul David Tripp, Timothy S Lane, and others. In the back of the book you can reference things based on Scripture passage or find out what book each day's selection came from if you would like to dig deeper.The ReadabilityHeart Of The Matter is one of the best devotionals I have seen. It is very easy to read but contains great depth and \"meat\" to chew on through out your day. It's written in a way that a teen or adult can learn and grow from using.The HighlightsMy favorite aspect of this devotional is that the scripture passage is listed and you have to open up your own Bible to read it. While this may seem like a downside because it's not as quick or possibly as easy to use, I think it's a great feature because it gets you away from complete dependence on a book and into your own copy of the Word of God. Also the change up of authors each day keeps it interesting and fresh.The DownsideI personally don't see a downside in this. It is short - but one needs to keep in mind that it's meant as a devotional, not a Bible study.The RecommendationThis is my current favorite devotional. I'm not a big fan of devotionals because they usually keep you from actually digging into your own Bible. This one, as mentioned above, makes you open your own Bible and gets to the heart of the matter each day. It's not a \"feel good about yourself\" book, it's a \"let's dig into the truth of God's Word\" kind of resource that is made for small daily doses. It would work great for a year's worth of daily quiet time or a supplement book for an afternoon pick-me-up or a short evening wind-down. It's a great tool for teen or adult looking to spend time daily with their Savior."}, {"userName": "Matthew Mitchell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16314848-matthew-mitchell", "userReview": "I call myself a \u201cCCEF Junkie.\u201dI\u2019m \u201caddicted\u201d to the writings of the leaders of the Christian Counseling and Educational Foundation, a kind of \u201cthink-tank\u201d for biblical counseling based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.I\u2019m \u201caddicted\u201d because they\u2019ve been so helpful to me! Over the last fifteen years, I\u2019ve learned more about growth in godliness, how people change, and how to help others to change from CCEF than from any other one source.It started with reading their Journal of Biblical Counseling, then I started attending seminars and reading their books (and blogs). And then, I found out that they offered doctoral-level seminary classes that fit my schedule. How could I pass that up?!Honestly, I\u2019m an unashamed addict. I read everything that CCEF produces. I think that they have a lot of wisdom to offer the Church today.So, when I heard that there was a new devotional based upon the writings of the CCEF faculty, I knew in advance that it would be good. Unsurprisingly, Heart of the Matter: Daily Reflections for Changing Hearts and Lives is very good. I had already read all of the books that are quoted within Heart of the Matter, so I didn\u2019t need to read every page to know that the content was going to be valuable. But I also liked the format. It\u2019s a compilation book with multiple authors, divided up into 366 daily readings. You get a \u201cbite-sized\u201d chunk of wisdom for each day of the year. For a junkie like me, I get a daily \u201cfix.\u201dI recommend getting Heart of the Matter for just about any Christian who likes to read and wants to grow in godliness. It is accessible, readable, and focused on short bursts of wisdom for change. The main theme is \"change.\" Readings cover areas such as love, hope, grace, redemption, faith, contentment, conflict, relationships, prayer, fear, patience, humility, and anger. It would be no substitute for reading one of the works the excerpts come from, but it might be a good introduction to any and all of them.Of course, by reading Heart of the Matter, you might whet an appetite for more and more CCEF. You have been warned: this stuff is addicting!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27325082-jennifer", "userReview": "Loved this devo!

We need to remember every day how Jesus\u2019 life, death, resurrection, ascension, and promised return change the way we view ourselves and others.

CCEF teaches people how to explore the wisdom and depth of the Bible and apply its grace-centered message to the problems of daily living through counseling, training, writing, and partnering with churches. For more information and a comprehensive list of publications go to www.ccef.org. My Thoughts About The Book: The book, \u201cHeart of the Matter\u201d is a devotional that takes us to the \u201cheart of the matter\u201d concerning a different spiritual topic for each day of the year. The devotionals are written by such highly regarded Biblically sound in the faith and practice authors as Edward T. Welch, David Powlison, Paul David Tripp, Timothy S. Lane and others. From January 1st to December 31st, each day a different author presents good solid and wise counsel along with Scripture to guide and direct our thoughts and affect our behavior for that day. And the range of topics written about in the book is quite diverse covering such life issues as Anger, Depression, Conflict, Change, Relationships, Marriage, Resentment and much more. As it is said, \u201cthere is something for everyone,\u201d in the book. And maybe not every devotional applies but I can assure you there is enough Biblical wisdom and guidance in the book that surely anyone and everyone who knows and loves the Lord and desires to be more like him will receive encouragement and experience edification from it. And the devotionals are as they say, \u201cshort, sweet and to the point\u201d so the book is ideal for Christians on the fast pace of go who wants to be in the know when it comes to dealing with life as it happens. So, if you\u2019re a \u201cshort, sweet and to the point, \u201c \u201dyou can handle the truth\u201d sort of Christian who is seeking a daily devotional that will be encouraging, edifying and at times convicting and rebuking then \u201cHeart of the Matter\u201d is the ideal daily devotional for you.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received the book at no cost from the New Growth Press for review purposes.

Their materials connect the Gospel to all of life and are designed to equip local churches to minister to all of the needs of their congregations. I have previously reviewed some of their books (here and here), and helped teach one of their courses (How People Change). I am constantly impressed by the quality of their work and how practical it is for the real problems people face.New Growth Press has compiled a collection of excerpts from books written by such CCEF authors as Timothy S. Lane, Paul David Tripp, David Powlison, Edward T. Welch, Michael R. Emlet, William P. Smith, and more. The result is a year-long devotional, \"Heart of the Matter: Daily Reflections for Changing Hearts and Lives,\" edited by Nancy B. Winter. This hardcover book includes daily devotional readings for every day of the year. The selections are short and readable, yet thoughtful and weighty. The readings are meant to complement a Scripture text to be read each day.These devotional nuggets provide a practical out-working of a Gospel-centered perspective on all of life that under-girds the counseling approach of CCEF. The sovereignty of God, the reality of the kingdom, the cross of Christ, and grace-based sanctification are a few of the themes explored in these pages. Included in the back of the book is a listing of the source of each excerpt. Particularly poignant daily readings can be traced back to the book they were excerpted from, allowing the reader to turn to the source for more from the author on that subject. Also helpful is a lengthy index of Scripture passages commented on in the book. This index could be used as a guide for reading through the Bible. As you read passages, you can turn to the index and see if any devotional thoughts are available that intersect with the verses you just read.If you're looking for a new devotional for 2012, look no further than this volume from CCEF. I'm confident its Gospel-centered, practical application of Scripture to all of life will make a lasting impression on your heart. It can help facilitate real change, by the power of the Holy Spirit-and that is what CCEF is all about.Disclaimer: This book was provided by New Growth Press.

It is a matter of repentance. We have chosen a path apart from God; repentance is the process of turning back. We have chosen a different story, filled with subtle lies about God, questioning his love, care and compassion. Repentance means to renounce our story and believe that there is only one Storyteller.
