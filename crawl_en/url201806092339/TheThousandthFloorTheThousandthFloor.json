You know the ones I mean. Those meaningless dramas where everyone sleeps with everyone and everyone betrays everyone and you are not required to think too hard. So when people were calling this a \"futuristic Gossip Girl\", that honestly didn't bother me. GG is an old guilty pleasure. Also, Chuck + Blair 4ever.That's not the problem with The Thousandth Floor. This is the problem:\nOn the other end of the call was Atlas, her brother - and the reason she never wanted to kiss anyone else.\nIck.I don't care that he's technically her step-brother; my issue with incest extends way beyond genetic factors. I don't mind when it appears to show abuse or is portrayed negatively, but I got the distinct impression that it's actually supposed to be sexy in this book. And I'm sorry, but I don't buy into the \"consenting adults\" argument for incest, or the comparisons with homosexuality. As Saletan's Slate article says:\nHomosexuality is an orientation. Incest isn't. If the law bans gay sex, a lesbian can't have a sex life. But if you're hot for your sister, and the law says you can't sleep with her, you have billions of other options. Get out of your house, for God's sake. You'll find somebody to love without incinerating your family.\nIt was a huge issue for me in a novel that could have easily been some mindless entertainment. McGee considers many different aspects of what the year 2118 might look like, from technology to global warming to designer babies. On top of that, it's a diverse book, as well as just a very interesting and rather... dazzling idea. Imagine a future where Manhattan literally becomes a vertical city in an enormous skyscraper; the extremely wealthy partying and getting high on the top floors.But I just don't want to read about siblings making out. I read to the end to find out who falls from the tower in the prologue, but I seriously considered not finishing it the moment Avery and Atlas lock lips. There are a lot of characters in this novel, all being young, stupid and scandalous, and I honestly quite enjoyed reading about their superficial lives, but I won't be returning for the sequel. That kind of \"romance\" is just not my thing.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Hailey (HaileyinBookland)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21937982-hailey-haileyinbookland", "userReview": "3.5* (maybe even closer to a 4, so I guess 3.75*)This was a really fun, but also kind of sad, scifi read!

At times I found it difficult to keep track of who's who (maybe partially because I went the audio route for this one). But once I got it sorted I became pretty invested in each character and how their plot line went.

He didn't know who she was, or how she'd gotten outside.He didn't know whether she'd fallen, or been pushed, or whether - crushed by the weight of unspoken secrets - she'd decided to jump.\nI know the book comparisons get old, but think futuristic  Gossip Girl. I was pleased with how excellent the drama was. Definitely one of those guilty pleasure type books. What elevated things for me was the incredible world that was created. Set in New York City in the year 2118 - a world like you've never seen before! The city is a thousand-story tower stretching two and a half miles high.\nLeda caught flashes of color where the elevators shot past, the veins of the city pumping its lifeblood up and down. It was the same as ever, she thought, utterly modern and and yet somehow timeless. Leda had seen countless pics of the old New York skyline, the one people always romanticized. But compared to the tower she thought it looked jagged and ugly.\nThe higher up in the Tower you live, the wealthier you are. Also meaning the lower the floor, the poorer you are. This futuristic world is very high-tech with hovers as cars, retinal scans to unlock doors, contacts as a quicker means of a computer really with the capability of looking stuff up by saying it aloud, sending pings or texts, checking the feeds or social media, etc. The lower the level, the less futuristic tech you will find because they can't be afforded. There's futuristic drugs like halluci-lighters and really all kinds of things. This world is very expansive..The story starts with the inevitable end: a girl falling off the Tower from a party on the thousandth floor. We don't know who she is, how she got there, or how she ends up falling two and a half miles to her death.It backtracks two months and this is where we meet our characters.  The Thousandth Floor is told from five different perspectives.Avery is the girl who was genetically created to be perfect (a word she despises). She lives on the thousandth floor with her parents and brother Atlas. Her life should be perfect, right? Only she is tormented by the one thing she wants, but could never have.Leda is fresh off a stint in rehab, something she won't let anyone find out about for fear of being judged. She's even keeping it from her best friend Avery. It was only xenperheidren which helps to sharpen her thinking. It just felt so necessary until it all got out of control after what happened last year - that hookup with Atlas nobody knows about. And he left after, went missing. The only person he talks to is Avery, but no one knows where he is. Can Leda keep her secret addiction under control amidst the chaos the Tower brings her?Rylin lives on the thirty-second floor with her younger sister. Their mom died a year ago leaving Rylin to work a dead-end job and keep things afloat. She has a drug dealing boyfriend and is always behind on rent. So when an opportunity to work on one of the highest floors in the Tower comes her way, she couldn't possibly turn it down. If only she knew how much this job would truly cost her.Eris comes from old family money and is Avery's oldest friend. Upon new information, her life begins to fall apart at the seams. Her whole world flips upside down.Watt is a genius living on the 240th floor with his family. He has a deep secret that could get him locked up in prison for life. It's also the reason why he's so damn good at hacking. And why he gets hired by one of the upper-level girls to spy on someone making the lies go deeper than even he could imagine.There's a whole lot more to the plot, but I'd view some of these little things as spoilers. It's best to find out as you go along. Just know there's a whole lot more drama involved. There's a complicated and not-so-typical love triangle, financial issues, problems with parents and siblings, a secret addiction, and really so so much more. I even feel like there were some things alluded to, just not quite gotten to yet in the plot. I'm really excited to see where the series takes us from here. I enjoyed all of the characters. Some are more likable than others, but I found myself intrigued by all of the characters' individual stories. I loved the futuristic aspects within the story. I'd like to learn more about how things came to be the way they are, though. I wish there was a little bit more world-building to explain certain complexities. However there was just enough in book one. I only hope to see the world expanded a bit more.Prepare for plenty of backstabbing, secrets, betrayal, romance, and even more. Bonus for excellent diversity. And bisexual characters like it ain't no thang. Finally with it in the future. If you've enjoyed anything by  Sara Shepard,  Private,  Gossip Girl,  Emancipated,  Unrivaled, or any series like these, you'll fall in love with the world Katharine McGee created."}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "DNF.

All the characters in the book live in a giant tower located in New York city. The amount of wealth and status citizens possess dictates where they live in the tower. The wealthiest families live on the top floors, the poorest on the bottom, and everyone else in between. Throughout the story, we follow 5 characters, Avery, Eris, Watt, Rylin, and Leda, and get to read from each of their points of view. The book is written in third person. That's not my favorite, but I think it worked well here. It took me a little while to get into the story, but that was mostly because I was switching back and forth between 5 different people. It was absolutely necessary though to set up the story, and after a certain point, I was hooked! Secrets and lies are at the root of most of the characters troubles. Whether it be keeping them or telling them, no one is immune from the damage they cause. One of them even winds up dead, and finding out who falls from the top of the tower propelled me to plow through the second half of the book. The author did an amazing job of creating suspense in the last few chapters. I couldn't put the book down if I had to!The ending is unforgettable and infuriating! Never has a book ending made me so absolutely livid! I was literally yelling at my kindle like a crazy person. I'm serious. People were staring! It wasn't pretty! Lol I couldn't even rate the book when I was done, because I was so furious! After I slept on it, I realized that the fact that I felt so passionately about the end and that I cared so much for the character that wound up on the ground means that the author did a damn good job with making me invested. I felt so much for the character that met their demise. I wanted to scream! I wanted to cry! I wanted to write to Katherine and tell her that she broke my heart! I would also tell her that she is fucking amazing at the same time. I've seen many mixed reviews for this book, and most of them seem to be due to the ending. I understand why, because it isn't a happy one by any means. We still have two more books to go though, and I'm holding out hope that I'm satisfied in the end! It won't change what happened, but hopefully, it makes me feel better in some way. It's driving me crazy not to grab the second book right away to see what happens next. I'm reading these with my book club though, so suffer I shall until we have the next one scheduled. I recommend this book with the warning that it will drive you crazy and piss you off beyond belief!

Still, there were a couple of elements that made me like this book, and tons that didn't. If you like gossipy high school-ish petty drama this book might be for you, but I'll leave it up to you dear reader whether or not to embark on a 400+ page ride that leads to nowhere. So here are the Pro\u2019s and Con\u2019s.Pros:\u2022 The cover, packaging and art of this book. It's amazingly gorgeous in person, seriously one of the prettiest I've seen, looks great in any library. \u2022\u00a0The technology described in the book doesn\u2019t sound far-fetched and maybe actually achievable in the future; I loved it when she talked about the gadgets they all used, and kept thinking to myself \u201cDamn I wish those were around now.\u201d (The hologram that enables you to try on outfits without having to move a single muscle was my particular favorite).\u2022 The tower concept is also very cool and not something I\u2019ve read about before, I loved the fact that it had absolutely everything in it, from aquariums to pieces of Central Park. \u2022 The idea that a ride to Paris, France is only three hours away by undersea transportation.\u2022 This fact that this book is NOT dystopian as some would have you think, it\u2019s the future yes, but nothing like other YA novels portray it; the only problem seemed to be global warming, (which let\u2019s face it we\u2019re already suffering the effects of now), apart from that everything is just modernized and a reality I could definitely see myself living in. Cons:\u2022 The characters, not a *single* salvageable one - except maybe Maribel (but this remains to be seen in the next book because she has very little scenes in this one); I hated them all a little and for different reasons, but at the end of the day they were all 100% SHALLOW. Although I did have a particular hate for Leda, DIE LEDA DIE! \u2022\u00a0I guarantee the only reason you\u2019ll keep reading till the end is to find out who the hell ended up being scraped off the pavement after falling from the thousandth floor. (Which is actually the prologue of this book so no spoilers there). Which leads me to the next thing...\u2022 The cliffhanger, yes you heard me, after 400+ pages, the plot is left half-way and if you want to find out what happens, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019ll have to purchase the next book.\u2022\u00a0Last but certainly not least - the incest. One of the characters is completely obsessed with her brother, and whilst he is her half-brother, they still grew up together and let\u2019s all face it, that\u2019s f-ing weird. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a sibling myself but I strongly believe in the nurture vs. nature, if you raise someone to be your brother/son/daughter then that is your family, period. So in total I give this book 3 stars and will begrudgingly buy the next one - but only if the cover is as sexy as the first."}, {"userName": "Caitlin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57334157-caitlin", "userReview": "Well fuck.

I really enjoyed all the characters but I\u2019d have to say Watt is probably my favourite but I definitely love Rylin and Avery also. I didn\u2019t predict the twist at all.

Avery was a girl who lived at the top of the tower, and had a crush on the one person she couldn\u2019t possibly be with \u2013 her adopted brother Atlas. We then got a bit of a weird love-triangle going on, with Avery, Atlas, and Avery\u2019s best friend Leda, with Avery hopelessly hung up on Atlas and having no clue what to do about it.\n\n\u201cOn the other end of the call was Atlas, her brother \u2013 and the reason she never wanted to kiss anyone else.\u201d\n\nLeda, Avery\u2019s best friend, had just gotten out of a stint in rehab after getting hooked on a prescription-only medication which aided concentration (xenperheidren). She had previously slept with Atlas, and was intent on repeating the experience, to the extent that she hired a hacker to track his every move and feed her back information.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t need the drugs, not the way those girls did.\u201d\n\nEris, Avery\u2019s other best friend, also lived near the top of the tower, and very quickly found out that he father wasn\u2019t her biological father, and ended up moving to a much lower level apartment with her mother. We then got a surprise about who her biological father really was, which shook things up a bit, and we also got a romantic storyline involving Eris and a girl who lived near her new apartment. \n\n\u201cHer mom had cheated on her dad, and kept it a secret for the past eighteen years.\u201d\n\nRylin lived with her sister on one of the lower floors following the death of her mother. She had a boyfriend who dealt drugs, and a dead-end job, and we got a storyline involving the drugs, and a boy called Cord who lived on one of the upper floors. I was actually quite surprised that we didn\u2019t get a storyline from Cord\u2019s point of view as he seemed like quite a major character.\n\n\u201cTwo hundred nanodollars for just one night dealing with drunk rich kids? \u201cHow soon do you need me there?\u201d\u201d\n\nWatt was a hacker who basically had an AI type thing in his head which was totally illegal, was hired by Leda to try and track Atlas, and developed a bit of a crush on Avery, which was pretty hopeless because of the whole Avery-Atlas-Leda love triangle. His hacking skills were pretty impressive though.\n\n\u201cHe was in possession of an illegal quant, and he needed to hide her somewhere she could never be found.\u201d\n\nThe storyline in this was woven together by the characters interlocking stories, and it seemed like everyone had something to hide. The pace was a little bit slow, but I think this was probably necessary because of how many main characters there were, and the way their stories all coincided. The ending to this was quite shocking, as someone died, and someone else started blackmailing people to cover up their part in the murder!

To say anything else would be a lie considering I did shuffle through PLL, including the companion novels. It can be a fun, light moment. Something you need middle of your hectic life that doesn't give room for the heavy stuff (I miss the heavy stuff, though).The Thousandth Floor was compared to Gossip Girl, which is not a TV-show I have watched, but have this vague idea of it being full of gossip, relationship drama, and yes, money. Sounds good to me to be sure.Drama I wanted, drama I got.The Thousandth Floor has a fascinating setting; a high tower full of societies economical ladders that reflect the real world inside the dystopian high-tech imaginary surrounding. This, by far, is the strongest part of the novel albeit something that is not fully explored and brought to life as the focus is in da drama and in the basic struggles of the rich and of the poor. Structured by multiple POV's , it is almost inevitable that the many characters are build from stereotypes. I could say it is an lazy touch to give, but ultimately it is the safe bet to make when the relationships and drama is the central point of the story, not the character growth and the world building itself. As much it is inevitable that most of the characters are unlikable even when there is traits to my liking. It is almost impossible to create a characters that cause so much drama and still keep themselves lovable and BFFs at the same time. At least in my world view. Even the character growth is minimal, there is a few pointers that speaks for a positive after-impact. I have been bored of the typical addiction trope to be the following: an ordinary boy or a girl tries drugs, gets hooked, screws up and is miserable, everyone is helping or no one is helping, rehab comes and happy ending. In The Thousandth Floor the addiction, in all its quickness, is actually described quite deeply. It speaks of the sudden need to use, this even when giving the stereotypical reason for the initial drug use. It describes greatly how a drug can make a person feel, but also keep its focus on the feelings and urges of an addict when comes to their helpers. I have known too many addicts, inactive as well as active. Spending years in a friendship with a person who was not just my soulmate but an drug addict, I am quite fed up of the ways how addiction is often dealt with in these books but also what is often demanded from the addicts closest ones. As if we closest ones could magically heal someone, or as if we would not do enough or do too much.It is great when an addict goes to rehab, gets clean and builds up a new life for themselves by being emotionally stable, being in a mode of inactive (I do not like a word \"former addict\", I use inactive or active depending on are they clean or using). Then there is us who have witnessed over 25 rehabs, over 10 detoxing times, forced the feared compulsory treatment, encouraged and supported every attempt to get clean without medical help - followed the suffered physical and emotional withdrawals. Experienced the hope of someone getting clean tens of times as well as the reality of someone getting back to their old habits again, the same tens of times. The many OD's.The fighting, the ignoring, the enabling, the distance - all the various ways to deal and try out with an addict you love, care for and try to support even when it will eventually drag you right down with them. A disease that makes everyone sick around it. This even when the addict loves you back the same, when the addict is an wonderful human being. Helping - what a nice word in a fantasy land where an addict is not a slave to their mind that can't handle the real world without substances. Even addiction is handled briefly in the book, there is a lot of hints from the reality of too many addicts, and I appreciate it greatly.I read this book over two weeks. I was busy, I was tired, but it usually does not stop me from reading in every chance I get. This was not the case here. The drama was okay, the taboo topics nice and solid, the world quirky and interesting but the pace was slow and did not hold my attention for the most part. During the end a lot of things started to happen, but it was kind of late to spark my mind for further reading.I might check out the sequel, but it is not something I am dying for."}, {"userName": "Lia  ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48295288-lia", "userReview": "[The \"love triangle\" between Leda, her best friend Avery and Avery's adoptive brother, Atlas, was unexpected, dark and weirdly fascinating.

Not only she probably was the most \"innocent\" of them all, but she was also our only LGBTQIA+ main character. And she died.

Those who live at the top, such as Avery and her friends, live a charmed life filled with parties, drugs, gossip and opulence, while those who live towards the bottom live a life of poverty.

They can watch TV from these contacts, read people\u2019s lips, but the contacts are directed by voice commands. There\u2019s also bars filled with hoverboards, dresses filled with illuminated mirrors and genetically modified flowers that attract light.The real reason I couldn\u2019t stand The Thousandth Floor however, is also the same reason why I couldn\u2019t continue with the Mortal Instruments series past the first few books \u2013 it contains a hefty dose of brother-sister romance, or incest. I don\u2019t care if Avery and Atlas aren\u2019t related by blood and they\u2019re technically step-siblings, but hearing about them pining away for one another made me uncomfortable. And it\u2019s not just a brief mention, in fact most of the book is centered around this and the drama and the fall out from it.I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in any of the characters either, I felt like they got pretty boring really fast. While on the upside, their dramas and complaints seemed to be valid, it was filled with nonsensical friendship and romantic drama that doesn\u2019t really go anywhere until the last few chapters of the book. Avery pines away for Atlas, Leda and Watt who start dating them wonder why they\u2019re aloof, Eris starts dating someone from a lower floor and Rylin starts dating Cole. It all felt a bit too messy and convoluted and no one really interacted with each other outside of the parties outside of their thoughts.Watt was probably the most interesting character for me, who has a supercomputer Nadia embedded into his skull. But when he decided to use his skills for picking up Avery and hacking instead of anything particularly useful, he soon lost his appeal. He also felt a lot like Dan from Gossip Girl, the typical outsider who isn\u2019t that attractive but somehow works his way into the in crowd. I didn\u2019t like Dan at all, which also summarises my feelings on Watt.The heavy use of drugs and alcohol was also rather disturbing here, with Leda as a drug addict recovering from rehab and Rylin\u2019s involvement with people who deal in drugs. Their use of hardcore drugs and partying rarely had any repercussions outside of a simple hangover. You would think for someone like Leda, that this would be handled with more care, but it felt like it was added for more dramatic effect. She used the drugs to cope with the drama but there wasn\u2019t any guilt or much thought around the restraint behind this.Whether you\u2019d be able to stomach The Thousandth Floor depends on your squick level when it comes to sibling romance and a heavy drug use. If someone told me before I picked this up that hey, there\u2019s a brother and sister romance here (but they aren\u2019t actually related), I probably wouldn\u2019t have picked it up. As a futuristic Gossip Girl, it lost it\u2019s shine really fast when the character motivations were paper thin and over-dramaticised. While I enjoy a guilty pleasure read as much as the next person, the limited depth in this one just made it drag throughout the book.I received a review copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Anabel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40127891-anabel", "userReview": "Me ha gustado desde el primer cap\u00edtulo hasta el \u00faltimo.

It was published on 8/30/16 by HarperCollins, 448 pages. The genres are young adult, dystopian, and science fiction. This book is the author\u2019s debut. My Experience: I started reading The Thousandth Floor on 8/1/17 and finished it on 8/9/17. This book is a great read! There are a lot going on because there are many characters to keep up with. Not only that, the technology in this book is very high tech and out of this world. Some are very cool and others are hard for me to imagine, especially how they get from the building to the river to see a comet. It seems like the river is at the tower? I like Watt and his Nadia technology. The stories of the individual characters are interesting. It can be relatable. The Tower sounds very cool.In this book, readers will follow 5 high school students: Leda Cole, Eris Dodd-Radson, Rylin Myers, Watt Bakradi, and Avery Fuller. Leda turns to drugs when the guy she likes left, Eris finds out her life was a lie, Rylin couldn\u2019t be with the guy she loved because of what she did, Watt is a tech genius and does hacking to make extra money, and Avery who is perfect in every way but is still unhappy. They all live at the high rise, The Tower in New York where the higher up you live, the wealthier your family are. This is a futuristic book, therefore, there are high tech in every way, from eartennas to hovercrafts inside the tower. What they have in common is finding someone to love. The wealthy will have a dazzling lifestyles but still struggle with love just as much as the poor who works dead end jobs to pay rent. The wealthy or the poor will turn to drugs when life gets stressed out. Everyone keeps secrets from one another and everyone resents each other thinking that the other has it all. This book is very Gossip Girl style where the rich are spoiled and entitled while the poor struggled to pay bills. The teens are selfish and do what makes them happy. This book is written in third person point of view and readers will get to follow all 5 characters. There is suspense at the end of each chapter for each character. I like following Leda\u2019s train of thoughts. She surprises me the most despite her situations. I like her quick thinking. The ending does leave readers a bit of a cliffhanger. Overall, this book is an interesting read and I do recommend it.Pro: secrets, humor, suspense, multiple point of views,Con: too high tech for my imaginationI rate it 4 stars!***Disclaimer: Many thanks to the author Katharine McGee, publisher HarperCollins, and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and review. I originally lost my access to the ARC and this time I\u2019m reading the finished copy from the library.

My expectations weren't that high for it either, but it ended up blowing me away. This is Katharine McGee's debut novel but it was written as if she is a seasoned author. She clearly has a talent for writing and her style really captivates you. After reading the very first page, I knew that I was going to love this story.The Thousandth Floor is set in the year 2118 in none other than New York City. The Tower is an unimaginable large building that everyone lives in, works in, goes to school, and everything else. Each floor consists of neighborhoods, schools, restaurants, etc. Basically each floor is so gigantic, that it's like a mini-city on each floor. There's no need to leave the Tower at all. There are 1,000 total floors in the building. The higher floors are for the wealthy only, called highliers. The lower floors are for the poorer people. Everything is super futuristic and the technology is amazing. There aren't cell phones anymore. People wear contacts that allow them to see their messages and social media. Retina scanners above front doors let you in instead of having to use keys.The story is narrated by 5 different teenagers whom live in the Tower and they all lead very different lives. Yet their stories all come together at the end.Avery lives on the 1,00th floor, which means that she's the richest and the most popular. She's also the most beautiful, and everyone either wants to be her or be with her. But Avery is hiding a dark secret from everyone..Eris is a highlier as well, and she comes from very old money. She's also friends with Avery, and she's that girl that has had a fling with pretty much everyone. She is also a bisexual character. But something happens that wrecks Eris's world.Leda is yet another highlier, and is best friends with Avery. She's just returned from rehab after becoming addicted to drugs due to her party-filled life. But the reason that Leda started using drugs is back, and she starts to lose control of her life again.Watt is a downlier. He lives on the 240th floor and his family is really struggling with money. So he creates an illegal supercomputer and does jobs on the side for more money. But he begins struggling once he's brought into the crazy life of the highliers.Rylin lives on the 32nd floor and is the poorest of them all. Her parents are gone so she was forced to drop out of school and get a job in order to take care of her younger sister. But her life gets crazy when her boyfriend deals drugs, and she starts working for a highlier.All of the characters, including the huge group of minor characters, were totally enjoyable. Rylin and Cord were my favorites, but they were all great and written very well.GRADING SCALECharacters - 18/20Plot line - 13/15Originality - 15/15Writing Style - 15/15Pace - 14/15Ending - 15/15Total = 90/1005/5 starsIt's a story full of partying, lies, deceit, scandals, drama, romance, and so much more.

I mean come on. Look at that cover. It looks gorgeous. Come on. Look at that.\t- Some of the futuristic aspect that was introduced was pretty good. I really liked that part of the book. There is one character who has a supercomputer implanted on his temple. It seemed so good. I was pretty interested on where that character's storyline was going to go. Unfortunately, I just\u2026 cannot finish this book because of the other aspects of it.\t- The setting is pretty intriguing. I liked where the book was set, but unfortunately, it wasn't explored enough, from what I have read. \t- The prologue was pretty interesting.\nREASONS FOR DNFING THE BOOK\n\t- This book is trying too hard to be unique and diverse. It's trying too hard diversifying the characters by their race, their social status, and their personality, which failed in all those aspect, for me. It was like all of that was thrown in there just for the sake of it.\t- Setting was one of my positives for this book. However, it wasn't developed enough for me to like it. You get thrown into this world with a lot of futuristic things that I can't wrap my brain on. I don't know where this tower starts and ends. I don't know where you even are. When you get thrown into some place, I often try to imagine how they get there because it does seem like moving hover crafts are also inside these towers to get around. I'm not sure if they go out of the tower or just somewhere inside it. I ammmm confused. It sucks because this could have been a lot better.\t- TOO MANY FUCKING POVS. I cannot keep up with all these main characters. I think there are 7 or 6 of them all together. There are a lot of them, and all of them are important with their own storyline, that would probably merge at some point in the story (which I won't be able to see because this book is not holding my attention well enough). It feels suffocating having all of these characters on there, doing their own thing, then jumping from one POV to another, in a matter of a few pages. I can't. I can't.\t- I don't understand the world on which it is built on. I understand they live inside a hotel, but whenever they go somewhere, I'm not sure if they went out of the hotel, or rode something that took them someplace inside the hotel. Those are never really clear. What were the boundaries? Is there even anything else outside the hotel? Do you have everything inside the tower? Is it like a fortress type thing? I dunno. It's not clear to me.\t- The characters were annoying. All of them are. The one I dislike the most, so far, is Leda. She is so big on self-depeciating and thinking she's less than what she really is. I hate that. In the 20% of the book I've read, she does nothing but whine about how Avery is so pretty and shit, and how she's ordinary, plain and just not good enough. It's not attractive Leda. Not attractive at all. \t- The synopsis intrigued me, but after reading a bit, I realized this book was not for me. Everything was very GossipGirl-esque. It did think it was pretty good, but as I'm reading this, I keep on waiting for something to pull me into the story. But there isn't any. :(\nFINAL WORDS\nThis might be a good book for some, but this definitely is not for me. The mystery aspect is immediately overshadowed by the lack of interesting characters and dialogues."}, {"userName": "whenlovespeaks", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56793152-whenlovespeaks", "userReview": "Ein richtig gutes Jugendbuch mit vielen interessanten Charakteren und ihren Geheimnissen und Intrigen.

Too sad it did reached only some of those.This book literally got me like:PROLOGUEPRECEDINGEND\n\nHave you ever read a book that you liked at the beginning, dislike at the middle, and love/hate at the end?

The characters\u2019 lives are really controversial that will make you want to know each of them deeply with their darkest secrets. Some you will love, some you will pity, some you will despise, some you will adore, some you would want to kill, but sometimes what all I can also see are just a bunch of teenagers with utterly complicated lives that has nothing to do except for smoking, partying or taking drugs just to either have fun, waste time, or to forget which isn't actually good because all the partying can also be sometimes boring in this book since it almost happen too frequent. And they are just hard to feel most of the times. Intriguing, but won't just stay with you and touch your heart.The world building is utterly stunning. And that's the most interesting and admiring thing about this book. It\u2019s the New York at its finest. It\u2019s the New York like we haven\u2019t seen before. It\u2019s the New York far from everyone can imagine. Everything is really impressive and truly amazing but not enough to drag me into it. It actually felt like I am just a curious neighbor sticking her nose under the lives of people around her. I didn\u2019t felt myself inside the world.The ending is really mind blowing! It is actually one of my favorites! That's the best pat of this book and the reason I will still read the next book. It drives me insane. I love and hate it at the same time. It\u2019s exactly the ending I was expecting. It even affected me more than I thought it could. You will be blown away by the ending and you will beg for the sequel immediately. I want to give this book a round of applause for the utterly mind blowing experience.Despite the characters' controversial lives, the truly impressive world-building, and the mind blowing ending, most of the time, everything felt flat. I can recall so many moments where I was so CLOSED to being excited or attached to this book but there\u2019s always something that holds me back. My mind is saying that I should feel curious, excited, giddy, but I just can\u2019t feel anything. Maybe sometimes yes, I can feel a little bit of curiosity or excitement but most of the time, I felt nothing at all. Well, except for the prologue and ending where I felt everything all at once.Reading a book, the connection between the reader, the characters and the setting is one of the most important things to me. And that\u2019s the worst The Thousandth Floor failed to gave me.The only thing that held me still and made me finish this book is the curiosity on WHO FELL, HOW DID SHE FELL and WHO/WHAT MADE WHO FELL from the Thousandth Floor. And the ending didn\u2019t disappoint me, it even gave me more than what I imagined, so I\u2019m glad that I held still. Everything is unpredictable, everyone has a secret to keep, everyone has something to protect, and everyone has something to figure out on the next book.\u00a0All the moments of confusion and irritation where I was so close to giving up and dnf-ing this book were worth it and I will still definitely give this duology a chance."}, {"userName": "Cindy \u2729\u263d Savage Queen \u2654", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3222333-cindy-savage-queen", "userReview": "[ since she is determined to solve the mystery of Eris' death, though with absolutely no resources I am curious about how she will manage.
