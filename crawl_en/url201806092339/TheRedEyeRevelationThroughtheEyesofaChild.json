They are led through this perilous journey by Drew's father, Rob, an ex-Marine who will stop at nothing to protect his loved ones. While on this treacherous trek through this urban landscape, they come across two teenagers, Ricky and Yvette, a brother and sister, forced to fend for themselves after losing their mother at the hands of a zombie. Together they search for an escape out of the city in hopes of discovering a place where they can find safety-assuming one still exists-with the newly reanimated dead lurking around every corner.
