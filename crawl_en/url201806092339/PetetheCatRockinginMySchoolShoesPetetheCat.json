Didn't know anything about them, until I saw a Pete the Cat class at my local library for my K-5 grade and signed him up. Then I checked out some of the books, to see if he'd like them. Not only did he love them, but my 2 yr old twins do as well. He's laid back, cool, and groovy with beautiful and colorful illustration. All three of my kids love finding the yellow bird that follows him around on every page. (Makes me think of my Richard Scary books I had as a kid where I was always looking for Goldbug) On top of great stories, there are parts of each story that's a song that's repeated. I just make up the tune, but if you'd like to hear the actual song, each book has an audio and video file on the Harper Collins Children's website. Along with fun things to do and games, the additional website makes Pete the Cat very appealing to my 5 yr old. We're both looking forward to the library class, and I've already reserved the rest of the books at our library. This one is about Pete visiting the different places in his school, such as the library, the lunch room, and the playground. Lots of fun! Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Alissa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2013476-alissa", "userReview": "This book can be a little bit awkward to read since Pete the Cat sings a song throughout the book.

They're such a great way to get younger children excited about reading. Pete the Cat books are engaging and interactive which is exactly what Kindergarteners need. Pete the Cat:Rocking in My School Shoes would be the perfect book for those jittery first days of shcool for the younger ages. Pete is ready to tackle the schol bus, the lunch room and the playground all while wearing his school shoes. It seems no matter what kind of obstacles or activities Pete faces, he keeps a positive mindset and rocks it in his shoes. This children's book talks about a few of the daily activities that children encounter while at school and children can become more comfortable transitioning to these different activities after having read this book.I would specifically use this book, along with several other Pete the Cat books, to keep my Kindergarteners fully engaged during real aloud time. I have seen teachers put together a play using this storyline and song. Very cute and creative! Teachers can also upload the videos/songs for an added resource to class time."}, {"userName": "Alesha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3725967-alesha", "userReview": "Move over  Welcome to Kindergarten  because  Pete the Cat: Rocking in My School Shoes  is my new favorite book for new Kindergarteners. Maybe I was a little biased because after the classroom, the first place Pete visits in his school shoes is the library! Although he's never been there before, Pete doesn't worry (goodness no!), instead he finds his favorite book and sings his song \"I'm reading in my school shoes!\" He visits other important schoolyard locales (the playground, lunchroom) and does many activities (play, eat, sing, paint, write, and add) in his school shoes during the day. He even rides the bus! The kids really enjoyed listening to \"Mr. Eric\" tell the story while they rock out, too."}, {"userName": "Matt Garcia", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16796020-matt-garcia", "userReview": "Not bad.

Pete rocks out at the bus stop, in the classroom, in the library, in the cafeteria, on the playground and he sings his song about what he is doing in his school shoes. For example, he was singing, painting, adding and playing in his school shoes. What I liked most about the book is that it leads the reader into the next place Pete will be while at school, by giving them clues and asking the reader questions. It also uses repetition when he sings his song; I'm rocking in my school shoes, Im rocking in my school shoes, Im rocking in my school shoes, that allows other to be apart of the story telling fun."}, {"userName": "Halley Todd", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6345187-halley-todd", "userReview": "Pete the cat is just too cool while he is in school. Pete is just beginning school, and has some truly awesome school shoes that he is obsessed with. All day long as he discovers new things about school, he never worries or gets intimidated because he has not done something before, mostly because he knows his school shoes are cool. This story incorporates great practices for younger readers by including questions about where Pete is (i.e. the library, the lunchroom). The rhyming of the words gives the story a fun energy, and the reader can't help but to try and mimic Pete's cool attitude when reading out loud. The sounds makes it so easy. The pictures add to the story by illustrating the rooms that the text is describing, so if a young reader doesn't know the word, he will understand by looking at the pictures. The pictures also add humor into the story by adding things, like a kitty door into the back of the school bus. The pictures themselves add to the laid-backness of the story by not being perfect. The lines are fuzzy, and the color isn't always inside the lines, which can be comforting to a young reader who somehow just can't always color in the lines. This story will appeal to both young boys and girls, and will especially help children that are scared to begin school to get over their fears. They will remember how Pete didn't worry at all that day. This book is highly recommended for readers ages 4 to 7."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12291798-tiffany", "userReview": "Genre: PB9This is a great series written by Eric Litwin that makes kids and adults want to get up and sing and dance while they read the book! I love books that can incorporate many ideas and actions into one story and this book does just that. The book allows the reader and the audience to sing, follow patterns and practice their colors all while following Pete the cat through his day at school. Pete the cat is wonderfully illustrated and helps draw readers into his world. The story keeps the reader guessing what will happen next and shows them how to handle different situations that can arise in school. I found the pages that discussed all the noises in the lunchroom to be one of the best parts of the story because it is something that is not discussed as much in school, but can be a problem for a lot of younger students. This story can easily be read every day and to be honest adults would like to read it everyday too with all the great singing that can be done throughout the story! The added bonus that comes with the story is the song that goes along with the story that is available online! I LOVED IT! If you ever have some extra time go online and listen to the songs from any of the Pete the Cat books! They can easily become the song that you can't get out of your head.Three words to describe the book: Happy, warm, cool"}, {"userName": "Bryce Akey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23663457-bryce-akey", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading \u201cPete the Cat: Rocking in My School Shoes.\" I decided to read this book to my eight year old sister.

Written by author, musician, and song-writer Eric Litwin, the reading of the book evokes a musical tune as Pete\u2019s \u201crocking his school shoes\u201d refrain is repeated at every location he visits. Beautifully illustrated with paintings by James Dean, the lines, color, and texture transport readers to Pete\u2019s side on his journey through school with his special shoes. The illustrations vary in perspective from wide angles to zoom-in shots as well as multiple collages that allow readers to see just how busy Pete the cat is rocking his school shoes. Text fonts vary in size and color and serve to accentuate the illustrations as well set up a visually easy-to-read storyline. Inside covers of the book display Pete on the bus, and the outside hard-covers of the book reviewed, were colorful and have an eye-catching glossy finish. While this book has the approximate page count typical of a picture book. It is important to note that none of the pages are numbered. This might be problematic with young readers learning numbers and sequences, but it does not detract from the book aesthetically or from a storyline/arc perspective. A fun-to-read book with lively, colorful artwork, and one of the many Pete the Cat books in a large series, this book would make a good addition to any primary school library or kindergarten class.
