Unfortunately, the concept is way better than the execution. Ettlinger isn't much of a writer; he doesn't manage a consistent or engaging narrative voice, he neglects to look at either the bigger picture or the human stories around him, and he doesn't organize or tie his information together very well. The result is like a very long research report written by a tenth grader.Also, Ettlinger doesn't appear to have any actual thoughts about what he's discovered. Throughout the book, he'll occasionally mention controversies or differences of opinions about various ingredients, but without depth or even thought. In the last chapter, where he should be discussing, he tries, but it's evident he doesn't actually have much to say. There's no conclusion worth the name.So. The writing isn't engaging and the content is shallow. Is there a reason to read this book? Yeah, kind of - it is interesting to find out where ingredients come from. It's just not a book you'll ever want to read a second time. Get it from the library or borrow it from a friend, that's my advice."}, {"userName": "Liza H", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70919-liza-h", "userReview": "Consider the Twinkie...A popular food item, first introduced to the public in the 1930's, which now represents a vast example of how ingredients have changed over the years to meet consumer demand. Honestly, I'd never really thought about it before... that long list of hard-to-pronounce chemicals on the packages of my snack cakes never bothered me. But reading this book not only opened my eyes to what, exactly goes into this innocent-seeming treat, but also how incredibly complex and vast and intricate the entire food industry in America IS. It's shocking to find out how much of our food additives come from products that were once thought to be useless by-products of steel manufacturing. And oil. SO much stuff comes from oil!! Food stuff, concrete, plastic (of course), stuff that goes into our shampoo and soap and toothpaste... it's amazing to discover the origins of all of these things, the intricate web of relationships between manufacturing and food products. I know people who won't eat Twinkies because \"they're made from nothing but chemicals\" but honestly, MOST of the food we buy and eat contain quite a few of these same chemicals... it just goes to show that many consumers don't REALLY know what they're eating anymore. I mean, if something you wanted to eat had an ingredients list like this: hydrogen oxide, cellulose, hemicellulose, malic acid, dexrose, fructose, pectin, sucrose, amylacetate, and citric acid... would you eat it? No? Not natural enough for you? Not healthy? Do you realize the above is the ingredients list for an apple?Anyway, the point of this book was certainly not to tell everyone that Twinkies are just as healthy and natural as apples; it's true purpose was simply to explore WHERE these chemicals that are contained in most food items on our shelves today come from, how they are made, and what it means in terms of the advancement of making better, tastier foods with longer shelf lives. It's astounding how much goes into something as innocuous-seeming as a Twinkie. I'm glad I read this book; it was well-written and informative and even funny at times. I'd love to see it made into a Discovery-Channel-like documentary."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/298667-john", "userReview": "YUK!Twinkie Deconstructed takes us on a journey through the ingredient label of the popular snack food to find out what \"polysorbate 80\" and \"bleached flour\" really are.

It\u2019s probably no secret that food politics is one of my pet topics. The ethics of what we eat, the ethics of what\u2019s hidden from consumers- all of this fascinates me and frightens me and makes me think.An ingredient-by-ingredient, at times laborious but always interesting, breakdown of all the components of a Twinkie, all of which are in just about all processed foods, from frozen pizza to salad dressing. --------MEMORABLE TWINKIE TAKEAWAYS:--------1. Bleached FlourThat \u201cbleached flour\u201d you see on packages? Personally, I\u2019d been envisioning this process as dipping the wheat kernels in a vat of liquid chlorine bleach, then washing it off with a vat of water. No, apparently the actual process is rather more of a national security concern: the deadly poisonous chlorine gas, used to kill people in World War I. There are factories, mostly located where there is lots of salt and hydropower (think Niagara Falls region; we aren\u2019t given any more specifics for actual security reasons), which produce chlorine gas (besides being toxic, it\u2019s also highly explosive). This is then put on very secure iron containers, shipped to the flour factories, which pipe tiny amounts into chambers with the milled wheat to bleach it. 2. SugarSugar, quite apart from its deliciousness, has some interesting industrial uses. It\u2019s a flame retardant used in polyurethane foam. It\u2019s used as a water-based ink for printing on plastic bags. It\u2019s used to clean cement mixers. You can make a cheap bomb if you mix it with saltpeter. 3rd world doctors sprinkle sugar in wounds to soak up moisture to prevent infection. 3. EggsThere are egg-breaking factories that do nothing but yes, break eggs. 4. PreservativesTwinkies are famous for their longevity, but shockingly expire in less than a month, and contain only one true preservative: sorbic acid. Far from the formeldehyde-like preservatives we envision making up the immortal Twinkie, sorbic acid is incredibly safe. Legal worldwide (this is very unusual for additives) and safer even than table salt.5. EmulsifiersRather than preservatives, emulsifiers are the real Slim Shadys of the processed food world. They make up the bulk of those \u201cless than 2% of\u201d ingredients, apparently. Their job is to combine water and fats like oil. They\u2019re also important because they give that smooth mouthfeel that\u2019s so important, that coat-your-tongue-ness that makes us think we\u2019re eating fresh cream when we\u2019re actually eating nasty chemicals. The laundry list: soy lecithin (this one\u2019s actually rather good for you), cellulose gum, whey, mono and diglycerides, polysorbate 60, and sodium stearoyl lactylate. And probably many more, but they aren\u2019t included in Twinkies, so alas we shall never know their names. 6. Crude oil Good old fashioned petroleum is just about everywhere in our food. 7. Fake butter flavour (diacetyl)Fake butter flavouring, found in things like margarine and ice cream and movie popcorn and, of course, Twinkies!- is called diacetyl. Diacetyl is actually found in butter (it really does give it that characteristic taste) and even more in rancid butter (too much of a good thing). In fact, in large amounts it smells horrendous. It\u2019s also found naturally in things like Chardonnay wine. But as an additive, it comes from- yup- crude oil. Also paint thinner. Containers of it are labeled \u201charmful if swallowed\u201d which is rather ominous when you consider this is a food ingredient. 8. Calcium sulfateCalcium sulfate, aka gypsum, aka plaster of Paris, aka \u201cterra alba\u201d in FDA language, has many uses as a food additive. Even though it\u2019s used in small amounts, we will, on average, consume 28 lbs of it in our lifetime. 9. Casein.Casein, an ingredient in milk, is found not only in Twinkies\u2014 it\u2019s also used as a prime ingredient in early plastic, concrete mixes, glue, and paint. -------UNRELATED TO TWINKIES BUT STILL FUN FACTS:------->> The most bizarre discovery story ever (and also the story of the first discovery of any element): This guy Henning Brand (or as I like to call him, crazy old Maurice) was searching for the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (Nicholas Flamel in the flesh). He decided \u201cthe stuff of life\u201d was in the liquids of the body. But blood research was \u201cof the devil\u201d so he decided to look at piss. Which, clearly, much holier. He somehow convinced a convent full of nuns to donate their piss to him, which he played around with for a few years until he managed to distill it down to a ball of \u201cwaxy goop\u201d that either burned up or glowed, depending on how pure it was. One day he took a handfull of this goop into bed with him to try to \u201csoak up some life from it\u201d as he slept (note, this man is a fruitcake) but he just got some serious burns. Because that shit was phosphate. The end.>> The first synthetic dye was mauve.See, I told you.

This book might lead you to expect a modern-day Fast Food Nation or the Jungle, but it's actually a lightweight tour of American food processing that at times almost crosses the line into free advertising. To its credit, you learn a great deal about the brain-busting scope of the food industry, how a single, simple product like a Twinkie depends upon everything from chemical plants in Minnesota to mineral mines in China, and the facts about baking were quite interesting. But this is no expose...it's a cursory guided tour by a deeply \"embedded journalist\" who gleefully reprints uncontested party lines from chemical and agribusiness companies, reassuring us, if not of the safety, then the inevitability of processed food. The quality of the writing is mediocre and interspersed with too many incongruous (and lame) joking asides. Nevertheless, it's very readable and you will learn a great deal. But far from making you fear a product that he has in previous chapters revealed contains (in fact, depends upon!) such ingredients as chlorine and shaved-off-rust from steel mills, the author's final chapter concludes with a mouth-watering description of eating a Twinkie that borders on the pornographic. In short, much like the food product featured in the title, this book seems to promise much yet in the end prove decidedly non-nutritive.Perhaps a good piece to read as a counterargument to Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?"}, {"userName": "Wealhtheow", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76129-wealhtheow", "userReview": "Ettlinger takes us through each of the ingredients that make up a Twinkie, most of which are found in other packaged food as well. It is stupefyingly boring and utterly bloodless. (Only Ettlinger could write a chapter about industrial eggs and never mention the conditions of factory farm chickens.) He also doesn't seem to have a very solid grasp on the science--his explanations are obtuse and often depend on forced metaphors. His explanation of trans-fat was sadly mistaken and managed to witter on for about a page without a single mention of chirality.

He'll visit the mine it comes from, or follow how a food product is converted from petroleum, or whatever. I was intrigued by the chapter on flavors, and colors. Absolutely fascinating, and makes me wanna eat nothing but veggies. Cuz as he points out, \"Eat your own vegetables and fruits raw, and you've reduced \"processing\" to washing\" (p 2). And who knew Mom was there in Iowa when corn syrup began: \"the Clinton Corn Processing Company, where high fructose corn syrup was first mass-produced in 1967\" (p 56). I also was unaware that the American Chemical Society designates sites as National Historic Chemical Landmarks (e.g. the Rumford Chemical Works, of Baking Powder fame, p 138). Other interesting info:--\"In the 1950s, soda was sold in 6.5- or 8-ounce bottles (containing 88 to 100 calories per serving) as an occasional refreshment; today, it is regularly served in 20-ounce bottles (at 240 calories a pop) and sometimes even 64-ounce servings (what does Coca-Cola expect you to put into its Monster Mug--milk?). More important, today, soft drinks are far more often consumed as a common, mealtime beverage, than as a special treat.\" (p 69)--\"Scientists know where to look (the liver and the pancreas, for starters) but here in the early 200s, after thirty years of common use, the proper broad and long-term studies about the effects of HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) still aren't being done.\" (p 70)--In reference to food colorings, \"Their function is essentially a psychological one.\" (p 249)--How about the meaning of the numbers in Yellow No. 5 or Red No. 40? \"It took some digging to reveal that the numbers signify nothing more than the order in which manufacturers submitted the artificial colors to the FDA for approval... missing numbers are for colors approved only for nonfood use... some were approved and never used; and some may not have been approved at all.\" (p 253)But it all comes back to us, the consumers: \"These companies' embrace of science is simply limited by their obedience to the marketplace and governmental policies... we love the results and express this feeling unequivocally with our purchasing power, enthusiastically demanding more protein sources, a wider range of food choices, lower prices, presumably safer and less spoiled food...

I consider myself above average as far as intelligence. Somewhat science-y (obviously language isn't my thing since I like to make up words). But I kept having to re-read things because they didn't make sense. Then I realized that part of the problem was that Mr. Ettlinger seemed to have this love affair with commas. They were everywhere. And a lot of time, they were in places where they shouldn't have been. So I was pausing like the comma told me to, and then getting all tripped up because pausing made the sentence weird and confusing.

The author goes on a number of spectacular journeys to find how ingredients are created from raw materials, and then how those are combined to make the familar snack, but there is little besides the ingredients list tying the story line together. The book however was packed with factoids like how artificial dyes are created and who invented Listerine, but I was frustrated by the dismissiveness the author seemed to bring to anticipated reader concerns about the artificial ingredients. I think it could have been a much stronger book if the author used the twinkie as a starting point, and began to put processed foods in a greater context of the economy and the country's health in general.

And you know what? It made me really want a twinkie.Now I know what FD&C Yellow No. 5 is and what it does, and what emulsifyers and shortening and leavening agents are and do. Basically what it comes down to: Twinkies don't have eggs or milk or cream in any of those conventional senses, so they need a bunch of stuff that does the things that those things do. These are the chemicals added in minute amounts that you see on the product label. Polysorbate 60? I know what that is now. And there is only one 'preservative', the highly innocuous Sorbic Acid.Ettlinger's scope is not broad or deep, but he manages to do justice to the Twinkie instead of just vilifying it offhand as the symbol of all processed (=bad) food. Sure, he sounds a little naive when he talks about big industry and production processes and chemistry that he really doesn't understand (he doesn't claim to; nor is he ever shown the 'full' picture for proprietary reasons).It is a nice counter-point to the highly charged debate of 'local agriculture' (=good) vs. agrobusiness (=bad) that is becoming more and more politicized (and shrill). He just says 'this is what's in a twinkie and this is how it's made (or distilled or mined)' and then he lets us make up our own dang minds about it. I respect that.One thing I came away with was the shocking realization that petroleum is the starting point for many of the additives that go into processed foods. There is figuratively (not literally) oil in your twinkies. That should be a sobering thought, given that even our food manufacturing process is highly dependent upon oil (much of which is foreign).So yeah, I think we should buy locally, eat less meat (and less in general), and watch our calories. The business of food processing companies from corn to chemicals is to get us to consume more. All you have to do is say 'not so much, please'. Look, it's not going to kill you to eat a Twinkie, just as it won't kill you to eat a slice of cake every once in awhile. But in each case you should know what it's made of and where it comes from and for that, I'm grateful for Ettlinger's game attempt at telling us where processed food comes from and where it goes."}, {"userName": "Johanne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7223888-johanne", "userReview": "Everyday we eat a gazillion processed food, and yet, who can pronounce all those fancy name on the ingredient list, let alone explain where they come from?What's polysorbate 60, anyway?In this book, Ettlinger took one of the most quintessential North American snacks, the Twinkie, and, well, deconstructed it. Ingredient by ingredient. Including water (yes, there's a chapter on water!)By reading this book, you won't become completely grossed out by processed food, nor will you feel you need to start a revolution and go back to growing your own stuff in your backyard, wheat, pig, and all. But you will know what you're eating. Some are good, some are bad, and some are middle ground. By like Ettlinger says in his final chapters, which nicely puts everything back into perspective, \"reduced to the absurd: should the ingredient H2O scare us because it is often found mixed in with acids and poisons? [...] Isn't moving molecules around what you do when you fry an egg or bake a cake or even boil water?\" (p. 261)Of course, processed food ARE chemicals. And processed food will not always have all the nutriments you would find in natural food, yet alone be as healthy calorie/fat/everything wise. But once in awhile, it can be satisfying.So if you like to know what you put in your mouth, then go ahead and read this book - it's actually pretty entertaining regardless of the all technical stuff it covers. You'll then be able to read an ingredient list and actually make more of a sense of what you see, as well as make slightly more informed choices when you buy your inevitable processed food. My only drawback with the book: a paragraph (or two) on the actual nutritional impact of the ingredients would have been nice. But at 263 pages, it already covers a lot, and if anything, it just gives you the motivation to dig deeper... now that you have a background into the subject, enough to guide any additional research, even if amateur!And like Ettlinger said, \"At least now you know what you're eating\".

But his writing style is dull and I wasn't quite sure what his point was. He didn't seem to be encouraging a return to real, whole food, even though his research and his visits to mines and noxious vats where they brew up Twinkie ingredients would certainly warrant that. Instead, he almost seemed impressed with the level of chemical manipulation necessary to produce a piece of \"cake\" able to sit on a shelf for two years.

This book steeled my resolve to eat more homemade food, although to its credit it wasn't trying to and maintained a wonderful journalistic detachment throughout.

I came away from it with the same horror that I felt when reading Silent Spring. It is fascinating. I learned all sorts of things: flour dust can be explosive (along with corn, cocoa, and cotton). I also learned that phosphorus in our food was once also used to make tracers rounds and incendiary grenades used by the military. It also reminded me to reread Sweetness and Power."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5189474-sharon", "userReview": "Each element of the Twinkie is described in a chapter.

And, like most consumers, he often reads the ingredients label -- without a clue as to what most of it means. So when his young daughter asked, \"Daddy, what's polysorbate 60?\" he was at a loss -- and determined to find out.  From the phosphate mines in Idaho to the corn fields in Iowa, from gypsum mines in Oklahoma to the vanilla harvest in Madagascar, Twinkie, Deconstructed is a fascinating, thoroughly researched romp of a narrative that demystifies some of the most common processed food ingredients -- where they come from, how they are made, how they are used -- and why. Beginning at the source (hint: they're often more closely linked to rock and petroleum than any of the four food groups), we follow each Twinkie ingredient through the process of being crushed, baked, fermented, refined, and/or reacted into a totally unrecognizable goo or powder with a strange name -- all for the sake of creating a simple snack cake.  An insightful exploration into the food industry, if you've ever wondered what you're eating when you consume foods containing mono- and diglycerides or calcium sulfate (the latter, a food-grade equivalent) this book is for you.", "title": "Twinkie, Deconstructed: My Journey to Discover How the Ingredients Found in Processed Foods Are Grown, Mined (Yes, Mined), and Manipulated Into What America Eats", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/434052.Twinkie_Deconstructed", "average": 3.34, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442779997l/434052.jpg", "reviews": 353, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/138699.Steve_Ettlinger", "name": "Steve Ettlinger"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Food and Drink", "Science", "Health", "Health"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/434052.Twinkie_Deconstructed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1078109.Twinkie_Deconstructed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1624299.Twinkie_Deconstructed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7155325-twinkie-deconstructed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23492335-ingredients", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237028.The_Complete_Illustrated_Guide_to_Everything_Sold_in_Hardware_Stores_and_Garden_Centers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12456980-the-complete-illustrated-guide-to-everything-sold-in-hardware-stores", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25970810-ingredients", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/659672.Restaurant_Lover_s_Companion"]}
