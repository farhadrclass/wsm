I propose that R. S. Carter has masterfully accomplished this mind-blowing task in the ever-so-haunting book Days of Love and Blood. Having read many a zombie post-apocalyptic story, I was surprised at the depth and flaws of the main characters and soul evaluating journey they undertake. This book is not for the faint of heart! It is gruesome, violent and difficult to swallow at times; yet the shocking world these characters find themselves in is cruel and needed to be portrayed as such. Of course, this book draws up some good old controversy regarding the death penalty in a lawless world where justice is served by survivors and where swift, deadly justice may be the key to survival. However, it is one thing to kill an infected homicidal ruled by a virus ridden brain and another to kill just plain sick homicidal humans or is it?Days of Love and Blood is powerful, thought provoking, gut retching, tear jerking and an artistically written, special story; therefore it has to earn 5 stars"}, {"userName": "L.A.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4055856-l-a", "userReview": "Article first published as Book Review: Days of Love and Blood by R.S. Carter on Blogcritics.Can there be a post-apocalyptic world in stories these days without zombies being the force of our enemies. With the popularity of the zombie horde I found it refreshing to find a story just a bit different. In Days of Love and Blood by R.S Carter, the world is changed in short order. A virus with quick acting damage moves swiftly killing or transforming those infected making them much different than who they were. Cognizant of life they seek only to maim and kill, with no other focus. The virus is still in play yet slow acting, creating creatures out of your nightmares. Not zombies, for this new danger of lost souls are still thinking and have brains, yet they have a single purpose and that is to kill.As Carson, a young woman escapes with her son Ronan, she is grief stricken with the brutal death of her husband. Looking for a new life, she heads for the only safety she remembers\u2013\u2013her parents farm. Can they have survived the Demon virus that has decimated the entire world? As she makes her way, she uses all the skills she has learned to fend off and kill her attackers, as they track her mercilessly. Protecting herself and her son, she finds a group of uninfected people very close to where she is headed. Warning them of her pursuers, she helps to fight and protect the group. Here she finds the human interaction she needs. Can she find love again, in a world that has gone crazy?Carter has put together a dangerous and unique love story, filled with feeling and hope. Using characters that you can relate to, he draws you in to the world, where you experience anger, fear, friendship and love. Carson is strong and her shell is tough from her experiences, but she also has cracks in her armor that make her likable. Her son gives her that human touch that would be missing without his presence. She has skills with a sword and yet is helpless with a gun, so the interactions are sometimes brutal. She is also somewhat callus due to her experiences, but when the thaw comes you are enchanted. If you enjoy the post-apocalyptic venue, and are looking for something beyond zombies, this is the book to take you there. If you enjoy romance and camaraderie, and the adjustments that come with finding a home and family in situations of daily struggle, you will enjoy the world created by R.S. Carter. Days of Love and Blood is a step away from the usual, yet has the action and danger that keep you going. The challenges are tough and the feeling are tougher, so be prepared to find time to read in one sitting. You will find it difficult to put this down once you begin. You may find yourself checking your doors and looking out your windows, making sure your own safety is intact. This would be a great book for a reading group, sending out shoots of spiraling discussions dealing with the different issues and choices that weave throughout the story."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5362508-lori", "userReview": "\u201cA post-apocalyptic zombie book for women. Without the zombies. Worse than zombies.\u201d After reading this part of the book description, I just had to know what in the world could be worse than zombies. R.S. Carter not only recreates creatures that are truly worse than zombies, but she also creates an enthralling post-apocalyptic community of survivors.The author creatively tells Carson\u2019s story in present time on the one hand and through memories on the other. By telling Carson\u2019s story in this manner, the reader is able to see how Carson was before the Demon Virus as well as in what ways she has stayed the same and in what ways she has been changed by these experiences. Life for Carson and her son, Ronan, changes completely when they meet Cooper and the other survivors. Carson and Cooper find comfort in each other\u2019s company. Grief and a post-apocalyptic world make starting a new relationship complicated. By intricately interweaving their growing friendship and their dealings with other survivors and \u201chomicidals,\u201d R.S. Carter creates intense anticipation for Carson and Cooper to finally find common ground and give into their feelings for each other.A shocking and very violent plot twist at the end of the story will have you questioning if you would have handled things the way Carter does. Days of Love and Blood is a thought-provoking novel that will haunt you long after you have read the last page. If you have been enjoying the various zombie books on the market as of late \u2014as I have\u2014 Days of Love and Blood should be at the top of your zombie TBR pile.

This story makes you question how far will you be willing to go to survive and to keep safe the people you love and what can you lose in the middle of it.I enjoyed how throughout all the book I got the chance to know more about how was Carson\u2019s life before the virus started to spread, this allowed me to be more engaged to her character, and then there was Copper, I just love his character.This book made me feel many emotions: fear, anticipation, anxiety, tenderness, compassion, at one point I was angry for what was happening (I won\u2019t reveal any spoilers here) and at another I was even crying.The story had everything to keep me interested: action, romance, suspense, drama, I started reading this book around 8 pm and I couldn\u2019t put in down until I finished it (It was 4 am).I truly recommend this book and I'm looking forward to read more from this author in the future."}, {"userName": "Marc Bolda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15036099-marc-bolda", "userReview": "A fascinating and original take on the whole zombie genre with the usual end-of-days-and-everyone-but-the-few-got-the-disease scenario but with a refreshing and interesting approach that sort of mixes blood curdling horror with heartfelt romance in a most satisfying and believable manner. The protagonist Carson both loses and finds love under the most wrenching of circumstances and the author clearly understands what it is to be a parent as the relationship between Carson and Ronan, her young son, is lovingly and evocatively portrayed as the centrepiece of the story. Oh, and for all you action junkies, Carson wields death and mayhem to all who deserve it with her razor sharp twin katanas and the fast-paced scenes of carnage add a welcome contrast to the emotional development of the principal characters. The ending left me wanting to know more, so readily was I drawn into this world, and I sincerely hope the author writes a sequel, as I would most definitely buy!

Those it doesn't kill, it turns into mindless zombie-like killers, known as \"homicidals.\" Carson, a young mother, is among the tiny population lucky enough to be immune to its effects. After her husband is killed by homicidals, she drives across the country with her son, a toddler named Ronan, in hopes of finding her parents. What she finds instead is a small community of fellow unaffected survivors.Days of Love and Blood is a hard book to categorize. The majority of the novel details the day-to-day struggles of Carson and the community. They must gather what they need to survive while warding off attacks by homicidal packs. In that sense, it's a post-apocalyptic sci-fi novel. However, it also reads a lot like a romance novel. Each chapter opens with a flashback, in which Carson recalls her life with her husband. One of the first people she meets once she reaches the community is the attractive tough-guy Cooper, who initially infuriates her, but whom she soon learns is more than meets the eye. There's even a love triangle sets up when the mild-mannered Ben arrives, although he doesn't show up until pretty late in the Carson-Cooper story.This book takes an interesting approach to zombies. Homicidals aren't reanimated corpses; they're diseased humans. But from what we see, they've lost any hint of humanity. They kill simply for the sake of killing. The moral implications of killing them are discussed in a few scenes. After her husband's death, Carson gets a sick kind of satisfaction from cutting them down. An independent woman with deadly sword skills, she's a classic tough-girl heroine who's fiercely protective of her son.Her relationship with Cooper is an interesting one. While I personally didn't approve of her acceptance of his bad attitude, I can see his appeal as a romantic lead. Like many brooding tough guys, his jerk-like behavior is explained by a tormented past. His manly man demeanor initially clashes with Carson's self-sufficiency, but he develops a certain respect for her, and their often heated interactions are entertaining to read. Much of this book consists of dialogue, which R.S. Carter certainly has a knack for. The characters' voices ring true, especially Carson's narration. The writing is blunt and straightforward, which both convey's Carson's attitude and keeps the pace moving along. The character development and interactions Also, there are a number of exciting action scenes in which Carson and the others face of with homicidals.All in all, Days of Love and Blood was a pleasant surprise. It examines the human side of a zombie apocalypse, focusing on the emotional and psychological toll such a catastrophe could have. The hope, the despair, the tragedy, the need for human connection... The story has a natural flow to it, which makes it hard to put down. At the heart of this book is the question of what people must do to survive, and how that can change them."}, {"userName": "Justine Winans", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7513855-justine-winans", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to get a copy of Days of Love and Blood so I can post a honest review, and I am going to do exactly that.I was exceptionally pleased with this novel, and am fully satisfied now that I have completed it.To begin with, the idea of the story is really cool. The zombie apocalypse seems to be the in-thing now (not that I am complaining) and Carter finds a new spin to put on this genre. A \"Demon Virus\" spread throughout the world, destroying the majority of the world's population, except for those who lack the certain gene that it affects (reason to get your genome coded, am I right?) If the Virus itself does not kill the victim (which it will, eventually), they will become a \"homicidal\" - still be able to speak and move, but losing all sense of remorse, and feeling the need to kill everyone not infected with the virus. Which leads us to another great part of the novel, the excellent characters.Our protagonist is Carson, a tough young mother who is trying to keep her son, Ronan, alive. I found Carson a realistic character, and pretty awesome. First of all, she kills the homicidals with her two swords. If that doesn't make one a BAMF, nothing does. She is clever, witty, and her love for her son is very inspirational. After traveling alone with her son in an RV, Carson comes across a farm area that houses a group of survivors - including her childhood friend, Ivy, as well as Cooper. Cooper has problems with his anger, and can be impulsive, but he also proves to be very loving and entertaining. I thought that he was a great character. All of the characters in Days of Love and Blood were well-crafted and believable. I thought the dialogue was very realistic, which is refreshing to see.Another great thing about this novel is the psychological issues that are addressed within the story. Showing how people can cope with so much loss, and how this near end-of-the-world situation affects personalities. I also really enjoyed the idea of questioning what is right and what is wrong, especially on the topic of killing. That is something that I like to address in my own writing, and it is always cool to see it in the works of others. I was blown away by how perfect Carson's character grew and responded to this topic.R.S. Carter combines the well-developed plot and characters with realistic, well-written narrative writing to craft a truly amazing tale. If you are looking for a great read for a wide variety of tastes and ages that will keep you reading at the edge of your seat, I would highly recommend Days of Love and Blood."}, {"userName": "Kristin (Blood,Sweat and Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6974252-kristin-blood-sweat-and-books", "userReview": "Reviewed originally @Blood,Sweat and BooksIf The Crazies and The Walking Dead had a baby with the Lifetime Movie Network you'd have the book Days of Love and Blood. The characters felt familiar, the romance was predictable and the \"Zombies\" well they aren't really Zombies at all and yet, I didn't care. Days of Love and Blood might not be the most original book on the shelf but it still entertained me and when it comes down to it that is what matters. Days of Love and Blood managed to not only reel me in but keep me hooked until the very last page and at least part of that is due to likeable characters. I really liked Carson. She kicked ass yes but was so much more than a heartless killing machine. Carson had layers and just when I thought I'd figured her out she'd surprise me and reveal more about herself that I didn't see coming. The only downside I had with Carson came towards the end of the book. I don't want to give why away but it just didn't sit right with me. I'm not saying she deserved what happened but......well I'll let you form your own opinion on that one.I also really liked the world building. Yes, the story mainly takes place after The Demon Virus wipes out humanity but we certainly get to see plenty of the life in the before as well. I think my only complaint in regards to world building is the story spent way to much focusing on Carson and her relationship with Ritchie. If he had been around more at the beginning I might feel differently but the story takes place months after his demise. I didn't see it as building up Carson as a character but instead tearing down her husband to justify her relationship with Cooper. Overall, I really liked Days of Love and Blood. The writing, the characters and the story were solid. I didn't even mind the romantic aspects of the story and that's saying something. My only real complaint is the ending. I really hated how everyone seemed to treat Carson as a pariah. Hello? She was completely justified in her actions. I'll never understand the logic that seemed to be going on during those last few pages. I also feel as if the story could've been tied up better as it did leave me feeling a bit unsatisfied. I don't remember if this is a stand alone or series but I'm hoping it is a series because I definitely feel more story is left to tell. We need a cure still after all!! With that being said, I will be rating Days of Love and Blood by R.S.

I must admit that R.S Carter did surprise me with this novel and it definitely achieved what it stated.I liked how the book wasn't focused on the zombie apocalypse but rather it was in the background and more of the driving force for Carson's actions. I've read a few zombie books that go into huge amounts of detail about how they were created and about a small group trying to survive. Although this book was about surviving the story was based more around Carson's desire to protect her son rather than the zombies. Carter gave enough information for the reader to understand what had happened to the human race but it wasn't the main focus and overpowering. As well as this Carson's emotions where developed incredibly well throughout.I liked the way every chapter started with a flashback of Carson's previous life with her deceased husband. It gave extra insight into the story and helped engage the reader even more. At times though a few did confuse me. Some seemed slightly random and didn't give as much detail as I would have liked so I could make sense out of what was happening.This book keeps you on your toes with many twists, especially at the end. I didn't think the story would take the path it did and I'm really not sure what to make of the last few chapters. The book had hinted at things all the way through but the ending did become darker than the rest of the book and although I normally like dark novels it became a bit to graphic for my tastes as I wasn't too keen on the subject matter. As well as this the ending was slightly predictable as I find the same kind of things happen in the end of zombie novels, however it did tie everything up and didn't feel rushed so left the reader with a sense of resolve.Overall this succeeded in being a zombie book for women. It was nice to read a book from this genre where the zombies weren't the main focus and the characters were developed well. I wasn't too keen on the last few chapters but that purely down to personal tastes in subject and would recommend this book as it is an interesting read. I would not recommend it to a younger audience though due to the language and some content."}, {"userName": "Yawatta Hosby", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8447063-yawatta-hosby", "userReview": "***I received a free copy in exchange for a book review***I loved this 21 chapter book. It was written in Carson\u2019s first person point-of-view. I felt bad for her right away because her husband died by the hands of the violent people possessed with the Demon Virus. She was emotionally torn since he begged her to run for her life but she wanted to stay and die with him. Their son motivated her to live, even though she lived with regret of losing the love of her life. I thought the opening scene started off really strong, and I knew the story would pull at my heartstrings all the way through the end.The author had a brilliant talent with plot. R.S. Carter didn\u2019t have any boring parts of the novel, and there wasn\u2019t any excessive backstories to slow the action down. The story was great with pacing; it was a fast read for me because I was entertained and needed to know the ending to the characters I cared about. Carson wanted to know if her parents had survived, so she and her son took a road trip (dealing with violent crazies along the way) to her hometown. There they found a small colony of regular people and they found a new home.My favorite lines: 1) \u201cIsolation can turn you into a whack job.\u201d 2) \u201cFor someone so shy, she was doing well at being nosy.\u201d 3) \u201cWhatever. You know what? Since it\u2019s such an inconvenience for you to be in the presence of a woman with an opinion, I\u2019m gonna keep talking just to piss you off.\u201d 4) \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked brusquely. First he insults me, now he comes into my camper and ogles me?I loved the characters\u2019 dynamics. The women were strong and were respected in making decisions among the group. The men were the protectors and all gentleman-like, except Cooper. I loved the tension in all the scenes, especially Carson and Cooper\u2019s dynamic. It was like he was an elementary kid pushing the girl he likes on the playground. They were cute together, and it was touching how he bonded with her son. In fact, her son was adorable\u2013I loved his interactions with his mom too.The group didn\u2019t have to just worry about the crazies infected with the Demon Virus; Willie and Anand were evil too.

She makes it to her parent\u2019s house and comes across a group of survivors, one of them is her old high school friend, and then there\u2019s Cooper. Cooper is one of those southern country redneck guys, with a shotgun, what more could you want in an apocalypse. For most of this book I wanted to jump into the pages and either beat him with a bat or steal him for myself. He is an ass most of the time, but he has his moments. When Carson starts to get close to him he recoils, the times he\u2019s not an ass you just cant help but fall for him. He has some very big secrets of his own. The other guy she meets is Ben, he is a sweet guy, but nothing like Cooper, Ben is a coward and doesn\u2019t even know how to protect himself. The fact that Carson even considers looking at him as more then a friend, made me extremely angry, I wouldn\u2019t want a guy like that with my kid in an apocalypse. By throwing in a guy like that into the middle of the survivors made it more believable, we can\u2019t all be shotgun-loving rednecks. Cooper was by far my favorite character in the book.This book really made me think about what life could be like, and Carter touches on some pretty raw emotions, and some things that you never think, she also makes you think about what some people are capable of. I still managed to sit down and read in one sitting, and even when I tried to put it down, I just could not, and believe me I did try to put it down it was about 4 am when I finished it. All in all, this entire book is a romance but it has action and drama in all the right places, and will keep you on the edge of you seat until you finish it.

There was a lot of violence, some truly evil men, and heart break. I teared up at least once. But I also laughed a lot and most importantly Carson was a character I understood. She was... was... was... hmm, think Sarah Connor meets Beatrix Kiddo, who then takes on The Walking Dead. She's one scary mamma. Really, the herding homicidal zombies are just the backdrop that gives this story a setting. Carson's love for her son, grief, struggle to let herself accept love and go on with her life are the true story here. And it's a good one. I liked it a lot. I also absolutely adored Cooper. He was flawed, really flawed, but his emotional honesty was heart wrenching. It and his good-'ol-boy drawl were the star of the show as far as I was concerned. Ben, Ivy, Ronan and all of the others had their place too, but Cooper was my uncontested favourite. Lastly, I appreciated that bad things happened. I don't mean that in any sort of sadistic way. I just mean it's realistic that there isn't always a hero to show up at the last second to save the day. A lot of authors wimp out before allowing their characters to really suffer. That doesn't happen here. Some of the latter scenes were hard to read and, honestly, I don't know if I found it necessary for the plot to go there in the way it did. If for no other reason than it's such an over-used plot device for creating outrage. I had come to expect more from the book. I know I thought the whole 'this has happened before' schtick was a bit much for me. But I still appreciated the realism of allowing the story such dark elements. My only real complaints are that the whole 'warrior mother' was a little heavy handed at times and I found some things a bit repetitive. But these are small qualms in a sea of rose coloured love. This book is definitely worth picking up."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383239-autumn", "userReview": "Rating: 4 1/2 starsI received this book to give an honest review.I was impressed with this book, in more ways than one. You have a woman who is pretty much badass in taking care of herself and her child. In a way this book reminded me of The Cell by Stephen King as if you read that book you know people went crazy as well. I liked Carson and how she was a survivor not only for herself but for her child as well. And she killed the homicidals with a cool ass set of weapons. I kind of wanted to get some training in myself just in case!! I am not sure if I could what she had to in order to survive with all the crazy homicidal people running around.I think the one thing that though me off and I would just wonder okay what does this have to do with anything is when you would go back and forth with her memories and the main storyline. You would just reading a part with action then all of a sudden you would be jumping into a memory she has with her past and her husband. In a way it deterred me from giving this book a 5 star rating.This book had a bunch of twist and turns that I did not really see coming especially the ending. I so did not see that coming and was very surprised. This is one book that will keep you on your toes and leave you staying up late at night just to see what is going to happen next.Another main character was Cooper, at times I could feel his heartbreak but then when he started acting the way he did towards Carson that was no excuse he made me want to punch him in the balls for treating her that way. There was so much going on in this book that captured me from the beginning! Action, romance, drama, and suspense! All of it combined made for a really great read."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416587-kim", "userReview": "I received this book as a giveaway but the review is 100% mine. I must admit I was a little turned off by the cover. But the draw? \"A post-apocalyptic zombie book for women. Without the zombies.\"It had me. Curiosity filled me. I'm not usually a fan of zombie books so I wasn't expecting too much but I was pleasantly surprised. The writing was smooth and the plot kept me intrigued. As a wife and mother I connected with Carson, I understood her feelings and her willingness to do anything to protect her child. Especially after witnessing her husbands murder. I like how each chapter starts out as a reminiscing of her life before the virus. Her life with Ritchie. It really gives depth to her character. The book starts off quick. I thought the whole thing would be full of just crazy zombie decapitation but it wasn't. (Don't worry, There is plenty thanks to our heroines fierce katana skills) But I really liked how they found a way to build their own little town and means for survival and how they formed new bonds and relationships. There was a lead, perhaps a possible sequel? It was a fast paced enjoyable read and I will definitely keep an eye on this author in the future. There is language, sometimes very strong, sex, rape and murder."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14440581-rebecca", "userReview": "I'm not really into the pop culture fads around zombies and vampires, but I was hoping this book would be different and I was right! It really is a zombie book that isn't all about zombies. I was drawn in from the beginning and had a hard time putting the book down because I was so interested in the plot twists and turns.I would classify it as a post apocalyptic or dystopian novel. A \"demon virus\" has wiped out most of the human race, and the \"homicidals\" who survived are mostly genetically immune, although many survivors have been killed by the infected. The virus doesn't turn people into zombies, but it gradually destroys them as they try to kill any survivors they meet. The protagonist, Carson, loses her husband to a horde of homicidals. She takes the RV he bought and their son and drives from Oregon to Tennessee to her childhood home, fighting homicidals and looting homes for necessities along the way. Carson's character was very well developed and I could relate to her. Imagining the world without electricity, radio communication, television or internet or indeed other people is just scary, so I admired Carson for her strength and ability to stay grounded. I also liked how the book ended, but I don't want to spoil any more of the story. Just read it!"}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9850325-judy", "userReview": "My Review: The virus that kills off the majority of the population within a number of days is bad enough but the ones that don\u2019t die right away is where the real horror lies. Turned into homicidals with one desire to kill the uninfected anyway possible you can do two things run or fight. Carson after loosing her husband to a pack of the monsters chooses to fight to protect her young son. Her weapon of choice is two Katana swords. The choice of weapons in this book is one of the best ideas, loved it. I have to say this is one of the best post-apocalyptic books I have ran across. The action is great and the relationships between the survivors is masterful. The obstacles that they face are believable and the solutions unique. A reader gets totally wrapped up in the story and cares deeply for the characters. I consider this a must read for the lovers of TEOTWAWKI stories.The book is well written and edited I found no continuity problems in the book . I would re-read it just to absorb what I might have missed in the first go around. This book gets 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Kate Hearn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17213972-kate-hearn", "userReview": "***I WON THIS BOOK IN A GOODREADS GIVEAWAY***I loved this book! I seriously didn't want to put it down, but needed to sleep at some point. If you enjoy post apocalyptic style books where much of the population has been killed off by a deadly virus, and some have changed (think zombie, only smarter), this book is for you. As I was reading I kept thinking, this would make an awesome movie. I had no problem visualizing the scenes, and felt as if I was actually witnessing the events as if I were there. It creeps me out to think something like this could happen, and that keeps me reading. Homicidals, way more intense than zombiesI thought Carson was kickass. Very likeable character, as many of her actions are with her son in mind...keeping him safe. As a mother of a young son I could totally relate to that, I would do anything to keep him safe, I just wish I knew how to rock the katana.This book easily makes it onto my favorites shelf...will read it again."}, {"userName": "Somekindofnobody", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/135885-somekindofnobody", "userReview": "The book focus's (in my opinion) on how relationships form under duress of the human condition and maybe more than that. Rather than a typical zombie, post-apocalyptica book you find characters foraging for emotional maturity and emotional strength comfort while trying to find one's own soul when blackness is all around you.It's a story of the human condition and I found it well written and most absolutely entertaining. I once watched a movie called Memento and it was a twisty-curvy tale such as this so you will have to have your sensitive side handy as well as your handlebars for the thrill and don't forget the seat-belt to strap yourself in from putting this book down and getting up.Highly recommend. Its a genre-buster as I don't know how to categorize this. SciFi/Romance/Thriller/Paranormal/Occult/YourNameHere...it's an excellent read and worth your time.Flows well, good editing and highly entertaining."}, {"userName": "Mary Hartshorn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13314817-mary-hartshorn", "userReview": "This was a surprisingly great book with a very strong female character who knows how to whip out some katanas! I gotta admit there were parts that I did not like but then again it would not be a good book if the author did not evoke some emotions from you. Wow is all I can say. I could not imagine how I would react in a situation like this, but there was a scene in particular that I could say I would act differently. With your child being your most precious possession why would you trust him with a proven coward far away from you?

I think that it could of comfortably been a trilogy of novels with the onset of the virus, the road journey, and the new colony. As it is in places the story seems to jump around a bit and there is not the room for the full development of the characters who at times seem a little one dimensional. Apart from that its a good sory well written and I did enjoy it. Maybe theres room for a sequel."}, {"userName": "Wheezy Hardin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20028531-wheezy-hardin", "userReview": "This book took me a while to get through, but it was one that I wanted to absorb instead of just quick read. I LOVE a good zombie book, this was more. It brought forth the hope after the epidemic, the love of a mother, and the idea that she had the strength to push herself when she felt her life was gone.

I found it a bit too fangirl for a particular character in Walking Dead, but nonetheless it is likely a good introduction to post-apocalyptic zombie fiction for the casual reader. I could have used more meat in the moral implications of different actions that the main character & the two love interests take- there don't seem to many shades of grey offered. The romance was a bit confusing/disjointed- having a hard time relating to the motivations and emotional jumps that come up. I don't want to get too detailed, as resolving the triangle is one of the major conflicts in the book.I received a free copy of the book in exchange for my independent review."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3348173-tiffany", "userReview": "A solid story in this genre.
