This allegorical tale of a 15-year-old girl wandering a barren wasteland should not be beautiful, because she's fighting off zombies and a guy who's dead set on executing her. But it is. The writing is lush and gorgeous, the kind that makes you want to sink down and roll around in it until some small part of it is absorbed into your skin. *******************************************************Excerpt:It was deep night when she saw it, but the moon was so bright it cast hard shadows everywhere on the island...a school of tiny fish, all darting around like marbles in a chalk circle, and they were lit up electric, mostly silver but some gold and pink too. They came and danced around her ankles, and she could feel their little electric fish bodies, and it was like she was standing under the moon and in the moon at the same time.*******************************************************And that is just the first page. Six pages later, Temple stands over a zombie on a beach and crushes its skull with a huge rock. This author does not spare the terrible violence of encounters with the undead, and each confrontation is absolutely brutal and wince-inducing in its savagery. But there are some things you just have to do in order to survive.Temple is also one of the most unforgettable fictional characters I've ever come across. She is bold, fiercely independent, and terribly damaged. Left on her own by an infected uncle and parents she doesn't remember, she encounters all kinds of people in her travels: a commune of frightened survivors, a group of men who have resorted to creative ways of finding food, a band of vicious mutants, a pitifully tragic family wasting away in their elegant manor, and a mute, helpless man she takes on against her better judgment. And of course, there's also the guy who's tracking her, hell-bent on justice because she dared to kill his brother in self-defense. It's an interesting situation when you have to fear both the living and the undead...as well as the mistakes you've made in your past.This is a fairly short novel that is written almost like a post-apocalyptic western, but it is one that is packed with incredible power. It's been a few days since I finished reading this book, and I can't seem to forget the bleak intensity and magnificence of its imagery. I suspect that I never will."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "book two of \"october is zombie month\" was so much better than book one. sooo much better. i was intrigued by this book, until i read mike reynolds' devastatingly negative review of it, and it got shunted to the mental back burner. but eventually i remembered that i am not as smart as mike reynolds, and i am content with playing with little glass paperweights refracting in the sunlight while giggling, so i read it. and i loved it. (see, pretty!)but it's good - i lovingly thumb my nose at the negative reviews. and then duck.this isn't a YA novel, although many people on this site have decided it is. and that's fair - the protagonist is fifteen, and the pacing matches that of a YA novel. but my barnes and noble overlord classifies it as adult, and we all know they would never make a classification error. so let's call it an adult novel so as not to scare off the old stuffy types, and the rest of you, i will just \"shh, yeah, i know.\" and i have to admit, i have only read one flannery o'connor book (for shame!!) although i have seen wise blood because, well, duh:but so as far as the \"derivative\" accusations go, i am as clean-wooled as a baby lamb. but i plan on reading more of her soon, i swear.this is basically the kind of book i love - the gothic-western justice-novel, but with some supernatural spice. it is more or less true grit with zombies. temple speechifies in roughly the same biblical manner - with a mixture of retributive old testament and a soft sticky center of love thy (deserving) neighbor, jesus-style; a mixture of poor grammar and poetic resonance. i love her character. she is eminently capable, running from her past and her mistakes which haunt her way more than any slow-shambling zombies, which act more as set-pieces than as any real threat.it is fairly episodic, and the basic theme is about the path to forgiveness and redemption, and the progression of that kind of grieving, healing process, but let's not forget, there are also zombies, so it isn't all whiny mitch albom stuff.what is great about this book is that temple was born into this world. she has never known a world without desolation, without monsters, without danger or the necessity of moving on. she is unattached and detached, but retains some inherent glimmer of humanity that constitutes her own moral compass. and it is gorgeous to watch a girl operate under the weight of her guilt and the necessity of her survival instincts. she does not take any shit, but she is not without empathy. nor without understanding of other people's personal moral code, even as it works against her. also great is that, starting the way this one does, in the waning years of an infestation, we do not have to read any boring scenes where people have a slow dawning realization of the situation. we are thrust into a world that is, not that is becoming.i love it i love it i love it.it is exactly what i needed to be reading - a \"horror\" novel that has more depth than just \"braaaaains,\" one one whose themes are smack in my area of interest. plus, tom franklin (my new love in life) blurbed this puppy. and it turns out, this guy is married to megan abbott, who i have been meaning to read for forever."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of thewicked one;The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is theend of the world; and the reapers are the angels.As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire;so shall it be the end of this world.\nThere are people who are not going to read this book just because they don\u2019t read books with zombies. They may not read it because it is horror, fearing that they will be exposed to graphic violence or maybe they won\u2019t read it because it is about a fifteen year old girl; and frankly, teenagers are annoying. Whatever reason you might be thinking about using for why you are not going to read this book...well...put that thought on a back burner.The book does have zombies called slugs. It does feature a fifteen year old girl; and yes, some people have found her Southern voice annoying, but what they miss when they say that is the absolute authenticity that comes through in every sentence and every paragraph. I\u2019m not sure how a girl that can\u2019t read who has never been educated except with on-the-job-of-living survival skills is supposed to talk. She colors her words with wisdom, self reflection, pain, and dogged truth. She has an undisciplined mind, honed by fire, bristling with desire to see the world, and experience what others are too afraid to try. She is Temple. She is Sarah Mary. See, there\u2019s music in the world and you got to be listening otherwise you\u2019ll miss it sure. Like when the she comes out of the house and the night-time air feels dreamy-cold on her face and it smells like the pureness of a fresh land just started. Like it was something old and dusty and broken, taken off the shelf to make room for something sparkle-new. And it\u2019s your soul desiring to move and be a part of it, whatever it is, to be out there on the soot plains where the living fall and the dead rise, and the dead fall and the living rise, like the cycle of life.The apocalypse happened twenty-five years ago so Temple was born after the world went to hell. She is of this world, and is not encumbered with memories of a life before of manicured lawns, bicycle paths, going to school, hanging out with friends, family dinners, or watching television. Unencumbered that is until she meets Maury. She calls him dummy because he doesn\u2019t talk or show that much at all is being processed through his brain. She has thoughts of dumping him off at the first available moment, but then he shows her a slip a paper that was balled up in his pocket. \nHello! My name is Maury and I wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly.My grandmother loves me and wishes she could takecare of me for ever, but she\u2019s most likely gone now.I have family out west. If you find me, will you take me to them? God bless you!Jeb and Jennie Duchamp442 Hamilton StreetPoint Comfort, TX\nTemple carries her own burdens of failure and getting Maury back to his family becomes a quest that she feels will lift some of the blood from her soul. She doesn\u2019t really understand it, but feels in the doing maybe she will.She has made enemies and one in particular keeps finding her like an angel of death. She can\u2019t shake him. He is Moses Todd.My gut tells me that\u2019s my old friend Moses Todd, who\u2019s got some business he\u2019s gonna want to finish up with me. It\u2019s a wonder how he\u2019s trackin me, but you can\u2019t put nothin past these southern boys. They just sit around waiting for somebody to kill their brother so they can get started on some vengeance. It\u2019s like a dang vocation with them.Temple finds moments of sanctuary, but knows, like a clock in her head keeping time, that she needs to keep moving or she will be found. She is nervous living in safety, walled away from slugs, but also from the wide open space of her world. Her feet start to itch and windows are reminders of what lies beyond.She wonders how people can live this kind of life, trapped inside a house with windows everywhere showing you where else you could be.Slugs are just a part of her world. They aren\u2019t evil. Even men who find her attractive are but another component of her world that she is prepared to deal with. She does fear that there is evil inside of her. A darkness that comes out when she fights, when compassion disappears, and she is inflicting death as casually as a middle aged man at a lunch counter smacking flies with a flyswatter. In a scene that could have been lifted from a Cormac McCarthy novel she emerges victorious, but stained deeper than skin deep.Amid the hot stench of fresh offal, she rises to her feet like the dreadful ghost of a fallen battlefield soldier, her hands tacky with the thick pulpy dregs of death splayed wide. The echoes of the clamour having died on the puddled ground, the only sound in the room is the thin insectoid buzzing of the three exposed bulbs suspended in ceramic sockets from the ceiling.Even the imprisoned slugs themselves have paused in their perpetual movement to gaze with acquiescent eyes upon the scene of the massacre, as though in harmony with the inexorable and silent melodies of grim decease--as though in deferential recognition of the community of the extinct.She rises to her feet and blinks, her eyes like bleached wafers set against the brown mizzle of blood already drying in flakes on her cheeks and lips and neck. She raises no hand to cleanse herself, marked as she is with a violence, ritualist and primitive, like those hunters who would decorate themselves with the ornamental residuum of their prey.In a scene that is reminiscent of something out of a William Faulkner novel she is talking to an acquaintance who is trying to tempt her to go to California with him where things are rumored to be almost normal. You get old, Temple. The wide world is a pretty adventure for a long time, it\u2019s true. But then one day you wake up and you just want to drink a cup of coffee without thinking about livin or dyin.Yeah, well, I ain\u2019t there yet.Goddamnit, girl, what happened to you? You got things to tell. You could tell me.Maybe so, she says. But I ain\u2019t there yet either.There is a reason why Alden Bell\u2019s writing is being compared to other accomplished writers because he wrote a great book full of wonderful introspection, a character to rival Katniss Everdeen for cunning and survival skill, and a plot that kept me turning pages long after my family had nestled down to sleep. Bell is married to Megan Abbott, a lauded writer in her own right. There is magic to the way he played with me in this one. He had me dangling from his fingertips, my mind churning and rippling with anxiety, and the air crackled with the burnt rubber smell of fear.Highly Recommended!If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "I just finished reading probably a couple of dozens of the book's reviews and feel like there is hardly anything left to add. Except maybe that The Reapers Are the Angels is one of the very few zombie books I have ever finished and pretty much the only zombie book that I finished with pleasure and emotional involvement. Most likely because this novel isn't really about zombies. It is about us, people, whose conscience (and not external circumstances) often is our most dangerous and relentless enemy. In The Road-like fashion (I have to say, Alden Bell was undoubtedly very heavily and obviously inspired by Cormac McCarthy's works), the post-apocalyptic setting is nothing but a backdrop for exploring the matters of human soul. Bell doesn't dwell on detailing his world, and correctly so. Some authors (Lauren DeStefano in Wither, for instance) make a mistake of over-explaining things when they don't need to. And Bell doesn't need to tell us how this zombie business works. Because for his main character, 15-year old Temple, zombies are the least of her problems. For Temple, they are a part of the natural environment, like, let's say, animals. Survival in this infested world is easy, dealing with what is inside her mind and heart - guilt, doubt, loneliness - that is hard.Others have already said it, Temple is the one who carries this novel. She is a remarkably well realized character. She is self-sufficient, strong, capable, caring, and honorable, but with a gaping hole in her soul. I dare you not to empathize with her and her search for self-forgiveness and sense of belonging. Does she find it? I wished for a different ending, I won't lie. There are still some lingering questions that I haven't found the answers to, even after reading other reviewers' opinions about the novel. I never quite understood the main antagonist, Moses. Is he another lost soul looking for a purpose and who finds a very strange one? His vendetta is so... pointless. Your thoughts are very welcome."}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "I had this crazy dream about zombies the other night. I can\u2019t remember a goddamn thing about it now, and the aftermath is a little fuzzy, but apparently when I woke up I was convinced that they were in the house, because I shot straight up in bed and screamed, \u201cTHEY\u2019RE COMING UP THE STAIRS!\u201d My fianc\u00e9 had no idea that I\u2019d been dreaming and thought that someone had broken into the house. Chaos ensued. Now before you go thinking, \u201cOh that poor man\u201d let me tell you that this is rare for me. Like maybe once every three years do I do something like this. He does this shit to me all the time. Four months ago, I was up late reading, and his eyes flashed open. His hand closed around my wrist in a vice-like grip, and he looked me straight in the eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m drawing a circle and a what the fuck.\u201dUm\u2026wut? I tried to get him to explain himself, but all he said was, \u201cIt\u2019s important, don\u2019t ever forget it, Navessa\u201d. He promptly fell back asleep. When he woke up, he had no recollection of it. Great. Just fucking wonderful. So now it\u2019s four months later, and that memory is seared into my consciousness. I blame M. Night Shyamalan. What if it is important? What if, in some way, that midnight utterance is the key to saving the human race from an alien invasion? Reading this book is a lot like dreaming. You\u2019re thrown into the middle of it with no warning, given no information on how you got there, and are forced to suck it up and deal with it the best you can. It\u2019s gorgeous, horrific, uplifting, and disturbing. And when it\u2019s over, it lingers with you, leaves you unsettled and questioning the meaning of it all.

Not that there isn\u2019t violence or zombies, it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t overpower the story. Without family or a place to live, 15-year-old Temple wanders around a bleak and barren landscape ravaged by zombies. Many of the human survivors live in groups, sheltering themselves from the outside world. Nothing is mentioned about how the zombies came to be, but that\u2019s OK. This is not their story, after all. This is a story about Temple, her grief, the things she must do to survive, her thoughts and reflections, her loneliness, her self-loathing, the people she meets, and the beauty that can be found in such grim circumstances.

Some of them I forgot almost instantly. Others I need to be reminded of and even then remember only faintly. Then there are some I remember clearly because a part of them was important to me. But there is also a very small number of characters that stay with me always, characters that follow me around like shadows... shadows that once taught me an important lesson I'll never forget. One of them is Stephen King's Dolores Claiborne. Alden Bell's Temple is another. This woman, this young girl, this child, is sixteen characters folded into one, and yet on the surface she is as simple as a girl can be. She is a character that makes your heart ache and your head spin. She is someone you have no choice but to love... someone you'll do your best to understand... someone you'll always want to be. At first I was expecting a paranormal YA novel... I didn't read any of the reviews and I guess I just made a stupid assumption. Temple IS fifteen years old and the book really HAS zombies, but that's where the similarities with all the novels we usually read end. The Reapers Are the Angels is NOT a YA novel! It's post-apocalyptic fiction at its best. Actually, it's not a novel that people under the age of 18 should read. It has violence, sex and more violence and it's scary and horrible at times. But it is also wonderful and deep and mature and not to be taken lightly at all. The psychological developement of Bell's characters is astonishing, almost incredible. If you have a strong stomach and you want to take a break from all the predictable fiction that surrounds us, The Reapers Are the Angels might be the novel for you. It doesn't follow any rules, it will make you skip dinner, and it will definitely make you cry. But most of all, it will surprise you with its simplicity and its depth and it will probably teach you a thing or two about yourself... and about who you want to be when world as we know it comes to an end. ------------------------------------------Alden Bell's gorgeously written and bloody tale, which mutates from a zombie story into something of beauty and meaning. . . . Bell clearly owes great literary debt to Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\" and the Southern Gothic school of Faulkner and O'Connor, but The Reapers Are the Angels shows the reader that they need not settle for mere blood 'n' guts when horror tales can, and should, go many extra miles.\u2014Sarah Weinman, Summer Reading Pick, Salon.com"}, {"userName": "Carol.

The section where she is in a safety town and goes on a 'date' is particularly touching.Then there is the ending, a complete kick in the head. While I don't feel it changed the essential message of the book, it did highlight the limits of our ability to control the world.

She\u2019s only 15 and has killed many the rule is kill or be killed. A desolate land of death and zombies, she did not choose this destiny. Amongst the contagious spreading of zombies, she hides from many in the shadows and is well equipped to fight twice her size equipped with her Gurkha knife. This story is written well, a story so bleak about death and survival and love has some beautifully written lines, written in eloquent prose that makes the zombie story that so much better.The story is about death and redemption and one girl\u2019s eventual outcome amongst so much darkness, at times heart-breaking.The island, The Lighthouse, The Moon and The Miracle of the Fish.\"And, too, a carnival of death, a grassy park near the city center, a merry-go-round that turns unceasing hour by hour, its old-time calliope breathing out dented and rusty notes while the slugs pull their own arms out of the sockets trying to climb aboard the moving platform, some disembodied limbs dragging in the dirt around and around, hands still gripping the metal poles\u2014and the ones who succeed and climb aboard, mounting to the top of the wooden horses, joining with the endless motion of the machine, dazed to imbecility by gut memories of speed and human ingenuity. And the horde, in the blackout of the city night, illumined only by the headlights of the car, everywhere descending and roiling against one another like maggots in the belly of a dead cat, the grimmest and most degenerate manifestation this blighted humanity on this blighted earth\u2014beasts of our lost pasts, spilling out of whatever hell we have made for them like the army of the damned, choked and gagging and rotted and crusty and eminently pathetic, yes, brutally, conspicuously, outrageously pathetic.\"\nThe Books Behind The Reapers Are The AngelsAs I suspect is true of all novels, The Reapers Are the Angels is cobbled together from the fragments of other books. Any but the most passive reader will collect certain baggage from the books he or she reads\u2014lingering impressions that stick like burrs in the back of the brain and sometimes, especially if the reader is also a writer, plant themselves in the imagination like seeds that grow into other books entirely. For me, these influences can range from a narrative style that I wish I could emulate, to an unforgettable scene, or a perfectly written sentence, or even an ideally chosen and placed word (like the word \"thrapple\" in Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian). For a writer, those are the things that brought you to literature in the first place\u2014a fascination with artful storytelling\u2014so it's not surprising that the things you admire most make their way in sometimes insidious ways into your own writing.I've heard this process referred to in a number of ways: everything from plagiarism to artful thievery to homage. But I think I like Tolstoy's metaphor best: art is a contagion. It infects you with its brilliance, and you feel inspired, however humbly, to recreate it and infect somebody else with it.Even though it is, without question, a zombie novel, Reapers traces the source of its literary infection back to the Southern Gothic tradition and the classic stories of the American frontier. Here are some of the contagious books that have contributed to The Reapers Are the Angels.The Sound and the Fury, William Faulkner. The more I write, the more I find myself in debt to Faulkner. The unquestionable master of the Southern Gothic, Faulkner is an icon for writers because he is unafraid to go big: he does not hesitate to launch into epic considerations of good and evil, womanhood and manhood, sin and corruption, nobility and redemption. You could accuse him of being melodramatic, but in an age when so many books seem to be written in a snickering, self-deprecatory style, I personally would rather see someone err in the direction of grandiosity rather than modesty. Some small homages to Faulkner in Reapers: Temple's name, which comes from Sanctuary, and the figure of Maury, who is based upon Benjy in The Sound and the Fury. Also, the Grierson episode evokes the short story \"A Rose for Emily,\" about a woman (Emily Grierson) who refuses to make the transition from the past to the present.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain. Reapers is structured as a classic American road novel, the form of which has its roots in Huck Finn. It is episodic, and we are drawn forward by an overdetermination of motives: an escape from whatever imprisonment is behind the hero and a pursuit of whatever freedom lies before the hero. Temple is, I think, a version of the pragmatic, earnest Huck Finn. The pseudonym she uses, Sarah Mary Williams, is the same one Huck Finn himself uses when he dressed up as a girl.Blood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy. For my money, this is one of the great American books of the second half of the twentieth century. Its storyline makes it more of a Western, but its style is pure Southern Gothic. The primary conflict is between an unnamed \"kid\" and a man who seems echo the expansive, chatty evil of a Faustian devil. I think my character Moses is a kinder, gentler version of that antagonist. In addition, a number of the scenes of vast violence in Reapers are inspired by those from Blood Meridian, particularly the infamous Comanche attack scene.Their Eyes Were Watching God, Zora Neale Hurston. You wouldn't normally associate Hurston's lovely, poetic, romantic novel with zombies\u2014but she does tap into a folkloric kind of mysticism that has always fascinated me. My term for zombies, \"meatskins,\" actually comes from Hurston, but she uses it simply to describe puny human beings: \"meatskins dancing around the toes of time.\"Winter's Bone by Daniel Woodrell and Smonk by Tom Franklin. These are two masters of the contemporary Southern Gothic genre. My character of Temple is inspired by the tough, relentless heroines of these two novels. Both of these authors create teenage girls who have managed to survive in brutal surroundings, who have actually grown accustomed to violence and corruption. But what both these authors admire about their characters (you can feel it in the affectionate way they write about them), is their ability to maintain a certain purity within their own individual codes. These girls survive because, even though they live on the rough and tumble margins of society, they are driven by a personal idealism that tells them what to do.And it would be remiss of me not to mention two television shows that have contributed a great deal to Reapers: Deadwood, which is the perfect representation of a violent, blustery, and wholly beautiful frontier lifestyle, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which represents a landmark in tough, intelligent, complicated and sympathetic young female protagonists.Alden Bell's Top Ten Zombie Movies10. I Walked with a ZombieJacques Tourneur's 1943 classic illustrates the voodoo roots of zombie mythology. The stiff melodrama of this film fits perfectly with the hypnotic movements of the zombies themselves and the decaying gothic sensibility of the setting. This is a different kind of zombie: there are no half-rotted walking corpses here\u2014only haunted figures wandering in authentically creepy trances.9. 28 Days LaterThis seems to be the movie that changed the genre. Suddenly zombies were driven by fury more than hunger, and they ran after you with surprising athleticism rather than loping with a stiff, corpse-like gait. Personally, I'm a fan of the more traditional slow zombies, but I admire this movie for the way it uses the zombie backdrop to portray a very gritty story of human frailty.8. Night of the Living DeadWhat George Romero did with this movie was show that zombies make a marvelously accommodating metaphor for whatever political, social or philosophical point you want to make. He shows us that modern zombie stories aren't, for the most part, about zombies\u2014which is beautifully illustrated by the opening scene where the zombie doesn't jump out at you but lingers, unfocussed, in the background for quite a while.7. ZombielandI love this movie partly because it is reminiscent of Dawn of the Dead in its playful fascination with post-apocalyptic landscapes but also because it features a cast of characters all of whom have already learned to be survivors. Whether through brutality or trickery or avoidance, these characters have learned to live in the midst of a zombie infestation\u2014and their masterful handling of a blighted world is deeply satisfying to watch.6. Evil Dead 2: Dead by DawnI have no excuse for this one. I saw it as a kid and thought it was the height of wit. How could the movie be so irreverent to something as deadly serious as flesh-eating zombies? It was my Noel Coward. As a teenager, I had the movie poster fixed permanently above my bed. A grinning skull gazing at you with a sly sideways glance.5. American ZombieA brilliant faux documentary about the marginalized population of zombies living on the fringes of Los Angeles. This movie does more than any other to humanize zombies\u2014even turning them into an oppressed yet articulate minority. Understated and surprisingly touching.4. Re-AnimatorI don't know if this exactly qualifies as a zombie movie, but I love it anyway. It delights in its perverse grossness, and it hearkens back (in a mostly sincere way, despite the number of viewers who like to see it as campy) to old fashioned mad scientist tales.3. Cemetery ManThis underrated 1994 movie, featuring Rupert Everett as a cemetery keeper who has a problem with the dead returning to life, has some of the most wonderfully absurd incarnations of zombie mythology, including a troop of zombie boy scouts, a zombie motorcyclist, and a zombie bride who is no more than a head. Plus, it features the classic line, uttered by the vivacious Anna Fulchi, \u201cYou know, you've got a real nice ossuary.\u201d Yes, the movie wants to be a hundred different movies at once. Yes, the special effects are clumsy and the humor broad. But, curiously enough, it's also a deeply cerebral study of life circumscribed by death.2. Dead Alive (also called Braindead)When this first came out, it was lauded as the most gory movie every made. I don't know how such things are measured, but it would certainly take some effort to find a movie more stomach-churning than this one. Priding itself on bizarre dark humor and innovative ways to be killed, the movie is great because of its unabashed Freudian subplot. Leave it to Peter Jackson to combine a zombie slaughter-fest with the psychological trauma of a severe Oedipal complex.1. Dawn of the DeadFor me, this is the archetype, this is where it all began. I remember watching it in complete wonder at all the curious reversals: the portrayal of the zombies as sad and rather pathetic background figures, the fixation on the technical logistics of survival (how much time is spent on showing how the survivors fortify and clean up that shopping mall?), the implication that humans are a far greater threat than zombies, the lack of a beginning or ending (the feeling that the movie is all middle), the portrayal of the loneliness and boredom and downright normalization of life in a post-apocalyptic world. And this, ultimately, is what makes the film so unique: where other movies in the genre do everything in their power to show how different and strange the zombie apocalypse is, Romero focuses on how familiar it Can be.http://more2read.com/?review=the-reapers-are-the-angels-by-alden-bell"}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "[ Normally, I rage when a MC is killed off, but this book was so good, I can forgive it.

The plot is inspired, but its butchered by piss poor authorship & the biggest fuck up of an editor on the planet! It makes the book not even worth the paper that you wipe your butt with!25 years AFTER the zombies rise we still have electricity, Coke, ice, power enough to run elevators, & plenty of gasoline.Diesel engines still cross the country. The power grids are all still intact, apparently humans don't need to like, SERVICE the machinery of power or anything! Hell, even electronic \"tracking devices\" still work when applied to cars, as do their receivers! Entire cities stand untouched, minus minor water damage and some lawns gone shaggy, the dead just mill around doing no damage to anything nor did those who died damage anything or even those fleeing the onslaught of the dead. Oh, lets not forget the dust - made up of 90% human skin & very little humans to shed it but there's dust.Apparently EVERY weather factor on the planet ceases. No hurricanes, Houston is pristine minus some garbage in the gutter (like I said, pristine). No tornadoes, no major damage to roads. A few collapsed overpasses is about all the damage to the US infrastructure in 25 years of the undead & humanity surviving in only small pockets. No floods, the US Gulf coast is near to untouched, if abandoned.The sun sets in the East! Apparently its an alternate reality in which an editor of a book can't be fucking bothered to actually READ the shit they're putting their name on. Anymore so than the author can be expected to do anything other than talk about lobsterized human-zombie hybrids, made by distilling zombie brain gunk & shooting up, who happen to be inbreed hicks! It seems the most incontrovertible facts of nature - the sun rises in the East & sets in the West, no longer apply!The rich live in opulent homes & apparently grow their own mustard plants & produce their own mustard, in addition to so many other things from civilization. Let's not miss the booze that's only 6 years old! They must be distilling their own alcohol too!No one actually SPEAKS in this book. They apparently all use mental speech as there is not ONE DAMN QUOTATION MARK around one single, solitary fucking conversation! A total & complete butchery of the English language. If this is the shit that got published, dear gods I don't want to see the 'manuscript', its probably a bigger steaming pile of shit than this book!I've read some crappy zombie books.

And isn't Temple looking for a promised land herself? To me, this is what Moses symbolizes in the story; he is person who is leading Temple towards her destiny, who is going, eventually, to save her from herself. Temple's inability to find a place in life derives from her inability to forgive herself for her role in her brother's death. Her quest is pointless in the sense that she is running from herself. Temple, coincidentally, also kills Moses' brother. You can see then how Moses, on another level, becomes a personification of Temple's conscience, from which she runs away but that she never quite manages to outrun and with which, at the end, she has to deal.Temple will never be able to forgive herself for her brother and her promised land, her peace of mind, can be nothing but death.

It was a fortunate choice and I can only hope I enjoy other forays into the genre as much. One thing I can say is that it\u2019s definitely a real page-turner . The story of Temple, the young bad-ass action-grrl born into a world after the rise of the undead, is compelling and engrossing and has definitely got velocity. Temple herself is interesting, a strangely positive girl despite the darkness of her past and the violence of both her world and her deeper character. She's a strange oxymoron, an optimist who seethes under the surface with supressed rage. I suppose she could be seen as yet another product of the Buffy/Katniss/whatever-action-grrl-of-the-moment template, but I thought she generally came across as being much more real than that stereotype would imply. She may be a warrior princess of sorts, but Temple has a certain na\u00efve charm that sets her apart and she rarely goes looking for trouble, though of course it often finds her. Temple is also interesting in that she was born into the world of the apocalypse, so the status quo doesn\u2019t disturb her in the same way as it does the survivors from the old time. She doesn\u2019t see the world as a punishment and a curse, but rather as a gift. She sees the hand of God in everything and even the fact of the shambling dead is a miracle when you look at it from the right angle. It\u2019s an interesting perspective however off-the-wall it might seem.The other major element of the novel is its prose. The southern twang that nearly drips off the page is a joy to read and makes the novel seem, on the one hand, very literary. Yet there was another element to it that kept breaking through in the back of my mind and which occasionally broke the spell of the prose itself: this is also a novel that very much reads as though it were written with the cinematic version strongly in mind. At times it is almost like a movie treatment for the soon-to-be-produced vehicle starring the next Jennifer Lawrence as Temple (maybe Chloe Moretz? She\u2019s young enough and certainly her stint as Hitgirl in \u2018Kickass\u2019 gives her some of the required experience in extreme violence). This isn\u2019t exactly a bad thing, I guess, and the author is welcome to any income he can derive from his work, but it was a little distracting sometimes to think \u201cah yes, I can just see the dollar signs in the author\u2019s eyes as he wrote this scene just for the big screen.\u201d Unfair of me maybe, I don\u2019t know, but it was a feeling I definitely got from time to time while reading. That said, this is still a great novel to read and it\u2019s simply filled with the poetic palaver of the South so mellifluous to Northern ears.Aside from being both a quest road-trip and the story of a young girl (who\u2019s really more of an adult in all but the most literal temporal sense) coping with her past as she faces her future it is also, as others have pointed out, definitely a story about the American landscape. It\u2019s a blasted and decayed landscape, but one where the character of its past still shines through in what remains. Ironically it seems to be those who are most willing to let go of this geographical memory that are most likely to succeed in this new world as opposed to the hopeless dreamers trying to claw their way back to the world of civilization and who pretend that their little enclaves of the old world are anything other than a fantasy.I\u2019ll conclude by saying that Alden Bell also did a great job of building up his characters and even those who had little more than a walk-on were generally interesting and unique. A shout-out has to go to Moses Todd one of the better villains (or perhaps I really ought to call him an antagonist) I\u2019ve come across in awhile. He\u2019s nearly as compelling as Temple and seeing the two of them together was nearly always a treat. I\u2019m surprised to see this listed as book one in a series, but I\u2019m willing to go along with Bell in his further forays across the twisted landscape of undead America.Also posted at Shelf Inflicted"}, {"userName": "Michelle, the Bookshelf Stalker  Queen of the Undead", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3039709-michelle-the-bookshelf-stalker-queen-of-the-undead", "userReview": "AH and Regina did an excellent review of this book here...http://badassbookreviews.com/review-t...or you can read my much less exciting review below...4.5 stars out of 5If you could take all the strong, fearless, intelligent, compassionate female characters from all the books you have read, you'll come close to Temple's character.If you take all the screwed up, guilt ridden, angry, sad female characters from the books you have read, you'll come close to Temple's character.Temple will go down as one of the most memorable characters I've had the pleasure reading about in a long time.The zombies, the adventure across the country, is just the setting for the reader to meet and love Temple. It is a good thing too since there is alot wrong with the world building in this book. In fact, there is none. Why are the shelves still stocked with plenty of food? How is there still gas? How are the trains running? What caused people to turn into zombies? And so on and so on. Even with the lack of world building, the book was incredible!There is an incredible set of minor characters in the book as well. I fell hard for Maury. A wordless man that spoke volumes about love, compassion and gentleness.Oh and one more annoying point- There are no quotation marks. I'm not sure why, but not one quotation mark.

I have to admit that The Walking Dead probably has been a large part of my new found love of all things zombies. When this book came across my feed on Goodreads, I just know that I was going to have to read it. Everyone seemed to absolutely love it and I just knew that I was in for a treat. I liked this book well enough but it didn't turn out to nearly as good as I had been expecting. It may very well be a case of going into a book with unrealistic expectations.There was a lot that I really did like about this book. It was a really fast and rather exciting read. I liked the fact that this story had a teenager as the main character and romance was not the key point in the story. That gets a few bonus points right away in my book. The world that it was set in was really well thought out. I really liked the fact that Temple, the main character, has never known a world different than the one she is in. She takes things as they are and is able to adapt really quickly to just about any situation. Temple was a wonderfully written character.Another thing that I really enjoyed in this story was the fact that it took place in so many vivid locations. Every single one of the places that Temple finds herself in during the course of the story is unique. I would expect that in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, there would be a lot of different ways to deal with the situation evolving. I thought that every single environment that was a part of the story seemed very authentic.Unfortunately, there were a few things that didn't work very well for me. This book was depressing. I don't know why I expected a zombie apocalypse book to be anything but depressing but I have to admit that I did. When I finished this book, I kind of wanted to curl up into a ball and just be left alone. If that was what the author was trying to do with the story, he did a great job but that's just not the kind of book that I enjoy reading. I also didn't care for the way that Temple addressed the man who she ending up bring with her during the bulk of the book. I understand that Temple has had to make it on her own in this scary world so I am sure that little lessons like treating others with respect were not covered but I can't help but cringe anytime I see a passage where someone with a disability is not treated with respect. That was a major turn off for me with this book. All in all I would probably recommend this book to others. It is a different take on the zombie idea that is able to keep things interesting. This is the first book by Alden Bell that I have read but I would pick up another one of his books in the future. I did notice that there is at least one more book in this series but to be honest I am not sure if I am going to pick that one up or not right now. Initial ThoughtsI liked this one but not nearly as much as I had hoped. This book's ending was incredibly depressing for me.

It\u2019s original and it stands apart from the ravenous mobs of zombie novels published recently. The main character has a very well developed point of view that I haven\u2019t seen before, and the ending left my mind reeling with possibilities.The opening of the story seems beautiful, almost idyllic. Temple has found a sanctuary in an island lighthouse, where she goes through the daily chores of survival, but takes time to marvel at small miracles. The dream seems shattered when a \u201cslug\u201d washes up on shore, half dead but a sure harbinger of more zombies to come. Temple must abandon her place, but she\u2019s not afraid. Born a decade after the dead started coming back, Temple has only ever known a world filled with desperate survival, violence, and little stability. She takes her pieces of heaven where she can find them and keeps moving.\u201cWell ain\u2019t I been some places, ain\u2019t I partook in some glorious happenings wanderin my way between heaven and earth. And if I ain\u2019t seen everything there is to see, it wasn\u2019t for lack of lookin. Blind is the real dead.\u201dIt\u2019s clear that this author has really thought about what a person raised in this sort of environment might become. Temple cannot settle in a safe, monotonous place. Her body functions on a level where near death experiences are an everyday occurrence. She views the zombies as extensions of nature, like animals. She pities them and deals with them as they come, but she does not experience a great deal of anxiety about them. They are a constant presence in her life. And it becomes clear in the novel that the zombies are not the real monsters in this story.\u201cI don\u2019t know about evil, Temple says. Them meatskins are just animals is all. Evil\u2019s a thing of the mind. We humans got the full measure of it ourselves.\u201dTemple has a strict moral code that she lives by, and her philosophy seems to be ideal for the life that she leads. But the fault lines of trauma and memory soon become visible in her character. She\u2019s running away from a past that she doesn\u2019t know how to deal with. She believes that she is, at her core, evil, even though it is clear to us that she is not.What\u2019s interesting is that for all the running and denial she does of her past deeds, Temple has more acceptance of her world than just about anyone else in this novel. She doesn\u2019t lament the loss of the past that everyone else seems to glorify, she lives in the world that she knows.\u201c\u2026you gotta look at the world that is and try not to get bogged down by what it ain\u2019t.\u201dAnd I love all of the characters that she runs into in her travels that seem to be inhabiting the \u201cworld that is\u201d instead of wishing for the world that ain\u2019t. There seems to be a message here about the fullness of experience and how it comes more easily when the veils of civilization and law and society are lifted. Sometimes the fullest and most real experiences happen during periods of tragedy and death.\u201cSometimes when there\u2019s no light to see by, that\u2019s when everything comes sharp and clear.\u201dI really thought that I knew just what this book was trying to tell me, but then the ending really just threw me for a loop. I felt like I had been following the author\u2019s carefully laid trail of breadcrumbs, nodding my head, and then upon reaching the end I realized, \u201cWait a minute! These aren\u2019t breadcrumbs that I\u2019m eating; they\u2019re dirt!\" And I haven\u2019t enjoyed eating dirt since I was two. But then I had an extremely long discussion over at Jo\u2019s review and now I feel like I have a better understanding of the whole book.

Beware, the descriptions can turn your stomach they are so detailed and visual, this is some great writing. I loved that they had some confusion but no humanity let in them. There was just a touch of memory left but not enough to make you feel sorry for them.Temple is 15, and has seen too much of this world to have mush hope of seeing much more.

It\u2019s one of those niggly books that worms its way into your brain and takes root. I haven\u2019t decided whether that\u2019s a good thing or not.

I got it (I think), I just think there could have been a better away to get the point across. But don't ask me how, because I couldn't tell you.But that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say because I\u2019m being mysterious.Ditto with Millie.Heroine.Temple is one of the strongest and most memorable heroines that I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. She is resourceful, she is powerful, she is rational and she is only fifteen. Born into a world that was already in the grips of this \u2018slug\u2019 apocalypse, Temple had to grow up quickly and deal with things that are impossible to fathom. And all of that puts a lot of things in perspective....And that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.

I know this is going to sound strange, especially if you\u2019ve read this book and know what happens in the story, but this book made me feel really happy. A lot of awful things happen in this book or have happened and are alluded to but there is a definite vein of hope that pulses through Temple\u2019s story. That isn\u2019t to say that every character is like that, far from it, but the characters that I will remember the most (Lee, for example, and Temple herself) had not given up and are still looking for beauty in a world where it would be easy to believe that everything is decayed and tainted.I really respected Temple's acceptance of her place in the world and how she never fails to see and make the most of her time on this world. It may not be perfect and it may not be what she would\u2019ve chosen but it\u2019s what she has and it\u2019s her now and there\u2019s no point looking backwards and she isn\u2019t going to waste a minute of it.

The story offered just enough that I tolerated the many flaws and dragged myself to the end. My endurance was rewarded by one of the worst endings in the history of fiction. The sad thing is the post apocalyptic setting had potential. This story takes place 25 years after a zombie apocalypse has wiped out the better part of the population. We follow Temple, a 15 year old girl, as she struggles for survival in this bleak dystopian world. She has to contend as much with threats from the other people she meets as she does from the zombies. One of the main flaws this book had is that Temple just meandered around aimlessly, as did the plot. Initially Temple seeks solitude as a result of suffering a personal tragedy. When her hideout becomes compromised she moves on. However at the first human settlement she finds she manages to attract the attention of two twisted brothers. Both of whom develop a fixation with her, one of them so much so that he proceeds to chase her around in the hopes of murdering her. Despite her reluctance to socialize or bond with other people Temple does manage to pick up a dependent in the form of the mentally disabled Maury which gives her life a small sense of purpose and direction. Temple was a likable enough character. She was tough and independent and understood what it took to survive in a world such as this one. Her life was a tough one and she was left emotionally scarred by her experiences, but despite that still seemed to retain a fairly positive outlook on life and plenty of compassion. Along the way Temple managed to meet a few interesting characters. The most memorable were the twisted and delusional Todd brothers and the Grierson family. The world was a poorly constructed one. I can only imagine it was set in some sort of post apocalyptic zombie magical wonderland because despite the story picking up 25 years after the fall of civilization things like fuel, electricity, and food are still abundant. The zombies themselves are little more than a throw away plot device and so slow and useless that it is a wonder they ever managed to decimate the population. In another irritating, ridiculous, and logic bending development people who were bitten by zombies became infected and turned into zombies themselves, but people who chomped on zombies were completely fine. I was not a fan of the writing style of Alden Bell at all. It was awkward, pretentious, distant, and just plain weird. A lot of the ridiculous descriptions were so poorly placed that they actually managed to steal the tension from the happenings. All of this resulted in me being left so emotionally unengaged by the story and the characters that I did not care much about what happened. Bad writing lead to Temple seeming like an inconsistent character. She has no formal education, awful grammar, and her speech is packed full of regional dialect and colloquialisms. Unfortunately this often gets forgotten as Temple channels her inner Alden Bell. Either that or she swallowed a thesaurus somewhere along the way! I'm not sure what the purpose or the message of this story was. It all seemed pretty pointless to me. The ending was as dreadful as it was predictable. I had it figured out before the halfway mark, but still managed to be disappointed by the execution. The book would have made more of an impact had the final two chapters been completely cut. The sequel has no audio version available which I assume means this book bombed commercially. Despite all my moaning I did feel like there was a decent story hiding somewhere among the flaws. It just never quite managed to reveal itself. Which is why I was so frustrated while reading this one. Rating: 2.5 stars. Audio Note: Tai Sammons did OK."}, {"userName": "Beatriz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46560610-beatriz", "userReview": "Ufff\u2026 hace tiempo que no me costaba tanto rese\u00f1ar un libro. \u00bfMe gust\u00f3? S\u00ed, me gust\u00f3, pero no por lo que uno podr\u00eda esperar en un libro de zombis. Tal como he le\u00eddo en otros comentarios, el apocalipsis zombi descrito en esta novela es s\u00f3lo una excusa para lo que realmente quiere contar.En primer lugar el estilo narrativo es fascinante, esa forma de incorporar los di\u00e1logos dentro de las mismas descripciones me encant\u00f3 y nos permite descubrir a uno de los mejores personajes con los que me he encontrado este a\u00f1o: Temple. Ella es una adolescente de quince a\u00f1os que no alcanz\u00f3 a conocer el mundo antes de su destrucci\u00f3n. Viaja sola, cargando con una serie de p\u00e9rdidas que la han convertido en una mujer hecha y derecha antes de tiempo, con una escala de valores tan alta, que casi resulta incomprensible considerando el entorno en el que ha crecido.Temple no busca asentarse con grupos de sobrevivientes, a pesar de que encuentra varios en su camino. Su b\u00fasqueda es mucho m\u00e1s profunda y se enfoca constantemente en comportarse acorde a c\u00f3digos morales que tampoco comprende, asombr\u00e1ndose en la belleza de las peque\u00f1as cosas que un mundo devastado a\u00fan puede ofrecer. Probablemente, Moses Todd, quien la persigue debido a que ella mat\u00f3 a su hermano por accidente, sea el \u00fanico que la entienda. Por lo mismo, me lleg\u00f3 a exasperar su tozudez al no querer cambiar el objetivo que los une.Odi\u00e9 el final, no porque sea malo, sino por ese sentido de inevitabilidad que \u00faltimamente acompa\u00f1a a todas las novelas de este g\u00e9nero que he le\u00eddo, y que no me deja ponerle las cuatro estrellas que quiz\u00e1 este libro se merece.

A cleansing like the holy flood was, to slough away the dead and bring dandelions and butterflies to bear every which way on the ruined surface of the world. But it doesn\u2019t work like that. Instead, it just gets cold and damp and shivery in your collar, and afterwards, when the sun comes back from behind the clouds, there\u2019s just more mould and rot than there was previous, and the stink rises like gas from every soil and stone.This is most definitely not YA. What this is, is one of the most evocative and moving uses of the zombie apocalypse I've seen (and I've read a LOT of zombie/end of the world fiction). The language is dialect, but light - I'm usually distracted by attempts at writing accents and this didn't bother me at all. Rather, I found myself picturing the book more than anything; if I was asked to recall passages now I'd definitely see a scene rather than writing on a page. It's beautifully written.When night comes, the land is tar dark. The running lights on the train penetrate just barely into the scrub as they pass by it, a scrim of weeds and thorns from which, every so often, she can see the pale faces of the dead watching her progress, as though these rails lead directly to a grim asphodel underworld where the host of the haunted give guidance and pay respect to these pilgrims from another place.That's not to say it's not grim, which again - usually not my thing. But the grimness is used to highlight those sparkling moments where the sun finds the gap in the clouds and sets everything to glimmering - it's not just grim trying to grind the joy out of everyone who reads it. There were moments that made me cry, but it's a book I'm very glad to have read. One of the few zombie novels that really works outside of the zombie novel niche as well."}, {"userName": "Robert Beveridge", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/766524-robert-beveridge", "userReview": "Alden Bell, The Reapers Are the Angels (Holt, 2010)Amazon Vine, wonderful folks that they are, provided me with the best book I read last year hands down, China Mieville's The City and the City. And now, they've provided me with another book that has a strong chance of topping 2010's list: Alden Bell's debut novel, The Reapers Are the Angels. (If you're wondering, as I was, about the awkward title, it's a Biblical quote.) Actually, while it's Alden Bell's debut novel, it's not, really. Alden Bell is the horror-novelist nom de plume of Joshua Gaylord, an English professor who splits his time between family dramas (last year's Hummingbirds) and literary criticism (A Tour of the Darkling Plain: The Finnegan's Wake Letters of Thornton Wilder and Adaline Glasheen). So it should not surprise anyone that this is an entirely different zombie novel than one gets from, say, John Russo or David Moody. It's in the same zip code, but plays in a different stadium, as it were. Michael Gruber, in his blurb, calls it \u201cFlannery O'Connor with zombies\u201d, but Bell has a much more recent literary antecedent, to me: Cormac McCarthy.Temple is fifteen years old, and one of the few-and-far-between survivors of the zombie apocalypse (Temple refers to the zombies as meatskins, and the first time she does so, you'll find yourself wondering why no one else ever came up with that sobriquet in a zombie novel). As we open, she's living in an abandoned lighthouse on an island, but the zombies have found her, and it's time to move on. She finds a group of survivors and bunks with them for a while, until unwanted advances from a creepy stalker type result in his death. She heads back out on the road, this time pursued by Moses, the creepy stalker type's brother, who's looking for vengeance. Along the way, she picks up Maury, a mentally challenged survivor, and finds a purpose in trying to get him home.If you've read McCarthy's The Road, the parallels are obvious, which brings the differences into contrast as well. The Reapers Are the Angels has a warmer, more human feel to it, and Bell's prose is a lot more readable than McCarthy's, but the underlying bleakness cuts across both novels in a wide and terrible swath. And where McCarthy's enemies were all of the human variety, Bell gives us the undead\u2014though by now I'm sure we're all aware that zombies are the most human-like of the undead because they're a parallel for modern culture (and have been since Dawn of the Dead, if not before). It would probably be flip to suggest Bell's novel as more optimistic, because he actually sees a culture (even if that culture is trying to eat his protagonists alive) where McCarthy sees nothing but post-apocalyptic desolation, but that would explain the warmer feel, now wouldn't it?Perhaps as important in this equation is the relationship between Moses and Temple (and yes, perhaps Bell could have had a lighter hand with the names here). Your basic buddy-cop formula is so, so played out, which is why Se7en stick in the mind as such a great film; there's no buddiness to the cops. They respect each other, enough for Somerset to make the offer he does at the end of the film, but at no point in the movie do they end up liking one another. That's a tough thing to do, showing respect mixed with antipathy, but Bell pulls it off here. Moses and Temple find themselves working together as often as they do sighting down barrels at one another, and you expect Bell to fall off that cliff and into aw-shucks land any minute now, but he never does. Moses never loses sight of his goal, even as his respect for Temple grows, and because of that, we, as readers, keep our respect for Moses\u2014and for Bell, as well.Since I wrote the first paragraph of this review, I've hit a remarkable run of excellent books, and The Reapers Are the Angels is now in contention for the #2 slot on this year's best-of list rather than being a shoo-in for the top slot. But make no mistake, this is one of the best horror novels I've read in years. One of the best novels of any genre, for that matter. Highly recommended; you need to read this book. *****"}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "[Between the scene in the beginning with Abraham pulling his pants down and the description of what he looked like and between the COMPLETELY RANDOM sex scene between a 15 year old girl and a 25 year old guy that she barely knew (hide spoiler)]"}], "description": "Zombies have infested a fallen America.
