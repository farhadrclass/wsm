I think it encompasses all my other grips about the book.Basically the situation is like this: a woman journalist is in Kabul after 9/11. She meets this bookseller, lives with his family a few months with only 3 people in the family speaking English and then she writes a book about them. First of all, having lived abroad and lived abroad with families, you can't know a family the way this author pretends to in that time. We don't even know how she interacted with the family because she writes herself out of the book entirely. She somehow thinks that she hasn't effected the family's life and that she can just describe them as if there is not some strange white woman sitting on the floor taking notes as they live their lives.The book is written with such heavy condescension that I wanted to throw up. The moral I took away from the book is that life in Afghanistan sucks, especially if you are a woman, and it's all due to their stupid culture. Warning, this is not what I think, this is what I think the author was telling me to think.The author says in the preface that she was inspired by this family. But from how she wrote the book it seems she was disgusted. I don't understand how she can write that way without even writing herself in, therefore allowing the follies of inter cultural miscommunication and misunderstanding play a part."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "A very interesting, journalistic depiction of life in Afghanistan as told from inside the tent of a relatively well-to-do family, with particular attention to the experiences of females.

Maybe a huge culture shock is at play here. Many in the West may be put off by the realization that the values that they take for granted may be totally unheard of in certain parts of the world. There *are* certain cultures where children are nothing but tools for parents and as such, are actively denied education. There *are* cultures where falling in love is a greater \"crime\" than sawing off a person's head. I know for a fact that people in my culture have gotten used to murders and negligence of human rights, but if a couple were caught kissing in public, as it were the very fabric of society would be shred to smithereens. There *are* societies where women are nothing more than baby-making and house-keeping machines, commodities which are to be sold off in the financial ritual of marriage. Since I grew up in a culture not vastly different from the one portrayed in this book, I find it hard to dismiss this account as prejudiced hogwash. That, and I also steer clear of any sort of cultural relativism. I know for a fact that no one in the comparatively progressive world would want to be a woman in Afghan society after reading this book, even more so after living in the country for some time by himself/herself. The author may not have captured Afghan culture in its entirety(and no where has she made that claim), but she has been anything but prejudiced.For me, the pathos in this book lies in the hopes and aspirations of the members of the Khan family living in a post-Taliban Afghanistan. The women want education and a job, the children want to play, young men and women of the country want to fall in love in spite of knowing the dire consequences, and Sultan Khan wants to contribute towards building a better and liberal Afghanistan, a country which he can boast of to the world. This book draws a very humane picture of an obscure society, a picture that very often fails to filter through the coloured glasses of mainstream media."}, {"userName": "Maria Espadinha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20749430-maria-espadinha", "userReview": "Sua Majestade O IslamismoA queda dos Taliban no Afeganist\u00e3o surtiu alguma abertura no que toca \u00e0 condi\u00e7\u00e3o da mulher.As raparigas regressaram \u00e0s escolas, e \u00e0 mulher foi legalmente concedido, o direito ao trabalho.Contudo, a lei familiar prevalece.

In fact, I struggled to get into this 'novel' - for nothing in the book presented any characteristics expected of a novel. There was no story line at all to begin with. No plot, no highs and lows, no lyrical prose, no good or bad, no character building - NOTHING. But it was a best seller. Ya well no fine! It was obviously a best seller for reasons beyond my understanding, but as a novel, or well-written one? - nope, sorry. The question remains though: WHY was it promoted and sold as a novel?It is an expanded set of articles(dare it be called essays?) which became long enough to fill up a book. It wasn't a story. It was a bundle of interviews with all the characters blanketed by a liberal, inexperienced viewpoint from observing filth, poverty, oppression, cruelty, and whatever adjectives or synonyms for it could be found in a journalist's vocabulary. Neither the male, nor the female interviewees were good people, according to the interpretation of their family life by the author. Bottom line: the journalist was disgusted with the whole set-up and pushed it down my throat with my consent. After all, I wanted to finish the book, right!? In retrospect I am more annoyed with myself for wasting valuable time and energy in allowing it to happen! Compared to \"A Thousand Splendid Suns\" written by Khaled Hosseini, this was a memoir, an optimistic attempt by a writer to cross the bridge between being an investigative journalist to novelist and just not succeeding very well. It is not a type of biography either, and not even remotely on par with a real novelist such as Hosseini, who wrote from within his own community to start off with.But okay, so it wasn't a novel, so let me at least credit the author for her effort: It is an in-depth look at the typical Afghan family experiencing and surviving different occupations of their country. The fact that she stayed three months with Sultan, the book seller, and his extended family, allowed her insight into their lives that is not showered upon many westerners. Although she is not present in the book, the situation is presented from her viewpoint. It is splashed all over the book. Her observations are detailed. The book highlights the effect of suppression on human lives. In this case, freedom of choice for the men, mostly,was taken away first by the Communists, then Mujahedeen and lastly the Taliban. Women never had any freedom neither choice anyway. The impact on the people is enormous as far as restructuring their lives is concerned. And then 9/11 happened and the Americans came. But if I really want to know what is happening now, I will have to consult the internet and the Al Jazeera news channel. It will be an extension of this book. An investigative journalistic report.I did endure until the last full stop. So you wonder how the book ends? Well, what do you expect?! It is always a matter of choice if you want to find out. Expectations differ from person to person, after all. I will respect your point of view no matter what. I apologize for pushing my annoyance down your throat in case you have opted to read to this point ;-)"}, {"userName": "F", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8161922-f", "userReview": "Loved it!Not long back from Pakistan and it was the perfect time to read this.Love learning about the culture.

This is the personal story of almost every human being, mainly women of the household, from the bookseller family, with two wives and tons of children and an equally great number of siblings, the bookseller is a subtly liberal man of his times, that only demanded women of each and every household to stay indoors and keep giving birth until their last dying breath.Synopsis: In spring 2002, following the fall of the Taliban, Asne Seierstad spent four months living with a bookseller and his family in Kabul.For more than twenty years Sultan Khan defied the authorities - be they communist or Taliban - to supply books to the people of Kabul. He was arrested, interrogated and imprisoned by the communists, and watched illiterate Taliban soldiers burn piles of his books in the street. He even resorted to hiding most of his stock - almost ten thousand books - in attics all over Kabul.But while Khan is passionate in his love of books and his hatred of censorship, he also has strict views on family life and the role of women. As an outsider, Asne Seierstad found herself in a unique position, able to move freely between the private, restricted sphere of the women - including Khan's two wives - and the freer, more public lives of the men.It is an experience that Seierstad finds both fascinating and frustrating. As she steps back from the page and allows the Khans to speak for themselves, we learn of proposals and marriages, hope and fear, crime and punishment. The result is a genuinely gripping and moving portrait of a family, and a clear-eyed assessment of a country struggling to free itself from history. The household of Sultan Khan in Kabul, ruled under the communist party, which is later succeeded by the Taliban's dictatorial rule, is not a happy place for the women, with two wives and a handful of children from the wives and lots of siblings and grandparents. This house is more like a time warp with one generation after another shares their journeys together, despite of unhappiness and constraints. Although Sultan Khan who is a reputed bookshop owner, selling modern Afghan books, some controversial Afghan books and a lot of history books about Afghanistan, is a free-thinker and a liberal man about politics and his patriotism, yet he is a very tyrannical man when it comes to the women of his household, be it his wives or his daughters or his sisters or his own mother, he dominates them all with old customs and difficult rules as set in the Holy Quran by the Prophet. Sultan Khan never believed in women's equal rights or their right to education or their right to choose their own husbands or their right to live freely, only in the right to obey the man of the house with their heads bowing-down-to-their-feet. Seierstad has lived with this particular Muslim family for four months to experience their grueling lifestyle both in a repressive household as well as in a country dominated by warlords and religious dictators. Always being on the verge of a civil war, Afghanistan has forever suffered a lot, lost a lot of its history in the dust and the bloodshed, and so are the country's women, who too have suffered silently through ages. The author has brought out and have captured vividly those pain of both the country as well as of the women always clad and bound behind a black veil and a burka, evocatively. The author's personal account definitely moved me and that too very deeply, but has failed to stir any emotions or my thoughts towards the women or the men from this book. The author's writing style is eloquent and evocative enough to make the readers feel and comprehend with her story line. The narrative is very mush realistic, and it will feel like the characters voicing their honest opinions discreetly in the ears of the author. Even though it has been translated into English, I felt that the charm of the author and her flair has not been lost in translation. The prose is articulate and really strong and that which leaves room for the readers' own judgement and thoughts. The backdrop of an unhinged Kabul is portrayed strikingly by the author in her story line, and have successfully captured both the rugged and golden terrains and landscape as well as the struggle of the country's citizens, especially the women. While reading, the book transported me straight in front of Sultan's bookshop as well as right in the middle of his large brick house, and felt the scenes unraveling right before my own eyes. The author not only did her research well enough to strike a cord into the hearts of her readers, but have also arrested them in a fascinating way to let the readers experience a troubled and terror-stricken country from their minds' eyes. The characters are the most disappointing fact of this book as they will not only fail to impress the readers of the book, but will only irk them up with their lack of development. As for me, I lost interest in their tragedy or in their lights, what kept me engaged is the country's disturbing politics and religious extremist ideals. The lives of the female characters could have been written with much more depth, so that they could leave an imprint in the minds of the readers. The accounts of the women are very scattered and disoriented, hence at times, I felt very bored to keep reading the book. In a nutshell, even though this is non fictional account of a journalist-turned-author's experience of living in a dangerous and repressive Muslim country, yet somehow, this book is not that great enough to read and explore about such a country. I do not recommend this to any reader.

After the Taliban seized power all female faces disappeared from the streets of Kabul.My heart really hurts for these women and girls who suffered so under the Islamists and had to be hidden away and obey through fear.And I point an accusing finger at all those leftists who claim to believe in feminism but defend excesses Should women in these countries got less rights than what you people take for granted?Even after the Taliban were overthrown women and girls feared going out alone or dressing as they pleased, because of the residue of terror that the Taliban had left behind.During the Taliban era one of the most hated buildings in Kabul was the \"Department for the Promotion of Virtue and Extermination of Sin\". Here women who had walked unescorted by a male relative, or who wore makeup under their burkas, and men who cut their beards, languished under torture and many died.Before that these had once bee the headquarters of the equally brutal Soviets.No wonder Leftists and Islamo-Fascists love each other so much. They both have the mania for cruelty and destruction and the death impulse.Asne Seirstadt witnessed the destruction and death left behind by the Taliban.The Taliban engaged in ethnic cleansing of the Tajiks and other minorities in northern Afghanistan, raising entire villages to the ground and poisoning water wells and blowing water pipes and dams (vital for survival in these dry plains) before they withdrew.Seirstadt masterfully covers the sights, sounds and smells of Afghanistan from the cramped life in people's houses where extended families lived together to the bazaars and the 'hamman', the massive communal bath, where thousands of women cleaned themselves and their children on certain days of the week.Seirstadt captures much of Afghanistan's history and life and culture in these pages.It is an excellent book for those who want to learn about this country."}, {"userName": "Eileen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70356-eileen", "userReview": "I think I learned more from this one book than from any news story or other examination of Afghanistan.  You think, after reading the forward and the beginning of the book, that the bookseller will be a progressive man, but his love for his country's history and its literary heritage is his only redeeming quality and yet the very reason he is such a bastard toward his family. Everything comes second to his passion. In the wake of the Taliban's withdrawal we see them slowly try to regain their freedoms, but after years of outside oppression, the feeling has slowly sunk inward. Sultan's sister is too repressed to speak up in her own defense. His sons do not speak up against their father's wishes which prevent them from having a decent childhood as they slave away in his shops. And his own wife, once a respected professor, must bow to the will of her firstborn who says he does not want to work, even though it is her only desire.  There are glimmers of hope along the way as fate does give the women, who become the true stars of this book a chance. And there are some wiser people amongst the Khan family who have figured out what the country truly needs and that peace is dependent upon throwing off the desire for power that has caused so much war in the country. Ironically, at one point in the book, a hotel guard in the worst territory in Afghanistan, observing one of Khan's family members helping an American journalist operate a satellite phone, the likes of which the hotel guard has never seen, says \"Do you know what our problem is? We know everything about our weapons but we know nothing about how to use a telephone.\" Lack of communication seems to be the greatest obstacle in the book and the one that holds the country back.

Seirstad never once pretends that she's being unbiased and doesn't apologize for the obvious slant. Frankly, her slant is what I believe mine would be, as I can't deal with overbearing ANYBODY deciding what's best for me or telling me how I must live. What impressed me the most was her willingness as a naive Western woman to go off by herself and live in an Afghan family, which is something I could never do. Living in a family of religious extremists (of any stripe) is not the same as living as an exchange student. Her experience doing so is her experience - sorry it wasn't pretty. The fact is, she lived in Afghanistan and managed not to get killed, raped, sold, or go stark raving mad. She is living proof that Western women can survive in Afghanistan.As for her book \"feeling hopeless\" - perhaps that's because she didn't see any hope. Thinking that world peace is possible (it's not) and that every bad situation will eventually work out (they don't all) to make butterflies and rainbows is a serious failing of American \"investigative\" journalism. Folks who think and write that way should take a lesson from George Orwell and Upton Sinclair.

First of all, books are not what usually comes to my mind when I think of contemporary Afghanistan and I was rather curious of the story; secondly, I had already known \u00c5sne Seierstad from her book about Anders Breivik and expected good narrative and distinctive characters that would be outlined with subtlety and develop into force majeure of the book. The choice proved to be right on a couple of different levels. Nothing is straight forward with Seierstad, not even the title of her book. One would naively expect a story of a bookseller, possibly under the Taliban regime (to add some literary drama to half-expected romanticism and martyrdom), but what we get instead is a total confusion over values and priorities of this book lover, history enthusiast, art admirer and culture defender who stands up to stupidity of various ignorants and self-styled chiefs but also turns out to be a cold businessman and patriarchal tyrant with a quasi-misogynistic attitude, which causes a certain confusion in the Western mind, torn between respect for different cultures and disagreement for injustice. This tension is what makes this book so special - the conflict between what is and what should be, the black and the white reigning over thousands shades of various colours, beautiful but pale, not strong enough to make a difference in this nevertheless chromatic picture.I really value Seierstad's way of storytelling, her images of women living inside the burka who move like fluttering wings of giant birds when they walk through the market, covered in individual smells and wrapped in their own quickened breath. I disagree with those who say that the author looks at the Afghani culture with ignorant superiority - I think she actually approaches it with honesty and open mind that is able to see the complexity of reality and avoids unfair judgements. Seierstad lets her characters speak for themselves and this tactic creates a rather amazing book full of heart-breaking stories and vivid scenes from this difficult but very interesting country. But as life often shows, first comes fame, then comes controversy - the bookseller of Kabul, Shah Muhammad Rais, sued the author for defamation soon after the book's success. Again, I think Seierstad did her best to keep her opinions out of her reportage and did not judge the Afghan society by her Norwegian standards. If she somehow let her personal views be seen, she did it as a human being who listened to other people and empathised with their explicitly expressed feelings. Here we are faced with the old literary question - is neutrality of writing ever possible? Is it doable to write about anything and not give a bit of ourselves to the text? Shah Muhammad Rais wrote this book as much as Seierstad did - he was chosen by her for his non-stereotypical devotion to literature and culture, quite rare in that haunted by post-war destruction and poverty society, but in the end his behaviour proved to be not very different from stereotypes which we normally frown upon. Was it to be veiled like all the other things denied by those who forbid any inconvenient truth, like everything that the very same bookseller fought for when he collected thousands of volumes to preserve what was seen by the Talibans as ungodly and immoral? This book is an important portrait of Afghanistan that still struggles to be understood not just by the Western world but also by its own people. Written with skill and intimacy, it quietly observes but also provokes to think beyond the text. A compelling read."}, {"userName": "Em", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90453-em", "userReview": "Okay so the author seems very naive, and that's a pretty safe bet. She is knowledgeable however, so I'll give her that. I wouldn't take this book seriously if you're looking for some real social or historical insight into Afghanistan. It really pales in that sense. If you're looking for a light read and a good story, in that sense, it's good and can offer some inspiration. So it's all right so far.--All right, just finished it. It was interesting and page-turning, but the author's tone really aggravated me. She spoke sardonically of situations that held little humour. Also, she assumed a sort of deep knowledge of her subjects and largely oversimplified the context in which the Khan family lived. She started to speak in like a personal third person, as if she understood deeply the characters' thoughts. I do not believe she had this understanding and therefore do not think she should have conveyed it as such. It is trespassing; even the best journalist/reporters cannot assume the character's inner beliefs and feelings.She presupposes a lot. Living with a family for a few months and only interacting with the three English-speaking members of the family does not merit her sweeping generalizations. Granted, she makes a disclaimer that the Khan family does not represent all Afghanis. She has an obvious oversight with regard to her generalizing her own observations to proclaim so much about the family. Not only does she entirely write herself out of the story, which completely limits the reader's ability to validate whether or not her interactions yielded this much understanding about the family, but she disregards the fact that many of her observations might be from an oblique angle and that her presence itself undoubtedly must have affected the family. Her observations are without citation, in that sense, because she does not give her analysis any supporting framework or context.It also lacked a central theme or a point. After reading it, I can't say there was some message she got across to me, just a series of loosely related anecdotes. No real declaration, but there were some beautiful nuances. Other than that, no real thesis.Pros: she described characters beautifully. It was surprising how you could at once hate and love a character, know nothing about them and then second guess yourself and find yourself completely enthralled in their identities. She talked about real people and she made them real in her pages with her intimate detailing of idiosyncratic observations. You got a sense of the reality of her characters in their interactions. I couldn't quite tell if she translated the characters' stories with love or contempt, but I guess it doesn't really matter in the end, because it's the reader. And I guess as a reader I loved them and hated them so...hey.The book was really despondent. There wasn't anything really hopeful about it, and any hope I could manage to find, the author emphatically dashed. I think she was actively propagating that Afghanistan was a place with no hope of improving and that it stagnated in archaic traditions and had no way out. Most exposes will at least bestow a sense of felicity upon the reader in the form of some meager optimism, but this author was not that geneous. In this way, I disagree with her portrayal. Albeit it being a nonfiction, and although she can't embellish with happy moments, her narrations of anything good were few and far between. I think that even in the worst of scenarios, which the Khan family did not represent, there could be some light shed, but she just made the whole story dismal and lacking any connection to a future ambition for the country, like she was just telling a tragedy and leaving.I guess I'm happy I read it. I guess I kinda liked it--but somewhat grudgingly."}, {"userName": "Tera", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/767086-tera", "userReview": "The most depressing book about the area that I have read.

The author chose to write it as though it was a novel and not a journalistic account. This incurs the risk - as it is obvious when one reads other reviews - of having readers confusing it with actual fiction. Then there's the whole \"western gaze\". This is a norwegian woman writing on a society she does not belong to, a society that is very different from hers, and it can perfectly be argued that five months spent amongst a family are not sufficient to actually know them or the society they live in. There's also the question of privacy: is it right for someone to expose the inner life of a family in such a way? Perhaps a more interesting question, wasn't it incredibly naive of Sultan Khan (Shah Rais in real life) to accept a European journalist into his own house and think that the portray she d'paint would be positive? And wasn't it naive of Seierstad to think that Rais would gladly go along with the portrayal of his family in the book? Perhaps Seierstad didn't care. She probably should have. There is something very unkind in the way she exposes the thoughts of the people - especially the women - who are already suffering under the pressure of living in a such a patriarchal society. Oppressed people don't have to be exposed to prove their oppression. Especially not in such an undignified way. The most important question that Seierstad manages to ask, however, is how can an educated man, who wants to edit school textbooks and who believes in a (limited) form of free thought (after all, Sultan Khan would never sell Salman Rushdie at his bookshop) be so unable to understand the oppressive nature of the society he lives in and so blind to his own personal contribution to it?I would very much like to not believe this book. I would very much like to believe, like other reviewers do, that she can't possibly know all the things she claims to know, because why would people confide in a foreigner like this, why do all these people speak English? I would love to be able to dismiss this book based on her condescending tone and on her belief in the superiority of the western world. And I am ready to believe that there are \"embellishments\" and exaggerations. Seierstad admits as much in a interview to the Guardian: \"If I write a book in future, I may decide to take the precaution of going back to every person I interview, reading their quotes back to them and asking them to sign a letter, saying it is accurate... In everything I write, ever again, I need to make sure I am 100% accurate. A journalist can get away with this sort of controversy once, but I can't survive it again.\" ( https://www.theguardian.com/theguardi... )However, at the same time I also can't help but think that it would be incredibly naive to believe that many situations portrayed here aren't horrifying real. It is precisely for this reason that they deserve a better journalistic treatment than the one given by Seierstad."}, {"userName": "Fatema Hassan , bahrain", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013",

defiance of the authorities. The authority changed from Afghans to communists to Taliban, but the persecutions remained the same; imprisonment, arrest, beatings and regular interrogation. He suffered watching illiterate Taliban thugs burn piles of his books in the streets of Kabul, so he hid them. His collection and stock was secreted across attics and rooms across the capital. Whilst he abhorred censorship and was passionate about all things literary he was also an Afghan man. He had strict and immovable views on family life, the role of women in society and the home and how he treated people and expected them to treat him with due deference. It is into this family that Seierstad comes. In her unique position as a Western woman, she is able to move between the two hemispheres of male and female life in the home and the city, something that no male journalist would have been able to achieve. It is a time of huge change too, she arrived in 2002, just after the Taliban had be routed by the Americans, and whilst society had thrown of some of the shackles, many cultural norms still remained. In this she takes a step back and lets the Khans speak for themselves, and you see a very private life inside an Afghan family.It is not the easiest book to read, not because it isn\u2019t well written and translated, but because the society and culture that she describes is so very different to ours. It is brutal at times, heavily restricting women in what they can do, say and achieve in society, as well as having tribal fighting, harsh justice, precious little infrastructure and at times no hope. They have decades of oppression there and to make steps towards a society that has those opportunities that we take for granted will take many years and need deep fundamental changes to political and culture to bring it about. I had hoped that it would be more about the perils of the book business there, and whilst it made for a fascinating account, didn\u2019t live up to what I had hoped for."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56521110-louise", "userReview": "My knowledge of Afghan culture is really minimal so cannot really say how accurate a portrayal it is.

Throughout the book I was waiting for something to happen or for conclusions to individual stories and I know this was my expectations so therefore perhaps this is the reason that I found the book lacking.I did find the historical content of the book really interesting and felt such sadness for some of the characters especially the women who are treated so badly and have no control over their futures, I found the power fathers, husbands, brothers and sons have over their wives mothers, sisters and daughters so disturbing that I found it difficult reading as I wanted these women to triumph over these self obsessed men but that I am afraid this would not be true in the society they live in. This is an interesting book and I think would make an excellent book club read as there is plenty to discuss here."}, {"userName": "Michel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1429477-michel", "userReview": "We all know those travel books who pretend to teach you about a culture of which the writer doesn't even speak the language: if you travel using this \"guide\", I can only feel sorry for you (alright, I'll drop the pretense of anonymity: I mean Rick Steeve).Only this isn't about tourism, it's about the pain and suffering of an entire country that hasn't known peace and respect for as long as they can remember. Patronizing them and their \"inferior\" culture isn't just tasteless, it's downright damnable. And doing so without acknowledging that you write from the Pov of one unknowing foreigner is misleading too.I stopped reading this book about one third of the way.

A bookseller's family is unusual in a country where three quarters of the population can neither read nor write.\"After Taliban's rule in the country, Afghanistan tried to set up their country back to how a democracy should be. Tried to rule out all the old laws made by Taliban. The story is both a nation which was determined and believed in rising up after loosing its freedom to gunmen. \n\"This is how first-year schoolchildren learn the alphabet: 'J is for Jihad, our aim in life, I is for Israel, our enemy, K is for Kalashnikov, we will overcome....\"\nSultan Khan is a bookseller in Afghanistan. He has many book stores and he believes that everyone should have access to books but never sent his kids to school. He wants women to be independent but doesn't let his sister work and earn. This book shows the lives of different members in his family and how they are dependent on him. His decision is something no one would ever oppose and will obey even when they see that he is wrong because he is the one who wants people to be free but wants he family be dependent on him. \n\" I laugh with my mouth, not my heart.\"\nMy favorite character was Leila as she was only one who actually want to be truly free and out of the cage. The book closely shows the culture and tradition of the country and how it slowly changed for women and children after years of trying. I really loved the epilogue where the author questions about other families' freedom and gives something to ponder over. Really love this book.

Who in their right mind is going to tell this white western woman okayed by Sultan anything as disparate (and desperate) as their feelings about him.

I read this book in just 3 days (which is very fast for me), but I had a hard time reading it, because I empathized with the people \u2013 especially the women \u2013 portrayed here and gosh\u2026 do they have a hard life\u2026 Even so, I did not like what I read in the introductory text by the author in which she says that although she\u2019s written the book in literary form, it is based on real events or what was told to her by people who took part in those events and then justifies the description of thoughts and feelings, as having used as point of departure what people told her they thought or felt. I think this is going too far, especially because even though she used different names, everybody now knows who the bookseller and his family are. The book I read just before this one, by a Portuguese journalist who was in Kabul a few years after the publication of The Bookseller of Kabul, includes a short mention to a visit to this bookshop. Not surprisingly, the bookseller told the Portuguese journalist he did not like the book, and I can only imagine what the consequences of this read have been for some of his family members...This being said, this was nevertheless a very good read that I recommend to everyone who likes to know more about other people\u2019s culture and history and who like reading fiction and non-fiction alike, because as mentioned above, it is written as a fiction book, but one can easily feel that the characters are based on real people."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "This was a selection from my in person book club and I found it to be okay. It is a true story and I thought I would be reading more about his quest to distribute literature in Kabul. Although he talks about it somewhat, it's not the main thrust of the book. Still the passages about the destruction of libraries and museums is enough to break your heart. I don't understand the \"logic\" of the Nazis and the Taliban in the burning of books but I guess it cuts down on people having different viewpoints. Sultan, the lead character, is not very likable although he has some admirable traits. His preservation of old books is admirable. As I read though, I discovered many of the traits I disliked were a product of his experiences and upbringing. If I had been through as many wars, imprisonments and beatings maybe I would make some of his decisions. It's hard to know. Of course, the tragedy of the women is heartbreaking. Their demeaning roles and lack of any type of freedom is horrific. I do not know where some of these sects get the idea that this is the way Mohammed would like them treated. Mohammed's wife, Fatima, was an educated businesswoman and I am sure he didn't treat her that way. Of course, many Christian sects due this to women too and there is nothing in the Bible that says Jesus advocates that type of behavior. I just found this an average book that really didn't explore any new territory for me."}], "description": "In spring 2002, following the fall of the Taliban, \u00c5sne Seierstad spent four months living with a bookseller and his family in Kabul.For more than twenty years Sultan Khan defied the authorities\u2014be they communist or Taliban\u2014to supply books to the people of Kabul. He was arrested, interrogated and imprisoned by the communists, and watched illiterate Taliban soldiers burn piles of his books in the street. He even resorted to hiding most of his stock\u2014almost ten thousand books\u2014in attics all over Kabul.But while Khan is passionate in his love of books and his hatred of censorship, he also has strict views on family life and the role of women. As an outsider, \u00c5sne Seierstad found herself in a unique position, able to move freely between the private, restricted sphere of the women\u2014including Khan\u2019s two wives\u2014and the freer, more public lives of the men.It is an experience that Seierstad finds both fascinating and frustrating. As she steps back from the page and allows the Khans to speak for themselves, we learn of proposals and marriages, hope and fear, crime and punishment. The result is a genuinely gripping and moving portrait of a family, and a clear-eyed assessment of a country struggling to free itself from history.' to 'This mesmerizing portrait of a proud man who, through three decades and successive repressive regimes, heroically braved persecution to bring books to the people of Kabul has elicited extraordinary praise throughout the world and become a phenomenal international bestseller. The Bookseller of Kabul is startling in its intimacy and its details\u2014a revelation of the plight of Afghan women and a window into the surprising realities of daily life in today\u2019s Afghanistan.'", "title": "The Bookseller of Kabul", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9838.The_Bookseller_of_Kabul", "average": 3.76, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388611939l/9838.jpg", "reviews": 2809, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/769979._sne_Seierstad", "name": "\u00c5sne Seierstad"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5825959.Ingrid_Christopherson", "name": "Ingrid Christopherson"}], "type": ["Autobiography", "Biography", "Travel", "History", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9838.The_Bookseller_of_Kabul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531176.The_Bookseller_of_Kabul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13448301-o-livreiro-de-cabul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827183.The_Bookseller_of_Kabul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22604614", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7682424", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33699.El_librero_de_Kabul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237163-one-of-us", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/673659.A_Hundred_and_One_Days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32740863-to-s-stre", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2808414-the-angel-of-grozny", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12811.With_Their_Backs_to_the_World", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
