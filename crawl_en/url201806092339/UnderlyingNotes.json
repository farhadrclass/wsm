It left me informed and deepened.Carla Matteo worked with her husband Joe since their marriage, building a successful business together. But she chose to pursue the business, even after she had trained for a career of her own, because she made the personal decision to show her love by working along side Joe to grow his company; his dream.With midlife, however, complexities arose: in marriage, in family secrets revealed, and in friendships. With Carla there was also a restlessness. Carla wasn't sure she wanted to live out the rest of her days without having explored her own dreams, her own career. And so she quit the business she had been such an integral part of, and began her adventure.Carla's was an internal adventure, filled with nuances, layers, secrets revealed, and \"underlying notes\" - just like the array of perfumes she's collected, studied, and befriended since childhood. When Carla \"takes to the bottle,\" she's talking about the perfume bottle!I found Carla's story captivating, not just in its content, but also because of author Eva Pasco's talent. Pasco's writing is like the scented labyrinths of her perfumes - we are treated to different layers of the story at different times. And when a \"note\" - or a story segment - comes together, it's as if the last piece of a puzzle turns the fragments into a whole picture.Like the many layers of a fine perfume, all the pieces of Carla's seemingly separate puzzles do come together - and we see, along with Carla, how her life makes sense, how her transition into her new life comes to be.I love the almost poetic style of Eva's novel. I love the obsession with and references to the perfumes her character has loved and lived with throughout her life. And Eva skillfully weaves in captivating \"notes\" about many of the perfumes' origins and the details of their ingredients.Eva's attention to detail, too, was almost life-changing for me. How her character Carla went about calmly and carefully solving the mysteries of her life was an inspiration.The essence of Underlying Notes will stay with me always. I totally recommend it 100%"}, {"userName": "Cindy Smith", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12365991-cindy-smith", "userReview": "When you hear someone has an addiction, perfume is not really where your mind goes. Well, Carla is definitely addicted to it. It is a constant in her life and her crutch as she faces her midlife crisis. A new neighbor and an accident brings the past forward and Carla faces it head on. The style this is written in reminds me of a diary, like I am reading Carla's private thoughts. The details about the different perfumes would have annoyed me had it not been for assuming this perspective. When you talk to yourself, you really don't care if you are exciting. I was invested in Carla and was hoping her travels led her to happiness. Not saying if it did but... I did feel that the end of the book was suddenly rushed, like there was a time limit to finish the book. It is the reason for the 4 stars I would say 4.5 but that is not an option. I hope Eva continues to write."}, {"userName": "Linda Dunlap", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27694765-linda-dunlap", "userReview": "The account of a restless, middle- aged woman obsessed by the fragrant memories of her youth as well as the offerings from the bottles on her bureau. Carla Matteo loves her husband, but secretly wonders, \"Is that all there is? Carla Matteo built her life inside her husband's company, forgoing her desire and opportunity to teach school rather than desert her man who needed her. Now, years have passed, and she strikes out in a form of fragrant defiance by retiring from the refuse company to pursue her own desires reviewing perfume on her blog. \" Underlying Notes\" is a humorous look at Carla's midlife crisis. Her obsessions include fragrance addiction and a wish for fullness in her now empty life. A flirtation with a sexy friend of her husband Joe tempts her as it stirs jealousy in her marriage,a until she realizes what is really important in her life. I like Eva's writing style and admire her extensive use of language as she portrays the emotions of her characters. Also, I respect the research she did in divining the myriad of ingredients in the branded fragrances she mentions. An altogether delightful book, Underlying Notes had me laughing at times and at others, it stirred sadness for all the lonely people who live their lives trying to recall what once made them happy."}, {"userName": "J.R.

She holds at least one trait or has lived an experience that we have all held or gone through..The author is writes fearlessly and in an excellent style and flow and shows us that Carla is only human. She makes mistakes and makes sacrifices she has regrets. Once I began the book Carla invited me into her family and took me on a emotional ride that I will not forget. When I was reading I was in wonder of what was to happen next ,I tried to guess but always fell short.The many animated characters and relatives all hit home in some form and the author describes them just so, as to give the reader a relationship with each person each human. Each reader will identify with at least one of these real people. but most importantly the real hero of this book is the author. One would be hard pressed to find better writing anywhere ..the classics included. I believe her next book is geared toward the fairer sex but guess what? Ill be buying it because I know it will contain something for me to learn and grow with."}, {"userName": "J.

She has a very unusual sense of smell, a talent which carries throughout the book. She carries off the story very well and keeps your interest in doing so.
