The old days of an inner circle of like-minded souls communicating with parchment and quill pens are gone. Sooner or later most things will be revealed.\u201d\nCaptain Alfred Dreyfus\u2019s mugshotGeorges Picquart was as convinced of Captain Alfred Dreyfus\u2019s guilt as anyone else in 1894. In fact for the invaluable service he provided during the affair he becomes the youngest Lieutenant Colonel in the French military. He is also promoted to head the Intelligence department, not the most prestigious appointment given that spying was considered rather unseemly, rather ungentlemanly. \u201dThe air warms up and very soon Paris starts to reek of shit. The stench rises out of the sewers and settles over the city like a putrid gas\u2026. In the newspapers the experts are unanimous that it isn\u2019t as bad as the original \u2018great stink\u2019 of 1880\u2026. \u2018It is impossible to stand on one\u2019s balcony,\u2019 complains Le Figaro, \u2018impossible to sit on the terrace of one of the busy, joyful cafes that are the pride of our boulevards, without thinking that one must be downwind from some uncouth, invisible giant.\u2019 The smell infiltrates one\u2019s hair and clothes and settles in one\u2019s nostrils, even on one\u2019s tongue, so that everything tastes of corruption. Such is the atmosphere on the day I take charge of the Statistical Section.\u201d\nMajor Esterhazy. \u201cHis head in profile is flattish and tapers like a vulture\u2019s to a great beak of a nose. His moustache is large and swept back. His eyes are round and protuberant: not natural, but crazy, like glass balls pressed into the skull of a skeleton in a medical school.\u201dThe stench becomes all consuming when Picquart sees a photocopy of the famous Bordereau Letter that was so pivotal in the conviction of Dreyfus. The problem is Picquart recognizes the handwriting, an almost exact match to a Major Ferdinand Esterhazy. A man he suspects of trying to sell secrets to the Germans. In the course of convicting Dreyfus several handwriting experts were consulting until finally they found one that said that Dreyfus was \u201cthe probable author\u201d of the letter. You might be downwind of that uncouth Giant yourself about right now. \nThe famous Bordereau Letter that \u201cincriminated\u201d Dreyfus, but should have exonerated him. The original copy of the letter mysteriously disappeared in the 1940s.So what is this really all about? The evidence against Dreyfus is built on such a tissue of lies that it is impossible to believe that any reasonable person could have found him guilty. Did I happen to mention that Dreyfus was Jewish? This all really begins back in 1870 when Germany started a unification program. Two regions Alsace and Moselle were annexed by the Germans. The result of this German aggression is the Franco-Prussian War that was disastrous for the French. They are soundly defeated despite having a large standing army and a jump start on mobilization. The Germans moved quickly, had a better understanding of the current technologies, and how to best deploy them in war. Their troops, to the surprise of the French, turned out to be better trained and were lead by more competent commanders. This defeat leads to a time of zealous nationalism and riding along in the sidecar right along with nationalism is a rise of antisemitism. When word spreads that there is a spy in the French army it only makes sense that it must be a Jew. \nDreyfus as a rabbit about to be stewed.Down with the Jews. Death to the Jews. The anger of the population is boiling, misplaced though it may be, they are convinced that the Jews in some way, some mystical fashion, contributed to the defeat in 1870. As Picquart continues to investigate Esterhazy, finding more and more evidence that he is a much better candidate to be the German spy than Dreyfus, it becomes apparent that his commanding officers, a covey of white haired generals, are not interested in reopening the Dreyfus case. Picquart is inexplicably reassigned to a unit in Tunisia. The Siberia of French outposts. \nGeorges Picquart in his Tunisian Uniform.Finally after months of idleness with no word on when he can return to Paris, he requests a weeks leave and returns to Paris to turn over all his information to his lawyer who then takes that information to the man of impeccable character who also happens to be wealthy enough to withstand bribes or threats, Senator Auguste Scheurer-Kestner. The French generals start to act guilty. Strange, potentially incriminating cables are sent to Picquart. He is arrested and brought up on a series of charges. Emile Zola, a great advocate of Dreyfus and Picquart, is put on trial and convicted to a year in prison. The truth proves to be such a dangerous thing to know. \nEmile Zola was sentenced to prison for the zeal in which he called for Dreyfus to be released. He escaped to England one step ahead of men coming to arrest him.Picquart, when he discovers a mounting level of evidence that more than pokes holes in the flimsy conviction of Dreyfus, but actually completely destroys the case against Dreyfus, his first thought is that all of it needed to be brought into the light of day and dealt with before the newspapers get wind of the incongruities infesting the evidence against Dreyfus. After all a secret never remains a secret. There is little one can do especially in this time period when the power of an organization as formidable as the army decides to fabricate charges against a citizen, backed by a population who wants to see a Jew convicted and wants to see Picquart broken for trying to defend a Jew. Imprisoned Picquart feels a strange sense of relief. The secrets are no longer just his secrets. His needs are simple. He merely needs to feed the mind. \u201dIf my enemies on the General Staff imagine that this represents some kind of hardship for me, they are mistaken. I have a bed and a chair, pen and paper, and plenty of books---Goethe, Heine, Ibsen, Proust kindly sends me his collected writings, Les Plaisirs et les Jours; my sister a new French-Russian dictionary. What more does a man want? I am imprisoned and liberated.\u201dAs a reader, if I have access to books, I\u2019m almost impossible to imprison. Books allow me to be anywhere I want to be. Gray damp walls may surround me, iron bars might grid my vision, but my mind can always fly. Picquart as a way to relax translates Fyodor Dostoyevsky into French. I liked and respected Picquart, but when I learned that nugget of information I came close to having a man crush. Robert Harris and I have a long relationship going back to his first novel Fatherland, where he explored the idea of what the world would have been like if Hitler had won WW2. Picking up a Harris book for me has always been a sure thing. In this book he puts us in the mind of Picquart we see his fallacies, his doubts, his courage, his outrage, and ultimately his determination to find justice. His expectations for France are idealistic. No one would have faulted him for losing faith in the country and the army he loves. He never falters in his desire to remind them of how a man of honor and valor is expected to conduct himself.

While France was still stunned by the victory of the Germans in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, hostilities, distrust and anti-Semitism were all heightened within the military and the people of the republic at the time this novel takes place, the 1890s. As a Jew, an officer within the army, and a man to be secretly envied due to his independent wealth, Captain Dreyfus was an easy target to accuse of treason when French secret intelligence discovered a traitor in their midst. Major Georges Picquart was not immune to the feelings of bitterness and prejudices at the time of Dreyfus\u2019s conviction. Having personally witnessed Dreyfus\u2019s military degradation which was attended by citizens and servicemen alike, Picquart was only too glad to put his former student out of his mind once and for all. \"I had no desire to see the condemned man again. Only two years earlier he had been a student of mine in this very building. Now I had nothing to say to him; I felt nothing for him; I wished he had never been born and I wanted him gone \u2013 from Paris, from France, from Europe.\" Picquart even gets a promotion to Colonel following the degradation and conviction and is assigned to the position of commander of the Statistical Section, the secret intelligence branch of the French Army. Despite the fact that Picquart does not relish espionage, something he considers dirty work, he resigns himself to his new post and devotes himself to his new responsibilities. When Picquart unearths a spy in their midst, he will begin to meticulously probe into the details of the Dreyfus case himself. When a series of mistakes and subsequent cover-ups are revealed, Picquart is forced to choose between his reputation and career or the pursuit of justice. In this pursuit, Picquart learns that he will not have the support of the army and he too will fall under suspicion as his loyalties to the army are tested. \"The thing is, I have no wish to destroy my career. Twenty-four years it has taken me to get this far. Yet my career will be pointless to me \u2013 will lose the very elements of honour and pride that make it worth having\u2026\"An Officer and a Spy is an extremely riveting account of the Dreyfus affair, as it came to be known, the people involved \u2013 including those that will cover their tracks at all costs and those that will seek justice no matter the price, and the eventual reveal of the entire truth as discovered by Picquart. I was completely engaged in this book and couldn\u2019t read fast enough once I reached the halfway mark. Not that it was dull in the first half, not by any means. We are just provided with the background of the case and the details surrounding the trial before the action, so to speak, begins. All of it was very interesting. It is appalling to think of the punishment meted out to Dreyfus following his conviction \u2013 that of solitary confinement at the penal colony on Devil\u2019s Island. The lengths that even the highest ranking officers will follow to persecute a man and to protect their own reputations is shocking to say the least. The anti-Semitism depicted during this period seems a premonition of the evil times to come during the reign of Hitler, and it shows just how such a horrendous event as the Holocaust could eventually come to fruition. However, you will find that there are those that will stand up and do the right thing. For that we can be grateful as our faith in humanity can be restored thanks to individuals such as these. I highly recommend this book to those that relish superb historical fiction as well as those that enjoy spy thrillers and mysteries."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "Who should read this book?- All who love spy novels- All who love mysteries and thrillers- All who are interested in the Dreyfus affair- All who are interested in issues concerning anti-Semitism- All who enjoy \nGOOD\nhistorical fiction- All who would enjoy a book set in Paris in the 1890s- All interested in \u00c9mile Zola or his essay J'accuse !- All who want books that deliver historical facts in an engaging manner- All who need a book that focuses on people that are willing to place themselves in danger for a cause they believe in. Keep in mind that Georges Picquart was a real person and of course Dreyfus and Emile Zola and\u2026. Picquart wanted justice; to achieve justice he was willing to put himself in danger, sacrifice his own career and even life. How many people do that? This book is an anti-depressant when you are you are feeling down-and- out.and for those of you who love audiobooks with excellent narration David Rintoul's reading is simply superb! The icing on the cake. You do \nnot\n have to meet all the criteria above; any one of the criteria above is sufficient reason to choose this book. Do you hear my enthusiasm? I absolutely loved this book. I have a new hero - Georges Picquart. What an amazing man. The topic of the book is interesting. The author turns historical figures into people you feel empathy for. The author presents historical facts, and never are they dry. He starts the book with a brief explanation of what is fact and what fiction. He draws the feel of Paris in the 1890s. And of course there are love affairs, soir\u00e9es, the gas lights and the ever present stench of the sewage, rats and filth. It is all here. To top it all off David Rintoul speaks French as the French do - the names, the streets the buildings, the squares. Men AND women - his intonations are perfect for both. You have never heard his narrations? That is another reason to choose this audiobook - simply to hear the marvelous narration. I loved this book and it restored my faith in the genre historical fiction (which had been going down the drain). The ending is magnificent too; sorry, I keep thinking of things I must mention.And Georges Picquart - I ADORE him.

I knew that Alfred Dreyfus was a French soldier who was accused of spying on France for the Germans. I was born and raised Jewish, so it was also part of my heritage to recognize the persecuted Jews of the past. Harris\u2019s novel awakened my understanding of the political and social climate of that period in history, and informed me of how this colossal miscarriage of justice was authorized, permitted\u2014concocted! And the blatant antisemitism of the time sanctioned the demonization of Dreyfus.I am an avid novel reader, and historical milestones/events \u201cstick\u201d better if it is chronicled in a novel, where I can engage with the characters and narrative structure. Harris\u2019s book both edified and entertained me on the Alfred Dreyfus affair. It alternated between reflective and dramatic action, as the author constructed a suspenseful spy story that also happened to be credible. He states in the Author\u2019s Note that he used his imagination to dramatize some events, invent personal details, and cut out some figures entirely. However, he remained faithful to the truth.Georges Picquart, the principal character and narrator, is a Major who served at the \u00c9cole Militaire as a professor of topography. Dreyfus had been his student a few years back. After he attends Dreyfus\u2019s degradation ceremony (stripping of his military honor), the Major receives a promotion to Colonel (at 40, he would be the youngest), and directed to command the Statistical Section (espionage).\u201cEspionage is grubby work,\u201d he thinks. \u201cEverything I have seen of the Dreyfus case has reinforced that view. It isn\u2019t what I joined the army to do.\u201dHowever, as a patriot and devoted army officer, he has no choice but to accept. Early on, we learn that Pacquart played a minor role in Dreyfus\u2019s apprehension, but Harris teases the facts out gradually, providing an air of mystery that heightens as the story progresses. As Pacquart uncovers sinister lies and conspiracies related to the Dreyfus case, he begins to keep his own counsel, and demonstrates what an adept spy he really is. The fallout from that threatens his career, and possibly his life.One of the most intriguing characters in this story is Dreyfus himself. As described by Harris--inability to observe social cues, poor eye contact, idiosyncrasies, lack of facial expression, and impaired social communication--he would likely be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder if he lived in contemporary times. (This is not stated in the book--autism is my professional specialty, and I recognize the traits). Is this relevant? Possibly so, as it made him unsavory to the French public (beyond his Jewishness). He failed to elicit their sympathy.This is my first Harris book. It took me a few chapters to engage; he isn\u2019t literary\u2014his prose is plain-spoken (and sometimes just plain). However, his pacing is excellent, and the structure is measured and tight. Ultimately, the prose works, and nuances deepen. It\u2019s a subdued nail-biter by a superb storyteller."}, {"userName": "Andrew Smith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith", "userReview": "In 1898 the French newspaper L\u2019Aurore printed an open letter from writer Emile Zola. Under the banner headline \u2019J\u2019accuse\u2026!\u2019, Zola accused the government of anti-Semitism and the unlawful jailing of French Army officer Alfred Dreyfus. The letter caused a huge a uproar, as Zola pointed out the serious errors in the case against Dreyfus \u2013 who had been packed off to the notorious Devil\u2019s Island in French Guyana - and a lack of serious evidence to back up the charges.The Dreyfus Affair, as it became known, was a part of European history that had passed me by up to this point. But in this dramatisation \u2013 viewed through the eyes of Georges Picquart, the head of a French clandestine intelligence unit \u2013 Harris brings events surrounding this famous miscarriage of justice to life. Dreyfus had been found guilty of passing secrets to the Germans, but Picquart starts to believe there\u2019s something seriously wrong when he stumbles across another army officer who he believes is the real spy in the camp. The dialogue is, of course, simply the authors way of bringing the story to the page, but the events and the identity of the historical players are, we are led to believe, historically correct. In fact, the whole thing is broken down into what constitutes a forensic examination of all the key components. It's comprehensive and it\u2019s compelling.Harris really does this sort of thing so well. I do like a bit of history and when it's served up in this style it really does make the consumption of a protracted and complicated event so much more fun. Excellent stuff - I'm off to seek out more of his work."}, {"userName": "Jan Rice", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice", "userReview": "I heard the whip crack twice. The driver shouted a command. The wagon accelerated free of the mob, turned left, and disappeared.An instant later the order was given for the parade to march past. The stamp of boots seemed to shake the ground. Bugles were blown. Drums beat time. As the band struck up \"Sambre-et-Meuse\" it started to snow. I felt a great sense of release. I believe we all did. Spontaneously we turned to one another and shook hands. It was as if a healthy body had purged itself of something foul and pestilential, and now life could begin anew. (pp. 12-13)Both papers have the degradation on their front pages--the Journal, indeed, has almost nothing else. Its report is illustrated by a series of crude sketches: of Dreyfus being marched into the parade ground, of the plump little official in his cape reading out the judgment, of the insignia being ripped from Dreyfus's uniform, and of Dreyfus himself looking like a white-haired old man at thirty-five. The headline is \"The Expiation\": We demanded for the traitor Dreyfus the supreme penalty. We continue to believe that the only appropriate punishment is death...\" It is as if all the loathing and recrimination bottled up since the defeat of 1870 has found an outlet in a single individual. (pp. 21-22)\nThis rendition of the Dreyfus affair recounts how one of those men who at first was as convinced of Dreyfus' guilt as anyone became his preeminent backer and defender after discovering his innocence. The book's main character--the titular officer and spy--is not Alfred Dreyfus but Georges Picquart, who is both that defender and the narrator. Picquart's character development (as well as what will happen next) constitutes a big part of the thrill in this historical fiction, since, after all, the reader is likely to have some basic knowledge of the history.I didn't know, though, about the backdrop of the public-as-Greek-chorus ravening for Dreyfus' blood because of who he was--the story with Dreyfus-as-guilty-party perfectly meeting society's needs.I didn't know how to think about the French army in those days, either. Today I heard an American military chief giving a news conference. He was so careful at each turn to defer to the Secretary of Defense. The French army in the last five years of the 19th century was more like the Egyptian army, the way we think of it today. No doubt that's a clumsy analogy, but the army was France. The army couldn't have a traitor, and if it did, that traitor had to be someone who was not \"really\" French. And once the traitor role had been assigned, the needs of the army took precedence over any other truth. So we see what it's like to go up against power--why everybody says he or she would have spoken out about the child abuser within the sports or religious monolith, or any other wrong within a power structure, and why, mostly, that doesn't happen.\n\"You want my advice? Well here's a story. When my regiment was in Hanoi, there was a lot of thieving in the barracks. So one day my major and I, we laid a trap and we caught the thief red-handed. It turned out he was the son of the colonel--God knows why he needed to steal from the likes of us, but he did it. Now my major--he was a bit like you, a little bit of the idealistic type, shall we say--he wanted this man prosecuted. The top brass disagreed. Still, he went ahead and brought the case anyway, But at the court-martial it was my major that was broken.\" (p. 227)\nOnce we think we have the solution to some puzzle or crime, that's all we can see. We have on blinders. We are virtually blind to other possibilities. Especially if part of what we can see has to do with how our bread is buttered.I'm currently in the midst of another book, Plato at the Googleplex: Why Philosophy Won't Go Away, in which the current topic is morality. Does politics dictate what the good is? That was certainly the overwhelmingly majority opinion in circa 1895 France.This book has got me comparing and contrasting scapegoat versus salvific martyr. Intermixed with the expiation-of-evil theme is Picquart's reference to Dreyfus' degradation as \"his Calvary.\" Later, after Picquart has become convinced of Dreyfus' innocence, he is reflecting on the heaping on of abuse he reads of Dreyfus experiencing in his solitary confinement on Devil's Island:\nI have seen what the chafing of leg irons can do to a prisoner's flesh: cut it to the bone. In the insect-infested heat of the tropics, the torment must be unendurable. (p. 229)\nIt seems that behind the judges in every court in which Dreyfus is tried is a painting of the crucifixion or the like.Is the difference between scapegoat and martyr dependent on the perspective of the viewer? Is it okay for the needs of a society to trump truth and justice if the role of the martyr is as sacrificial lamb rather than scapegoat? In that case do those needs dictate morality? Does politics rule? Or, as my other author says was true for Plato, is it the other way around: does morality dictate what politics should be?Before I started reading, I felt like avoiding this book. I had recommendations for some actual histories rather than historical fiction. But after reading a number of Goodreads reviews about those other possibilities, I saw that those other books were heavy historical tomes, and it just wouldn't do to take on another one of those, bogged down in several as I already am. So An Officer and a Spy it was. And I must say it was quite a read, fast and enjoyable. Thriller lovers will love it, plus it's well-written. And, as I say, thought-provoking, too. I'm going to say 4 1/2 stars and round up to 5.For more information, here's Adam Gopnik writing in The New Yorker on Dreyfus (from 2009): http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/200...August 25, 2014: This article taken from current events (in eastern Ukraine) so reflected the feeling from the degradation of Dreyfus as communicated by Robert Harris that I decided to include the link.September 5, 2014: An Officer and a Spy won the 2014 Walter Scott Prize, a British literary award for historical fiction. I see from the Wikipedia entry that Robert Harris also won for one of his previous books.May 8, 2015: The Spring 2015 issue of Jewish Review of Books contains three articles dealing with antisemitism in France because of current events: the Charlie Hebdo killings and attacks on Jews there. One of the articles is about this book, An Officer and a Spy, which recently has been released in paperback. The other two articles aren't locked, and I'll see about posting them later in appropriate spots. Unfortunately this one is locked. Here's the link, but I don't think nonsubscribers can open it, so I'm going to hit the high points if I can. Also in the past I've been able to make and email a pdf. http://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articl...The author, Steven Englund, says that post-Charlie Hebdo etc., people are looking to An Officer and a Spy for understanding of current-day France, which he says is unfortunate. Also, he says the ordinary understanding of \"the Dreyfus affair\" boils down to the targeting of a Jewish army officer by an antisemitic society. He says it wasn't that simple, and it wasn't so much religious as political. He cites three factors: The army--and the republic--were in a sort of reactionary state of bluster and (reactionary nationalism?) after the military drubbing of 1870. The church-state rivalry had been ramped up again, with Catholics thrown into a defensive posture, leading to grassroots antisemitism over the affair (although not from the Catholic hierarchy itself). And, finally, the Third Republic was too weak to deal directly with crises. As a result:The Affair became politicized, then highly politicized, as it became clear that all sides on the contentious French public scene could use it to do their old business destroying each other's reputations.Englund denies that the Affair and obsession with it contorted all France. He says Drumont was the sole major French antisemite with a bunch of adolescent and n'er do well followers who have been mistakenly writ large by hisotry. He says anti-Jewish riots were small affairs that don't measure up to what we imagine. He says their main success was in projecting the myth that the Army's reputation was tied to that of a few criminal officers. Eventually, forthcoming disclosures and support \"empowered a craven and weak government to act, and presently the Affair ended.\"The preceding paragraph may not be too clear to me, but the following is: The Affair as we think of it was a later construction. It didn't turn on \"the Jewish question\" but on the rights of the state (raison d'\u00c9tat) versus those of citizens (civil rights?). It gave the much, much more antisemitic countries of Austria and Russia talking points against France. France was democratic and eventually did the right thing, but also had citizens who took polemical advantage of the freedom of expression there. All the Christianity-derived European countries of that time period where characterized by antisemitism, with far less in the French Third Republic.I don't think Englund intends his article as an apology for antisemitism in France, so if what you read here looks that way, it could be me. I think he wants to avoid an oversimplified rendition, and would like to get that straight before piling further analysis on top of what's there.Steven Englund is the author of Napoleon: A Political Life. It is highly regarded, particularly in France; and Englund has a Wikipedia page in French but not in English. He's currently working on a book that compares political antisemitism in Germany, Austria-Hungary, and France."}, {"userName": "Dolf Patijn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3303223-dolf-patijn", "userReview": "Robert Harris has done it again. He has written a historical novel that dragged me in so deep that it made me feel uncomfortable as if I was the protagonist. Nail-biting stuff. This time the book is about the Dreyfus affair, a real historic event that took place in between 1894 and 1906.The story is told by Colonel Georges Picquart, who becomes head of counter-espionage and finds out that there is something really fishy about the whole affair.This affair had the whole country (France) devided at the time. One of the supporters of Dreyfus was the writer \u00c9mile Zola.Part two of the book in particular is exciting and from then on the book is hard to put down.This story shows that anti-semitism was very much alive around that time in France. It also shows that politics have always had a dirty side to it. (Robert Harris already showed that in the two Cicero books as well)With Pompeii, the two books about Cicero, Enigma, Archangel and now an officer and a spy, Robert Harris has proven to be one of the best writers of historical fiction. I'm already looking forward to his next book. Hopefully it will be the third book in his Cicero trilogy but if not, I won't complain as everything I've read of his work so far has been brilliant.

I don't blame you if you know nothing of this event as it was unknown to me when I open the novel. Fans of political thriller, historical fiction and history should find this to be a perfect mesh of genres. While I remain unable to separate the fact from the author's fiction, further investigation leads me to believe this is reasonably accurate version of events. Plot summary In 1894 a Captain in the French Army by the name of Alfred Dreyfus was arrested, charge with selling secrets to the Germans, convicted of Treason and sent to serve an inhuman sentence on Devil's Island in French Guiana. The conviction was based on a compilation of poor evidence, anti-Semitism, political pressure and anti-German sentiment. Soon after the conviction, Georges Picquart takes over as the head of the intelligence branch of the Army where he comes to have serious doubts regarding the guilt of Dreyfus. Given the political climate in France and the implications of his discoveries, Picquart does not know whom he can trust and engages in an investigation that may never have a satisfactory resolution. The Good  An Eye for History Like the best Historical Fiction, the author has a keen eye for the period and historical accuracy. The story felt properly situation within the time period. The mannerism and speech felt appropriate and little felt out of place. The author also exploring the rampant anti-Semitism that was running through France at the time. This theme was dealt with in a deft manner and never turned into a political statement. It simply came off as an honest description of the attitude of the French during these years. The Story is not Bad Either The Dreyfus Affair was a complex and divisive matter in its day. It is no less complex today. The author was masterful in the manner in which he was able to distill the varying reasons for the affair and elegantly lay them out in cohesive manner. This is by no means a \"light and fluffy\" read. In is multilayered and by its nature is filled with unsatisfactory answers. Amongst the complexities, the story does an admirable job of introducing the reader the counter-intelligence methods of the period. While the novel describes the intelligence branch as the future of the Army the methods used were equally crude, impressive and ripe for misuse. The Bad  Let's Get to know Each Other If I have anything negative to say it is that I was a bit disappointed with the development of George Piquart. The character was obviously conflicted through out the story and I would have enjoyed if the author had explored that theme. I appreciate that this may have been deliberate and at any rate, it is a minor complaint. One other issue was the audiobook itself. David Rintoul is a top notch narrator and I take no issue with his performance. I simply question why the narrator is British and not French? The majority of audiobooks use the local accents with their novels. There was not a single French accent to be heard. Can this Book Stand Alone Yes. This is not part of a series Final Thoughts Some readers will find the pace to be far too slow. Personally, I am a fan of the meandering novel and I did not take issue with the pacing. This is simply a warning to prospective readers. While the intrigue continued to string me along, it was not blistering action and thrills that propelled my interest. The novel is complex, deals with serious issues of politics, legal systems and prejudice. In my opinion, is a Thriller in the best sense.   Content Advisories  It is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. *Disclaimer* I do not take note or count the occurrences of adult language as I read. I am simply giving approximations.Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex  -  2 A subplot involves an extramarital affair. There are several secret rendezvous throughout the story but the sex is generally implied and is not graphic.  Language  -  2 The adult language is generally very mild as many of the interactions are between officers and their superiors. As such, the language is often formal and leaves little room for adult language. Violence  -  2.5 There is some violence in the form of suicides/murders. They are simply discovered and the description are moderately graphic. The situation of Richard Dreyfus is discussed from time to time and his living conditions are, at best, squalid. Some readers my find the mental torture inflicted to be disturbing. Outside of this, physical violence is low."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41609617-james", "userReview": "Classic Robert Harris - brilliant historical fiction based on the infamous 'Dreyfus affair'.

So I didn't start this novel with any degree of confidence that it would appeal to me. Like many others, I was familiar with only the bare bones of the Dreyfus Affair: (a) Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French army officer, was convicted of selling information to the Germans. (b) He was imprisoned on the notorious Devil's Island, but was ultimately exhonerated. (c) His case is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice of all time.Harris' novel conveniently fills in the blanks in my knowledge of the Dreyfus Affair, but not by making Dreyfus the main focus of the tale. Instead, the officer and spy of the title is Georges Picquart, a minor player in the Dreyfus trial who is later appointed head of military intelligence, has access to information that convinces him that Dreyfus is innocent and ultimately turns whistleblower. This is a well-written, but not a particularly literary novel. The prose is competent, even though it does contain some trite metaphors and similes, and the narrative is well-structured. While Harris takes a few liberties with history, I gather that the narrative is essentially historically accurate. Thankfully, he avoids annoying information dumps and As-you-know-Bob moments. Harris is able to convey the atmosphere of anti-Semitism that was rampant in French society in the late 1890s, the fear and loathing of Germany which was a legacy of the Franco-Prussian War and the willingness of the military and political elite to perpetuate a grave miscarriage of justice rather than admit that they were wrong. For anyone with an interest in pre-WWI European history this is a great entr\u00e9e into the Dreyfus affair.That Harris makes the novel work as a thriller even though it's easy enough to find out what happened by checking Wikipedia or some other source, says a lot about his story-telling skill. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the audiobook version and it's made me want to read more about Dreyfus, Piquart and the Dreyfus Affair. To that end, I've ordered Dreyfus: A Family Affair 1798 1945. However, I intend to find other books to read as well.

This is a fictionalized account of what is generally called the Dreyfus affair. Beginning in 1894 and continuing through 1906 Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused and unjustly imprisoned on Devil's Island. (Devil's Island was closed so Dreyfus was held alone.) Through the efforts of a relentless investigator and with the help of writer \u00c9mile Zola the truth finally came out. The book is told from the view point of Georges Picquart who risked his career and to some extent his life when (in his capacity as chief of the army's intelligence section) he uncovered facts that not only proved another man guilty as a spy but cleared Dreyfus.There were problems however. You see the guilty party was a \"French Gentleman\" and Dreyfus was a Jew. Also clearing Dreyfus would show that the army general staff had been, well....wrong. Couldn't have that.So the French Army's top ranks pulled together to suppress any evidence of Dreyfus' innocence and of Esterhazy's (Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy, who called himself Count Esterhazy) guilt.I was already familiar with the details of this case as I'd become interested in it some years ago. There is at least one creditable movie about it and some documentaries as well as notable historical writings. This is a novel about one of the best known spy cases in history that also involves antisemitism, conspiracy and what almost amounted to a coup of the French government.The book is more than creditably written. It's interesting with the facts laid out in such a way that it reads like a novel. Whether you're familiar with this case or not I recommend this book. It is fictionalized, but the events are historical. I'd hazard that the only truly imaginary parts may be the conversations. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "At the end of the 19th century France was consumed by an incident called The Dreyfus Affair where a man called Alfred Dreyfus was caught allegedly giving French military secrets to Germany. Robert Harris\u2019 An Officer and a Spy, which is set directly in the aftermath of Dreyfus\u2019 conviction, revisits the affair from the perspective of Georges Picquart, the newly appointed spymaster of French Intelligence, who discovers not only that Dreyfus was innocent but that there was a massive conspiracy behind the framing.I usually like Harris\u2019 novels (I highly recommend The Ghost and The Fear Index - great thrillers) so I was disappointed at how crap An Officer and a Spy turned out to be. At 600 pages it\u2019s longer than Harris\u2019 usual books and you definitely feel its length. Long-winded is a good description of this story rather than the misnomer \u201cthriller\u201d.Part of the problem is our protagonist, Picquart, who comes off as very standoffish, cold and unlikeable - because of him it always feels like we\u2019re experiencing the story from a distance and can\u2019t get too involved with it. Dreyfus, despite the novel being basically about him, is kept off page for the most part and we never get to know him, making everything that happens feel sort of abstract. The other characters - and there are a lot of supporting characters, mostly military officers - feel identical and one-dimensional. Harris doesn\u2019t do a good job of providing context for the story. I wasn\u2019t at all familiar with the Dreyfus Affair before reading this and some detail on why Alsace-Lorraine was so contested between France and Germany, and Dreyfus\u2019 relevance with that background, would\u2019ve been useful. He does mention that Germany annexed that land in the last French/German war of 1870 but he doesn\u2019t go further and connect that to Dreyfus and why he did what he supposedly did. Then there\u2019s the Affair itself - Dreyfus allegedly giving French artillery secrets to the Germans isn\u2019t a very interesting angle to me at all. I understood its importance, I just didn\u2019t care. Then we get into the trial and its particulars and it becomes maddeningly convoluted and tedious to recount. Generally speaking it is a fascinating story, all the more so given that it\u2019s non-fiction. It\u2019s a massive case of injustice, people are conveniently knocked off, there\u2019s a lot of cloak and daggers, and Picquart was an immensely brave and moral man - Dreyfus too - for enduring such harshness. But Harris\u2019 treatment of it all renders the drama stale and unexciting, not to mention repetitive as the same details are dredged up again and again during endless trials. I\u2019m sure there are better accounts of the Dreyfus Affair - the material is so rich with intrigue, someone\u2019s bound to have spun it into narrative gold somewhere - but Robert Harris\u2019 fictional take on it is definitely not one of them."}, {"userName": "Lewis Weinstein", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein", "userReview": "An outstanding historical novel, recreating the Dreyfus affair in a way that raised my fury ... at disgusting official misconduct and coverup ... and at blatant antisemitism.

I rather felt the story a bit dry, not boring, but just not overly fascinating to read. I felt it took quite a long time for anything to happen. However, that's actually necessary when it came to telling this story. However, towards the end of the book, everything turns on its head and that's thanks to the slowness of the story.The book is well written (despite my moaning about the dryness). Robert Harris has written a great book that's a bit horrible to read. Horrible, because it's based on a real event and horrible because it shows the deep hatred against Jews in France during the end of the 19-century and the beginning of the 20-century.I would say that An Officer and a Spy is an important book to read from a historical perspective. I suspect that the Dreyfus affair is something not everyone is aware of and this book about how an innocent man could be charged with treason because of falsified evidence and a dubious trial procedure is important to read.Thanks to Bookmarks f\u00f6rlag for the review copy!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "I wonder if there is anything more frightening than the misuse of great power against someone who is helpless to defend himself. If you have even been close to such a circumstance, it is harrowing. To have it done to you on such a great scale as experienced by Alfred Dreyfus is almost unthinkable. Add in a generous sprinkling of antisemitism, and you have more than the persecution of an individual, you have the precursor of things to come. For that reason, The Dreyfus Affair, as this episode of French history has come to be known, still figures, not only as a shameful part of French history, but as a major historic event.This tale, however, is not the tale of Alfred Dreyfus alone. It is more importantly the tale of Colonel Georges Picquart, a man whose honor and sense of justice would not allow him to look the other way and whose involvement was thrust upon him by circumstances beyond his control. Although most of us who have any familiarity with The Dreyfus Affair at all are aware of Emile Zola\u2019s involvement, the name of Col. Picquart was completely new and unknown to me. I am so pleased to have heard this man\u2019s story, because I consider it the hardest of all things to stand for what is right when everyone around you turns the other way and encourages you to do the same. Harder still when you have so much to lose and nothing to gain. Difficult to do when you are in defense of someone you love and admire; nearly impossible when the other individual is not your intimate and in many ways unappealing to you even as a friend or associate.If you believe in Karma, this book is fraught with it. Knowing that it is based on factual events makes it all the more compelling. As a bonus, Robert Harris has a marvelous writing style and sets the story in motion with mystery and spy craft and intrigue that is captivating. I enjoyed every moment and will not hesitate to read Mr. Harris again."}, {"userName": "David Ebsworth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8272226-david-ebsworth", "userReview": "This is the best book I\u2019ve read in the past year by a long head. It\u2019s very rare for me to say \u201cI couldn\u2019t put this down\u201d though, in this case, I literally finished it in two long sittings.Opening: \u2018Major Picquart to see the Minister of War...\u2019 The sentry on the rue Saint-Dominique steps out of his box to open the gate and I run through a whirl of snow across the windy courtyard into the warm lobby of the h\u00f4tel de Brienne, where a sleek young captain of the Republican Guards rises to salute me. I repeat, with greater urgency: \u2018Major Picquart to see the Minister of War...!\u2019When I was a boy, in the \u201950s, the best book on my father\u2019s shelves was a large volume called Fifty Great Disasters & Tragedies that Shocked the World. Tales of the Titanic, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Black Hole of Calcutta. But the chapter that I came back to, over and over, was the one dealing with a certain Alfred Dreyfus. It was my first exposure to the potentially vindictive and conspiratorial nature of the State - albeit I probably wouldn\u2019t have used those words at the time and the State in question was France, of course. Perish the thought that a British Government could have been capable of such dishonesty and anti-Semitic evil as the French dished out to Captain Dreyfus in 1895.But this is actually the lesser-known story of Georges Picquart, from the army\u2019s Statistical Section, the intelligence unit that originally exposed Dreyfus as a spy and managed his trial. The result was a barbaric public humiliation of Dreyfus in front of a Parisian crowd, twenty thousand strong, shouting \u201cDeath to the Jew!\u201d Dreyfus is shipped off to Devil\u2019s Island and treated with savage inhumanity while Picquart begins to stumble across clues suggesting that all may not be entirely as it seems with the verdict. You sometimes have to pinch yourself to remember that the treatment of Dreyfus is factually accurate - and the same is true of Picquart\u2019s journey to establish the truth. French novelist \u00c9mile Zola may have taken much of the credit for exposing that truth, but it\u2019s Picquart - himself a somewhat conflicted character - who shines through as this tale\u2019s true hero.The book is beautifully written, even by the standards of Robert Harris.

That\u2019s the lesson to take from Robert Harris\u2019 masterful An Officer and a Spy. It is a skillfully-crafted novelization of the Dreyfus Affair, which paralyzed France for about ten years at the turn of the twentieth century. Harris relied on the facts of the case to build his novel of espionage, deceit, bigotry and state-sanctioned misdeeds. He wrote in an author\u2019s note: \u201cNone of the characters\u2026not even the most minor, is wholly fictional.\u201d He dexterously wove a superb historical novel from the pages of history itself. If there is any criticism due the novel, it is a flagging of narrative impetus about three-quarters of the way through it. This is understandable. The Dreyfus Affair ended, not with a bang, but a whimper. The French Republic only gradually made things right in restoring Captain Dreyfus and Colonel Picquart to their proper and honorable positions.An Officer and a Spy is one of the best historical novels I have read in quite some time.

To his surprise and then horror, and despite his investigations being initially encouraged, the more it becomes clear that Dreyfus has been wrongly convicted the more his superiors, peers and subordinates in political, military and secret service circles seek to prevent his enquiries, resorting first to exiling him and then to blackmail and arrest as the affair increasingly divides a smaller group of Dreyfus adherents (including his family, left wing politicians, and literary figures such as Zola) from the majority of the establishment who see any attempt to clear Dreyfus as an attack on the military and the state. We follow the story through Picquart's exile to Africa, his heavy decision to leak details of his investigations to the Dreyfus adherents and a series of dramatic set-piece trials (Esterhazy's court-martial, Zola's libel suit, Dreyfus's retrial) where in each case and in defiance of the evidence the courts find against Picquart/Dreyfus (astonishingly in the last case as much of the anti-Dreyfus case had by then collapsed); with the eventual slow rehabilitation of Dreyfus and Picquart then playing out non-dramatically over a few years at the end of the book.A really gripping book largely following the true events with some simplifications, but even then with a series of coincidences, confusing twists, unlikely outcomes, a sometimes bewildering cast of characters which if not true would make the story seem impossible. The book conveys extremely well the political developments in France which ultimately dictated the events of World War I (the tensions with Germany over the occupation of Alsace, the fear of their superior population and hence manpower and hence the need for: early mobilisation; a military biased society; the alliance with Tsarist Russia despite the clear political incompatibility). The character of Picquart and his competing tendencies (his ambition which leads to him becoming the youngest ever Colonel in the army, his fierce patriotism and anti-German feelings as an Alsatian exile, his sense of correctness and honour in matters of state and law, his ambiguous personal life with two mistresses - one married and reluctance for marriage) is a key and important part of the book.The initial development of espionage (made possible by inventions such as the telegrams, early photography) and the growing powers it gives the secret service to monitor private correspondence and the abuses that gives rise to (as well as the demonisation as unpatriotic and damaging to the safety of the realm of those who seek to uncover those abuses) have dramatic parallels in the recent events of the Snowdon revelations."}, {"userName": "Geevee", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5153787-geevee", "userReview": "A very enjoyable, keenly researched and fast paced historical account of the Dreyfus affair that shook France and transfixed Europe in the final years of the 19th Century.

Venerable French novelist Emile Zola was charged with libel (and might have been murdered) for standing on the side of Picquart and justice.What makes Picquart's and Zola's feat of taking on the nation's Army a mission impossible can be found in this speech by the French President:\"The army is the nation's heart and soul, the mirror in which France perceives the most ideal image of her self-denial and patriotism; the army holds the first place in the thoughts of the government and in the pride of the country.\"It is stated in the Author's Note: \"None of the characters in the pages that follow, not even the most minor, is wholly fictional, and almost all of what occurs, at least in some form, actually happened in real life.\"Need I say more to persuade you to read the novel?"}, {"userName": "Allison", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9371994-allison", "userReview": "An Officer and a Spy is a nail-biting espionage/legal thriller set in France at the turn of the 19th Century, and is slightly outside my comfort zone. I love Historical Fiction, but thrillers are... uncomfortable. They make me tense. I spend a lot of effort trying not to be anxious in real life, so to chase that feeling purposely is maybe a bit silly. I have to knock off a star because \"enjoyment\" isn't a word I can use in relation to such emotions. That said, this is a fantastically written story that probably actually deserves 5 stars if I could get beyond my emotional response to it. What horrifies me the most is that it's a true story. Reality can truly be more cruel than fiction. I felt the despair, the sense of being stamped out by a government for knowing the wrong information, and the outrage at crimes uncovered and injustices committed. Great stuff. I recommend it if historical spy thrillers are your thing. And even if they're not."}, {"userName": "Lewis Weinstein", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein", "userReview": "Outstanding historical fiction, portrays the underlying antisemitism and resulting indifference to mistreatment of Jews that pervaded French society and deflected a proper investigation. The same factors were prevalent throughout much of Europe and surely contributed to Hitler's ability to conduct the Holocaust. The underlying causes of those anti-Jewish attitudes are an important part of my new novel-in-progress."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "This novel shows author, Robert Harris, in top form. It begins with army officer, Georges Picquart, witnessing Captain Alfred Dreyfus - a disgraced fellow officer and convicted spy - being publicly humiliated in front of a baying crowd. Picquart is ambitious but slightly naive. However, as he stands alongside the 'Statistical Section' of the General Staff, he does not doubt that Dreyfus is guilty. The Dreyfus Affair causes immense interest in France, and even the great actress Sarah Bernhardt appears to watch Dreyfus be paraded as a German spy. France's loss of land to Germany, including Picquart's childhood home of Alsace, is still very much within painful memory and Germany is both feared and hated. Still, when Picquart hears that Dreyfus, the slightly dull student who once sat in his classes, is to sent to solitary confinement on Devil's Island, he feels that the punishment is a little, \"Dumas...\"Before long, Picquart is promoted and ordered to command the Statistical Section himself; the 'grubby work' of espionage. Although he is not keen to enter the world of spying, he soon finds that he enjoys the work and that he is good at it. Perhaps too good. When new evidence comes to light, Picquart wonders whether Dreyfus was not lying when he protested his evidence; whether he was, in fact, just a wealthy Jew who became a scapegoat in a terrible miscarriage of justice. Unsure of who he can trust, Picquart has to ask whether his loyalty to his beloved army means that he has to obey orders at the cost of his conscience. The Dreyfus affair is a fascinating historical event and this book; part thriller and part historical fiction, brings the period and the characters wonderfully to life. Immensely enjoyable, this is a novel to lose yourself in and I recommend it highly."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth (Alaska)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska", "userReview": "History lives!I first became aware of the Dreyfus affair by reading a bit of biography of Emile Zola. I freely admit not paying very close attention, only that he was actively involved in some way in opposition to the Government. As I understood it at the time, in doing so, he risked his professional reputation. I remembered the title J'accuse!, but never looked any further.Zola is not the main character in this, but his part is given the importance it deserves. As much Zola as I've read, I wanted more sooner. I quickly came to realize that the story was so much more than Zola. In fact, the story is so much more than the wrongfully accused and convicted, Alfred Dreyfus.This is historical fiction at its finest. It is not period fiction, which is simply stories set in a particular period. The characters in this not only lived in their time, they lived in this novel. In his prefacing author's note, Harris writes: Naturally, however, in order to turn history into a novel, I have been obliged to simplify, to cut out some figures entirely, to dramatise, and to invent many personal details. In particular, Georges Picquart never wrote a secret account of the Dreyfus affair ... For this is the story of Marie-Georges Picquart, a man of incredible honor and honesty. He came to history's attention via the Dreyfus affair."}], "description": "Robert Harris returns to the thrilling historical fiction he has so brilliantly made his own. This is the story of the infamous Dreyfus affair told as a chillingly dark, hard-edged novel of conspiracy and espionage.\nParis in 1895. Alfred Dreyfus, a young Jewish officer, has just been convicted of treason, sentenced to life imprisonment at Devil\u2019s Island, and stripped of his rank in front of a baying crowd of twenty-thousand. Among the witnesses to his humiliation is Georges Picquart, the ambitious, intellectual, recently promoted head of the counterespionage agency that \u201cproved\u201d Dreyfus had passed secrets to the Germans. At first, Picquart firmly believes in Dreyfus\u2019s guilt. But it is not long after Dreyfus is delivered to his desolate prison that Picquart stumbles on information that leads him to suspect that there is still a spy at large in the French military. As evidence of the most malignant deceit mounts and spirals inexorably toward the uppermost levels of government, Picquart is compelled to question not only the case against Dreyfus but also his most deeply held beliefs about his country, and about himself. Bringing to life the scandal that mesmerized the world at the turn of the twentieth century, Robert Harris tells a tale of uncanny timeliness\u2013\u2013a witch hunt, secret tribunals, out-of-control intelligence agencies, the fate of a whistle-blower--richly dramatized with the singular storytelling mastery that has marked all of his internationally best-selling novels.", "title": "An Officer and a Spy", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007532-an-officer-and-a-spy", "average": 4.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1378711003l/18007532.jpg", "reviews": 1936, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/575.Robert_Harris", "name": "Robert   Harris"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Thriller", "Mystery", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007532-an-officer-and-a-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17612687-an-officer-and-a-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18690572-an-officer-and-a-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17456932-an-officer-and-a-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18872934-an-officer-and-a-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18395002-an-officer-and-a-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29856908-en-officer-och-spion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18395003-an-officer-and-a-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18283113-an-officer-and-a-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18364352-an-officer-and-a-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/880.Pompeii", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56842.Fatherland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/243601.Imperium", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29397486-conclave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/843989.Enigma"]}
