You are quite quickly forced to give up any question of whether this is realistic or not, and are given the chance of hearing what these characters would say had they the means to express it.It does also mean that it makes for pretty heavy reading, and this along with the fact it is a 50's translation of early 19th century text was at times enough to leave me feeling a bit lost.I really enjoyed Geoffrey Dunlop's introduction, I so much prefer translators introductions to critics any day. B\u00fcchner's story is fascinating and the historical background that Dunlop gives is lovingly handled if at times a bit overly wordy.The Breadth B\u00fcchner covers with these three plays is impressive, Leonce & Lena is a comedy in an almost Shakespearean vein, Danton's death is political in that it reflects B\u00fcchner's cynical outlook on the politics of his time and the french revolution but at heart is more of a social commentary, and then Wozzeck portraits the stifling hardship of the working classes. But all through these he manages to perfectly fit in his poetic musings on life and death. Throughout all of these stories there is a very definite sympathy with working classes.The thing that is really going to get you with B\u00fcchner is the sheer quality of prose: his stories seem at times a little fragmented but the phrases, reflections and analogies are often astounding. It seems to me in one way a huge loss that B\u00fcchner wrote all of his plays in such a rush and under such stressful circumstances: Leonce & Lena could perhaps be made clearer in order to become the light comedy it should be; Danton's death could be a much more cohesive well rounded story, but perhaps they would not have had nearly the energy had they been crafted over a longer duration.Tempted to give this 5 hmmmmmmmm........."}, {"userName": "Kristy", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/340252-kristy", "userReview": "I started this collection of B\u00fcchner's work for his play Woyzeck, and read everything except Danton's Death (which I'm saving for later). Considering that B\u00fcchner died when he was 23, this collection of three plays, a novella, a revolutionary political treatise, a scientific lecture, and a bunch of letters is rather impressive. What is even more impressive is how modern B\u00fcchner seems considering that he was writing 180 years ago. This collection has crisp translations and interesting introductory material."}, {"userName": "rosalind", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2989778-rosalind", "userReview": "a good translation"}, {"userName": "Keith", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4873736-keith", "userReview": "Woyzeck ***** \u2013 What a lyrically haunting play. It is little more than fragments of story, song and poetry with an unresolved \u2013 or unclear \u2013 ending. When I say \u201cfragments\u201d, I mean that each scene is brief, but almost complete in itself. The story/plot itself is not necessarily fragmented. The arc of it is rather clear and unremarkable (at least by today\u2019s standards). A woman cheats on a troubled man, who kills her when he finds out. But it is told in short, poignant scenes \u2013 some no more than a single line of dialogue. Like Danton\u2019s Death, the language reveals Buchner\u2019s admiration for Shakespeare. It is lyrical, imaginative, heightened, and unnatural. The characters are reflective and philosophical. Folk songs abound. Along with the short, tightly focused scenes, this dialogue creates a sense that each scene is more like a song, lending it an operatic feel.Yet the play is frustratingly incomplete. That\u2019s either its greatest flaw or greatest strength. In this translation by Richard Mueller, Woyzeck is captured alive. The translator believes Buchner would have had a trial scene if he had lived. (No drafts exist that I\u2019m aware of.) The translation by Victor Price, on the other hand, has Woyzeck drown himself when he goes back in the lake to throw away the knife. To him, the play is nearly complete. (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)That\u2019s quite a variation in interpretation. I don\u2019t think Buchner would have added a trial scene. Or, if there were a trial, it would have been offstage. I don\u2019t see how you could stage something like a trial and maintain the same tone and style. Additionally, it would have been too pat of an ending. There\u2019s a sense of shame and degradation throughout the play that seems to argue against a final reckoning or resolution. But who knows. Buchner claimed the play was almost done before he became ill and died. At this point we can only presume what he meant and what he ultimately wanted. (We can, however, make it mean what we want.) Yet there is a greatness in this play, a haunting sense of evil, disintegration and humiliation. It\u2019s unlike any play I\u2019ve read. I strongly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Brendan Shea", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79268-brendan-shea", "userReview": "The best translation out there of the first modern tragedian.
