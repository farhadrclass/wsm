Some are funny, some are weighty, some are near misses. In this one I feel the author was probably just having a lot of fun, and indeed it's a fun, quick read. It's full of small delights -- sixties period detail, word play, eccentric characters, a twisty plot, a metafiction kicker at the end. The book has been sitting on my shelf for a while, and I'm glad I finally bumped it to the head of the list."}, {"userName": "Nicolas Chinardet", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12332247-nicolas-chinardet", "userReview": "This book presents the reader with another occasion to enjoy Levitt's smooth and elegant prose. The loose general struture of it is divided in two overall parts that more or less retell the same events from different perspective and much extra details in the second half. As the such the book feels rather stuck in a loop. Unfortunately all characters read rather like clich\u00e9 and the main character and narrator, in particular, didn't feel that real and verysimilar to me but(SLIGHT SPOILERS) this might be due to the fact that this is a book within a book and the narrator is in fact a character imagined by another writer. The book deals with the ownership of written texts, and I can't help thinking this may be the fruit of ruminations that followed Leavitt's issues with his previous book While England Sleeps. (END OF SPOILERS) It is imperfect but short and on the whole enjoyable. Although certainly not as disastrous as The Page Turner (a misnommer if ever there were one), this is perhaps best saved for the Leavitt die-hard fans (although, in a radical departure from previous efforts, there isn't a single gay character in this one)."}, {"userName": "Noella  Van Looy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54964706-noella-van-looy", "userReview": "Ik had dit boek eens gratis gekregen op het boekenfestijn.

On the fringes of the family unit hovers Judith 'Denny' Denham, the ambiguous narrator of this novel. Her place in the Wright family dynamic is a curious one: she is Ernest Wright's unsung secretary -- also his mistress and Nancy's friend and four-handed piano partner; but forever destined to be an outsider. And so to the central event of the novel: Thanksgiving, 1969 ... This year Nancy Wright's much-lauded friend Anne and her recently acquired second husband, the esteemed novelist Jonah Boyd, will be joining them from New Hampshire. Leavitt works with universal themes: the simple human need to be appreciated and to be brought into account by the people around us; the capricious nature of success and the deviant paths taken in our striving to achieve it; the unstoppable chain reactions that are set in motion with every incautious deed and how the resulting ripple effects from such actions inevitably impact on the lives of all concerned; and the importance of belonging to a place we can call our own. The Body of Jonah Boyd is a stylishly written read in the course of which surprising twists and a fascinating plot segue into a satisfying conclusion with not a single story line left unattended, and all the pieces slotting into place with an elegance and a practiced ease which speak volumes for the author's narrative skills."}, {"userName": "Kristel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1993309-kristel", "userReview": "The Body of Jonah Boyd , a novel by David Leavitt, published in 2004, is a story of the Wright family in Wellspring, California told by Ernest Wright\u2019s secretary, Janet (Denny) Denham. It centers around a Thanksgiving meal in 1969. Ernest Wright is a psychology professor at the local college in Wellspring. This is a fictitious place modeled after Standford University. Denny is Mr. Wright\u2019s secretary and she is invited to a Thanksgiving meal as one of the strays. The Wright\u2019s invite some of the graduate students every year. Nancy finds out that Denny can play four hands at the piano so she becomes a regular visitor on Saturdays. Denny (Judith Denham) is having an affair with Ernest, plays piano with his wife Nancy, becomes Daphne\u2019s and eventually Ben\u2019s confidants and even becomes friend\u2019s with Jonah Boyd\u2019s daughter. In 1969, Nancy\u2019s old friend, Anne who has remarried to an author Jonah Boyd visit. Jonah Boyd carries a single copy of his most recent book around in notebooks even though he is prone to lose them over and over. This is a story about the loss of this manuscript and the consequences that follow. David Leavitt is an American author of several books including The Lost Languages of Cranes which is on the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die list. Leavitt is a professor at the University of Florida. He was sued for plagiarism in 1995. I read this book because it was a recommendation by Nancy Pearl. I purchased the book years ago and finally am getting it read. My book is a first edition. I don\u2019t think it ever sold many copies but it is good. I enjoyed the writing. The story is contemporary story that explores family relationships and sexual struggles with the main theme being the problem of authorship. It is mostly told by an observer who is able to connect with each of the family members to learn their stories. There is the title which creates tension immediately because somehow there is going to be a body. Slowly small points are revealed, constantly building suspense and the reader is pulled along to find out more. The reader does not find out what is the significance of the title until the very end. Leavitt is a good author. Reading his book Lost Languages of Cranes wasn\u2019t high on my list of books I wanted to get to because of the subject matter but now that I have sampled this author I look forward to reading it."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47433413-teresa", "userReview": "[Secondo quello che dice Denny nel suo ruolo di narratrice, lei starebbe solo trascrivendo il romanzo di Ben.

From this experience she gets to know Wright's wife, Nancy, and becomes involved in the lives of the children, particularly the youngest, 15-year-old Ben. The story takes on a new level with the introduction of well-renowned author, Jonah Boyd. Boyd loses the notebooks filled with his latest novel, thus begins a series of twists and turns leading up to a somewhat surprising (but mostly lackluster) ending.The story reads easily but the characters are uninteresting. Leavitt did not do a particularly good job writing from the perspective of an overweight, yet lusty, female secretary of a psychology professor; towards the end of the story the perspective changes from that of Denny to an older Ben Wright, a switch that really falls short and felt overdone. It could have been cleaner which may then have led to perhaps more dimensions to the characters, or at least shown me a reason to care more.However, it wasn't a complete bust. The notebooks symbolize more than just a notebook and Nancy's obsession with the family house, while not fleshed out nearly as much as it could have, added an interesting level to the story. It was a quick read and not nearly horrible enough to make me want to avoid Leavitt in the future."}, {"userName": "Joanne hale", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8921267-joanne-hale", "userReview": "I actually liked this book, starting it i judged too quickly, and almost allowed it to slip through my fingers and back into the return bin of the library.

Its about a family and their run in with the writer Jonah Boyd and how their lives intertwine.And the books. The books, so simple so small yet play the biggest part in the charade that is played. The whole story is built up rather nice, small exciting scenes like the oldest brother draft-dodging to Canada and they all build up to the big climax at the end of the book which is exposed in conversation.Wonderful! would be glad to read anther book by Leavitt, a who done it? without the twisted serial killer.
