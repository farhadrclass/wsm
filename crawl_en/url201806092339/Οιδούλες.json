Genet\u2019s remarkable alchemy, in which the story of a serial killer becomes a kind of paean to murder and Querelle a high poet of murder, resembles the alchemy which Querelle himself undertakes of friends who he betrays but transforms into the gold necklaces, braces and watches which will be his reward for his betrayals. The luscious gold of Genet\u2019s prose, a kind of perverse combination of Flaubert and Baudelaire, is truly original and his descriptive powers are extraordinary;\u201cFor several seconds of the eyes of the murderer marveled at the astounding stillness of the forest, where the vault of hanging creepers gilded by a mysterious sun in a dim yet sparkling air filtered through from immense far-distant blue skies, and where the depths were illuminated by the infinitely variables lights and shades of all walking dreams.\u201dGenet\u2019s imagination is a rough, ghoulish nightmare, dominated by men, muscular and yet strangely feminine, Genet\u2019s dangerous yet decorous heroes intoxicate the reader with their bawdy and bellicose behavior-his descriptions of the sexual relations and intercourse between men would seem banal in any other novel, but here they somehow become beautiful, kind of like if a romance novelist took a heady dose of crack and dealt exclusively in the world of homosexual sailors and police officers-there is something intensely innocent in the sexual relations between the male characters as they approach each other with the attitude of a young virgin. From the bizarre diary of Lieutenant Seblon, to the violent longings of Querelle, love and desire are intertwined with violence, pain and a desire to be dominated-Fassbinder\u2019s film version of Querelle brings out the artificial and surreal nature of the romantic relationships in \u2018Querelle\u2019 brilliantly. The world of Genet is not one for the light-heard, but for those who feel art is the path by which we are able to explore the infinite experiences and viewpoints which life has to offer us. Quiescent and querulous, the narrator\u2019s voice is constantly shifting and changing, echoing the violent, yet beautiful, world of Brest.\u201cIf ever Brest seems less austere, it is when is a feeble sun gilds the waterfront, where the facades are as noble and grand as those in Venice; or again, when its narrow streets are thronged with a tumult of carefree matelots; or finally, under fog and rain.\u201d"}, {"userName": "regina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43492-regina", "userReview": "It's been about 2 decades since I read Querelle, but the scenes and poetic style marked me like a tattooed sailor.Warning: the scenes are sexually and violently graphic. Yet, when the murderous main character describes how he felt when he killed... Well, it's mind-boggling that Genet could describe it so sensitively and beautifully. If you loved the Todd Haynes' film, Poison, and if you enjoy exploring the minds of the damaged and desperate, Querelle is the book for you. It is a master's work and probably deserves 5 stars; I'll re-visit and update. (BTW, Fassbinder made this into a film , but its tone is nothing like the book.

Genet's book originally appeared in French in the 40's and Steward was simply too far ahead of his time in thinking that the subject matter would be accepted in the US. Steward, and several of his literary companions, shared a reverence for Genet and Querelle in particular\u2026.one going so far as to travel to Brest to hunt down every nook and cranny mentioned in the book that was still standing and accessible. Needless to say, I couldn\u2019t wait to finish Steward's bio and get my hands on a copy of it. That anticipation and the build up to it is, in large part, responsible for my reaction to the book and this review. In no uncertain terms I can say that the writing is beautiful, almost hypnotically poetic. Add to that a delicious cast of characters- murderers, thieves, whores, sex addicts, liars, convicts and voyeurs. Add also an appropriately dangerous setting- the sinister underbelly of a seedy, French, port town with all its hiding places, abandoned prisons, whore houses, dark alleys, bleak ramparts and deserted dockyards. Yes! The perfect storm I thought as I dove in and began turning pages. (I could just see Jean Paul Belmondo with the collar of his pea coat turned up, lurking in the shadows.) Unfortunately, as I went along, I became increasingly aware that I was grasping for something in the book that wasn\u2019t altogether there. I couldn't get a hold of a through line that compelled me to keep going, yet I did. Was it because of Genet's tendency to ramble off on philosophical tangents that constantly interrupted the story line? Was it the result of a poor translation? My over-eagerness to 'get into it'? Whatever it was, I was left with an ambivalence, a disappointment that there wasn\u2019t more to wrest from the experience. Finally, as with many things in life, I\u2019m sorry to say that my disappointment in it was almost as great as my anticipation of it, and will quote the same sentence that another reviewer, below, quoted from page 255: \u201cThis book goes on for too many pages, and it bores us.\u201d....probably not unlike this interminable review, you're thinking."}, {"userName": "d", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7935992-d", "userReview": "Esta es la obra de un santo, una Anunciaci\u00f3n dionis\u00edaca.

I went to bed super early on New Year's Eve. It wasn't even seven p.m. yet. My big plans for the night was watching my dvd of Fassbinder's Querelle. I fell asleep some point. I felt overwhelmingly tired. Maybe waking up at 3 a.m. had something to do it. I still feel tired (same reason. Instead of early birds getting worms I just feel wormy). More than anything, my brain is pushing through extra brain fogginess. I apologize in advance if this doesn't make any sense (that's not like when someone prefaces something offensive with a \"Now don't get offended\" as if it is license to say whatever they like. It's more like me kicking myself ahead of time when I don't make any sense. If that makes sense). I have a lot of thoughts on this but in the most disjointed train of thought way. I'm relieved that no one can read my mind. (Maybe it would be better if someone could.)The previous owner of my copy of Querelle must have been writing a paper for some class. There are notes in the margins and underlined meaningful passages. Or maybe Christian Slater was plotting a suicide note for a mythologically prevalent person named Heather.I'm developing a weird sort of mind relationship with Jean Genet. It's not reading but more like a push-probe. I relate to living in the empty fireplaces of dreams not dreamed. Fire poker? I four starred both I've read because they haven't yet achieved the \"goosebumps\" status in my frame of references in the Mariel train of thoughts that I think about all day. I'm resistant to giving in to this is who I really am.(I'm sure I look absolutely crazy to anyone who catches me having these conversations in my head.) I take in the psychotic humanly observations and will use them in my frame of reference for things that I think about a lot and pretend I don't want to run back into his cell when I'm afraid I'll never fit into the belonging world. I am starting to use Genet a lot these days. It's not getting better. All I want to do is read.Okay, I didn't like what I've seen of the movie so far because the viewer relationship is changed. The book feels like that jazzed up feeling I get only from watching someone very charismatic. The Morrissey feeling of my space but it has a mirror for you. That's what I really want to say, to me, to explain it. Querelle's build-up within himself I felt like that feeling when you imagine you are living in your own movie. Your favorite songs are \"the soundtrack to your life\". It could have a soundtrack. See their gesture and they could know how you feel when your legs pulse, catch what your eyes alight. It's a one-sided mutual attraction because it hums off of them from inside of you.The thing that makes other people seem less real. I can't say exactly what that is because I haven't figured it out yet. If there's no reflection they seem less real to me than the one far away that I cannot touch. I know it's a Jean Genet thing. The voice in a tin can with strings, or a seashell, dead sea salt authors and prophets... It's probably all some visual trick I forgot the science to explain. You know how the sky isn't really blue? I know it is acting. I know they are stories. I know I make it all up. I believe it more. Young, in all cases, in the movies. Voices that say never say die. I haven't really thought about the age thing that much. I think it's that time when the mental fires haven't been used up. Or the energy. I don't feel in my heart that it is \"What have you done for me lately?\" But there is something about a young David Bowie that the older David Bowie doesn't have. Ambition for output for others? Maybe? I'll have to add this to my mental discussions with myself. It's probably a looking back at others. That would be the worst- to only look at yourself.Mariel, you know there was more to it than that.Querelle was okay looking. In that good body frat boy way of someone you wouldn't really look twice at. This is what the movie is like:Generic fetishism. Stuff that you hear other people are into that doesn't really mean anything. Leather, or nurse outfits, or horny catholic schoolgirls, firemen. It's just the faceless (I'm stealing this line from Lanark) \"gaggle of sexuality\". That was pretty much why Seblond's desire for the tight bodies of young muscle boys didn't go that far with me. His desire is like the horny old man you see in libraries who is watching a group of boring teen girls together. Separate them from each other and they are the average girl. He probably wouldn't be that into them. But now he can't stop staring at the legs in the short skirts. I don't really care about that.I thought for sure the movie would have it in spades. It's watching, after all. Okay, some of it was because the actors looked like \"Okay, if you say they are hot, girls\" love interests on The Golden Girls ick to me. Genet's writing manages to not be telling like it is, despite the many times a sentence is shadowed with a \"This is how it is gonna be\". It wouldn't be right if the dream will worked out that way.The shadowy to them friendships and invisible connecting threads between the men. Something I am unsure of in either of Genet's books I've read is the feminine role that allows two men to be together. (I have always wondered about why there are butch lesbians and effeminate men. If you were attracted to men wouldn't they be the most manliest of men?) I probably don't want to think of it in those terms, as if women are the subordinate ones. It's like how sometimes personality types depress the shit out of me. I don't want to know about the sameness of everybody. .. I am not interested in man and woman differences so much as unique differences. Yeah, so the shadowy connections between the men. I do wonder about that male camaraderiethat I see happen. Men who get buoyed up by being around each other. Sometimes I can actually see a guy feel like more of a man because of another more manly man talking to him. Somehow this translates to me as different than the IT thing Morrissey has and more a lonely shadowy friendship among others that I have no idea how to tap into (if I wanted to). I've seen women feel attractive as if they imagine themselves to look like a pretty woman standing next to them. This is not the same thing as the story. To do this Genet dream right you are not in it at all. It's like having a dream about an animal running. You're the horse but you're not you.I have a great capacity to feel lonely. I was really interested in the lines in Querelle's loneliness. He felt separated from the rest of the world after his murders, rather than separated from himself, because he had accepted what he'd done and felt changed. I felt the deliberate sever but not the line from before. I think you'd have to be able to see gaggles of sexuality, or maybe a whole stampede.Something I'm very interested in is what I've seen like collectively decided as \"losing\" is unrequited love. Our Lady of the Flowers rejoiced in that feeling, the beauty of living in your own created beauty in another person. Okay, I don't know if anyone who is reading this has ever seen Vincent Gallo's Buffalo '66 (one of my favorite films). It has one of my favorite descriptions ever on unrequited love. Billy only needs that something good to think about to make everything else stop. It's sustaining itself, real or not doesn't matter. (The girl he liked is utter shit.) I love that making stuff up and the ideas becoming a part of something real inside of you. There's a different side shown in Querelle. Everybody is losing. It's the ego of youth. The status of who has the upper hand happens over and over. The upper hand because of who is better looking, or who cares more. Love making you weak. The jealousy and wanting to be the other person. I could relate to Querelle's own planet of loneliness, if not the murders. I don't want the faceless tight young bodies of lust loneliness. I don't ever want a stampede. Christian Slater wrote notes in the margins about Seblond's taking Christianity at its word. His humility and divinity. I wouldn't have seen it that way as Christianity isn't in my thoughts. He wants to give himself up to that beauty that he wants. He is wont to cry for his joy of it. Maybe I just don't get possession in that sense.Querelle wants to take into his own everything that he steals, things and life. He has to make his mark and forge a bond lest they take over him and haunt. I can get those forms of self imposed detachment. It's a way of putting oneself at ease that nothing can hurt you. I feel like Querelle, with his \"star\" that he talks to, and his own \"planet\" of himself, is possible to him because he imposes onto what he comes into contact with. I felt that the murders were like sexual desires that exist as an overwhelming urge to take over, to penetrate. Until it is over and then he's not horny any longer (so to speak). The murders were confidence to him like his own appearance was his personal build-up in his mind as his own power. Querelle lives his whole life as his own movie stage in his own mind. One without any eyes. (I realize I use this description a lot in my reviews since, and probably before. I can't help it. I'm conflicted about how much I NEED stories.)I had written something about Gil feeling his murder victim, Theo, was more alive to him than to dead. There was more to it than that (Theo hated what he couldn't have. Gil hated him for wanting to own him). I think I was struck by all of the threads of everyone wanting to take hold of everybody else. Theo finally got Gil in by being murdered by him. He'd never go away.Oh! There was twin stuff too. It's so stupid that the film casted actors as identical brothers Robert and Querelle who look absolutely nothing alike. Robert is the pet lover of brothel Madame Lysiane. Theirs is one of those relationships that changes and grows sinister based on the imperceptible tides of who needs who the most. Lysiane grows jealous when she can't get over how much alike the two brothers are. They hate and love each other. I'm an identical twin myself so it was both ludicrous and fascinating to me this idea that they were the same person because they looked exactly alike. I have been the one to be railed at in jealous speeches about loving my twin more. Damn straight I do. I could have told her that she'd have gotten absolutely nowhere with that. I was repulsed when she \"gives herself up\" as his natural slave (I think it was something like an essential cave mentality) in order to fit between the two of them (which she does not do. it's not like that! It's like asking someone to love their child less than they love you, or their parent). Anyway, I was fascinated with their closeness. It's the urge to separate yourself from your family when you are growing up. Yet, nothing else will be able to touch on it or replace it. Your own life, shared life, the part of you no one will ever touch.This is a long review and I didn't mention any of Christian Slater's thoughts about sailors as natural criminals and murders. I guess I don't think of anyone as having a natural place in life. It's fucking hard. I get that these men all insist that they are not gay (despite having a whole lotta gay sex). They feel like women and men. They try and exert in some sick and cruel ways and then make up fictions to get by. It's watching over your back in paranoia and making up loves. I get feeling like a man and like a woman and then it's the placement that confuses me. It's taken me a long time to say why Jean Genet tears me so. It's that he forced himself to live in the hole, slower than the speed of light and the only brightness he could have by inventing. He would kill them before they could have an unhappy ending. I don't know how not to be like that either. There's something like loving in it because it's always travelling. It's pretty damned miserable. Time has to go by better. Placement has gotta be wrong. I still don't know how to keep getting the romantic part in the mirrors but I do know that Genet could do it in the first look. Is it losing to die over and over in doing it? Somehow he starts to feel less like a phoenix rising and it's too lonely. When does it ever stop?(Funny how in my memory there's so much passion in him but really he's the burning fire inside a bullet proof tummy I always said he was. Fuck, me too.)"}, {"userName": "Stephen Brody", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30032014-stephen-brody", "userReview": "Jean Genet, the baddest bad boy of French literature and raker-in-the-mud of crime and depravity, can to a less queasy generation be somewhat tediously repetitive and clich\u00e9-ridden when he\u2019s over-industriously churning his own obsessions into \u2018poetry\u2019- yet another hoodlum with rose-petals fluttering around him. Notre Dame des Fleurs, trying to outdo Baudelaire and Rimbaud, is without doubt brilliantly original and powerful but as literature really a bit of a mess. Querelle de Brest, some time later, is better because the writer like any artist who warrants the name stands aside from himself and views his \u2018scene\u2019, even if it\u2019s himself, from a more impersonal perspective - and for the first time, perhaps not incidentally, employs something like a \u2018story\u2019. Querelle is a stupid thug, a thief, a treacherous murderer and a cringing coward, attributes which are music to his creator\u2019s ears when he has careless blond curls, flashing white teeth, a pronounced musculature and other real or imagined anatomical details we needn\u2019t go into here \u2013 the very epitome according to the author\u2019s unorthodox standards of desirable because unattainable \u2018masculinity\u2019. He\u2019s already distanced somewhat by being interpreted through the love-struck eyes of his superior officer on the boat where he\u2019s sometimes employed as an ordinary sailor, and though the timidly infatuated officer is transparently Genet himself it\u2019s an improvement on the totally self-centred delinquent youth in Miracle of the Rose. Because Genet has used his considerable intelligence to \u2018grow up\u2019 from a confused and troubled past, as here for example: \u201cThere exists, somewhere deep within us, a secret room with an armour-plated door. It contains, along with several poor caged dogs, other monsters of which the most alarming is the one to be found in the very middle of the room. This is the living reproach at the centre of our innermost being. Enclosed within a huge glass case, corresponding almost to the shape of its body, this creature is mauve in colour and soft, almost gelatinous in substance. It would resemble a great fish, were it not for the very human sadness of its head. The keeper who watches over these monsters harbours the greatest contempt for this one, which, we know well, would find a degree of peace and comfort in the embrace of another of its kind. But it has no like. The other monsters differ from it in a few minor details. It is lonely, unique, and yet it loves us. In hopeless doggy devotion it waits for a friendly look from us, one we shall never accord it. Querelle lived his whole life in the company of this disconsolate creature.\u201dThat\u2019s a pretty masterly if exceptionally grim exposition of \u2018love\u2019. No ordinary person would otherwise find Querelle other than revolting and despicable. This is not an invitation for the rest of us to love him, far less to forgive or even \u2018understand\u2019, but it\u2019s a strong persuasion to understand ourselves, or the terrible plight of the individual human spirit and therefore to see a little more clearly why Genet in some esoteric quarters became elevated to sainthood and \u2013 almost \u2013 to join the ranking of Dostoyevsky. There are other episodes which in other contexts, even now when graphicness has become as much an illusion as anything else, would be grossly pornographic \u2013 Madame Lysiane\u2019s unsatisfying attempt at love-making with Querelle\u2019s equally loutish brother, Querelle\u2019s \u2018seduction\u2019 or conquest by a policeman \u2013 but here describe private intimacies never elsewhere achieved with such shocking truthfulness, making do with second best or just anything at all rather than nothing, and so raise the participants to a level of pathetic or banal humanity which they would never reach if they were \u2018real\u2019."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3425721-mike", "userReview": "What can one say of Genet? He was one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, without a doubt, and possibly the greatest writer working in the French language since Gide to address issues of male sexuality in an unconventional, discursive, manner. However, a lot of his fiction to me is rather depressing\u2014droll even in places\u2014and this book was no different, though it did offer more realism and tangible detail than some of his other works. The port city of Brest is one of the more-gritty cities of France, a place always associated mainly with two things: military might (as a naval base) and crime. Genet well understands this and paints the city as the central character of the novel. With the city taking the lead, everyone else brings up the proverbial rear: sailors, naval officers, madames, et cetera. Petty crime and crime grand, it's all here. I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in Genet or 20th century French literature, but I will admit it left me wanting in places. To write a literary whodunit or fiction that desires for nothing more than to be true crime, I would look to Hawksmoor, the 1985 novel by the British writer Peter Ackroyd. While we may not want Genet to be P.D. James, at times the crime aspects could have been played for more interest than they were. Or, perhaps it's just my own personal taste: I will say it's a powerful work and lacks none of all that makes Genet great, I just couldn't get into it as I've always desired to get into Genet's work.If you can read French, do read it in the French. Also, I expect if I read it over again, it will grow on me. There's a lot that's wonderful about this book but it's also trucated to me in places, and almost seems rushed sometimes.

It's one of those books that manages to be tastefully tasteless, despite there being no moral compass or structure. There is a remarkable amount of sensitivity, despite the intensive and pre-ordained destitution. Like CRASH, it's a novel about being human. Unlike CRASH, however, the damaged characters in QUERELLE live in a very real, hateful world while the characters in CRASH found a way continue to escape from reality and achieve a level of sexual intensity that overcame all the pain, guilt, and self-hatred that they were all feeling, even when their obsessions began to take priority over their personal lives. With CRASH, you explored the world of characters who have fashioned their own kingdom based collectively on their, some might call, destructive kink. With QUERELLE, the characters are given no such luxury. To me, this is a much more difficult world to explore because nobody even really knows what to call it or what it even is. Cruelty and deliberation begin to mold together and the reader is left with their head being completely backward. It's a brilliant piece of writing and it certainly left a huge impression on me. To me, this world is more real to me than most worlds that get explored in the typical LGBTQ novels. Read it, even if you aren't gay. You'll be mesmerized by it's beauty.

Even Genet himself seems to admit that the 'book has gone on too long' near the end, and when the last page is finally reached, the payoff doesn't feel grand.Nonetheless, those moments that do shine, shone as brightly as Querelle's smile in which we all lose ourselves and assume \"the attitude by which we comprehend what love is: consciousness of the division of what previously was one, of what is to be thus divided, while you yourself are watching yourself.\""}, {"userName": "Cameron", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15191353-cameron", "userReview": "I was led to Querelle via Flowers and Thief's Journal.

After 33 yrs or so of reading Genet.. I reckon he just doesn't do it for me anymore. The things that I probably found energizing when I 1st started reading his bks, the criminal philosophizing, is mostly tedious to me now. &.. the cocks.. oh am I sick of the cocks.. Do we really exist in a society where people can think of little else other than cock size? How boring. Big cocks & little minds. I saw the Fassbinder film based on this bk when it came out, around 1982. Id' already seen other Fassbinder films. I was interested in him as a major German filmmaker. I didn't like his \"Querelle\" at all. I remember it as being highly stylized in a theatrical way that was a total turn-off for my more experimental tastes. In fact, truth be told, I've never liked Fassbinder much ANYWAY. Too depressing - even his comedies are just grim reminders of how base & repulsive most people are to me. At 1st, when I started reading \"Querelle of Brest\", I was reminded, once again, of what a WRITER Genet is, of how carefully he puts his words together, of how 'poetically' (as so many others wd have it) he tells his tale of this murderous sailor. Above all, over & above being gay, over & above being a criminal, Genet was a WRITER. It struck me that I've never run across Genet being referred to as a \"crime fiction writer\". He's too 'flowery', too philosophical. But, in a sense, he cd be compared to Patricia Highsmith. Querelle cd be compared to her character Mr. Ripley. Both Genet & Highsmith give more psychology than most. When I started reading \"Querelle..\" I thought I was finishing reading the last of Genet, the one last bk of his I hadn't read - getting closure. Then I saw that he has a play I haven't read: \"Splendid's\". GROAN. I'm somewhat of an obssessive-compulsive, a completist. After reading \"Querelle\" will I actually read another bk by Genet? Not anytime soon.. In the end I'd say \"Querelle..\" was 'interesting', well-written.. but I probably didn't really like it. I found it so tedious so quickly that I kept putting off reading it but, OC that I am, I forced myself to read the whole thing. But, as w/ my reactions to Fassbinder's films, I just found myself sickened by the characters & not really that impressed by Genet's religious hard-on for this form of male 'culture'. I'm the enemy of the mindless mental traps that these characters wallow in. After I finished the bk, I watched the Fassbinder film again to cap off the experience. I think I hated it even more this time than I did when I 1st saw it. As I recall, \"Querelle\" was Fassbinder's last film. It was different from the earlier ones - more theatrical, less 'realistic': theatrical lighting, melodramatic music, narration, intertitles, obvious sets instead of locations, 'unrealistic' intellectual monologues in the mouths of assholes - that sort of thing. &, yet, I understood in 1982, & I still understand now, Fassbinder's treatment: it's (mostly) faithful to the bk, it's faithful to what sets Genet apart from most writers who might approach his subjects. Still, I hated it. It was so tedious, I kept being tempted to fast-forward thru it. I stopped it halfway thru & took a short nap. It was practically unbearable.. but I knew I'd be writing this & wanted the film fresh in my mind. Fassbinder did change a few parts. He has Querelle dress Gil as Querrelle's brother Robert when he sends him out to rob Lieutenant Seblon. That was an interesting touch, it tied the plot even tighter. I wonder what Genet thought about that? He was still alive when the film came out."}, {"userName": "Leonard Klossner", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5946697-leonard-klossner", "userReview": "The characters in Genet's Querelle, like the thieving prostituting criminal who wrote it, are almost all thieves and/or murderers (some dearly wish to become one), pimps or prostitutes. They are all deceptively young--one would think that, having read of the circumstances of their unlawful exploits, that they were much older than teenagers--and just about every one, including the police and a Navy lieutenant, are homosexual. \tGenet's treatment of the bawdy young criminals leave us unable to condemn them. They are all beautiful, handsome. They are all angels, or saints. Their thefts and murders do not fulfill their beauty, they are necessitated by their beauty. In Genet's world, the beautiful are the unlawful, society's dejected, and the ruthlessly violent. And God are they all handsome. Like Mishima, Genet finds beauty in death and destruction. Just like Mishima's Mizoguchi is moved by his perverted conception of beauty to burn the temple of the golden pavilion, so too is Genet's Querelle coerced by his newfound love and affection for a teenager who, in a drunken rage, commits a senseless murder, to betray him. Querelle, a roughneck sailor, dreamed of meeting a man whose secret murders and thefts would endear the two newly acquainted criminals. He senses a potential for endearment to this teenager, Gil, who, following his senseless murder, has also been placed under suspicion for one of Querelle's murders that preceded it, sought refuge in an old abandoned prison where he spends the latter part of the book. The two share an intimate moment, their tongues caress one another's, and their lips indulge in those of their partners'. Despite the flowering of their intimacy, Querelle, after being sucked off in secret by the policeman, Mario, betrays the whereabouts of his friend. \tNear the end of the story, Querelle's vessel is soon to take off from the city of Brest in which the entire narrative takes place. His brother, the madame of the brothel (whose relationship with Querelle's brother is compromised by an act of infidelity with Querelle), and all those the sailor became intimate with, are soon to be abandoned by Querelle who, through the power of the narrative's focus on the powerful sailor, and the youthful ardor which commands to develop a fondness for the roughhewn young kid in those he encounters, imbues them with purpose. With Querelle soon to leave, the other characters are slowly removed from their prior sphere of relevance. It is the magnificence of Querelle, despite (or perhaps because of) his murders and his crimes and his taste for young boys, that radiates an unconquerable sense of beauty onto all that he comes into contact with."}, {"userName": "Halvor (Raknes)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49780289-halvor-raknes", "userReview": "There is deep penetration in this book. 'Bareback' doesn't even begin to mimic the raw realism of Genet's exploration of explosive intimate encounters between virtual archetypes of masculinity (and centrally, one female as well \u2013 the 'Madam'). These encounters, however, are simply perfunctory part of the ontological stream of Genet's profound meanderings in the doings, motives and psychological stirrings of the protagonist as well as those of several other characters with whom we are becoming intimately familiar.As my first acquaintance with Jean Genet's art, my anticipations were in no way let down. Yes, 'tour de force' it is. Here is a sublime creative power which could readily discuss acute observations on the nature of genius, if that had been within the ontic realm of the story. But that's not present in this novel, not as such. Still, we are convinced that the true nature of such a phenomenon is sure to be found on the same profound level of psychological being at which the intertwined stories in this book unfold.Gregory Streatham is the translator, and as a non-native English speaker, I had a tough time keeping up with the opulent pervasiveness of rare English vocabulary. Without my several dictionaries, including a slang dictionary, I would not have stood a chance getting through this novel. To elaborate, I'm a fifty year old Norwegian man, I've lived for two years in the United States, and I have expressed myself in English extensively. Still, had it not been for the sheer power of this literary oevre with its absolutely unfettered eroticism combining as a glue for the narrative, I would hardly have stayed with this book. In fact, I wonder if the original French is equally abstruse in this respect, or maybe the translator in this manner has added a layer of inaccessibility to prevent the book being read as pornography by less mature readers.This novel will reveal to almost anyone poignant facets of the masculine being in one of his most explosive and almost archetypal expressions, which will, if apprehended, be novel and elucidating, even to the extent of conveying an expanded understanding of one's very own human being, right down to their soul."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11970409-tim", "userReview": "Mixed reactions to this book. I like Genet's writing. He's poetic. The writing is like sifting sand, swirling to form new mosaics. It shifts, revealing something just below the sand's surface and then shifts again. The landscape is constantly altered. I liked that. It kept the reading interesting although the writing felt weaker towards the end. I would open another Genet book.I gave this one two stars, however, because I simply didn't like the story. The characters were emotionally underdeveloped. Querelle, Sebon, Gil...all of them. It's not that they were childlike, it's as if their development went athwart. Their development was queered somewhere along the way. The fact that all of them were homosexual, or in Gil's case treated as such, seemed to be at the core of this underdevelopment. Perhaps these characters are representative of the tension in repression and expression of same sex desire in the mid 20th century. At some level, Genet probably brilliantly revealed the interior world of a gay man of the time. Sebon's constant daydreaming, never acting, for instance. Yet it's this persistent daydreaming that makes him appear stunted and ineffectual. Another example is Querelle's understanding of himself as a criminal - which his is, through and through - an identity he embraces in almost a spiritual way.The characters are reflective. Genet shows the reader that they do think about their lives. And yet, each of the characters is seen by one another as flat. The cop, the brothel owner, the sailor, the officer. To one another they are caricatures. They are the outward role they play to society only. All connections between characters in this book are commerce. They are negotiated transactions. There is no intellectual or emotional curiousity about the other person. Maybe this, too, is part of Genet's brilliance but for me, the effect was a two star story."}], "description": "\u039f \u0396\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad \u03ad\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c8\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2
