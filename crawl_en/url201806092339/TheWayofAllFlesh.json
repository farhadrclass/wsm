The book is being released in the UK on 30 August. It was super! Firstly because it\u2019s a historical AND medical murder-mystery story, two subjects I am interested in. I\u2019ve not read much crime but I don\u2019t know why now because the storyline in this was quite riveting, tense, and surprising. But along with it being a historical crime novel, Ambrose Parry also tells the remarkable story of the discovery of chloroform and the research done by medical practitioners of old - including some fairly gruesome procedures tossed in, not gratuitously but to highlight the reality of healthcare in \u2018the old days\u2019 (shudder). And I loved the protagonists, Sarah the housemaid-who-should-be-studying-medicine and Raven-young-doctor-with-secrets-finding-his-feet. The book is written in an old-fashioned style with some wonderful words you don\u2019t see used, but it worked to immerse me more deeply into the era of the story and it wasn\u2019t more difficult to read for it.One especially good theme throughout the book is that of misogyny and class in the 19th century which helps you really grasp what little opportunity there was for those born of the \u2018inferior sex\u2019 or on the wrong side of town.Anyway, I\u2019ve pre-ordered the \u2018proper\u2019 book and will definitely read it again. And apparently there are more stories in the offing so hooray!"}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6894211-connie", "userReview": "When a couple of young women are found dead in similar suspicious circumstances, medical student Will Raven - apprenticed to Dr Simpson and Simpson's housemaid Sarah investigate which leads them into some grave trouble.This is a fast-paced gritty historical fiction set in 1840's Edinburgh, when Edinburgh led the world in the field of medicine.This is a story of the birth of anaesthesia, of power and corruption.I loved this and I'm glad there will be more. 5*"}, {"userName": "Latkins", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27603384-latkins", "userReview": "This book - written under a pseudonym by Chris Brookmyre and his scientist wife Marisa Haetzman - is a real treat. Set in 19th century Edinburgh, it's a murder mystery as the young doctor Will Raven embarks on a new career in the New Town working for the eminent Dr Simpson (a real, pioneering figure of the time). Raven has problems, though - he's indebted to a money-lender who has sent round his thugs to intimidate him. He also recently found the body of a young woman, a prostitute who he likes to think became his friend, and he suspects that there's a doctor who is up to no good in the city. Along with Raven's story, there is that of Sarah, a housemaid at Dr Simpson's who has ambitions to work in medicine herself, despite there not being any opportunities for her to so, due to her gender and social status. This is a really enjoyable story which successfully blends a historical tale with a gripping mystery and even a little romance. It's the first in a new series, so I'm already looking forward to the sequel!"}, {"userName": "Char Jones", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69638075-char-jones", "userReview": "THE WAY OF ALL FLESH is one scary read told at lightening pace in atmospheric 1847 Edinburgh. Young women are found horrifically murdered throughout the city. Medical student Will Raven and housemaid Sarah Fisher reluctantly team up to discover why. A fine read for day or night but be sure to keep the lights on! 5 starsGrateful to NetGalley and Canongate Books US for the early read.

Many nights are spent with some of the city's top surgeons sitting round the dinner table in the post-prandial slumber sampling various substances looking to find the perfect anaesthetic.Will Raven, a recently qualified doctor, starts a new job as apprentice to Edinburgh's pre-eminent midwifery expert, Dr James Young Simpson. But he has recently found the dead body of a female friend and starts to investigate the mysterious circumstances of her demise.The book takes several strands: we have the true history of Edinburgh's medical revolution where doctors like Simpson vied to get the job done but also find better ways to do it for their patients, we have the murder mystery angle, we have the capable and frustrated women who are refused to even attempt to do jobs they are clearly able to do, and we have the class system in full evidence and while many go along with it, some people like Simpson try to get past this and make their households more inclusive for all.The threads are all interwoven brilliantly and combine to give a story that is both thrilling and interesting.Having read a lot of Chris Brookmyre, I had high expectations for his storytelling and these were more than met with a brilliantly paced and enjoyable page-turner. I believe writing with his wife has helped tone down the language a little and the tone of the dialogue is very different to his previous work.My one gripe would be that the climax of the story was a little laboured, with every single event, decision and twist explained numerous times from different perspectives. Given I had spotted a number of hints quite early on and knew who the perpetrator was, and was happy to assume certain things had happened, I didn't feel the need to have this confirmed at length in great detail.Otherwise an excellent book and the start of a new series that I will be avidly waiting for the next instalment of."}, {"userName": "Emi Bevacqua", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua", "userReview": "Having just enjoyed a vacation in Edinburgh, I was thrilled to come across this medical mystery set in 1840's Scotland, already set to become a televised series with the rights snapped up by Benedict Cumberbatch! There are several mysteries presented in The Way of All Flesh: a series of tortuously constricted corpses, main character Will Raven's shady origins, and how in the world women back then (like heroine Sarah Fisher) kept from going insane given their limited rights and resources. Ambrose Parry's writing is first-rate, which makes sense since it's the pen name for best-selling author Christopher Brookmyre and his anesthesiologist wife Dr. Marisa Haetzman; ergo the cheekily recurring reference to Currer Bell's Jane Eyre. Colorful Scots language-derived bon mots like \"sphincter-blossom\" abound and titillate, and descriptions of Edinburgh with its closes, the Forth, the Scott Monument, and \"public decorum and private sin, city of a thousand secret selves. Aye.\" I received this ARC from NetGalley and will definitely look for more reads from Canongate in future."}, {"userName": "Thebooktrail", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25264586-thebooktrail", "userReview": "Ooh this is the kind of novel that makes historical fans very excited. It's a bit like a scratch and sniff novel with all the smells and sounds of Edinburgh back in the 1840s. Hold your nose maybe when reading, but keep those eyes open as it's full of gothic delights!full review later of course but I got so excited I had to write this now."}, {"userName": "Douglas Osler", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56348302-douglas-osler", "userReview": "This is meant to be the first in a series of crime novels and I cannot wait for the next one! Set in nineteenth century Edinburgh,its context is convincing and cleverly reinvents the atmosphere of the time. The surround of Simpson discovering chloroform makes it educationally interesting and that factual history merges well with the invented crime story concerning the murder of young women around the city. They lie well together. This has been well researched but is also well written. Come on the next one!"}, {"userName": "Gram", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20951788-gram", "userReview": "In Edinburgh in 1847, medical student Will Raven is given the post of apprentice to Dr Simpson, a highly respected physician and an expert in anaesthesia. Raven is also given a room in the Simpson home and there he encounters Sarah, a maidservant who has a fascination for medical matters and secretly reads books on the subject, borrowed from Dr Simpson's library. A strong willed young woman, Sarah has hopes of one day working in the medical profession - an outrageous idea for a woman at that time in history. Just before he joins the Simpson household, Evie - a prostitute who's become a friend of Raven - is found dead, her face and body hideously contorted and similar deaths in the poorest parts of Edinburgh have him believing these women may have been murdered.As Dr Simpson treats patients from the richest to the poorest in Scotland's capital city, he and his colleagues carry out daring experiments. The book's language and descriptive settings seem to bring mid-19th Century Edinburgh to life. However, it has to be said that readers may find the details of Simpson and Raven's medical procedures rather unsettling - particularly those which involve difficult births - although I felt these only add to the story's ring of authenticity.Meanwhile, Raven and Sarah carry out an investigation into the young girls' deaths and the couple, initially disliking each other, gradually share a mutual respect and the beginnings of a romantic involvement.The action moves quickly along with the occasional pause for some of the characters to give vent to their views on various medical matters, particularly the use of anaesthetics, some of which are denounced by Scotland's more unenlightened religious leaders.Ambrose Parry is a pseudonym for a collaboration between award-winning author Chris Brookmyre and his wife Marisa Haetzmana, herself a consultant anaesthetist. It was Marisa's research for her Master's degree in the History of Medicine which uncovered the material upon which this novel is based.This is a remarkable story mixing medical drama with romance and murder mystery. I hope it's the first in a series about Raven and Sarah.My thanks go to the publisher Canongate Books and Netgalley for the chance to read this book in exchange for an unbiased review."}], "description": "A vivid and gripping historical crime novel set in 19th century Edinburgh, from husband-and-wife writing team Chris Brookmyre and Marisa HaetzmanEdinburgh, 1847.
