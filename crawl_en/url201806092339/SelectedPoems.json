And I love the way in which Frost writes poetry. The success of the poems resides in their ability to speak to the reader; they have a certain sense of universal quality as they evoke profound mental states. He does this through using objects, often natural ones, to describe a certain human emotion or feeling. A tree in the wind embodies indecision and the inability to move on. A road split in two represents a part of the human experience that I can now only think of in the terms Frost put them in. I am, of course, referring to one of his most famous poems:\"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth;Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014I took the one less travelled by,And that has made all the difference.\u201dI remember the first time I read those lines, I was wrought with regret: regret for a decision I had not yet made. And that bespeaks the power of these words. They are beyond time and place; they demonstrate the interconnectedness of all things: they strike directly at conformity. Memory and regret can be triggered by such a simple image, one that Frost has captured all so perfectly. Although a modernist writer, Frost did not abandon all poetical tradition like his peers. His writing is a hybrid of new and old. The language is simple and direct, though it also carries with it the weight of the past. At times he writes in blank verse and at other times he experiments with form and style. For me this speaks of a certain sense of integrity; he was not quite ready to turn his back on generation, after generation, of poetical tradition: he used it to inform and improve his modern work. It also means that his poetry does not all feel the same; some poems are vastly different to each other. This meant that the collection stayed rather fresh even towards the end. I read this book over a number of years. I first picked it up back in 2015 and I think my appreciation of Frost has only grown since. Whilst he is not my favourite poet, I certainly count him amongst my top five. I just love the way he uses the natural world."}, {"userName": "Fareya", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22583912-fareya", "userReview": "It is not without excellent reason that Robert Frost is considered one of the greatest American poets of the century. What impresses me most about his poems is the usage of simple and colloquial words to portray ordinary, everyday incidents that have a deeper, denser meaning hidden within. Clear and conversational lines conceal subtle philosophies on life and complex social issues at their core. Also, I find myself completely drawn to the stunning picture he paints with his expressive poems on nature and those beautiful, beautiful illustrations of the New England seasons and scenery. \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\", \"The Road Not Taken\" and \"Fire and Ice\" are some of Frost's most read and loved poems. But along with these, and many more of course, one that really stands out as a personal favorite is \"Reluctance\" Out through the fields and the woods And over the walls I have wended;I have climbed the hills of view And looked at the world, and descended;I have come by the highway home, And lo, it is ended.The leaves are all dead on the ground, Save those that the oak is keepingTo ravel them one by one And let them go scraping and creepingOut over the crusted snow, When others are sleeping.And the dead leaves lie huddled and still, No longer blown hither and thither;The last lone aster is gone; The flowers of the witch hazel wither;The heart is still aching to seek, But the feet question \u2018Whither?\u2019Ah, when to the heart of man Was it ever less than a treasonTo go with the drift of things, To yield with a grace to reason,And bow and accept the end Of a love or a season?"}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "Since I was a little girl, Frost could do no wrong. He still can't. The cadence of his lines, the lucidity of his poetry, always transports me. I'm a little upset that my edition isn't listed here on GR though.

Frost seems to write poems made to be dissected in English classes. Oftentimes they are set up more as short stories, heavy on the dialogue, than poems. In fact, not that I'm a poetry expert, I could not detect what exactly made some of these poems verse rather than just spaced-out prose. I had a difficult time understanding a lot of these poems, but there were some that were really lovely. I'd be interested in rereading this collection in the future, but not picking up any more of Frost's poetry."}, {"userName": "Laura Verret", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2511187-laura-verret", "userReview": "we make ourselves a place apart / behind light words that tease and flout / but oh, the agitated heart / till someone find us really out // 'Revelation'"}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4314582-bethany", "userReview": "Ah, Robert Frost: the man who convinced me that I hated poetry. Years ago, I was assigned to read some of his poetry for school and, let's just say, I read them as if I was taking cough-syrup. (Note: Why, yes! I hate cough-syrup. I'll never forget the fateful night where I spit a mouthful of it across the bathroom. Good times...) Anyhow, so I didn't enjoy his poems because I was reading them with the wrong attitude &c. If Carl Sandburg hadn't come along later and shown me what a wonderful thing poetry can be, I don't know where I'd be today!So, while rummaging around the attic the other month, I came across this hated volume of poetry and decided to give ol' Robert another try. Guess what? I didn't hate him! He'll never be my favourite poet, but I don't hate him. (I didn't really care for the selections from North of Boston, but the other ones were good! The poem \"Birches\" was my favourite, I think.)"}, {"userName": "Maggie Roessler", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1816538-maggie-roessler", "userReview": "Drama: awesome.

Some of my Favorite works include, Home Burial, The Death of the Hired Man, The Line Gang, The Axe Helve, and The Black Cottage. I enjoyed these five works the most because it shows how people (in my opinion) think and talk to each other. I think that The Death of the Hired Man is probably my favorite because it goes to show you how some people are stuck in their ways and even when they are offered better, they take the route they know. The Line Gang takes a few reads to grasp. For me, if I don't reread it often, I forget what it means entirely and think of people that are ripping up the forests. I like this poem because it makes you think. The Axe Helve showed that even people that don't know each other that well can care immensely about the other one's safety. In The Axe Helve, the French neighbor that doesn't know the main character very well stops the main character from using his own axe because he (the french neighbor) is afraid for his safety. The French neighbor takes the main character to his house and gives him a better axe for free. The Black Cottage is a reflection of the past that is learned from conversation between two men. The two men talk about the Woman that used to live in the cottage. They talk about the fact that the Woman's children's art is still on the walls. They also say that the children were supposed to visit the house. Overall, I enjoyed this book of poetry. It has nice rhythm and some of the poems have a dark theme. -Jocelyn Kuntz"}, {"userName": "Branwen Sedai *of the White Ajah*", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701086-branwen-sedai-of-the-white-ajah", "userReview": "\"One of my wishes is that those dark trees,So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,Were not, as it were, the merest mask of gloom,But stretched away unto the edge of doom.I do not see why I should ever turn back,Or those should not set forth upon my trackTo overtake me, who should miss me hereAnd long to know if still I held them dear.They would not find me changed from him they knew-Only more sure of all I thought was true.\"I'll be honest, aside from two or three poems, I was previously not a huge fan of Robert Frost. My favorite poet happens to be D.H Lawrence, if anyone was wondering. :) Anywho, I saw this book at Barnes & Noble for super cheap and decided to pick it up. I'm actually glad I did, and even more glad that I read it. This was beautifully formatted, and an impressive selection of some of his best works. If you are a fan of Robert Frost or even just a lover of poetry in general, I would highly recommend this book as it is a beautiful rendition of his poems.

I still find that my favorite is \"Into My Own\". I always enjoy a discussion in which no doubt I will eventually say \"But the name of that poem is 'The Road Not Taken' and that takes the poem off in a totally different direction.\" I haven't read a lot of poetry, but have read much Ginsberg (\"Howl\" is a must for all readers, imho) and Merrill as of late. And so far, I haven't read any poetry collection as good as James Merrill's stunning \"A Scattering of Salts.\" (A five-star rating from me.)

Mending Wall because it tells how two neighbors build a wall and fix it in the springtime, and how they mend themselves well mending the wall. The Oven Bird because how the oven bird tells you when fall is coming. The poem that I liked the most is The Fear because it builds up suspense and then at the end of the poem it leaves you to imagine what happens. All the types of poems make you feel a certain way that changes the way you think about everyday work.

It gathers the first three of Robert Frost\u2019s books into one volume. \u201cA Boy\u2019s Will,\u201d \u201cNorth of Boston,\u201d and \u201cMountain Interval\u201d are all part of Frost\u2019s early work and they came out in a relatively short span: 1913, 1914, and 1916, respectively. However, one can see definite shifts in the nature of the poems across these collections. The poems of the first collection feature many shorter poems that are rhymed and metered. The middle poems are longer, are largely unrhymed and of varied meter / unmetered, and are often written as extended dialogs that convey a story or a bit of tension from one. The last collection features Frost\u2019s most famous poem, \u201cThe Road Not Taken,\u201d and contains many poems that are similar to that one in that they have more of the lyric quality of \u201cA Boy\u2019s Will\u201d but take the form of a short meditation. The theme that cuts across these poems is rural New England life. Apple-picking, wall mending, visiting someone in a snowy scene-- these are the kind of events that transpire in this work. Nature features in Frost\u2019s poems, but is largely secondary to the human element\u2014a setting not a subject.
