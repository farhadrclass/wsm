I don't need to read things that are uplifting. I am not set on having characters that are likable. But this collection was so dark, it left me feeling kind of horrible. This is a collection of stories that looked into the crawl space to find what was rotting there (figuratively, and in one story in this book, literally. I might suggest that if you read this collection, you should consider skipping the half-page after the flashlight is presented and the crawl space opened. I'm afraid it might give me nightmares).Concern with America's current wars runs through these stories, and I guess that might be what happened to Moore. Late in the book, there's a discussion about Abu Ghraib, and that's as horrifying as the thing found in the crawl space. And there's definitely an ongoing look at marriage, how men and women can fail each other and be cruel.It just seems that the dark and light are more balanced in her other works. This is bleak. I vowed to stop reading Joyce Carol Oates years ago, because while she's a magnificent writer, her books always left me feeling the way this one does, right on the edge between depressed and sickened. That said, the language of this book continually amazed me. \"The air was filled with the \"old-silver-jewelry smell of rain.\" And then pleasing wry humor like this: '\"Marriage is one long conversation,\" wrote Robert Louis Stevenson. Of course, he died when he was forty-four, so he had no idea how long the conversation could really get.'"}, {"userName": "LeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-leanne", "userReview": "Holy smokes, Lorrie Moore is brilliant and sharp and as cutting as broken glass! I do not like short stories, one bit, but darned if I didn't love these ones. In fact, I enjoyed the audio (narrated by Moore, herself) so much that I'm going to buy a hard copy to go back over and enjoy.This collection is about various characters in their middle age, with each having a date or spouse or significant other in the story with them. There is a sadness and disappointment in some of them, but not all, but there are so many goofy little plays on words, that I found myself smiling throughout. She writes scenes of despondency and hilarity with equal skill - bikers who are hired to break up a wedding end up going to the wrong nuptials, and a man leaves his woman friend after 8 years because he cannot handle her schizophrenic son, despite the boy viewing him as his only father.There is witty commentary about the placement of a billboard advertising hospice services next to a traffic sign:\u201cHOSPICE CARE: IT\u2019S NEVER TO SOON TO CALL read a billboard near the coffee shop in what constituted the neighborhood\u2019s commercial roar. Next to it a traffic sign read PASS WITH CARE. Surrealism could not be made up. It was the very electricity of the real.\u201d She describes somebody's wide, open laugh like this: \"She could see the creamy yellow of his teeth, his molars with their mercury eyes.\"I loved her novel, A Gate at the Stairs, and was impressed by Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?, but suddenly I'm a lover of short stories. Am off to go purchase anything I can get my hands on because her phrasing is something to go back and enjoy again. She brings in a good bit of political commentary, and while I am not a liberal and don't agree with her views, it was beautifully done. She does some of this with great flair - one character has a sinus infection and he is described as waterboarding himself in the bathroom with a Neti Pot. His partner knocks on the door and asks if he'll confess yet. This is also the only book I've ever read that compelled me to Google the term \"rat king.\" Oh. My. God.

From memory it went something like this...\"short stories are harder to write than a novel. You have to take the direct route, no side streets, no stopping to chat.\" And he is right.I am ambivalent about these stories, a few seemed to me to have little or no point to them. Others I enjoyed immensely.Broadly these stories are about human relationships and idiosyncrasies. How the things we love in a person can, over time, become irritating (as in familiarity breeds contempt); how we can think we are in accord with another person, but are actually at opposite ends of the spectrum; about the things we will do to \"fit in\" or to try and revive a relationship in it's death throes. Lorrie Moore is not afraid to bring to light our little insecurities and absurdities.I can't say this is my favourite collection of short stories, but there were a couple that I listened to twice. And I will probably go back and listen to this collection again at some point, and maybe then will adjust my review rating."}, {"userName": "Paquita Maria Sanchez", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez", "userReview": "I think I'm hopelessly in love with Lorrie Moore."}, {"userName": "Glenn Sumi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi", "userReview": "Lorrie Moore has achieved short-story sainthood in books like Self-Help, Like Life and her 1998 masterpiece, Birds Of America. But even her greatest devotees will find her latest collection, her first in over 15 years, woefully uneven.Moore, with her poet\u2019s eye and playful use of language, has always been able to find a savage, dark humour in pain and heartbreak. And there are glimpses of that in these eight stories, in which people, in the shadow of 9/11, confront divorce, illness and death with wisecracks.This time around, though, a lot of those laughs seem forced, and too many of her characters \u2013 a male poet here, a hipster singer there, a single mom attending her child\u2019s former nanny\u2019s second wedding \u2013 sound the same.Moore still creates images of startling power. In \"Wings,\" an intriguing but rather aimless take on Henry James\u2019s The Wings Of The Dove, a character says a dying spider plant \"looks like Bob Marley on chemo.\"And in \"Paper Losses,\" Kit, who\u2019s on a pre-booked Caribbean family vacation even though her husband\u2019s announced he\u2019s leaving her, breaks down on a massage table and describes her nose as a little drainpipe for crying. Exquisite. But Moore\u2019s images frequently pile up clumsily, and the puns emerge awkwardly from characters\u2019 mouths.Two or three stories feel like drafts or exercises. The war on terror forms a backdrop for many, but to no purpose. Still, there are a few gems. \"The Juniper Tree\" is a haunting fable about guilt, competition and the death of a friend. \"Debarking\" finds a Jewish divorc\u00e9 dating a WASP pediatrician who\u2019s got an unnatural attachment to her own teenage son.And in \"Referential,\" a modern reworking of Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s classic tale \"Signs And Symbols,\" a disintegrating couple deal with the woman\u2019s mentally unbalanced son.The writing here is clear and suggestive, the emotional undercurrents deeply felt, suggesting Moore doesn\u2019t always need to fall back on jokes to write memorable fiction.https://www.nowtoronto.com/books/stor..."}, {"userName": "Ayelet Waldman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5447027-ayelet-waldman", "userReview": "When I want to remind myself how to write, I turn to Lorrie Moore."}, {"userName": "Banushka", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47013915-banushka", "userReview": "gece ilk \u00f6yk\u00fcy\u00fc -40 k\u00fcsur sayfa- 1 saatten uzun bir s\u00fcrede okudum. \u00e7\u00fcnk\u00fc \u00e7evirisi \u00e7ok rahats\u0131z ediciydi. sonra yatt\u0131m. dedim ki \"ikinci \u00f6yk\u00fcye \u015fans versem mi?\"ve verdim. ama maalesef ayn\u0131 k\u00f6t\u00fc \u00e7eviri ve s\u0131f\u0131r editoryal \u00e7al\u0131\u015fma. bunu nereden anl\u0131yoruz, iki kere tekrar edilmi\u015f s\u00f6zc\u00fcklerden mesela, \u00e7evirmen bir kez \u00e7evirip yollam\u0131\u015f yay\u0131nevine, kimse de bakmam\u0131\u015f.yazar\u0131n \u00f6zel bir yabanc\u0131la\u015ft\u0131rma efekti yoksa -ki ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131mda \u00f6yle bir \u015feyden bahseden yok- hakikaten zor okunan, zor anla\u015f\u0131lan, anlat\u0131m bozuklu\u011fuyla dolu bir \u00e7eviri. ayda 20 kitap \u00e7\u0131kar\u0131nca b\u00f6yle olmas\u0131 normal tabii. ama arada iyi yazarlar kayn\u0131yor. ona \u00fcz\u00fcl\u00fcyor insan."}, {"userName": "Nicole D.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18822136-nicole-d", "userReview": "This is a super short book of short stories, that felt more than anything like a hard drive dump. It's like the publisher said \"How many have you got?\" and Moore said \"8 or so, but some of them are pretty old\" and the publisher said, \"I can work with that, send them over\" and thus we have a book. That's not to say there aren't nuggets of pure Moore brilliance in this book. There are many. She's a great writer and she can hit the nail squarely on the head! How could someone have come so close to death, so unfairly, so painfully and heroically, and how could he still want to strangle them?\" on a cocktail party conversation.This book is categorized as \"literary humor\" and there are some laugh out loud moments, but I wouldn't call this a humorous book.

We prostrated ourselves before her devastating humor, her effortless wordplay, her skewering of every late 20th-century pretension. Once when I met her at a reading, I think I freaked her out by being too adoring. Most writers would have been thrilled, but Moore is not most writers. A couple of decades on, my impression is that Moore's writing has not grown as much as it could have. Maybe that's because she's devoted a lot of energy to teaching other writers: it's hard to be a really dedicated teacher AND top-of-your-game practitioner. 'Bark,' her new collection of stories, has some of her trademark brilliance but overall feels a little flat, as did her 2009 novel 'A Gate at the Stairs.' Like all of Moore's work, 'Bark' is situated at the nexus of social satire and existential despair. The characters here are mostly middle aged, and dealing with the dead weight of disappointment. Loved ones have died, romances have fizzled into acrimony, careers have not soared in the imagined way. Death is constantly waiting in the wings. As the narrator in the final story, 'Thank You for Having Me,' remarks (while attending a wedding, no less), \"I had seen a soccer mom become a rhododendron with a plaque, next to the soccer field parking lot, as if it had been all those matches that had killed her. I had seen a brilliant young student become a creative writing contest...I had seen a public defender become a justice fund.\"At its best, 'Bark' is vintage Moore. One can pull any number of individual lines that sparkle--as, for example, this exchange between middle-aged Ira and his eight-year-old daughter Bekka on the subject of her mother's new boyfriend moving in, in the opening story, 'Debarking':\"Bekka shrugged and chewed. 'Whatever,' she said, her new word for 'You're welcome,' 'Hello,' 'Goodbye,' and 'I'm only eight.' 'I really just don't want all his stuff there. Already his car blocks our car in the driveway.''Bummer,' said Ira, his new word for 'I must remain as neutral as possible,' and 'Your mother's a whore.'\"My favorite story here is 'Wings,' based on Henry James' 'Wings of the Dove,' in which a failed female singer named KC befriends a dying man, Milt. Their relationship has a real sweetness, although it's continually threatened by the financial desperation felt by KC and her hapless boyfriend Dench, who suggests that Milt might write KC into his will. The ambiguity here \u2014 that KC can genuinely care for Milt while also considering Dench's suggestion \u2014 is something Moore handles perfectly. And there are some weirdly great lines, like, \"God is off in some cybercafe, so tired from all those biblical escapades that now he just wants to sit back and Google himself all day.\" Other stories, like 'Referential' and 'Subject to Search' are so short that they feel like sketches for a story rather than the real thing. And even 'Wings' falls short at the end, tacking on a coda that feels unsatisfying. While I don't agree with everything Michiko Kakutani said in her snarky review (she didn't like 'Wings,' for example), I'd have to agree with her that \"There are some deeply affecting moments here \u2014 mostly involving children \u2014 but they remain just that: moments, islands in stories that, for the most part, are heavy-handed and forced.\" Sorry, Lorrie."}, {"userName": "Jan Rice", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice", "userReview": "The cover of the issue in which the book's title story, \"Debarking,\" first appeared:\nA while ago I read a review of Lorrie Moore's Bark that intrigued me: There was something about her short stories being populated with extraterrestrials. I must have thought there would be a touch of sci-fi. Maybe there is, but not in the sense that I was thinking. Some of the characters are almost reptilian, with other characters caught in their clutches. The word \"extraterrestrial\" actually is used twice. Well, only once, in reference to the dialogue between a parent--a divorced parent--and her single teenaged offspring. The other time, it was \"space alien,\" and that was how a woman saw her soon-to-leave-her husband, only she didn't know that yet. I was thinking it's a good thing I was listening on audio. I was thinking this is what's wrong with short stories. They're about weird--make that bad--things that are observed, that just are: the ones that leave me feeling empty, wondering why did I read that? That's not fair, though; it wasn't that bad! There was kindness (people who let you depend on them?), or either there wasn't, just a fact: nothing to be done about it.Two of the stories are around 50 pages long, apparently not too long to call short stories, though, in all the reviews. For the most part they were the best. One of them was just awful, though--the subject matter, I mean; not the quality. A woman folk singer/band member who's approaching middle age and in a bad relationship befriends an elderly man, or at least they befriend each other. The relationship is \"I --it,\" not \"I -- Thou,\" rotten at bottom, but it's the old man who loses sight of that at the end, and she's the one who springs the trap. That one leaves me feeling slightly sick.Many of the professional reviewers describe the author's work as both dark and comic. I wasn't seeing the latter. The stories are beautifully read by the author, and I was hearing the unfunny and painfully absurd. But within a minute of picking up the book itself and reading the next-to-last one, a funny line struck me. The protagonist is at a Paris restaurant, ordering in French and not quite sure of her pronunciation and usage:When lamb was a food, was it a different word, the way pork and pig were? Perhaps she had ordered a living, breathing creature mewling in broth and fleece. (p. 162, \"Subject to Search\")The last story, \"Thank You for Having Me,\" was both the funniest and the best--about the absurd but not necessarily tragic.The observations were mostly acute. You say, Yes, that's the way it is, but the insight doesn't help.For those in the know, Lorrie Moore is said to be Nabokovian, an observation that goes over my head since only read the one and that was an era or two ago.I am not sorry I finally read Bark. The stories are gems, but they are dark gems, like ice crystals. I'm not sure about letting them lodge in my heart."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "From what I\u2019ve heard from other critics (e.g. Philip Hensher\u2019s somewhat harsh Guardian review), this really wasn\u2019t the best place for me to be introduced to Moore\u2019s short stories. My only prior experience with Moore\u2019s writing was one story in an anthology about libraries (In the Stacks) and the decent novel A Gate at the Stairs \u2013 probably her least representative book. I enjoyed the collection well enough, but some of the stories did feel rather thin, and also a bit dated \u2013 predicting Obama\u2019s election, or reflecting on the start of the Iraq War, for instance: \u201cLast year we gave up our faith and reason; this year we are giving up our democratic voice, our hope\u201d (from \u201cDebarking\u201d). Still, I enjoyed some of Moore\u2019s snappy, evocative turns of phrase, such as \u201ceyes a clear, reddish hazel, like orange pekoe tea,\u201d \u201cthe bridesmaids were in pastels: one the light peach of baby aspirin; one the seafoam green of low-dose clonazepam,\u201d \u201ca dried-out spider plant...like Bob Marley on chemo,\u201d or \u201cWhy are these things called napkins rather than lapkins?\u201d I\u2019m struggling even now to remember each story\u2019s plot, however, which suggests to me that they won\u2019t have much lasting significance.By far my favorite of the eight stories was \u201cWings,\u201d even if, as Hensher hedges, it\u2019s a tired theme: washed-up rock chick meets sweet old man and forms an unexpected friendship. I like KC as a main character, though, and the gentle tone of regret and the inevitability of aging (\u201cShe\u2019d been given something perfect \u2014 youth! \u2014 and done imperfect things with it\u201d) resonated with me. (I also love that the old fella starts his own Little Free Library.) Moore writes great banter-filled dialogue, especially the dinner party political debate in \u201cFoes.\u201dI will certainly seek out more short stories by Lorrie Moore; you always hear about her in the same breath as Alice Munro or Anne Tyler \u2014 two more masters of wry, suburban observation. Even if this wasn\u2019t the best collection for me to start with, I can see Moore has a keen eye for the absurdities and wonders of everyday life, and a striking way with words.I was delighted to win a copy through a Goodreads First Reads giveaway."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/787522-paul", "userReview": "First I'll just voice my irritation upon leaving the bookstore and learning I'd just shelled out $30 for a sub-200-page book. That's okay, though, it's got a nice Carol Devine Carson jacket and it's a new Lorrie Moore collection, so it's definitely worth the money. Until, of course, I discovered that the first four (of a total eight) stories had already been published in her Collected Stories collection, which I already own and have read. So in essence I've just paid $30 for half of a 200-page book. Yeah, we've waited fifteen years for this, as everyone has been chirping\u2014and so shouldn't we get more than four new stories? Sure, sure, sure, these have all been published previously in magazines, but still. I mean, really. I remember not having loved those four previously published stories when I read them in her last book, and again I found them good but not fantastic. At her worst, Moore's witticisms read like non-sequiturs that take you out of the narrative; they read like Moore trying to be funny. Whether or not this is actually the case is beside the point\u2014I have to believe that Character X would actually say witticism Y, and considering they sort of all sound just like Moore, that can oftentimes be difficult to fully buy. Anyway, once past the first four previously published stories, things got some kind of wonderful. The first of the second four is considerably longer (as is the first of the first four), and it's a great story with a nice balance of humor and pathos. It's a fairly quick sprint to the end thereafter; the final three stories take up maybe 40 pages, but they get better as they go along (making this whole sad tale worse is the fact that I'd read one of the new-new stories in Harper's recently, so really only three of these stories were new to me). Things take a bonkers turn in the final story when a biker gang shows up at a wedding, but Moore pulls it off in classic Moore fashion.While I think she's considered by a lot of people to be \"a funny writer,\" Moore can also be super dark, and I find these darker stories most successful\u2014the ones that balance the quirky witty humor with some real human suffering. This comes to a head in \"Referential,\" possibly my favorite story here. Echoes of Canonical Babbling, a little bit.

I went for a crazy ride, zig-zagged and looped, but in the end I got nowhere and have a slight headache.\"Living did not mean one joy piled upon another.

It was both the shame and the demise of them that hate like love could not live on air. And so in this, their newly successful project together, they were complicitous and synergistic. They were nurturing, homeopathic, and enabling. They spawned and raised their hate together, cardiovascularly, spiritually, organically. In tandem, as a system, as a dance team of bad feeling, they had shoved their hate center stage and shown a spotlight down for it to seize.  Paper Losses I'm the type of reader who likes to find a book's title within its pages and plumb it for deeper meaning. Lorrie Moore's Bark begins with excerpts from three poems: one that mentions a tree's bark, two about dogs. And although there is no story within this collection with the title \u201cBark\u201d, the word itself is used repeatedly: about dogs and trees; as a criticism about the way a person talks or laughs; to describe the protective cover of the brain; in the expression \u201csparky bark\u201d as a nickname for weed. I suppose whether it's on a tree or brain, or issuing from a dog's muzzle, all barks are used protectively; and if there's one unifying idea the variety of characters in these stories are in need of, it's protection: from the harming world and from each other. I don't think there's one happy marriage in this collection (the narrator in Foes seems satisfied, but there are hints that his wife is less so), and while divorced parents are definitely bonded with their children, these relationships aren't necessarily healthy or enough. Moore constantly skirts the edge between tragedy and comedy \u2013 the laughs are darkly so \u2013 but while there was much that I admired in this collection, it didn't exactly wow me. Some highlights, nevertheless:Debarking sees the narrator, Ira, starting to date again after his wife of fifteen years left him for another man. He muses:\nIt had been so long, the whole thing seemed a kind of distant civilization, a planet of the apings! \u2013 graying, human flotsam with scorched internal landscapes mimicking the young, picking up where they had left off decades ago, if only they could recall where the hell that was.\n After Ira has sex for the first time with a woman not his wife, she asks him, \u201cDid you get off?\u201d and that immediately reminded him of the time he was debarking a plane and stopped on the tarmac to tie his shoe and an airport employee had asked him that exact thing, \u201cDid you get off?\u201d So, \u201cdebarking\u201d seems to be reinterpreted literally; as in to remove the protective layer of bark and open yourself up to another. (I fear, but don't actually think, that I'm reading too much into that because of my habit of looking for the embedded title. And can't decide if it's too deliberate.) To return to Paper Losses and a woman who doesn't realise that her husband is about to mail her divorce papers, even as they live together as a married couple:\nIt had been a year since Rafe had kissed her. She sort of cared and sort of didn't. A woman had to choose her own particular unhappiness carefully. That was the only happiness in life: to choose the best unhappiness. An unwise move, good God, you could squander everything.\n The Juniper Tree \u2013 replete with a variety of transplanted trees that fail to thrive in an unsuitable zone \u2013 is a mournful story involving the twilight years of those Baby Boomer women who have rejected traditional gender roles:\nEvery woman I knew here drank \u2013 daily. In rejecting the lives of our mothers, we found ourselves looking for stray volts of mother love in the very places they could never be found: gin, men, the college, our own mothers, and one another.\n So, again, is that tree imagery too deliberate for the subject matter? Wings \u2013 a definite highlight until its corny ending \u2013 shows a middle-aged woman stuck (creatively, financially, romantically) with a man she can't quite unstick herself from:\nShe loved Dench. She was helpless before the whole emotional project of him. But it didn't preclude hating him and everything around him, which included herself, the sound of her own voice \u2013 and the sound of his, which was worse. The portraits of hell never ceased and sometimes were done up in raucous, gilded frames to console. Romantic hope: From where did women get it? Certainly not from men, who were walking caveat emptors. No, women got it from other women, because in the end women would rather be rid of one another than have to endure themselves on a daily basis. So they urged each other into relationships. \u201cHe loves you! You can see it in his eyes!\u201d they lied. \nAnd I also really liked the last story, Thank You for Having Me; about a woman raising a daughter alone after her husband left (so many husbands/fathers leave in these stories; whether dying young or climbing out a restaurant's bathroom window):\nAloneness was like riding a bike. At gunpoint. With the gun in your own hand. Aloneness was the air in your tires, the wind in your hair. You didn't have to go looking for it with open arms. With open arms, you fell off the bike: I was drinking my wine too quickly.\n I understand that this collection came fifteen years after Moore's previously lauded Birds of America, so while Bark was released in 2014, I can sort of appreciate why so many of the stories here felt slightly anachronistic; rooted in the early 2000s. Not only is Ira worried about embarking on a new relationship at the dawn of the second Iraq War (which he compulsively follows on TV), but there is mention made of Ollie North losing his senate bid, an evil conservative at a fundraiser sneers about Obama's missing birth certificate and links to old hippy terrorists before the 2008 presidential election, and a CIA spook needs to leave a Parisian love nest in order to return to America and do damage control just as the Abu Ghraib scandal is hitting CNN. I can't decide whether these references make the collection feel already dated (in the today of 2017) or if it will stand as the perfect encapsulation of the times.I picked up this collection because I had recently been delighted by Moore's short story How to Be an Other Woman, but unfortunately, nothing in Bark approaches that story's heft or humour. Other reviewers have noted that this collection doesn't seem to be up to Moore's usual standard, so I won't feel bad awarding it a middle-of-the-road three stars."}, {"userName": "mwpm mwpm", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13827810-mwpm-mwpm", "userReview": "According to Harper's Magazine, \"Fifty years from now, it may well turn out that the work of very few American writers has as much to say about what it means to be alive in our time as that of Laurie Moore.\" In some regards, I agree with this statement. Moore's stories are peppered with references to 9/11 and the subsequent conflicts in the Middle East (neglecting, however, the preceding conflicts in the Middle East). Likewise, her stories are peppered with references to new technology, punctuating our obsession with the new and with technology in general. In \"Debarking\", a newly divorced man tries to find something to hold onto as his country prepares to go to war with Iraq. In \"Foes\", the protagonist is a writer of no acclaim, inexplicably invited to a fund-raising dinner held by a literary journal; there, he is unwittingly drawn into a political argument that covers a political candidate who resembles Barack Obama and terrorism. In \"Subject to Search\" a relationship is surveyed from the vantage of a dinner, a relationship that is made unstable by the man's military connections. ...half a dozen young people in hooded yellow slickers were holding up signs that read HONK FOR PEACE. Ira fell upon his horn, first bouncing his hand there, then just leaning his whole arm into it. Other cars began to do the same, and soon no one was going anywhere, a congregation of mourning doves! - Debarking (pg. 30)He cleared his throat. \"I've written several biographies. Boy George. King George. And now George Washington. That's my most recent. A biography of George Washington. A captivating man, really, with a tremendous knack for real estate. And a peevishness about being overlooked for promotion when he served in the British army. The thing that will start a war! And I'm not like his other biographers. I don't rule out his being gay.\"\"You're a biographer of Georges,\" she said, nodding and unmoved. Clearly she'd been been hoping for Don DeLillo.This provoked him. He veered off into a demented heat. \"Actually, I've won the Novel Prize.\"\"Really?\"\"Yes! But, well, I won it during a year when the media weren't paying a lot of attention. So it kind of got lost in the shuffle. I won - right after 9/11. Actually, I won right as the second tower was being hit.\" - Foes (pg. 86-87)\"The internet!\" Tom said, scoffing. \"The Internet just reflects what's already in the human mind. Perhaps a little less so. Cruelty comes naturally to everyone. But if one is confused, and it's hot, one's bearings get even further lost. The desire to break something down so you can dominate it. Where did this idea come from? Whatever happened to simple cleverness? Instead we've got nude interrogations and sandbags soaked in pepper sauce?\" - Subject to Search (pg. 166)More than our obsessions with war and technology, Moore focuses on family. Whereas war and technology are relevant to only a handful of the stories (and only incidental in more of the stories), family is both present and prominent in the majority of the stories. In \"Debarking\", a recently man's perspective of family and solidarity is challenged by his divorce, the war in Iraq, and his relationship with a divorced mother. \"The Juniper Tree\" explores friendship as a form of chosen family. In \"Paper Losses\", a couple negotiates a family trip in the wake of their divorce. In \"Foes\", the writer's clumsiness at the fundraiser is transformed into a reflection of personal insecurities that haunt his marriage. In \"Wings\", a widowed man welcomes a young woman into his house - is she a replacement for his absentee daughters, or a last fling to fill the void left by his dead wife? and what is the young woman's agenda?? In \"Referential\", a widowed mother visits her suicidal son in the hospital, trying to provide stability for her fatherless son but unable to sustain a stable relationship. In \"Thank You for Having Me\", a woman abandoned by her husband reflects on her relationship during an unconventional wedding....Rafe mustered up thirty seconds of utterance in order to persuade her not to join them on this vacation. \"I don't think you should go,\" he announced.\"I'm going,\" she said.\"We'll be giving the children false hope.\"\"Hope is never false. Or it's always false. Whatever. It's just hope,\" she said. \"Nothing wrong with that.\" - Paper Losses (pg. 69-70)It was a wedding in the country, a half-hour drive, and we arrived on time, but somehow we seemed the last ones there. Guests milled about semipurposefully. Maria, an attractive, restless Brazilian, was marrying a local farm boy, for the second time - a second farm boy on a second farm. The previous farm boy she had married, Ian, was present as well. He had been hired to play music, and as the guests floated by with their plastic cups of wine, Ian sat there playing a slow melancholic version of \"I Want You Back.\" Except he didn't seem to want her back. He was smiling and nodding at everyone and seemed happy to be part of this send-off. He was the entertainment. He wore a T-shirt that read, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. - Thank You for Having Me (pg. 178)Moore's depiction of family, emphasizing divorce and the dissolution of the family unit, may be the most contemporary, and the most relevant aspect of her stories. Beyond commenting on the contemporary state of the family unit, Moore's depiction reflects the disharmony and instability in America in the early years of the twenty-first century."}, {"userName": "lucky little cat", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38160628-lucky-little-cat", "userReview": "keywords: the attractive ones are always crazy; more truth than they bargained for; the real, true history of the McDonald's House hostess; Hell's Angels at the wedding; you can visit me after I'm dead"}, {"userName": "Ra\u00fcl De Tena", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/335735-ra-l-de-tena", "userReview": "Cada vez me dan m\u00e1s envidia esas personas que, de pronto, en una conversaci\u00f3n, sacan a colaci\u00f3n alguna cita de un libro que han le\u00eddo recientemente\u2026 Y la verdad es que esta envidia no viene propulsada por el hecho de que a mi no me ocurra lo mismo, sino por la sutil variante de que a mi ya no me ocurre casi nunca. No s\u00e9 si ser\u00e1 porque acumulo demasiadas lecturas a mis espaldas, si es que ya nada me sorprende, si he puesto el list\u00f3n muy alto o si resulta que la era del d\u00e9ficit de atenci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n ha llegado hasta mi y no me sumerjo en lo que leo con la misma profundidad con la que lo hac\u00eda antes.Y si digo todo esto es porque, durante la lectura de \u201cGracias por la Compa\u00f1\u00eda\u201c, el nuevo libro de relatos de Lorrie Moore (publicado en nuestro pa\u00eds por Seix Barral), no pod\u00eda parar de volver sobre las mismas l\u00edneas una y otra vez, releerlas, saborearlas, repensarlas, aprehenderlas y, al fin y al cabo, dejarme llevar por la prosa de una autora que parece mimar cada oraci\u00f3n como si fuera un hijo con necesidades especiales. Ser\u00e1 por eso por lo que el formato de relato corto es el ideal para Moore: puede que, en novela, perdiera esa capacidad que tiene la literatura de Lorrie de ser una especie de pu\u00f1etazo en la boca del est\u00f3mago. Algo r\u00e1pido, conciso, certero\u2026 y doloroso.Al fin y al cabo, los relatos de Moore siempre est\u00e1n te\u00f1idos de dolor. Pero no del dolor exhibicionista de otros autores: el suyo es el dolor silencioso, casi sordo, de la vida contempor\u00e1nea. Las historia de \u201cGracias por la Compa\u00f1\u00eda\u201d est\u00e1n repleta de seres que sufren b\u00e1sicamente por y para un mundo moderno en el que las relaciones entre personas (hombres y mujeres, madres e hijas) son posibles, est\u00e1n al alcance de la mano, pero al final nunca ocurren. No de la forma dulcemente \u00f3ptima con la que nos han aleccionado gran parte de ficciones de los \u00faltimos siglos a partir de aquella invenci\u00f3n trovadoresca de la palabra \u201camor\u201d.Los personajes de Lorrie Moore, por el contrario, son divorciados incapaces de quitarse el anillo de casados, amargadas que se cre\u00edan eternamente ligadas a la infelicidad de su matrimonio hasta que su marido las deja por otra y entonces el resentimiento se dispara m\u00e1s todav\u00eda, buscavidas que se aprovechan de la soledad de los extra\u00f1os\u2026 Son gente que viven en un l\u00edquido amni\u00f3tico est\u00e1tico en el que la felicidad, como la dulzura, aparece a modo de luces en la lejan\u00eda, borrosas. Se\u00f1ales en la niebla. Son escasos los relatos como el de la madre y la hija en una boda o el de la pareja de ancianos en una cena institucional, en los que las relaciones tradicionales operan dentro de una normalidad m\u00ednima (aunque nunca plenamente funcional).Y, de hecho, si hay un relato en \u201cGracias por la Compa\u00f1\u00eda\u201d que funcione como s\u00edntesis de lo que significa Lorrie Moore, ese es precisamente \u201cSujeto a Registro\u201c, donde dos esp\u00edas se encuentran fugazmente para revivir un amor que no pudo ser\u2026 pero que tampoco podr\u00e1 ser nunca, cambien las circunstancias que cambien. En este caso, hay un leit motif casi de thriller que act\u00faa de impedimento, de \u201cruido\u201d en el mensaje entre las dos partes de una relaci\u00f3n. Es f\u00e1cil entender este caso por sus caracter\u00edsticas concretas, pero es que, al fin y al cabo, si quitas la coartada de thriller, encontrar\u00e1s que el resto de relaciones retratadas por la autora funcionan exactamente igual. Solo que encuadradas en un marco mucho m\u00e1s realista.La voz de Moore es fascinante: suele arrancar in media res y, en ocasiones, el lector necesita bastantes p\u00e1ginas para obtener un panorama real de lo que est\u00e1 ocurriendo (eso si al final llega a obtener tal panorama).

I barely could get through this short collection of amazing short stories because I kept putting down the book and picking up a pen to write! What a dummy I was\u2014I read these stories when I went to bed, and I ended up pulling several all-nighters. I\u2019m too old for this! But I\u2019m a pathetic amateur; I would kill to be able to write like her. She makes me listen hard and play hard. Every sentence is unique and precise, lovely and wild. And the way she plays with words; she\u2019s an acrobat! Her stories are bizarre and off-kilter, yet they\u2019re strangely familiar. She respects her characters and treats them tenderly. Oh, and there\u2019s a lot of humor\u2014how could I forget that?I know I\u2019m being too abstract and using way too many adjectives but I can\u2019t help myself. I\u2019m in awe and can\u2019t come up with enough right words to explain what it is Moore does that makes her writing so magnificent.Reading this was like some fantastic LSD trip: you see things in a buzzy, crazy light, and strange things are said and strange things happen. And yet, when you finish the trip, you realize these are real people, people who are vulnerable and disappointed. People who are sad and lonely, people who mourn losses they don\u2019t expect and who mourn the youth they so sadly know they are losing.Being the ever-picky editor, though, I did find two faults, minor indeed but bothersome nonetheless: Moore used the \u201cfrog gradually dying in lukewarm water\u201d bit in two stories. And she referred to the Amish in three stories. An editor should have caught these repeats\u2014when you find ideas or words appearing in multiple stories, the magic goes away\u2014but just for a minute or so. It just proves that Moore isn\u2019t perfect, though she\u2019s close to it.A couple of favorite quotes:\u201cThe bridesmaids were in pastels: one the light peach of baby aspirin; one the seafoam green of low-dose clonazepam; the other the pale daffodil of the next lowest dose of clonazepam.\u201dAnd:\u201cHe had never been involved with the mentally ill before, but he now felt more than ever that there should be strong international laws against them being too good-looking.\u201dOkay, enough gushing; I\u2019ve joined her fan club and now have to go back and read her other stories, starting with her last collection, \u201cBirds of America,\u201d which was written 15 years ago. I hope we don\u2019t have to wait another 15 years, because I probably won\u2019t be here, or I\u2019ll be too senile, to read it. Now that\u2019s a depressing thought. Hurry up Lorrie Moore!

She nails the situation in the first sentence, and goes from there. Some of the stories seem too abrupt in closure, but reveals another side of today's world from the norm.

There are moments that cause a bark of laughter (for me, that's the reason for the title, even if she didn't intend it to be so).

But this book is proof that sometimes even good writing cannot save an uninteresting story, and in this collection, it failed in nearly every case.I have no doubt that Moore is probably a very funny person, and there were a few moments throughout the book that were indeed laugh out loud funny. However, the collection's very purpose at times appeared to be dark comedy, and for me it failed miserably in that respect, and was like spending 2 hours enduring somebody who thinks they're hilarious trying too hard to prove it.I am usually surprised at how well good authors are able to write characters of their opposite sex, but this collection was very disappointing in that respect. It leads off with the story \"Debarking\" in which we meet a man named Ira who is the most obvious example of a man written by a woman wholly unable to channel a man's voice that I've read in many years. His story culminates in a scene so unintentionally funny that I almost lost the will to read on.Most stories referenced children, though mostly as background characters. These children were, of course, nearly all gifted, with the requisite amount of hipster quirkiness, and 8 year olds speaking like 16 year olds is the norm. It felt pretentious, as if the only way readers could be bothered to deal with children was to make those children into quasi adults.Many of the stories seemed to be set in the time period just after 9/11 and for me, this is such recent history, that no matter how justified, the angst about the Bush administration comes across as whiny and pass\u00e9. It was the literary equivalent of playing Who Let the Dogs Out? eight times at a wedding.Moore does some things right, too. I liked the plot twist in the story \"Foes\" and the theme was reminiscent of Saunders' \"Puppy\". Overall, though, I found the collection to be an infrequently funny, mostly uninteresting but occasionally rewarding trip through the heartbreak, depression and ennui of several middle aged couples.

I love many, many authors. Prior to publication of my books, I fantasized about getting blurbs on the back\u2014investing the blurb process with weighty importance. There were a number of excellent candidates, but I envisioned the perfect blurb from that special someone. But I wanted more than a blurb; I wanted a fan. Not just a fan, but a compatriot: an ideal reader, someone who would get my tragicomedy, my weird jokes that I don\u2019t bother explaining\u2014because you either get them or don\u2019t (damn it!), someone who would get the heart of darkness lurking behind every self-amusing quip.We\u2019d go beyond the blurb. We\u2019d be friends. We\u2019d talk books. And men. And heartbreak.I wanted, in short, Lorrie Moore. (Don\u2019t worry, Lorrie, I have no history of stalking\u2014except this one time, when I stalked Patrick Swayze at a weird Dirty Dancing rodeo show at Raw Hide outside of Phoenix, Arizona. It turned out that Patrick wasn\u2019t even there.)I just finished Bark, her slim\u2014too slim!\u2014collection of stories. This one made me sad. Not to worry: the writing is still excellent, still witty, and I\u2019m going to give you examples. Actually, I have to hold back because there are so many examples of awesome writing. But I got sad. These stories are about women who are not yet old, but are also no longer very young. Middle Age. When you\u2019re a man, you might be George Clooney. When you\u2019re a woman, we\u2019re talking something else: \u201c[S]he went out into the world like an Amish woman, or perhaps, even worse, as when the unforgiving light of spring hit her face, an Amish man.\u201d Yeah, that sucks. And these are women falling out of relationships. They are mostly sad women. Remember the discovery of self in \u201cHow To Be A Writer\u201d? Remember when one could still attract a man, even if it was the wrong man in \u201cHow To Be The Other Woman\u201d? Remember the young mom days spent in the children\u2019s hospital in \u201cPeople Like That Are The Only People Here\u201d? Oh, those are all sad stories too\u2014Lorrie is the best at funny/sad\u2014but the women were so full of vigor and glow back then! Bark struck me as, maybe, a little sadder than the others?The wit is still sharp, no doubt. But the nada that Hemingway harped on is so right there, in Lorrie\u2019s wry prose. Does this mean Middle Age is full of disappointment? Are women\u2014we women\u2014sad? Lorrie Moore is especially great in providing the candid detail. I love her for her insight, which is both funny and sad. But I\u2019m a little fearful. Is this my fate? I\u2019m forty-four right now, and I get the Amish woman comment. I\u2019m married, and I\u2019m giddy from this one: \u201c\u2019Marriage is one long conversation,' wrote Robert Louis Stevenson. Of course he died when he was forty-four, so he had no idea how long the conversation could really get to be.\" Yeah, this marriage thing is not what I thought it would be. In one story, Moore writes, \u201cIt had been a year since Rafe had kissed her. She sort of cared and sort of didn\u2019t.\u201d If you ask me, that\u2019s brave writing\u2014and Moore\u2019s writing is funny and sad, but brave too. Moore\u2019s writing is distinctively about the female experience, but it\u2019s so far removed from the trite or sappy or unrealistic. While I hope to end up in a better place than these women, Moore writes about women I know, real women.Oh, but she\u2019s clever. Do not forget how clever she is. The trick to writing humor, I think, is to let your lines drop--WITHOUT EXPLANATION. Just accept it: some people think you're funny, and some don't. It's the willingness to look like an idiot. You are not an idiot, but you\u2019re willing to take that risk. Moore writes, \u201cShe didn\u2019t know what she felt about Tom Waits anymore; his voice had gotten so industrial. \u2018I don\u2019t know. I just think one shouldn\u2019t have to wear goggles and a hard hat when listening to music,\u2019 she said.\u201d This is hysterical if you know Tom Waits; if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s not very funny.Elsewhere, Moore describes tired lovers. \u201c\u2019Come here. Lie on top of me.\u2019 Dench\u2019s face was a cross between longing and ordering lunch.\u201dInstead of the rainbow, her palate is most contemporary: \u201cThe bridesmaids were in pastels: one the light peach of baby aspirin; one the seafoam green of low-dose clonazepam; the other the pale daffodil of the next lowest dose of clonazepam.\u201dShe discusses plastic surgery of one character, noting that \u201che had some eye work done: a lift to remove the puff and bloat; he would rather look startled and insane than fifty-six.\u201dMoore captures the inner psyche in small lines like this one: \u201cHer own iPod would be an embarrassment: Forbidden Broadway, Sting, French for Dummies.\u201dIt is tempting to go on and on. But here\u2019s the thing about Moore: underneath the laughter, there is a somber and solitary truth.In one story, a character hears the dying words of her grandmother. \u201cMarry well had been uttered after she begged KC to get a teaching certificate. Teaching makes interesting people boring, sure, she had said. But it also makes boring people interesting. So there\u2019s an upside. There always is an upside if you look up.\u201dI\u2019ve never heard Moore reduced to being a writer of women\u2019s fiction or a woman\u2019s writer or that other one\u2014a chick-lit writer. Some of these stories did have male protagonists, but Moore is best when she writes about women thinking real women thoughts. There are, however, no reductive labels. Why might that be?She\u2019s writing about human experience. I\u2019d like to see Bark as part of a larger body of work. Young Women. Married Women. Moms. Divorced Women. Single Women. There are more women to come.

I think it's more like 3.5 stars, but the writing is so spectacular in places it's well worth the read. Moore is the mistress black humor. I laughed out loud. I dogeared half the book, and I even think I might need to change a story of mine because she already wrote it. (Good thing I read this book; what if I hadn't?) The issue is that a lot of the stories feel more like vehicles for great lines and sharp observations than like stories. I'm not sure I minded too much. The characterizations are vivid, and so are the descriptions. You feel as though you are right in each piece. Her endings are better than most short-story writers' these days, though I still felt that some of the stories petered out a bit. A few of the stories really popped. There's one about a couple having a quick lunch in London, before he has to depart for the States. Turns out he's CIA or something of that ilk and has to go mop up after the Abu Ghraib disaster--what sort of mopping isn't clear, but either he has to salvage his career, for it sounds as though he had been partly responsible for what happened in that prison, or at least to do PR crisis management. The story stands out because it's about real issues and real-enough-seeming people intersecting with them in a way that most of us wouldn't have access to. There's a joke about happy endings at the end, but of course there can't be any in story like this... a PR crisis that threatens to be like My Lai, not to mention what actually happened to the prisoners in Abu Ghraib, or to the troops, who \"are kids. They don't know what they're doing. They're sheep.\"He claims he told the troops never to do any of the things they did in Abu Ghraib, but \"She thought she could see what he was telling her. *Don't* code for *do.* It was what doctors sometimes did for the terminally ill who wanted to die: *whatever you do, don't take this entire prescription all at once with water.*\"Anyhow, there's a lot going on in this piece about understanding different languages and cultures, missed cues, middle-aged regrets, choices you can't undo, and things started that will never come to fruition. \"'If you're suicidal,' he said slowly, 'and you *don't actually kill yourself,* you become known as wry.'\"Which is what this book is. Wry. \"By June the chemical weapons of terrorism might prove effective at weeding the garden. 'This might be the sort of war I could really use!'\" one character says. My kind of dark humor, love it. In another story, in which the main character misses her chance to say goodbye to a dying friend and then has a sort of paranormal experience about it, one man has dated several of the characters. \"'Her garage was a pigsty!'\" the man says of the deceased. \"Now I was coming to realize that a lot of people baffled this guy, and that I would be next to become incomprehensible and unattractive. That was how dating among straight middle-aged women seemed to go in this college town: one available man every year or so, just to make the rounds of us all.\" Later, during a visit to the dead woman's house, the narrator describes the house's whacky front yard. \"Why would a man focus on a garage when there was this crazed landscaping with which to judge her?\"In one brutal story about a divorce between a couple who had met in the peace movement, making no-nukes signs but who now want to kill each other, have \"become, also, a little pro-nuke,\" the wife wonders at her husband's changed behavior. \"It was like being snowbound with someone's demented uncle. Should marriage be like that? She wasn't sure.\" And... \"Of course later she would understand that all this meant he was involved with another woman, but at the time... she was working with two hypotheses only: brain tumor or space alien.\" The stories that worked best for me came toward the end, \"Referential,\" in which a woman with a mentally ill son realizes that the long-time boyfriend she acquired when her son was well is not going to be there for her, or the son. \"Subject to Search,\" mentioned first above, and \"Thank You for Having Me,\" which just had so many true, funny gotchas in it that there's no way not to like the story. I wasn't that sure about the title. Based on the epigraphs, I assume it's a play on both dogs and tree coverings. Okay, so dogs: loyalties and betrayals. We betray every pet we have, I suppose. There are a few dogs. Perhaps there's one in every story, but if so I didn't notice. So trees: this makes a lot more sense because all of these characters are muffled and wrapped up with extra skin. It makes them tough, and perhaps resilient, but clearly they miss a lot, at least for long periods of times in their lives. The friend dies in the hospital while you are telling yourself you can always visit her the next day. I was glad I read this. As you'll see, most of what I quoted was the funny stuff. There are more profound lines and sections, but somehow they don't pop as much. I suppose that's the issue with snark. It bites out the rest of the story sometimes."}, {"userName": "Hank Stuever", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1435375-hank-stuever", "userReview": "Trademark Lorrie Moore, with extra emphasis on the segue into the AARP realm. I'm a big fan from way back, but \"Bark\" is an uneven batch of stories -- a brilliant sentence or two or three hidden in each one -- and, like all Lorrie Moore stories, they are stories in which people are gifted with the ability to say the things we all think of saying (or wished we had said) long after the moment we needed our tongue and brain and courage to function optimally. The characters in a Lorrie Moore story never have that problem. No matter how sad they are, they have Lorrie Moore's sharp wit always at the ready. This used to seem so delightful in her stories. Less so now.It took me forever to read this. Partly because I just haven't wanted to get down with a book after my disastrous attempt to read Donna Tartt's \"The Goldfinch.\" (Congrats on the Pulitzer, \"Goldfinch.\" I'm baffled.) But also because \"Bark\" failed the bag-of-potato-chips test (i.e., \"Bet you can't eat just one\").

In \"Debarking,\" a newly divorced man tries to keep his wits about him as the United States prepares to invade Iraq, and against this ominous moment, we see - in all its irresistible wit and darkness - the perils of divorce and what can follow in its wake.In \"Foes,\" a political argument goes grotesquely awry as the events of 9/11 unexpectedly manifest themselves at a fund-raising dinner in Georgetown ... In \"The Juniper Tree,\" a teacher visited by the ghost of her recently deceased friend is forced to sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in a kind of nightmare reunion ... And in \"Wings,\" we watch the inevitable unraveling of two once-hopeful musicians, neither of whom held fast to their dreams nor struck out along other paths, as Moore deftly depicts the intricacies of dead-ends-ville and the workings of regret\u2026 Here are people beset, burdened, buoyed; protected by raising teenage children; dating after divorce; facing the serious illness of a longtime friend; setting forth on a romantic assignation abroad, having it interrupted mid-trip, and coming to understand the larger ramifications and the impossibility of the connection... stories that show people coping with large dislocation in their lives, with risking a new path to answer the desire to be in relation - to someone... Gimlet-eyed social observation, the public and private absurdities of American life, dramatic irony, and enduring half-cracked love wend their way through each of these narratives in a heartrending mash-up of the tragic and the laugh-out-loud - the hallmark of life in Lorrie-Moore-land.", "title": "Bark", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050057-bark", "average": 3.56, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377707408l/18050057.jpg", "reviews": 986, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11746.Lorrie_Moore", "name": "Lorrie Moore"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050057-bark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18594607-bark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28463308-havlama", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25818135-gracias-por-la-compa-a", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22430323-bark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25923463-gracias-por-la-compa-a", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19631.Birds_of_America", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6076387-a-gate-at-the-stairs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90872.Self_Help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19634.Who_Will_Run_the_Frog_Hospital_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19632.Like_Life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
