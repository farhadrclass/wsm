Publication July 10, 2018. Although I have heard that Beatriz Williams was a good author, I had never read her before. I do have a number of her books on my TBR list however. Now that I have read one of her books, all the rest of them need to be elevated to the top of my reading list. I found her character development to be superb. The story line was well thought out and flowed well, while bouncing between the years of 1930, 1951 and 1969 and alternating between Miranda Schuyler Thomas and Bianca Medeiro. An Island of summer homes, where the rich and elite vacationed throughout each summer. Miranda was thrown into the mix when her mother married Hugh and Isobel's father. One of her first acquaintances on the Island was the son of the light house keeper, Joseph, one of the poorer working year-round residents. As the summer draws to a close Miranda is banished from the Island and Joseph is imprisoned for murder. Eighteen years later Miranda returns to the Island, still being dismissed by the social elite. Joseph has escaped from prison - is he back at the Island? Isobel, who had always laid claim to Joseph, is still as spoiled and remains in the inner circle of popularity. Miranda wants to reignite the love she had for Joseph and prove his innocence. It does not take long for the Island's secrets to begin to unravel."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "FULL REVIEW WILL BE ON JULY 18, 2018.\"Ms. Williams has written another book that will hold your interest but has a bit of confusing story line with all the back and forth.

This is the book you recommend to a friend when they say to you, \" I need a good page turner\". It is full of mystery, romance and drama. It captures you from page one and never lets you down. Of course until you finish the book and you want to read more. Don't try to explain to people what it is about just simply tell them to trust you. I do advise readers to pay attention to every character no matter how insignificant they seem. Every character has a part to play and you will understand as you move through the pages. This is the book where you may have to go back to see if you forgot something.

Her mother is set to marry Hugh Fisher, and after the wedding she will be spending the summer in his home with her new stepsister, Isobel. Miranda soon realizes there are two types of people on the island, the wealthy who come to the island to stay in their vacation homes and dine at the country club, and the working class make ends meet by catering to the rich. As Isobel shows her around the island, Miranda is drawn to Joseph Vargas, who helps his father in the lobster boats and lives in the lighthouse across from the Fisher family home. Before summer's end, Miranda's path changes course and she leaves the island due to tragic circumstances. Decades later when she returns she realizes the island is still full of secrets as she attempts to seek justice.What I enjoyed about this book was due to the alternating timelines, you had an idea of what happened early on but needed the rest of the pieces to the puzzle to see the whole picture. I wouldn't say there were any truly shocking plot twists in this book but I still had a hard time putting the book down. I really enjoyed seeing the people of the island through the perspectives of Miranda and Bianca. The setting of Winthrop Island and how the rich and working class interacted were strong assets and made the book all the more enjoyable. My only disappointment with the book came with the ending. I didn't feel like it was the most satisfying ending. I don't know how to describe it other than when I finished the book I walked away with a \"meh\" type feeling whereas up until the last few chapters of the book, I had really enjoyed watching the story unfold. It certainly isn't a bad ending but for me it was the weakest part of the book. I received a free copy of this book from the publisher but was under no obligation to post a review.

There is a unique setting on an island where the class system unfortunately plays a role as we see the residents navigate summers with visitors. There is also romance (more than I expected, but it was well done) and most importantly a mystery. At times I was unsure why the author was writing about a character, but all of her words, and descriptions of island life were intentional and played a role in the story. At times, with the authors words, I felt like I was near the water, or at one of the grand parties with the characters and that added an extra layer to an already great story. I liked the format of the changing years and the characters narrating, it was easy to follow along with each of the stories. I know this book will well received by fans of Beatriz Williams this summer when it is released and I can't wait to read reviews and chat with others about this book when it is released.

It's sensual, and paints evocative pictures. I forgot I was reading about a fictional place in America, it seems very European all the way through. So it's got that going for it.The conflict is also well thought out. Miranda makes an excellent main character, and the conflict of the well to do summer residents vs. the working class plays out well.The negatives: the plot kind of drags. I am honestly kind of tired of reading books where the narrative isn't linear. In this case as in many others, the jumps in the timeline as well as in the point of view don't help the plot. And to be honest I wasn't 100 percent sure what the plot was until the last 10 percent of the book.Also, the book is a bit soapier than I would have liked. I'm not sure what I was expecting but with a few of the plot's twists and turns I could hear the organ chords, \"Dun Dun DUN!\"Anyway, I don't know if I'd recommend. Perhaps my expectations were too high? There are lots of things I'd rather read. I would have quit but I got too far into it..

The decisions and mistakes made in one generation haunt the Fisher and Vargas families in a mystery with far-reaching consequences.

New money. Very little money. All three are enmeshed, entangled, and some even ensnared on one island off the coast of New England, where \u201cThe Families\u201d, as the upper echelon are known, use the area as their seasonal playground, sometimes at the expense of the Portuguese fishermen and their families who depend upon the surrounding water for their livelihood. Co-existing on this island together looks simple from the outside, but things on Winthrop Island are rarely what they seem. Expertly volleying between different time periods to weave the stories of the Schyulers, the Fishers, the Vargases, and the Medeiros, Beatriz Williams shares with readers the world of Winthrop Island, first at a wedding that blends two families together in joy and renewed hope, but it is short-lived as soon after, a murder tears that same family apart for decades. I was captivated by the characters from the first page. I wanted to know their secrets (I just had no idea how many there would be!) and understand where all of the puzzle pieces fit. As entrenched in the story as I was, I still would have never guessed what would ultimately unfold in the final pages, tying everything together and leaving the reader shaking their head with satisfaction and understanding. I highly recommend this book and give five stars to the story in which \u201cThe Have Nots\u201d possess far more than the \u201cThe Haves\u201d could ever dream.

Personalities are strong, and the plot moves along at a swift pace. As I reflect back over the book I realize that this could be a true life story. The characters in this novel represent life at it's grittiest level, earthy, heady and mysterious. The lives of the rich and famous intertwine with lower class workers on an island setting that reveals intoxicating drama and intrigue.I enjoyed this deeply involved tale of family, friends and lovers. A bit graphic for my taste, but that did not detract from the suspense as the plot unfolded, leading the way to the secrets that lay hidden amongst the islanders and the summer resident families.

I predict this will be a favorite book of the summer and many book clubs. I will be honest and say, I almost gave up before I past the first few chapters, because I realized it was going to be a story that jumped back and forth between 3 different time periods. Normally, I do not care for stories that do this, because it can get tricky to follow. This was not the case and I was so glad that I decided to continue on.

I couldn't put it down!!! I love The Summer Wives!! The story takes place on on one of those exclusive New England islands where the wealthy own summer houses and the year-round residents provide care and maintenance of the land, the homes and the people. The book features Miranda Schuyler - a young woman who lost her father in WWII. In 1951 she is introduced to the island by her new step sister, Isobel, as Miranda's mother marries Isobel's father. She soon meets the handsome, intelligent Joseph Vargas, who helps his Portuguese father on his lobster boat and the lighthouse he maintains. Miranda can't stay away. Tragedy ensues resulting in Miranda leaving the Island, not to return until 1969 when she reappears as a successful actress escaping the awful circumstance of her marriage to a famous director. Her mother and the other islanders, both the wealthy and the working class, have shunned Miranda for years, but she has no where else to go. I don't want to give to much away. The story is richly written and the plot moves quickly. The change in timeline is easy to follow - you won't want to put it down! I was sorry to finish it but the end was immensely satisfying! The Summer Wives is released on July 10 - buy it!

Although a graduate of the exclusive Foxcroft Academy in Virginia, Miranda has always lived on the margins of high society. When her beautiful mother marries Hugh Fisher, whose summer house on Winthrop overlooks the famous lighthouse, Miranda is catapulted into a heady new world of pedigrees and cocktails, status and swimming pools. Isobel Fisher, Miranda\u2019s new stepsister\u2014all long legs and world-weary bravado, engaged to a wealthy Island scion\u2014is eager to draw Miranda into the arcane customs of Winthrop society.But beneath the Island\u2019s patrician surface, there are really two clans--the summer families with their steadfast ways and quiet obsessions, and the working class of Portuguese fishermen and domestic workers who earn their living on the water and in the laundries of the summer houses. Uneasy among Isobel\u2019s privileged friends, Miranda finds herself drawn to Joseph helps his father in the lobster boat, but in the autumn he returns to Brown University, where he\u2019s determined to make something of himself. Since childhood, Joseph has enjoyed an intense, complex friendship with Isobel Fisher, and has a catastrophe that will shatter Winthrop\u2019s hard-won tranquility and banish Miranda from the Island for nearly two decades.Now, in the summer of 1969, Miranda returns at last, as a renowned Shakespearean actress hiding a terrible heartbreak.
