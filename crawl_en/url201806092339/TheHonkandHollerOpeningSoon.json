In each of her books you instead find valid characters, moving events and a great sense of both Oklahoma and the community these characters find there. All of these things are encompassed by a great story and succeed in conveying these things in a way that very few Hallmark films have ever been able to or honestly ever tried to do. In essence its feel good drama for the soul with only a smidgen of the guilt you get from watching the schmaltz on lifetime and other such networks. All that being said I have to say that while this was another good book from her I felt like it had a bit of either a rushed quality or an edge that indicated this was her real first novel a book written before Where the Heart Is the book that brought her major success and a film. How so? Well while all the characters are great and generally were conveyed well some of the plot lines never really played out as completely as they should have and as a result the book doesn't quite pack the punch you're hoping for in the end. I liked Bui as a character but also felt he seemed a bit stereotypically foreign and Vena's actions at the end of the book seem a bit nonsensical outside of completing her plot resolution about her sister Helen. Brenda also suffers as a character here because you end up wishing there was more to her story. The storyline with the bully Sam is also a bit rushed. With these things in mind the novel doesn't quite feel as polished and complete as Lett's first book and so leaves you wishing more had been done to complete and round out the story. As with  Where the Heart is"}, {"userName": "Brent", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863774-brent", "userReview": "This book pulled me in right from the start, held me tight for at least two thirds of the trip but eventually loosened its grip and dropped me, disappointed and alone, in the Oklahoma dust alongside Route 66. I stuck out my thumb as the eighteen wheelers and F-150s flew past but, try as I might, I just couldn't seem to catch a lift. Meanwhile, up the road a piece, the neon sign outside the Honk and Holler sputtered and went out.I was initially and immediately enthralled with the Honk's ensemble cast of characters. Each one is drawn with such care, having been given a personal arc and an individual and recognizable voice. The dialogue is superbly written. While the Honk and Holler Opening Soon is not nearly so epic in scope and is from a much different era, the fictional citizens of Sequoyah brought to my mind the characters from Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove.Possibly because I felt that relationship between the characters of the two books, I expected Honk to follow a different path and thus my disappointment when it didn't. By the end of the book it seemed that many of the characters' arcs were left hanging or forgotten as they became merely set pieces to a romance or a room full of extras singing Auld Lang Syne to Frank Capra's George Bailey.It is obvious from my rating that I didn't dislike this book, in fact there is much to recommend about it. It just didn't have the weightiness I expected. I guess I feel a bit duped, as if Wilma Driver just sold me a shiny new bungalow on a secluded cul de sac but which turned out to be a 40-year-old double-wide on a concrete pad next to the filling station.Hold on. Headlights. \"Hey lady, where you headed? Can you give me a lift.\""}, {"userName": "Jessaka", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4659464-jessaka", "userReview": "I picked this book out for a new book group I just started at our library. I wanted to begin reading Oklahoma Reads like we did in the last book group that I attended. So, I went to the Oklahoma Reads website and found this book and then decided that we should read one book a year that was written by an Oklahoma writer or was at least set in Oklahoma. I wasn\u2019t sure if I would like this book even though I had read Where the Heart Is years ago and found it entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised; I loved it, the way it was written and the characters. They reminded me of the people I knew in Creston, CA, where I lived for 5 years. Population 200. Cattle country. Pickups with gun racks and dogs in the back bed of the truck. You didn\u2019t have to lock your truck, car, or even your house. One of our book group members said that it didn\u2019t seem to her that the people in this book were real. I thought of her life and realized that she had never been around the kind of people that were portrayed in this book. While we live in a small town in Oklahoma, where this book takes place, not Sequoyah as in the book, just Oklahoma, it really depends on the circle of people with whom you associate. I grew up in a town like this. Of course, the people I grew up with were just going to high school, they were only beginning to develop their minds or not. It was in later years, when I moved to Creston, that I began to really know and love the people that were like the characters in this book. Billie Letts has created them perfectly, and she did this by sitting in a small caf\u00e9 in a small town of Oklahoma. I think if our new book group finds a book on next year\u2019s list that is horrible, I will suggest another book by Billie Letts."}, {"userName": "~*kath*~", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/319672-kath", "userReview": "LOVED this book! I am a huge fan of Billie Letts now. I read Where the Heart Is many years ago and loved it, so I picked this one up in the US for something to read, didn't get to it until I got home but loved it the minute I started reading it. She creates the most wonderful characters, and like my other favourite author Tim Winton, her skill is in creating characters that are flawed but beautiful."}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616365-marleen", "userReview": "Billie Letts\u2019 Honk and Holler Opening Soon is definitely one of my all-time top 50 favorite books. Re-reading it pleases me immensely. The reader is introduced to simple but genuine, quirky and amazingly touching characters. Most of them are regular customers and patrons of \u201cThe Honk & Holler (Opening Soon)\u201d, as they come together mainly to drink coffee, have breakfast, lunch or dinner, and visit at this side-road caf\u00e9, owned by Caney Paxton, a war veteran. The majority of the characters living in Sequoyah, Oklahoma feel quite authentic; they are plain and decent people (sometimes eccentric) and that representation of \"normal\" folks appeals to me tremendously. This time around \u2013 rereading - I was mostly moved by Bui Kahn, the Vietnamese immigrant. That man has the purest soul. Contrary to the book blurb, I don\u2019t think Vena Takes Horse is the one healing, or the force bringing people together - although she's an empathic soul, but rather that courageous little Vietnamese immigrant, barely mastering the English language, but touching everyone's heart. By the way, his turn of phrases in the English language are often hilarious. Strangely enough, you can\u2019t put an age to Bui Kahn. You can\u2019t put an age to most of the main characters really \u2013 you can only guess, and it's a bit like real life - not every fact is revealed. The events happening here are a slice of life. No more to it. Also to me, it\u2019s so refreshing that an author invites you into the life of plain people, and each one of them have possibly a good story to tell.As a European, generally speaking, I haven\u2019t been confronted with as many references to the Vietnam war. And it\u2019s a topic I haven\u2019t read much about, but here in this lovely little story, its repercussions are part of the scars people wear, and the author has a very fine way of briefly touching the subject and making it a part of the story.The only thing I can add at this point is: READ THIS BOOK and you won\u2019t regret it. It\u2019s an effortless and disarmingly charming read."}, {"userName": "Dennis", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9545381-dennis", "userReview": "This is a great read because it's like the comfort food served at the Honk. By the end of the book I cared a great deal about these quirky characters and their marginal lives. I finished the book on a road trip where it was reported Billy Letts had died. Her writer's voice was one on most naturally genuine and full of heart on the landscape of American fiction. I salute Billy Letts and wish she would have lived to produce a larger body of work. Her voice will be sorely missed."}, {"userName": "Bruce Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52636897-bruce-smith", "userReview": "This is at least the second time I've read this book, and it hasn't lost anything with age.

I didn't find it particularly amazing but there was SOME character development and the bad guy got his/her comeuppance. The Brenda storyline left me unsatisfied though, and while I released that not everything can be tied up in a nice tidy package, there were bits that didn't ring true for me - for example, the introduction and picture of my mind of Vena really didn't match up with eh outcome at the end of the book.I found Bui delightful though!

I feel like every time I write a review, my main focus is on characterization, but for me, the characters and how I feel about them are what really make a book for me. An author can write with the most elegant prose on the face of the Earth, but if I can't feel a connection to the characters, I can't get into it. This is the first time I've ever read anything by Billie Letts, but I'm already anxious to read more. I have \"Where The Heart Is\" on my shelf, and I know I'll be reading that soon! There is something about the way she writes her characters--they are so authentic and real. This is a fiction novel that I would not have a hard time imagining actually taking place. Actually, it's kinda weird to think that Molly O isn't out there waiting on Brenda or that Caney isn't wheeling around the Honk somewhere. Letts fills you in about her characters in such subtle ways, too. It almost brings to mind how you get to know people in real life--you don't sit down and hear their life stories all at once (usually). Bits and pieces here and there are dished out to clue you in on a person, and that's how Letts writes her characters. Even her minor characters were paid due attention so that even the regular Joes who came to the Honk had a voice. The dialogue was to die for--I could \"hear\" each of the characters as they spoke. I just loved it. I was also kinda surprised by how fast of a read this was. I'd sit down and look up 150 pages later shocked that I had read that much in seemingly so little time. This is an incredibly \"readable\" novel. Letts is not heavy on the descriptive language--hers is a more straightforward style. But certain passages really did take my breath away, such as the part where (without giving too much away) Caney finally faces his demons and sees the world around him. I loved flipping back to those pages again and again to immerse myself in that simple and yet poignant writing. Overall, Billie Letts has given us a story that everyone can relate to. It is a story about regular people living their lives and yet discovering the meaning behind it as they go along."}, {"userName": "L' Te", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3845097-l-te", "userReview": "Right off the top, I must confess that I hold a special place in my heart for stories that magically, profoundly, and brilliantly, bring together a collection of people that \u201cnormal\u201d society has labeled \u201cmisfits\u201d. Brown shriveled leaves, blowing with wild abandon and caught up in a maelstrom of loneliness and isolation. Emotionally crippled with the impossible reality of Never ... Never finding that place of belonging. No denying, Billie Letts has a special way of gathering these lost souls. Reverently placing them on the puzzle board of misshapen hearts, and having them fit together as the \u201cPowers That Be\u201d always intended. Society would have you blinded of there existence, let alone be troubled by having to acknowledge that they too have a right to be seen. Ah yes ... Most feel safe in the illusion that everyone is equal, but the ugly truth of it is that our \u201cperfect society\u201d is divided into - the ones that count, and the ones that don\u2019t. If you happen to be of the latter ... Then sadly, you are nothing but grains of sand sifted through the bottomless cracks of society - totally, unreservedly - forgotten. Until ... That magic moment.For me, this is the true uncovering of fantasy. That magical moment of creating something immensely beautiful from all the discarded broken pieces that have been carelessly, cruelly, and arbitrarily pushed aside, or worse, rendered invisible, through the countless eyes of - The beautiful people.Billie Letts masterminds this extra ordinary collision at The Honk & Holler Opening Soon. Nothing more than a rundown diner in the middle of nowhere, USA. Sparsely populated by a motley collection of wounded souls going about the business of survival in the best way they can. Suddenly, this seemingly insignificant hole-in-the-wall transforms an endless existence into a meaningful life, by uncovering that mystical place where the wandering misfit belongs. Unconditionally accepted and cherished for the misshapen puzzle piece that you are. Because you finally fit. You are finally \u201cseen\u201d. You found that special place called home.

That alone didn't have me thinking highly of this book, but it did get better.Caney Paxton, wheelchair bound but broken in far more important ways, returned home from Vietnam and opened a cafe. One drunken phone call changed the name from \"The Honk and Holler\" to \"The Honk and Holler Opening Soon\", a name that - considering the people it is home to - is more appropriate than you'd think. Caney lives in a room in the back and hasn't been out of the cafe since it opened. His waitress, Molly O, pines for the return of her high-school-dropout daughter, who ran off to seek fame and fortune as a country singer. The regulars come and go like clockwork, new customers are rare and nothing really ever happens. So when the door opens for Vera Takes Horse, no one is prepared for the changes she will bring to the Honk.A nice, if not particularly great, story about fairly average people whose dramas are bigger in their own minds than they are in reality, The Honk and Holler Opening Soon distracts the reader from the story with some of the unusual names and characters' weird behavior.

Written over twenty years ago by the time I read it, it is a little dated. Caney, a paralyzed Vietnam vet owns and runs the little Oklahoma restaurant in the middle of nowhere. He never sets foot outside. The war is still fresh enough for a few folks to call the little oriental man who shows up looking for work a \"gook.\" Bui soon makes himself valuable as does Vena, a female drifter who appears around Christmas carrying a maimed dog she found by the road. As Vena restores curbside service as a carhop, the cafe begins to thrive again. Molly O, the waitress who doubles as Caney's mother figure, takes a dislike to her but hardworking Vena, searching for her sister, soon grows on her by being a good listener to Molly's sad tales.

But this book ties the individual stories together in such a way that gives way to the overarching themes of finding love in the most unlikely places and families being created out of unlikely combinations. All together, it does not seem odd that when the jack of all trades for Honk and Holler Opending soon, a Vietnamese man learning English is injured in a heinous way, the whole little town pulls together as if he has always been one of their own.
