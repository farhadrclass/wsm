She has previously published seven poetry collections (in addition to publishing other books, articles, and essays).The\u00a0Still Pilgrim\u00a0project was birthed after O'Donnell made a\u00a0pilgrimage\u00a0to Herman Melville's grave, a few miles from her home in the New York. Melville had written of the passion of men going off to sea, but his grave plot in Woodlawn cemetery in the Brox was in only one of 'New York's five boroughs not surrounded by water\" (69). \u00a0O'Donnell composed a poem,\u00a0St. Melville,\u00a0with these words, \"Is this what you were called to still pilgrim,/to sleep beneath\u00a0six small feet of earth?\" (70). An old sailor interred in the earth, still but his work still lives on.It is O'Donnell not Melville that dons the moniker\u00a0Still Pilgrim\u00a0in these poems. All but one of these poems\u00a0have \"Still Pilgrim\" in their title. Here is a random sampling, thought: \"The Still Pilgrim visits Ellis Island,\" \"The Still Pilgrim Tells a Fish Story,\"\"The Still Pilgrim Honors Her Mother,\" \"The Still Pilgrim Sees a Healing, \"The Still Pilgrim Hears a Diagnosis, \"The Still Pilgrim Describes How Heaven is.\"These poems are sonnets\u2014metred with fourteen lines and a rhyme scheme\u2014and are arranged fourteen poems in four sections, corresponding to the four seasons and roughly shaped by the liturgical calendar. There are also prologue and epilogue poems, introducing and concluding this collection. The structure of tradition is juxtaposed against a contemporary life, the Still Pilgrim. More than once we hear the heal strike of her size nine pumps against the cobblestone of the pilgrim way. There are encounters between old and new and all the heartbreak and joy which comes through life's journey. The tone is both serious and playful, at turns exuberant and sad. \u00a0O'Donnell writes in her afterward:The poems in this book aim to tell a story, albeit by means of glimpses and gleanings rather than continous\u00a0narrative. (This, after all, is more akin to hwo we experience and remember our lives. Continous narrative is a form of fiction.) The Still Pilgrim's history consists of flashes of joy and visitations of sorrow, engagement with saints,and with artists (the Pilgrim's personal patron saints), epiphanies sparked by words and songs and stories, revelations triggered by encounters with beauty and terror. The gentle reader who perseveres through these poems is no longer merely a reader\u2014he or she is a partner in pilgrimage and a friend. (74).I had not read O'Donnell's work before and was caught off guard by these poems. The sustained character of the\u00a0Still Pilgrim journeys through all life's seasons, still a pilgrim from beginning to end. \u00a0This is the double entendre of \"still.\" It is more than stationary, but it also means continual persistence. Like Melville in his grave, lying still but whose work still lives on, \u00a0I hope to have much more encounters with the still pilgrim on the road ahead. I give this five stars. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Note: Many of these poems were previously published in various journals.

Immediately, she challenges the reader\u2019s sense of pilgrimage. If a pilgrim is one who moves or ventures toward a destination, what is a still pilgrim? O\u2019Donnell asks us to consider a pilgrim who pauses occasionally to collect their thoughts and evaluate themselves and their progress. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s collection is a series of poems that captures these moments of pause as free-verse sonnets. In this way a narrative of moments is constructed, and one can see the progress that the Still Pilgrim makes.Full review here: http://www.thecresset.org/2018/Lent/G..."}, {"userName": "Brady", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/558231-brady", "userReview": "I\u2019ve read Still Pilgrim twice now, cover to cover with breaks of course. Good the first time through, better the second. I pick out a favorite sonnet where I am told that the pilgrim must \u201cNot just love the world, but cherish it\u2014\u201d then I\u2019m led through the etymology\u2014\u201cfrom the Latin, carus, to the French, cher\u2014 / meaning hold to your heart, handle with care.\u201d World \u201cfrom Old English, weoruld, / meaning human race\u201dI slow my pace when reading the poem until I am still. \u201cNot just love it, but act like you do,\u201d the poet tells me. The poem: \u201cThe Still Pilgrim Considers a Hard Teaching\u201dA favorite poem, then turn the page and find another. Angela\u2019s sonnets play like a tango\u2014formal, traditional, but with a hint of Astor Piazolla thrown into the mix.Angela O\u2019Donnell is a significant American poet who is equally at home in a coal miner\u2019s house or at a dinner table with a New York mayor. She eats barbeque on the back porch in Central Texas and reads about saints and sacraments\u2014thoroughly Catholic and thoroughly free spirited, understanding that to know God one must find oneself at home with his creation.Each poem is a walk barefoot along a pebbled path, each step deliberate. Each poem urges you not so much to embark on a new Pilgrimage, but to understand the one you are on\u2014to feel the raw bitter winter wind followed by the delicacy of spring. Open your eyes, your mouth\u2014see and taste. Read the poems with a year or two to spare. Lay out flat in the rain and soak them in."}, {"userName": "Maryann Corbett", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34402942-maryann-corbett", "userReview": "I\u2019m reading an advance copy of Angela Alaimo O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Still Pilgrim on Ash Wednesday, and I so wish I could say, \u201cHere\u2019s the book for your Lenten reading!\u201d The only reason I can\u2019t is that the book\u2019s release date is April 1. So here\u2019s the book for your Holy Week reading, especially if you order it now, and for your pleasure in faith-filled poetry any time you pick it up.Like the best poetry collections, Still Pilgrim coheres absolutely. It has one theme, expressed in the book\u2019s title and the title of every poem. And it sticks firmly to one form, the sonnet. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s take on the form, though, is like Pope Francis\u2019s approach to pastoral care: merciful and generous and forgiving. Meters range from trimeter to pentameter, some of them tight and sprightly, others elastic, heterometric, even sprung, Hopkins-like. Rhyme schemes are many. Rhyming is tolerant of slants and assonances. Each of the book\u2019s four sections travels out from a complicated intersection of personal history, faith, poetry, culture both pop and high, and time, especially as embodied in the seasons. But the sections travel variously. All of them contain some poems about pilgrimage\u2014like \u201cThe Still Pilgrim Revisits the British Museum for the First Time in Twenty Years,\u201d which you can read here\u2014whether the sites visited are religious or cultural or personal. The content of each section, though, leans a little toward an additional particular idea. The first section grapples mostly with the poet\u2019s past, especially her childhood (see, for example, \u201cThe Still Pilgrim Honors Her Mother\u201d), and the second with the experience of motherhood, even of adult children (\u201cThe Still Pilgrim Hears a Diagnosis\u201d). In these two sections especially, the book is rich in the stuff of the lives of women. The third section leans toward the various kinds of bodily suffering. There\u2019s the suffering of one\u2019s own aging: the daily dolor of insomnia, the night sweats of menopause. There\u2019s also the pang of watching one\u2019s parents advance toward death, and of meditating their absence. The book\u2019s personal poems on this theme, like \u201cThe Still Pilgrim Hears a Story on the Feast of Frank Sinatra,\u201d are some of its most challenging and unexpected. The fourth section considers time more peacefully, in its regular passage in the seasons, whether they\u2019re celebrated in the liturgy or in the kitchen, at the stove, in the frying of chops in oil (\u201cThe Still Pilgrim Makes Dinner\u201d). The whole is summed up in a satisfying epilogue \u201cThe Still Pilgrim Ponders a Paradox,\u201d which you can read online here. The poems do their work not only with meter and rhyme and description and metaphor, but with allusions to Wordsworth and Robert Lax and May Swenson and references to the writings of saints like Teresa of Avila and Catherine of Siena. There is richness enough to benefit from repeated readings and to bloom further in the light of the book\u2019s afterword. These are poems that \u201cremember to sing and not to mumble,\u201d if I may borrow from the words of Rhina Espaillat, another poet I admire. And to borrow again, these are poems that demonstrate that the stillness is the dancing."}], "description": "Still Pilgrim is a collection of poems that chronicles the journey of life as seen through the eyes of a keenly observant friend and fellow traveler. The reader accompanies the Still Pilgrim as she maps universal terrain, navigating the experiences that constitute her private history yet also serve to remind the reader of his or her own moments of enlightenment, epiphany, and encounter with mystery. Each of the 58 poems of the collection marks a way station along the pilgrimage where the Pilgrim and reader might pause and ponder before continuing with the inevitable march forward. At the center of this travel book lies a paradox: the Pilgrim's desire for the gift of stillness amid the flux and flow of time, change, and circumstance. \"Be still and know that I am God,\" sings the Psalmist, channeling the voice of the divine. \"Teach us to care and not care. Teach us to sit still,\" prays the poet T.S. Eliot. Still Pilgrim depicts and embodies this human dilemma--our inevitable movement through time, moment by moment, day by day, and the power of art to stop both time and our forward march, to capture the present moment so we might savor the flavor of life. \"The Still Pilgrim's history consists of flashes of joy and visitations of sorrow, engagement with saints and with artists (the Pilgrim's personal patron saints), epiphanies sparked by words and songs and stories, revelations triggered by encounters with beauty and terror. The reader who perseveres through these poems is no longer merely a reader--he or she is a partner in pilgrimage and a friend. These poems have become your poems, this story your story, bespeaking our (un)common beginnings and our equally (un)common end.\" -- Angela Alaimo O'Donnell, from the Afterword", "title": "Still Pilgrim: Poems", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33946075-still-pilgrim", "average": 4.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485520930l/33946075.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1219132.Angela_Alaimo_O_Donnell", "name": "Angela Alaimo O'Donnell"}], "type": ["Poetry", "Religion"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33946075-still-pilgrim", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13006008-saint-sinatra-and-other-poems", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21971450-mortal-blessings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13006011-moving-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18430428-waking-my-mother", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2796862-mine"]}
