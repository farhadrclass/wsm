Their story is told entirely in epistolary form, as lifelong friends Kate and Cecilia exchange letters. Kate is experiencing her first Season in London, while Cecy is left home in the country. But life gets unexpectedly complicated when both Kate and Cecy meet up with Thomas (aka the Mysterious Marquis) and his friend James, who are trying to stop a dark magical plot that endangers them all. Vauxhall and vouchers to Almacks are mixed with spells that turn people into trees and a magical blue porcelain chocolate pot.This novel is noteworthy for having its genesis in a Letter Game between the two authors, each of them writing to the other in the character of one of the girls, and neither of them knowing what the other would be writing back to in response to their latest letter. With some post-game trimming and polishing, they actually ended up with a publishable novel.Given that each author was writing as a specific character, it's interesting that both of the girls' voices sounded so much alike to me. It was a little difficult to distinguish between Kate in the city and Cecy in the country, except that Cecy has discovered she has some magical skills and Kate has somehow found herself in an engagement of convenience. Notwithstanding the post-game editing, I could also see several bits and pieces of the plot that didn't really lend themselves to the work as a whole, and the plot occasionally got a little confused and muddled (and I don't think it was just me). However, the story overall is a fun, light Regency, with some nice bits of magic and witty dialogue between the characters. Some of the humor was truly delightful, like when Cecy writes to Kate:Aunt Elizabeth and I called at the vicarage yesterday and spent a stimulating afternoon listening to the Reverend Fitzwilliam discourse on the Vanities of Society and the Emptiness of Worldly Pleasures. Aunt Elizabeth hung on every word, and we are to return and take tea on Thursday. I am determined to have the headache Thursday, if I have to hit myself with a rock to do it.There are even a few deeper moments, like when Kate is examining a magical chessboard with enameled pieces:I bent close to admire the detail of the white queen's cloak (I could see the black-tipped ermine) and jumped. \"Oh, it moved!\" I exclaimed--for as I watched, the queen had taken a step to her left, to a black square, where her cloak showed to best advantage. As I stared, the white knight beside her stepped aside politely to clear the next square. \"That's not a proper knight's move,\" I protested. \"They're just wandering around at random.\"Lady Sylvia smiled. \"This is the King's pride and joy,\" she explained, \"but the enchantment merely animates the pieces. It doesn't instruct them in the finer points of play.\"\"How dreadful,\" I replied, \"to be caught up in a game and have no idea of the rules.\"\"It's not a plight unique to this chess set,\" Lady Sylvia observed dryly.A light read, but clever and enjoyable, with just a little romance."}, {"userName": "Gail Carriger", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2277045-gail-carriger", "userReview": "One of my all time favorite books, Sorcery and Cecelia started out as a letter game between two brilliant writers. The authors clearly enjoyed themselves and the resulting novel is a joy to read, both as a story and as a window into the fun experienced by to marvelous authors. Set in Austen-like 1817 England, which just happens to have some very polite magic rolling around, the plot is largely driven by excellent characterization, two strong heroines, and a great deal of humor. There are several ditty-like romances, and a tidy little ending that makes for an amuse-bouche of a read - tasty and bite sized. There are two follow up books, however, this one stands beautifully alone. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly", "userReview": "A perfectly charming little epistolary tale with a number of problems. This is the story of Kate and Cecelia (does this spelling of the name bother anyone else? I had to type that name three times before I got it right, it seem so unnatural!) two cousins who are seperated for a few months while one experiences the London Season, and the other stays on their country estate, and write letters back and forth to each other. Kate falls into the path of an evil magician, Cecelia trips over related magical problems of her own- plotting and hijinx to follow. Appropriate males are found to counterpart them, and we're off!The good bits: The wannabe Jane Austen voice was fairly good, there were several witty one liners that were laugh out loud worthy, there were some truly excellent capers, and I appreciated the spirit of both the young ladies. Also, it really does captivate you and for the most part sweep you away. I finished this book in a matter of a few hours. If you shut your brain off and enjoy it as a light, fluffy, delicious bon bon, its wonderful.The problems: The authors wrote this by doing \"The Letter Game\"- in which the participants write letters to each other in character. You're not allowed to discuss the plot at all, it just has to unfold organically. In this particular case, the authors began to coordinate the plot towards the end so as to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion, but other than that, it is obvious that this was not planned very well as a book. The plot doesn't fit very well together, at least one of the romances is ridiculous, and there's a good deal of world building that is left out- understandable since the book is in epistolary form, between members of the same family (though its never made clear how they are related) and the authors wouldn't see the need to do a bunch of exposition. I do feel that some compromise between reader enjoyment and realism could have been made, though. Another thing that bothered me- it seemed like the authors did all of their research out of Georgette Heyer and a basic reference guide to the times and grabbed random bits. And they were wincingly, pompously, and embarrassingly proud of dropping clunky bits of historical slang, information, and characters into the text. These two-bit, apparently rather low on the social register characters go to intimate parties at the Countess de Lieven's? and Lady Jersey makes it a point to talk to them (and of course they use her nickname, because they are such close, personal friends)? Both male characters totally know the Duke of Wellington! Its kind of like people writing out a Star Wars roleplay, and insisting that their characters are just like the ones from the movies and they're best buddies, and going around saying, \"Oh, so Luke and I were hanging out the other day...\" and expecting this to impress everyone. It was simplistic and unrealistic.Oh and speaking of unrealistic- the tones that these girls wrote their letters in. They're supposed to both be adolescent females, and they both have the voices of thirty-something year old women with 20 years of world-weary experience behind them- except when they need to be adorable and naive for our male characters, or enthuse over clothes. One of them actually refers to her sister, one year younger than her, as \"the poor child.\"Having said all that though- I did order the next two books in the series as soon as I finished this one. So no matter how cranky the above stated problems made me... must've not bothered me that much!"}, {"userName": "Tijana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35343816-tijana", "userReview": "Ljubi\u0107a sme\u0161tenih u period Regentstva ima kao partizanskih filmova; fentezi ljubi\u0107a koji se de\u0161avaju u tom periodu ima... mal\u010dice manje.Sorcery & Cecelia: or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot je sve \u0161to mu ime ka\u017ee.

It's a little bit mystery, a little bit fantasy, there's a little magic and a little romance, all set in the early 1800's England.The story takes place around cousins Cecelia and Kate, one goes to London for the summer, the other remains in the country. Their correspondence begins ordinarily enough (what tea party had been attended, or the trouble with hand-me-down dresses), but you get a sense very early on that Cecelia and Kate are kindred spirits and that there's more to them than the dresses they wear or the balls they attend.Soon after their written correspondence starts things begin to grow troublesome - and it's clear that all is not as it should be. Both girls quickly become involved in a dangerous and magic-related mystery. The cousins are eager to help the other - best they can - through their letters, as each tries to manage the mystery on their end. I only gave this book 4 stars because, for me, the beginning was a bit dull and it took a while for the plot to evolve. Also, it took a while to sort out everyone on their relations. However, after about a quarter of the book, and definitely by the middle, I was pulled in and realizing that the plot was far more complex than I'd assumed.Also, I applaud authors Wrede and Stevermer for telling one story with two protagonists. I enjoyed both stories and felt that both Cecelia and Kate were dynamic and complete characters."}, {"userName": "Emma (Miss Print)", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75857-emma-miss-print", "userReview": "Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stevermer first published Sorcery and Cecelia under that that title in 1988. In recent years, thanks to reprints with shiny new cover art by Scott M. Fischer in the case of the edition I read as well as two new sequels, this book has regained popularity and visibility. Aside from that, one of the most important things to know about this book is its alternate title: The Enchanted Chocolate Pot: Being the Correspondence of Two Young Ladies of Quality Regarding Various Magical Scandals in London and the Country.Wrede and Stevermer wrote this book as a writing exercise of sorts called the Letter Game. Patricia C. Wrede wrote as Cecelia while Caroline Stevermer responded with Kate's letters. They did not plan the plot before they began writing.Almost every review I have found online describes Sorcery and Cecelia as a cross between the books of Jane Austen and those of J. K. Rowling. The comparison does make sense, but I might venture to say I liked this book better than any of the Harry Potter series.The year is 1817 in an England where magic is as much a part of life as letter writing. The latter is of particular importance to Kate and Cecelia as the cousins spend the novel in separate parts of England. While Kate and her more glamorous sister Georgina are in London enjoying a proper Season, Cecelia, much to her consternation, is left to languish in the country with her brother Oliver for company (at least until he's turned into a tree).Problems begin for both cousins when Kate accidentally intercepts a rather nasty pot of chocolate in a London garden that was, apparently, meant for the eccentric Marquis of Schofield. If only he would explain exactly why.Meanwhile, in the country, Cecelia finds herself following a shady figure spying on Cecy's new (and surprisingly popular!) friend Dorothea. When Cecelia repeatedly catches him in the act of spying, James Tarleton repeatedly refuses to offer any information.As the girls learn more about these mysterious men, and the mysterious events, it becomes clear that something big is happening--big enough that evidence of the plan can be seen in both London and the country. The only question is what, exactly, is going on and if Kate and Cecelia can stop it in time.Being an homage to Jane Austen, this novel has not one but two romances. Which couple is better has been a hot topic since the book came out. The librarian who recommended the book to me feels very strongly that the Mysterious Marquis and Kate are a more enjoyable match to observe. For my part, I preferred Cecelia and James.This novel avoids all of the traps that can make an epistolary novel awful. There is no repetition, there is dialogue, the narrative reads like a, for lack of a better word, normal book in that the narrative flows in a fairly traditional way. There is neither too much information nor too little. And, most importantly, the novel is filled with suspense, action, humor and romance that shines through both Cecelia's and Kate's letters.But then from two talented and well-known fantasy writers, what else can a reader expect but perfection?Sorcery and Cecelia is the first in a series of books featuring Kate and Cecelia. Their stories continue in The Grand Tour (2004) and The Mislaid Magician of Ten Years After (2006).You can find this review and more on my blog Miss Print"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1064222-rebecca", "userReview": "Hmn. How did I feel about this book?If critique previous to my reading would have been negative, I would probably be contrary and say \"Nonsense, it was charming.\"However, I had several reservations with this book.1. It started out slow and confusing. It took me until around page 100 to really like the story line. I had a very difficult time sorting out Kate and Cecelia... there was very little to distinguish them one from another (the awful portraits of them on my cover didn't help!). Top that with mirror-image characters surrounding each of them divided between London and Essex. Thomas vs. James. Aunt Charlotte vs. Aunt Elizabeth. Georgina vs. Dorothea. It didn't matter which young lady was writing... to me they and their party were the same. For me this was so obvious that I would be surprised to hear that the authors didn't plan this (or at least notice). The only fairly well developed character was Sir Hilary.2. It really irked me that the letters morphed into narration two or three paragraphs in. Each letter starts as a first-person description of events, but quickly becomes an unidentified omniscient narrator with quoted dialogue. No one writes a letter like this. Perhaps the authors were trying to make it feel like a movie where the letter-writer begins the narration that flashes back into the actual story. I didn't buy it.3. I find it highly implausible that a young lady who has just been abducted by enchantment will start off her letter calmly reciting what color dress she wore to the party. (First she would declare, \"You won't believe what happened!\" Then she would drop in lines about her dress as she is describing the events leading up to her abduction... duh!) The tone of each letter was discordant with what had happened.4. The anachronistic ways in which Kate and Cecy pushed aside all Victorian guidelines of propriety were also hard for me to believe. Elizabeth Bennett herself wouldn't have thought to be so impertinent and impulsive.5. The ending was too convenient and contrived. (\"Oh? You mean there's a homing beacon on my locket? How fortunate!\")6. This is just being finicky, but I really thought the title was cool before I read the book... Obviously \"Sorcery & Cecelia\" just rolls off your tongue, but what about Kate? What is this book without Cecelia AND Kate? I tried to come up with a better title, but I couldn't make it work. I think I would have just stuck with The Enchanted Chocolate Pot... but that would make sequels more difficult.Okay, but I said it was charming. I know it is meant for a young adult audience and the method of passing letters back and forth between the two authors without sharing a plot was meant merely for fun. I really liked the overall premise. I just thought there was much more potential that wasn't reached."}, {"userName": "Carol.

It begins as exchanged letters between two teenage girls, seemingly Victorian era. I can see how this would be attractive to collaborating authors, and fans of letter writing everywhere, but I always have trouble wrapping my head around that kind of narrative. Once it gets going, it gets a little better. The authors do a decent jobs of within-letter asides that help explain things, but it's clearly best if one already knows something about Victorian society, structure and constraints. In the afterword, the authors explained how they didn't communicate directly about the plot until three or four letters within the ending of the novel, which is amazing given the relative coherence of the book.Being generous, I rounded upward; I think this is a 2 and a half star book for me, but if you like the narrative structure, undoubtedly it will rate higher."}, {"userName": "Gillian Berry", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13535966-gillian-berry", "userReview": "I first read this book a bajillion (okay, fifteen) years ago and remembered nothing about it (which makes sense, since I was like nine).

However, they are also intelligent young women and soon the plot begins to thicken as two seemingly unrelated \"suspicious incidents\" involving maddening-yet-charming young men and bouts of sorcery begin to take place around the girls. Before they know it, the girls are embroiled in helping their new-found friends (and, in truest Austen-esque sense, potential lovers...???) avoid the dastardly schemes of two noted bright-lights of society (who also happen to be well-versed in the most evil uses of magic!)I didn't find this quite the \"Jane Austen meets Harry Potter\" that it's been touted as (no doubt as a marketing device in light of the resurgence of popularity for JA in recent years, and the blockbuster that is HP--this book was originally written in the mid 1980s, though!) but I didn't find it up to the standards of either. While I was definitely amused, it certainly wasn't as witty or deep as Austen, but I really don't think it was trying to be. Also, this is NOT that \"magical\"--one can learn to be a wizard and magic is certainly used, but it's not like HP in that the world is very much Regency England with a small smattering of magic worked in, rather than being a whole world created around magic. That is not to say, though, that it wasn't a delightful romp through Regency England complete with wizardry! :-> I give it four stars because the first 1/3 of the book was a bit slow-moving for me and I found some of it to be a bit sloppily written and confusing (I read this with my sister and she agreed, so it wasn't just me!) Perhaps this stemmed from the fact it was originally written as a letter game between the authors, so I'm not sure how well plotted-out the story was to begin with, though one would have hoped later editing would have cleared that up.

In many ways, it reads like a 'typical' regency romance novel. Two young girls are corresponding; one is in London for the season, the other has been deemed too immature and likely to get in trouble and so remains on the country estate. The letters are filled with descriptions of items of clothing, dance, and people typical of that era.The twist is the inclusion of magic. In this world, there are wizards and magicians all around, hatching evil plots which must be foiled. Like His Majesty's Dragon and Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, this book combines fantasy elements with the traditional historical setting. In this book, it presents the perspective of very young and sheltered girls - which is probably why this is considered a young adult novel.As mentioned in the afterword, this book originated as a letter game between the two authors. They agreed on a world and starting conditions; then they each assumed one character and wrote letters to each other. Neither author knew where the plot would go; they wrote their letters in reaction to the previous letter. After all of the letters were collected, they got together to edit the letters to make the final version a little bit more cohesive. While this probably adds to the charm and the uniqueness of the characters, it also means that the plot is a bit flimsy. Nothing is too complicated; often, magical intervention occurs just in time to resolve whatever little problem occurs. And there don't seem to be any limits to what magic can accomplish; while the spell-process is primitive and superstitious at some points (charm bags made out of herbs?) at other points the authors allude to advanced equations necessary for spell-casting. This novel is unique enough to make it a fun read for anyone interested in historically based fantasy; it also should appeal to anyone interested in traditional regency romance, if you don't mind a bit of magic."}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4382458-lindsey", "userReview": "I first read this book as a teenager after searching out basically anything and everything of Patrica Wrede's (her Enchanted Forest Chronicles series basically represents my entire middle school reading experience considering how many times I've re-read it...).

I can't get over how perfectly awesome the two heroines are, and how great they are as role models to girls. I could only wish to have their propriety, sensibility, and tact at some point in my life! The Regency era setting was done perfectly, and the way that magic was mixed in as a natural aspect of the time was done seamlessly. The romance was there, but did not overwhelm the plot in the slightest and the hate-to-love nature of both relationships was perfect.

I love the epistolary style, Regency feel, and twisting plot (with adorable romance thrown in for good measure). It is one of those books that would have garnered a 5 star review from me a few years earlier, but a few things bugged me. Such as, all the Regency slang thrown about. It was goofy and delightful but kept me from taking anything too seriously. Or the main characters, who seemed really similar. I realize they are written by different authors, but while I could keep track of any number of suitors and aunts, remembering which one was which took effort. I thought of them as 'the London one' and 'the country one' for the longest time. (I liked Kate better) The suitors are even worse. By the end they began to show their own personality a bit (a wee, tiny, tiny bit) but mostly it felt like they were the same person except one had magic. (James, however, was everything that is amiable and superior. I liked him a lot) Not necessarily a bad thing, but at the beginning there were so many young men introduced (from Twins to neighbor boys) that I was reminded of writing as a teenager. You write in a lot of men and cast about for whichever one your heroine has the most chemistry with. Thankfully, in this the author succeeds, as the characters have dramatic misunderstandings followed undoubtable chemistry. The book has everything you could want, from sham betrothals to balls to evil villains to witty one liners to untapped magic and two dark, brooding romantic leads.

It's light and entertaining enough to be worth reading despite a few major flaws. To anyone who picks up this book, I would suggest first reading the \"Afterword\" at the end of the book (it really should have been a \"Foreword\"). It explains how the book came to be, doesn't contain any plot spoilers, and I think had I read the book with that knowledge I might have enjoyed it even more. My main complaints were, first, that the language in the book is a little too contrived. The authors seemed to be trying to create a Austen-like world--England in the 1800s--but they are American, and many of the supposedly \"British\" phrases they used just seemed fake. I got tired of the term \"goose-witted\" being used repeatedly after about two chapters, and that's just one example. I kept thinking that maybe this is just the way a couple of teenagers would have talked, but couldn't help but find it annoying anyway. Secondly, even though there is a different author behind each main character, the voices were difficult to differentiate. I found myself constantly wondering whether this letter was from Cecy or Kate and having to look back at the beginning of the chapter to see whose story was being told.

(In fact, I might follow this up with my long-awaited JS&MN reread, maybe?) Or even Gail Carriger's Soulless, though that one's in the Victorian era; also an appropriate comparison, considering I noticed on GR just now that Carriger cites this as one of her favourite books. Just as modern-day urban fantasy gravitates towards snarky, hard-bitten loner hero(ines), there's a definite niche for historical fantasy where the women are witty and clever and put-upon and everyone gets together in the end.Reading this was also my purposeful way to cleanse my palate after The Magicians, by diving into something just light-hearted and fun. It's super cute, if predictable, and I wish magic/the role of magic had been fleshed out a bit more. Still, 3.5 stars! As one of my fellow reviewers has summarised it, Sorcery & Cecelia is an enjoyable beach read for when you want some fluffy fare but don't want to think too hard (and I liked the characters enough that I'll probably continue the series, too).Probably the most fascinating thing about this book, actually, is how it was written, which the Afterword explains -- I was curious if the two authors really didn't discuss plot with each other, and was pleased/impressed to learn that Wrede & Stevermer did commit to The Letter Game. So it's an epistolary novel, written in the form of letters between the two authors/characters, improvised along the way with no planning between each other about the plot.I used to do letter games back in high school but they always petered out after 3 letters or so, so I'm fascinated to see this one finished and polished and so coherent. I'm interested in collaborative fiction and especially the mechanics thereof, so I love seeing the different ways writers can cobble their stories together. This one's a quick delight to read."}, {"userName": "Punk", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk", "userReview": "YA Fiction. I had a lot of trouble getting past the first three pages of this -- it was exposition heavy and did not grab my attention -- but once I gave it another shot, I found it utterly charming. Cousins Cecelia and Kate write each other letters during the summer of 1817, while Kate is in London for the Season and Cecelia is stuck at home in the country. This is another of those Englands that just has magic lying around to spare, no big thing, it's just there, good for fighting off Napoleon and stuff.If you like dry humor, epistolary novels, witchcraft, duels, Jane Austen, Regency romances, mysteries, antagonistic relationships full of squabbly love, plucky heroines, and men that need a little rescuing, then you'll love this. It's like Jonathan Strange Mr Norrell meets The Changeover, and it's very adorable, though not without its problems. The girls' voices are so similar it's quite difficult to tell them apart. The pacing is often awkward and predictable, an unfortunate artifact of the \"letters game\" the authors were playing by each contributing one character's letters to the story; similarly, this leads to a lot of repetition. There's also the unanswered question of what exactly happened to Cecelia's mother, and, even more distressing, Kate's utter carelessness in losing both of her parents. It's also unclear how old the main characters are, but ultimately it isn't a big deal; they're clearly mature, resourceful girls. They felt old enough to me. I just had to trust that the men they were hanging around weren't too old for them. But those are small problems. I loved the book, and I say that as someone who just read it for the first time as an adult. I only wish I had found it back when I was a kid.Four stars because once I finally got past the first three pages, I literally couldn't put it down. Now for the sequel!"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1116929-becky", "userReview": "Elisabeth Bennet meets Harry Potter. Well, sort of. I loved, loved, loved this Jane Austen-esque novel that follows the format of letters written between two cousins. Actually, that is how the book was originally written. The two authors adopted the personas and wrote letters to each other, creating the story.Being Jane Austen-esque, it is of course a romance with much attention paid to social etiquettes and proprieties (and improprieties). However, the magic is largely the intrigue that is thrown in.Very fun!

I liked the cover, and the blurb mentioned The Royal College of Wizards, so I ordered it.And did it ever surpass my expectations! Set in Regency England, the book is a comedy of manners, a paranormal fantasy, an epistolary novel, and an absolute delight. I loved it, and I suspect Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer would have loved it, too.Cece and Kate are two cousins who, having gotten into trouble before, are not allowed to have their London seasons together (Aunts Elizabeth and Charlotte are afraid it would be disastrous for all concerned). Therefore, Kate and her younger sister are whisked off to London for their Season, and Cece must wait until the following year for hers.Cece and Kate are reduced to keeping in touch by frequent letters, neither of them happy about their separation. As it turns out, however, Cece's country life becomes more interesting, and Kate in London is about to be entangled in magic. Magic is an accepted part of life (a family acquaintance has just been inducted into The Royal College of Wizards), but the girls have little experience of it as Aunt Elizabeth is adamantly opposed to anything magical. Nevertheless, when Kate inadvertently enters a door into an enchanted garden where a beautiful woman believes Kate is someone else in disguise, magic and sorcery gain access to her life.In the meantime, life in the country gets more interesting when the beautiful young Dorothea arrives and is immediately surrounded by besotted suitors who cannot resist her. Dorothea, a shy young woman, seems almost as bewildered as Cece over the enchanting effect she has over men. Cece befriends Dorothea and has great sympathy for her when Dorothea's stepmother arrives and insists on taking Dorothea to London. Cece is also put out by a young man who has been spying on them.The letters fly back and forth--asking questions and giving advice, describing balls, dresses, and people, and more importantly, trying to solve some mysterious puzzles. Eventually, connections between the small country community of Rushton and the events in London are made, and the intrepid young women take on forces that are threatening and dangerous.What fun! I loved both Cece and Kate and their friendship, high spirits, and satirical comments (oh, the many ways to tie cravats). I loved finding allusions like \"messing about in boats\" and \"ill-met by moonlight,\" references to Walpole, Lady Caroline Lamb and Lord Byron, and the title of the book The Theory and Practice of Charms: Being an Inquiry int the Making of Bags, Boxes, and the Like by Cuntry Witches and Their Ilk. I loved the odious Mysterious Marquis, the magic, and both Cece and Kate.The opening letters are a bit slow, but serve to give an impression, an atmosphere, of the time period; the pace quickly picks up, however, as our undaunted heroines exert their efforts with aplomb and determination.When I finished, I discovered that the process of writing was a game the two authors engaged in. The Letter Game was suggested by Ellen Kushner, another talented writer. A few excerpts from the Afterword:\"The game has no rules, except that the players must never reveal their idea of the plot to one another. It helps to imply in the first letter why the two characters must write to each other and not meet in person.\" (Caroline)\"As the opener of the letter exchange, I was responsible for choosing a setting, as well as for defining my own character. I decided on England just after the Napoleonic Wars, in an alternate universe in which magic really worked....\" (Pat)The authors never discussed the plot with each other; only through the letters of the cousins was information about plot shared. As a result an organic kind of story took form with each author using the letters as key.This novel was great fun to read, and I can only imagine the fun of writing it. Perfect for Carl's Once Upon a Time Challenge.(Attachments by Rainbow Rowell, which I also thoroughly enjoyed, is a form of The Letter Game using emails.)Paranormal Fantasy/Comedy of Manners/Historical Fiction/YA. Kindle ed. 2012.  Print length: 336 pages."}, {"userName": "Jane Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart", "userReview": "Liked the plot. Liked the characters and their capers. But I had a problem with the epistolary method. This could have been a really neat novel if written in the traditional way. As it was, I wanted it to be over.WRITING METHOD:The entire book consists of letters between Cecy and Kate - an epistolary novel. Therefore most things are \u201ctold\u201d not shown, but that is the nature of letters. Each letter has a chatty or gossipy feel talking about clothes, family, friends, and neighbors. The letters also have a diary feel (Aunt wouldn\u2019t let me do something, Mr moved back to town, I went on a picnic with friends and this happened while on the picnic, ...) I was bored during the first 100 pages. It felt like party chit chat. After that, it became more interesting, but my mind frequently wandered. It was hard to stay focused. For most of the book, I was not there - not feeling what was going on. This was probably because of the \u201ctell not show\u201d and maybe due to lack of plot planning. See next paragraph.In the Afterward, the two authors describe how they wrote letters to each other to create the book. Neither one knew the other\u2019s plot until it was done. Then they went back and edited for plot consistency.There was some dialogue in the letters which helped, for example Kate describes her conversation with someone. But other times I wanted more dialogue. For example, when a couple decides to marry she wanted to hear him say I love you. Instead of dialogue we get the following \u201cby the time we were finished kissing, he had said it himself, with considerable feeling. I admit I, too, repeated the words several times. And we agreed that we should, indeed, deal extremely.\u201d Ok, that\u2019s too cerebral for me. I wanted feelings which dialogue might have provided.There were romantic happy endings, but there was no growing of romantic feelings during the book. PLOT:I liked the events. I liked the ordinary world in which some humans had magic abilities. I liked how one character stole/borrowed magic books to study and then secretly put them back later. I liked how the magic worked.CHARACTERS:I liked reading about several characters. I liked watching magic being used in different ways. One character used magic to make her daughter irresistible to all men. Another character used charms to protect her men friends from falling for the daughter.DATA:Narrative mode: 1st person Cecy and Kate. Story length: 316 pages. Swearing language: none.

Mixing genres is always tricky but if one does it well a result can be marvelous. And here we have one of the examples.Imagine:* a sweet Regency romance* two witty and inquisitive young girls, best friends* the world of manners (rules for girls, behaviors and so on)* a subtle magic which exist but doesn't rule the world* and some mystery to solve (which brings danger and shows you who you really are).What you can get from this mixing? I can easy imagine many disasters, failures. But it isn't in this case. Maybe because of the way it was created, in a particular way. Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stevermer made some kind of experiment or fun: the Letter Game (in short, they wrote to each other as invented characters). As a result one of those games they created this novel.I simply love this book. Lighthearted, witty, engaging, lovely, charming, funny.\"My first thought was \u201cEarthquake!\u201d My second, \u201cI will never be able to wear this bonnet again\" ;-)I am not a fan of fantasy but I can appreciate when magic in the book gives it something precious. Magic here is (in my opinion) an instrument to show us something, to make a book a little more interesting too. But it isn't overwhelming. It is just like it should be.[The same beautiful way of using magic I found also in: [book:Chime|8299165],Chime, Shades of Milk and Honey, A Curse Dark as Gold, Ella Enchanted, The Probable Future, The Picture of Dorian Gray, Green Angel. They are different books, some sad, some with happy ending, but all of them are really good].I would like very much to read more such novels.

The authors don't overwrite the magic parts, don't draw unnecessary attention to it to make sure that you're aware that this isn't normal Regency England. They're just added into the story as though it's completely natural for them to be there. This is a major complaint of mine in many books of this style (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, for one, or Soulless), and it was refreshing to see that this novel didn't fall into that same tone. The pure historical fiction parts are also very effortless and enjoyable, so the reader feels that this is a complete world that existed before the authors decided to record it. That's my favorite!

I say \"almost\" because nothing I could write in any universe can possible surpass this, one of my favorite books of all time. I'm not an expert, but I am going to guess that when this book was first published in 1988, it was delightfully unique. Alternate history, with magic, and epistolary fiction on top of that. All of this has been done since, some of this had been done before - but there isn't many books out there that do this so well. I own the original Ace paperback, and was one of the few back in the good old days that was even aware of this book, before it was re-released, before the two (sort of humdrum) sequels. Sorcery is so brilliant, so absolutely gobsmacking brilliant. I devoured this again and again over the years, and it always feels fresh and new each time I re-read it. It's like visiting old friends.
