This is a book from a person with high IQ, likely to be over 120. Here are my reasons: (1)The story unfolds within a period of one year with a large number of charecters playing their role. Frederick Forsyth has shown an unparelleled skill in crafting their roles carefully and the timing for bringing them into the story. (2) His understanding of US, Europe and Middle East is so great that places and cultures fit very well into the story line. (3) The story is not just interaction between humans, but governments, particularly the police and secret services, and writing a story on such a not so known platform neeeds much more than superficial knowledge. Great Work."}, {"userName": "Deepak Eshwar", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12163813-deepak-eshwar", "userReview": "Read it for Quinn the main protagonist.

The US President and Russia\u2019s Gorbachev are about to sign a disarmament treaty that has Military hardliners on both sides angry at loss of funds and material. A US oil Barron who talks to God and gets personal responses has gathered a group of oil men and industrialists, all who stand to loose big money if the treaty goes through, in a plot to get the US President out of office.When the President\u2019s son is kidnapped in England, the White House contacts a retired American who had great success in negotiating hostage releases. Going by the sole name of Quinn, this negotiator reluctantly agrees to help with the recovery, but only if is allowed to do it his way. This is reluctantly agreed to, but certain members of the US task force have doubts and suspicions which at times compromise Quinn\u2019s efforts. This tale ranges from England to the US and Europe in non-stop action.

El mundo pasa por una situaci\u00f3n complicada y los dos l\u00edderes mundiales, presidentes de las dos grandes potencias, apuestan por el desarme y por poner l\u00edmites a los gastos militares entre otras razones porque no hay m\u00e1s dinero\u2026 Son la excusa perfecta para llevarnos a trav\u00e9s de un thriller de ritmo trepidante, algo lento quiz\u00e1s al principio, con su punto culminante en la negociaci\u00f3n para liberar al hijo de presidente de los Estados Unidos y es ah\u00ed donde comienza de verdad la historia, una caza sin cuartel y sin piedad de todos contra todos y donde te puedes encontrar con los amigos m\u00e1s insospechados. Una historia bastante entretenida y recomendable para los amantes de este g\u00e9nero literario.Un peque\u00f1o detalle antes de terminar, la traducci\u00f3n de la historia me pareci\u00f3 bastante floja, curioso como llaman al avi\u00f3n del presidente de los Estados Unidos, el Air Force One\u2026 y adem\u00e1s encontr\u00e9 bastantes erratas a lo largo del texto, algo totalmente incomprensible cuando hay una editorial de prestigio, como se supone, detr\u00e1s.El libro, como dec\u00eda al principio, est\u00e1 comprado en Amazon y voy a contar un peque\u00f1o detalle, otras tiendas y me refiero a Lektu por ejemplo cuando compras un libro digital si este sufre modificaciones por parte de la editorial te hacen llegar un correo avis\u00e1ndote de que puedes descargarte la nueva versi\u00f3n de forma totalmente gratuita como no pod\u00eda ser menos.

Brilliant."}, {"userName": "Benjamin Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4209082-benjamin-thomas", "userReview": "I pulled this one from my book store because I was looking for a Cold War era thriller and have not yet read much from Mr Forsyth. I understand that he does an enormous amount of research for his books and that certainly showed here. This was a well-though out novel and well-structured even though it suffers from amazingly bad publishing timing. It was written in the late 1980s and the traditional Cold War relationship between the US and USSR continues throughout the novel. Of course the author could no more see the incredible events of 1989 (the Wall coming down, the desolution of the Soviet Union, etc.) than the rest of us.I was a little worried as I read the first several chapters as the author spends a lot of time building the background for the story. We get a lot of back story on numerous characters, including high ranking politicians in both countries as well as businessmen, Senators, etc. but it was unclear just who the POV character would be. It isn't until around page 100 or so that we meet Quinn, the Negotiator himself and the novel settles down into a nice coherent plot. On the surface, the story centers around the kidnapping of the US president's only son but there is so much going on here that it is not at all predictable. Very enjoyable and now, of course, I want to read more from this author, especially his more famous works such as \"Day of the Jackal\"."}, {"userName": "Jim Puskas", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7429967-jim-puskas", "userReview": "Quinn is much more than a negotiator: he's also a highly trained and experienced commando, typical of Forsyth's central characters. Of course, in a Forsyth novel things are never quite what they seem; we're never quite sure who can be trusted and who the traitors are. As usual, Forsyth introduces a large cast of characters, whose lives intersect in complex ways.One minor quibble: Forsyth's research, usually impeccable, is a bit suspect in his depiction of winter in the hill country of Vermont as extremely frigid, almost od arctic proportions; setting that episode in North Dakota would have made more sense. But in most respects this is a typical Forsyth adventure, complete with incompetent FBI agents, scoundrelly politicians, evil, sadistic villains and KGB operatives who can work both sides of the street when it suits their purposes.Not up to Forsyth's best such as The Devil's Alternative etc. but a very engaging read."}, {"userName": "Stefan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/851219-stefan", "userReview": "The first two chapters of The Negotiator were very slow and uninteresting and I feared that this would be a tedious read. Fortunately, the pace began to pick up and I became immersed in the story. The plot contains several sub-plots (all of which are satisfactorily wrapped up in the conclusion), a number of interesting characters (notably the protagonist, Quinn), a number of neat settings (Vermont, Washington D.C., Corsica, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Russia, Texas, and others, all of which are described in vivid detail), and dialogue which was superbly crafted.
