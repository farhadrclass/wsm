This is a family trait that passes down through the bloodlines but is not present in every generation. Her 16th birthday marks when her powers begin in earnest, and from that day on she and her loved ones are in danger from the Aternocti, beings who want to pass the soul onto Hell, and destroy the Fenestra's. The characters in this book were all fairly two dimensional but still highly enjoyable. Meridian spends most of the book in confusion and fear (understandable since she never understood what she was and is being hunted). Her life growing up was hard on her, she had no friends, people thought she was some kind of witch as animals and insects were always dying around her. She thinks she is the cause of the deaths and that people should fear her. So she never seeks out friends or love and accepts that those things are just not for her. I thought she should have asked more questions about all of this, but was always just completely accepting. Meridian was allowed to begin the book as a scared child and then grow into strong willed young woman. Tens, her Protector and love interest, is loyal, brave, and consistently trying to help her. Their relationship is totally rushed and not fleshed out since it was expected by one due to his gifts and completely overwhelmed the other who was always alone and felt unworthy of love. And again you have a YA book where the characters are 16 and 18, but are pure with no real urges or interludes between them. Auntie was by far the best character in the book. The woman was 106 years old!! Yet still a fighter, a teacher, and a protector. She was strong, sweet, and wise. Every scene she was in had much deeper emotions and was just more memorable. At only 300 pages the author could have written more to flesh out the main characters a bit more, but really I didn't think that it detracted from the story too much. A fair warning...the main villain passes himself off as a evangelist preacher who consistently quotes the most violent and intolerable passages from the Bible. He uses Christianity as a weapon to ostracize 'non-believers' (i.e. people who weren't fanatic enough), condemn harassment and vandalism, and allow the deaths of innocent children. The quotes from the Bible are marked and identified at the back of the book, and are used to justify his evil actions. I say this as a warning because I could see people being offended by the radical portrayal of the religion in this book. The crazy fanaticism was even uncomfortable to read at times as I wanted to slap people senseless to shock them awake and realize the consequences of their actions. I wasn't offended or anything but it was shocking to read as I could seriously see this happening, which was especially terrifying.The climax could have also been elaborated on a bit. It wasn't that it was anti-climactic but it could have been much more dramatic. It was as if it was almost too easy on the heroine. She has to makes some insane choices but there isn't much action. Not to mention how things *mysteriously* got fixed with no explanation. I also loved the inclusion of quilting (being a quilter myself) as a theme representing the soul's lives. Auntie would make quilts to represent the people she helped cross, and it was her outlet for dealing with the consequences of helping them. There was one passage I particularly liked and want to share. \"Each stitch was a heartbeat, a breath; each seam an experience, a lesson learned. Each piece of fabric was a feeling, a like, a dislike, a pain, happiness. Combined, they build a life, a picture of a life anyway, in bits and pieces. Like memories, they have no linear logic, but they resonate. You can tell a lot about a person by the quilt Auntie made for them after they died.\"Overall, the take on death was original, dark, and well thought out. All the emotions and fears that surround death were brought up, discussed, examined, and left for the reader to make their own personal conclusions about. I was definitely pleasantly surprised that it was so good after all the YA dribble I have read lately. Just goes to show you to ignore marketing as the mass marketed books like Fallen, Shiver, and Hush, Hush were so bad, yet the unknown books like this one and The Splendor Falls was wonderful.Something odd about the cover of the book released in Turkey Amy Lee from Evanescence as the cover model! Weird!*********Here's the prologue from the book. From the first sentence onwards I was completely hooked. \nPrologue\nThe first creatures to seek me were the insects; my parents cleaned the bassinet free of dead ants the morning after they brought me home from the hospital. My first word was \u201cdead.\u201dAt age four, when I stepped out of bed and popped a giant toad like a water balloon, I never again turned any lights off.For all of my sixth year, I slept sitting up thinking I\u2019d spot the dying coming toward me.There were times when it felt like my insides were full of broken glass, times when the souls of the animals passing through me felt too big, too much. I\u2019d open my eyes in the morning and peer into the glassy gaze of a mouse on my pillow. Death never became my comfortable companion.I didn\u2019t have nightmares about monsters; I wasn\u2019t afraid of a thing in my closet. In fact, there were many times when I wished they, the dying, would hide under my bed instead of burrowing into the pile of stuffed animals by my head.My mother hugged me, told me I was special. I\u2019d like to think my parents weren\u2019t revolted by me. But I\u2019ll never forget the feelings apparent in the glances they exchanged over my head. Worry. Fear. Repulsion. Concern.My first chore was to clean up the carcasses. My second was to make the bed. I\u2019d don rubber gloves and pick the dead up. My hands grew callused from digging so many graves. We ran out of room in the backyard by my fourteenth birthday. When I was too ill to do it, my dad stepped in and removed them, but it was always with thinly veiled disgust.I trembled my way through the days, constantly sleep deprived, chronically ill. My stomach always hurt. Low-grade headaches constantly thumped a slow tempo. Doctors labeled me a hypochondriac, or worse\u2014still they never found causes for the symptoms. The pain was real. The cause a mystery. They suggested shrinks. Growing pains. Perhaps I was one of those children who required lots of attention. I\u2019d catch my mom staring at me\u2014she often started conversations, only to break off and leave the room.With each moon phase, the animals got bigger. Soon, they came during the day as well. At school, kids whispered my nicknames: Reaper, Grave Digger, Witch. Others, I pretended not to hear. Adults ostracized me, too. It hurt.As I got older and stopped trying to bond, I came to the same conclusion as everyone else. I was weird. A freak. A sideshow act.When my brother Sam was born, I kept a vigil in his room. Intent on cleaning up the dead things before he woke. I focused on making him feel that he wasn\u2019t alone, that I understood how scary this world could be. I wouldn\u2019t let him suffer my fears; he\u2019d be normal in my eyes. By the time he was a month-old and the only dead came near him because of me, I retreated.My parents pretended it didn\u2019t matter. That nothing ever died around me. That our backyard wasn\u2019t a graveyard. If anything, they acted like I had a talent. A gift.If we had an extended family, I didn\u2019t know them. The only exception was my namesake, a great-Aunt who sent me birthday quilts once a year. My world was, and is, me and death. It\u2019s a lonely place to live, but I thought things were getting better. My name is Meridian Sozu, and I was wrong.*****You can read the first couple of chapters here."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1594906-kim", "userReview": "I'm frowning... I liked about 3/4 of this book. Towards the end it all went way too fast and everything just... worked out somehow. They needed person A and poof there he was. Then they needed person B and lucky for Meridian the mother of person B already had a dream about Meridian needing their help, so they were already near where it all went down. But not without the help of a tame wolf who decided playing dead on the middle of a deserted road was the best approach to making them stop their car (is that dog insane? Put somebody like me behind the wheel and I'd probably would have ran over the poor animal because I didn't see it) so she could lead them to where Meridian was waiting. Convenient, no? If this is confusing, wait 'till you read the book.I also don't know what point the author was trying to make when writing the train wreck scene. Yes a disaster like that is horrible. No it's not pretty, people are hurt/dying/dead. But do I really need to read about what a mix of blood, urine and *shivers* human waste smells like? What it feels like on your skin?

Her family is of no help at all, I mean like the least useful people ever. If your daughter was a foreordained Fenestra/window of death thingy with people coming after her and trying to kill her when she comes into her full powers, WOULDN'T YOU WANT HER TO KNOW ABOUT IT? No! Hell to the no. They stick their heads in the sand like a couple of ostriches; being raised by animals who eat their young would probably give Meridian a better survival rate, actually.The loving parents 1) act like they're disgusted of Meridian because she attracts dead things, 2) give her no clue as to what she is so she at least knows what she's facing, 3) give her no survival skills whatsoever so she can fight back, 4) literally toss her onto a bus with no idea where she's going when people are trying to kill her.The loving aunt is not much better. For someone who needs a successor, she didn't really do much to help Meridian survive. That scene where Meridian's abandoned at the bus stop? She is a braver girl than I. If I were left in a foreign place, in the middle of a snowstorm, tossed out by my parents, not picked up by an aunt whom I hardly knew existed, I'd be a sniveling, crying mess. When they finally meet, Auntie is horrified at the lack of information Meridian's parents gave her. Um, HELLO? For 16 years, all you did was send her quilts, lady. Was a visit too much to ask?/takes deep breathThe plot was very Christian-centric. I get that it's not trying to be preachy, and this was, after all, an angel-based story, but I didn't really like the evil guys being Christian evangelists, and the accident on the train was a bit overreaching. The plot was a bit of a mess, they talk to people, they get preachy, they meet neighbors, they save people, it didn't feel like there was much centralization to the plot. I didn't like Tens either (what the hell kind of a name is that, anyway? This is an YA fantasy book, give me a sexy name! I don't need to learn to count). He comes off as completely patronizing and rude to Meridian when she first arrived in Colorado; considering that he's supposed to be her protector, he could have been a leetle bit nicer and less of a douche.Meridian herself is the victim of the people around her, her parents, aunt, Tens, they've all resulted in her being a weak, scared little girl. Not that I blame her, I'd be worse in her case, but the book did not set her up to be a very good main character, and I find that I didn't care much for her at all. Man, this was a hard book to finish."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1994948-karen", "userReview": "I had the good fortune to win an ARC of MERIDIAN from someone who snagged it at the ALA Midwinter conference. I read the book in nibbles and gulps, both wanting to savor it and make it last. MERIDIAN is the kind of book that my mind kept drifting to when I was trying to concentrate, or even when I was just shopping at the grocery store. The best parts, for me: The character of Meridian, who manages to be both strong and vulnerable, mature and believably sixteen. Kizer pulls this off with Meridian's voice, I think, which reminded me a little of myself at that age. I really like how she explores her powers and the idea of death; Kizer handles these scenes with subtle, nuanced emotion, where a lesser author might stray into the melodramatic. Meridian's protector and love (as described in the blurb), Tens, came across refreshingly charming and flawed in the face of a slew of drop-dead gorgeous, brooding, and otherwise cardboard males in other young adult fantasy. Yes, he's mysterious, but not annoyingly so. The weakest parts: At times I felt like the antagonist was just stuck in there to provide tension and didn't really have a good reason to show up so often. Even though the antagonist has a motive, it wasn't one I felt at a gut level. The ending, consequently, seemed somewhat flat, and also felt like a set up for a sequel. Also, the pacing felt a little uneven in the last half of the book; I wondered if these scenes were written more hastily than the earlier ones.Overall, I found MERIDIAN to be deliciously different, not even bothering to tread into the realm of cliches, with great characters I could sympathize with and imagine outside of the book. I suspect MERIDIAN will be quite popular when it comes out in August 2009. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2366564-trish", "userReview": "I'm not going to re-cap the events of the book, everybody else has already done it. Let me start off by saying this wasn't a bad book. I thought the premise was original and very interesting.My problem was that I never actually connected to it and I'm not sure why. It felt like I was listening to the story, but not LIVING IN the story (if that makes sense). My favorite books are the ones that I fall completely into, where the world of the story becomes MY world while I'm reading, and this one just never sucked me in like that.I also didn't 'feel' the connection between Meridian and Tens, I didn't feel any attraction between them at all, it felt like they'd just decided to go ahead and be together since they'd been told they were supposed to, not because there was any overwhelming compulsion or attraction between them.Also, while I understand religious fanaticism exists in abundance, I had a hard time with the ENTIRE town completely under Perimo's black thumb. Esp. with women and babies dying, pregnant women being forced to eat only bread and water and NOBODY in their right mind questioning it?

It ended to easily making it too neat and tidy that left me wanting more and less. The story itself wasn't evenly paced and while I have to applauded the originality of this concept since I thought it was a cool twist to Angels and I found it fascinating and interesting to learn about Fenestra, but unfortunately this was another book that didn't live up to it's full potential and I ended up skimming to just finish it.What could have been great was instead just an okay read."}, {"userName": "Misty", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124284-misty", "userReview": "3.75I have been wanting to read this book for awhile because it has one of my absolute favorite opening sections ever (which I did read. A few times. But never the whole book), but I was saving it to read with my book club, since I knew it was on the schedule. We finally read it for last month's meeting, so now I can share it with you for Helluva Halloween. I want to start by saying that all in all, I would recommend this, I did like it, but.But I felt like it let me down a little. Maybe it was because I loved the prologue so much. Maybe it was because I had been building it up in my head for months and months. And it's never that it was really bad, don't get me wrong. But though I liked it as a whole, there were a few things I couldn't get past.Here's the breakdown:Meridian had an original feel. It was interesting, because I think it did follow a formula we're all familiar with in YA. There was a predictability, so much so that there were things you could see coming through the entire book, and you begin to wonder why none of the characters see it. The villain is so obvious the entire time that it becomes on of those irritating things that makes you say: how do you not see this? That's a little frustrating. (The good guys were really obvious, too, and you can always tell who's going to be coming back into the story to save the day.) But in spite of this, there is still a feeling of freshness about the work. Kizer's fenestra mythology is interesting and new, and the issues that it raises and is bound to cause for Meridian add noticeably to the story. The religious zealotry in the story, though admittedly over the top, was also an interesting aspect. At least for me, as there's little that freaks me out more.And even though the bad guys and good guys may as well come with big declarative flags over their heads, they're still interesting. I genuinely liked Meridian, Auntie and Tens (especially Tens), and wanted more of their backstories (again, especially Tens). I thought some good groundwork was laid for the future of the series with the little snippets of information that we did get, but at the same time, it was frustrating. Don't just give me good groundwork for future books -- give me a good book now. Make me want to read your future books on the writing alone, not a hook, or a plot line I want to see finished.Which brings me to the most irritating part of the book (other than the obviousness that wasn't obvious to anyone) -- the ending. I've said it before, I'll say it again, I am not a fan of deus ex machina. At all. The end of this was a disappointment for me on a few levels. It was just all too convenient, every last detail. And so, so quick. Blink and you missed it. I want some meat to it. What happened? Break it down, drag it out a bit, give me something to chew on and savor. This was the biggest point of contention for my book club, actually. I think we all felt a little cheated, like we'd been given the brush off.But in spite of this, most of us still said we liked the book, me more so than many. (Two haaated it) It was engaging, and what wasn't fulfilling I could supplement with my mind. (<-- I don't think a book should make you do that, but at least it means there was something there to work with.) And like I said, it managed to somehow be fresh, and there were some issues raised that I hope to see (and should certainly be) in book 2. It felt like Kizer has yet to hit her stride, but that when she does she'll be an author to watch."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10688316-courtney", "userReview": "Meridian was... not bad.It's not something I got really into - not one of those books you just can't put down, or anything like that. It was a good book, though. Meridian just turned 16, and has spent her whole life haunted by death. Every morning since her birth, she's woken up to find the bodies of animals surrounding her, with no explanation as to why. And things are steadily getting worse. On the day she turns 16 she returns home from school to find her family has suddenly packed up the house and all their belongings in preparation to move, a decision apparently made out of the blue. And Meridian will not be going with them.Instead she's sent to the home of her (Great) Aunt in Colorado (?), to learn how to control the powers that draw the dying to her before the dark forces who are hunting her manage to track her down. Her aunts home is not as safe as it seems, however, as an extremist cult has settled into the area, and the leader has made Meridians' aunt into a target. The good: Interesting plot, likeable characters, main (female) character isn't completely helpless and doesn't act like a damsel in distress. And despite wanting nothing to do with her powers, she is willing to step up and learn what she has to instead of whining about it and fighting it at every turn. There is a - cliche - romance plot, but the character is capable of thinking of things other than romance. The story about the aunts' romantic past was one that I did like, though - I thought it was very sweet, and far more believable than the main one. If Kizer ever decides to write that story as a novel, I'd definitely love to check it out. The bad: A lot of it was very predictable - I guess the author was trying to drop subtle clues to readers, but it was more like an anvil dropping on your head. I knew after about a chapter of her Aunts' explanations what was upcoming in regards to the big bad.There is the usual cliche romance, which progresses way too fast. Or seems to, at least - the story seems like it takes place over a matter of days - 3 weeks at the most, and that's probably be stretching it. Destined romance or not, I find it a bit of a stretch to believe that you can fall into love with someone that fast, especially when you don't know them very well.Also? At one point we have a character show up who plays a major part in the story, and it's his second appearance. The thing is it's unlikely you'll realize this - the character shows up for about 3 pages near the start of the book, and is only named once. We don't see them again, they aren't mentioned again, but despite this Meridian instantly recognizes him when he appears, knowing exactly who he is. Meridian must be a freaking genius for names & faces, because I sure as heck didn't remember him. [I can't even remember people I've met more than once in real life half the time, if they're not people I actually talk to and see occasionally. A stranger I meet once in passing? Not happening.]Overall, it was a good read. It was interesting, and I'll probably check out the rest of the series to see what happens unless the writing takes a major header.

Nocti transport souls to hell. If neither a Fenestra nor a Nocti are around when a person dies, the person reincarnates. The heaven/hell/reincarnation thing is pure chance, depending on proximity and timing. Kizer references Einstein and talks about energy transforming and rising--presumably the soul. Yet for a set-up that removes all morality, the actual conflict is pure good vs. evil, or rather Creator vs. Destroyer. Meridian is practically a blank slate, having no friends, no hobbies, no dreams, no drive. She doesn't like that things die around her all the time and that she constantly feels sick, but even that isn't described vividly enough to be compelling. Tens is a tall, dark, handsome, project-your-own-fantasy-here cutout figure. They fall in love because they're destined to be together. Similarly, there's no suspense to the plot because it's never really in question that Meridian will come to accept and master her powers.

I didn't expect it to turn around into some long, drawn out boring, dull romance (if you can even call it that).The entire beginning was too buoyant--very very slow then sped up too quickly--not enough time to develop any characterization. You are barely figuring out how Meridian feels about who she is and suddenly, oh someone's after her, quick get her to auntie's house, boom, she's at aunties house with a handsome boy all at the same time! Then the middle became too drawn out and nothing happened. Nothing, seriously.I felt like the story never connected with me. I had no admiration for the characters because they were so dull to begin with. After going 31% through the book, I felt myself not wanting to go on because of all the drab slow-pacing flow of the story. It wasn't going anywhere in all honesty. Meridian and Tens had no chemistry at all and I found their romance uninteresting to follow. There was a lot of unnecessary religious glorification in the book that I found unbearable to read.It took me a while to finish.

I enjoyed learning about the Fenestras and the way they helped souls reach eternal peace, but unfortunately poor execution and choppy writing hampered the story for me.Meridian is a character with whom she can sympathize. She has been wrenched suddenly from the only life she has known (even though it has been a terribly lonely one), only to find herself with the burden of ancient responsibilities, with hundreds of people bent on intending her harm. The way she reacts to her situation is consistent and plausible, and yet she is able to work that female power in a very heroine-saves-the-day way.Unfortunately, I felt for the most part disconnected from the story, due to its choppy narration. The concept of Fenestras was a big one to tackle in a couple hundred pages, and I would\u2019ve liked more flow and time spent on clearer explanations, instead of forced, mysterious, and confusing conversations. In the end, I felt like I didn\u2019t connect to any of the characters, and was unimpressed with the development of Meridian and Tens\u2019 romance.Overall, MERIDIAN is a unique story that, despite some flaws, will appeal to readers looking for an easy paranormal read."}, {"userName": "Peace Love and Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1963075-peace-love-and-reviews", "userReview": "At this rate anything about Angels are intriguing to me. So I was really excited to read Meridian. So I was really sad that most parts of this book is not as exciting as I thought. The first chapters were catchy. It gives you this detailed picture that she was being surrounded by death. Like literally, she was never normal, never got the chance to be one. Everytime she wakes up in the morning there are death insect / animals around her. It was a little traumatic yet she came out as this kind hearted young girl and I love her for that. There's something about her makes her special. But I still could not put my finger on what it was. Then the day of her 16th birthday arrived. First her mother freaked when about some call they got that day. She got fierce hugs and just this weird feeling. the school day ended and she got off the bus, then all of a sudden this SUV headed out for her, killing a bunch of people in the process. She parents then told her that she needs to leave town and that they love them no matter what. It was all to fast and too discombobulating. It was a bunch of questions,a really good way to start a story. But it continued on to the next chapters. Somewhere along the way it became tedious and a bit boring.The history on what she is, which is a Fenestra - an angel who serves as a window to the souls getting to that next level on their path to heaven. The ancient malevolent creatures who seek to destroy them - which is called the Nocti, has a very very good concept. What really kept me going was this poser priest named Perimo, he made me so mad, I was so eager to find out what his fate will be at the end. And I like how he ended.

I dont really want to say too much about it because it is an unusual gift that Meridian has and for the 1st 16 years of her life wasnt aware of in the right way. When her life is put into danger she is separated from all she has ever knew and made to go stay with her Aunt and her helper Tens who then put her on a crash course to master her gift before time runs out. All the main charcters are likable, Meridian is a 16 year old girl who hasnt really fit in anywhere and known as a 'freak' from her peers and kept at arms length by her parents. Her Aunt also named Meridian is a lovely all knowing Grandmotherly type with a lot of wisdom to pass on and Tens, hmm we dont really get a lot of his back story but im sure that will come in the sequel, he was irritating a bit in the beginning but then as he and Meridian warmed to each other he warmed to me also and they are so sweet together. I feel that the aunt took most of the dialogue and i wanted more of Tens and Meridian together but im willing to wait :)The plot with the enemy wasnt huge, smalltown religious zealots causing witch hunts whilst hiding beneath the guise of all thats holy, while good people are persecuted and driven from their homes. Grrr i dont do religious fanatics !! but its left me thinking it will still be causing her some trouble throughout the series and this is a good start.

On her sixteenth birthday when she witnesses a tragic car accident right in front of her house, her parents proceed to tell her that she must leave town immediately to stay with her great-aunt in Colorado. And\u2026 that\u2019s about where it went downhill and into predictable-YA land for me.Now don\u2019t get me wrong, this is an extremely interesting story and I was extremely interested in learning all about \u2018Fenestra\u2019s\u2019 and I loved how even though the story obviously has to do with angels it didn\u2019t go overtly religious and the author had the decency to not associate angels strictly with Christianity. The main problem I had was the main character was your typical annoying and immature YA character; she pretty much drove me crazy. The other problem I had was even as interesting as the story was to me, the actual writing kind of fell flat for me, was a bit choppy, and overall predictable. The fact that I enjoyed it as much as I did regardless of the problems I had with it I would still be interested in picking up the next in this series to see where the author continues to take this story.Interested in more of my reviews?

I put it on my to reads book list with no real intention to seek it out but when I saw it in the shops something possessed me to buy it and boy am I glad.This book had me gripped from the first page, I hate books with boring starts because I automatically get tired of the main character, I know that sounds stupid but it\u2019s true. This book made its statement from page one and I can\u2019t recall a boring moment in the book although I didn\u2019t exactly like the letters and journal entries but that\u2019s just me.The plot to \u201cMeridian\u201d was really quite wonderious, the concept that the author created of dying was really interesting and I found myself fascinated with the idea of a window to heaven. The characters in this book were good as well Ten\u2019s was alright although I thought he could have been a bit better, Auntie was my favourite, and I was so sad when the end came for her. Meridian\u2019s character I really liked and I found myself empathising with her decisions.The writing style was good as well, I liked how it didn\u2019t ramble and do flash backs I don\u2019t really like it when authors do that! The book was also really easy to read and understand, it flowed and that was nice.This was a great book. I never got bored and always wanted to know more.

They were all well developed and a pleasure to read about. Each contributed to the novel in a different way. The main character, Meridian, had to be my favorite of them all. She was relatable and definitely had my sympathy when she was forced to leave her family behind. She was also strong-willed and a great listener. Tens was fantastic too! He was sarcastic--which I love--and hilarious, which is good too. He was almost the exact opposite of Meridian and they balanced each other out perfectly. The romance between the two was refreshing.The novel was surprisingly fast-paced and the plot was just genius. I thought the duty of a Fenestra was awesome--helping the dead move on to Heaven. It sounded like a cool job, but kind of scary.One thing I found distasteful was the lack of explanation in some parts. I found myself confused every once once in a while. Another thing was that I actually got bored. Even though that was a rarity, it was still present, and it lessened my interest in the novel.Meridian was an exciting read and kept me on my toes for the majority of the time.

For the first sixteen years of her life no one told her any different. Sure, she wasn\u2019t exactly normal by anyone\u2019s standards, even her own, but she certainly didn\u2019t think she wasn\u2019t human.All of her life, living creatures would just come up to her and die. If this freaked her out, how could she expect anyone else not to think of her as a freak and an outcast? I mean, who wants to be friends with someone that may just be walking death?There was also the problem with photos. There was not one single picture of her. Every time anyone tried to take a photo of her, there was this blinding light that would distort the image.But on her sixteenth birthday everything changed. In the course of one day, she went from having a home and a family, to being rushed out of town while her family packed up and moved away to an undisclosed location.She was told it was for her safety and theirs that she go and stay with her Aunt Merry in Revelation, Colorado, that she is something other and that now that she\u2019s sixteen she is in danger.Finding this out while being rushed to the bus station with some cash and a few changes of clothing is not in the least bit comforting. And being provided with only the sketchiest of details only makes matters worse. What exactly does it mean to be a Fenestra? Who is she in danger from? And why now?Running to an Aunt that she barely knows aside from a yearly quilt she receives is probably one of the most frightening things that has happened to Meridian, but what awaits her in Colorado is much worse.***Meridian is the first book in a new series by Amber Kizer. It brings to the young adult market a new spin on the angels theme. Meridian Sozu is a half-angel, half-human whose purpose is to help souls pass from this world into the afterlife. There are also beings, the Alternocti or Nocti, who seek to lead souls away from the light and into the dark. These Destroyers also hope to turn the Fenestra toward their side to tip the balance in their favor.With the help of her Protector, Tens, and the guidance of her aunt, Meridian will need to quickly learn how to master this process before it kills her or before the Nocti can destroy her.Meridian is an utterly captivating story. The author does a beautiful job of developing Meridian Sozu\u2019s character from frail and confused to strong and focused, ready to accept the awesome responsibility she has been given and the good that she can provide to others at a most frightening time.I\u2019m eclipsed by my role in the world.Author Amber Kizer gives readers insight into the Fenestra history by creatively weaving in journal entries at the beginning of several chapters in the story from other Fenestra as well as Meridian\u2019s aunt.The story will keep you engaged from the moment Meridian is abruptly whisked off to join her aunt in Colorado until the story\u2019s climactic ending.Although it is not a cliffhanger, the novel sets the stage, with an almost prequel-like feel, for many possible adventures to come in Meridian\u2019s quest to maintain the balance between light and dark.On a personal note:I. Loved. This. Book.Although it fits right in with other books in this genre, the concept of the Fenestra makes this remarkably different. The idea of beings who act as windows to help souls transition from this life is something I haven\u2019t seen in any of the YA books I\u2019ve read.When I first started to read this book I did notice some similarities in the setting that made it, at first glance, blend in with the Need series. A girl leaves her family to stay with an aunt she doesn\u2019t know very well, in a remote, wooded and wintry locale. There is a also wolf. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.I loved all the characters, especially Auntie Merry who was one totally awesome one hundred and six-year-old woman and Custos the wolf who immediately befriended Meridian. Meridian was a strong and sympathetic character and Tens was the perfect protector. And the baddie in this story was most definitely detestable.And yes, I know,it\u2019s geeky, but I loved the element of the one sixes \u2013 Meridian was sixteen (16), January 6 was a key date (1/6), and Auntie Merry was one hundred and six (106).No, I did not sob my way through this book, but there may have been a tear or two. And I was completely rooting for Tens and Meridian as a couple.There was no question I was going to re-read this book and I will most likely read it again before Wildcat Fireflies."}, {"userName": "Yan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1350957-yan", "userReview": "Summary: Tired of reading about faeries? Well how about reading about angels? \"Sixteen-year-old Meridian has been surrounded by death ever since she can remember. As a child, insects, mice, and salamanders would burrow into her bedclothes and die. At her elementary school, she was blamed for a classmate's tragic accident. And on her sixteenth birthday, a car crashes in front of her family home\u2014and Meridian's body explodes in pain.Before she can fully recover, Meridian is told that she's a danger to her family and rushed off to her great-aunt's house in Revelation, Colorado. It's there that she learns that she is a Fenestra\u2014the half-angel, half-human link between the living and the dead. But Meridian and her sworn protector and love, Tens, face great danger from the Aternocti, a band of dark forces who capture vulnerable souls on the brink of death and cause chaos.\"Review: I thought the development of Meridian\u2019s power was great\u2014taking baby steps. Some of the novels I have read show the character going from completely oblivious to this sudden surge of control and knowledge; not here though! This book gives off a much more realistic approach.The relationship with the characters was also well done. I enjoyed reading the small scenes between the characters and the dialogue between them. Within these dialogues, background information was given. If you know me, I greatly appreciate it when an author gives background information. She gives you enough about the supernatural world for readers to understand but not too much to completely ruin the enjoyment of the story. In addition, small bits of character backgrounds are given. This gives the reader a much better feel and care for the characters, as well as the reasons behind their motives and actions. Some parts to me were too predictable though. It felt that the suspense and ambiguity factor that the book tried to create\u2026lacked, in a word. Many of the scenes I could have predicted in the very beginning\u2014of course, the author did leave major hints behind, but it bores the readers to know the outcome of almost the entire storyline.There were also some sections in the book that had me scratching my head. Where did this character pop up from? What just happened? And the ending was just one giant blur to me\u2014 maybe I just did not read it carefully enough? One of my major issues has to be when Meridian actually got in a car with a stranger. Granted it was a taxi driver, but it definitely irked me that she can be so careless of herself. Every now and then there would be awkward moments where I just wanted to shout \"What!?\" In that sense, I was not confused but rather flabbergasted; \"Where in the world did this come from!?\" It all comes together in the end but, even after, I still cannot wrap my head around it. It can be easily interpreted as a scapegoat to create a forced happy ending. I am still very much peeved about this to this point.Overall: A very nice book if you're bored; a good book overall, but nothing too spectacular. Still, definitely an enjoyable read if you're sick of faeries and want to try a different supernatural being."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15877683-patricia", "userReview": "Meine MeinungSchon seit ihrer Geburt wird Meridian von Tod und Trauer verfolgt. Jeden Morgen wacht sie umgeben von toten Tieren auf und der Garten ihres Elternhauses gleicht einem Friedhof. Nat\u00fcrlich hat Meridian keine Freunde, den wer will schon mit jemanden befreundet sein, der so offensichtlich den Tod mit sich bringt?Als Meridian 16 Jahre alt wird, beobachtet sie auf dem Nachhauseweg einen Autounfall. Ihre Eltern dr\u00fccken ihre gerade noch so einen fertig gepackten Rucksack in die Hand und schicken sie zu ihrer Gro\u00dftante. Dort angekommen lernt sie nicht nur Tens, ihren W\u00e4chter, kennen, sondern sie kommt auch hinter das Geheimnis ihrer Gabe. Meridian ist eine Fenestra, sie hat die Gabe sterbenden Gesch\u00f6pfen ein Fenster in den Himmel zu \u00f6ffnen. Meridian lehnt ihre Gabe zun\u00e4chst ab, da sie den Tod nicht begr\u00fc\u00dfen, sondern bek\u00e4mpfen will. Allerdings muss sie schnell lernen mit ihren F\u00e4higkeiten umzugehen, denn wenn es Wesen gibt, die ein Fenster in den Himmel \u00f6ffnen k\u00f6nnen, gibt es nat\u00fcrlich aus das gleiche f\u00fcr die H\u00f6lle und beide Seiten stehen sich im immerw\u00e4hrenden Krieg gegen\u00fcber.Die Geschichte ist ungew\u00f6hnlich. Sie besch\u00e4ftigt sich mit Tod und Trauer und der Nat\u00fcrlichkeit dieses Prozesses. Meridian, die in dem Buch als Ich-Erz\u00e4hlerin dient, kann ihre Gabe nur schwer annehmen, da der Tod sie abst\u00f6\u00dft. Kein Wunder, niemand hat es f\u00fcr n\u00f6tig gehalten sie \u00fcber ihre Gabe aufzukl\u00e4ren und so sieht sie sich selbst als Todesengel. Bei ihrer Gro\u00dftante lernt sie jetzt im Schnelldurchlauf ihre F\u00e4higkeiten kennen und wird noch dazu vom Feind bedroht. Dabei ist das Thema Tod gut f\u00fcr Jugendliche aufgearbeitet und verst\u00e4ndlich ohne moralischen D\u00fcnkel dargelegt.Die Sprache in dem Buch ist einfach und jugendgerecht gehalten. Leider haben sich hier und da ein paar Logikfehler in den Text eingeschlichen, die den Lesefluss erheblich st\u00f6ren. So wird Meridian in ein schreckliches Ereigniss verwickelt und beendet den Tag v\u00f6llig ersch\u00f6pft damit, dass ihr W\u00e4chter sie abduscht. Das n\u00e4chste Kapitel beginnt damit, dass sie die Ger\u00fcche des Vortages noch an ihr haften, weil sie es nicht geschafft zu duschen. Solche Ungereihmtheiten treten im Verlauf des Buch des\u00f6fteren auf.Die Charaktere bis auf Meridian blieben leider etwas flach f\u00fcr mich. Besonders ihren Gegenspieler h\u00e4tte ich etwas mehr Tiefe, ja ein bisschen mehr Boshaftigkeit gew\u00fcnscht, damit mich die Geschichte auch gef\u00fchlsm\u00e4\u00dfig abholt. Durch die fehlende Ausarbeitung der Nebendarsteller, bleibt auch die Liebesgeschichte f\u00fcr mich oberfl\u00e4chlich und konnte mich emotional nicht packen.Fazit: Meridian ist ein Buch mit einer faszienierenden Idee. Das Thema Tod wird hier aufgegriffen und von vielen Seiten beleuchtet, so dass insbesondere junge Leser den ein oder anderen hilfreichen Gedanken werden mitnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Leider strotz das Buch vor Logikfehlern und auch die Charaktere sind nicht gerade ausgearbeitet. Das Ende des Buches kam mit gro\u00dfen Knalleffekt daher und wirkte ebenfalls etwas aufgesetzt. Insgesamt gebe ich dem Buch drei Sterne."}, {"userName": "Nicola Mansfield", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1682713-nicola-mansfield", "userReview": "Reason for Reading: I was attracted to the angel aspect of the story as I enjoy paranormals involving angels.When Meridian turns sixteen her family has planned for her to be whisked away to live with \"Auntie\" for an undermined amount of time. It is here that she learns that she is only half-human, the other half is angel. In fact she is a Fenestra, a window to the 'other side' that the dead seek out, if she is near, to make their passing easier. Auntie is also a Fenestra and Meridian has been brought here to learn how to open and close the window properly without getting sucked in herself. But time is short and their evil opponents, the Aternocti will do anything to destroy Auntie and Fenestra before the information can be passed on.The premise of this story is very exciting and I feel the book could have been so much more than it was. The only character I really connected with Meridian herself, even though there were plenty of times when her behaviour didn't quite ring true. I'm of two minds when it comes to this book. I feel as though my words will make the book sound worse than it was because I really did enjoy the story, became quite caught up in the plot and read the book quickly.Besides the lack of fully developed characters my main irritant with the book were the religious issues. The author went to great pains to repeatedly let Meridian know that in (the book's) world their is no Christianity. Meridian would ask questions about Heaven and would be given answers like religions have many names for it. She'd ask about God and be told \"the Creators are known by many names\". This type of thing is mentioned so much you are hit over the head with it. And yet, the bad guys are masquerading as Christians. We are told once at the beginning of the book, before we meet the bad guys, that they are a cult, after that they are simply referred to as Christians. However, throughout the entire book all the detailed descriptions of this group, their practices and church celebrations are all based on The Old Testament. The self-styled preacher quotes Biblical phrases often and there are notes for the reader to look them up (all Old Testament). There is no mention of Jesus or Christ, except once when someone mentions they voted to keep the Christ in Christmas. This just really irked me. The two issues together come across as being anti-Christian. This isn't the first I've run into this. If an author wants to make the bad guys a group of Christians, so be it, but at least have them follow the The New Testament where Christ is found i.e. the term \"Christian\". As far as I would say, 'Christians' who only follow the Old Testament would actually be Jewish.Back to the story, remember I did say that overall I did enjoy it. It has a very strong beginning and the Fenestra creation, with the other mythos created around it is unique and interesting. The book ends satisfactorily but the two main characters are ready to set off for their future, making a sequel more than obvious. I would read a sequel should one be written."}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54099868-carla", "userReview": "La idea esta bien pero ahora puedo afirmar 100% que los libros de fantasia no son lo mio.

The plot is out of the ordinary, and truly unique. I loved the characters, they were so awesome and had great personalities. The whole idea of this book is amazing, the main character is Meridian, she has learned to live with death. Ever since she was just a little girl, bugs that came near her died. As she got older, bigger animals started to to die. She has come to live with the fact that she is the reason for the death of the innocent creatures, but, on the day of her birthday, she turns sixteen and she finds out that she doesn't kill them...she is half angel, and helps the dead cross over. As she got older, the window of which the dead path through slowly opened bigger, and now at the age of sixteen she is at full bloom and has a great amount of power. There's no time to question it because her parents send her off in a cab to a train station, she is to go on the train and arrive at her aunt's house. Meridian's life has now taken a huge turn, she has so many questions that no one will answer...She arrives at her aunt's house and meets Tens, who also lives with her Aunt. Meridian finally get's answers as her Aunt explains more about what she really is. Her life will never be the same, her whole life she thought she was a freak, and now she knows the real truth. Meridian doesn't know if she will ever see her family again; Her great aunt helps her with everything about her powers, but there's boy troubles, Tens isn't so nice, he seems to pretty much hate her, and Meridian has no idea why.On top of all of that, there is a Reverend in town who does everything he can to to bring down Meridian and her Aunt, he makes the rest of the town believe things that aren't true, leading to stares and whispers when Meridian, her Aunt and Tens just simply go into a restaurant.The plot thickens and Meridian finds out more about with her power, and how to use it, Tens is more that someone she lives with and now they must stop the Reverend, and deal with the evil that is hunting Meridian down...This was a great book, I wasn't expecting the whole religious part of it, but it was still good.

The new ideas, the new supernaturals, the new EVERYTHING was what kept me reading. Because it certainly wasn't Meridian or her \"guardian\", Tens. No, I read this for its uniqueness.I'm sure that you have gathered by now that I didn't exactly love MERIDIAN. No, although the beginning was interesting and attractive, this book slowly turned into a bunch of boring scenes that kept the small cast of characters at home, trying to figure something out that I still didn't quite understand when I flipped the book shut. Even though the plot spiraled upwards in the beginning, sometimes you need to spin into smaller, semi-plots. (I think I just said \"plot\" five times.)Meridian wasn't special to me - she wasn't very funny, she didn't do much, she didn't strike me as compassionate or kick-ass or dangerous. Or soft. She struck me as a meaningless person and totally unlike everybody I've ever met - everyone has an interesting quality. Thinking back, I don't think Kizer really wanted a character that others would be mad at or could find mistakes in. That's a problem because EVERYBODY and EVERYTHING does something that not everybody appreciates. Part of traveling a journey is to make bad decisions and false accusations. Meridian did none of that, and I didn't really feel as if she grew throughout the book.At first, Tens was adorable. I loved him. As I progressed through the novel though, like the plot (oops, that word again!) Tens started to drop from who he first showed us he was and started to fall into the pattern that almost EVERY. SINGLE. AUTHOR. CREATES. I was shown NO EVIDENCE of how Tens and Meridian were in love. God, I hate that. Not naming names, but a bunch of other writers do that and I wonder how they'd reflect, reading their work as if it was the work of someone else. And then, near the end of the book, his lines started to drop to nothing and he became the dull, somewhat sweet boy-toy again. More or less, I didn't like him very much.Auntie. Who calls someone who ISN'T your aunt...Auntie? Honestly, I felt like slapping any and everyone who called her that. CHARLES! Seriously, guys?

I really wanted to like it. Really. Honestly. But the problems for me started right at the beginning, with the bizarre family interactions. After reading the book, you know that Meridian's mother knows all along the basics of what's going on with her daughter. But instead of sitting her down and explaining it, she sits by while her daughter is ostracized, becomes sicker and sicker, and feels more and more like a freak. Not that we really get a good sense of any of this. We're just told, not shown any of it to make it real. Then we move on at breakneck speed to Auntie's, where the 'mysterious' Tens is waiting. No. Not mysterious. Weird. Because he has no set character. It's as if Kizer has this idea in her head that a teen romance has to have a brooding hero, so Tens is brooding. Then the hero has to thaw, so there's a train wreck (literally and figuratively) that makes him thaw. Suddenly there's kissy time all over the place. What? Then there's Auntie, who knows she's dying, but parcels out her important information to Meridian about what she is and what she does like there's all the time in the world. Oh, and then there's my biggest complaint about the book, the one that had me throwing my book down in frustration halfway through reading, not sure if I even wanted to continue. The big bad guy is a charismatic preacher. Except not really because he's an 'immortal' bad guy who wants the world to fall to chaos. Or something. It's not clear. But Kizer uses the world of Christianity to paint her baddie picture by taking verses out of context and giving us an extreme example of a cultist leader- which no one points out. There is no talk of this guy being an extremist, or insane, or what's going on in the congregation- no talk of mob mentality or the dangerous game of following the leader to avoid consequences. No, just a feeling that the congregation went insane when this guy showed up. Because they're Christians and that's what Christians do lolol hahaha crazy Christians. So okay, then at the end, the baddie manages to find them in their totes convenient Anasazi cave and is about to kill them, when NOT TO WORRY a random character from the beginning of the book shows up, talks in incomplete sentences, and turns the immortal baddie into nothing.

Kizer's vision of death is desirable and comforting. Her characters, especially Auntie and Custos, are enchanting. Meridian herself could easily be a candidate for one's best friend.Though not her first novel, Kizer could use a bit more guidance with future sequels to \"Meridian.\" For instance, the dialogue was not very witty and at times seemed thrown in just to take up space. Additionally, there was no build-up to the romance between Meridian and Tens; it's as if they just decided they would be together. In future novels, I hope that Tens will be fleshed out more. Currently, he is quite the mystery.The subplots in the novel revolving around the small town church turned cult was rather simplistic. Several \"hints\" were dropped along the way as to how Meridian's dilemmas would be solved, and I had them figured out long before they occurred.Despite its shortcomings, \"Meridian\" was a fantastic way to spend an afternoon. It's a novel I won't soon forget."}, {"userName": "- -", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3956651----", "userReview": "There is nothing i love more than a story that jumps right into action. So naturally Meridian instantly caught my attention. Not ten pages in did i have to wait for the action to start. Meridian isn't a slow passed book, but not entirely fast passed either (i suppose it's balanced) but i found the speed just right. Fast enough to keep you turning the pages as fast as you can and slow enough that you understand everything and you don't have to re-read a paragraph to make sure you understood. (Never thought I'd say this but....)Interesting take on death and how it all works. The fact of how different Meridian is strikes you from the first sentence 'The first creatures to seek me where the insects; my parents cleaned the bassinet of dead ants the morning after they brought me home from the hospital.' And from that first sentence i just had to know the mystery behind this strange girl and why dead things kept showing up around her. This answer came rather quickly which is the only thing i can find fault with. Though even then the story doesn't slow down for a minute it just picks up speed. I have to say me and my perceptiveness knew there was something more to be told with a connection between Tens and Meridian the second they met and am glad i was right :) You find out about halfway threw the story that Auntie has to train Meridian before she dies. This was rather sad but not at all depressing it just made the story even more interesting. I really really liked the ending. I know that's not much to go on but i don't want to give it away.You really need to add this book to the long list of books you need to read if you haven't already. I'm highly anticipating the second book and you can count on a random blog post as soon as any info is released about it."}], "description": "Half-human, half-angel, Meridian Sozu has a dark responsibility.Meridian has always been an outcast.
