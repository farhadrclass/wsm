Not because Chejfec is a difficult writer per se, nor because I find them exhausting, but there is resistance in his prose that I liken to someone inviting you in, but keeping his foot against the door. This seems a deliberate choice on Chejfec's part and it works: his works demand that rare, valuable thing from a reader: strict concentration. That concentration is paid off in full in Chejfec's brilliant moments, which shine through often enough to leave one feeling a little at a loss, as if the words on the page suddenly, fleetingly became something more substantial and true."}, {"userName": "Madeleine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4422439-madeleine", "userReview": "Uneven, ultimately \u2014\u00a0parts of it are lovely, deeply felt and engaging, and parts are not, failing alternately for being too vague or too explicit. Too many connections are explained which should have been left to intuit, and too much time is spent talking about silence when some actual silence would have sufficed. I'm left with the suspicion that this book isn't quite about what Chejfec thinks it's about, that the Sebaldian meditations on identity, memory, and the city, are ultimately weightless and beside the point. I like Chejfec's style and I look forward to reading his future books, but I wish that he would stop trying to write like Sebald and write more like himself. He's a surprisingly good storyteller (this was something I never managed to realize in My Two Worlds), and a better storyteller than philosopher. The existential conclusions the book draws are disappointingly obvious and do not explain the book (as if the book itself were a planet that could not see the star it was orbiting). P.S.

Despite that, I can appreciate that with its publication by Open Letter Books, Sergio Chejfec has presented English readers with a gentle novel on friendship, grief and loss. It is, ostensibly, a collection of memories told to us by the narrator about his childhood friend, M. M was abducted during Argentina\u2019s Dirty War. He disappeared, his fate unknown, leaving his friends and family in a kind of limbo. (Sergio Chejfec has stated that the book is in part based on a real life friend who did disappear in the 1970\u2032s). Some years later the narrator reads in the newspaper about an explosion outside of Buenos Aires. He believes, for no good reason and without evidence as far as I can see, that M was killed in it. What he has come to see as confirmation of M\u2019s death unleashes the flood of memories which make up The Planets. Eventually leading him to some kind of closure.Memories are not bound by the law of causality, linear space or time. And so we are forced to follow the disorganized train of the narrator\u2019s thoughts. Interspersed between the memories of M are other, related, memories \u2013 an encounter the narrator has with his and M\u2019s mutual friend, meeting M\u2019s mother after the abduction, stories told to him by M and M\u2019s father. It becomes tricky keeping track. This meandering stream-of-conscious style was also present in My Two Worlds, but the geography of the park in which that narrator walked provided a structure. Structure which I badly missed in The Planets\u2026. at least in the early chapters. Coming to terms with the lack of a lineal storytelling is a hurdle that has to be overcome in order to appreciate this novel.Like The Catcher in the Rye, The Planets is obliquely about grief. Like Salinger, Chejfec plays this information close to the chest. He engulfs you in his narrator\u2019s subconscious, leaving you to experience first hand the strange distance combined with an eery connection that exists between the person lost and the other left. Holden Caulfield mentions his dead brother briefly in passing, but his loneliness informs every line of the novel. The narrator of The Planets has assembled a montage of memories, yet his connection to M (he eventually acknowledges) is stretching and becoming tenuous. To confuse matters, his memories of M are mixed with fictional stories he\u2019s come to associate with the friendship. Some of those stories are split into parts, appearing at random intervals through the course of the book. It\u2019s often difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, but the experience of the narrator attempting to hold on to his grief and, through the emotion of grief his friend, is recognizable and feels real in its very ambiguity. Heather Cleary, the translator, has done a remarkable job of capturing what she refers to as a \u201ccertain \u2013 productive \u2013 dissonance\u201d in the text.*A highlight of The Planets, which is foremost a novel of ideas, is the narrator\u2019s explanation of how the static existence (or non-existence) of M, created by his disappearance and the mystery of his fate, has changed the orbits the two young men once traveled in relation to each other. Chejfec continuously references space, gravity, stars and the planets. The ongoing metaphor that he\u2019s created is startling because it is so beautiful.Sergio Chejfec seems to have an attachment to the cosmos, as demonstrated by his choice of titles. My Two Worlds, The Planets, and the upcoming The Dark, seem too pointed to be coincidental. As more of his books are translated into English, perhaps the significance (if one exists) will come to light. Which segues nicely into why I find Chejfec\u2019s writing interesting and exciting. There\u2019s so much there to explore. These aren\u2019t books to be quickly consumed and, just as quickly, forgotten. The Planets will linger, frustrate and engage \u2013 demanding you return to it to fully understood and appreciate its many layers (for example, I haven\u2019t even touched on the political aspect of the wartime setting). This is what I like best about Sergio Chejfec\u2019s novels \u2013 like the great classics of literature they live and grow with the reader. As such, they are never finished."}, {"userName": "Julianne (Outlandish Lit)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9581745-julianne-outlandish-lit", "userReview": "A very strange and surreal book. I don't really know how to explain the plot, so I'll let the publisher do it for me: When he reads about a mysterious explosion in the distant countryside, the narrator\u2019s thoughts turn to his disappeared childhood friend, M, who was abducted from his home years ago, during a spasm of political violence in Buenos Aires in the early 1970s. He convinces himself that M must have died in this explosion, and he begins to tell the story of their friendship through a series interconnected vignettes, hoping in this way to reanimate his friend and relive the time they spent together wandering the streets of Buenos Aires.Ok, that sounds about right. But this book isn't so much about the politics in Buenos Aires. This book is about memory, friendship, and loss. The narrator goes over many different segmented memories of himself and his time with his friend, M. The book meanders around, sharply focusing on certain instances for a while, then tumbles right into a new memory. I was tugged about by the narrator's thoughts, not by any real chronology. The unconventional structure was difficult at first, but it sort of parallels how memories really are.The Planets was definitely a slow read, but I do believe that it was worth it. Sometimes I would get so wrapped up in the strange stories told about M, or told by M with no apparent connection to any reality, that I wouldn't be able to stop thinking about them for the rest of the day. They seem hard to tie together as you're reading them, but taking the time to concentrate while reading definitely becomes worth it by the end. The narrator comes more clearly into focus, time starts to align, and we essentially see the impact of M's disappearance. I almost gave up on the book at the beginning, but I'm glad that I didn't.If you have the time to slowly read, and you don't mind a bit of philosophizing, I think this book is worth a shot. Especially if you have weird hang ups about/interest in memory. Like I do.

It deals with elegy through memory, and speculation through memory. Pinochet's regime and the masses of disappeared hover just outside of the periphery for most of the book, and only comes into focus at strategic and thoughtful points in the digressions. What this is about is incidental compared to how he talks about, to, and through his memories of his friend. A good portion of the book is the narrator relating his memory of his interaction with his friend M., who by accounts that he respects, is the one who should have been a writer. It is always ambiguous as to what their ages are when they speak to each other, and there is a section near the beginning where it feels unbelievable that kids would speak to each others in this way, and with this level of prescience, but the power of the turnaround in the story he tells about them as children around pg. 45-60 is worth the setup and ambiguity. Ambiguity in memory is drawn upon quite heavily in here. When the ages of the characters truly matter, to place them in a specific historical point, Chejfec does it very well. The introduction of the third character, Sito, as a pivot between them, and in the historical context, is nearly perfectly done. Heather Cleary deserves absolute praise and encouragement for her translation of this book. I am so happy that she is translating the next one that will be released in English, called The Dark."}, {"userName": "Leonardo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23829766-leonardo", "userReview": "En el comienzo de Los planetas, Sergio Chejfec escribi\u00f3: \"Aquella noticia hablaba de restos humanos esparcidos por una extensa superficie.

The us the narrator is referring to includes the narrator himself, whose name we never learn, and his childhood friend, referred to simply as M: \u201cM for Miguel, or Mauricio; it could also be M for Daniel since, as we know, any name at all can reside behind letters.\u201d M is the central figure of his friend\u2019s narrative, the enigmatic focal point around which the narrator\u2019s digressions circle. He exists in excess, but also in negation \u2014 a simultaneous presence and absence that forms the thematic backbone of the book.M was \u201cdisappeared,\u201d abducted during a period of political unrest in 1970s Buenos Aires, and the novel begins with a mysterious explosion years later. For some reason, the narrator comes to the odd conclusion that M, who has been missing without a trace, must have died in the explosion. Thus, the narrator is \u201coffered the only possibility of an ending.\u201d And yet that \u201cending\u201d is also a \u201cbeginning,\u201d as it becomes the impetus of the narrator\u2019s impassioned remembrances and intellectual wanderings that orbit the ghost-like M. \u201cA sense of loyalty to his memory leads me to write,\u201d the narrator confesses. Yet memory, as we quickly learn, is a problematic thing, one that is endlessly fallible:I feel unable to attribute any tangible trait, even a trivial one, to M; a feature, a gesture or expression, a past, a family, affect, et cetera. A reflected image that has slowly given way to negation, to shadow. The effect is unreal, and this unreal effect makes his life seem not only improbable, but also incidental. Did M exist? Yes, I say. But what was his time on earth like? It is all conjecture, I reasoned, the more time passes, the less I know. This lack of knowledge has nothing to do with forgetting, though that is what we call it, nor with the length of his absence, but rather with its excess.Read more here: http://www.full-stop.net/2012/10/09/r..."}, {"userName": "Susanna", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095801-susanna", "userReview": "The Planets is a difficult book to review. It took me a while to get into the writing, but once I did, I enjoyed the author's style. Plot-wise, though, the novel meandered all over the place. Normally I don't particularly mind this, but it seemed like periods of lucid anecdotes and other stories alternated with vague, rather confusing episodes of abstraction and philosophizing. I enjoyed the stories and anecdotes, not so much the rest of the content. I almost perpetually felt like there was some deeper meaning to everything that I was missing.For the sake of the concrete storytelling, though, let's go with a four-star (enjoyed it) rating. Both the anecdotes of M's and the narrator's lives, as well as the stories told by M and his father, were interesting at, at times, even engrossing when combined with Chejfec's excellent writing style. Parts of the book had an almost magical realist quality that I love in novels, though in this case it exists in the absence of any tangible magic or supernatural elements. This will be a book that I re-read in later years, hopefully to catch some of the more abstract intricacies that I missed on the first read-through.Thank you to First Look and the publisher for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Aaron (Typographical Era)  ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1054156-aaron-typographical-era", "userReview": "Mourning is such a profoundly strange and selfish process for an individual to work through.
