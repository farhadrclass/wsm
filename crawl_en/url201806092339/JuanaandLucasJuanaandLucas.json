Windows. Windowy mirrors. Mirrory windows. Windows. Mirrors. Sliding doors! Mirrors. Windows.In the world of 21st century children\u2019s literature, diversity should be the name of the game. We want books for our children that reflect the worlds they know and the worlds they have yet to greet. We want them to see themselves in their books (mirrors), see others unlike themselves (windows), and have a way to get from one place to another (sliding doors). To accomplish this, all you have to do is publish a whole bunch of books about kids of different races, religions, abilities, persuasions, you name it. Great strides have been made over the last few years in the general consciousness of the publishing industry (the publishers, the librarians, the teachers, and even the parents) even as teeny tiny, itty bitty, itsy bitsy tiptoes have been made in terms of what actually is getting published. Much of the credit for spearheading efforts to bring to light more and more books for all children can be given to the We Need Diverse Books movement. That said, our children\u2019s rooms are still filled with monumental gaps. Contemporary Jewish characters are rare. Muslim characters rarer still. And don\u2019t even TALK to me about the state of kids in wheelchairs these days. Interestingly enough, the area where diversity has increased the most is in early chapter books. Whether it\u2019s Anna Hibiscus,  Lola Levine, Alvin Ho, or any of the other new and interesting characters out there, there is comfort to be found in those books that transition children from easy readers to full-blown novels. Into this world comes Juana Medina and her semi-autobiographical series Juana & Lucas. Short chapters meet universal headaches (with details only available in Bogota, Colombia) ultimately combining to bring us a gal who will strike you as both remarkably familiar and bracingly original.You might think that Juana has it pretty good, and for the most part you\u2019d be right. She lives in Bogota, Colombia \u201cthe city that\u2019s closest to my heart\u201d with her Mami. She has a good furry best friend (her dog, Lucas) and a good not-so-furry best friend (Juli). And hey, it\u2019s the first day of school! Cool, right? Only nothing goes the way Juana planned. The whole unfortunate day is capped off when one of her teachers informs the class that they will be learning \u201cthe English\u201d this year. Could anything be more unfair? Yet as Juana searches for sympathy amongst her friends and relatives, she realizes that everyone seems to think that learning English is a good thing. Are they crazy? It isn\u2019t until an opportunity comes up to visit somewhere fantastic, far away, and English speaking that she finally takes what everyone has told her to heart. In a big way.I love, first and foremost, the fact that the emotional crux of this book is fixated on Juana\u2019s detestation of learning \u201cthe English\u201d. Now already I\u2019ve heard some commenters online complain that Juana\u2019s problem isn\u2019t something that English-speaking children will identify with. Bull. Any child that has ever learned to read will know where Juana is coming from. What English speaker would fail to sympathize when she asks, \u201cWhy are read and read written the same way but sound different? How can I know when people are talking about eyes or ice when they sound about the same? And what about left hand and left the room? So many words, so little sense\u201d? Some kids reading this book may have experience learning another language too. For them, Juana\u2019s complaints will ring true and clear. That\u2019s a key aspect of her personality. She\u2019s sympathetic, even when she\u2019s whining.For all that we\u2019ve seen books like Juana\u2019s, Lola Levine,  Zapato Power,  Pedro, First Grade Hero, and a handful of others, interestingly this increase in Latino early chapter book is relatively recent. For a long time it was Zapato Power or nothing. The change is great, but it\u2019s significant to note that all the books I\u2019ve mentioned here are set in the United States. American books set in South American countries where the kids just live their daily lives and don\u2019t have to deal with civil wars or invasions or coyotes or drug runners are difficult to find. What makes Juana and Lucas so unique is that it\u2019s about a child living her life, having the kinds of problems that Ramona or Ruby Lu or Dyamonde Daniel could relate to. And like Anna Hibiscus or The Great Cake Mystery I love books for younger children that go through daily life in other present day countries. Windows indeed.Early chapter books are interesting because publishers see them as far more series-driven than their writers might. An author can crank out title after title after title to feed the needs of their young readers, always assuming the demand is there, and they can do it easier with books under 100 pages than above. Juana could fit the bill in this regard. Her personality is likable, for starters. She\u2019s not rude like Junie B. Jones or willfully headstrong in the same way as Ramona, but she does screw up. She does complain wildly. There are aspects of her personality you can identify with right from the start. I\u2019d be pleased to see more of her in the future, and young readers will undoubtedly feel the same way. Plus, she has one particular feature that puts her heads and tails above a lot of the competition: She\u2019s in color.Created in ink and watercolor, Medina illustrates as well as writes her books. This art actually puts the book in a coveted place few titles can brag. You might ask if there\u2019s a middle point between easy books and, say, Magic Tree House titles. I\u2019d say this book was it. Containing a multitude of full-color pictures and spreads, it offers kids the comfort of picture books with the sensibility and sophistication of chapter book literature. And since she\u2019s already got the art in place, why not work in some snazzy typography as well? Medina will often integrate individual words into the art. They swoop and soar around the characters, increasing and decreasing in size, according to their wont. Periodically a character will be pulled out and surrounded by fun little descriptor tidbits about their personage in a tiny font. Other times sentences move to imitate what their words say, like when Juana discusses how Escanilberto can kick the ball, \u201chard enough to send it across the field.\u201d That sentence moves from his foot to a point just above his opponent\u2019s head, the ball just out of reach. I like to think this radical wordplay plays into the early reader\u2019s enjoyment of the book. It\u2019s a lot more fun to read a chapter book when you have no idea what the words are going to pull on you next.The writing is good, though the conclusion struck me as a bit rushed. Admittedly the solution to Juana\u2019s problems is tied up pretty quickly. She won\u2019t learn, she won\u2019t learn, she won\u2019t learn. She gets to have a prize? She studies and studies and studies. So rather than have her come to an understanding of English\u2019s use on her own, an outside force (in this case, the promise of seeing Astroman) is the true impetus to her change. Sure, at the very end of the book she suddenly hits on the importance of learning other languages and visiting other places around the globe but it\u2019s a bit after the fact. Not a big problem in the book, of course, but it would have been cool to have Juana come to this realization without outside influences.As nutty as it sounds, Juana and Lucas is a bit short on the \u201cLucas\u201d side of that equation. Juana\u2019s the true star of the show here, relegating man\u2019s best friend to the sidelines. Fortunately, I have faith in this series. I have faith that it will return for future sequels and that when those sequels arrive they\u2019ll have a storyline for Lucas to carry on his own. With Juana nearby, of course. After all, she belongs to the pantheon of strong female early chapter characters out there, ready to teach kids about life in contemporary Colombia even as she navigates her own trials and successes. And it\u2019s funny. Did I mention it\u2019s funny? You probably got that from context, but it bears saying. \u201cJuana and Lucas\u201d is the kind of book I\u2019d like to see a lot more of. Let\u2019s hope Ms. Medina is ready to spearhead a small revolution of early chapter book international diversity of her very own.For ages 6-9"}, {"userName": "Mitticus", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4765800-mitticus", "userReview": "+Digital copy gently provided by Netgalley in exchange for a honest review+I wanted to read something fluffy after my last book, so I grab this.

A character, who is a kid, who loves Brussels sprouts! That is really a first in a long time since I saw a kid whose favourite food is this. Normally in books with kids it is all about how they hate it, how they are disgusted by it.So when I saw this little girl loved Brussels sprouts\u2026 well what could possibly go wrong then. And then came the part where she said she loved reading books. A girl who loves books and Brussels sprouts? Wow. That is truly a first I have seen this combination in a book.I loved how she introduced us to her city, and also told us various fun things about the city. Like the language (Spanish), about the weather and more.The introduction about her dog Lucas was done really fun (with a drawing of her dog and then all kinds of lines pointing at him, telling us what kind of skills he has, what kind of dog he is). And she did the same for her best friend and several other characters that were important to the story. It is a shame that my tablet broke up the pages, but I am sure in a paper-format this kind of thing looks really nice.The book is about Juana having to learn English, and how much trouble she is having with it. She also doesn\u2019t get why she should learn English, which gave me a chuckle, though I could understand her. So she pops by various characters to see what their view is on English and why she should learn it. Finally she finds one reason, and what that reason is? Well, you will have to read this book to find out. I do have to say that I loved that reason. It is a fun one, and it motivated Juana enormously.There was one thing I didn\u2019t entirely like. The Spanish words that were thrown in at random intervals. While I do know some words in Spanish, I don\u2019t know a lot. Some words were just simple and I could easily figure out what they meant, but some of them meant I had to grab my Spanish dictionary (yes, I have one, because a few years back I tried to learn Spanish, and I still want to go back to learning it again).Also in my copy (pdf) the letters at times turned half invisible which made it really hard to read.I really loved the illustrations in this one.All in all? I would recommend this series, and I will be sure to buy the book when it comes out in paperback. Of course I will also keep an eye on the rest of the series (when it comes out) as well.Review first posted at https://twirlingbookprincess.com/"}, {"userName": "Margie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5281649-margie", "userReview": "Navigating through life, even if you tend to be an optimist, is much better when shared with a friend. If this friend should happen to be a dog, you could not ask for a better companion and confidant. A dog's affection never wavers plus they probably understand every single thing you say. They are the best secret keepers. They dispense advice with a look, a nudge or a tail wag.If you happen to be beginning another year of school, a dog can get you through any difficulties you encounter. Juana & Lucas (Candlewick Press, September 27, 2016) written and illustrated by Juana Medina provides readers with an up-close and personal view on growing up in Bogota, Colombia through the eyes of a lovable, lively little girl.

I read it for my Children's Lit class, and honestly it's not something I would have picked up on my own because it's just a little too young for jr high students (which is a shame, because it reminds me of \"Barrio Boy\" and \"Names/Nombres\", both of which we teach during the memoir unit, which could use some updating!). Anyway, it's about an adorable, pigtailed Columbian 4th grade girl who has to learn English. And she hates it, because let's be honest, English is a ridiculous language. There's a great line in Barrio Boy about the \"awful idiocies\" of the English language (that I often reference when teaching grammar) and Medina just nails so many of those. The illustrations are also adorable, and the general enthusiasm and likability of this character just leaps off the page. I also love that Medina includes so much Spanish vocabulary throughout the novel, and doesn't bother to translate any of it. If you're paying attention to context or the illustrations, it's all pretty clear, so it doesn't need to be translated. And in the end, yes, Juana learns English, but she also realizes that she wants to travel, which means she will need to learn more languages too. I like that the message is about learning and having a global perspective, rather than just, \"isn't life so much better now that you can talk American?!\" Also, the dog is adorable, but to be honest I'm not 100% sure why he's part of the title. I thought it might be a girl and her dog on grand adventures, but he's not super important to the story.

I have the day off of work because I live a couple of streets away from Arlington National Cemetery and my office is on Pennsylvania Avenue. It\u2019s still a Friday, but the library is closed and I don\u2019t want to turn on the TV. I do want to do something constructive \u2013 something that will make a difference and build up my spirits. So, I\u2019m reviewing a book by a local author \u2013 by a Spanish-speaking immigrant, even. I want to share with you a book that is adorable, smart, different, and immensely readable. Let\u2019s talk about Juana Medina\u2019s Juana & Lucas.Juana is a rambunctious girl who lives in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia with her mother and her dog Lucas. Juana loves many things \u2013 her abuelos (grandparents), art, her best friend at school, her city (and of course her Mami and Lucas!)\u2026 but she does not love learning English. It\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s boring, and she wonders what the point is. When her grandfather tells her that the family will visit Florida, everything changes. Juana MUST learn English!Juana & Lucas is an illustrated chapter book with a lot of heart. Juana has the same sort of thoughts and worries and dreams as any kid \u2013 she\u2019s relatable, and she\u2019s smart and fun. While Juana is hilariously lamenting how boring English is, she drops many little tidbits about life in Colombia, and the reader learns a bit of Spanish too \u2013 all Spanish words are italicized and understandable in the context of the story. Juana\u2019s happy, functioning family (in a unique environment) is also important, as oftentimes parents in children\u2019s lit are absent, dead, or worse.Author Juana Medina both wrote and illustrated the text, and her art is a colorful mix of black lines and watercolor. The effect is cheery and vibrant, and the simplicity of the figures and outlines is likely to inspire her grade-school readers to imitate and carry on telling Juana\u2019s future adventures. My favorite page spreads were the ones where Juana identifies every item by name.In all, Juana & Lucas is a vibrant, fun early picture book for any kid or kid-at-heart.Recommended for: early readers, reluctant readers, fans of comics and art, and\u2026 anyone, really!"}, {"userName": "Julie Seifert", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3024274-julie-seifert", "userReview": "LOVE"}, {"userName": "Sarah Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1002270-sarah-johnson", "userReview": "Good as a read aloud for kindergarten and 1st grade."}, {"userName": "Turrean", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5348205-turrean", "userReview": "Perfect for my kiddos learning Spanish!

I was excited to add this to my library collection because we don\u2019t have a lot of early chapter books that depict characters from South America. This book also received the Pura Belpre Award.The protagonist in this story is a Juana, a young girl that is not a fan of school and learning English. She loves her family, her dog, and her favorite class at school is recess, so she can play futbol. The story deals with the struggles she goes through with understanding why she should learn English. Eventually, she is influenced by her Grandfather and finds out she can go to Spaceland in the U.S. if she learns English, so she becomes motivated.Juana Medina is an author and an illustrator, so this book is filled with lots of beautiful pictures. It isn\u2019t set up like a traditional chapter book. It infuses the words with the illustrations. I think that makes it interesting for children. The author also includes many Spanish words through out the text. The words are easy enough to figure out through the context of the story. I think this would appeal to bilingual students. The main character is also relatable to those students who are learning English as another language. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked to see a little more plot development. Overall I enjoyed the book and I liked Juana as a character.

Juana is beginning to learn English in school but, she's having problems. Her story persists with Juana and Lucas as they go through her daily life; playing soccer (Futbol), going to school, playing with family and learning how important learning English can be. Each page, is filled with a parts of Juana's experiences and that resonated with me personally, and she has a way with words that allow readers to truly empathize with what she's saying. The author uses various forms of typography to help illustrate her feelings for example, increasing the font when she feels REALLY strongly about something. Juana is very much like other kids I know: she has fun, loves her family, gets bored and gets irritated and she expresses this in a certain way in the story. In several pages she uses \"Idea webs\", centering certain people like her Mami and Abuelo telling us, the readers, how she feels about them. This was very interesting,as I had never seen something like this done in a book before and it really helped me feel how important they were in her life. I also loved how the author mixed Spanish words into the text when Juana spoke it made her words feel natural and made Juana's character very genuine.

The book has quite a bit of text but the colorful drawings and the way the letters are placed make it a fun read. One thing I particularly like about this book is that it has a Latina protagonist. Although the book is primarily an English narration by Juana, some Spanish is incorporated into the book, for example, when Juana sits next to her friend Juli on the bus she says: \u201cSitting with Juli is always good because we have mucho to talk about\u201d (p.g 11). This is a fun way to introduce kids to Spanish and broaden their cultural horizons. I also find that the book is quite relatable for kids in the process of learning English. Growing up in Puerto Rico and having to learn English at a young age was as frustrating for me as it was for Juana. I believe that reading this book would have helped my learning process, it would have encouraged me to know that other kids go through the same struggles. Not only that but it would have made an excellent reading exercise. I\u2019m giving the book 4 stars because the ending was a bit rushed for my taste. I also found the title a bit misleading as there was hardly any Lucas in the book.

What is not just right for this age group is the sprinkling of Spanish words in a text that is 97% English, especially not when the main character lives in a Spanish-speaking country, and the conflict that comes up, about 1/3 into the story, is all about learning English. At that point, any reader would wonder how she was already speaking perfect English, with sprinkles of Spanish words, if she didn't yet know any English. In fact, on page 3, Juana, as the first-person narrator, says, \"My favorite food...is Brussels sprouts. In Bogot\u00e1, Brussels sprouts are called repollitas.\" This leads us to believe that she is already bilingual. So, the crisis is a surprise - why is learning English a trauma for her when she already seemed to be fully bilingual? In real life, bilingual people often use whichever word comes to mind first, so sprinkling their English with Spanish or vice-versa is common. But Juana is supposed to be monolingually Spanish until Chapter 9, page 64, when she truly puts her mind to learning English. It would have made more sense for the English-learning to start a bit earlier in the story arc than page 28, and to use occasional Spanish words with more overt attention. For example, as she started learning, she could have used both English and Spanish words for select things that are likely to come up in a language-learning process. In that case, the reader would do a sort of mental \"switch\" in that she would be seen as speaking one language (Spanish, that we read as English) and learning another (English, that we read as Spanish). The color illustrations would lend themselves well to visual labels, like the ones she makes for the Herrera brothers' store. Instead, Medina shows Juana doing the fully-bilingual thing of using seemingly random Spanish words in an otherwise completely English first-person narration. These random Spanish vocabulary words will pose a difficulty for many \"moving up\" readers who are not yet fully fluent in reading, and for adults reading aloud who might butcher the pronunciation to the point of misleading the listener. For example, \"...the morning is especialmente beautiful...\" \"...we have mucho to talk about...\"...my lunch box tragedia...\" are all examples of when the translated word is one that might be emphasized for drama, but not the one that carries the most significance. The book may be perfect for readers like Medina herself, who speak and read fluently in English, and were raised speaking (and perhaps reading & writing) fluently in Spanish. If so, when Juana complains about having to learn English, they may relate to Juana's sentiment that learning a second language is just annoying, and nobody should take for granted its value without some argument. They may also have that delicious superior feeling that comes from understanding something that others struggle with. I think Medina could have provided that delicious feeling while still having the language set-up make sense, and while also including all the other readers who haven't had the chance to learn more than one language, but who could choose to do so if a book effectively showed the advantage. Unfortunately, Juana's motivation to learn turns out to be a chimera, as Astroman doesn't respond to her when she gets to Spaceland in Florida. When that happens, all the bilingual readers (the best readers of this book) will feel disappointed at her having worked hard for a goal that turned out to be quite different in the end - not pointless, but not nearly as exciting as the plan."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "This winner of the Pura Belpre Award for Author will provide some inspiration and amusement for many young readers who are already fluently bilingual or trying to learn another language. As readers will realize from the opening pages, Juana is a passionate young girl who has many loves, a love which she expresses enthusiastically. She loves her home city of Bogota, Columbia, her dog Lucas, Astroman, and reading. Although she enjoys school, math is not much fun for her, and school gets harder when her teacher introduces a new subject. It might surprise some readers when Juana's teacher decides that her class will learn English. She and her classmates struggle with it, of course, because of its inconsistencies with multiple meanings for some words and words that sound alike but are spelled differently or mean something different. Each of the mentors in her life provides good reasons for learning English, but her grandfather gives the best one of all. He has planned a trip to Spaceland where she might meet Astroman. Now highly motivated, Juana throws herself into her lessons and even works on her English at home. The funny twist at the end in which Juana chats enthusiastically with everyone she meets at the theme park but gets no verbal response from Astroman will make readers smile. While some might think the experience will put her off learning languages, instead, having caught the travel bug, Juana decides that she wants to learn even more languages so she can talk to others around the world. The use of abundant white space to surround the ink and watercolor illustrations lends the book a fresh appearance that is appealing. I liked the sprinkling of Spanish throughout the story and the pages in which one character or object would appear surrounded by simple comments. Fans of Clementine and Judy Moody are likely to enjoy this book. It could certainly provide reassurances for many young readers trying to tackle a new language."}, {"userName": "Liz Exo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20633348-liz-exo", "userReview": "Juana & Lucas is a young reader chapter book (grades 1-3) which features Juana (\"pronounced who-a-nah,\" as she so self-assuredly tells the reader on page one) and her journey to go see her favorite character, Astroman, in person at a amusement park in Florida. Juana's story chronicles her daily life in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia where she goes to school, shops, plays, and does homework, all in Spanish. Her problem arises when her teacher announces suddenly that they will begin to learn...\"the English!\" Juana's life is turned upside down as she tries to navigate this new, confusing language. In the end, she finds personal motivation to learn English, and it starts with \"Astro\" and ends with \"man.\"This chapter book has great character development. Juana loves to explain why she loves things (i.e. her dog, her aunt, her mami) complete with diagrams and witty captions. Another unique touch is the Spanish words that are inserted throughout the book! Most of the Spanish words are cognates or very contexualized that even a young reader without any Spanish knowledge would be able to figure out their meaning. This adds a fun element to Juana's storytelling. This feature could even be used to teach how to use context clues to determine the meaning of unknown words!"}, {"userName": "Monica Simpson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70653835-monica-simpson", "userReview": "Juana loves her dog and brussel sprouts. Juana hates her school uniform.Juana loves her Mami and her abuelos. Juana hates that she has to learn \"the English\".Set in Bogota', Colombia, Juana and Lucas takes us on the simple but entertaining adventure of a young girl who has a best friend, a crabby school bus driver, a caring support community, and one really huge frustration (in addition to all of the everyday frustrations). The illustrations and even the font of this story really help us to understand more about Juana and what she feels in any given situation. Her child-like honesty is spot on and humorous: \"When a grown-up says something is going to be a ton of fun, it mans that there will be NO FUN AT ALL. Not even a single bit of fun. Nada de fun.\" What lessons might Juana learn as she has to do the not-fun-at-all thing anyway?The Spanish words that appear regularly through the story are never defined for the reader, but the meanings are not difficult to infer in the confines of the tale. Juana's contagious personality will easily draw in young readers as well as those having the story read to them. There are lots of chances to role play if you're reading this to children."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70548560-kristina", "userReview": "Summary:Juana is a sweet, spunky, expressive girl from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

How will she react when she discovers that Abuelo is taking her on a trip to Spaceland in Florida? Evaluation:Winner of the 2017 Pura Belpr\u00e9 Award, Juana and Lucas, is a realistic fiction chapter book for readers grades 1-3. Even though Juana is a young Latina girl, this book will appeal to a wide variety of readers because of its wit, charm, and humor. Every child can see something of themselves in Juana. I like how the author uses font size to show when Juan is really emotive, as well as captions and word webs to show Juana's thinking. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, however, I feel it lacked in some character development, and the ending of the book was a bit to abrupt for my taste.Teacher Recommendation:For a teacher with some Spanish language skills this would be a great read aloud. I think this book would also work as a guided reading book for English Language Learners as well. This book would also make a great mentor text for writer's workshop when teaching about voice."}, {"userName": "RLL220_Karen Segura", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79899722-rll220-karen-segura", "userReview": "Juana & Lucas by Juana Medina is a story about Juana a little girl from Bogota Colombia, who loves to play soccer and has a best friend named Lucas, her dog.

However, after talking to her grandpa who went to medical school in Chicago, told her she needed to learn it if she wanted to meet Astroman. Overall, she seems to overcome the challenge of learning English. This book can be read by children in the 3rd or 4th grade because it\u2019s a small chapter book. The illustrations have a lot of earthy colors along with watercolors. This book can be used to assign a book to read for children and have them answer questions of Juana\u2019s character and through their social emotional, by having them explore how they would feel if they were in the same position. They can also write their own story relating to Juana & Lucas.
