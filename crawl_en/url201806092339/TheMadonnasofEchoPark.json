From the meta-pseudobiographical author's note, to the first couple of stories, I was riveted. I loved the interweaving story idea to create a novel. I was drawn in by the language (though perhaps overwritten at times), I was intrigued by the characters who felt honest and compelling, and the book made me nostalgic for Southern California. I settled into chew through a book that I would be exhilarated by. And at first I was. I really loved the second story, \"Blossoms of Los Feliz\". I think the first few stories are the strongest of the book. But when I got to the one about the bus driver, I began to feel it was a little too self-conscious. The bus driver didn't feel authentic to me, and the book felt like it took a turn away from the lovely, honest pieces that the first stories were, and became a book that the author felt had to BE something. Skyhorse is a great writer -- but I felt like in the second half of the book, I could see him working, trying to get a point and a lesson across in a way that was overt, something I hadn't felt in the first half of the book. It's still a great read and not at all a chore to get through, but something about the second half felt less complex and honest and believable, and that disappointed me. Also, I'm not sure the ending section tied in all the strings completely or even as artfully as I'd have hoped -- something which, of course, is a difficult thing to do. Overall though, I still enjoyed it greatly, and in no way was it a bad book. I think I just felt it couldn't have been even better if it taken a more subtle route, and allowed the characters to just emerge on their own instead of being saddled with the preconceived themes of the book. But still, very enjoyable in a lot of ways."}, {"userName": "Madeline Knight-Dixon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5518809-madeline-knight-dixon", "userReview": "This is one of those books that is constantly making you think, and constantly realize how ignorant Americans are. It\u2019s about Echo Park, a Latino neighborhood in LA that is predominately Mexican. One of the chapters focuses on illegal workers, how terribly their treated and how much they are looked down upon even from people in their own community. The novel constantly struggles with are you a Mexican-American, or an American-Mexican.At its core, the book is about identity. Can you escape your cultural identity, or do you have to live in the space created by your race? Do you have to fit into the gender roles your culture gives you? What about the expectations your family has for you? Each character that narrates the book is striving to answer these questions, and figure out how to live their lives with what they have been given.It\u2019s also about the interconnectedness of communites. Without knowing it, each person in the novel is connected to each other. Whether it\u2019s through chance encounters, family ties, relationships gone wrong, or violent crimes, they all have influenced each other\u2019s lives. There may not be a moral message in this, but it\u2019s important to note nonetheless that no matter how hard you try you can\u2019t escape from your roots.Throughout the story, there\u2019s the smallest touches of mysticism. A sighting of the Virgin Mary, \u201cthe Lord\u201d who frequents the neighborhood, a flower that\u2019s omnipresent. It becomes not a novel about religion, but a novel about faith, and finding that faith in your own way. Faith can come in any form, from hard work to cynacism, but allowing yourself something to believe in that is greater than yourself.It\u2019s a beautiful book, and while it is an extremely important work of contemporary Latin American literature, it\u2019s also an important book aboutlife.That\u2019s what I find so perfect, is that it transcends the label people attempt to put on it. It\u2019s staggering and moving, human beyond the concept of race."}, {"userName": "Leonard", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard", "userReview": "The Madonnas of Echo Park tells the stories of Mexicans who struggle through their daily lives in Echo Park, a section of Los Angeles. The book starts with \"We slipped into this country like thieves, onto the land that once was ours,\" and ends with \"This is the land that we dream of, the land that belongs to us again.\" A summary of the characters' attitudes toward the land they love and struggle to claim as their home. Echo Park (Photo by User2004 at Wikimedia Common)For a migrant worker, \"I have no heartbreaking story of the journey here; the heartbreaking journey is here, in this small couple of square miles of land called Echo Park.\" And for the bus driver, \"America is there for the taking if you aren't lazy and have no qualms about the kind if work you do.\" Succinct descriptions of their lives in the United States. They are among those who know that life is tough but also that America is the land of opportunities.At the same time, Skyhorse shows his witticism when he said, through another character that \"Catholicism gives everyone something to feel ashamed about.\" And the lady of the house spoke broken English to the maid, believing the latter doesn't understand a word. When in fact the maid understands the mistress and was learning English through her daughter. These bits of humor modulate the gravity of the subject matter.Through the book, Mr. Skyhorse gives voice to the voiceless and shape to the invisible. And he fills the writing with insights into the dynamics between these invisible people and the country that they seek to claim as home."}, {"userName": "Jimmie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072523-jimmie", "userReview": "There's been a string of critically acclaimed novels lately that are basically collections of interrelated character-driven vignettes with little plot (e.g., \"Elegance of the Hedgehog,\" \"Let the Great World Spin,\" \"Olive Kitteridge,\" \"The Imperfectionists\"--which is one of my Top 5 reads of 2010). I think the book that comes the closest to \"Madonnas\" is James Frey's \"Bright Shiny Morning,\" not only because they're both set in Los Angeles (or that they were both less well-loved by critics), but also because, even during the seemingly light-hearted funny parts, there's always this cold wistfulness lingering just next to you as you read.The jacket copy seems to imply that this book is about what happens to the bystanders after a little girl named Alma, dressed with many other girls as Madonna and performing \"Borderline\" on the street corner, is accidentally killed in a drive-by. And it is, kinda. But it's really more about the invisible divisions of Los Angeles and the connections that stretch between them.The book is tender, mordant, heart-breaking, beautiful.It's no secret that, of all the places I've lived, Echo Park is far and away my favorite. But even were that not so, I think I would have loved this book almost exactly as much as I do now.I only have two criticisms. The first is that about halfway through, I had to pull out a pad of paper and write a flowchart/genogram to keep track of all the characters and their relationships. Also, with each chapter written from a different character's POV, I think Skyhorse had a little trouble staying \"in character\" sometimes. Specifically, the chapter about Manny Jr., a lifelong gang member who dropped out of junior high school and thinks books are \"faggoty\" speaks a little too well, has a little too advanced of a vocabulary, and is a little too eloquent to be believable."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "Brief news flash: Both of my cataract surgeries are now complete. I can see everything without glasses! Well, except for small print close up in poorly lit places, for which I use those reading glasses you can buy at pharmacies. I am so happy!Now onto my review. Except for a trip on the week of Christmas, I shall be posting regularly again. Thank you for your patience.My hand-crafted, boutique, and very special Tiny Book Group is on a project to read books set in Los Angeles. All three of us are from elsewhere, having come to LA in middle age. Echo Park is a Los Angeles neighborhood that began as a Mexican ghetto and has lately succumbed to gentrification. Brando Skyhorse grew up in Echo Park in the 1980s.His truly wonderful novel is a successful example of a novel written as a series of collected stories featuring characters who appear again and again. By the end you know how they are connected through family and events.\"We slipped into this country like thieves, onto the land that once was ours.\" There is so much history in that opening sentence. It took my breath away. But history is the last thing on the minds of Skyhorse's characters. Their minds are crowded with fears of deportation, struggles to learn English, make a living, and assimilate.Every living American today, except for Native Americans, is an immigrant or a descendant of immigrants. I wonder how many immigrant novels have been written here. Brando Skyhorse (descended from Mexicans but raised to think that his Native American step-father was his biological father) took this often told story and made it pulse with sights, smells, tastes, loves, deaths, and the infinite variety of human longings.To see images of the following locations and get the link to the video mentioned below please go to my blog: http://keepthewisdom.blogspot.com.The Tiny Book Group met in Echo Park to discuss the book. We ate lunch at Xoia Vietnamese Eats.We got pastries at Masa of Echo Park Bakery & Cafe.We strolled to Echo Park Lake to eat our treats,then to Stories Books to choose our next read.All the while we talked about the book and wondered, \"Where have all the Mexicans gone?\"Part of the answer can be found in this video, but most of the answers have been encapsulated in The Madonnas of Echo Park.One more thing: reading and learning about the incident that inspired the book's title was a little piece of literary magic."}, {"userName": "Luke Schwiebert", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15709605-luke-schwiebert", "userReview": "This book will surprise you. Not in its themes or its writing style (though the former are important and the latter is excellent), but in it's presentation: every single chapter is told by a different character. This isn't made obvious at first, so you may get thrown for a loop at the beginning of Chapter 2, but once you figure it out, it really works.I've read some other reviews that say that Madonnas \"isn't really a novel, more like a short story collection.\" I guess that's true on its face, since every individual chapter has a beginning, middle, and end, but the stories are all clearly meant to be read together. On their own, they would feel inconclusive and fairly pointless; only when they're tied together, and read in their proper designated order, do they fill out a full story. The book is especially interesting in the ways the stories tie together. Sometimes it's obvious - one's told by a mother, and the next, by her daughter, for instance - but others feel totally unrelated, until a shocking hammer of a line reveals the integral part that the protagonist plays in the overall story.These masterfully interwoven tales tell the story of Echo Park, a place that many people may not have even heard of - I'm an Angeleno and I've never even been there! - but which has made it's immortal mark on the people that lived there. These characters may be fictional (save for Aurora Esparanza, who's based on a girl that Skyhorse used to know), but the people are real, and it's about time their stories were told."}, {"userName": "Tattered Cover Book Store", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1009462-tattered-cover-book-store", "userReview": "Jackie says:This book had me from the author's note, which begins, \"This book waswritten because of a twelve-year-old girl named Aurora Esperanza.\" Itseems that he, who was also 12 at the time, had said something terrible to her and then never saw her again, so was unable to apologize to her directly. He had to find a different way to apologize, and now, 25 years later, he has. In the form of this book. \"I'm ready to dance with you, Aurora. This is my confession.

This book is a fascinating patchwork ofinterwoven (whether they know it or not) lives and experiences that show what it is to be Mexican-American in LA (and perhaps anywhere).Skyhorse introduces us to characters who may only be a brief part of any given story but linger in the reader's mind long after the covers close on the book.

I do enjoy the concept of interrelated stories that create an overall novel-like effect and it has been used to memorable effect by Saroyan (The Human Comedy) and Steinbeck (Tortilla Flat and The Pastures of Heaven). I will start out by saying that I enjoyed at least half of these stories very much. The Blossoms of Los Feliz, Our Lady of the Lost Angels, Rules of the Road, Yo Soy El Army and The Hustler were quite good. The others I felt tried a bit too hard to force something extraordinary to come out of very ordinary characters and situations, which just didn\u2019t work for me. The obsessions of teenaged girls with pop stars that drive several of the other stories didn\u2019t resonate with me and the last (and in my opinion the weakest) story in the work, La Luz y La Tierra, seemed to be a conscious (and rather long) attempt to gather all of the story lines together when it just wasn\u2019t necessary. In the weaker stories I felt that I was being beaten over the head with the \u201cmessage\u201d that I was expected to take away. Tortilla Flat deals with the same ethnic group at a different place in the history of California, yet Steinbeck brings a mythical air and humor to the lives of these characters that is lacking in Skyhorse\u2019s work, which is admittedly more current and gritty, but also more deliberate and lacks the master\u2019s subtle touch. But considering that this is Skyhorse\u2019s first novel the jacket blurb to the effect that we may be witnessing the coming of a top notch new literary talent may well be true. I certainly plan on following this author."}, {"userName": "Daisy ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1013908-daisy", "userReview": "I'm ready to dance with you, Aurora.

It\u2019s author, Brando Skyhorse writes in his author\u2019s notes (which were in the beginning of the novel, which I LOVE), that he wrote this novel as a \u201cforgive me\u201d note to a twelve year old girl whom he disrespected in 6th grade. Beyond that, Skyhorse wanted to give voice to the Mexican American community who grew up in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles during the 1950\u2019s to the present. All the stories are basically true, drawn from his childhood memories. All the people who\u2019s voices he used wanted to make it clear that \u201che or she was a proud American FIRST, an American who happened to be Mexican, not the other way around.\u201d Also, this is an illuminating read of those Mexican Americans who want to just stay in the country. It isn\u2019t about the struggles of how they got here. It\u2019s more about their life here and what they do to stay.Each chapter is about a character, told in that character\u2019s voice. Each character\u2019s story ties to other character\u2019s storylines so there is a flow. Through each character, Skyhorse is able to highlight different struggles, attitudes, events that the community feels while trying to assimilate to the American Culture. It\u2019s the Latino story of Echo Park. Skyhorse\u2019s writing style is easy to read. He\u2019s telling stories. There isn\u2019t significant prose involved. What is involved is stories that will change the way you see Mexican Americans. Books that illuminate and alter perceptions are phenomenal in that alone. It\u2019s a great read and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Robert Starner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2870270-robert-starner", "userReview": "This is a book that I will definitely need to revisit. I am not sure that it got my undivided attention, and this book respectfully commands and deserves it. The author presents a kaleidoscope of imagery and characters that populate the ethnic neighborhood of Echo Park buried in downtown L.A. Much like the movie Crash, Skyhorse weaves and interconnects the stories of many inhabitants of Echo Park through familial and non-familial relationships with one of the main events involving the driveby shooting that kills a young girl who is celebrating Madonna's Borderline video outside the mercado where part of the video was originally shot. The characters are well crafted and the incidents that tie the characters together are greatly intriquing. I did repeatedly find the beginnings of some of the vignettes confusing and somewhat hard to follow and that would not gain my immediate interest. But several of the tales are redeemed within the last third and become quite riveting. The author's note at the beginning is quite an alluring tale, but it is also part of the fiction of the novel and not knowing this at the beginning definitely altered my view of the novel and the author, and not necessarily to the better. So well I am judgmental here, I will revisit this book a bit later and definitely block out as many distractions as possible to give it a more focused read."}, {"userName": "Constance", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/602423-constance", "userReview": "Gosh, I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't even finish it. The primary word that I keep thinking of to describe this book is \"inartful.\" It is SO awfully and badly executed, in its voices, character descriptions, plot development, everything. It is also inconsistent and hard to follow! Did anyone edit this book?! Here's a one example of many: One chapter is written from the voice of an older Latina woman (another is uninterestingly written from the voice of a self-hating American-born Mexican-American, yawn). She is having a conversation with a priest about a vision she had of the Virgin Mary. The priest begins asking her questions, \"not a trace of disbelief or suspicion in his voice.\" Seven lines later, the priest says, \"I see. And where did this 'meeting' take place?\" Don't those single quotes indicate some sort of disbelief?! Anyway, that's a minor complaint, but suffice to say that it is hard to tell the tone of many of the conversations in the book and even hard to tell what the hell is happening at key moments sometimes.

Skyhorse skillfully brings readers into Echo Park, and offers a holistic perspective on the many challenges its population faces. He develops a plot line that reads almost like a movie - each character's chapter/story seems unique and more revealing than the ones before until, suddenly, one realizes that the current narrator is actually the previous narrator's mother and a later character-narrator's grandmother. In addition to fantastic, believable, yet sometimes magically real prose, Skyhorse incorporates a number of contemporary social issues that affect all people, but especially some of the nation's most vulnerable and already disfavored populations. Without casting judgment or imposing his own opinions on readers, Skyhorse manages to comment on a number of hot-button topics, such as immigration, gentrification, and jobs, and effectively raise people's awareness. Overall, I thought The Madonnas of Echo Park was a wonderful novel because it transported me into a world from seven different passageways (distinct lives), and incorporated a number of social issues I am curious and passionate about. Favorite quotes: \u201cThere were many bosses to practice my English on, and while I\u2019d never command the language the way my daughter would, I could speak it as well as a man making a promise \u2013 that is, with equal doses of earnestness and desperation, along with enough wiggle room to escape out of a commitment by feigning a misunderstanding,\u201d (Skyhorse 52).\u201cFaith is a luxury for those who are able to ignore what the rest of us must see everyday,\u201d (Skyhorse 156)."}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1854572-toni", "userReview": "I have been talking a lot about this book at work because it just excites me. One of the marketing blurbs about it that I read said that it will do for Mexican-Americans what Junot Diaz's The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (which I LOVED) did for Dominican-Americans. What that means is that there isn't a lot of mainstream fiction that displays the lives of the various ethnic communities in this country. Especially of the non-white ones.What makes this book special is the author's note at the beginning that explains the childhood incident that provoked Skyhorse to write these stories. It is brilliant and that's all I will say about that.The Madonnas of Echo Park is a collection of related, intertwined short stories that follow the lives of the Mexican residents of this neighborhood, a community in Los Angeles. Yes, there are day-laborers, maids and bus drivers, but, like the neighborhoods we all live in, their lives and motivations are diverse. The one event that all of this revolves around is the accidental murder of a toddler in front of the local corner store.The first line sets the tone - We slipped into this country like thieves, onto the land that once was ours.I'm going to say this word again, Brilliant.

The bookcover says The Madonnas of Echo Park A Novel, but in this case I think the A Novel add-on is subjective. It's really a collection of short stories at most, and in my opinion it's probably not even quite that. Each chapter is written from a different character's POV, but each chapter is not a full story, short or otherwise. Each character may or may not have some connection to another chapter's character, however slight it may be. I realize this is starting to sound like I despised the book but that's not completely true. Some of the chapters were interesting. In fact, some of the chapters were good enough for me to rate 3.5 or 4 stars if the book would have ended up having a story in it. Apparently some people think the story was written in a similar style as the movie Crash, and I can see how they could think that, because each character usually related to someone else in the book in some way, but from what I remember of Crash all the seemingly unrelated characters ended up coming together to play a part in an actual story with a climax (symbolic and literal crash) and with a point to the story. I didn't feel that way with The Madonnas of Echo Park. I felt like it didn't really matter that one character dated another character's former best friend because there was no real revelation or meaning behind connecting them. Generally it didn't even improve either story either. And the same goes for most of the other characters' connections. What was apparent was that the author wanted to show the evolution of a location: the Echo Park (and Chavez Ravine) neighborhood of LA, and how that evolution effected the Mexican immigrants who lived there. It is literally just about the Mexican immigrants, though. At certain points he acknowledges that not only Mexicans inhabit this area, but all his characters are Mexican. The author did a decent job at showing this evolution through his different characters' voices. Not only that, but once I realized that every new chapter meant a new POV I thought he did a decent job at creating a distinct and realistic voice for some of the characters too, be them younger, older, male, or female. The book starts off with a long author's note that made me think of something interesting. He talks about how he did something bad to one of his classmates and he wanted to apologize to her but he was never able to because she didn't return to school after their holiday break. It was what he felt about what he did that struck me as interesting. He apparently felt a cultural and socioeconomic divide with his other classmates. He got MTV before everyone else and therefore was exposed to English and American pop music when most of his other classmates were still listening to Spanish music or old music. When his class decided to have a dance he didn't want to look too uppity so he brought a single of something, I don't remember what, but one of the girls, Aurora, brought Madonna's full album. She was the first to put her's on and she put on Borderline, which was apparently a huge deal in LA at the time because of the video or something having a chola vibe to it. Well, I guess what happened was, he was expected to dance with her by the teacher or something, but he didn't think that was a good idea. The music was starting and they were in place but instead of dancing with her he said, \"I can't dance with you because you're Mexican.\" She was apparently speechless or something and why not, because some kid, who is also Mexican, btw, just told her she wasn't good enough to dance with not because he didn't like her but because of something she could do nothing about, her ethnicity. Too bad she didn't think to say, And what the hell do you think you are??? But honestly, I kinda related to his story. I lived in Signal Hill in Long Beach (about as close to LA is it gets as far as I know) for a few years growing up from about the age of 7 to 9 or so. And the school I went to was dominantly black and white with a few token latinos and asians. My brother and I being two of about four or five of noticably latino decent (we're half and halfers.) Anyway, what I'm getting at is that for some reason at this point in my life I didn't realize I was any different from whoever I was with at any given time. If I was talking to one of my black friends I thought I was the same as her, if I was with one of my white friends I thought I was just like her. I truly didn't realize we were different. And at some point during third grade I realized I didn't look like my mom. So I asked her, \"Why don't I look like you?\" She asked me what I meant and I said, \"Why is my skin darker than yours?\" And do you know what she told me? She said, because you're tanned. (!) Because I was outside all the time. (!) And so I said, \"Well I'm gonna stay inside then because I wanna look like you!\" (I was so sincere too!) We kept talking about it some more, but I find this so funny and outrageous now! But the point is, I didn't realize I was Latina either. Unlike the author, though, I was never told that I was better than any other ethnic group, thank goodness. The funny thing is, my mom was right! My skin really was that color because I was tanned! Now my skin is really not much different than my mom's except it has an olive tone to her peachy one, but if you put our hands side by side the color shade is very, very close. All my other features are very ethnic though :)."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/630958-jenny", "userReview": "This review is full of spoilers, so just a heads up, in case you want to read it.

So it took me a minute to figure out that there are common characters weaving through the chapters; each chapter has a different narrator. Some were more compelling than others. I would say that overall it's a great read, in that aching, sad but beautiful kind of way. But beware there's some pretty graphic violence in it seemed like every chapter. Some of the scenes that were memorable: when Aurora goes back to her Mom's house to help her clean, and she's cleaning their family pictures on the mantel. Back in high school, her Mom had taken a scissors and cut her father out of all the pictures. \"That jagged space where my father used to be never looked right. When I was in high school, I overlaid Morrissey's image from glossy magazines into shots where my mother was holding on to a headless neck or kissing a crisp rip in front of a a tree that had been sliced in half. I pasted in Morrissey's picture because he was the kind of man who would never leave my mother, or abandon a child. His songs contain stories of endless devotion and his incapability of being loved by anyone. Why not give him, then, to someone who no longer had anyone to give her love to? Judging from these photos, Morrissey was a better father than my own was.\" (p 155)Or when the Virgin Mary appears to the lonely older woman Beatriz: \"There in the doorway of a block-long ninety-nine-cent store stood a shiny-faced teenage girl in ankle-length blue slacks and a matching blue coat spotted with a constellation of translucent stars, flat nurse's shoes, a red scarf wrapped around her head in the shape of a circlet to protect her fair skin from the sun, and a white lamb's-wool sweater with a fraying ring of delicate gold thread across her chest. There was nothing remarkable about her clothes--you'd find them at las tiendas descuentas up and down the block--but a young woman wearing such an old lady's outfit?... Plus it was a Tuesday--nobody's idea of a holy day. When I turned to look, she was walking alongside me, a beatific smile on her face, one that for a moment made me forget my wariness of strangers, the only people I mistrust more than my relatives.\" (p 60)Some other quotes:--\"Cons make the best letter writers because inside every man is a poet. You just have to throw him in jail to find it.\" (p 112)--About new friendships: \"That wasn't me, so we stopped hanging out. It's okay, though, because you need to change your friends once in a while. That's how you become the person you're meant to be... the moment that pushes your friendship into something deeper, from friend to best friend, can't be seen when it's happening.\" (p 132-133)"}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/623075-ed", "userReview": "While I certainly enjoyed the book on its own merits, I found myself immediately comparing, mostly positively, vs. other novels... the coincidental (or magical) intersecting of lives recalled Let The Great World Spin... the authentic ethnic voice and edge was quite reminiscent of The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao... and the nostalgia factor of the 1980s and a very particular place (also from a non-white perspective) made me think of Sag Harbor. While I know that's not terribly helpful if you have not read those books, I'm guessing there is a good chance as all these books do seem to orbit in the same \"Customers Who Bought This Also Bought...\" universe. Skyhorse brilliantly kicks things off with an author's note, recalling an episode for his youth that inspired, or perhaps more accurately haunted, him into writing this debut novel. The result is not only a love letter (though not often a pretty one) to his home, the ever-evolving Los Angeles neighborhood of Echo Park, but an attempt at some personal redemption. If that doesn't do it for you, it is hard not to be wow'd, particularly with the current contentiousness re: immigration, by the novel's opening line (\"We slipped into this country like thieves, onto the land that once was ours.\") as readers begin this journey of jumping in and out of the lives of the Mexican-Americans and American-Mexicans.As for (mild) criticism, and with books/novels of this nature in general, a consistent quality from story to story is pretty much impossible to maintain. I thought many of the stories were truly great, while others were \"good.\" As with Let The Great World Spin, a lot also rides on one's tolerance of happenstance, with Skyhorse tending to throw a twist at the end story/chapter. It's a bit of a literary tightrope walk and while I never felt he faltered, there were a few balance checks along the way. Lastly, since you don't have the full (or at least a more complete) picture until the end, this novel certainly would benefit from a re-reading, but who has time for that! But overall, a quite compelling and impressive debut."}, {"userName": "Ted Guevara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20542047-ted-guevara", "userReview": "I have officially read a rejuvenated John Updike in The Madonnas of Echo Park. I\u2019ve long followed such fluency throughout my life and career, and now it protrudes its head again in an ethnically-bound novel. Though the book is divided in eight compartments (plus the pulse of the story which is \u201cAuthor\u2019s Note\")\u2014or maybe they\u2019re apartments where the windows are jacaranda blossom-colored through the eyes of the deeply smitten reader\u2014the links between them are expressively cool, subtle. The language is erudite, eclectic prose; mainstream to those who passionately crave such poetry.There is milieu in Echo Park, California. Its portrayed residents\u2014a homely housekeeper, her outgoing daughter, Aurora, a father struggling to make ends meet while avoiding deportation, and other teenaged girls who seem to mark places up the range of Americanization\u2014are cornered in familiar situations that put a strain on a standard culture. One can ticket a drive-by shooting as far worse than choosing who to kick out from a bus to avoid mob upheaval. But that choice still depends on majority, not on right and wrong. Message to the human condition is flung when the bus driver gets off and meets a hypersensitive allegiance to race anyway. This is existentialism in Echo Park, one that cannot be escaped even through stained glass.I have my own ordeal in labeling characters; I do not. The author here is more of a realist and do. It is perhaps pragmatic for him to describe because this is where he grew up and how. Deal with it and confront the imperfection with the musical flow of his narrative. Yes, and that Madonna reference, that could only be hoisted from that once ever-changing image of her, from what is stagnant in Echo Park\u2014the struggles and pains of a variegated group still trying to avoid the label \u201cdisplaced.\u201dI\u2019ve read a lot of Updike.

(I think Brando Skyhorse may be one of the coolest names I've ever heard for an author.) The characters in Skyhorse's stories are Mexican-Americans of varying ages who are trying to fit in with or rebel against their culture and their neighborhood. Many of the characters are the types of people we pass by every day\u2014cleaning women, bus drivers, day laborers, ex-convicts and teenagers\u2014but Skyhorse brings each to life by wrapping us up in their stories. There's Felicia, who finds herself cleaning house for a family more damaged than she bargained for; Angie, who is reminiscing about her life-changing, fractious relationship with her teenage best friend; Efren, a bus driver who has always prided himself on his staunch devotion to rules and regulations, until one night; Hector, a migrant worker who is forced into covering up a murder; and many others. Some of the stories in this collection truly moved me, some intrigued me and all but one compelled me to keep reading. Skyhorse created some complicated, multi-layered characters; even when they fall closer to stereotypes, I still found myself invested in what was happening to them. I never felt as if the way he connected the stories was too forced; at times, when I recognized the connections I was even a bit surprised (and even awed, once or twice). I look forward to seeing what comes next in his career, and I definitely recommend this book if you enjoy short stories."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1201211-kim", "userReview": "[after finishing reading the book, I read through the book club section at the end and was disturbed to find out that the \"author note\" at the start of the book was actually fake.

Then to find out that it was really just an affectation by the author and fake anyway (signed with \"BS\", how witty, not) - I found that quite irritating. I was glad that it was a fake note, but at the same time really irked that it was even there in the first place. If I hadn't been reading this for work, I probably would have set it aside at the author note and moved onto some other book, thus missing this really interesting and enjoyable read.

Each story relates the struggles of immigrants and first and second generation Mexican Americans and subtlety explores the themes of race, class, and assimilation. Skyhorse opens the world of gangs and drive-bys, day laborers and cleaning ladies, and in turn shows readers how the characters involved in these situations are all striving for love, friendship, and a sense of home. Gritty and realistic the stories are skillfully told with compassion and rare insight into human nature and the complex relationships between lovers, friends, and parents and their children. Filled with music and cinematic imagery each story reads like a complete novel, and yet the various stories fit together like a mosaic to expose a more powerful story when seen as a whole. Readers will delight as they piece together the complex relationships of the characters as they are revealed, and then thrill at Skyhorse\u2019s storytelling genius as the pieces begin to fit together. With much to discuss, from style to content, The Madonnas of Echo Park is a sure fit for book groups and deserves wide readership."}, {"userName": "Kristi Bumpus", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7358780-kristi-bumpus", "userReview": "I actually couldn't finish this book.

But -- and this is completely about me, not the author -- I'm at a place in my life right now where I just couldn't handle all the violence and tragedy.

The characters are interwoven into each other's stories with such calculated but subliminal ease, I'm itching to go back and make a tree for their relationships. Skyhorse really brings Echo Park to life, in all its many stages, from the 80's to the present. I can taste it, smell it, feel it, see it; maybe I love the book so much because I live near the Park, but I feel as though Skyhorse's prose is lively and colorful as well.
