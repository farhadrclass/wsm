The more she talks with him, the stranger he seems. \n\"Mr. Azrael, what line of work are you in?\"\"Oh...well, Human Resources you might say.\"\nThe mysterious man seems friendly - or at the very least, not harmless.

I thought this story was well-written and engaging. I always have trouble getting into short stories (because...well...they're too short!) but this one felt like long story. I had a chance to connect to Eve and Evangelina and they well fleshed out characters.Many short stories I read seem to go with the gut-wrenching, horrible twist at the end but this one really had me pleased with the ending (though, I did feel a bit bittersweet).

There are moments of humour when the Grim Reaper has a cup of tea with a mother & her daughter, but things soon take on a darker & more serious tone. Even the character names show the author's creativity & I look forward to her next work with anticipation."}, {"userName": "Nesly Clerge", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44608269-nesly-clerge", "userReview": "Rebecca McNutt is a young, and extremely talented writer. I was shocked to learn that she wrote this short story in a matter of two days. Eve was anxiously awaiting her husband\u2019s return from a business meeting when an unexpected guest showed up at her door the day before Christmas. The stranger warned Eve that he had some rather gloomy business to conduct. But what did he want? Mr. Azrael told her he was the Grim Reaper and it was time to collect. But collect from whom? Was it Eve? Was it Evangelina her daughter? Was it her husband? While reading the story, I asked myself a question: How would I react to such a stranger? Without divulging the plot, I\u2019ll say this: Evangelina handled the situation appropriately, and as expected, perhaps.The characters are masterfully crafted, and their emotions emanated off the pages. Although short, the story delved into the human psyche; the author gave us the opportunity to explore the psychological characteristics and behavioral traits of humankind. Personally, my favorite character is Evangelina. McNutt gave her range, depth, and demonstrated what a mother\u2019s protective nature is really about. This is a story about love, fear, and sacrifice. A short, sweet, intriguing story, and an easy five stars."}, {"userName": "Eli Connors", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60361348-eli-connors", "userReview": "This is a brilliant story, but if you don't like sad ones you might wish to avoid this because it does have a very upsetting part to it."}, {"userName": "\u2730\u263d\u2665\u2730  Unsolved Mystery \u2730\u2665\u263e\u2730 ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3303677-unsolved-mystery", "userReview": "My rating: 4.5A young girl (and her Mother) are anxiously awaiting the arrival of her father one cold blustery December night.

Perfect Little Angel is identified as a \"Christmas\" story, but I disagree with categorizing it as such. It may be a semantic difference but for me an important one. The story is set at Christmas but is not really dealing with Christmas themes. Meaning basically that Perfect Little Angel is a good read at any time of year and should not be pigeonholed as a story to be read only during the Christmas season. The author deals with some heavy cosmic questions here; fate, destiny, karma (though not specifically stated), and duty. Ms. McNutt takes the reader on a surreal ride with predominantly the mother of the Perfect Little Angel and a very scary visitor. Perfect Little Angel is very short, but packs a lot of story into relatively few pages (an apparent trademark of this author), no fluff, no fill, just riveting story with twists worthy of The Twilight Zone. If it takes calling Perfect Little Angel a Christmas story to entice you to read it, so be it, but I will say don't think of it only in that context. It is an awesome story any time of year. Check out Rebecca McNutt and Perfect Little Angel. Enjoy!Mike"}, {"userName": "Mattie Spears", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62301928-mattie-spears", "userReview": "Snagged a free copy from the author and boy am I happy that I did!The plot of this story is very straightforward. Eve (surname unknown), a beautiful young mother, is spending the night before Christmas with her angel of a daughter, Evangelina, in their home in an unnamed city as they wait for the patriarch of the family to return from a business meeting. Suddenly there's a knock at the door. Eve discovers that there's a pale-looking man outside on her porch. In a fit of compassion because of the cold weather, she invites him inside and offers him tea. She notices that he looks like he is starving to death, but still he is dressed professionally in a necktie and a black overcoat. The man shows her a great deal of kindness, but soon ends up revealing a disturbing truth - he's the Grim Reaper, and he has arrived to reap Evangelina.Eve is initially terrified and furious, but soon opens up to \"Mr. Azrael\", confessing that a past tragedy has scarred her mentality for life. Death expresses the horrible loneliness and isolation that comes with his job. It's what eventually happens though in a shocking turn of events, which really had me in tears. Ineffable story even though it is a short length, and the characters just make you fall in love with them on each page."}, {"userName": "Jeff Chicken", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61370662-jeff-chicken", "userReview": "I wanna see a movie! That ending, it hits like a two-tonne anvil and I had no idea it would turn out the way it did. I loved the author's use of biblical names for the characters. 'Eve' means life, 'Michael' is an angel, 'Evangelina' also means angel, and I think we all know what 'Azrael' means. A great Christmas story for those who prefer a darker side to the fun and cheer."}, {"userName": "Wanda Raine Hedare", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57499540-wanda-raine-hedare", "userReview": "I was so excited to get an e-copy of this little short story and to be its first reviewer! Anybody who reads Canadian teenage author Rebecca McNutt's work knows that her talent lies in writing supernatural tales akin to old episodes of The Twilight Zone. Her meticulous style and old-fashioned habits make her books almost like classics. Perfect Little Angel is a Christmas story, a supernatural story and a dark fiction story, but ultimately it is a story about the meaning of kindness and how being kind to strangers can reward us when we least expect it. All in all this little story is as captivating as its minimalist front cover artwork. I wasn't expecting the ending to hit me as hard as it did. I adored this book and I can't wait to read her next one!"}, {"userName": "Jaclyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64167594-jaclyn", "userReview": "A big shout-out to the author for sending me a copy!

A lovely dark Christmasy tale with an interesting twist. I am not really a fan of short stories as I like to immerse myself in the characters and get to know them. But I love to support Canadian authors and to find talent in such a young new author is a bonus! I see great things coming from Rebecca. This story had a lot of levels to it. A twist on biblical lore, the failings in parenthood, the all-encompassing love of a parent, the struggling of trying to do right in a grey world, the nostalgia of Christmas, the empathy of one person to another despite what it costs them.........all in less than 20 pages is a definite winner. Rebecca is quite good in her descriptions and building ambiance.
