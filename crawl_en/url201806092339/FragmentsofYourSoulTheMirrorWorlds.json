Its so beautiful..I have always had a thing for Loki\u2764..It took me a very long time to find this book and I was very excited to finally be reading it..To be honest, I felt like this book was very slow paced..Since Loki doesnt really show up a lot throughout the first half of the book, at times I got really bored..The second half of the book on the other hand, had so many Loki moments, and I couldnt put it down (:The ending was beautiful!!\u2764Loki deserves some love..I LOVE THIS BOOK.."}, {"userName": "mirba", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2330558-mirba", "userReview": "First of all the cover. It is just amazing. The best cover ever, but this is not a book to read just for the romance.The story itself is good, even if it takes a little while to get into it properly. The character herself takes a little time to be loved, she starts as a good for nothing uninteresting and becomes more strong and more interesting to follow during her travels, not just because she discover her \"powers\" but because she grows and suffers and that changes her. I love when characters do thatLoki is... really Loki. So you will want to strangle him for 80% of the book, kill him painfully for the rest but still you will fall in love with him somehow."}, {"userName": "Veronica Snaccache Baker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32560546-veronica-snaccache-baker", "userReview": "Super Recommended !! / Super Recomendo The writing is well-tied, fluid and engaging story.

There's a line in it that very much applies to this book, \"maybe it's a lunatic you're looking for...\" No need to turn off the lights, the world they're in is of Shadows, but Arvid will do her best to save Loke, anyways. Arvid falls through a shimmer of air into the Shadow World. It is both as ominous, and not as ominous as it sounds. Demonic beasts chase her but humanity here is more cohesive than her home in the Light World. After landing, naked, in this new world she is rescued by another hapless human who dropped in over a decade before her. This world has gods, small g, that have abilities but aren't the immortal deities known in theology/mythology here on Earth. While they are in charge, they aren't omnipotent, just more like fuedal Lords and Ladies with some fancy magic tricks. Well, a prophecy about a dark haired female human proceeds Arvid's arrival so the gods decidento shuffle her off to a distant farm to \"keep her out of trouble\". Although that plot turns out darker than she first realizes as she sees the horrors that occur there. Green Acres it ain't. After escaping that little slice of hell she eacapes to the city, where her previous rescuer attends classes to have her fate changed. At this point Arvid isn't sure what's going on but she's not been too happy with the \"generosity\" shown her so far. Godly experiments that result in human transplants, blind human obedience to these gods, the farm that made little patricidal children in corn fields seem like a comedic holiday and then the oaf that sent her the note that had her packed off to the not so fun farm is arguing with her about how she should be happy that the gods are willing to provide for her? Doesn't add up to an amenable Arvid. As she argues a new voice pops up and offers her help. The only process he asks is a, undecided as yet, favor in the future. While not particularly enjoying the Godfather-esque ominous tones of it, she lacks a way to decline. In return this new god is willing to provide for her housing, education and clothing. It really is an offer she can't refuse. But, the classes teach her the new language she needs to read and speak, about the powers people can posses here, the history of this world, and maybe if she can discover it, a way back home. So, off to college she goes. While discovering that she is a white mage (can work light) new faces pop up and present challenges. And her benefactor shows his face, too. But when Odin gets antsy about that prophecy things get really crazy. I love books about mythology. True to form or rewritten, I enjoy the read. This presented a slightly different slant on Norse mythology and the deities and beings of that culture. The start up was slow but once all the dominoes starting falling it moved quickly. Our leading lady was fierce, maybe a bit violent but I'm not opposed. The leading male was fractured and sometimes spiteful, but true to his mythological self. The god of lies and chaos isn't going to have an easy story and he suffers in this book. While it is a great read, and has an HEA, it isn't rainbows and sunshine. This story takes place in a world of darkness and the story reflects that. But it is a very good book and I'm excited to see where this author takes us next. And the artwork that goes with this story is stunning. Look it up on social media."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11425610-melissa", "userReview": "See my other reviews at Never Enough BooksSince the death of her father, Arvid Bergen has worked hard to support herself and her mother. When she accidentally steps through a portal that leads to another world, her only thought is returning home. While she is told the task is incredibly unlikely, if not impossible, Arvid is undeterred.Upon meeting the god Loke, she strikes a bargain with him. Too late she learns that Loke is a liar and a traitor, and one she should not trust. Still, Arvid is determined to get home one way or another, even if it means pairing up with a murderer.I will be honest, dear reader, I was first drawn to Fragments of Your Soul because of the artwork. When I joined Tumblr, I saw some of Eleathyra\u2019s artwork for the book and was intrigued. And while I eventually was able to obtain a copy of the book, it has only been recently that I was able to sit and read it.With that out of the way, it breaks my heart to say that I did not enjoy this book. I tried so very hard to like it, but there were several times I nearly threw my e-reader across the room in anger and frustration.Firstly, the English translation from the original German isn\u2019t that good. There are times when the dialogue feels awkward and the action is at times clunky. It is also a rather long book, the Kindle edition I read was just over 400 pages. Unfortunately, this means that at times the story becomes kind of boring. There were times I had to force myself to continue just to find out what happened next.Next, the characters. Arvid is a young woman in her mid-twenties, and like most her age she works a job she doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy and has a strained relationship with her mother. She has anger issues which resulted in a broken hand at the opening of the book, and continues throughout the story. She also has a bit of a superiority complex, her way of thinking sometimes tends to follow the \u201cmy way is the only way\u201d, especially when she is met with servants or those who are considered lesser than. When she inevitably tries to persuade them to rise up or act different, she is frustrated when they refuse. She seems unable to understand that just because she thinks one way, not every one around her does.Loke is another character that quite honestly I did not like. He is cruel and manipulative, and a times even verbally abusive; not just to Arvid but to other characters around him. His past is used as an attempt to explain and even excuse his behavior and the love that Arvid develops for him somehow makes him a better man as if by magic. This, unfortunately, is a trope that has been used too often recently and with little to no success.While Erbsland does an excellent job of building a world based on Norse mythology, an interesting world itself does not a good story make. There must be equally interesting characters; characters we develop feelings for and root for. Alas, while we have the first in Fragments of Your Soul, the second is severely lacking. I\u2019m afraid I simply cannot recommend this one to my readers. Instead, I encourage them to head over to Eleathrya\u2019s art page, enjoy the pictures there and make up their own stories."}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71083342-chelsea", "userReview": "This book felt a bit like pulling teeth starting out, it\u2019s very slow to start and personally I didn\u2019t find ANY of the characters particularly likable. They do grow on you over time as they grow and change. I started really enjoying the story around the 70% mark and only wished the rest of the story had been more like it. I understand that adversity is a good tool in storytelling, it\u2019s just that I can see some people abandoning the book because there isn\u2019t a lot of joy in the first half.

Purtroppo mi \u00e8 caduto sul finale prevedibile, ma pazienza.Arvid si ritrova in un mondo parallelo, dopo essere stata risucchiata da un portale. Conosce varie persone, che l'aiutano ad ambientarsi a usi e costumi totalmente differenti dai suoi. Un giorno, secondo quanto riportato da una missiva da parte degli Asi di Asgard, deve lasciare quel posto e trasferirsi altrove. Dopo alcuni mesi, riesce ad avere un udienza con uno di loro: spiega che vorrebbe tornare nel suo mondo e che la colpa \u00e8 solo loro se lei si trova l\u00ec; insomma la discussione degenera e quando sta per essere colpita da un manrovescio, succede qualcosa, che non \u00e8 sfuggita all'altro uomo, che \u00e8 rimasto nell'ombra per tutto il tempo. Sto parlando del mitico Loki. Interessato ad Arvid, gli concede il suo aiuto, scendendo per\u00f2 a compromessi (come \u00e8 ovvio XD) e la protagonista si ritrova coinvolta in antichi contenziosi ancora aperti. (Poraccia)Trama classica ma libera dalla cultura pop. Infatti, la caratterizzazione di Loki si rifa solo alla mitologia.

I think this book suffered from a not great translation from German. The sentence structure was clunky, the word choice strange, and a general lack of appropriate pacing. I enjoyed the world building very much, and that was what disappointed me most with this book. It could have been SO much more. I eventually liked the main character, though at the start of the book she was whiny and became overly angry about the majority of things happening to her. I didn't find Loke particularly likable through most of the book, and then when all of a sudden she \"loves\" him, they have sex and of course she conceives immediately. Um, what?
