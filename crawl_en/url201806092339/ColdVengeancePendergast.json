It's not that it's badly written, but the authors are really starting to move Pendergast's character and plot lines into the conspiracy theory thriller genre. While I love a good conspiracy thriller, what I loved about Pendergast was the archeology, science, museum settings, New York City and New Orleans settings and Holmesian feel.None of that is evident in the new Pendergast. He even goes so far as to make multiple glaring mistakes (and frankly the mistakes are predictable plot points, maybe that's his problem) that he mocks himself for. He's all over the world, hunting stags in a marsh, finding a World War II Nazi conspiracy and shooting half a dozen men on a boat with magically placed gymnastics and bullets and other feats of spy thriller action rather than his previous Holmesian and seemingly magical insights into human habit, psychology and history. And I know I should be for character development, but I want smart Pendergast back...not good shot Pendergast.One thing I was super happy to see is that they brought back Corrie Swanson from Still Life with Crows. She's probably one of my favorite characters in the series and I've been wondering about her. Constance is also back, as well as a continuance of the characters picked up in Cold Fever.I was also irritated that this book is set up as a cliffhanger, for no particularly good reason. The book isn't that long and not that much happens in it beyond a hunting accident and the aforementioned slaughter on the boat. It's complete exposition, with far too much inner monologue, apparently to set up for what I hope is a thrilling finale. But there's nothing in here that demanded such time or explanation that it couldn't have been a completed story.I had hoped with Gideon's Sword getting their apparent penchant for action adventure/conspiracy thrillers out of their systems, that the two authors would return Pendergast to his New York City or New Orleans history settings and deal with the urban monsters that thrilled me so much in the beginning. Apparently, that isn't going to happen anytime soon. I'm ready for this particular trilogy to be over."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "[ (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "[ Okay, small hint.

Not just angry......really really really angry. And out for justice, with a shot of revenge. In the first novel in the Helen Pendergast trilogy (within the Pendergast series), he discovered new evidence in the death of his wife in a lion attack several years before. He swore he would find out who was behind her murder and avenge her. In Cold Vengeance, Pendergast not only discovers that the conspiracy is so much more diabolical and depraved than he thought, but he also discovers that Helen might still be alive.This book really seems like a bridge between the first novel that introduced Helen and the plot behind her death and the last novel that I'm sure will wrap up the story in a grandiose Pendergastian way. I enjoyed the chase (some of the action scenes were just awesome and there are some great lines by Pendergast in this story), but the weak cliffhanger ending I just really didn't like. I'm a bit tired of the Helen story line, to be honest. I miss the weird cases that lead Pendergast to out of the way dusty museums and archaeological sites. I prefer the somehow distant and reserved Pendergast to this overly emotional, out for revenge version. BUT.....despite my eye roll at the end of the book, this is a good story. There is plenty of action....plenty of bad guys to hate....and enough mystery to the situation to keep it interesting. I will be glad to read through the next book and have the Helen mystery solved so the series can move on to something else. Not that I blame Pendergast for being pissed off that someone killed (or pretended to kill) his wife.....but the overly emotional, almost broken Pendergast is more creepy than his normal strange self. Just a weird vibe to the Helen story-line books. The Constance Green story angle is getting a bit weird also....I hope that gets resolved in the next book or two as well.I listened to the audiobook version of this book. Rene Auberjonois narrates again. I like his reading pace and his voice. Plus I think he does a really good accent for the Pendergast character. I have partial hearing loss, and never have any problem understanding him. The audiobook is unabridged and just under 12 hours long. Good quality. Very enjoyable.Cold Vengeance is the 11th book in the Pendergast series. There are 16 books currently, and a 17th coming out in 2018.For more information on the authors and their books, check out their website: http://www.prestonchild.com/"}, {"userName": "L-J Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3633137-l-j-johnson", "userReview": "What have they done to Pendergast?!? I'm not liking this stereotypical action stud the authors are turning him into. Where are the strange mysteries, haunted hallways of museums, Pendergast's both cerebral and mystical take on the world? And that this particular storyline - Pendergast investigating his wife's accidental death/murder/disappearance from 12 years prior - is going to take three books is just ridiculous! I'm tired of novels just stopping, with no ending at all. This wasn't that long of a book; this easily could have been brought to a real conclusion. And this certainly isn't a compelling enough story to warrant three novels, probably 1100 pages total, and a wait of a year or more for book #3! They brought back Corrie, a beloved character from the miles superior Still Life with Crows, and gave her almost nothing to do. Enough's enough, guys. Get this silly Nazi conspiracy story out of your system, stop having Pendergast act like he's in a Bourne movie, and go back to the much richer, interesting and unique stories you used to write."}, {"userName": "Mihir", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229652-mihir", "userReview": "Original review over at Fantasy Book Critic OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: Cold Vengeance is the second book in the Helen Pendergast trilogy that began with Fever Dream last year. I very much enjoyed the new twist envisioned by the authors as Pendergast begins to re-examine his past and find out about his wife. This move was a brilliant one by the authors and Fever Dream rekindled many a jaded fan back into Pendergast\u2019s throes.This book begins almost immediately after the events of the last book. Pendergast has gone hunting with his brother-in-law Judson Esterhazy, things soon go awry and Pendergast is forced to go underground perhaps a second time in his life (the first time was around the events of the Diogenes trilogy). For things are definitely what they seem and this time around even the ever-doughty Vincent D\u2019Agosta can\u2019t be of much help. Things soon take a turn for the unexpected as Corrie Swanson begins her investigation into Pendergast\u2019s absence. Aiding her in cause is Vincent D\u2019Agosta who is slowly recovering from the events of the previous title. On a separate track Ned Betterton is a investigative reporter who fills in the void left by Bill Smithback in Preston-Child world and lastly there is the continuation of Constance\u2019s storyline from the events of the previous few books and we get a viewpoint from Dr. John Felder which helps the reader in knowing more of what is developing.Thus with such a convoluted storyline, the authors plunge the readers into a morass of storylines wherein nothing is as it seems and Pendergast is even more bewildered than he was shown in the previous volume. The basic storyline is about Helen Pendergast, the long-thought-to-be dead wife of agent Pendergast, however things and plots have been unearthed which make it seem that Helen was murdered and did not die in a hunting accident. This book not only validates that theory but pushes forward a new one which will further shock Pendergast as well as the readers.The authors have to be congratulated for not only twisting the reader\u2019s perceptions but also backing it up with a tremendous story which does not stop shocking the reader while maintaining its pace and potential. This story\u2019s pace is one which does not allow any time for the reader to pause and collect their thoughts as it carries the reader forward through out. The re-appearance of fan-favorite characters of Corrie Swanson & Vincent D\u2019Agosta further helps in engaging the reader as Pendergast is not often present on the scene of action. It\u2019s very difficult to discuss the details of the plot as even the smallest points are spoiler-ish and therefore its best if the readers themselves come across these points in their reading journey. Among the book\u2019s finer facets are the side plots, which do not detract any attention from the main plot and keep the readers, further engrossed in trying to figure out how it will all end?The most surprising thing of the book is how assured the authors seem to be in an environment wherein their comfort level is at its zenith, earlier this year the same duo had released Gideon\u2019s Sword and its very hard to believe that both the books were written by the same people in almost an overlapping time period. The difference between both books is startling in terms of plot, characterization and plot twists and is unfathomable. Another remarkable aspect of this book is that even though this is the middle book of the trilogy, it does not show any such signs. It rushes towards the climax while keeping the reader guessing and goes on to deliver not one but two explosive revelations which will have massive repercussions in Pendergast\u2019s world.This book does not get any better than the pervious excellent thrillers like Reliquary, Cabinet of Curiosities, Riptide, etc. from these virtuoso masters. Not only will it invigorate the series but will go on to gain more fans for the series as many readers who haven\u2019t read the previous series titles can readily start reading the books from Fever Dream and thus will still be enchanted by the world and the characters created by Messrs. Preston & Child.CONCLUSION: An excellent thriller, \"The Dark Knight\" to its predecessor and an out-and-out page-turner. Preston & Child have written a fiendishly clever book and inserted enough surprises in it to flummox the most veteran readers and with an ending even more devious than all their previous ones; next year cannot come soon enough for the final book and the resolution to the mystery of Helen Pendergast."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma", "userReview": "Brilliant!

Somehow in the last few books, Pendergast has slowly switched from being an intellectual type who is a marksman, to being Mitch Rapp. I find that this is slowly reducing the appeal of this series since it seeks to compete in a genre where there are much better ones available. I come to Pendergast because it is creepy and there is a mystery to be solved, not because I want to read about the antics of an unstoppable machine.Other than this gripe, the other essentials still remain. The writing is excellent with some great humour.

Like Corrie Swanson from Still Life With Crows, I too shared an admiration for the elusive FBI agent. However, through the series he has grown from an aloof and scrupulously scientific investigator to a man very nearly teetering on the edge of whatever is left of his sanity. FEVER DREAM began the epic journey deeper into Pendergast's psyche as he realized his wife, Helen, was not accidentally killed, but in fact murdered, and COLD VENGEANCE follows through as horrifying discoveries are made concerning her past: that she may have set up her own murder and, in fact, might not be dead. Pendergast's once severely controlled actions begin to spiral and he his warned by friends about his own past. \"Consider your family history\" echoes throughout these pages implying that Pendergast has the potential to live up to the same misdeeds as the more psychotic members of the infamous family. After reading these two books, a dark and sinister Pendergast is not all that hard to imagine. There are many moments in each book of the Helen trilogy where I've wanted to turn back, not gaze into the eyes of the beast Pendergast is becoming, but I've been with him this long, and I can't leave him. And like the loyal Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta who has been with the FBI agent through thick and thin, I follow Pendergast through the mire in the hopes he finds the answers to his questions, and perhaps a light at the end of the tunnel. Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child have outdone themselves once again, and with COLD VENGEANCE at the #1 spot on the New York Times Bestseller list, it's proof this is without a doubt the best in the entire series.

Depending on where their novels are set, and how much time is spent mountain climbing or in subterranean caverns, there will be varying amounts of susurrus and fingers scrabbling for purchase. Here we have only one \"low susurrus of wind\" and one set of feet finding a purchase aboard a yacht. But we do have two instances of fingers being tented: Dr. Felder, Constance's psychiatrist, \"tented his fingers.\" Pendergast even takes the time to tent his fingers after his ward Constance has been kidnapped, in order to ponder where she might be. I don't understand why anyone would calmly tent their fingers when lives are at stake and time is of the essence, but then Pendergast is an FBI agent of a different stripe. Tenting signals the thinking professions; in books you won't see a stevedore tent his fingers, or a nanny. Because it is associated with thinking and contemplation, it is of course gendered. \"Tented his fingers\" and \"tenting his fingers\" produce 6,010 googlebooks results. \"Tented her fingers\" and \"tenting her fingers\" produce 1,511 results.As we have seen before, Pendergast is not one to manspread. Over the course of two pages, Pendergast \"crossed one leg delicately over the other.\" Not pausing to uncross them, on the very next page he \"crossed his legs.\" A mere eight lines later he \"recrossed his legs.\" So he crossed his newly crossed legs over the previously crossed legs? Because what I'm picturing is some kind of double pretzel. On a later page he is seen \"throwing one leg over the other\", whether delicately, or athletically, the authors don't say."}, {"userName": "Michael Knudsen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3221939-michael-knudsen", "userReview": "Special Agent Pendergast is one of my favorite characters in contemporary fiction. So here's why Cold Vengeance only gets 3 stars: This is the first of this particular cycle of novels that really feels like just an installment. Not only do you KNOW you're not going to get a decent resolution to this book, but you know it from the beginning. This would be fine if you're lucky enough to be reading the whole series after its publication, but argh, this is one of those cliffhangers we readers could have done without. Sadly, this book feels padded and it reeks of P & C cashing in. Also, our hero is not at his resourceful and intrepid best. Obsessed with tracking down the ultimate fate of his (supposedly) deceased wife, his mind is a little muddled and he makes some serious mistakes that his enemies capitalize on. Sure, this helps extend the story, but it's just not as fun as when Pendergast is at the height of his powers, physically and mentally. For the first third of the novel we don't even know where he is after Esterhazy shoots him. Sure, the sequence on the yacht is vintage Pendergast, but I could have used a bit more of that in this book. And finally, am I just noticing this now, or is Pendergast hardly ever the point-of-view character in these novels anymore? It seems most of the story is told from the viewpoint of other characters, which in my mind weakens the fictional presence of our hero. I'd like to spend more time inside that incredible brain!

This reads like someone shoved these two men in a room with a typewriter and forced them to churn out a book.Its a much slower read than their previous novels. Its better than Brimstone which in my opinion could have removed all the New York filler after Pendergast and D'Agosta left for Italy and been a damn sight better. Cold Vengeance didn't become a page turner until I was more than 70% through it. I kept reading because I love Pendergast. It non-ended horribly leaving you with more questions than it answered. I say non-ended because my copy seems to be missing the page with 'To Be Continued...' on it.I don't plan on reading this one again, but I'll keep reading Pendergast novels as they are published because Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child have created one of my ultimate favorite literary characters even if he seems a bit unhinged in his latest book."}, {"userName": "J.K.

Now he\u2019s out for answers and even vengeance, and the trail leads him to some nasty surprises.While I enjoyed this novel quite a bit, I\u2019m not sure I like the way Pendergast seems to be evolving. I thought his character from the earlier books was unique, especially considering his rather bizarre personal appearance and his amazing cerebral powers. Now it seems he is evolving into a more rounded action figure, more prone to act with emotion than with his fascinating but curiously thoughtful approach he\u2019s shown before. The last thing I want to see is Pendergast turn into some sort of stock hero character like you find in so many mainstream thriller novels. Perhaps it is just this sub-trilogy concerning his wife Helen that is bringing that behavior out in him but I hope that once the next book is concluded we see a return to the sort of plots from the early part of the series.Having said that, I must say this book is still a great ride. The authors certainly know how to keep the pages turning and I do like the deepening mysteries of the Pendergast family\u2019s past that are starting to be revealed. The character of Constance (Pendergast\u2019s ward) always seemed odd to me but now we are getting a much clearer picture of who she is and what her role is.

I find that I am now again eager to read another Preston Child book, when before I was a little uninspired. At least some ends are being tied up and questions answered. I do however, look forward to the day when Pendergast and Vincent are on their own, investigating some new horror that isn't easily explained away and has some mystery involved.

Sure, he's a fabulously wealthy and preternaturally clever FBI agent (well, he carries the badge but sometimes seems to have the same relationship to the FBI as Sam and Dean Winchester), but the drama! The angst! His brother was a psychopath, a malevolent genius! His wife was eaten by a lion! Or was she ...?Here's the thing. Once upon a time, Preston & Child wrote a book called Relic. It was set in a giant, creepy New York museum and involved a monster in said museum eating people. The museum was so well-defined and atmospheric it was almost, itself, a character. Another character in the book -- not one of the main characters, certainly, was a bizarre FBI agent named Pendergast who arrived mysteriously, did mysterious things and was generally a riddle wrapped in an enigma wearing an impeccably-tailored black suit. And as such, he was remarkably effective -- a wild card they could play to get the other characters out of their current impossible scrape.And then they wrote Reliquary (possibly my favorite of theirs) which moved the action to the endless labyrinth of tunnels under Manhattan and brought back Pendergast, but still not in the lead role.And then over the course of the series, they started bringing him to the forefront, making the books about him. And, to be honest, the series got the weaker for it. Pendergast, like Hannibal Lecter, works best as a secondary character in someone else's story.So now here we are in the middle of another Pendergast-centered trilogy; now he's uncovering terrible secrets about his late(?) wife Helen and pursuing any leads to her true fate with grim, single-minded determination. Naturally, there are betrayals, murders, exquisitely described luxurious apartments and foodstuffs, and a massive cliffhanger of an ending.Let's be completely honest here: These books aren't actually very good -- the plotting varies from intricate to slapdash, the prose is ... serviceable, and the characters are, well, present and accounted for.So why did I read the entire book in the space of four days, and why am I just about to start the next in the series and probably power through it just as fast? Clearly they must be doing something right ..."}, {"userName": "J.F.

Special Agent Pendergast is an awesome hero, perhaps because he is just a bit odd and his family are a bunch of nutters, both living and dead. Pale and interesting with deep knowledge of arcane mystery and unorthodox ways of investigation, Pendergast is the anti-Bond. There is no sexual tension, but a lot of thinking and cleverness which makes for a more interesting story. This is the 11th in the Pendergast books and although not my favourite so far, it still has many aspects that will satisfy fans. I have read all the books and am a fan of the more supernatural themes especially in the Diogenes trilogy, but that storyline is mostly tied up. Although we do hear about Pendergast\u2019s strange ward Constance and her child in this book so there are snippets of past plot threads, but I must warn Pendergast fans, this is definitely not the last book in the series. It ends with another cliffhanger. But onto the review of this specific book. The book opens with a deer hunt in Scotland with Pendergast and his brother in law, Judson Esterhazy. This has some brilliant descriptions and you get a real sense of the remote moors. No time for scenery though as the pair both intend to double-cross the other. Pendergast is desperate to know why Esterhazy murdered Helen, his own sister and Pendergast\u2019s wife. In his turn, Esterhazy wants to silence Pendergast and leaves him to die in a sucking bog with the words that Helen is actually still alive. That sets the scene for the book which is partly about how Pendergast survives and his tracking down of Esterhazy and his investigation of the mysterious Covenant. There is also the kidnapping of Constance from the asylum and the trap set by a team of assassins. Meanwhile, the eclectic friends of Pendergast try to help him, the goth law student Corrie finding top secret Nazi documents along the way. Shades of Mengele, death camps, experimentation on twins and Nazi baddies suggests a Nazi eugenics plot for the next book. Overall, the book is a must for Pendergast fans as it continues the series at a good romping pace, but if you are new to Lincoln & Child then do start at the beginning and work through them. I don\u2019t think you would understand much if you read this with no knowledge of the back story. But I highly recommend them all if you like action-adventure with a (mostly) supernatural twist."}, {"userName": "Kristin  (MyBookishWays Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3491365-kristin-mybookishways-reviews", "userReview": "You may also read my review here: http://www.mybookishways.com/2011/09/...My favorite enigmatic FBI agent,Aloysius Pendergast,is back,and he\u2019s determined to find out what really happened to his wife,Helen,in Africa,where she supposedly died at the jaws of a vicious lion. Cold Vengeance starts off with a bang,with Pendergast on a hunting expedition in Scotland with his brother in law,Judson Esterhazy. Esterhazy tries to do away with Pendergast,but,if you\u2019re familiar with this series,then you know Pendergast is tough to kill,very tough,and it\u2019s going to take more than a silly murder attempt to stop him. When D\u2019Agosta,cop and dear friend to Pendergast,learns of the attempt on his life,he insists on traveling to Scotland to help,and Corrie Swanson (Still Life With Crows),also lends a hand back in New York. Constance Green plays a significant part in this book as well,and there will be revelations about her and her past. Esterhazy isn\u2019t exactly a walk in the park,but we also meet a villain that puts him to shame. Pendergast is single minded in his mission to find out the truth,and he\u2019ll employ all of his cunning and genius to do so. He\u2019s also not afraid to resort to a bit of blackmail to get his way.The authors put Pendergast through the physical ringer in this one,but he bounces back in typical Pendergast fashion,and he\u2019ll stop at nothing to root out the truth. Cold Vengeance is like a big onion,and I had a hell of a time peeling back the layers! The action never stops,and I had a really hard time putting this one down. Most of the Pendergast novels can be read individually,however,you really need to have read Fever Dream to get the most out of Cold Vengeance. There are more twists and turns than you can count,a sadistic villain,secret Nazi groups with shadowy agendas,action galore,and of course,a cast of characters that we\u2019ve grown to love. I\u2019ll drop everything to pick up a Pendergast book,and Cold Vengeance was no exception! I\u2019ll be eagerly awaiting the next book in this wonderful series!"}, {"userName": "Matt Schiariti", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12981352-matt-schiariti", "userReview": "I thought Fever Dream was one of the best Pendergast books to land in a while so I was hoping that Cold Vengeance could at least come close. At first I was a little worried when I saw that on average it rated just above three stars here on amazon but as I got into the book I couldn't put it down.This novel is about 90% Pendergast which to some could either be good or bad. I've seen mention made by some reviewers saying that Pendergast reads best when he's interacting with his, how shall we say, more 'grounded' counterparts. In general I agree but this is THE single most personal story for Pendergast and it's what a second act should be. Some mysteries come to light, more players are involved, more questions raised. I HAD to find out what was written on the next page all the while knowing that I would be left wanting more by the end of the story.Some familiar familiar faces do show up: Corrie Swanson for one (whom I've been hoping to see more of since Still Life With Crowes), the mole like Wren the researcher, and as always the stalwart D'agosta.This is also a little bit of a departure from the normal forensically science heavy Pendergast novels. Pendergast is driven, he's a man on a mission delving into the mystery of his wife's death. As a result there are some pretty prolonged action sequences which you don't always find in a Preston and Child novel. The action is tense and very well written and it makes for a rapid fire read.Pendergast is one of my favorite characters from any type of fiction and I wait with baited breath for the next chapter in the saga!"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine", "userReview": "Chronologically this story picks up a few weeks after the conclusion of \u201cFever Dream\u201d. Aloysius has once again come to grips with his beloved wife\u2019s death and once again feels he has not much to live for. His brother-in-law is more than happy to try and make that particular wish come true. As Pendergast fights for his life we are given glimpses into what really happened to Helen, and could she, really, still be alive?I found this book a bit lacking in the idiosyncrasies that make Pendergast, well \u2026 that make him Pendergast. With only a few mentions of his usual cohorts Aloysius is pretty much alone with his quest in this book. I missed the interaction with other characters, particularly between Aloysius and D\u2019Agosta. We do however find out a little bit more of Constance\u2019s story, which I personally, enjoy.This is the second book of the \u201cHelen Pendergast Trilogy\u201d. And this trilogy resides within the Aloysius Pendergast series. {Preston and Child have done this before with the Cemetery Dance books). Is it just me or is reading getting more and more complicated??? If you are new to the Pendergast series I do strongly encourage you to read the books but it would be difficult to enjoy this one as a stand-alone book. A new reader would, at the very least, need to read Fever Dream first and quite possible go even further back to the Cemetery Dance trilogy."}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3644438-gail", "userReview": "It was nice to have the story line continue with Pendergast and Helen but I felt like not enough happened. Ok, stuff did Happen - but not to really advance that story line. I like that Corrie was included since so many of the \"regulars\" have been killed off. You know how in stories the bad guys always have self inflated egos and underestimate the good guy they have just captured (for the supposed purpose of killing)? Instead of just killing the good guy, the bad guy does face time with him, bragging and giving the hero time to wiggle out of the trap. This happens in this story too, but also the ending is the same when P lets Esterhazy bring Helen to the park. Too many variables (even though with so many people around it is supposed to be \"safer\") - if P really wanted to get H back safely he had many ways and places to do just that. The Dakota for instance. But then the book wouldn't have ended the way it did - leaving it wide open for another book and P trying to find H."}], "description": "Devastated by the discovery that his wife, Helen, was murdered, Special Agent Pendergast must have retribution.
