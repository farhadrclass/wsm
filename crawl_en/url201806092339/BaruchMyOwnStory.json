There was additional information than what was included in the other two books, but there was also information in the other two that wasn't contained in this book.What I found so enticing about this particular volume was the clear, elucidating manner in which he wrote. He not only presented a variety of information, but also he expressed himself in such a way, that I could hear the man talking. His kindness, humanity and logical thought were expressed both in his words and his tone.Best of all for me, he offered sound advice for individuals, organizations and nations.I found the book so interesting and appealing that I had difficulty putting it down. This book, in my opinion, is one that should be read by people of all ages and interests."}, {"userName": "Yixing Jiang", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20269161-yixing-jiang", "userReview": "\u6ca1\u7ec6\u770b\uff0c\u6709\u5e72\u8d27\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u5c31\u4e09\u56db\u9875\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u90fd\u662f\u81ea\u4f20\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u5f55\u3002"}, {"userName": "Sylv C", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59200344-sylv-c", "userReview": "An underrated classic.
