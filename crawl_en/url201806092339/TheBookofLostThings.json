It seems like it could be young adult in tone at first but it is NOT young adult. It's an adult urban fantasy starring a child. Very cool and immersive, and a bit dark. Hell, a LOT dark sometimes, haha. The lore is very cool, you can tell that the author really loves folklore and all the elements of the world are interesting and believable. Worth checking out if you like magical realism and a lot of bite to your fairy tales."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "Rumpelstiltskin\u2026aka \u201cthe Crooked Man\u201d is one seriously scary and diabolical CREEPSTER. \nTrust me, after reading this book, the above image of a sadistic, powerful, child-slaughtering MOFO will forever displace your previous perception of old Rumpy being nothing more than a half pint, mischievous prankster with ethical deficiencies\u2026\n\u2026a Disney tale this is not. \u2026a light, comforting \u201chappily ever after\u201d children\u2019s story this is not. However, what this story is\u2026.is beautifully written, richly characterized and brilliantly executed. Put simply\u2026it\u2019s wheel barrow full of WONDERFUL. My feelings for this book surprised me after my intensely passionate, torrid love affair with The Child Thief. I sort of felt bad for this book as I really thought it had no shot of being anything more than a diversionary \u201cget my head back together\u201d rebound novel. I certainly didn\u2019t imagine it had any chance of sweeping me up off my feet and carrying me way into its narrative. \u2026but it did. The story made me love it despite myself. PLOT SUMMARY:Set in England at the outbreak of WWII, young David loves books and stories. We meet David as he is watches his mother slowly die from illness. When she finally succumbs to death, David is devastated (I told you book this wasn\u2019t a bright box of sunshine). Eventually, David\u2019s dad gets remarried to a woman named Rose and the three of them move to Rose\u2019s country home where David\u2019s half brother, Georgie, is soon born. David is given the room of Rose\u2019s uncle, Jonathan Tulvey, who shared David\u2019s love of books and stories. Jonathan vanished as a young boy and has never been seen since. The books in Jonathan\u2019s room are old and full of ancient stories and many contain odd notes written by Jonathan. While Rose is nice and tries to form a bond with David, he finds himself increasingly angry at her and his new half-brother. He spends more and more time among the old books which begin to whisper to him and David starts to witness strange occurrences, including the appearance of a \u201ccrooked man\u201d watching him. Eventually David finds himself in another world where dark, grim versions of classic fairy tale characters exist but are nothing like the way they are normally portrayed. The depictions of these characters are outstanding and it often takes a while to identify who they are because they are so stripped of the normal fluffy accoutrements. While, most of the tone is serious and even bleak, there are some great moments of comedy. For example, in one of my favorite scenes, David encounters the Seven Dwarfs who turn out to be communist revolutionaries and political activists straight out of Monty Python\u2019s Holy Grail:\nTheir relationship with Snow White is anything but pleasant. However, it is very, very funny. David soon discovers that he must make it to the King of this new world who might have the power to send him back home. However, David\u2019s journey is dark and perilous and he is constantly hunted by the \u201ccrooked man\u201d who has his own need of David. THOUGHTS:The beginning of the story takes its time to develop, but this leisurely pace didn\u2019t bother because Connolly does an amazing job with it. He keeps us engaged as he introduces us to the characters and slowly allows the fantasy elements to creep and and crawl and bleed into the narrative. This makes the transition from our world into the fantasy world feel authentic and seamless. In addition, the early events of the story turn out to be critical to the central plot and final resolution of the story and so form important threads in the overall tapestry. As alluded to above, I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel given how emotionally spent I was after reading The Child Thief. It's a credit to how marvelous a job Connolly did with this work that he was able to hold me enthralled to the narrative throughout. The characters are well drawn, with details and shadings to their personalities that make them come alive. I bonded with David very early on making the dangers that he faced all the more gripping. Finally, the plot itself was compelling and page-turningly addictive and Connolly\u2019s prose and descriptive talents were both excellent. Overall, a sensational book that over came great odds to pleasantly surprise me. If you get the chance to pick this book up...take it. 4.5 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}, {"userName": "Helen \u03a1\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af \u0395\u03c9\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2   Vernus Portitor Arcanus

Fugues are usually precipitated by a stressful episode.in world war 2-era england, young David loses his mother after a lingering illness and begins to experience strange dissociative episodes, often involving the sounds of books whispering to him and usually ending with him falling into unconsciousness. soon enough, his father finds a new wife named Rose - a nurse at his mother's hospice - and David finds himself with a stepmother and an infant half-brother. David is deeply unhappy with this development. after the new family moves out of london to Rose's country home in order to escape german bombers, David realizes a shadowy, crooked figure has sinister designs on him and his brother. one night, after a particularly bad argument with his folks, David hears his mother's voice calling him. following that voice, he crawls into a hole within a sunken garden - just as a german bomber also falls from the sky and crashes into that garden. he emerges into a sinister fantasyland. his quest: Find and Rescue His Mother. his nemesis: The Crooked Man.John Connolly is best known as a respected writer of an excellent detective series. his strengths have been widely reported: gorgeously dark and lush descriptive skills, a sensitive portrayal of private eye Charlie Parker - an unusually tormented protagonist (tragic even for a genre noted for its sad, sad heroes), and a unsettling ability to mix the prosaic with the supernatural to startling effect. in this book, Connolly takes each of those gifts and streamlines them in a way that is appropriate for the reader of young adult or even children's literature - although this novel is very clearly an Adult Fairy Tale. the result is pleasingly distinctive. there are many scenes that are striking in their psychosocial nuance, their foreboding atmosphere, their ability to evoke that wonderfully shivery feeling of fearful anticipation. my favorite passage happens early on: David's daunting entry into the strange fantasy world... an eerie vignette that is a model of careful, suspenseful writing, featuring unearthly quiet, child-like flowers, a a taciturn Woodsman, the smoking remains of the german bomber, bleeding trees, a house in the woods with a Giger-like exterior, and a gathering of evil wolfish beings.Dionysian imitatio, a literary method of imitation conceived as the practice of emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.Book of Lost Things is a book of mythopoeic templates - revisited, revised, regurgitated, remixed, and reimagined. we have an entire company of Big Bad Wolves, reconfigured as ambitious wolf-men, born of a grotesquely slutty Little Red Hood and sprung from the nightmares of a juvenile king... a perhaps not-so-Wicked Stepmother... a malevolent and terrifying Sleeping Beauty... Childe Roland, transformed as a brave gay soldier in search of his long-lost lover... trolls and harpies and a savage, hungry Beast... a young girl's spirit in a glass jar... and our villain, a gleeful child-thief, a striker of dark bargains, a Rumpelstiltskin, an old old devil: The Crooked Man.the use of revisionism is, sadly, not always successful. a comic interlude with the socialist Seven Dwarves and an obese, monstrous Snow White is depressingly unfunny and a little desperate (at least to this reader). and a long part near the end, depicting various torture chambers and examples of The Crooked Man's terrible villainy seems to be merely an excuse for Connolly to indulge himself with a gloatingly vicious array of sadistic tableau. both sequences were eye-rolling and sigh-inducing.but those are aberrations; despite them, Connolly more than succeeds in creating delightful and intriguing reinterprations of figures from fairy and folk tale. even better, David's character is a slow-burning but dynamic one, changing in bits and starts from boy to man with each new encounter. he is a realistically flawed protagonist as well as a brave and endearing little hero.Memento mori, a Latin phrase translated as \"Remember your mortality\", \"Remember you must die\" or \"Remember you will die\"... it names a genre of artistic work which varies widely, but which all share the same purpose: to remind people of their own mortality.the novel's extended endings were a brilliant surprise. to avoid spoilers, i'll just say that i was entirely taken aback by the meaning of The Book of Lost Things itself. and - even more memorably, more intensely - the closing pages' no-nonsense illustration of the potential and/or inherent tragedy of human life in general... and the idea of that tragedy - no matter how intimate - somehow not really being that tragic at all - just simply a part of the greater cycle of life, death, and rebirth. i hate to end a review with a tv show reference... but if you have ever seen the last 10 minutes or so of Six Feet Under's final episode - a wondrously sad, wistful, yet somehow uplifting experience - you will know exactly what i mean. the ending of this rather fantastic book is equally moving."}, {"userName": "Mith", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3620424-mith", "userReview": "[, extremely downtrodden (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Robotkarateman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/979246-robotkarateman", "userReview": "NOTICE (Please read this first): I'm happy to discuss my opinion of this book with you if you had a different take, but if your intent is merely to attack my opinion, I'm not interested. Since I posted this way back in 2008, a (very) small minority of this book's fans have taken my review personally and have written some very long, very insulting responses telling me why I'm wrong. So please allow me to clarify something - This is my opinion of the book. It will undoubtedly differ from yours because we are not the same person. You are welcome to refute me by giving the book a much higher rating and more glowing review ... on your own account. You are also welcome to tell me you disagree below, but if you can't do it in a less-than-essay-long format, I will delete your comment. If you need to get nasty and personal with your remarks, I'll probably be reporting and blocking you as well.  Connolly's \"Book of Lost Things\" came highly recommended as a modern take on the fantasy genre. What I found instead was a completely unlikeable main character, an array of interchangeable father figures, and a disappointing rehash of the usual fairy tale parodies. \"Lost Things\" centers on David, a boy whose mother dies and whose father remarries and has a second child, leaving David to bicker bitterly with his new stepmother while trying to avoid anxiety attacks that leave him blacked out and feverish. And that groundwork occurs in one of the most poorly paced info-dumps I've had the misfortune to read. The first chapter focuses on David and his mother, leading you to believe this will be the crux of the story - but alas, she dies. The second chapter focuses on the father's remarriage and David's anxiety attacks leading the reader to believe, perhaps, this is the focus of the story - it is not. The third and fourth chapters center on David's mostly absent father whose work is \"top secret\" and David's fights with his step-mother and we, the audience, raise our index fingers and say, \"Ah-ha! Top secret Dad! Conflict with the new parental figure! This, surely, is the story!\" But, alas, those are red-herrings as well. In fact, after the sixth chapter, neither of those characters appears again until the (two chapters long!) epilogue. The real story ends up being David's abduction into the land of fairy tales by the Crooked Man, a Rumpelstiltskin who makes vicious bargains with emotional children to feed his magical slave house. David starts off his true adventure by following the voice of his dead mother - but don't assume that the story somehow involves David's mother's spirit wandering painfully in the fantasy realm awaiting rescue, this too, in Connolly fashion, is completely irrelevant to the story. Instead, David wanders the fantasy realm accompanied by a series of nearly identical substitute fathers who end up betraying David's trust in one way or another - by being gay in one case (Roland), by being fallible in another (the generic Woodsman). In the end, David finds another potential father figure in Jonathon, and quickly realizes that not only is Jonathon a liar and a murderer, but also that he, David, no longer needs a father figure because he's now become a man of his own right. He then stares down Jonathon, the Crooked Man, and the vicious wolf monsters, who until that point only appeared in the story when Connolly felt the need to remind us that David was in danger because wolf monsters were chasing him; they never catch up to him except at the end and, as I said, David simply stares them down and wins by virtue of his newfound manhood.In all, \"Lost Things\" is a plodding, thinly veiled paean to a baby-boomer-era view of \"manhood\" as stoic resolution and resistance to all hurts, including mental and emotional. Perhaps this story plays better, and I don't wish to be insulting, with a female audience, one that's never had to grapple with questions of \"manliness\" or had to decide on an appropriate level of attachment to an older male. As for me, I was insulted that David begins the story emotionally wounded by what he views as a betrayal by his father and, instead of finding closure, he learns to just get over it and \"be a man\" about it. But a bigger insult, in my eyes, was the closing of the book - Connolly is so in love with his work that he follows up the main story with almost 150 pages of notes and commentary on his story: everything from the origins of the fairy tales he parodies to his woeful recollections of scenes that were cut from the final draft (murder your darlings, Connolly!). It's as jarring as it would be had Stephen King ended Christine with detailed descriptions of a Plymouth Belvedere and ten pages of him crying about the Arnie/Christine tailpipe sex scene that his editors excised from the final publication. This was my first experience with Connolly, and as it's his most highly recommended book, I'll probably pass on his work in the future."}, {"userName": "Carol.

Some would say that it\u2019s a story of losing one\u2019s innocence, but are we ever really innocent? Through time we have come to develop feelings of grief, rage, hatred, and jealousy. These are some of the things that eat the pure off of us. At some point, we have all become the things we feared the most. We have turned into our very own monsters, destroying the good that is ahead of us. This is the story of how David overcame his monsters.As a young boy, David lost his mother, and his only means of coping up with his grief was reading, an interest he got from her. The books started whispering to him and only he could hear them. Months after his beloved mother\u2019s death, his father remarried. Rose, his father\u2019s new love got pregnant with Georgie, David\u2019s new half-brother. As a part of starting a new life with his step-mother and half-brother, David and his father moved out of their London home and into Rose\u2019s which was located out of the city. There, in the old house, he was given a room that was used to be of a boy named Jonathan Tulvey. It was filled with old books that David tried to read for himself although some he could not understand thoroughly.In his dreams and around the house, David began seeing a figure of a man with distinct, odd features. Drawing closer and closer to him, waiting in the shadows, was the Crooked Man.I borrowed a copy of this from my cousin and it had been sitting on my shelf for months. At first, I was not too thrilled to start reading it due to the synopsis at the back of the book. It was not very attractive to me. I decided to read it just so I could return it to her sooner. I was so wrong to judge this book by the few words written on its back cover. I was not expecting it to fascinate me, to touch my heart, and to show me what it means to live and to be alive, but it did. It was an extraordinary experience that was beyond my anticipation for it. The synopsis didn\u2019t do it justice. It was a dark, strange, tragic, and bloody adventure that every child in us would fear, but the adult in us would come to understand the truth beneath its surface. In it are very familiar tales that were distorted to suit the book\u2019s eeriness, constructing a twisted realm parallel to David\u2019s reality.David was a child at the beginning of the story, and you could really visualize how his character developed. He became more mature as he learned to decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. In time, he also became more selfless, learning that love could cause a terrible ache, and living, sometimes, could hurt. His journey in the world beyond the sunken garden emblematized a lot of things that he was battling in his heart. They were struggles he had to face to help him cope with the pain of losing his mother and adjust to his new life.The world that the author wrote into being was quite disturbing. It was stripped off of peace, innocence, and hope. In every corner of it lurked danger that a child like David, realistically, might not be able to endure. I don\u2019t even think adults could come out alive of the situations David found himself in. There were beasts, creatures that could kill or mangle you. There was also a bit of sexual content implied in it that I was not expecting. It was not graphic, but it would be perturbing if a very young child would mistaken this as a children\u2019s book and read it. He could either be very curious to try those things out or be afraid of them.A hundred pages on the origin stories and source materials were included in the latter part of the book, explaining further how each distorted tale woven into The Book of Lost Things represented something significant in David\u2019s life. It gave me a clearer insight of what David was going through, reminding me more that, somehow, I have been there too. It was quite amusing to reread those fairytales and to read some of them for the first time. They felt familiar but at the same time strange because after all these years of not reading them and then revisiting them now, it seemed to me that they were telling a different story that exhibited deeper reason than how I perceived them when I was just a child. There were also explanations on how each of the characters represented an archetype or a persona that contributed greatly not only to the development of this story, but also to those that inspired it.This is a really cleverly-written adventure and I highly recommend it. I hope you guys would give it a try. Surely, I will be reading more books written by this author in the future."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "4 stars to John Connolly's The Book of Lost Things. I added this to my \"To Read\" list sometime in 2015 as it reminded me a little bit of the \"Once Upon a Time\" TV series which I love. And it didn't disappoint!\nStory\nA young adult novel focusing on a young boy's quest to fit in his earthly world and survive in his fantasy world in 1940's England. Young David (around 10) has suffered a lot as a boy. His mother dies early, his father remarries quickly. He is shy and doesn't venture much out of his room. When he's forced to accept his new stepmother and then his young half-brother, David mysteriously disappears into his books through a realm in secret sunken garden where he's immediately thrown into fairy tale land. He must find a way out but quickly learns the fairy tales all have a dark side in this universe, and he's not the first to be transported to the new world from his old world. He's faced with the be-all, end-all question of selfish vs. selfless behavior. What will he choose and what are the impacts?\nStrengths\n1. John Connolly has a vivid imagination with brilliant characters and creates a fun re-appropriation of beloved fairy tales.2. You see a lot of yourself in David and know what he's doing wrong all the time -- makes you realize the commonality among all of us.\nWeaknesses\n1. Not enough of the fairy tales are included to truly feel like you've shown us the full picture of this world. We need more!2. I don't know enough about David's family and real world experiences to understand how/why he was chosen to enter the new world - so I'm a bit doubtful of the premise and how children are chosen by the Crooked Man.\nFinal Thoughts\nIt's still a great read. I think it's appropriate for pre-teens across the curriculum. It will speak volumes to different types of kids -- those who love to read, those who have problems at home, those who just love fantasy, those who like history... need to compare novels like this to others in its genre to provoke true literary analytics, e.g. this vs. \"Harry Potter,\" this vs. \"Life as We Knew It\" and this vs. \"Chronicles of Narnia.\" I think it's a great \"survival of the fittest\" read to help young adults learn how to mature.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

I love getting back to it every once in a while and reread few passages, i feel it pulling me back in, tempting me to dive in its beautiful world of adventures once again. so finally i decided to post my thoughts about it.One thing you should know about me, is that I LOVE fairy-tales, especially the ones that contain a dark twist. and oh my .. this book gave me everything.World Building :The world that the author created was absolutely mesmerizing, the world building was impeccable and so well thought of, the writing style is easy to get lost into, I actually felt like i was there, you could feel the magic around you, the air of that forest, and the howling of the wolves, it was detailed enough that you can see the place clearly but not too much that it became boring. ( using too much details can ruin the book for me )This is not a young adult book like I expected. it was very dark, and some parts are just so twisted but very well written. the pacing of the story was also good, it took me a few pages to get into it, especially at first, but once i did, it was impossible not to continue and not want more, so i would say that this is definitely a page turner. The characters  : I loved all the characters in this book, they seemed so real. and i absolutely ADORED David, all his flaws made him more relatable and more human, in this story I believe we follow him in a journey of finding himself rather than finding his mother . The crooked man  what a clever idea ! i guess this story is about him in a way, he is the weaver of the events and the world of the story, he's the mastermind . I didn't have any problem or inconvenience regarding this book, everything is so well done and brilliant, which made the experience of reading this book so vivid. i also enjoyed the dark fairy-tales included in this book, it's something different, in a good way of course.The ending of this book tore me to pieces, it's the most perfectly written ending that i have ever encountered in a book. i cried so much. it is the kind of book that stays in your head even after you finish it.I would recommend it to everyone, because i feel like it's something that must be read at least once in our lives.John  , THANK you for this masterpiece, i can't imagine not reading this book as it's such a big part of my life"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah", "userReview": "I am as surprised as anyone about my rating - I genuinely thought I would adore this book. So much in fact that I kept putting off reading it to ensure I'd get the most of it. On the surface, this book is perfect for me as it combines many of my favourite things: fairy tales, hidden worlds, adult books with children as the lenses through which to see these hidden worlds, re-tellings, a sibling relationship that feels real, imaginative world building and and and.Don't get me wrong, this book was perfectly alright; it is very readable and well-plotted. The characters and their relationships make sense, the world created is interesting, and the fairy tales are well integrated. I am still dissappointed because it could have been SO much better. We follow David who is mourning his mother and feels betrayed that his father has found a new wife and had a child with her. He starts having seizures and seeing and hearing strange things until he finds himself in a new world - a world so very strange but still familiar, one where he has to fear for his life and will have to be braver than he has ever been.See, that sounds just like my type of book. Maybe my expecation just were too high and I was hoping for it to be more like \"Pan's Labyrinth\" - one of my all-time favourite movies. I thought the atmosphere could have been developed better to more work with the world detailed. I found the language to be too simplistic or not simplistic enough, I am not sure - if you are going to use different fairy tales to weave your tapestry your language needs to mirror those very closely or not at all. I reckon I caught most allusions to different fairy tales - I did grow up reading fairy tales, again and again and again - and this might actually have been one of my problems.

I loved this! First off, let me tell you that this is not something for the faint of heart. Some passages were definitely scary or just plain twisted and gross (think bad witch cutting off children's heads and putting them on animals to then hunt them..). I want to get that out of the way because the word fairytale can be misleading. Those elements in the story were used sparingly though and never took over the story to the point were it turned into the horror genre. David, the main character, is a young boy who has just lost his mother. That event triggered something in him and he experiences seizures and is suddenly able to hear his books whisper and talk. The angrier he gets at his father for starting to live and marry again the more he experiences the real world and the world of stories blurring... until he becomes a part of one. He completely disappears into a world next to our own and has to find his way back. Of course, evil powers are trying to prevent him from doing so. It's a fairytale itself after all. The overall atmosphere is dark and scary. I was not expecting it to be for an older audience, but that is how it read for me. Looking at the cover I was expecting it to almost lean towards the middle grade genre. The twisted and scary parts of the story are not something I would recommend to someone of that age though. There are plenty of well-known fairytales mentioned that make it fun for someone who has been exposed to them over the years, but they have been turned into their nightmare version. The little red riding hood, for example, lays with a wolf she had followed through the woods and through their encounter an evil wold-human hybrid comes into existence. On the other hand, the chapter about Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs is plain hilarious. She is an arrogant, awful and high maintenance young woman and the dwarfs feel so oppressed that they have turned into communists. You have to read in order to really appreciate this crazy storyline hahaI enjoyed a lot and highly recommend this to people who are in for a dark, twisted, and edgy version of a fairytale retelling."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20625013-liz", "userReview": "I loved this story. Fantastical adventures, battles, castles, monsters, magicians, heroes, and foes. There was so much more than I expected in this book -- which is billed as YA, yet of which I remain unconvinced -- but none of those things are even the best part. What moved me the most was the story of David himself, and the evolution of his character. David is a twelve year old boy who is grieving the loss of his mother and struggling to accept the upheaval of his life. And he\u2019s angry\u2026 who wouldn\u2019t be? His love of books, instilled in him early on by his mother, leads him to an adventure both wondrous and terrifying, during which he will learn to face his fears, find his strength, and finally come to terms with how he really feels. I was initially reminded of another beautiful book, A Monster Calls, which also reflects on how we as humans, whether child or adult, often simply don\u2019t know what to do with such intense feelings of grief and anger, feelings that can manifest themselves in ways we don\u2019t expect. There are some super creepy, skeevy, scary moments here that make me wonder how a twelve year old would feel reading it, but perhaps I am underestimating today\u2019s young readers. After all, I was reading Stephen King when I was still in grade school! I have not been through what David has been through, nor seen what he\u2019s seen, but I connected with him and I cared about him. To me, that is the single most important thing that an author can accomplish. Thank you Mr. Connolly.

Everyone had teeth and claws.This one got fangs. And razor-sharp claws.It will lure you in with promises of magical books and mysterious flowers. Then, when it has you firmly in it's grasp, it will suck you in deeper into the dark. And won't let you go until it has its way with you.In Book of Lost Things, John Conolly collected fragments of my beloved bed time stories,twisted them so crookedly,and made them ornaments to a dark,beautiful world of his own. A world of betrayal and charming witches. Of wars and different forms of love. Of friendship and sacrifices. Of death. Of second chances. Of trees that bleed and lost children never found again. Of stories that end in death. Of our worst nightmares given life. And of the crooked man that haunts the shadowy parts of our imagination, the one we know but not really. What's his name again? Rumple-Right. Don't say it now. You know he doesn't like it when you do.In a prose that is both rich and cunning, Conolly indulgently and unhurriedly tells the story of young, grudge-holding, selfish,and book-obsessed David who entered a crack in the wall of a sunken garden in hopes of gaining back everything that he's lost. He took his time, making sure to catch his readers unaware time and time again by dropping these little bombs one by one.Some stories do not get happy endings.Princes and Princesses aren't perfect.There's but a very thin line separating bravery from foolishness.Even kings don't know everything.Sometimes you could rely on others for help. But mostly there's only really you.The smallest of hearts could be incubating the greatest of evil.The smallest of hearts have endless,cavernous rooms.Most of these most of us already know of course. But still we are a bit startled to encounter them here,in The Book of Lost Things and the little fairy stories in it. Because what are these facts doing here? In fantasy? Among tales that are supposed to tell us white knights shall be riding to our rescue, convince us little girls outwit big,hungry bears, and reassure us that all will come to a happy end. But just like the stories that I love best,this one gives you choices.A. David,a disturbed boy who got worse after his mother's death was lodged into a crack in the wall of a sunken garden after an explosion and had a really vivid,long dream- a dream that he returned to moments before his death.B. David entered the crack in the wall into Elsewhere,a world very different from ours but just as real.Or C. Elsewhere exists only in our imaginations but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not real.There.

finishing this novel, my first read from John Connolly:It was so gut-wrenchingly emotional. Every bit of it. From the harrowing beginning, to the Labyrinth-on-acid fantasy world in which the main character soon finds himself. There's so much going on in this novel. It seems like a children's fairy tale, but if I had read this as a young'un, I would probably be in an insane asylum to this day. I know Connolly typically writes crime fiction and this being my first, I'm unable to compare it to his other work. But from this reading, I know that Connolly is a man of deep thoughtfulness and emotion, and one who can perfectly transfer that emotion and philosophy to the written page. The way the beginning is written, in which the main character, David, is dealing with his mother's slow death, I have no doubt that Connolly is writing from his own experiences. The minute details he chooses to include are just spot on. One thing to know before going in, this book will twist your head in knots. I've read a lot of horror fiction through the years, but many scenes in this book, partly because of their juxtaposition of childlike fairy tales and real-world, grown-up horrors, make this, on the whole, easily the most horrific collection of scenes I've read in my life. And I see no other novel containing scenes that come close to their power. For that reason, it did take me a little longer to get through this novel. I would read a few chapters and become so overwhelmed by what was going on, I needed a break: sometimes hours, sometimes a day. There is a LOT of weight to this book, even with its deceptively simple prose and presentation. I can easily say this is a book I will never forget. It will haunt me. And I think David Bowie would approve:"}, {"userName": "\u0388\u03bb\u03c3\u03b1", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63862566", "userReview": "\u03a5\u03a0\u0395\u03a1\u039f\u03a7\u039f, \u039a\u0391\u03a4\u0391\u03a0\u039b\u0397\u039a\u03a4\u0399\u039a\u039f, \u03a3\u03a5\u0393\u039a\u039b\u039f\u039d\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u0399\u039a\u039f!!!"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/520753-kim", "userReview": "This is why I don't read the front jacket of books.

Snow White as a hefty, insult laden uber wench? yeah. whatever.The story outside of these sidebars is actually quite interesting, a boy's journey in a strange land, grieving over his dead mom, etc... but I still found myself wondering what those dudes that did the Narnia films could make out of it.

I wish I'd liked it more; rather, I wish it'd been better-executed. My main trouble was with the telling-not-showing style of writing. In the words of Twain, \"Don\u2019t say 'the old lady screamed.' Bring her on and let her scream.\" The turbulence of David's inner life ends up muffled by the flat and dispassionate narrative (\"He experienced a wave of pity for the dead man...\", \"He was still angry at God for what had happened to his mother, and for bringing Rose and Georgie into his life\"). Connolly may have been trying for \"once-upon-a-time\" fairy-tale remove, but only undercuts what could've been a really heartbreaking and harrowing journey.The twisted fairy tale elements of the book are indeed pretty clever -- the seven dwarfs as Marxist proletarians, hee -- but did we need the massive and pretentious index at the end? Sure, I was interested to (re-)read the source material, but the prefatory paragraphs, overexplaining how the material is incorporated into the narrative, are insufferable -- worse than those headsets you can clap on at art museums. Again, don't tell me how adept you are. Show me. And shut up."}, {"userName": "Crystal Craig", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729956-crystal-craig", "userReview": "I've owned a paper copy of The Book of Lost Things for a very long time. I obtained a copy - probably at a yard sale or some used bookstore - long before I first joined Goodreads back in 2008. I don't understand why I never got to reading this book; I'm punching myself in the face because I waited so long to discover such a fantastic book. The writer, John Connolly quickly pulls the reader into the make believe place he created. I felt an immediate connection to the main character, 12-year-old, David. This book is pure fantasy and reads like a fairy tale, so if you don't enjoy fantasy, it's probably not the novel for you. The writing is well done, and, therefore, one of many reasons I recommend it."}], "description": "High in his attic bedroom, twelve-year-old David mourns the death of his mother, with only the books on his shelf for company. But those books have begun to whisper to him in the darkness. Angry and alone, he takes refuge in his imagination and soon finds that reality and fantasy have begun to meld. While his family falls apart around him, David is violently propelled into a world that is a strange reflection of his own -- populated by heroes and monsters and ruled by a faded king who keeps his secrets in a mysterious book, The Book of Lost Things.Taking readers on a vivid journey through the loss of innocence into adulthood and beyond, New York Times bestselling author John Connolly tells a dark and compelling tale that reminds us of the enduring power of stories in our lives.", "title": "The Book of Lost Things", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69136.The_Book_of_Lost_Things", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388253367l/69136.jpg", "reviews": 6918, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38951.John_Connolly", "name": "John Connolly"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Young Adult", "Horror", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69136.The_Book_of_Lost_Things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16114143", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/494610.The_Book_of_Lost_Things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10291890-the-book-of-lost-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/905559.The_Book_of_Lost_Things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175242.Every_Dead_Thing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175246.The_Killing_Kind", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6411440-the-gates", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175243.Dark_Hollow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175247.The_Unquiet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
