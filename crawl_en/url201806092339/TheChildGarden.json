I loved her writing style in this standalone and loved it in this novel as well. She manages to combine an eeriness, some follklore and superstitions with some amazing characters and many elements of the traditional mystery. This outing features a woman who becomes embroiled in a mystery, who done it when a friend from her earlier school days lands on her doorstep. So she investigates suspect by suspect, with some pretty coincidental discoveries. She is also the divorced mother of a seriously handicapped young man who is her top priority. Loved the trail she sets off on and also liked that though there are many people involved she takes them one by one. A good solid mystery and I certainly hope McPherson keeps writing her stand-alones.

It alludes to the poems of Robert Louis Stevenson in \u201cThe Child\u2019s Garden of Verses\u201d and also to the garden of Eden Boarding School, near Galloway, Scotland.The protagonist of \u201cThe child garden\u201d is Gloria Harkness. Though only forty years of age, she has led a tragic life. She wouldn\u2019t agree. Divorced and the mother of a severely disabled fifteen year old boy, Gloria nevertheless feels lucky to have him in her life. Her son Nicky suffers from a neuro-degenerative disease called PKAN. He lives in a long-term facility. In order to afford the fees associated with his care, Gloria has moved into the house next door to the home. She lives there rent free in exchange for taking care of the house and pets, and daily visiting the owner, Miss Drumm, who also resides in the care home in an adjoining room to Nicky. Oh\u2026 and another duty she is to carry out\u2026. rocking the ancient stone in the garden which folklore and Miss Drumm declares is said to house the Devil himself. Gloria, being the sensible sort, doesn\u2019t believe in the legends, but she obligingly rocks the stone twice a day to humour the old lady.Her lonely routine seldom varies. By day she works as a registrar in the nearby town of Dalry. Her evenings are spent in the care home chatting with Miss Drumm and reading to her son. This is her only social life \u2013 except that which she finds between the pages of books.Her unvaried routine is shattered when Stephen \u201cStig\u201d Tarrant, a school friend, turns up on her doorstep saying he\u2019s being stalked. He has arranged to have a meeting with his stalker, April Cowan, on the grounds of the former school \u2013 now nursing home. He seems apprehensive, so Gloria suggests that she accompany him. This simple act will forever change both their lives and will eventually shed light on a twenty year old mystery.On May Day, twenty years ago the students of Eden School spent the night out of doors. In the morning one of them was dead. The resulting scandal caused the headmaster to be fired and the school closed down. The secrecy and lies surrounding this event has shadowed the lives of all those who were there. Stig and April were two of those children. Gloria, who has access to records at her work \u2013 delves into the other students who were there that fateful night. To her horror, she discovers that many of the students have committed suicide, and even more close to home\u2026 her ex-husband was one of those children as well!The novel which expounds on the ancient superstitions and folklore of Scotland, portrays how evil blamed on otherworldly causes has, more often than not, a very human source.An atmospheric thriller, with well-rounded characters and a compelling mystery ensured that this novel kept my attention throughout. I very much enjoyed the references to folklore, with references to Devil\u2019s bridges and Devil\u2019s stones. My only complaint is that at certain places in the plot I felt that Gloria leaps to conclusions rather too quickly.Last year I read and reviewed \u201cThe day she died\u201d by Catriona McPherson.

Knowing Catriona McPherson was a Sisters in Crime President, and of her series entries- still, this one was a surprise. It's almost a 5 star. The only thing that kept me giving it that 5th star was that the beginning was awkward. Not knowing any minutia or detail of this, not even that it WAS a mystery, I was not engaged in the first 4 or 5 pages at all and nearly did not continue. And once surrounded by the countryside and town around the old school that was once called \"Eden\" the story quickly, quickly became enthralling. This is not an action piece, although there is movement of the principle character, Gloria, to interview within surrounding areas. But the Scottish natural elements are clearly felt throughout. This is not a city book. Nor is it gruesome or chewy. The crimes are subversive and manipulative, not slasher. Excellent personality investigations of at least 7 or 8 characters. And McPherson is an absolute genius in descriptive human persona, IMHO. She nails the core with curt words from evasive eyes to the outward appearance. Excellent and highly recommend this book. One of the characters is a 15 year old who has not moved, been conscious for some years and his care deeply concerns our protagonist. It's her son. But it is NOT sad, in the way his Mother celebrates him.Wonderful and entertaining read. And the Garden of Verses by Robert Louis Stevenson- quotes and poems- that was appreciated, as well.13 children and an occurrence of 28 years ago cores. But this is slow, slow burn and scalding at the end. Much more about change to soul and psyche, beyond the physical inevitability.

Plot/Story:The Child Garden has an amazing plot story full of well-timed twists and turns. I enjoyed reading it t and tremendously and felt compelled to read it in one go. I was sucked right into the book from starting to end. The main suspense of the book is also mindblowing and there is no way in hell one could have guessed that the things will turn out the way they did. The pace of the story is great and the writing proceed smoothly without interfering the flow of the story. I really liked the deliberate slow progress of the investigation as it kept me intrigued throughout the book. One more thing that I'd like to add is that the small part of the book where the author used a little demon reference was the stroke of a genius. Why? Because it really made me put down the book at the night. it was a really small part (maybe a few pages,) but it really gave me a good scare.Characters:In spite of liking the story, I wasn't able to feel entirely connected to the main character, Gloria. The story is written in first-person but still I felt a little detached from her. In fact, at one point I felt that she herself was the murderer. I'm not sure what went wrong, but it just felt that the narration was responsible for the detachment I felt.The other main character is that of Stig and I really liked him, though I felt a little irritated at times to find out that in spite of whatever Gloria did for him, he continuously held back the truth from her. Still, I liked him a lot and enjoyed the amazing foods he dished out.Romance/Killings:There was no romance, but there were a number of killings. Though at times the murders were a little confusing (maybe because of Scottish names and surnames or the fact that a few names were similar,) I still enjoyed the book thoroughly. All the killings really intensified the pace of the story and left me wanting for more.Writing:As I mentioned earlier, the writing is good and flowed beautifully without interfering the reader's imagination. Though I felt the characterization was a little (just teeny-weeny) weak. I would have enjoyed more if the MC would have been a tad more relatable but nonetheless I still enjoyed the story. The attention to detail is remarkable!Beginning:This book hooked me right from the beginning. It started with a beautiful prologue and carried on with the same effect. Ending:The ending is mind blowing and I was completely spell-bound by suspense that was revealed at the end. Though I felt that the story was a little rushed right before the suspense was revealed.Book Cover:I love this book cover because it really gives me the willies! I picked up this book because of the cover and the blurb.Blurb:Okay now, this is where it gets a little ugly. The blurb is quite misleading. I thought that the book is a supernatural one (as the blurb says) but it is NOT. It's a suspense-thriller book.You can also read this review at The Reading Bud."}, {"userName": "Maxine (Booklover Catlady)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22943325-maxine-booklover-catlady", "userReview": "A very different book.

Her fourth standalone, The Child Garden, is just out and already receiving high praise, and I expect it to garner award attention, too. Nobody sets up a an atmospheric thriller better than Catriona, and she then weaves into this perfect setting a story with chilling twists and turns, populated with characters who may or may not be trustworthy. As a reader, you want to know the answers as much as the main character who is desperately trying to gain these answers before more death or bloodshed. I always seem to become completely ensconced in that character in Catriona's novels who is unraveling the lies and deceits to get to the person who perpetuates evil and murder. In The Child Garden, Gloria Harkness is a single,divorced mother living in an isolated area of Scottish countryside, inhabiting a house aptly named Rough House on a neglected estate, where a care home also is located. The care home is a residence for Gloria's son afflicted with PKAN and the elderly woman, Mrs. Drume, who owns the estate, including Rough House. Gloria's life is uneventful with a routine of going to work as a registrar, registering births, weddings, and deaths; visiting her son and Mrs. Drume in the care home; and reading books. In exchange for paying no rent, Gloria has agreed to take care of Mrs. Drume's senior dog and to rock the \"rocking stone\" in the backyard of Rough House twelve times a day to keep what her elderly landlady says is the devil imprisoned within. Thus has life continued for Gloria Harkness over the past ten years.On the perfect dark and stormy night, Gloria's life is turned upside down. A chance recognition by a grade school friend results in that friend knocking on her door that moonless evening, and as she opens the door to Stephen \"Stig\" Tarrant, she is letting in danger and evil. Her life and the lives of those she knows will never be the same. Stig Tarrant is being chased by a past from 28 years ago when he was one of twelve students at a private school named Eden. Eden occupied the large estate house where the care home now operates. In the one and only year the school existed, a young boy lost his life there, and the children who attended school at Eden, including Stig, have had unkind fates ever since. Now, someone has set up Stig to look like the murderer of one of his old classmates, or that's what Gloria has chosen to believe when she agrees to help Stig. As Gloria investigates the lives of the other students and tries to piece together just what happened that tragic night that one student died on the grounds of the school, she uncovers far too many coincidences and encounters lie after lie, some from Stig himself. There are plenty of suspects as to who's behind the nefarious doings of past and present. Even the Devil is high on the list.Catriona McPherson has once again given readers an on-the-edge-of-your-seat mystery thriller to fray the nerves and tax the brain. It is unpredictable, but never unfairly so. Readers will enjoy every creepy moment and probably won't mind that it haunts them afterward."}, {"userName": "Space Out With Sci Fi in June The Haunted Reading Room", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7302570-space-out-with-sci-fi-in-june-the-haunted-reading-room", "userReview": "REVIEW: THE CHILD GARDEN by Catriona McPhersonTHE CHILD GARDEN is a scrumptious Scottish noir delight, jam packed with isolation, scenery, old secrets full of lust and greed, jealousy, bullying, and cruelty.

Left it a month, restarted at the beginning, read 40 pages, put it aside then picked it back up at the end of January. All of which might lead you to believe I didn\u2019t really enjoy it. Quash that notion, as once I got into it properly, I enjoyed the story and mystery, more so than the characters. Events of the past - a child\u2019s death at a hippy-style, knit your own yoghurt while hugging a tree school \u2013 resurface in the present day. One of the children involved twenty-eight years ago, Stephen turns up at the remote dwelling of Gloria on a dark, filthy night in rural Scotland.Gloria wasn\u2019t involved in the incident years ago, but in spite of a few issues of her own, she decides to help Stephen. Gloria\u2019s troubles revolve around her severely disabled son, Nicky. Nicky is housed up the road at a care home, the site of the former hippy school. Gloria is constantly fearful of his continued welfare particularly in the future, should Miss Drumm, another resident at the home and her benefactor of sorts pass on. She\u2019s on her own. Her former husband, Duggie had difficulty accepting Nicky\u2019s condition and the marriage didn\u2019t survive.Stephen has been in contact with another former pupil at the school, April Cowan and is due to meet up with her. With Gloria in tow they descend on the meeting place and discover April\u2019s corpse. Panicking they flee and don\u2019t inform the police. When Gloria returns later, the body has been moved and Stephen is soon named as the prime suspect in April\u2019s murder.Who is trying to set up Stephen and why? Gloria, while Stephen plays house, starts trying to track down the former pupils in an effort to understand what is going on.Amateur sleuthing, loneliness, issues of trust, concern for family, a bit of an adventure, secrets, more deaths (mainly historic) involving the former pupils of the school, and a solution.Our main character, Gloria was a surprise. Initially I had the impression she was timid and insular, but as the story progressed she became more confident and assertive, not above a bit of subterfuge and deception in an effort to get some answers, and a lot less of a shrinking violet than I expected.Enjoyable in the main, though I kind of found the whole raison d\u2019etre for events a tad of a stretch. The author did have me guessing as to the identity of our guilty party, I had two candidates penciled in along the way, but was hopelessly wrong-footed.4 from 5Scottish author, Catriona McPherson has written the Dandy Gilver series of historical mysteries, as well as about six standalone novels.

It was a great mystery and had a creepy setting, so if you love slightly creepy mysteries (it isn't quite \"cozy crime\", but it's close), then I think you might really enjoy this one. However, these are the things that knocked it down to merely a \"like\" for me:--I couldn't connect to the narrator at all. Not a lick! I think part of this has to do with the fact that I couldn't wrap my head around her hermitage, closing herself off just so she can live near her disabled son. It seemed kind of jarring that she would just suddenly leave that existence to go solve a crime. I also felt like she did some dumb things in the course of the book (like taking in a man suspected of murder!) and her reasoning wasn't always the soundest. --The supernatural/creepy overtones weren't strong enough. I wanted to dive more into the folklore behind the bridges, the stone, etc., but it felt like these little elements were merely glossed on for flavor, and not really part of the story.--The way everyone was referred to with a nickname got really confusing for me. Maybe I was just tired when I was reading, but I had trouble keeping track of who was who and where they were and what happened next...ugh. This gave me a bit of a headache.As I said, overall, this was a great mystery with a nice ending to it--I just had some bumps in the road while reading it.

When I got started it took me about 25-30% of the book to really get into the story, once I did though I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are many characters we are introduced to within this story and the author does a great job with the detailing of each. We meet a group of school kids from years ago and Gloria, her son Nicky and Miss Drumm. What took me awhile to grab onto in this story was that Gloria decided to hide a body and investigate the whole \"murder\" herself from snooping into the lives of each kid that went to Eden. It is a sort of cozy mystery.The story is a spooky tail of a cursed bridge, the devil inside a rock that needs to be rocked 13 times daily and people \"committing\" suicide from not being able to handle the past event. It has some creepy parts and folklore. I enjoyed the story once it picked up, Gloria's character did bug me and I think that is why it was harder for me to get into it at the beginning. We didn't know much about why she lived in a rickety old house alone with a dog and a couple cats in the middle of nowhere at the beginning. I give this book a 3 out of 5 stars.

She\u2019s not given to artifice and is very comfortable in her skin. She\u2019s the type of person one would want to know, and upon whose loyalty one could depend. At the same time, it is a pleasure to have a character so realistic; one who becomes exhausted, and overwhelmed to the point of tears. Her friend Stig is delightful. No big, brave man is he, unless it\u2019s in the kitchen. It\u2019s quite lovely to see a reversal of traditional roles. Yet one may also find oneself questioning and a bit suspicious of him. Miss Dunn, the owner of Rough House, Gloria\u2019s landlady, and now living in the neighboring room to Gloria\u2019s son, is a delightful character. She is also the link to the story\u2019s pagan mythology.The story\u2019s plot is extremely good.

It is also satisfyingly convincing as a Scottish novel, and having lived there previously, I found the way of life and the phrasing very familiar.The central character of Gloria is totally convincing as a woman, who through circumstances has fallen into a very restrictive and isolated lifestyle, and Stephen is similarly convincing as a seemingly nice and comforting reminder of the past, but who Gloria is not entirely sure she can trust.There is mystery, intrigue, unexplained deaths which mount up, superstition and hatred in what turns out to be a jolly good read.

This would be a good book for a lazy afternoon when you are looking for something to get lost in. Great descriptions and atmosphere.

I want atmosphere and lots of it. Yes, there's a prologue here which describes just what happened 30 years before (or maybe it doesn't...) but then when we quickly come back to the present day, McPherson skilfully establishes a great sense of place. That's what I look for - ever since reading Sherlock Holmes years ago, I want to be shown the setting, I want it to be real. And that's what The Child Garden does. We're introduced to Gloria, to her lonely (or self sufficient) life in a remote cottage, ten miles of single track road from the nearest town. To her old and beloved dog Walter Scott. To her house cats and her byre cats. To her tumbledown house - shabby, draughty, damp, remote, but safe.Or maybe not so safe. It isn't long before the action starts, before there's a pounding on Gloria's door one rainswept night and her life changes forever. An old friend is in trouble, and she agrees to help, putting herself outside the law and stepping into matters that definitely don't concern her.I loved Gloria as a character. She has stubbornness woven into her nature, whether in caring for her disabled child when abandoned by his father or in helping out that old friend, despite it bringing trouble down on her head. She has wounds - a vile parent and sister, that divorce - but she's bright, realistic about life and loves her dog and cats. Best of all she's a reader, the shelves of the old cottage stacked with books and story strewn with bookish references (indeed even the very title, which plays on Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses, some of which are quoted here).Gloria is a great character to spend time with. McPherson has perhaps given a little help here - she's got a job (local registrar) that is useful for finding out about people, there is the odd useful fall of snow (showing up footprints) and she has quite a bit of luck, but none of this is implausible. And she has a difficult quest - to work out what happened in the grounds of Eden all those years ago. The account in the prologue is tantalising but incomplete. Every one of the children who was there - every one who survived - has a version of their own, but what's the truth? And how does it explain what's happening now? I enjoyed Gloria's unravelling of this - necessarily constrained by practicalities like caring for Nicky, doing her job, and avoiding letting on to the police what she's up to.But beneath that mystery there's another which is older, darker and stranger. It concerns the Devil's Bridge in the grounds of Eden. The \"hallowed place\". The \"rocking stone\" behind Gloria's cottage. Does the pattern of that she's tracing have echoes in the geometry of an earlier tragedy? If it does, how can she hope to put things right? There are dark shadows here that are just right for a chilly Autumn evening.This is a thoroughly enjoyable mystery with a great setting, believable characters - the vignettes of the ex Eden children are excellent sketches of their varying, mostly sad, lives - and, especially in the final few chapters, a rising tension that makes the pages fly by faster and faster.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383239-autumn", "userReview": "I received this book via NetGalley to give an honest review.The cover and the title is what drove me to request this book. It seemed like it was going to be one of those edge of your seat thrillers, for me that was far from it. It was hard for me to truly get into the story and connect with any of the characters. Gloria lives right up the road from a care home where her son and her employer are being taken care of. Her son has PKNR which is pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, I had to look it up online to see what this was as Gloria never really tells us or Stig who comes into her life about it.While coming home after seeing her son Nicky her and another car almost collide this chain of events lead onto something even more than what Gloria expects. An old classmate Stig comes into the picture and is trying to figure out why the past of what happened at Eden is coming to life. Eden was a so called hippie school where a death occurred twenty eight years ago. Though the question is was it really an accident or murder? Gloria and Stig end up putting together pieces of the past it seems that all those that attended seem to be dying but is it all just a coincidence?I liked the setting of where a childhood death ends up being the mystery that becomes solved, I enjoyed the twist that came with this, the person in all of it was not someone I even thought of at all. The one person I kept thinking that was behind it all was just a victim as well.I liked the idea of the stone that you have to rock 12 times and no more if you go over you have to rock it 24 times. It is little superstitions like that which I enjoy in books. These things didn't work for me in the story. 1. Gloria bothered me quite a bit I understand she loves her son Nicky but she said his name a lot and I do not mean just in a conversation. More along the lines of just randomness. Here is one example: Stig and Gloria are in huttie and are looking around all of a sudden she thinks Nicky then they see something that has nothing to do with her son. Gloria just felt dull, which in her life style I can see this happening but it just didn't work for me. 2. Another that got to me was the fact that every time Stig would say thirty years ago she would reply with twenty-eight years. Either she should have just let it go or Stig should have listened to her and quit saying thirty. 3. The nicknames were just really out there though they did kind of stay with you. The correction that Stig had to keep giving Gloria for Van the Man she kept calling him Vanman which he would say no Van the Man. I mean Gloria it is not a hard nick name to remember. Other than those little things it was an okay story for me it is not truly dark at all just a mystery book with a nice twist. I am truly torn between a three and a four rating though I am going to go with a three."}, {"userName": "Kath", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5826296-kath", "userReview": "At the beginning of this book, the main character states that if she had to do it all again, she would do the same thing. I am glad she said that as quite early on through the book, I was really wondering why she was doing what she did but, following her early admission, I was happy to go with the flow. Gloria has a bit of a lonely life. She spreads her time between work as a registrar and visiting her son in the care home where he lives. He has a degenerative disease and lives his life totally unconscious and unaware. Gloria still reads to him every night and she also visits her benefactor, one Miss Drumm, the lady whose house she currently lives in, rent free but with certain conditions, one of which is that she rocks the standing stone 12 times every day. One night, an old primary school friend bangs her door and, upon entry, starts to spill a strange tale of a stalker and asking for Gloria's help. She agrees and soon becomes embroiled in something quite intriguing and, to put it mildly, very dangerous.I did love the intricate plotting of this book. How the author had Gloria, and indeed me as a reader, down several paths, believing certain things only to thrown in a switchback as more information is discovered. As the events of what happened to a bunch of school kids, sleeping out one night years ago started to become clear, we started to see secrets and lies being uncovered as the truth started to come to light, culminating in an ending that I really didn't see coming. I found the book to be written in a very atmospheric language and style so as to complement some of the spookiness of the narrative without overshadowing the story. Pacing was near on perfect after the first few pages, and the story kept me engaged, holding my attention nicely throughout.As already mentioned earlier, I did initially really question Gloria's actions and it is for this reason that I didn't quite gel with her as a character. Nearly, but not quite. I did sort of warm to Stig, as much as anyone could to that type of character but I found him to be easier to connect to than perhaps any of the others. All in all, this was a good solid read and I would definitely read the author again.I received a free ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Cathy Cole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5086649-cathy-cole", "userReview": "Having met the marvelous Catriona McPherson at 2016's Left Coast Crime, I was determined to give her books another try. I'd already read the first of her Dandy Gilver mysteries, but since I'm not a fan of Golden Age mysteries, After the Armistice Ball really wasn't my cup of tea. Anyway, back to the drawing board I went, and I discovered that McPherson has written several standalone suspense novels, and I chose The Child Garden. I'm glad I did. The character of Gloria Harkness almost immediately wrapped itself around my heart. Her young son Nicky is severely disabled, yet everything in Gloria's world revolves around him. If something goes wrong, her first thought is of how it will affect her son. She's chosen a job that will allow her to be with him everyday. She's found affordable housing close by. It would be almost impossible for me to remain completely unmoved by a woman who is so loving, so loyal... and so alone.McPherson weaves a palpable feeling of dread into this story. A feeling of isolation... of someone who has gone to ground and wants only to be safe and left alone. The second Gloria agrees to help her friend, everything begins to go wrong. She's just got that kind of luck, and McPherson's swift and sure pacing guides us through a downright diabolical plot. When the killer was revealed, I just shook my head. Of course! Now... why didn't I see that?Sometimes it can be very wise not to give up on an author. Even though I didn't enjoy her historical series featuring Dandy Gilver, I could tell that they were well-written and fit into that Golden Age style beautifully. (In other words, I could see the woman has talent.) When I learned that she writes novels in the modern, psychological suspense vein, I remembered that talent, and gave The Child Garden a try. This is when I struck pay dirt. I'm definitely reading more of her non-series work!"}, {"userName": "Bookandkook", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68411131-bookandkook", "userReview": "\u00c7ocuk Bah\u00e7esi'nin bitmesi normalden biraz uzun s\u00fcrd\u00fc.

It\u2019s been a couple of weeks and several books later since I read The Child Garden. However, I do remember how much I loved it. How many nights I stayed up late reading it.The Child Garden is the story of Gloria Harkness. Gloria is divorced and living at Rough House, a neglected old home in the Scottish countryside. She has a son with PKAN (had to look that up) at a nearby care facility. Also at that facility is Mrs. Drume, the actual owner of Rough House. Gloria gets to stay in Rough House rent free in exchange for taking care of Mrs. Drume\u2019s older dog and also for remembering to \u201crock the stone\u201d.

When an old friend, Stig Tarrant, shows up at her doorstep, Gloria\u2019s boring life becomes filled with tension and intrigue. While there may be plenty of magic and mystery in ancient Scotland, what is happening now is not the work of Scottish spirits, but very real, flesh and blood humans.This is a wonderful atmospheric novel, with plenty of twists and turns.

I couldn't quite find it in myself to understand why the main female character did things the way she did. I wanted to connect with her but I couldn't quite get there.The mystery part of the story was not bad, although again a bit slow to get going and long winded at times. I have to say I preferred the last quarter of the story a lot more than the first three quarters as the mystery side of it started to pick up pace as we headed towards the final chapters. The red herrings which the author threw in were all so plausible that I believed them, that is until she did the actual reveal and it all made sense. The ending itself was written really well, the author has done a good job at hiding the truth until she is ready to reveal it.For fans of mystery, myths and legends this may well be a much better story for them than it was for me.
