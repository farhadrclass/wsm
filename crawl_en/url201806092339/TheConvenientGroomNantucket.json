What girl doesn\u2019t like the idea of a handsome groom swooping in to the rescue?\u201cThe Convenient Groom\u201d has an amazing premise. Talk about romance! The hero is simply delicious, talk about attraction- and I\u2019m not necessarily referring to the heroine. *grin* As the attraction grows between Lucas and Kate, the tension feels like two opposing magnets. They get closer and closer until the reader is literally holding her breath and then something rips them apart. My favorite scene in the entire story is when Kate finds herself snuggling with Lucas (they are married), but what ensues is just laugh-out-loud funny! You have to read the book to find out more, but let me say this\u2026it sizzles and the humor\u2026oh my.What I love the most about this book though is the message. The message of God\u2019s love being all encompassing no matter what we might do. Yes, the romance makes my fingers quiver from the pulse of my heart as I read and I laugh out more than once, but it\u2019s the story within the story that makes it powerful.This book is one of the very best, among my top favorites (and I don\u2019t say that about many books). You won\u2019t be disappointed! Highly recommended!!!This review is my honest opinion. Thanks to the publishers for my copy to review."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50448-becky", "userReview": "Kate Lawrence, or \"Dr. Kate,\" is ready to have her big day: not only is she finally getting married, her book is being released. What kind of book? A book about love, relationships, dating, and marriage. This \"expert\" is, however, about to be shamed in front of the world because her intended groom, Bryan Montgomery is a no show. Not only is he getting cold feet and backing out, he is shacking up with another woman, Stephanie. (He actually calls her when he's in this woman's bed.) What's a girl to do when she's got everything prepared for the big day except the groom? Well, if she's the heroine of a fiction novel, she's going to find another groom, and quickly. Luckily her friend, Lucas, is there to step into place.Lucas is excited to be the groom, in fact, because he's secretly loved Kate from afar. But can this marriage of convenience transition into the real thing? Or will someone who knows the truth spill the beans? Will Kate's book be a success or a flop? Will Kate realize how useless she is in this love game? Will she see what a great man Lucas is and stop whining and pining for Bryan?I liked this one well enough. It was cute in places. And Lucas sounded like a great guy.But. And this really has nothing to do with the quality of the story itself. I just found myself questioning why this book was 'Christian.' It's published by a Christian publishing house, yes. And it is mostly smut-free. I mean the reader knows that Bryan is carrying on an affair behind-the-scenes. And it's never exactly stated one way or the other if Bryan had been intimate with Kate in the past. I presumed as much since the topic of her virginity never came up. But I don't know what the author intended. So don't take my word for it by any means. And any intimacies that occur between Kate and Lucas happen after the 'I do's' even if those occur before any declarations of love. So I don't have a problem necessarily with the content. It's more what is not in the book.Not all Christian books have a focus on God, on having a personal relationship with Jesus as Savior and/or Lord. But usually, there is something--even if it's not the main focus of the book. No mention of God. No mention of personal faith. No church. No bible study. No bible reading. No prayers. No spiritual insights or 'aha' moments when she realizes that she needs God or wants God. We have a slightly shallow woman who is trying to do it all and be it all without seeking God, without turning to Him. There is nothing in the pages of this book that would give the reader any indication that the characters were Christian excepting the fact that it's a Christian publisher that some may recognize as such...and excepting page 299 where the author's note to the reader mentions that Lucas's love for Kate is meant to represent Christ's love for us. That Jesus can be any woman's knight in shining armor. A statement that leaves me slightly puzzled."}, {"userName": "Christa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/261662-christa", "userReview": "What would you do if you were a relationship expert on finding the right mate - with a syndicated column and a book due to be released on your wedding day - and your fiance jilts you five hours before the wedding? This is the dilemma that Kate Lawrence faces in The Convenient Groom: A Nantucket Love Story. This is the touching story of a woman who finds out that she has much to learn about love, and the man who continues to love her through all of her ups and downs. Kate Lawrence's personal and professional life are on the verge of collapse as her fiance announces a few hours before the wedding that he is in love with another woman. Kate's publisher planned her wedding to coincide with her book release on finding the perfect spouse, and now the world will know how she abysmally failed at choosing her own mate. Kate knows that not only will she have to deal with heartbreak, but also with the collapse of her career when the news is made public. Kate's professional life is salvaged as Lucas Wright, her landlord, steps up and offers to marry her. Kate's publicist has withheld the name of the groom from the media so Lucas' offer sounds like a lifeline to Kate, and she agrees to a temporary marriage. What Kate doesn't know is that the only reason Lucas married her is because of the unrequited love he has for her. As Kate and Lucas settle into their platanic marriage, she rebuffs most of his attempts to become closer. As complete opposites, Kate knows that she and Lucas could never be happy together on a permanent basis. When Kate finally starts to relax with Lucas, events unfold that cause her professional life to crash. As Kate tries to pick up the pieces of her life, she has much to learn about love.This was an enjoyable book with a wonderfully sweet hero. Lucas loves Kate throughout the book and will do anything to protect and help her. Kate was a mostly likeable heroine, but there were times when I became impatient with her unswavering refusal to see what she really had with Lucas. When I first read about this book, it was listed as a Christian romance. There is nothing overtly Christian in the book, but the author's letter in the back describes Lucas' love for Kate as an allegory for Christ's love for us. If you like a sweet romance with a bit of angst, this one is for you."}, {"userName": "Aerykah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5920961-aerykah", "userReview": "Pretty good, but I'll admit that I mostly liked this story for the hero.

When starting this book, can't put it down until I've read the first 50 pages :) ** (originally read May 22, 2015) finished once again and would give it ANOTHER five stars!!**this book is being made into a HALLMARK movie, coming in JUNE!!!!! MUST SEE :) See Denise Hunter's author page on facebook for details**Wow, what a wonderful book! Reminded me A LOT of the movie, While You Were Sleeping with Sandra Bullock (one of my absolute faves) :) Kate gets dumped hours before her wedding and even though she marries Lucas as a last minute solution, she is questioning herself throughout. Her heart is tremendous and I just loved her in this story! Lucas IS a hero, but he also has a wonderful family that fully supports Kate even though his parents weren't even at the wedding since it was so last minute arranged. However, his family accepts her as one of their own and I was touched more than once seeing how much they love Kate. Also, couldn't STAND Dylan, a loser from the beginning but he is so well written as an unlikable character.I almost read this in one sitting, I simply had to see what happened next, LOOOOOOVE when that happens :) THIS is the type of romance book that really blesses me and the kind of sweetness I want to read in all romance books. I got this copy from the library, but I might buy it.

I thought the plot was well developed... Denise definitely tied everything together quite well. I think what I love most about this book was the \"initial\" interaction between Kate and Lucas. I just adore love stories that happen between irritated characters... in this case, Kate was the only one annoyed. I loved Lucas from the get-go. I mean let's be honest... he's tall, has longish hair, broad-shouldered, and he's a carpenter/builder. WHAT?!?!?! Okay, I know I'm being ridiculous, but I can't help it.This was another well written piece by Denise Hunter. I have quite a few favorite parts in this book that had me down right laughing and swiping tears from the corners of my eyes... I'm probably not the only one who laughed out loud at the cuddling scene. I continually replay it in my mind and it's just as funny as the first time I read it...

But nothing could be further from the truth. It is a common practice as it might have been in times past. The only difference, perhaps, lies in the fact that no one talks about it openly while it remains an open-secret. And mind you, no one is na\u00efve enough to admit it. But marriage as a commodity is of high value.Award-winning author Denise Hunter comes up with an exciting Christian romance certain to keep you glued to the pages till the very end. Published by Thomas Nelson, The Convenient Groom is an inspiring story of healing, hope, and enduring love set in romantic Nantucket.Imagine yourself as celebrity marriage counselor Dr. Kate Lawrence. Imagine that you are just five hours away from your dream beach wedding. Imagine that your book Finding Mr. Right-for-You is to hit the stands in a few hours' time. Imagine that you have created such an image for yourself that the New York Times is sending a reporter and a photographer just to cover your wedding. Imagine the excitement and the pulse pumping furiously. Imagine...Imagine your groom-to-be calling you, and saying, \"I can't marry you,\" but adding an ironic \"I'll always care about you.\"The Convenient Groom follows the shame, hurt and dilemma that faces Dr. Kate Lawrence when her Mr. Right backed out of the wedding. It is no ordinary situation to be in. A relationship expert with a syndicated column, the last-minute cancellation of her own wedding would be the end of her career.How can a person who failed at choosing her own mate offer to give advice to others?The book is also about healing, forgiveness and discovering true love in the most unlikely places. A farce was enacted conveniently with the wedding taking place as arranged and things went smoothly until the lover who jilted Kate for another girl jilted her too.Everything went up in smoke. Will Kate survive it? And what about the convenient groom? How will their story unfold?If you are into a clean romance with an interesting story-line, this one is for you."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1581374-suzanne", "userReview": "I thought this was a fairly conventional romance story, though it's housed in the \"inspirational\" section of the local public library.

After all the online discussions about the Hallmark movie based on this book I decided it was time to catch up on this 2008 classic. If I had to sum up this story in a few words it would be -- tenderness and angst. Usually in equal doses but I'll admit to feeling more trepidation on Lucas's behalf even as I swooned over his unwavering love for Kate. And she is blithely unaware even thought she's celebrated as a relationship counselor extraordinaire! But that's 'cause Kate hardly ever looks up from her to-do lists to take any notice. Their journey to a happily-ever-after is plagued with misunderstandings which kept my heart all aflutter as I urged them on.

I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. The main characters, Kate and Lucas, didn't interest me at all. They weren't, in my opinion, very interesting. This book is not meant for young girls. There is definitely mature content that I won't advise anyone to read. It is not terrible, but I don't love it. I don't recommend this book, and would rate it a one and a half star if I could.
