PUZZLES!! LOCK-INS!!fun times one million.oh, and this is the author's note:Is the game really over?Maybe not.There is one more puzzle in the book that wasn't in the story. (Although a clue about how to find it was!)If you figure out the solution, let me know.and then he gives his email address. and so now i have to read it again, because i wanna solve this hidden puzzle!very smart, indeed, grabenstein\u2026very. smart. indeed."}, {"userName": "Marjorie Ingall", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1249329-marjorie-ingall", "userReview": "WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU EVERYONE WHO LIKED THIS I FEEL LIKE DONALD SUTHERLAND IN INVASION OF TEH BODY SNATCHERS YOU ARE ALL PODS. It gets one star because it has the word LIBRARY in the title. I like libraries.But Chris Grabenstein does not. At least, he doesn't like libraries qua libraries. His version of an ideal library is like being floo-powdered into World of Warcraft then spiked with Disneyland and dosed with Ritalin. The book talks the talk about the awesomeness of libraries but then shows-don't-tells that libraries need to be TV. The characters are pancake-flat. The dialogue is crawl-under-the-rug lame. I was a mature enough parent that I did not suggest a drinking game involving doing a shot every time Miguel Fernandez said \"bro,\" BUT I THOUGHT IT. The whole enterprise just seemed so CYNICAL, a naked ploy to sell books to librarians by sucking up to them while actually pulling the beeping/flashing/green-screened wool over their eyes. It depressed me. It name-dropped a zillion book titles without ever conveying the transformative joy of simply READING.We read this at bedtime -- my 12-year-old and I hate-bonded about how bad it was while my 9-year-old was utterly transfixed, so take that as you will. Also, the 12-year-old (and I) figured out really early in the book what the means of escape was going to be so having to WAIT FOR IT was maddening. I don't know how to upload pictures so IMAGINE DONALD SUTHERLAND POINTING AND DOING THAT GRRAAAAAAA THING AT YOU. Oh, hey, I can LINK!ADDENDUM, THREE YEARS LATER: I regret being so bitchy about this book. I loathed it, true, but lemme repeat the part about \"my nine-year-old was utterly transfixed,\" which, jeez, should have been my takeaway. IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT ME; GROW UP, ME. Maxie went on to give this book to her friends for their birthdays, and ALL OF THEM loved it. So, uh, give it to your 9-year-old independent reader and DON'T READ IT ALOUD AT BEDTIME, problem solved."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "If you like your reads to be partially interactive, this one\u2019s for you. The interaction is done on the reader\u2019s part, so you can decide not to take part of the game and still enjoy the book, but by playing along with the characters, you become even more invested. I honestly did not care to play the game along with the characters, because it slowed the pace at which I was reading, but in hindsight, I think I should have, because the rebus is an important element of the story.Still, I found this to be highly addictive and simply a breath of fresh air. There\u2019s always something going on in the story, and there\u2019s a clear progression in regards to both the storyline and game. I enjoyed seeing the later divide people, only to bring them back together later in the game.The characters aren\u2019t complex, but I wouldn\u2019t accuse them of being one-dimensional. It\u2019s true that we lack background on them\u2014except for a few exceptions\u2014but their personalities are distinct.This book could have been about Mr. Lemoncello alone and I still would have read it. He\u2019s that great. His personality is unique and he\u2019s just so much fun. I often wanted to know what was inside his head. He was surprising and a delightful man to be around. What a treasurable book that promotes board games. I\u2019ll be sure to read it again in a few years and this time around invest myself much more in the game.

I loved trying to solve all the puzzles and clues along with the characters, but aside from that I had a few problems with it. Of course, this book is written for 8-12 year olds, and the writing definitely reflected that. Because the plot was so fun, it was easy to ignore the inconsistencies in the characters, and their one-dimensional natures, but now that I'm finished I can see those issues clearly.Overall, a very entertaining, easy read. I recommend it! Just don't go into it expecting well crafted characters."}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina", "userReview": "Lately I have been on an easy reading kick. I think I get this way every late winter. That being said, my kids had this book from the library for a reread and told me it is a great book and I should read it. I give this 4.5 stars because it is a great kids book, but to paraphrase my daughter, nothing is as good as Harry Potter. Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library is a fun book for middle grade kids. The town of Alexandriaville, Ohio has not had a public library in 12 years, and millionaire toy maker Luigi Lemoncello has sponsored a new, state of the art library. For a grand opening he has invited 12 twelve year olds to spend the night and then take part in a survivor type game to escape from the library. The winner will get to star in his tv commercials. Our protagonist is Kyle Keeley the younger brother to overachieving Curtis and sports star Mike. Lost in their limelight, Kyle finally has his turn to shine as he takes part in the library escape. As he forms an alliance with his friends, Kyle works to solve Lemoncello's clues in order to win the game. I admit I was not a Willy Wonka fan as a kid so I can't compare the two books. Being the book worm that I am, I enjoyed the state of the art library, the references to classic and contemporary kids books, and the Dewey decimal system. I also thought it was refreshing to see kids working together positively. I would recommend this book to older elementary aged kids, even those who don't read much. It is a fun read and will hopefully encourage kids to read more than they had been before reading this book."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4063913-beth", "userReview": "This is a messy, loud book crammed full of one-note characters, dizzying book references, and an illogical plot. There is no nuance, no suspense, and no character growth. This is the story of a puzzle, not the story of the people solving it - much to the book's detriment. The Westing Game would be a better choice; in fact, it's entirely possible that book was name-dropped in this one. There were so many awkward book references shoehorned into the story that I honestly couldn't keep track.And I'm confused as to why a library would need a director of holographic imagery. Just buy more books."}, {"userName": "The Library Lady", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady", "userReview": "I cannot understand all the 4 star reviews and the NY Times best seller status of this book. Then again, most of what I find on the children's best seller list lately is mediocre junk!This is yet another rip-off of Roald Dahl's immortal Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, complete with an eccentric inventor and a contest, only this time with a superduper library instead of a factory.Here there is one \"bad\" kid, plus a few others who have their faults, and while they don't meet heinous fates, they all lose. The winners, of course, are the \"good\" kids, plus one who could go either way, but proves to be a \"good\" kid in the end. Luigi Lemoncello is no match for Willy Wonka, and the endless, ENDLESS insertion of book titles or references is as irritating as product placement in a movie.And yes, there is a \"Wonka\" reference, but to add insult to injury it's to the movie--and probably to the crappy remake with Johnny Depp!Utterly, utterly, predictable. Is it the libary/reading theme that is making all the librarians and educators kvell?P.S. The technological references will help this book go stale in no time flat."}, {"userName": "Kristine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4731250-kristine", "userReview": "Whenever I see a book about a library, I tend to order it for the collection at my library. This was one of the best things to come from this whim! Perfect for both the reluctant reader and avid bibliophile, Escape From Mr. Lemoncello's Library had me hooked even as an adult.Twelve 12-year-olds are selected for an overnight experience at their new public library. Little do they know, this is actually a set-up for the time of their lives. When the overnight is over, they find themselves locked-in. Their only hope is to figure out the clues and piece together the puzzles in order to win the ultimate prize.Kyle was a great character. Realistically flawed yet a good role model for readers. The peripheral characters were also charmingly well-developed and really added to the story. Plus, where to even start on the setting? It was spectacularly fantastical, mixing just enough eccentricity in with reality to make it extraordinarily possible. I only hope kids aren't disappointed when their own libraries aren't quite as amazing (which is a mostly sarcastic observation).I loved the seamless way learning was woven into the story. There is so much to discover about Dewey classification, the help librarians offer, and the fun that reading can be. Grabenstein's description of the kids getting caught up reading about Sherlock was almost tangible. This is children's literature, but it's not lazy in the least. Yet it's also completely accessible. It was fast-paced and had a good flow to it.As others have mentioned, it reminded me of a cross between The Westing Game and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. However, I think I enjoyed this one more as it didn't have the pretentious, dark edge those two presented (more so the latter). This was just a fun jaunt through the library with a good heart, great lessons, and fun for all!"}, {"userName": "Bennett", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16733095-bennett", "userReview": "Grade rating: 67% DA super huge library is any book lover's dream! But this or comes with a catch...I didn't really like this one.The author was annoying, first of all. He was trying to make his characters seem like the kids of today. When Charles said \"I'll Twitter it\", my spine shuddered is disgust. Also, the author kept making references to books. New books, not just the classics. I don't think references to recent literature should never happen, but I feel it's out of place. That got annoying real quick.Second, it was so predictable. Kyle's team won, blah blah blah. The book needed more twists. Wouldn't it be better if Haley revealed at the end that she joined Kyle's team just to get the answers and win, because her want of being a commercial star consumed her? That would have been amazing. Also, the narrator should have focused on each character equally, and there shouldn't have been teams, so you didn't know who would win.At the beginning, Sierra was my kind of character. Shy, bookish, and quiet. Then she joined a team and that all went away. She became someone she wasn't. No. That's not right. I was positive she would win because she was the underdog. Also, Charles's elimination was meaningless. If he broke a rule a long time ago in the game, why did they take him out of the game just then? Unbelievable. He should have been there until the end, then Kyle's team would pull ahead and Charles would lose.In the end, an odd little story with annoyances everywhere and un-needed references. There were plenty of other book I would have rather been reading."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12293609-kate", "userReview": "You know, I think Grabenstein missed an opportunity to have a great book instead of just a good one. The puzzles and mysteries were fantastically well-placed and a lot of fun to try to solve alongside Kyle and his friends, and I liked the positive teamwork message the book had to send. As a librarian, I absolutely adored the positive library portrayal, the fact that it was a place that was fun and exciting and the clever way the Dewey Decimal system was used in the book. But to an extent, it seemed like that was where Grabenstein stopped trying - with creating the puzzles and mysteries the children had to solve and with incorporating the library aspects. He stopped short of fleshing out the characters much, or giving them any time to do anything other than solve the puzzles or (in the adults' case) hand out clues. This was enjoyable, but I found myself disappointed and wishing that Kyle and his friends had been given the careful treatment that the excellent plot indicated that they deserved."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202724-jessica", "userReview": "A very fun book, especially for bookworms.

Unfortunately, some people might decide not to bother with reading this book since it seems too reminiscent of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\" But before you make any hasty decisions, I'm glad to inform you Chris Grabenstein readily addresses the similarities and in quite an amusing manner. There were multiple references to books scattered throughout, which I found quite delightful. How could you not enjoy a book that's meant to teach children the wonderful joys and hidden treasures contained within a public library? Technology was woven throughout this book, but it was done in such a manner that showed how it can be used for good and not bad. I guess sometimes technology is considered so much more exciting than books it makes me worry what the future may hold. I wonder if one day kids will forgo books entirely for video games. Luckily, this book gave me the hope to think otherwise. I really enjoyed seeing Kyle's interest in reading flourish. It didn't take him too long to realize books are just as good as \"watching a 3-D IMAX movie in his head.\"I thought some of the trivia and questions might be pretty hard for 12 year olds, especially considering most kids nowadays don't even know the slightest thing about \"Hawaii Five-O\" or Agatha Christie. Shoot, some of the questions were hard for me! I could be wrong though ;p. There were a lot of good messages scattered throughout this book as well. I won't spoil them for you, but I was glad to see there were repercussions and rewards for the children's behavior. The riddles were truly enjoyable and I found myself scrambling to figure them out as well.If you love books, then \"Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library\" is a definite must read!P.S. - There's even an unsolved mystery mentioned at the end of the book!

I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy and the kids at my library will be able to read the final version in only 11 days. I can't wait to hear their reactions! :)So, for starters, Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library is brilliant. It has all the wonder, imagination, and wackiness of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory or Merganzer Whippet's hotel (Patrick Carman's Floors), and yet it takes place in a library. As the 12 competitors try to solve the puzzle, they (and the reader) are confronted with some very clever codes, clues, and rebuses. The hunt takes them all over the library, so they learn about authors, books, and Dewey Decimal Classification. At the same time, though, the information is so well-placed that readers won't even realize they are learning. Like Kyle, though, they may have a list of books they'd like to look at once they finish this one! The book emphasizes teamwork, loyalty, fair play, reading, libraries, puzzles, and problem-solving. It is very fast-paced, as the competition takes place over a 24-hour period, and I can't picture any kid finding it unexciting. It is also quite amusing. I particularly enjoyed the fabulous puns using book titles that our wacky game maker, Mr. Lemoncello, comes up with.I would recommend Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library to fans of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Floors, The Westing Game, and fans of mystery and adventure in general. Frankly, I would recommend it to any kid. It fits in any public, school, or home library. It would be great fun for family or classroom reading as well as individual reading. It's a perfect book to take to the beach or on a summer road trip, too. Kids who read this book will wish they could visit Alexandriaville's new public library. I sure did! And librarians should be prepared for fans of life-size games (life-size chess, Clue, etc.) to request to play a version of Mr. Lemoncello's game. I'm already trying to figure out how we could make this ultimate scavenger hunt/clue search/adventure work at my library."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 3.75* of five, rounded up because DAMN!Want to know something?

Oh okay: I did NOT hate reading this book OR its sequel!I know, right?Chris Grabenstein writes for middle-graders like a middle-grader would, and I mean that as a compliment. He gets right into the mindset of a young person in a way that I don't see a lot of adult writers doing. He anticipates the questions a younger reader is most likely going to ask and, before they can even be posed consciously, leads the reader to the answer while making it seem they've gotten ahead of the author. That's quality writing for any age, let alone the finicky and detail-oriented 9-to-12 market."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/351657-susan", "userReview": "+ 1/2 star just because it's hard to feel too snarky about a book that so unabashedly oozes such love for libraries and games.I think this is the book that my 8-12 year-old self had always hoped for--if I could have written a book then it would be something like the world in this book. Some of my favorite books back then incorporated quirkiness and puzzles and word play. I loved the Westing Game and The Phantom Tollbooth and I wanted to love this book--because how could you not love the idea of a group of kids locked in at a library overnight, competing in this epic challenge competition where they get to live out a board game? The thing is though, with Raskin, and Dahl, and Konigsburg is there was always sort of an underlying edge somewhere-some poignancy, or a little darkness, or a wry little twist. Heck, Dahl could be pretty freaking disturbing when he wanted to be. There's a reason Johnny Depp was a little off-putting as Willy Wonka, and also a reason that Gene Wilder immortalized the role. He perfected that weirdly fine line between giddiness and cynicism by balancing his own good natured affability and sweetness with the Willy Wonka bite. In contrast, Mr. Lemoncello (and his book) are basically Gene Wilder sans bite. The game guru is basically just an overgrown kid in a candy store-or in this case--a library. Grabenstein was clearly inspired by these other books and authors and references abound, but without the nuance of the shading, all the enthusiasm and giddiness starts to feel a little contrived after awhile. Rather than have the book work so hard to sell the fact that reading is fun and libraries are wondrous places, I think it would make it even better if the game and personalities of the characters could be given a little more detail and distinction.Fans of the Candy Shop Wars could give this a try."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/876373-lauren", "userReview": "I loved this book! To me, it was a love letter to libraries and books in general. As a librarian, I loved how Grabenstein showed how much fun finding information can be. I also appreciated that our protagonist Kyle was presented as a non-reader in the beginning, but evolved into a reader by the end after both talking to kids who liked to read and also picking up a book himself. Grabenstein also very cleverly and very subtly inserted a reading list for people who read this book. Several titles are mentioned along with short descriptions that would get people interested in them. I made sure to talk to the 5th and 6th graders in my community about this book and I was thrilled at how excited the kids were to check the book out. Taking my librarian hat off, I still enjoyed the book. It had a nice mystery/puzzle for the kids to solve and the characters themselves were pretty interesting as well. There were no \"completely good\" kids. They all had flaws and I appreciated that not every kid wanted to participate in the escape contest. Some just didn't want to while others had previous commitments. This made the characters seem much more realistic. I would have given this book 5 stars except for two things. One, the villain was a bit over-the-top to the point of being tiresome. Two, there was a portion towards the end that felt a tiny bit like a deus ex machina. On the one hand, it is believable, but on the other hand, it's a tad too convenient. Regardless, it's a fantastic read."}, {"userName": "Mari Anne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1663741-mari-anne", "userReview": "LOVED this book!! What's not to love??? Basically a MG re-working of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" but with an eccentric game maker and set in a LIBRARY!!! Not just any library either, but a state of the art, amazing, magnificent library with holograms, digital ceilings, mag lev lifts to retrieve books shelved high in the air, a gaming room and food! I really, really, really want to go to Mr. Lemoncello's library! Peppered with fun puzzles, anagrams, rubrics and literally DOZENS of literature references, this is a young bibliophile's dream book. While this book will have HUGE appeal among librarians and young book lovers, I also think that it is entertaining enough to keep just about anyone reading. Do I smell a Newberry? I certainly hope so as this one is pure fun with a lot of information sneakily thrown in. Kids will be absorbing information about the Dewey Decimal system and library organization and barely even know it! Heee heeee heeee... sneaky Chris Grabenstein! Highly recommended for grades 3 - 6... not sure of its appeal for older middle graders. It might seem a little too young for them."}, {"userName": "Karen \u2022 The Book Return", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11442737-karen-the-book-return", "userReview": "This is a kind of a new twist on Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but better because it's in a library. I want to say that I not much of a middle grade reader but I am trying to get my kids to love reading and I am rereading some books that I loved as a kid. I say this on the library website and it seemed fascinating to me so I thought I would give it a short. I loved the characters and the games but my favorite was all the literary figures, authors, and books, that were worked into the story. It was also so much fun solving the puzzles in the books and made the story move very quickly. I would recommend for middle grade but also a fun light read for adults.My blog"}, {"userName": "\u263c\u264e Carmen the Bootyshaker Temptress \u263c\u264e", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16935457-carmen-the-bootyshaker-temptress", "userReview": "Rated 3.5This book was some kind of library Willy Wonka type of theme.

It is full of puzzles and clues to the mystery. It also makes many references to modern books and websites as well as classic literature and it's authors. This book is about a group of children who win an essay contest and, as a reward, are granted early access to the town's new library. This library was designed by the rather eccentric, famed, game creator, Mr. Luigi Lemoncello. When they arrive at the library, however, they are told that they have a chance to participate in a new game, called 'Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library'. These children have 24 hours to find their way to a hidden exit in the library. The winner stars in Mr. Lemoncello's commercials. I enjoyed how the books switched viewpoints from the different teams, and you were able to have more clues to work the puzzle yourself than the characters in the book had. I really enjoyed the book references made in the story. 'The Mixed up Files of Mrs. Basil. E. Frankweiler', Pseudonymous Bosch, 'Sherlock Holmes', and 'The Rats of Nimh' were all mentioned. Having read any of these may have given you more hints. I found myself trying to figure out clues and rebuses before reading to see what the characters actually thought about them. I am pleased that the characters who cheated, lied, or even those who were rough with the books and other contestants, were eliminated. In some books I have read things like those go unpunished, and it upsets me because it teaches that lying and cheating is O.K when it isn't. I am incredibly glad I was able to read this before the publishing date, and I am looking forward to any books this author may write. Fans of literature everywhere would enjoy this fantastic book.

This book is overflowing with layered puzzles and literary references masquerading as Dad jokes. The flat and throw away characters and the overtop pandering to library land had me as an adult who works in libraries bored. BUT it went over well with the the bookworms of my Tween Book Club. It was light and fun and they loved the idea of such a tricked out library. We had a fun conversation about their reading, technology, and gaming habits. And this book earns a star for allowing me to collect that market research. The book club also went crazy pants for the scavenger hunt on the author's website. This game lead to some great teachable moments about Dewey and nonfiction vs fiction and the catalog and what not. This book wouldn't change any kids worldview and the new technology angle wouldn't have it on shelves for long. But I think this book could be fun for 4th-6th graders and can be a good jumping for library skills."}, {"userName": "Kate Willis", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56441586-kate-willis", "userReview": "I\u2019m a fan of Willy Wonka. I\u2019m also a fan of The Westing Game, Night in the Museum, National Treasure, and the first Brixton Brothers book. This book had elements of all of these and ended up being pretty fun. :DOkay, libraries are pretty cool to start with, but I\u2019m not sure any can compare to this one. There\u2019s a hoverboard for checking out books on higher shelves, holographic statues, and huge screens on the ceiling to represent the Dewey decimal system. And much more. At first, especially during the construction scenes, I had trouble picturing the library since it is pretty bizarre, but after awhile I was able to build a picture in my head. ;) The games were very fun and clever, though not too hard that a middle-grade reader couldn\u2019t enjoy trying to solve them along with the characters. There were a ton of literary references too. :D :D Mr. Lemoncello talks almost entirely in book titles, and reading a couple Sherlock Holmes\u2019 short stories helped the characters figure out a clue. (A+ for that!) Mrs. Tobin is the classic librarian. I really liked the concept of learning to appreciate and use all the tools a library has to offer. (I think we miss what a goldmine they are sometimes.) I feel like I should learn the Dewey decimal system now. XD The characters were pretty cool, and Kyle was a great protagonist. My favorite part though was how compassion, teamwork, and determination were what in the end won the game. (Thanks to some bonus clues. :D) Just a note, there are a few instances of mean children and a couple slang words.Best quote: \u201cCongratulations, Rose!\u201d cried Mr. Lemoncello, who had put on a pointy party hat. \u201cFor sticking to your prior commitments, you will receive our special Prior Commitment Sticker prize: a complete set of Lemoncello Sticker Picture Games and a laptop computer to play them on! Enjoy.\u201dAltogether, this book kept me amused and guessing. ;)"}, {"userName": "Barb Middleton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton", "userReview": "I went into a convenience store this morning and there on a stool was an African Gray Parrot bobbing in circles as it waited for its owner to check out at the counter. I live in Taiwan where it is common seeing dogs in grocery stores, restaurants, or pushed in baby strollers dolled up with bows and human clothes, but I've never seen a parrot. I found myself sitting on the stool next to it asking the gorgeous creature if it knew English, then feeling silly. It probably isn't a talking parrot. It strutted about whistling and clicking before stopping to poop on the stool. \"Not the answer I expected,\" I laughed. The owner made a scolding noise and came to clean it up. In Mr. Lemoncello's high tech library there are robot geese that can imitate \"Walter the Farting Dog.\" These six mechanical geese with a showcased Mother Goose tell other stories but Walter's unique sound effects make him the most memorable. From holograms to automatons, this is one Disney-like library that would get any kid excited about reading. Kids would get excited about the unpredictability and beauty of an African Gray pooping parrot too. A new 500 million dollar library is opening in Alexandriaville by a billionaire maker of cardboard and video games, Mr. Lemoncello. Twelve students at the local school can write an essay to spend a free night locked in the library. Kyle decides at the last minute to write his essay and doesn't seem to know what a special library this is going to be. I didn't understand how Kyle completely missed the importance of the essay because there would have been quite a bit of media hoopla and his best friends all wrote essays - but no matter. It's just one of many questions I had regarding the characters and plot. Kyle quickly writes an essay and emails it to Mr. Lemoncello shortly after the deadline. This allows the author to send the message of not giving up even when the situation looks hopeless.Kyle gets chosen as one of the twelve students who gets to spend the night in the library playing video games, reading books, and playing games. His best friends are with him and once the night is over, Mr. Lemoncello introduces a new game where the students have to figure out how to escape the library. This winner will be a spokesperson for his company. The race is on to win the game and this is the fun of this book; the mystery of solving different games. The characters don't change internally and the tension comes mainly from one boy, Charles, who is one-dimensional and manipulates others in order to win the game. Charles has no code of honor and is willing to cheat, betray, and steal to win.People who are competitive want to win games and while Charles wanted to win-at-all-costs, Kyle's team knew how to honor the game and learn from their mistakes. Mr. Lemoncello gave bonus points when the players chose character, such as being responsible or helpful, over winning the game. Characters were also kicked out when they tried to cheat. Kyle's team chose effort over outcome, whereas Charles only thought of winning at the expense of those around him. The ending might have been more powerful if something happened to Charles and Kyle's team let him win in order to show character is more important. Sports and games are about life lessons and how to be a better person and what it means to lose. Once Charles was out of the picture I thought the tension dropped too many notches. The story was still fun, but it lost momentum for me at that point."}], "description": "A New York Times BestsellerKyle Keeley is the class clown, popular with most kids, (if not the teachers), and an ardent fan of all games: board games, word games, and particularly video games.
