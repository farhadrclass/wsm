This book is just what the modern world of children's books needed. And it should be in classrooms everywhere. I think it's just wonderful. Highly educational, and a lot of fun too. My favourite one is This Little Piggy, but there are many favourites such as Baa Baa Black Sheep, and Old MacDonald. The good thing about these rhymes is that they show children more about the lives animals lead. Old MacDonald is another interesting one, because it explores all the different things that farmers grow in fields, so it is more educational than the original. Very good."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64689206-jessica", "userReview": "Awards: NoneGrade: Pre KSummary: A vegan spin-off of already established Nursery Rhymes.
