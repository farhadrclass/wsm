But with the publication of J. M. Coetzee's latest novel, The Childhood of Jesus (Harvill Secker, London; Viking, New York) I am moved to address the issue of reader engagement or, shall we say, responsibility. That responsibility begins by reading a work of fiction on its own terms. That is, with an open mind. Professional reviewers have been put off by the apparent strangeness of this novel, but I sometimes think it is the job of such people to be put off, to find fault, to interpret beyond their means to justify their existence. But \u2026 what about the reader? When one buys a book it would seem that one is entering into contract with one's self and with the author; a contract of respect for the intelligences involved on both sides. Scanning the commentaries of amazon.com buyers, I made a list of some of the titles these individuals gave their reviews: funny little book; more of the same; a strange land and a slow read; searching for utopia; a hollow egg and, my personal favorite, well crafted, but unfathomable and at times tedious. Of course, for a book to be unfathomable -if by that one means profound, immeasurable, enigmatic- it must, by force, be well crafted. Reading each of these \"reviews\" what was immediately evident, to me, was the unwillingness of the readers to be challenged beyond the easy and the conventional, the sentimental, the entertaining, the expected.I have been reading Coetzee since he became internationally known with the publication of his third novel Waiting for the barbarians. I was very young and filled with ideas of how the world should be. That novel was painful to read, but the stark beauty of its prose, which I have never forgotten, indicated that indeed there was beauty above and beyond the cruelty depicted within its pages. That beauty was Truth. Echoing Beckett's vision of life with no consolation, no dignity, no promise of grace, Coetzee has written that, in the face of it all, the only duty we have is \"not to lie to ourselves.\" Truth is beauty. With each successive book Coetzee has maintained that line, expanded the search for Truth. In my experience, not a single one of his books has been \"more of the same,\" and never \"a hollow egg.\"So we come to The Childhood of Jesus. A man and a small boy have arrived at Novilla after an apparently perilous journey during which the boy has \"lost\" his mother. Novilla, a Spanish land devoid of all possible amenities, where politeness abounds but friendliness is negligible, it is the land one arrives at after everywhere else has, apparently, failed. In its anodyne reality Novilla is neither utopia nor dystopia; it is more like living inside one's smart phone. Once there, you are expected to clean yourself of memories and take on new names. The man and the boy are given the names Sim\u00f3n and David, respectively. Sim\u00f3n is very caring and paternal with David, but he never ceases to proclaim that the boy is \"not my grandson, not my son. We are not related \u2026 the boy happens to be in my care.\" Here we realize that the title of the novel is not misleading, for it serves to put the narrative in context. Sim\u00f3n is, like Joseph was to Jesus, a putative father. The man's sole purpose is to find the boy's \"true mother\" but he has no methodical or logical plan to find her, believing that he will know who she is once he sets eyes on her. Perhaps that was how the angel announced itself to Mary, too.And so it goes that, one day, they happen upon the gates of a wealthier gated community known as La Residencia, where they spot a thirtysomething woman playing tennis with two men. Sim\u00f3n \"recognizes\" her as David's mother. The woman is named In\u00e9s, she leaves La Residencia and moves into the gray flat where Sim\u00f3n and David are sheltered, and starts acting as the boy's overprotective mother, quickly revealing her inexperience but nonetheless remaining steadfast in her maternal mission. If this sounds absurd, let us remember again the title of the novel and recognize that the concept of the immaculate conception is no less incongruous. For his part, David swings back and forth between iconoclastic child genius and brat. The story ends as Sim\u00f3n, In\u00e9s and David flee from Novilla in the wake of a judicial order to consign the boy to a reformatory, the image of the flight to Egypt not even delicately disguised if it were not for \u2013speaking of disguises- David being dressed up in a magician's cape too large for his boyish size, and wearing sunglasses after partially having blinded himself in some sort of alchemical diversion. Although the coat is not specified as being of many colors, I could not avoid the image of the son of Jacob and Rachel, Book of Genesis, as re-hatched for modern pop culture by Andrew Lloyd-Webber in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream. After all, the Bible offers an explanation for the name Yosef: first it is compared to the word asaf from the root \"to be taken away\" and combined with the root word ysp, meaning \"to add.\" This may be a stretch of my reader's interpretation, but I have a feeling Coetzee would derive quite a chuckle from it without denying me my reading which, after all, is firmly in the context offered by the title. Sim\u00f3n, In\u00e9s and David then meet a couple of people on the road, whom they invite to join them on their journey to an unimagined new life. It hardly seems worthwhile, the effort, the journey to a new place whose only promise is \u2026 a continuation of the same. \u2026 il faut continuer, je ne peux pas, je vais continuer \u2026 so ends Samuel Beckett's L'innommable. Only in Coetzee's vision everyone gets a name.But biblical absurdities are not the only things evoked in this novel. The first of Coetzee's Australian novels, Elizabeth Costello, featured a broad correspondence between philosophers. In The Childhood of Jesus the author ups the ante, the philosophical musings and quotations are integrated into the narrative. It should be said here that, shortly after arrival at Novilla Sim\u00f3n finds work as a stevedore in the docks where, during breaks, he and his colleagues discuss the nature of life. When \u00c1lvaro, the unbelievably affable foreman, questions \" \u2026 the thing itself \u2026 do you think remains forever itself, unchanging? No. Everything flows \u2026 you cannot step twice into the same waters.\" I at once thought of Parmenides, searched in vain until Jacqueline de Romilly's La Gr\u00e8ce Antique elucidated me that it was (of course!) Heraclitus. Well \u2026 at least I was within the pre-Socratic ball park. And what are Socrates and the pres doing here? Well, Nietzsche did not like the way European philosophy had ensconced the hemlocked master at its center, so he offered Jesus as an alternative. And the plus points of these alternatives are healthily discussed in the dockside agora of our stevedores. Digressions? No, incursions into the heart of this very complex and stimulating novel. John Coetzee loves to let the reader create, make, his or her own sense out of his novels. Is Novilla a Dantesque vision of the afterlife? Is it a Socratic/Platonic utopia? Does it deliberately spoof biblical clich\u00e9s? Perhaps all of the above, perhaps none. Gertrude Stein, on her deathbed, is reputed to have asked \"What is the answer?\" When no reply came from Alice B. Toklas she said \"In that case, What is the question?\" I love novels that leave me to ruminate on its possible clues and answers. It is the author bringing in the reader to take part in his creation."}, {"userName": "Sawsan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11592808-sawsan", "userReview": "\u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0627\u0643\u0633\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0643\u0648\u062a\u0632\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u064f\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0643\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0645\u062a\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0631\u0633\u0645 \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0629 \u0648\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0629 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0641\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u064a\u0635\u0644 \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0648\u0628\u0635\u062d\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0644\u0627\u062c\u0626\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0634 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u0642\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0634\u0641 \u0643\u0648\u062a\u0632\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u0647\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0627\u0643\u0646, \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u064a\u063a\u0644\u064f\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0643\u064a\u064a\u0628\u062f\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0633\u064a\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u064f\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0643\u0644 \u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u0623\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0631\u063a\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u063a\u064a\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0635\u062f\u0642\u0627\u0624\u0647 \u0648\u0631\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0642\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u0637\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0643\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u064a\u0634\u0629\u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0645\u0648\u0636 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u062f\u064a\u0641\u064a\u062f, \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0628\u062d\u062b \u0639\u0646 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0642\u064a\u0648\u062f\u0648\u0623\u064a\u0636\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u0632\u064a \u0645\u0639 \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0639 \u0628\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639\u0627\u062a\u0647, \u064a\u0637\u0631\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0624\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629, \u0648\u064a\u0628\u062d\u062b \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u062f \u0633\u0644\u0633 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0632\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0639\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0635\u0648\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645"}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "This was my first Coetzee for several years - the last new one I read was Diary of a Bad Year, and at that time his new books seemed very gloomy and introspective. So thanks are due to the 21st Century Literature group for selecting this as one of this month's group reads.This one seems on the surface to be a simple fable. Simon has arrived in a Spanish-speaking country across the ocean and is accompanied by a small boy David who has lost his parents and his identity documents at sea. It is soon apparent that the society they have arrived in is some form of utopian community, where new arrivals are expected to forget the past, and simple lifestyles involving manual labour, limited diet and philosophical education are favoured. Simon has told David they will find his mother, and they do find a woman (Inez) willing to play the role. David is a form of idiot savant - he is resistant to conventional education and appears to be living in a fantasy world, but succeeds in teaching himself to read using a children's illustrated Don Quixote. The state wants to educate him in a special school, and Inez and Simon attempt to resist this.The setup seems to be a way to allow Coetzee to discuss his ideas of what it means to be human, and what a society can and cannot provide. Religion is curiously absent, and the relevance of Jesus seems distant and oblique.A superficially easy read, but one with plenty of hidden depths, deeper significance and ideas to ponder."}, {"userName": "Stephen P", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11602286-stephen-p", "userReview": "We have all felt that exalted state when a writer seems to write specifically for us. That is part of why I read, I am an exalted state junkie. J.M. Coetzee has been that for me. He took particular care through, Elizabeth Costello, Slow Man, Diary of a Bad Year, to carve these particular novels to my taste. Even books of his that I didn't like, I liked due to the elegance of his authorial voice. So, when, The Childhood of Jesus arrived from amazon, since my hands tend to shake a little, I asked my wife to open the box so the book's jacket would not be damaged. A successful cardboard birthing took place before my eyes. Then, the intrigue of learning the binding's etiquette of range. I opened it slowly, tensing, finding where to stop before the calamitous crack -sound. A slight riffle of the pages, then I picked up the scent of the paper, the print. This is the enclave of the spiritual, as it should be.I immediately marveled at how the master set himself a novelistic task to wind himself out of that which Houdini might shrink from. This is what great authors do, set themselves a challenge from the onset. There is no queasy looking down from the heights, no timid hesitations. A man, a young boy separated from his mother, are rescued from the same damaged ship and arrive at an unnamed country. Feeling responsible for the poor boy the man begins a long quest to find the boy's mother. Finding work at the docks we quickly see the title's sophomoric set-up of Jesus and the apostles, as well as other references, and can quickly jump past this intentional quirk to the meat of the narrative. I found but two problems: there was no meat nor any significant narrative. Coetzee made it clear early on the impossibility of finding the mother under these chaotic and harrowing circumstances. He gave no warning of the implausibility which he planned to reckon on me, who already unwittingly slightly, somewhat, cracked the binding, of the finding of a substitute mother for the boy as well as most events about to be plummeted onto the page.Being a Coetzee co-dependent I reshuffled the deck of cards and proclaimed his intent as a poking of fun at the typical narrative stratagems like building an internal structure so when an event occurs its plausibility is unquestioned, unnoticed, and the story flows to its further tributaries, we readers riding the crest of the unfurling wave. Returning to my Coetzee co-dependent support group I left the meeting-I was the only attendee-saying, NO. The foundation of the story was not set, the bones left bare. I f you really want to know what I am trying to describe go to; Nathan N.R. Gaddis's review of Baktin's, The Dialogic Imagination, and scroll down to the section; Things That Look Like Novels. Our own N.R. takes dense and difficult material planing it down to its essence. If only Coetzee read this first.What to make of this? There was for me no magic of his authorial voice, no meaning eventually rising from the prose, the polished language, to overcome plot difficulties. Was this a mis-step, uncalibrated? Is it the ending throes of the material which spurred his style and left me nestled within the brilliance of his mind? I vote for a mis-step. I hope that is all that happened."}, {"userName": "Roland", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1850691-roland", "userReview": "He sits down to create another world. He takes the real world and strips it of all the things that are not required just as he has stripped language of all that is not required, just as he has stripped narrative technique down to third-person I-narrators, even in his own diaries.We are left with the bones of narrative, the bones of language, the bones of a world. The reduction is clever. For instance, to reduce language even further, we must know that all the characters conduct their (partly highly philosophical) conversations in Spanish and that Spanish is not their first language, but the lingua franca this new state at which they have arrived forces on them. And this world in which people are assigned new Spanish names and asked to forget their past (which they all seem to achieve easily - is there supernatural help in this?), this world where stevedores are philosophers and everybody is just about helpful, but no more, is not enough for David, the Jesus of the title (\"Yo soy la verdad.\", p. 225). He wants to find a new world, eventually they travel to Estrellita del Norte and in true Jesus-manner, David invites all and sundry to abandon their lives and come join him.One is greatly looking forward to the scholars who will name the analogies - is Mr Daga Satan, tempting Jesus with his toy and wild ways? Who do In\u00e9s' brothers stand for? Why does In\u00e9s receive David through Sim\u00f3n, as it were? That is not how we read it in the bible - and it would have been easy to make her conceive without knowledge of the father, surely? And Bol\u00edvar the dog? How does he fit into the picture?The novel leaves many issues unanswered - in the best possible way.

There was milk chocolate on the outside and then, when the egg was opened, there was an extra something inside, a small packet of Maltesers, Chocolate Buttons or, for the really lucky, Smarties. (Of course, note well that the Easter egg was also an allusion to the story of Christ.) What Coetzee has given us here is a hollow egg \u2013 and one that is, like this introduction, candy-coated with a thick layer of contrived and unsubtle symbolism and allusion. The book is set in an unnamed society, where immigrants arrive with all memory of their past wiped clean and with new names given to them by the authorities. So we start with the arrival of Simon and the child of an unknown father, David (yes, David. Jesus only puts in an appearance through our friend Allusion). The society is a simple one where money is plentiful but food is in short supply. In fact, for the first couple of weeks, Simon and David are forced to live by bread alone \u2013 a thing Simon really feels man cannot do. However, the people of this new society are full of goodwill towards each other and happy with their lot \u2013 along with the cricket-bat-over-the-head Christian symbolism, Coetzee\u2019s society seems to draw heavily from Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, with Simon playing a very civilised and philosophical John the Savage.Simon has taken responsibility for finding David\u2019s mother in this new world \u2013 a task that seems impossible since not only do they not know her name or what she looks like, they also don\u2019t know David\u2019s real name (symbolic, eh?). Nothing daunted, Simon decides that a woman he has just met is David\u2019s real mother and persuades her to accept him as her son. She is, of course, a virgin. David, we are told repeatedly, is an exceptional child though in what way is unclear \u2013 those who love him accept his exceptionalism without question, one might say on faith, while the authorities soon come to believe he is disruptive and must be contained.The real problem with the book is that the symbolism is crashingly unsubtle, crammed into every nook and cranny, and yet ultimately signifies nothing. By half way through I was actually beginning to count the references \u2013 bread, tick; fishes, tick; wine, tick; virgin mother, tick; raising from the dead, tick; resurrection after 3 days, tick. At one point, as David watches Mickey Mouse on TV, Mickey\u2019s dog is referred to as Plato. By that stage, I no longer knew whether this was typo, error or mysterious allusion, but sadly I suspect the latter. There is also a real feeling of misogyny throughout the book, with the women being treated as not much more than walking wombs or repositories for Simon\u2019s (largely unfulfilled) sexual urges; though since I haven\u2019t read anything else by Coetzee, I couldn\u2019t decide if this reflected the author\u2019s own outlook, or whether it was again symbolic, perhaps of the male domination of the early Christian story.Despite all of the above, Coetzee\u2019s sparse writing style and use of language make the book a strangely compelling read and Simon in particular is an interesting character, if a little too caricatured as The Thinker. The possibility exists throughout that the book might turn into something wonderful, that the author might pull the mass of symbolism into something profound and meaningful in the end. But once the smooth and velvety chocolate of the prose has been savoured, there\u2019s nothing inside and the hollowness of the egg left this reader feeling unsatisfied and somewhat cheated."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2317433-katherine", "userReview": "The best kind of parable is one that can convey its meaning through its simplest reading while harbouring depths into which the reader can dive deeper and deeper without ever reaching a hard and fast 'moral' at the bottom. For me, what makes 'The Childhood of Jesus' seem such a feat is the great complexity of thought it provokes through the telling of a relatively straight forward (but very moving) story, exploring ideas of morality without preaching or passing judgement.The novel follows a boy, David, and his guardian, Sim\u00f3n's efforts to build a new life for themselves after seeking refuge in a country that is not their own. They have brought nothing with them from where they have come from, not even their names, and they know nothing of the customs and workings of their strange new home. While Sim\u00f3n and David's story resonates with the current political climate its also quite timeless, as Coetzee's allusion to the story of Jesus suggests. Along with a lack of chronological markers, although specified as Spanish speaking, the country that takes them is left geographically ambiguous and able to stand in for almost anywhere. Despite this abstraction, the characters and the setting remain vivid and engaging. The prose too was, unsurprisingly from the Nobel Laureate, starkly brilliant.

Some sort of abstract allegory? A parable (or series of parables)? An anti-philosophy rant? A pro-philosophy rant? What is the nature of this book?, the book itself practically begs us to ask.What is the nature of nature, what does it mean to live in this world,_how_ do you live in this world. At times, the book seems to be a series of abstract, conceptual, philosophical conversations [1]. But there's a story, too: a strange, inexplicable story of a man (Sim\u00f3n), a woman (In\u00e9s), and a young boy (David) together \"by chance\", just trying to live and make sense of reality [2]. We, too, are trying to make sense of the world imagined in the book, and perhaps by extension our own world.The characters speak \"Spanish\" (and have Spanish names [3]), but of course it is written in English (why Spanish?). Is it an English that sounds like it could have been translated from the Spanish? No, not really. Although the dialog does tend to sound \"foreign\", in that it's not really contemporary idiomatic English. Deliberate (on the part of Coetzee) of course, as we are in foreign territory here, a foreign reality it seems (at one point the boy sings something in German but he and Sim\u00f3n call it \"English\"). The world is not familiar at all, and yet also familiar in a strange, it-could-be-this-way way (why couldn't it? why shouldn't it?). We are caught off-guard, we are disoriented, disturbed perhaps (sometimes the way things work in the book's world are eerily similar to the way they work in Belgium [4]). What's going on here? [5] Is it post-apocalyptic, is it post-ironic (or post-anything)? Maybe it's avant-ironic? or is it neither, maybe it's off to the side, parallel. [6] The title is our only guide.Who is Jesus? There is no mention of him in the book. [7] But the title invites us to see \"Jesus\" in the boy. The boy shuns violence (turns the other cheek), tries to \"save\" people from harm, is called a \"gentle King\", wants \"brothers\" (to start a Brotherhood), claims to possess magical abilities and the ability to read minds, writes at one point: \"I am the truth\" (225) So is it an attempt to imagine what the \"childhood of Jesus\" might have been like?But maybe the real clue lies in Don Quixote (the reason for the Spanish?), which the boy takes a liking to and begins to read. Sim\u00f3n tells David that the author of the book is Benengeli (no mention of Cervantes, perhaps because the \"spine is torn off\" (151)). The boy thinks that Quixote is real, and of course he is real, because literature is real, just as Benengeli is as real as Cervantes. Sim\u00f3n says that Benengeli gave the book to the world, and that \"therefore it belongs to all of us.\" (166) Also, David wants to go through the pages in a hurry because otherwise a \"hole will open\" (there is throughout the idea of holes, gaps, cracks, and (the fear of) falling). So maybe this book is necessary to fill in a hole, a literature hole, a small gap in the narrative of the world.The style is dry (duh, it's Coetzee), and the book is not long, and yet there's so much there and something somehow manages to come out of it: heart, some kind of magic, the desire to desire, the will to live and start a new life.[1] aesthetics, goodwill, work, nature, history, memory, logic, language, faith, death, life, etc.[2] Sim\u00f3n wants a philosophy that \"shakes you\", changes your life. (238)[3] Everyone has a name that's not really theirs. It's been given to them, just as they've been \"forced\" to learn Spanish.[4] *cheeky wink*[5] The book doesn't tell us, maybe because it doesn't \"suffer from memories\" (58).[6] The paintings of Neo Rauch, which I happened to see while reading the book, are almost a visual representation of the disorienting what-world-is-this? feeling that comes from the book.[7] Who is God? There is only one mention of God, at the end of the book. \"But we don't live under the eye of God\" (274)."}, {"userName": "Max Nemtsov", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL":

maxwell's books have become increasingly more enigmatic over the past decade, frustrating both critics and fans alike. whereas the early works of the south african nobel laureate are marked by post-colonial violence, the injustices of apartheid, the cascading effects of history, and defiance of institutional rule, his later efforts have trended more towards the philosophical than the overtly political. coetzee's output over the past decade, including elizabeth costello, slow man, diary of a bad year, and the quasi-autobiographical summertime (the third installment of his remarkable scenes from provincial life), while still possessed of the precision prose that is his trademark, marks a newer, less rigid style of storytelling.the childhood of jesus, coetzee's first novel in six years, centers upon a very young boy named david, whom, with sim\u00f3n, a man he meets on boat whilst emigrating from his home land, attempts to carve out a new life for himself. having been separated from his mother during the journey, david is left with sim\u00f3n as his caregiver and only resource in his adopted (and nameless) country. as sim\u00f3n sets about trying to locate the boy's mother (or a suitable surrogate), the peculiar, idiosyncratic (and gifted?) nature of young david becomes ever more apparent. the curious youngster has difficulties relating to others and is eventually forsaken by the educational establishment tasked with overseeing his intellectual development.while allusions and allegories abound, coetzee never definitively links david to the titular messiah of yore. as heavy-handedness has never been coetzee's style, the reader is left wondering whether the author has intentionally selected the title for no other reason than to draw connections where there may, in fact, not be any at all. the childhood of jesus is an engaging enough read (as is everything the australian resident has written), but feels like a minor work in comparison to his other more accomplished (and prize-winning) efforts. the story never feels hurried (or at least not until, perhaps, the final pages) and as coetzee is, of course, an exacting wordsmith, it seems unlikely that this story is mere literary exercise. the new novel is an intriguing one, with all of the moral quandaries and intelligent musings found elsewhere in his other books, but coetzee seems ever more content dealing in ambiguities and uncertainties. the childhood of jesus is a personal tale of hardship, adversity, and the often unfavorable circumstances that life doles out our way. with frequent references to don quixote, it seems fitting that the main characters saunter astray despite their enviable intentions to the contrary. since winning two bookers and the nobel, it appears that readers (and critics) unfairly anticipate each novel presuming it will be not too dissimilar from its predecessor. as such, it seems coetzee may well be having fun upending readerly expectations and critical receptions. the childhood of jesus, have no doubt, is a fine novel, yet one that may lack the import, emotional devastation, and unabashed rawness of previous works. while some may inevitably see that as a fault or shortcoming, others may well relish in coetzee's willingness to challenge not only himself and his established style, but also the reader's sensibilities and presumptions of

That he must not just look at the pictures and then guess at the story. David, ever petulant, ever adverse to any reasoning but his own, rebels against this method. What is Coetzee getting at here? If he is advising us as readers to submit to what is on his page, what part? The title? David shares affinities with Jesus, but are we to submit to David as a modern day Jesus; David a wilfull, whining, overly-cosseted, hard headed brat? That is not the picture of the Christ we are taught at Sunday School, but how must Jesus have appeared to his neighbors in the poor desert village of Nazareth. His reasoning made no more sense to the Pharisees than David's does to the local school. David's parentage is odd, chosen by an intuitive force. David is well beloved of his chosen parents and described by them in terms that echo the Gospels. David is tempted by Daga (dagger). While nearly always self-centered, David does show flashes of generosity and abhors suffering. One can go on and on with parallels. His best friend-Fidel, his dog-Bolivar, the name of the young man who joins them on their journey, Juan, his virgin mother, Ines (holy). Is it a stretch that the dissident little rebel is fed to the school teacher se\u00f1or Leon? It is quite fun to find these possible parallels. The problem is that they don't add up. Nothing remains constant in its symbology. Why?Novilla, the refugee city to which David and Simon have emigrated, is a hollow world. There is enough, but nothing more. There is goodwill but no passion. There is no irony. Simon remarks this several times. The good people of Novilla are flatly honest and good. Simon needs more. David simply doesn't fit at all in this world. What is it? The afterlife, an afterlife, the circle of hell that one ends up following the path paved with good intentions? A Utopia? An Untopia? Simon keeps expecting irony, but finds none. He also looks for spices, and meat. In a world where the music is actually called Anodine, Simon is out of luck.  A world without irony, passion, spice, and meat isn't worth living in no matter how peaceful and well- intentioned the residents. When Simon tells a school official that there are things above the law, be responds, the law is \"enough\" for her. Sounds like a Pharisee to me.

It\u2019s the story of a young boy who is traveling to a new land on a ship who gets separated from his mother \u2013 who was apparently traveling separately. He had a note on where and how to find her, but the note got lost during the voyage. He was taken under the wing of an older man who was also traveling on the same boat.

When they land in this new country, where the language is Spanish \u2013 a language they don\u2019t know \u2013 they are given new names. The boy becomes David and his protector becomes Simon. They learn to adapt to the new language and new ways of living. Simon finds work at the docks while David is looked after by a woman who teaches music and has a young son about David\u2019s age. They meet a woman who lives with her two brothers in an exclusive residence. Simon recognizes her as David\u2019s mother. How or why he does so is not explained, and, in fact, she is very likely not his mother. She accepts David as her son, and Simon assumes the role of uncle or godfather. We soon find out that David is not a normal child. He is either a savant or mentally unstable. He acts as if he has dyslexia, but can read perfectly well. He knows the numbers, but cannot say them in order. His problem is that he is totally focused on the spaces between letters and numbers. All of this goes on to an unexceptional ending \u2013 leaving me totally confused about what it was I just read. Be prepared to provide your own interpretation for this novel.

Fascinating because it is set in a nameless country that is half Paradise, half Saramagian bureaucracy, a land at once eerily familiar and governed by a bland illogic all its own; because it is a novel shot through with ideas, with endless variations on the essential duality of human existence, the contrast between the objective and the subjective, between knowledge and belief, between the physical and the spiritual; and because in its closing chapters it offers an utterly delightful vision of Christ as an insecure, petulant and hyper-imaginative child.Frustrating because all these shimmering pieces never quite come together into a coherent whole; because it is hard to shake the feeling that the book is hastily and somewhat clumsily assembled; and because the characters in it seem too little like living, breathing people, and too much like abstract pawns in a chess game of meanings. If this were a first book by a writer just starting out (and possibly one translated from another language) I would have considered it a promising debut, and looked forward to the author's more mature work; coming from as accomplished a master as Coetzee it can't help but strike me as a little disappointing."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6565711-jenny", "userReview": "Coetzee is a writer I will always come back to, every turn he took in his writing so far: I will gladly follow.

To my surprize it won the voting and I agreed to moderate the group read. This caused me to read it in advance so I could be prepared for the group read. The story takes place, for the most part, in a sort of utopian socialist town in Spain. David and Simon are refugees who escaped on a boat from some unnamed place. While on the boat, David lost the letter that was attached to a cord around his neck and seemingly contained the information about where he was to go to find his mother or his parents. Simon steps in to take care of David and find his mother. Simon is assigned a room for the two of them and quickly finds a job as a stevadore. Food is cheap but not very appetizing -- bread and fruit for the most part. Buses are free.One day while exploring the countryside David and Simon see a woman playing tennis with two men. Simon is positive she should be David's mother and convinces her that she should be David's mother. Inez doesn't seem like a very good choice, but Simon is insistent. Others tell Simon he is nuts to have given David (and the apartment) to Inez. Simon just tells them his gut said she was the one. While at first Inez keeps David a way from Simon, she encounters problems that brings him back into David's life. David starts school but causes problems for the teacher. Simon tries to reason with him, but David seems pretty spoiled and unattached to reality. Eventually, Simon, Inez, and David have to leave to avoid David being taken back to a sort of reform school.

Coetzee, the first two-time winner of the Booker Prize and a literature Nobel laureate, is getting odder and more obscure. Reading his latest novel The Childhood of Jesus, I felt like being led by a highly acclaimed tour guide into a dark forest, and we were both lost.Literary critics dare not to be too harsh, because it's Coetzee we are talking about. Many of them did say the plot was mysterious and it wasn't clear how the child David was an allegory of Jesus. One of them even conceded she didn't know if Coetzee meant for us to take his philosophical discussions seriously. If the text appears undecodable, it's probably OUR fault, not his. I am not a professional critic and I haven't read ALL of Coetzee's work, so I have no baggage here. But I would say, The Childhood of Jesus is Coetzee's another experiment (but with what?) and he could have done better. If the title doesn't have the word Jesus, none of us would have imagined David was supposed to be Jesus. But a child who believed he could breathe life into a dead horse doesn't make him divine, neither when he wrote \"I'm the truth\" in a class assignment made him the son of God. Those could be argued similarities between David and Jesus, but the connection here is very weak, if not arbitrary. Also there were quite a few \"detours\" through the book, some of which have disrupted the rhythm of reading: frequent mentioning of Don Quixote, lengthy discussion on phenomenology (on thing-in-itself and their representation) by the quayside, the coming of senor Daga and the part of \"the pooness of poo\" and the vivid description of faeces on Simon's arm while he unclogged the toilet. The \"insubordination\" of David is too long, and thus annoying. Maybe I am not a big fan of children in general, but he kept arguing with no sense. He maintained that two plus two doesn't equal four, because that would be a socially agreed answer. Philosophically that's acceptable, but repeating that several times really pushed my button. Maybe Coetzee wanted to annoy us this way, to make us \"feel\" for him how it is like to be \"forced to be saved by Jesus\"? But demanding readers to play the role of the Pharisee is a bit too much. It appears to me the primary aim of this book is to deliver Coetzee's philosophy, and the characters and the plot are just secondary. Having said that, one can still easily recognize it's Coeztee's work. He hates institutions -- governments, schools, religions -- they represent unfairness and suppression. He hails personal freedom and choices. When David or his godfather Simon wanted to do \"something good\" for their comrades, such as suggesting the stevedores to use crane so that they can turn their \"bestial labor\" into some other \"higher level\" works, Coetzee told you many people were actually happy with their bestial labour and didn't want to be \"saved.\" The community here compares this work with Saramago's The Gospel According to Jesus Christ.

Instead, it's a modern story of a boy who can't fit in because he thinks in different ways than everyone around him.

What if I fall?\u2014 that is what he asks himself. What if I fall and then keep falling for ever? Lying in bed in the middle of the night, I could sometimes swear that I too was falling \u2014 falling under the same spell that grips the boy. If getting from one to two is so hard, I asked myself, how shall I ever get from zero to one? From nowhere to somewhere: it seemed to demand a miracle each time.The first thing you need to know about The Childhood of Jesus is that it contains no character named \u201cJesus\u201d: there may be loaves and fishes, a wish for the dead to rise again, and a virgin mother, but without a Jesus, you can assume it's all one big allegory, and if like me you don't get the allusions, it's a head-scratcher of a book that doesn't satisfy on its own straightforward reading. The other thing you need to know is that J. M. Coetzee is probably a literary genius, and as such, he likely doesn't care a bit if I, an average reader, can follow along. The book opens as a man and a young boy arrive in a strange land as refugees and seek shelter and information at the Centro de Reubicaci\u00f3n Novilla. We learn the man's name is Sim\u00f3n, and on their ocean crossing, he assumed responsibility for the boy, David, when the youngster became separated from his mother. Repeatedly, Sim\u00f3n must stress, \u201cNot my grandson, not my son, but I am responsible for him.\u201d (And does this have something to do with Simon Peter's denial of Jesus after his arrest? The title urges the reader to look for such biblical connections throughout.) In this new country, everyone has been brought from away, somehow had their memories erased, have been assigned new names and presumed ages, and all are compelled to speak to one another in beginner's Spanish. At every turn, Sim\u00f3n is surprised at how helpful everyone is, yet also shocked by how dispassionate they are: helpfulness is based on a common sense of \u201cgoodwill\u201d, but there is so little actual empathy that Sim\u00f3n and David are forced to sleep in the yard of an employee from the Centre on their first night, given nothing but bread and water for their dinner, encouraged to attend to their bathroom needs in the bushes. The town of Novilla seems to be some kind of Socialist Utopia (and a Spanish one at that, with a little boy named Fidel and a dog named Bolivar), where Sim\u00f3n and the boy are assigned basic accommodations in an apartment block, money is easy to come by but there is very little to buy, and Sim\u00f3n easily finds employment as a stevedore at the docks \u2013 a physically demanding job for which he is unsuited, but the goodwill of his fellow employees is such that no one minds if he can't shoulder as many sacks as everyone else: the goal is to work for its own sake and take pride in receiving a pay packet at the end of the week. Unlike those around him who seem to accept the culture of this strange land, Sim\u00f3n senses that things are missing:\nIt is true: I have no memories. But images still persist, shades of images. How that is I can't explain. Something deeper persists too, which I call the memory of having a memory.\nSim\u00f3n doesn't understand why everyone is content with bread and water (Man cannot live by bread alone), or why he's the only one who seems to suffer from sexual desire, or why no one eats meat or uses spices or questions the point of a gang of men emptying the holds of ships, day after back-breaking day, when a crane would be more efficient. Sim\u00f3n attempts to engage his coworkers in a philosophical discussion about the nature of work, that history itself demands the evolution from manual labour to mechanised, saying:\nLike you I crossed the ocean. Like you I bring no history with me. What history I had I left behind. I am simply a new man in a new land, and that is a good thing. But I have not let go of the idea of history, the idea of change without beginning or end. Ideas can not be washed out of us, not even by time. Ideas are everywhere. The universe is instinct with them. Without them there would be no universe, for there would be no being.\nObviously, Sim\u00f3n believes that he is challenging the others' thinking, but at this speech, the foreman invokes \u201cThe spirit of the angora\u201d, asking if someone has a response to this. A younger man steps forward and speaks eloquently on the nature of reality, concluding, \u201c'Which of us has ever had his cap blown off by history?' There is silence. 'No one. Because history has no manifestations. Because history is not real. Because history is just a made up story...History is merely a pattern we see in what has passed. It has no power to reach into the present.'\u201d (It is revealed later that there is an Institute in Novilla where the citizens can take free courses and this young man studies Philosophy \u2013 yet when Sim\u00f3n attends a seminar he leaves in disgust because the lecture is on the chairness of chairs and the tableness of tables.)Meanwhile, Sim\u00f3n believes that his purpose in Novilla is to reunite David with his mother (although neither of them would recognise her, neither even knows her name), and based on his feeling that he would simply know her to see her, Sim\u00f3n offers the boy to the first woman, In\u00e9s, that feels right. Sim\u00f3n installs In\u00e9s in his own apartment with the boy (where she infantalises the five year old by powdering his bum, installing a crib, and pushing him around in a stroller), and Sim\u00f3n takes on the role of godfather, trying to teach the boy to read from a child's abridged version of Don Quixote. (And here is an academic essay on Coetzee's use of Cervantes throughout his writing, and especially as it relates to Borges; which, with the Spanish Socialist Republic seen here, seems particularly relevant.) Because David seems confused about whether or not Don Quixote is actually battling giants or tilting at windmills, Sim\u00f3n explains that it can be read either way; from either Quixote's fantastical or Sancho's literal perspective (which seems a clue to reading this book?). But when David tries to make up his own stories based on the pictures instead of actually learning to read, Sim\u00f3n proclaims, \u201cFor real reading you have to submit to what is written on the page. You have to give up your own fantasies. You have to stop being silly. You have to stop being a baby.\u201d (Which seems a clue to reading this book?)When David turns six, they are forced to send him to school, but his refusal to learn to read and his \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d with numbers tags the boy as a problematic student who would do better at a reform school. When Sim\u00f3n discovers that David can indeed read and brings him back to the school to show his teacher, the teacher is annoyed to have been tricked. When commanded by his teacher to write out the phrase, \u201cConviene que yo diga la verdad, I must tell the truth\u201d, David instead writes, \u201cYo soy la verdad, I am the truth.\u201d And this is why the teacher finds the boy unteachable: David has spent his schooldays being mysterious and defiant. In order to avoid sending David to reform school, Sim\u00f3n and In\u00e9s escape with the boy from Novilla (a flight into Egypt perhaps?), and as they drive along, David encourages everyone they meet to join them in their new life; gathering disciples, as it were. The end.In reading other reviews for  The Childhood of Jesus, I see people mentioning all the great philosophers (from Plato to Dante to Voltaire) that are invoked by this book, and I suppose I would have gotten more from it if I recognised the references. I believe I got most of the Biblical allusions, but that only serves to highlight how weird this book reads as an interpretation of \u201cthe childhood of Jesus\u201d: the spoiled and bratty David hardly seems like the Christchild, meek and mild. I picked this book up because the 2016 Man Booker Prize longlist was released this week and Coetzee's The Schooldays of Jesus has been nominated \u2013 as that book is the sequel to this one, I hope to at least have gained some scant basis for understanding it (when it is finally released in October). This book went over my head, and while I wish I could give it four or five stars and rave above what a genius literary work it is, that would be a lie: to my undereducated and unitiated sensibilities, it was just all right."}, {"userName": "Xenja", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70047683-xenja", "userReview": "Una piccola citt\u00e0 portuale, Novilla, di un paese senza nome, accoglie innumerevoli profughi che hanno attraversato l'oceano per cominciare una nuova vita.

Binnen het universum van J.M. Coetzee studeren stuwadoors filosofie en vragen ze zich tussen sjouwen en houwen door of zoiets mogelijk dan wel wenselijk is.

Het verhaal gaat over een anonieme vluchteling (laten we hem Simon noemen) die op zoek gaat naar een (de?) moeder voor \u201ceen interessant kind\u201d waar hij zich tijdens zijn tocht over ontfermd heeft (laten we het kind David noemen). Hun verhaal biedt tal van aanknopingspunten met onze wereld \u2013 sommige subtiel, sommige minder \u2013 maar het plaatje klopt nooit helemaal.Coetzee dompelt je onder in een parallel universum. De gesuggereerde wereld is herkenbaar, maar ook erg bevreemdend. Geschiedenis en actualiteit lijken vervaagd, de details gewist tot enkel het idee overblijft.

Stel dat we het mis hebben? Stel dat er tussen een en twee helemaal geen brug is en alleen maar lege ruimte?Zo gaat Coetzee binnen een bedrieglijk eenvoudig verhaaltje vlijmscherp naar de kern van de literatuur. In mooi proza bouwt hij zijn eigen nieuwe wereld, met duidelijke echo\u2019s van onze wereld, maar toch helemaal anders. Met mooie en heldere taal cre\u00ebert hij een eigen wereld.

Geeft de literatuur ons een knuffel of krijgen we klappen van de werkelijkheid?Ik ben benieuwd hoe dit verder gaat\u2026---PS: Tegen mijn gewoonte in heb ik dit Engelstalige boek niet in het origineel gelezen, ter bevestiging van de uitzonderingsstatus van de schrijver in kwestie, en ook omdat de Nederlandse vertalingen van Coetzee verdomd mooi uitgegeven zijn."}, {"userName": "Shashi Martynova", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2413885-shashi-martynova", "userReview": "Very shrewd and deft thing, this novel, with sharp-pointed voice and poker face. There's a sense, that the author made the universe with much much more to weave into it (meaning not \"saying more\", but in much more intricate detail), though I can't appreciate enough the crystal lucidity of the style chosen, and with this style it's very easy to stray into enthalled dive of minutae of this queer and sometimes eerie utopia.And yes, author's tongue-in-cheek is nothing but charming."}, {"userName": "  LunaBel ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6044687-lunabel", "userReview": "THe Childhood of Jesus \u00a0Simon and David come to Novilla by boat in order to start a new life and speak Spanish. Simon is a man in his forties, he does not know exactly his age, and David is a child Simon meets in the boat. Even though Simon does not know David he decides to help him survive and find his mother. David had\u00a0 a letter which explains who he is and who his mother is, but he loses it in the boat, as it seems that in the boat, all the memories are lost.\u00a0Simon stays true to his promise. He takes care of the child until he finds his mother. Since the authorities do not help to identify his mother, and how could they? Since there is no information about the child and even his name is one given to him when he arrived to Novilla. Simon reassures the child; he will be able to recognize his mother the second he sees her. And this is how he has found David\u2019s mother, and this is when real problems started\u2026\u00a0At first I didn\u2019t really understand why Coetzee has chosen \u201cthe Childhood of Jesus,\u201d but few pages in the book, it has become clear that he is referring to a modern \u2018jesus\u2019: a child who blesses the life of Ines, the virgin whom Simon chooses as David\u2019s mother. The second Simon sees Ines he decides that she is David\u2019s mother and they have to be reunited. She does not accept it at first, but she quickly changes her mind. Any woman wants a child for herself, she declares at the end of the book.\u00a0Novilla, for \u2018nouvelle vie,\u2019 or \u2018novel life\u2019 is a an utopian city of some sort. Everyone has goodwill for David and Simon. Simon soon finds a job and an apartment where his settles. Everyone is nice to them. It\u2019s like if everyone who comes to that place is reprogrammed to become nicer. The citizens do not remember their past, their memories, and previous lives. They have goodwill but they cannot feel strong emotions. In this regard, Simon feels to be abnormal as he wants to feel strongly for a woman, be able to hold her and make love to her. But this he cant find, even when his neighbor Elena agrees to become his partner (for when he needs one); she is distant and feels no pleasure.\u201cFrom goodwill come friendship and happiness, come companionable picnics in the parklands or companionable afternoons strolling in the forest. Whereas from love, or at least from longing in its more urgent manifestations, come frustration and doubt and heartsore. It is as simple as that.\"\u00a0Even though people do not hurt others, they still do not help that much. They obey the rules and would not do much when it comes to things that is not assigned to them, with exceptions of course. Individuals also do not question the authority of David\u2019s \u2018father,\u2019 uncle\u2019, \u2018godfather\u2019. Each time someone asks if Simon is david\u2019s father the latter answers \u2018no\u2019 but no one wonders or care to know why a stranger is taking care of a child.Elena accuses Simon of acting on intuition alone. He does not know what he is doing. For her, he lives in a delusion (and for him she lives in a dead world) of knowing things he does not control. He cannot just pick the first virgin he meets and give her a responsibility she cannot know how to deal with. But in this world, these sort of things are possible.Luckily for David, Simon is a good man, and after he hands David over to Ines, he tries to stay away from the mother and the son, as they need time to get used to each other. However, Ines becomes too protective and refuses to let David go to school, and since no one can resist the law, Ines, David and Simon have to leave like fugitives.I really liked this book. It is at the same time funny, simple, serious, and ironic. The end was not what I expected but I think that there couldn\u2019t be a better end for it.\u00a0\"In the world we live in there are random numbers and random names and random events, like being picked up at random by a car containing a man and a woman and a child named David. \u201c"}], "description": "After crossing oceans, a man and a boy arrive in a new land. Here they are each assigned a name and an age, and held in a camp in the desert while they learn Spanish, the language of their new country. As Sim\u00f3n and David they make their way to the relocation centre in the city of Novilla, where officialdom treats them politely but not necessarily helpfully.Sim\u00f3n finds a job in a grain wharf. The work is unfamiliar and backbreaking, but he soon warms to his stevedore comrades, who during breaks conduct philosophical dialogues on the dignity of labour, and generally take him to their hearts.Now he must set about his task of locating the boy\u2019s mother. Though like everyone else who arrives in this new country he seems to be washed clean of all traces of memory, he is convinced he will know her when he sees her. And indeed, while walking with the boy in the countryside Sim\u00f3n catches sight of a woman he is certain is the mother, and persuades her to assume the role.David's new mother comes to realise that he is an exceptional child, a bright, dreamy boy with highly unusual ideas about the world. But the school authorities detect a rebellious streak in him and insist he be sent to a special school far away. His mother refuses to yield him up, and it is Sim\u00f3n who must drive the car as the trio flees across the mountains.THE CHILDHOOD OF JESUS is a profound, beautiful and continually surprising novel from a very great writer.", "title": "The Childhood of Jesus", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799416-the-childhood-of-jesus", "average": 3.39, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353033238l/15799416.jpg", "reviews": 676, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4128.J_M_Coetzee", "name": "J.M.
