When I first started reading this book, I was a little confused picking out the exact difference between the 3 groups of humans that the whole story evolves around. But the author, Oren Hammerquist, did a great job in breaking it down for the reader. One group of humans have a brain chip, surgically implanted, which is linked to a super computer that does all their thinking for them. The other two groups of humans, are without brain implants. One group raids and plunders to obtain any basic essentials they might require, while the last group lives in relative poverty to just survive. Each group considers the other one an enemy and each group lives within their own seperate and protected community. When the super computer,linked to each brain chip, breaks down, the people who have the implants lose all connection to reality and become dependent on the most basic of human instincts to survive. The book takes you into each of the three groups fears and beliefs and shows you how survival can bring enemies together, when there's no other alternative. Even how rivals can work together, for a common goal, and eventually become friends. \"Savage Animals\" is great read and one I would highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30688887-elena", "userReview": "I was lucky to win this book through first readers on Goodreads ...

It was a great book. I love dystopias and this was a great one."}], "description": "In a post-dystopian world, mankind is about to lose the peace it has finally found. \"Civilized man\" lives once again in walled cities to protect themselves from those that refuse to the brain implants. One third of humanity shares a single base of knowledge though computer chips in their brain. One third supports the modern man. One third steals from the rest.It is a system that keeps peace by avoiding conflict. When the computer linking the most civilized humans in history breaks, those humans are put at the mercy of their most animal instincts. The computer must override the higher brain functions of its humans to survive; the humans know only that they must somehow survive.Those that die in this second apocalypse will be the lucky ones. Those that survive will one day awaken with the knowledge of what they are, and always will be, at heart: Savage Animals.", "title": "Savage Animals", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25416099-savage-animals", "average": 5.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1429832857l/25416099.jpg", "reviews": 3, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7254413.Oren_Hammerquist", "name": "Oren Hammerquist"}], "type": ["Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25416099-savage-animals", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20805132-murphy-s-second-death", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39304514-hindsights", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22301592-love-transcends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22301582-the-man-with-three-names-and-other-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23477501-motherlode"]}
