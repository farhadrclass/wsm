This is one of those times. I may not have come across this novel but a friend had just finished reading it and loved it. She thought I might enjoy it too.She was right. I loved it!Margaret Jacobsen has worked hard all of her life and things are starting to pay off. She\u2019s dating an awesome guy, she\u2019s going to be starting a great new job, and on a night out with her boyfriend, Chip, she has a strong feeling that things are about to get even better.We\u2019ve all heard that saying that life can change in a moment, or the blink of an eye. And for Margaret, nothing could be truer when the greatest day of her life quickly turns into the worst day of her life. Her life is forever changed.\n \u201cThey say your life flashes before your eyes, but it wasn\u2019t my life as I\u2019d lived it that I saw. It was the life I\u2019d been waiting for. The one I\u2019d never get a chance to live.\u201d\n\u201cHow to Walk Away\u201d really was a fantastic read populated with so many awesome characters. Some good guys\u2026some villains\u2026but all well-developed and entertaining! Margaret is such a great character. Her personality won me over instantly. Her habit of filling the quiet with very strange but hilarious comments was just one of the things I loved about her.Heart-breaking one moment and laugh out loud funny the next (\n\u201cMes jambons sont eclat\u00e9s\u201d ). \nThis was an incredibly inspiring read that made me look at a few things in my own life in a different way.Katherine Center writes with honesty and includes all of the messy parts. For me this was more than just a good story\u2026.it was fantastic! Strained relationships and family secrets, many things were easy to relate to. A story about strength, determination, love and so much more. The plot held my interest from start to finish and the characters captured my heart. I may have been able to see where things were going but the journey was just so much fun. Witty, loving, and optimistic, I started reading slower because I didn\u2019t want it to end.\n \u201cCarry the sorrow when we have to, and absolutely savor the joy when we can\u201d \nI\u2019m looking forward to reading whatever comes next from Katherine Center. She has written five other novels about love and family. You can bet I\u2019ll be checking out those books out too.I'd like to thank St. Martin\u2019s Press for giving me the opportunity to read this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9684061-melissa", "userReview": "*2.5 stars*Quotes alluding to a charming, witty and heartbreaking read from some of the heavy-hitters in the women\u2019s fiction genre made picking up How to Walk Away a no-brainer for this reader. Finding the strength and tenacity to overcome a tragedy, along with a budding romance . . . how could this bleeding heart not love this book? Believe me, I tried. I really did. The approach Katherine Center takes in telling Margaret\u2019s story of perseverance is what I feel differentiates this book from so many others, but it also makes it sort of contradictory in tone. Margaret is a twenty-something on the brink of having everything she ever wanted and through no fault of her own, loses it all in one fell swoop. It\u2019s quite devastating actually. Yet, the author opts for a fluff-fest, laden with self-help lines and a saccharine tone to brighten the mood. It was a bit much, even for this optimist. I\u2019m guessing here, but I think the overly-positive approach to the topic driving this plot will divide readers. There will be those that undoubtedly appreciate the lightness the author brings to such heavy subject matter and there will be others\u2014like myself\u2014that struggle to connect emotionally and yearn for something deeper, more meaningful and authentic.Piecing together what happens after the major plot point is revealed is pretty simple, so I\u2019m not going to dissect things here, but I will say Margaret\u2019s new reality lacked some credibility. Not only were there inconsistencies surrounding her condition that seemed to take shape depending on the situation she found herself in, but the absence of any questioning on her part\u2014especially in the beginning\u2014felt off. It\u2019s not a far stretch to think anyone in her situation would demand answers, immediately. What I found to be even more inauthentic was the dialogue, behavior and non-stop drama brought on by the secondary characters. They were not an easy bunch for me to like or even understand. The author relied heavily on their exaggerated antics to carry the story forward, which only served to highlight how weak the heart of the plot truly was. Compounded by the predictability, the author\u2019s ease in glossing over pivotal points, the number of coincidences and that ending . . . do I even have to say it? How to Walk Away has not landed among my favorites.*Thank you to St. Martin\u2019s Press for providing me with a review copy."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "4.5 stars for this one.When you can accurately predict nearly the entire plot of a book, yet you still can't tear yourself away from it\u2014that's when you know you've found a good one.Margaret Jacobsen has always been an overachiever. She worked tirelessly to get good grades and succeed in school. She has been dating her handsome, steadfast boyfriend, Chip, for several years now, and she just landed her dream job, even though she wasn't quite qualified. Everything is leading her up to the moment she's been waiting for\u2014she knows Chip is going to propose and they'll begin their journey to happily ever after.Yet how often does everything turn out just as you've planned it? In a split second, perhaps the most magical moment in her life to date turns into her biggest nightmare, and she's powerless to stop it. The next thing she knows, she wakes up in the hospital, having to face obstacles like she'd never imagined.\"We were the very definition of helpless, and as I realized that, it also hit me that everything I'd been looking forward to was over before it even began. Chip and me\u2014and the lakeside wedding we'd never have, and the rescue beagle we'd never adopt, and the valedictorian babies we'd never make. They say your life flashes before your eyes, but it wasn't my life as I'd lived it that I saw. It was the life I'd been waiting for. The one I'd never get a chance to live.\"Suddenly, the woman for whom everything has worked out perfectly has her whole life turned upside down. Yet at the very moment when all she wants to do is wallow, she has to deal with those around her as well. Chip is drowning in self-pity and wants Margaret to forgive him and give him the easy way out, without an ounce of sacrifice on his part. Her mother has taken on this challenge as she's taken on every other obstacle in life\u2014full steam ahead\u2014and will stop at nothing to make her daughter fight to get every ounce of her life back and believe that is possible. Margaret's sister Kit returns after a three-year absence, and tries to help her with her quirky sense of humor and her unflagging sense of enthusiasm.And then there's Ian, Margaret's physical therapist. The one the hospital staff thinks is too mean for Margaret's wounded psyche. The only PT who doesn't encourage or laugh with his patients, but instead just pushes them harder. The one who seems as if he feels nothing for anyone, except rage for his boss and the situation he's found himself in.Margaret wants some semblance of her life back, but doesn't know what that entails, and she doesn't know how to handle those who purportedly know better than she does. How can she look forward to a life that will never be the same, never be what she had dreamed of? Will she even be able to have the things that \"normal\" people want\u2014love, a family, a job, a future?\"I kept things calm, I stayed pleasant, I took my medicine\u2014but the truth is, I had woken up in a dystopic world, one so different that even all the colors were in a minor key, more like a sour, washed-out old photograph than anything real. It looked that way, and it felt that way, too.\"From the very first pages, \nHow to Walk Away\n drew me in. As soon as I figured out what was happening, I knew where the plot would go, and while at first I was a little frustrated, this book won me over almost immediately. These characters seem familiar yet they are so appealing, even when they're acting selfishly, headstrong, impetuous, or insensitive. It didn't matter that I knew what would happen from start to finish\u2014I cared about these characters and needed to be part of their story.This is a book about finding hope and courage where you think you have none, about how you need to be the person to motivate yourself and buoy yourself through tough times\u2014you can't depend on those around you. It's also the story of how it's always great to have family and supporters and loved ones around, but you have to learn to do things for yourself, too.I'm being a little evasive with the plot even though many reviews explain just what happened to Margaret. I thought it was better to let the story unfold for you, even though you might very well predict it, too. This is tremendously appealing and so winning, that even when you wonder just how likely it would be that certain things would happen, you tell yourself to stop overanalyzing and keep enjoying.A book that tugs at your heartstrings and makes you talk to yourself: how can you ask for anything more? I can see a lot of people really loving this one.NetGalley and St. Martin's Press provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review. Thanks for making this available!

She had earned her MBA, she was about to start a dream job, and was in a relationship with the \"perfect man\". What could be better? Then on day, Chip, the perfect man, decided to take her flying. He knew that she was scared to fly, he knew that she had reservations, but he talked her into it. Never mind that although he is taking private pilot lessons and is so very close to getting his license - he was not a licensed pilot. He took out a plane and up they flew. What was supposed to be a romantic flight where they became engaged, turned into a nightmare. During landing they crashed, and Chip walked away without any injuries while Margret was not so lucky. In the hospital, she learned just how extensive her injuries are. She also learned some family secrets, faces heartbreak, copes with her medical situation and prognosis for her future. Her sister, Kit, who has been estranged form the family for several years, comes back into her life and provides a cushion for Margaret (Maggie) as she copes with her current situation, her parents, Chip, Chip's Mother and her own feelings about her physical injuries. As she struggles with her physical therapy and her attempts to get a smile out of Ian, her physical therapist, we watch as she learns she still has a future, can still enjoy her life, and move on from past hurts.People show you who THEY are in how they treat you. During the course of her hospitalization and recovery, Margaret learns a lot about the people in her life through how they treat her and react to her injuries.A lot of research went into Margaret's medical condition, burns, prognosis and physical therapy options. I did like how she is depicted as having various emotions during her hospital stay when learning of her injuries and her prognosis: shock, fear, hope, determination, worry, acceptance etc. I found that part to be realistic and made the book more enjoyable. She didn't just initially accept things and move on, she needed support which she mainly received form her physical therapist and her sister. Yes, her parents were supportive as well, but I really enjoyed her relationship with her sister and her physical therapist.This was an enjoyable book about moving on, second chances, inner strength, family, acceptance and not giving up.Thank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Crumb", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53025065-crumb", "userReview": "Margaret thinks this is it! Today is the day that she is going to become an engaged woman. And she did! But her whole life got rocked in ways that she could never have foreseen or imagined.

Everyone needs a palate cleanser once in a while, at least in my opinion.

I found out there is a genre that is exactly this- UpLit. How to Walk Away is another rendition of UpLit. Margaret is in the prime of her life, when it all may have been taken from her in an instant as the result of a tragic accident. Waking up in the hospital, she has choices to make. Just how will she move forward after the devastation she has experienced? Will her life ever go back to normal?I admired Margaret\u2019s journey towards healing. She allowed others to help her.

We can spin out of control in a nano second and all that we have come to know is left in shambles in the whirlwind.Margaret Jacobsen knows only too well of the ridges and swirls of that thumbprint. With a freshly earned MBA and a handsome fiance in tow, Margaret reaches new heights. But those starlit heights have taken her on a flight with tragic consequences. Chip wanted the perfect setting high above the clouds when he presented Margaret with his grandmother's ring. That was not in the flight plan and neither were the serious injuries that Margaret would sustain while Chip walked away from the crash unscathed. A question for the doctor.......Katherine Center creates a storyline surrounded, at first, with the robust energy of youth and an open highway of opportunity. Her main character, Margaret, will wake in a hospital bed with a very dreary prognosis. Nurses and therapists refrain from giving Margaret any insight into her condition. They pipe up time and time again: \"Now that's a question for the doctor.\"Although we eye Margaret as our main concern, Katherine Center lines her story with interesting characters including an unpredictable sister, Kitty, that she hasn't seen in three years, and a mother who refuses to address this. Her father sits mostly on the sidelines, but his character will come to the fore when a \"family situation\" comes to the surface. Center weaves other noted characters throughout who may have a great impact on Margaret as she goes through the healing process.I was impressed with the research that Katherine Center must have done in order to address Margaret's injuries. Be aware that it's not all encased in a clinical environment. Center taps mightily into the emotional side as well giving us a fully rounded main character. There is an ease to the flow of her writing style and the humorous dialogue is edgy with the flavor of our own familiar conversations and comebacks. There's a lot of \"human\" going on in this one, folks. And that, I believe, is at the essence of the draw.I received a copy of How to Walk Away through NetGalley for an honest review.

How to Walk Away by Katherine Center made me cry even harder than The Ones We Choose did. However, in this book there is more romance and much more of an \"inspirational story\" vibe. Margaret Jacobsen is 27 years old when she gets on a Cessna prop plane with her boyfriend who is working on getting his pilot's license. She is terrified of flying, but she gets on anyway because she wants to face her fears (plus she thinks her boyfriend Chip is about to propose). This is a choice that will change her life forever.. What follows is the story of how Margaret copes with a life changing injury, and how everyone else reacts as well. This book made me cry like a BABY, and I loved what a strong personality Margaret is. If there is a real Margaret Jacobsen out there I want her to be my best friend because she was such a relatable character, and she was freaking hilarious. How to Walk Away is told entirely from Margaret's point of view, and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. It felt like your best friend was telling you her life story and it just felt so real to me. This book is all about overcoming a life-changing tragedy. It was such a perfect combination of adversity, romance, and joy that it made it a very emotional but hopeful read. I was also able to read this book in a day which is saying something too!Final Thought: I loved this book and when I got towards the end I wished there wasn't an ending. It is so beautifully written, and I really can't wait to read more from this author knowing how much I loved this novel.

Well... not really haha.How to Walk Away was my first read by Katherine Center and I can definitely see why so many readers love her books! How to Walk Away is a very uplifting and powerful story about learning to move on from things that cannot be changed. I remember going through a very tough time in my mid 20's and I bought a journal that had the following quote on each page \"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference.\" This book I think goes by this quote very very well. Margaret has the ultimate dream job and her perfect fiance in tow. Unfortunately, this all comes crashing down by a terrible accident which resulted in her fiance Chip taking Margaret flying. Margaret is ultimately paralyzed by the accident and her fiance Chip doesn't even have a scratch on him. Margaret's world as you can imagine is turned upside in a matter of seconds.The story explores Margaret's journey of growth, forgiveness, and healing. Even though the story is focused mainly on Margaret, I enjoyed the dynamics of Margaret's sister, her father, and mother that the author nicely weaves into the plot.

How to Walk Away is about a contemporary Texan family that is brought together after a devastating plane crash leaves one of their daughters(Margaret)in critical condition and prompts the return of their prodigal daughter, Kit. Margaret soon realizes that she's facing a life of paralysis which turns her \"perfect \" life upside down.  How to Walk Away is a poignant tale of how we must accept the things we cannot change and find the strength to move on. But don't fear, it isn't all doom and gloom. I found many times that there were humorous moments especially in the narrative style of Margaret's voice. Katherine Center makes her such a memorable character. At times, I wanted to throttle both her mother and fiancee for the way they behaved or what they said, but at least with the former, it was really from a place of love. As for the latter, he definitely is not in my good books. Oh and I loved Ian! Margaret's Scottish PTwas my favorite character in the book, even though we don't get to hear his p.o.v. 4 very powerful stars!"}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/\nI immediately jumped at the chance for an advanced copy of How To Walk Away when a comparison was made to Me Before You - despite knowing the potential outcome of a book that might possibly give me feelings . . . . \nI accepted the challenge.

It appears not a whole lot is being said about the plot in the blurb, so I\u2019m going to attempt to keep my mouth shut as much as possible as well. I\u2019ll simply say the story here is of Margaret, who gets engaged one minute and finds her life cartwheeling out of control the next. The remainder of the book is what happens during the year following that life-changing moment. The only thing else I can say?????\nWhile there were definitely some easy comparisons to Me Before You that delivered the same types of feelz . . . . . \nIt was the story as a whole and Margaret\u2019s family that pushed me over the edge into 5 Star territory.

Everything you had planned for, hoped for, and dreamed about is over. For Margaret, her life changes in an instant with a devastating accident that leaves her severely injured.The focus of this heartwarming novel is how Margaret copes with the hand she's been dealt. And she has a colorful cast of characters that help her do just that. Some you will loathe, some will frustrate you, and others you will fall in love with. All are interesting, but her sister Kitty stole my heart. I\u2019m paraphrasing, but the ultimate message in the book is you have to live the life you were given, look for reasons to be grateful, work to create them while finding inspiration in the struggle, and pull joy out of hardship. \u201cBecause that\u2019s all we can do: carry the sorrow when we have to and absolutely savor the joy when we can. Life is always, always both.\u201d I think the author successfully blended a happy feel-good story with the realities of life not always turning out the way we expect and she does it with humor and a lot of heart.

She has crafted a beautiful, heartbreaking, and thoroughly romantic novel that is sure to be a hit with everyone who reads it. Soon after the book opens, Margaret Jacobsen\u2019s world changes in an instant, and she must learn to forge ahead while trying to move on from the past. Margaret is tougher than she thinks and with the help of her sister and her physical therapist Ian, she slowly begins to create a new path for herself while learning to adjust to newly discovered family secrets and heartbreak. The story is clever, unpredictable, devastating, and ultimately unforgettable. Center has crafted fabulous, genuine characters that I loved and rooted for (Margaret, Kit, and Ian) and others that I wanted to throttle (Chip and his mother). And most importantly, the ending is outstanding.How to Walk Away is thought-provoking and handles a tough subject effectively and realistically, refusing to sugarcoat Margaret\u2019s predicament which I appreciated. I find it frustrating when an author includes a tough topic only to downplay or gloss over the difficulty of the situation. Moreover, Center has clearly done her research on Margaret\u2019s condition which adds depth and authenticity to the story \u2013 I learned so much that I didn\u2019t know. I think my favorite part of the book is Center\u2019s message that people do not always control what happens to them, but they do control how they handle the issues that arise, whether the issues are significant or simply a blip on the screen of life. That message certainly resonates with me and is a good reminder that while certain things cannot be changed, I can alter how I approach responding to those things.How to Walk Away is a fantastic book that I will continue thinking about for a long time. I highly recommend it, and when you sit down to read it have tissues ready. Clear your schedule before you start it, because you will not be able to put it down. I received a copy to read and review.

When I first started reading this I felt very sad for the main character, Margaret. Her situation was very depressing. But luckily the book didn\u2019t continue down that path. It got pretty uplifting about a 1/3 of the way in. I really enjoyed seeing Margaret\u2019s state of mind change throughout her recovery. It was really inspiring. Often times I stopped and thought about what I would do in her situation. I loved the love interest, Ian. I liked that he did have his faults, which made him feel real. So many times books like these have a \u201cMr. Perfect\u201d type of love interest, so I was very happy to see that Ian was different. As for the other characters, I really liked Margaret\u2019s sister, Kitty. She was such a fun character. I also really liked that the book was realistic. Like I mentioned previously, Ian felt like a realistic love interest, but besides that, the way Margaret\u2019s condition was handled felt very realistic as well. It could have gone down the \u201cmiracle\u201d route, but didn\u2019t. The author did a great job highlighting the reality of Margaret\u2019s injury and did it proper justice. The writing style was also superb. It was written in a very easy-going, conversational manner, which made it a joy to read.Overall, I really enjoyed this book.

This story lead to another interesting and fun discussion amongst us as we dug deep into the layers and meaning to this story. How to Walk Away is an inspirational heartwarming story told by our memorable main character Margaret who experiences a traumatic accident. It is Margaret's story of recovery that focuses on second chances, acceptance and family support and love. Katherine Center does a great job creating likable, interesting well-developed characters and we loved the dynamics between them and their relationships. We all really loved the dynamics between sisters Margaret and Kit and loved the humor and warmth Kit brought to the story. Most of us loved the ending and were left lost in the inspirational, sunny sweet smelling lush coulee feeling so warm and happy with this story while one sister was left standing alone with a little too much sweetness that affected her enjoyment for this story till another sister joined her.

Unfortunately life was about to hand her a basket full of lemons. Sometimes when everything seems so very sweet, things can and do turn sour in a heartbeat. For Margaret that moment has come when the sweetness of life becomes a nightmare of tragedy.Magaret Jacobsen has it all, a gorgeous fiance, a soon to be dream job, and a loving family. She is beautiful, successful, and the world as they say is her oyster .What could be better really? The one thing Margaret (Maggie) fears is flying but when her soon to be fiance decides to pop the question while taking her flying, she acquiesces and reluctantly boards the plane. Chip is a new pilot, well almost a pilot but he is confident, he knows what he is doing and he has a plan. Things seem to be going ever so well and then turn and as life often does, and this dream becomes a nightmare. Margaret finds herself in a hospital and as time progresses, she learns the extent of her injuries. It is devastating but her missing for three years sister. Kitty, arrives along with her free spirit nature, and endeavors to help Margaret cope. There is heartbreak in this journey for Maggie, a long road to recovery, a secret within the family , and a person Margaret felt was in a corner deserting her. She is helped by not only family but also the hospital staff. In rehabilitation she to assigned to a therapist, Ian, a Scottish young man who is unfriendly, evasive, and bordering on mean. However, there is something about him that makes Margaret or as he calls her Maggie look to him for guidance and help. The sparks fly between them and one of the very positive things about this novel is the dialogue, attitudes, and feelings, and wit that are displayed by Maggie, Ian, and her sister. They make quite a trio! Her mother, a take charge person, tries to lead and direct, but Maggie's sister, a definite asset in the story,, wants Maggie to take charge of her own life, no matter which way it goes. We all need a sister like Kitty in our lives! She is the spark that ignites Maggie into action and Ian is the man who makes things come together and gives Maggie a reason to push forward. Told with humor and a spirit of I can do, this story is a quick, fun read, one that surely will be a hit. My one criticism for this book which I truly did like is that the medical issues that Maggie went through seemed to be painted in a trivial manner. I know this was suppose to be lighthearted fun story, but at times the suffering, that one could be sure Maggie was going through, was pushed to the background.This was a fun Traveling Sister read and as always we had great discussions on this book."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332895-lori", "userReview": "An inspirational story that kept getting better and better as the story progressed.

You have to find inspiration in the struggle, and\u00a0pull joy out of the hardship.\u201d\n\n In my opinion, this story reads as if it were a nonfiction memoir. I actually paused to research Katherine Center and her tragic accident only to find that this was fiction. This was my first Katherine Center novel so I hadn't a clue. Ms. Center certainly did her homework though, and according to her acknowledgements, she researched multiple elements of this story by spending time with people who have firsthand experience (even with eating an entire blob of wasabi apparently). In my opinion, Ms. Center took a huge risk writing from the POV of a character struggling so deeply with something she has never physically experienced, while many people may be currently in the midst of it thinking \"easier said than done, lady\", but I think it paid off. Like I said, it felt like a real-life account and I found the overall theme incredibly inspirational and easily transferable to many of life's hardships. With plenty of humor, perspective, inspiration, and a touch of drama and romance, How to Walk Away has earned its rapidly rising attention in my opinion.
