{"ratings": 0, "userreviews": [], "description": "Most great opportunities fail. The #1 reason: companies can't effectively scope their best opportunities. Scoping is where failure rates are highest. Now, discover how to use design thinking to radically improve the way you scope opportunities, and integrate opportunity development into a complete innovation framework that works.   Design Process and Opportunity Development  is part of Philadelphia University's breakthrough approach to innovation: one that links business, design and engineering, and delivers extraordinary results in both new and existing ventures. First, Dr. Stephen Spinelli and Heather McGowan introduce this \"Disrupt Together\" approach, explain its deep roots in design thinking, and show how it generates far more high-value ideas for innovation. Next, Tod Corlett drills down to focus specifically on using team-based design thinking to clarify your challenges, articulate your value propositions, and reach new markets. You'll learn why design processes are so well-suited to today's fast-moving world of diverse teams, accelerated product life cycles, disruptive innovation, and social media - and how to apply them in your environment. Corlett shows how to rapidly iterate and improve your ideas... use helical thinking to move forward, not \"in circles..\". and use funnels to consistently select your best conceptual options.   Design Process and Opportunity Development  is one of 15 e-chapters addressing all facets of innovation, from design processes and team development to business models and value delivery. Each is crafted by a pioneering business innovator - and they all integrate into today's most coherent, realistic blueprint for innovation. For all entrepreneurs, executives, managers, strategists, and students who want to drive more value from innovation. Tod Corlett, Associate Professor of Industrial Design at Philadelphia University, directs its Master of Science in Industrial Design program, and oversees its innovation-research and technology initiatives. Previously an award-winning lead designer for Cloud Gehshan Associates in Philadelphia, he maintains a design practice, Public Works, focused on design for public spaces. He holds a BA from Yale University, and BFA and M.I.D. degrees from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.", "title": "Design Process and Opportunity Development (Chapter 8 from Disrupt Together)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24904088-design-process-and-opportunity-development", "average": 0.0, "cover": "", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8558681.Stephen_Jr_Spinelli", "name": "Stephen Jr Spinelli"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/178669.Heather_McGowan", "name": "Heather McGowan"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24904088-design-process-and-opportunity-development", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28002995-interdisciplinarity-innovation-and-transforming-healthcare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23215688-becoming-a-strategic-organization", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23215712-opportunities-in-branding---benefits-of-cross-functional-collaboration-i", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23215709-disrupting-yourself---launching-new-business-models-from-within-establis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24904089-design-process-and-opportunity-development"]}
