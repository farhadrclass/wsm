And he is obsessed with history.What he found so fascinating about the idea of history was that it was based on a chemical compound of fate, chance, and design. The combination of these three elements produced a chain of events that produced another chain of events, which were said to be inevitable, or random, or to happen according to a secret plan that was not yet known to us, though by now things were getting pretty esoteric.Like Ulysses he travels all over the world and everywhere he goes he takes his camera along and films the present to make it available to the others when it will become the past\u2026Odysseus had been cunning, but not free. Or about as free as he himself was. Our crafty hero had needed to be rescued countless times by Athena, who had come to him in a variety of guises. There she was again \u2013 the goddess. But could she still work her magic?\u2026He looked up at the statue of Athena, but her eyes looked right past him. Gods never saw you unless they wanted to. Odysseus had been lucky \u2013 someone had pointed him in the right direction. She could have come up with a simpler solution, but it wouldn\u2019t have made as good a story. He filmed a scene he\u2019d filmed before, a long sweep beginning with Potsdamer Platz, moving slowly over to the Brandenburg Gate and ending by the Reichstag.One day he encounters a woman, she is a historian, a medievalist \u2013 both of them have deep psychological wounds, they are scorched by their past, they attempt to love each other but they live in the present\u2026Where she was headed he didn\u2019t know, but he could feel that they were almost there. A door, a man with a shaved head whose face he didn\u2019t trust, a mechanical beat coming from downstairs, light from the underworld, unsavory characters leaning against a bar \u2013 Gegenmenschen, he called them, a new subspecies of humanity. Their voices didn\u2019t sound like those of his friends. They spoke in evil drawls, the language of caves.She seemed to know them, to assume a different voice, a kind of shout to be heard above the music, heavy metal, the sound of a factory producing nothing but noise, pounding figures on a dance floor, slave laborers working on an absent product, contorted bodies moving in time to a merciless beat, writhing with every lash of the whip, screaming along with what they seemed to recognize as words, a German chorus from Hell, raw voices scraped over jagged iron, poisonous metal.Gegenmenschen \u2013 people who hated silence. XTC users, speed freaks, cokeheads, vanitas faces with thin bodies in chic rags.There are two worlds: the world of love and the world of hate. Majority of human beings endeavour to live in the world of love but those who live in the world of hate rule\u2026"}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13069324-elena", "userReview": "There are many books that I read in the course of the year and enjoy, some that I enjoy immensely. These books I close with a sigh and indulge in a bit of reflection. Their contents pop up in my thoughts frequently over the next few days - after that, less frequently, but still occasionally stopping by. All Souls Day is not one of those books. All Souls Day is a book which for me finished rather undramatically. There was no moment of reflection. There was an awareness, rather, that the journey it had taken me on had been a journey of moments, becoming clear in intent only towards the end. I also knew that I had no need to reflect briefly, because the words, the story, the characters, the images and the ideas had become embedded in me. No need to have a gentle goodbye. This is a book that will continue on with me. A book that will be one of that rather tiny collection which I will read repeatedly because although they are embedded in me, there is often a need for a reminder, a need to take the journey again. All Souls Day is a book that travels like life itself. As I read along, I felt no desire or need for plot - something of a plot emerged gradually, but the captivating part was the flow of the book itself. I could not stop reading it just as I cannot stop walking through my own life. And yet at times I read it gradually, as if afraid to go too fast, afraid to bring it to a close. Beautiful and full, All Souls Day captures the magic of the everyday - its accomplishment is the same thing that its main character strives to do in his bits of film, the ones he rarely shows any one but keeps for itself. There is so much more that is in this book and I know that each further reading will be just as rich as the first, perhaps even more so. There are explorations of city, of culture and character, and of history and its impact on all of these. The connections among all the different themes becoming clearer as the book progresses, but there is never a lecture or a final conclusion imposed on the reader. The final thought offered is gentle and allows the readers to do with it what they please."}, {"userName": "Steffi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2632212-steffi", "userReview": "Wunderbar melancholische Beschreibungen Berlins Mitte der 90er Jahren, die immer wieder an Wenders Film \u201eDer Himmel \u00fcber Berlin\" erinnern, auch wenn der im Jahrzehnt zuvor spielt: Die graue Tristesse des Berliner Winters, Begegnungen mit Menschen, Melancholie, die Stimmen von Engeln, Seelen?

Set between Amsterdam, Berlin and Spain, the story spans personal and national history and interweaves them in the creation of a world of its own without being doctrinal: The author knows that historiography is never fully possible without being mixed up with interpretation - the same is of course valid in the description of characters and their actions and Nooteboom shows this in the use of an omniscient chorus similar to greek tragedy which comments on the novel from outside.Nooteboom knows Spain and he knows Berlin, and his account of the separated and recently re-united city and its still open wounds nobody cares to see any longer is cleverly complemented with the personal biography of the main characters, impeccable Dutch film-maker Daane who's lost his first wife and son in a plane accident and the woman he falls in love with, Elik Oranje, half-Dutch, half-Spanish, with a very visible scar in her face. While Elik's vulnerability is aggressively shown, nobody can easily look behind Daane's facade which is hidden behind his camera. This camera not only captures the great tragedies of war and catastrophes all over the world, but also the small things our life is full of: just like the discussions Daane and his circle of friends have (ranging from sausages to the exploration of the space back to Nietzsche and Hegel) and the book itself. Death, love, the passing of time, history and its effects on daily life, friendship and philosophy - great topics discussed in this great book by an author who handles them with ease."}, {"userName": "Peter Ka", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5983155-peter-ka", "userReview": "Just boring.

In fact, in the first half from the book we can draw a lineal line of time of two days long forth, and a winding line back, many years ago. The important here is the winding line, that is made of past facts, little dialogues, old thoughts, all related with that flow-consciousness. We can reconstruct the life of Arthur Daane (The principal character), a part from the Europe history, have a glimpse of the idiosyncrasy of different countries or of the same (For example, the story is set little years ago of the wall, so,converge the west and east, the Russian, the Netherlander) and all is exposed with a philosophical point of view.

Berlin takes important place in this novel, especially as an illustration of the troublesome dealing with the past. The interventions of the choir are very successful and explain the fundamental theme: the weight of the past.  The story around Elik is not very credible (in fact the figure itself is very volatile), especially the end with the resurrection is very weak. Moral: \"we need to distance ourselves from the past, in order to live!\", sounds pretty clich\u00e9.

And it would continue to exist until the act of describing the world ceased to exist, together with the world itself.\"I am writing this just ten days after Brexit, and it is a difficult time for me because the event has dealt a severe blow to one of the most wonderful ideas in world's political history - the unification of Europe in the form of the EU. That the countries such as Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy and many others - despite a thousand years' worth of wars, hate, and killing - have been able to overcome their national prejudices in the interest of people rather than just \"our people\" was an event on a scale never experienced in human history. Well, now it seems clear that we have just been deluded and that Europe will merrily go back to the old ways of nationalism and division.What does it all have to do with Cees Nooteboom's All Souls' Day (1998)? I am sure that Mr. Nooteboom is very sad today too. He is not just a Dutch writer as his nationality and native language indicate, but a quintessential European writer, and this novel is one of the most European of serious books that I have ever read. Among the major themes in All Souls Day are the European history, culture, art, philosophy, ways of thinking, even food. Most of the novel is presented as a stream of thoughts of a highly educated intellectual and as conversations with other intellectuals. Arthur, the narrator, is a free-lance TV documentary director and cameraman, and among his closest friends are a sculptor, a philosopher/writer, and a physicist. We read about the art of Vermeer, Heidegger's Sein zum Tode, Hegel's philosophy of history, Penderecki's Stabat Mater, the gender markings in European languages, the kingdom of Le\u00f3n-Castilla under queen Urraca in the early 12th century, the cathedral in Madrid, the tunnel underneath Alcal\u00e1, Krzysztof Pomian's essay Histoire et Fiction, and also about Saumagen, Apfelstrudel, and various types of sausages. Arthur's stream of thoughts transcends national identities and languages: his thoughts are not Dutch or German or French, they are thoughts of an European.In All Souls' Day Mr. Nooteboom returns to the main themes of his most famous novels: the time and space dimensions of human life, human impermanence, the ways in which the past exists, and how we, the living, relate to people who had been close to us and who died. One of the most moving passages describes Arthur's conversation with an old woman living in a block of apartments in Berlin. She is looking at a tree that has always been growing in front of her window. The tree had been small when the woman and her husband had lived there before World War II. The husband was killed on the Eastern front, but the woman, some fifty years later, still talks to him and tells him about the tree: \"I tell him how the tree is doing, how big it's grown. He can't understand the rest, how everything has turned out. I don't dare tell him.\" Whenever I read this fragment I choke and my eyes get wet. Indeed, the dead would not understand all the rest. But we do have the obligation to the people who had departed: we need to think about the times we had together. Talking to our dead makes them exist again, just a little. There is so much more in the novel. Arthur's narration is interrupted a few times by a voice that resembles the chorus from a classic Greek drama. Sometimes this collective disembodied voice (all souls' voice?) comments on the events, but mainly it provides a wider perspective on the themes and motifs in the text. For instance - in keeping with the meditative mood of the novel - the voice muses on the power of human intellect that \"can ponder eternity\" and \"allows you to lay claim to vast amounts of time and space,\" on the random intersections of human trajectories in space and time, and on the non-existence of the future. One will also find a most unusual description - in its understatement - of a person's death. Readers should be aware that All Souls' Day may only barely be counted as a novel. The plot is thin: Arthur, who lost his wife and son ten years ago in a plane accident, spends time in Berlin, waiting for his next assignment, wandering all over the city, sitting with his friends in caf\u00e9s and Weinstubes and discussing art and philosophy. He meets a young woman, Elik Oranje, a graduate history student and a complicated yet instant attraction arises between them. The story continues about the time they spend together in Berlin and then about Arthur's search for Elik in Spain, where she goes to look for source materials to her dissertation.Despite many utterly beautiful passages and themes All Souls' Day feels a little bit overlong. unfocused and occasionally rambling; it does not reach the greatness of, for example, \nThe Following Story\n or \nThe Foxes Come at Night\n, which are meditations of unsurpassed depth on the existence of past and our impermanence. But it still is a wonderful book and it makes it crystal clear that the writings of no other author I have ever read resonate stronger with my worldview and sensibilities.Four and a quarter stars."}, {"userName": "Marjanneke", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63574646-marjanneke", "userReview": "Ik vond het een lastig te lezen boek, en het is denk ik een boek wat je zeker een tweede keer moet lezen om er meer van te begrijpen.

I found the historical discussion very interesting, especially as it plays out between Arthur Daane and his friends and love interest. Arthur is the main character, a middle-aged man who lost his wife and son years ago in a place crash, and (perhaps because of that loss) who tends to take history, especially the 20th century European kind, very personally and is obsessed with discovering and treasuring the marks it has left behind in Berlin, where he spends most of his time. His inability to distance himself from what has happened is contrasted by his friends, one of whom is a historian who enjoys the things that have been remembered after their time has vanished, such as music and art, and another a Russian woman who survived the siege of Leningrad during WWII, and who instead interest herself in space technology and the things that are to come. I would glady have read more about how people interact in different ways with the things that are left behind by history, both personal memories and things such as art, buildings and other physical marks, even if I found Arthur and his insistence on the importance of preserving those things a bit frustrating. Instead, about a third of the way in, Arthur becomes interested in and starts trying to track down a young woman he sees briefly in a cafe, and an unsatisfying love story takes over the book.The love story involves Elik Oranje, a young woman who's working on a doctorate in history about an early Spanish queen, and who has a traumatic past that has led her to avoid personal entanglements and instead focuses on discovering the traces that can be found in archives and books. I'm not sure love story is really the right word, since Elik makes it clear from the start that she's not interested in becoming involved with Arthur, who has to accept what she chooses to give him. This holds true up until the end of the book, and so most of the time Arthur spends his time chasing after her without knowing where she is or how to find her, and trying to interpret her actions and words for signs of what's really going on. It doesn't help that Arthur himself isn't very good at expressing himself and spends most of the time when he's with his friends or Elike not saying anything or trying to tell them what he's thinking without really succeeding. I found it impossible to tell if Nooteboom found the love story as frustrating as I did, or if he though that Arthur's inability to say enough and stop trailing after Elike a sign of devotion."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert", "userReview": "When I was reading All Souls Day I was reminded of those obscure European art house films I used to watch when I was in my early twenties. Slightly weird, interesting and yet lacks something in order to be truly loved.Arthur Daane is a director of documentaries and treats is life as one whole film that is waiting to be captured on camera. Although he has travelled to some places around the Earth his favourite city is Berlin and while he walks he notices (and films) the details and soaks in the city\u2019s rich history. He also meets his two eccentric friends Arno and Victor and they discuss life food, art and history.The reason Arthur travels and notices details in the places he goes to is because his wife and son have died in a plane crash ten years earlier and he sees his obsessions as a from of escape.All goes well until Arthur falls in love and he goes on another adventure which is completely life changing.The main theme is history, especially Berlin\u2019s. Nooteboom makes sure to squeeze in every aspect of pre wall era Berlin and I liked this aspect of the book. The romantic sub plot works as well and gives the novel an extra dimension. Even the inclusion of a narrator who breaks the fourth wall and tells us about the future of some of the characters is a great idea.Yet I found it difficult to be absorbed in the story. I definitely did not get bored and neither is the translation off-putting. I just felt that it lacked one more thing and I\u2019m still debating on what it is. True some of the characters aren\u2019t that fully fleshed out but we sympathise with Arthur very easily. I don\u2019t know what it is and it\u2019s still bothering me a bit.Another thing the paperback version is out of print but you can buy the hardback one at the Book Depository (although I opted for the paperback at abebooks.co.uk)"}, {"userName": "Ursula", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/991494-ursula", "userReview": "Arthur Daane is a Dutch expatriate living in Berlin. As we soon find out, he lost his wife and young son in a plane crash a while back. He is unmoored in just about every imaginable way - detached from his country, from his family, from himself. He has a small group of friends, artists of various types, and he has a job as a photographer. But he'd rather spend his time taking photos of people's feet on the streets of Berlin for reasons that are not clear to him.It's a book where not a lot happens, really. Arthur talks to his friends; he wonders what he's doing with his life and what he should be doing with it, if anything; he meets a woman. But the themes of what it means to belong and how we accomplish that when it isn't effortless are explored from a variety of angles. Nationality and language are nearly characters of their own, and Nooteboom has a number of interesting observations to make on those topics.One thing I wasn't sure how to react to was the periodic switch of narrators to some sort of omniscient, celestial (?) beings who talk about knowing everything that's going to happen, but only being able to watch it unfold. I never really warmed up to these sections, and became more annoyed with them as the book progressed. Perhaps the point went over my head, but I felt like those digressions were completely unnecessary.Recommended for: linguists, travelers, people who feel alone in a crowd.Quote: \"Owners - his term for them - of major languages, whether they spoke German, English, or Spanish, always seemed to take it for granted that the less fortunate, who had been saddled with a secret language, would see to it that they could make themselves understood to the rest of the world, despite their initial handicap.\""}, {"userName": "Yves Bekaert", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40888854-yves-bekaert", "userReview": "Veel handelingen zijn er niet in deze roman, maar wat er gebeurt, heeft een overdonderende lading. Voor het eerst schreef Nooteboom een roman van vierhonderd pagina's en het lijkt erop dat hij al zijn voorafgaande boeken in \u00e9\u00e9n overweldigende roman wilde samenvatten. Het is een roman van de levenden over de doden. De zielen van de gestorvenen kijken het hele jaar uit naar 2 november, die ene dag waarop ze herdacht worden. Maar voor hoofdpersonage Arthur Daane is het iedere dag Allerzielen. Hij is zo verstrikt in het verleden, dat hij zelf nauwelijks leeft. De angst dat herinneringen spoorloos verdwijnen, verlamt hem. Als cameraman die uitgestuurd wordt naar de brandhaarden in de wereld, heeft hij te maken met aanslagen, nekschoten en onthoofdingen. \u2018Het ergst was de vergetelheid die vrijwel onmiddellijk daarna inzette, de orde van de dag, alsof het er niet meer toe deed op een bevolking van zeven miljard.' Alles verdwijnt spoorloos, dit clich\u00e9 hangt als een doem over de roman. Het is alom vergetelheid in deze roman. Maar is er dan niet de kunst om daaraan te ontkomen? \u2018Ik moet daar vreselijk om lachen,' beweert de beeldhouwer Victor. \u2018Vooral schrijvers hebben daar een handje van, meesters van de toekomstige onsterfelijkheid. Sporen nalaten, noemen ze dat, terwijl wat zij doen, nog het snelste beschimmelt.'Maar Cees Nooteboom weet wel beter. Allerzielen is zijn weerwoord op de vergankelijkheid. Het aloude 'ars celare artem' beheerst de auteur dus wel degelijk in deze roman, die misschien wat traag op gang komt, maar in zijn geheel een hoogtepunt is in het oeuvre van Nooteboom. De waan van de dag heeft het afgelegd tegen de verbeelding, de enige macht die een schrijver heeft. Althans, voor een schrijver van het uitzonderlijke niveau als Cees Nooteboom."}, {"userName": "Steve Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30695734-steve-johnson", "userReview": "One of my favourite novels from Cees Nooteboom. I have to admit that I found it a bit hard and slow to get into at first, the first 150 pages or so I thought were kind of boring and the size of this novel is unusually large when compared with most other Nooteboom novels. It features trademark Nooteboom elements, but still initially I didn't like it as much.However this all changed a bit further in, at which point I could hardly stop reading. I had to stop myself because it was too great for it to be over too soon. From the moment I was hooked it only kept improving and by the end I was completely blown away. Great ending, great journey, great novel. I will be re-reading this book in the future for sure. Nooteboom is an excellent writer and I would very much recommend reading his other novels before reading this one because this one I think is harder to get into, harder to appreciate (at first), but very much worth it after being more accustomed to Nooteboom's writing! One of the quotes from this book I really liked:\"Als wij geen namen zouden hebben, zou alles veel duidelijker zijn. Gewoon wat vluchtige materie met een beetje bewustzijn, verschijningen die komen en tamelijk snel weer verdwijnen. Door die namen denken we dat we heel wat zijn, we denken misschien zelfs dat ze ons beschermen, maar wie weet nog de namen van alle miljarden die verdwenen zijn?\""}, {"userName": "Coulter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4705812-coulter", "userReview": "This would get five stars if it were a collection of essays or short stories - I kept noting down things I wanted to remember from it - but, as it is billed as a novel, I'm going to dock it a star for being just a bit too static and, more importantly, for not developing the side characters more: the main character (a Dutch film-maker living in Berlin) has a circle of friends in Berlin that he spends much of the novel chatting to, but they come across more as mouthpieces for various (often philosophical) points of view than real characters. Anyway, if you want to read very clever musings about the differences between the Dutch and Germans, or about the futility of trying to understand past periods of history - juxtaposed with the futility of trying to hold on to one's *own* past, I highly recommend it. One favorite line on archiving things in libraries as a struggle against our own mortality: \"Als we iets, wat dan ook, van het verleden laten sterven kan ons dat ook overkomen, en dat kon alleen maar door deze bewaarzucht bezworen worden.\" (\"If we allow something, anything, from the past to die, it can happen to us too, and that can only be charmed away through this desire to store things.\") Yes, for the record, I'm a hoarder."}], "description": "A profound and searching new work from one of Europe's major contemporary writers. Arthur Daane, a documentary film-maker and inveterate globetrotter, has lost his wife and child in a plane crash. In ALL SOULS' DAY we follow Arthur as he wanders the streets of Berlin, a city uniquely shaped by history. Berlin provides the backdrop for Daane's reflections on life as he plans his latest project - a self-funded film that will show the world through Daane's eyes. With a new circle of friends - a philosopher, a sculptor and a physicist - Arthur discusses everything from history to metaphysics, and the cumulative power of remembered images and philosophical musings on the meaning of our contemporary existence comes to permeate the atmosphere of the book. Then one cold, wintry day, Daane meets the young history student Elik Orange and his world is turned upside down. Whenever this mysterious woman beckons, Daane is compelled to follow. ALL SOULS' DAY is, finally, an elegiac love story in which the personal histories of the characters are skilfully interwoven with the history of the countries in which they find themselves.
