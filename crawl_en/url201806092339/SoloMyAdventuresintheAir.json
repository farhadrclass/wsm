I didn't expect it to focus so much on Vietnam or end on a somber note. I was expecting Richard Bach and I got Al Santoli (which would be fine if that's what I had signed up for). Worth the read, but not at the top of the list."}, {"userName": "Robert Alderink", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5947434-robert-alderink", "userReview": "This book is a great read for anyone interested in flying. Nearly four decades ago, during the summer between my senior year in high school and college, I took flying lessons. The early chapters of this book took me back to that time and place. Edgerton's description of his first solo flight echoed my experience precisely. It reminded me of a day I will never forget!"}, {"userName": "Nann", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17409191-nann", "userReview": "Novelist Edgerton switches to nonfiction for this memoir of his life-long love of flying, from childhood fascination to Air Force ROTC and a tour in Vietnam to owning his own plane (for far too short a time). The inspiration for scenes in his books comes from several real-life episodes."}, {"userName": "Limopilot", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4640219-limopilot", "userReview": "Absolute must read for those of us who love to fly. Filled with more than a few personal experience stories, this is a page turner for the pilot. It has some humor, some drama, and some story-telling that sll can get involved with, but certainly the aeronautic fanatic should pick this one up."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11882630-karen", "userReview": "Another great read, this one about the author's war years, the thrill of flying and then reconciling his pre-war and post-war beliefs. Especially interesting to those of us who were of age during the Vietnam War."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2671344-valerie", "userReview": "So far, this has given me new appreciation for the computer flight simulators that my father loves so much!

Edgerton's experiences as a private pilot and then a military pilot provide many exciting and funny anecdotes. A charming book for anyone."}, {"userName": "R.L.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2102504-r-l", "userReview": "Thoughtful book from one of my favorite authors. Thank you, Mr. Edgerton."}], "description": "When Clyde Edgerton was four years old, his mother took him to the local airport to see the planes. For Edgerton, it was love at first sight. Eighteen years later, she would take him to the same airport to catch a flight to Texas for Air Force pilot training. In Solo, Edgerton tells the story of his lifelong love affair with flying, from his childlike wonder to his job as a fighter pilot flying reconnaissance over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Now, nearly thirty-five years after the war in Vietnam, he looks back at his youthful passion for flying, at the joy he took in mastering it, at the exhilaration\u2014and lingering anguish\u2014of combat flying. It is a story told with empathy and humor\u2014and with searing honesty that will resonate with every pilot who remembers the first takeoff, the first landing, the first solo. For the nonpilots who always choose the window seat, it\u2019s a thrilling story to live vicariously.", "title": "Solo: My Adventures in the Air", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262389.Solo_My_Adventures_in_the_Air", "average": 3.53, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404581803l/262389.jpg", "reviews": 8, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/42288.Clyde_Edgerton", "name": "Clyde Edgerton"}], "type": ["Biography", "Aviation", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262389.Solo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/330469.Solo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10870394-solo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74616.Walking_Across_Egypt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262392.Raney", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2451044.The_Bible_Salesman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262391.The_Floatplane_Notebooks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262390.Lunch_at_the_Piccadilly"]}
