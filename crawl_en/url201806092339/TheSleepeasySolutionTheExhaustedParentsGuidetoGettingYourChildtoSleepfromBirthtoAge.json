This will likely be the last one I pick up. There was nothing inherently wrong with the advice given here (another modified CIO approach to infant sleep) but I've realized that my little one will STTN when she's ready and that - for now - several wakings during the night is normal and okay (particularly as she is EBF and not yet eating solids). In my opinion, western society is way too obsessed with this notion that a baby MUST sleep through the night at such young ages. I've come to cherish the quiet night time together and appreciate the fact that we have these moments to cuddle - especially because I am apart from her so long during the day M-F. Yes, I often start my days tired but that's what coffee is for, right? As for going to sleep in her crib, we've got that down and our method goes against what CIO practioners advise (I nurse and rock her until she's asleep in my arms. Then I gently place her in her crib. Around midnight when she wakes up for the first time, I bring her to bed with me and we cuddle/nurse/sleep the rest of the early morning. CIO has never worked for her - she seems to get more wound up rather than the opposite and her screams were just too awful for me to endure.) This provides me with a few hours of sleep alone in my bed (well, with my husband) before she joins us.Hey, it works for us and, at the end of the day (literally!) that really all that matters, right? Everyone's got to find the best way for them."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/208876-hannah", "userReview": "Absolutely saved my sanity and helped my daughter to learn excellent sleeping skills. I chose this book in a haze from the bookshelf at Borders one day after a major regression in my child's sleeping patterns left the whole family with basically no sleep for days. I was so tired that I was on the verge of a meltdown and there was no end in sight. I'd tried everything I could think of to help her sleep and nothing was working anymore. The reason I grabbed \"Sleepeasy\" is because the print was large and there were sidebars with quick tips in them - in short - it was easy for an exhausted person to read and digest. Within a week of buying the book and applying the methodology, my daughter was going to bed and naps easily, sleeping through the night and in a MUCH better mood when awake!As time has passed and there have been disruptions in our routine, such as illness, developmental milestones, teething or travel, I've returned to the book to help us get back on track. \"Sleepeasy\" is such a godsend that I won't even loan it out to friends because I always want it easily on hand for reference if needed. This method of sleep training is not for every child, but it is certainly what my child needed and continues to thrive on."}, {"userName": "Paula ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2879703-paula", "userReview": "I wanted an easy solution to my son's sleeping issues.

If you're losing your mind from lack of sleep due to a miniature version of you, this book will help you solve that. We had tried reading a few other books but the methods seemed a little too draconian for our tastes. This book struck the perfect balance between crying it out and offering aid to your child, in the form of scheduled check-ins (with no contact whatsoever, just reassuring and encouraging words). My wife & I employed the methods on Thanksgiving night 2012 (our daughter was 9 mo old at the time), and it literally worked for us in 18 minutes! Two prescribed check-ins and 18 minutes of exorcist-worthy screaming and she has been a pro-sleeper ever since, now asking to be put down for bed or naps! If you're the timid type, try buying the accompanying DVD to see it work in action. I actually needed that because I'm often the one putting our little girl to bed and yes, I was very nervous, but the DVD was the coup de gras and I was ready for action."}, {"userName": "Becki", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4070808-becki", "userReview": "Ironically, I finished reading this book in the middle of the night when my 8 month old was refusing to sleep.

So I'm going to give this one a try. It promises results in less than a week for night time sleeping and a bit longer for naps (we need help there too).I liked the step-by-step approach and that I would read a section and then work on a specific section of our sleep plan.

Of all the sleep resources available to exhausted parents, the consensus seemed to be that this one worked, so when we decided it was time to try to improve our baby's sleep habits, we decided to make this our bible. That was a good choice.I read the first few chapters (which hold most of the key information) on a tough night, after a series of tough nights, when we decided enough was enough. I confess that it made me cry a lot, though that certainly was not the authors' intent. It just brought up every kind of mom emotion for me: the relief of being understood and knowing we were not alone in these challenges, guilt that we hadn't made these changes sooner for our baby and ourselves, gratitude that there appeared to be achievable solutions to the sleep issues we were struggling with, grief at having to give up some of the practices that were contributing to the problem (in particular, letting my baby fall asleep in my arms - inconvenient, but so very precious). I had to stop reading, because it was all too much.But I finished reading it over the next couple days, we put it into practice, and the process went so much better than we expected it to. As I type this, we are not quite a week in, and it's still a bit bumpy at times (naps especially), but it has already made such a positive difference in our lives.I needed to read this book so much that I can't really be objective in my critique of it. I did notice some assumptions about gender roles and spousal relationships that don't reflect the diversity of modern families, which might trouble some readers more than others. It did bother me, but not enough to outweigh the good. Overall I appreciated the tone of the book - it was written with great compassion for those reading it, and was honest and realistic about what's involved in the process they present. I am sure it will continue to be a valuable resource for us, and I would definitely recommend it to other families."}, {"userName": "Joanna Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62913243-joanna-martin", "userReview": "I know everyone is different and different methods work for different families, but this book 100% worked for us and I would recommend it to anyone trying to sleep train.

The first you can find here.\u00a0https://whimsywriter3.wordpress.com/2...I thought that The Sleepeasy Solution was a pretty helpful book, and it's one I'll probably read again once I actually have an infant. I really liked that the idea they presented of documenting your babies sleep habits and then creating a routine to go through every night with the child.\u00a0 That seemed really practical and helpful. I also liked the sample sleep schedules and how they broke it all down. It gave me ideas for how I want to create a sleep schedule in the future. Waking up early is one of my least favorite things and hopefully this book will help me with this.I did think the book was wee bit long again, it was almost 300 pages which is a bit much. And it got repetitive at times. I thought it was interesting that they were against swaddling. But personally I think you should take something like that on a baby by baby case. Some of my siblings seemed to like swaddling more than others.\u00a0In the end I gave the book four stars.

In desperation I downloaded this book into my Kindle. As I lied in bed with a baby nursing and my arm hurting from the side-lying position (which has been my permanent position for the past six months), I read the book thinking \"yeah right.\" The next day, exhausted from nursing all night and from getting very little real sleep I decided that enough was enough. I love my baby. I don't mind nursing and co-sleeping, but I knew that she was not getting enough sleep and neither was I. We were both very cranky and exhausted for the past few months. It's easier when you have children close in age (at least it was for me)because you are all pretty much on the same schedule. However, this baby is number four and eight years apart from the last child, which means that she goes to many events and is constantly on the go. Being on the go hasn't allowed for a structured nap schedule which means that I HAD to give her as much \"real\" sleep at night as possible. What we had been doing was nurse-sleeping and she was in a constant state of light sleep. Anyway, I JUST started The Sleepeasy Solution last night and baby slept in her co-sleeper for 12 hours! The hardest part were the first 30 minutes. Tonight, she went down at 8:00 PM and only fussed for about 7 minutes. I never got to the second or third check-ins. I like this solution because unlike the Ferber Method you don't just let the baby cry it out. This solution is much more friendly and you can customize it to fit your needs. I mean you don't want to customize so much that you are doing the same old thing that didn't work for you to begin with, but you can change the structure a little. It'll probably take longer to yield results if you don't follow it to the T, but it'll still work. I highly recommend this book and I highly recommend you do follow it as written because you will get results almost instantly. This morning I started to feel like my old self and my baby woke up with a big smile on her face. We thoroughly enjoyed our day with lots of play time and happy moments."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1664726-kristen", "userReview": "This is the baby sleep book I would recommend to others!The authors really have \"heart\" when it comes to helping a baby sleep. They understand the parent instinct to comfort an upset baby. I loved the detailed section based on different ages: 4-6 months, 6-9 months, 9-12 months, and so on.They introduced me to the concept of a \"dream feed\" rather than feeding my baby when she wakes. This way I don't have to expect her to sleep 12 hours through the night, but I do still expect her to fall back asleep on her own when she wakes at night. This is a concept I can get behind. I don't want to starve my daughter, but do want her to get closer to being able to sleep through on her own.The age specific nap information is also great. They talk about transitioning from 3 to 2 naps, and then from 2 to 1 nap. I was already a fan of scheduling naps for a fixed amount of time after the baby's last wake time. This just makes more sense to me than going strictly by the clock, since I know the baby doesn't know what time it is.Like most sleep training authors, they are cry-it-out advocates. Although they do make it clear that if you are reading their book you've tried your way of soothing, rocking, cuddling, etc and the baby just isn't sleeping the way you'd like. In fact, they don't think you should touch the baby at all when you go in for 5, 10, and 15 minute check-in.Side note: I find it curious that most development books say a 5 month old can probably sleep about 6 hours with out feeding, a six month old 8 hours. But books on sleep training, promise that in 1-2 weeks by using their methods any baby (sometimes as young as 6 weeks) will sleep 11-12 hours straight at night."}], "description": "Two experts who are helping Hollywood's A-list babies get their zzz's share the no-fail, family-friendly method that has helped thousands of sleep-deprived moms and dads.Even Hollywood's biggest stars face the same dilemma as other parents do: \"How do I get my child to sleep?\" As parents in the know are finding, whether they're on the red carpet or the soccer field, the answer is the same: The Sleepeasy Solution.Psychotherapists and sleep specialists Jennifer and Jill, the dynamic \"girlfriends\" all of Hollywood calls on to solve Junior's sleep problems, have perfected their sleep technique that will get any child snoozing in no time--most often in fewer than three nights.
