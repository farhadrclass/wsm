This book, which won the Pulitzer prize in 1931, was mentioned in a modern novel I had just read, and I was intrigued enough to go looking for it. I guess it's out of print. It wasn't on Kindle either and the ones for sale on Amazon were being sold at $50+. Don't know why? But I found my copy on Ebay, a leatherbound book I was able to get for $20. So needless to say, I was quite excited to get this book in the mail, and to start reading it. This novel gives a nice glimpse of life and American upper class society right before and after 1900. And while it is set in Chicago, and not New York, it reminded me a bit of Edith Wharton novels. But the best thing I got out of this novel was the way it made me think about how I would stand, personally, if faced with the question of taking happiness vs living with the choices I have already made in my life, given the effects such a decision would have on family and children. While I know which side I would be on; and the main character of the novel, Jane Ward, was clear as well about what she believed was the right way to be, she pondered the issue enough to at least recognize the merits of the other side, and to wonder if perhaps only time will tell which way works out best for the ones who make that kind of decision. I would give this book 3 1/2 stars."}, {"userName": "Sandy ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10715774-sandy", "userReview": "This family saga centres on the life of Chicago native Jane Ward and her upper-class family and friends. We meet her as a young teen and watch her transformation from carefree girl to independent Bryn Mawr student to reluctant wife to worrying mother and grandmother. With so many characters involved, there are plenty of interesting and surprising events to keep the reader's interest. I found myself looking forward to my next opportunity to read a chapter or two, always wondering what would be next!The story is well-written, but firmly set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with (some) corresponding outdated attitudes and social expectations, which may be a stumbling block for some readers. However, the issues and dilemmas which Jane faces throughout her lifetime are ageless and timeless and provide much \"food for thought\" for the reader.It is unfortunate that this winner of the Pulitzer of 1931 is out of print and consequently difficult to obtain. I was lucky enough to find a copy at a local university library -- it was in storage (in the sub-basement) and had not been checked out since 1965. It was duly retrieved and dusted off for me and, upon its return, will take its proper place in the stacks reserved for Pulitzer winners. It deserves to be resurrected and widely read!"}, {"userName": "Dree", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/837466-dree", "userReview": "At first I thought this book was going to be a nightmare to read--simple prose, all about a proper girl named Jane. But the story caught me. The prose began to strike me as simply being old-fashioned, as are words that you just don't hear much anymore (e.g. pigtails)--not hard words, just out-of-fashion words. I only had to look up one word* in the entire 500+ pages, which means easy old-fashioned reading!But in spite of the simple prose and vocabulary, the story does get good. Jane grows up, tries to please her family and fit in, attends 2 years of college, makes great friends, comes home, gets married, has and raises children, falls in love and makes a choice, and becomes a grandmother. Jane seems so simple, often confused, and just good. But is she really? And at what cost? Should she have made those choices? What does she know at 50 that she didn't know at 19 and 25? What truly matters? Happiness or duty? Can there be a compromise? Should we chase dreams and risk a good thing, or should we give up on joy for security?*smilax, which apparently was used to decorate at parties circa 1890-1930, is a plant genus.

Like the character of Jane, the protagonist, the writing itself is admirable and competent, but not exceptional nor all that very creative. Is it worthy of a Pulitzer? Hard to say, because it seems to fit a type that certainly was preferred by society and by the Pulitzer committee during the period of its publication in 1930 and its selection in 1931. But when you realize that Faulkner's \"As I Lay Dying\" was also published in the same year, you begin to think that the Pulitzer selection committee didn't know what the hell they were doing picking this book over Faulkner. But despite its lack of literary brilliance, I confess to enjoying it and would recommend it to others.What I most enjoyed about the book is its rather philosophically complex attempt to deal with human passion, love, happiness, and the passage of time. Although it pretends to project a kind of conservative preference for Victorian understandings of commitment, fidelity, morality, \"gracefulness,\" etc., it does push the envelope and question the certainty of what \"should\" be considered proper and moral in love and marriage. The main character, Jane Ward (later Mrs. Stephen Carver), is a very complex character. And many of the other female characters in the novel were also much more on the complex side. One would not expect this of a best seller (at least not one of today's best selling novels). Props to Barnes for her success as an author in this regard.What I didn't find all that impressive about the book was its very limited vocabulary and expressiveness. If she didn't use the word \"twinkling\" to describe a certain cleverly endearing look in the eyes more than 100 times, I'd be shocked. And that's just one of the more egregious examples of this limited descriptive capability. The novel is full of them. I also didn't find a lot of Jane's naivete about certain things to be really believable. A major failing of the book, though, is that Barnes just simply didn't manage to pass off the Jane/Jimmy love affair as believable. Not only did it seem forced and disingenuous; but it also seemed sordid and infantile.But perhaps the biggest flaw in the book is Barnes's utter inability to capture anything real and complex about any of the male characters in the story. She just couldn't pull it off. All the men in the novel were either one of two types: (1) the charming, dispassionate, good guy and steady/true husband and wise father -- albeit a bit clueless about love and passion, and always cuckolded --; and (2) the sneaky, handsome, rogue lady-killer and marriage-destroying gigolo doing the cuckolding. Yet the good guys, boring though they were, endured. The bad guys, as much as Barnes tried to humanize them, came off as caricatures and all came to tragic ends, getting their karmic comeuppance. I honestly didn't really like any of the men in the novel and thought that they were all portrayed simplistically in one of the two extremes. Had some of the male characters been written as complex people like the women were, the book would maybe have risen towards a higher plane of literary greatness. But Barnes just didn't have it in her, even though she tried.The final comment I'll make is that it is extremely difficult to find a copy of this book in the marketplace (at least for any decent price). It just hasn't captured the attention of any publishers to keep it in print. If you want to read this book, but don't want to spend $40 and up for an old, used copy from a second-hand dealer through Amazon.com or the online Barnes and Noble stores; you will be stuck searching for yellowed, dusty, and musty copies of it in College libraries. But make the effort to hunt one down, if for no other reason than to get a glimpse at another example of what passed for best-selling and critically-received (in its day) literature."}, {"userName": "Alexandra Harmon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5480734-alexandra-harmon", "userReview": "This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is one of those books that I will read several throughout my life, and get something new from it each time.Yes, it falls into the genre of \u201cchick-lit,\u201d but, it is so much more sophisticated than something like Little Women (sorry, Mom!). Jane is a completely likable, relatable character, but the author doesn\u2019t romanticize her and sees her with a certain amount of ironic detachment. She is spirited and loving, but loses her first love through her pettiness and pride. She rolls her eyes at the vulgar gossip of her mother and sister, while obsessing over a new dress or gaining attention from a new love interest a few pages later. When she is young, she loves her freedom; when she is old, she scoffs at her own children wanting the same.It became clear within the first few chapters that Ayers Barnes was a feminist, but the book never preaches. Unlike most chick-lit, both pulpy and literary, Years of Grace doesn\u2019t portray marriage as a finish line in the race to Happily Ever After. But neither is Jane\u2019s marriage some kind of mid-century Lifetime melodrama, with an abusive or domineering husband. Jane is sometimes miserable, sometimes content, and often bored with her kind but often oblivious husband. And their marriage goes through many natural changes as the two characters age.This book is rather slow-moving. But slow-moving doesn\u2019t have to mean boring.

The writing though, was almost just a list of things that happened. Like, \"Agnes went to the store. She bought cake there. She put the cake in the bag. She brought the cake home.

As alegrias e tristezas que qualquer pessoa pode experenciar. Problemas comuns mas que realmente importam s\u00e3o deliciosamente descritos neste livro. ADOREI. O tipo de livro que nos faz refletir sobre a mudan\u00e7a de nossas pr\u00f3prias opin\u00f5es a cada d\u00e9cada vivida. E como o pensamento de diferentes gera\u00e7\u00f5es mudam mas os fatos da vida s\u00e3o, em geral, sempre os mesmos.:: passagens ::Perhaps people were all bored most of the time after they were 36. perhaps being bored was just part of growing up and growing old. The excitement went out of things. Life no longer had a surprise up its sleeve. But still, after you were 36, you went on living for another 36 years or so. Living and thinking about annoying trifles. (Jane)... (Jane) had been endeavoring to think of herself as a \"middle-aged\" ... Middle age is from 35 to 50. But curiously enough, in spite of that social statement, Jane had continued, incorrigibly to think of herself as 'young\".At 36 the trick was not so much to look pretty as to look young. Beauty helped, of course, but not as much as youth. (JANE)Do beautiful rainbow - colored bubbles, all made up of watery ideas and soap vocabulary, floating airily, without foundation, in the void, mean nothing in your life.There's a lot of nomad in me, you know. I guess the tent got into my blood. I'd like to go around the world. Round and round it in circles. Round it in every latitude. (Jimmy)She is dancing barefoot by a bonfire in a hatter red shawl - dancing in the dark of the moon to the tinkle of a tambourine ... She had the courage of his convictions. (p. 3131, Jimmy)THERE ARE HIGHER THINGS THAN CONVICTIONS. (Jimmy)You do get over loving anyone. But you don't always regret that love in retrospective. (Jimmy)Half trues have no place in conjugal confidence. They are cowardly, misleading. They are really lies. Whereas silence was - merely silence. (Jane)... we always read everything when we're too young to know what it means. And the trouble with life is that we're always to busy to re-read it later. There's more sense in books than you'd really believe. Though, of course, they don't teach you anything vital you can't lear for yourself. (pg 352, Jimmy)When you love people, you've got to be decent. You want to be decent. You want to be good. Just plain goos - teh way you were taught to be. Love's the greatest safeguard in life when against evil. (pg 365, Jane)IT'S NOT SO MUCH WHAT YOU DO THAT MATTERS, AS WHAT YOU FEEL (pg 371, Jane)Curious, she thought, the gap between the points of view of different generations. The fact of life were always the same, but people bought about them so differently. New thoughts about the same old action. Was it progress or merely change? Sex was a loaded piste thrust in the hands of humanity. Her mother's generation had carried it carefully, fearful of a sudden explosion. Her generation waved it non chalantly about, but, after all, with all their carelessness, they didn't fire it off any oftener than his parents had. What if the next generation should take to shooting? Shooting straight regardless of their target. (p303, Jane)Your inner life - how confusing it all was! A chaos of conflicting loyalties! You would like to think, of course, that you were the sort of woman who was capable of experiencing, once and forever, a central, domination passion. But as far as the essential sense of emotional intimacy went, she might be \u2026( anyone's) \u2026 wife. Why had things turned out as they had? Predestination was probably the answer. Cause and effect. One thing leading to another. Free will was only a delusion. Why not turn fatalist, pure and simple, and not worry any longer? Not care.But you had to care about your children. Worry about them, too. You had to and you ought to. When you thought of them all theories of predestination where completely shattered. (p402, Jane)She felt herself suddenly submerge in an ignoble sense of relief at the realization of domestic decencies forever maintained, of vulgar complexities forever avoided. Were worlds well lost for love? \u2026 She only knew, now, that she had acted in response to an inner instinct so strong that love itself had stood vanquished before it. The instinct was victorious, but the victory was barren. She had tried to preserve the happiness of the others. In reward she had been left only with a feeble, futile feeling that, in any event, her own happiness could never been attained. A barren victory. A victory the was essentially a defeat --- (p414, Jane)(The father) He had worried and warned and watched and loved and sympathized over Jane for 41 years, and now he is dying. He was dying just a at the time Jane felt she could have rewarded his love and symphony as never before. There was no longer any necessity for worrying an warning and watching over her personal drama. She had grown up. Soon she would grow old. She saw life, mow, yet to eye with her father. She, too, had become a spectator. Her children had taken the stage. (p426. Jane)Safety first was always parental slogan. Parents invariably deplored everything the threatened their children's security. Whatever their own experience had been, they desire for the younger generation only the most conventional, the most convenient, kind of happiness. (p427, Jane)Parents knew little enough of the emotional lives of their children, but children knew nothing of the emotional lives of their parents. The emotional life of a parent was a fantastic thought.\u2026 Jane knew how they had looked. She had always known that because of the pictures in the red plush family album\u2026 She had non sense of the continuity of their personality. They had died young - those two young people. They had grown up into Mr and Mrs Ward, who had always seen to Jane, since her earliest memory, so staid, so styled, so more middle-age. (p247/248, Jane) ALL LIVES ARE DIFFICULT AT TIMES (Mr Ward)It was touching to think the anyone could have the courage to believe that life could begin over again at fifty. Love at fifty. Autumn blossoming. A freak of nature, like the flowers of the witch-hazel, bursting weirdly into bloom in October when all the others bushes were bare. (p641, Jane at Muriel late wedding)You fool the world, but you don't fool yourself. You may win the pot, but it's not worth the winning. (all pgs 465/466)But Jimmy was a gipsy. Jimmy loved success for the fun of it and comfort for the easy of it, but they would soon be bored him. Jimnmy could never have sat on this window-seat and looked at all those boats without wanting to charter a tug for Shanghai or Singapore. Jimmy would never have locked up his money in banks or sunk it in bricks and mortar \u2026 Jyimy's happiness was always just around the corner. (p541, Agnes)There couldn't be understanding between two generations. Love and sympathy, but never understanding. We must take our children's ideas on faith. We can never make them our own. Remember that and save yourself unhappiness.(p542, Agnes).You had to choose in life. And perhaps you never gave up anything except what some secret self-knowledge whispered that you did not really care to posses \u2026 She had made than in simplicity and sincerity and because of that curious inner scruple that 'Matthew Arnold had defined - \"the enduring power, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness.'

Although out-of-print, I was able to procure a copy of \"Years of Grace\" from my local Public Library (good for them!). This book tells the story of Jane Ward, from when she is 14 years old, until she is 51, and takes place primarily in Chicago from the 1890's to around the late 1920's. It was interesting to read about customs and traditions in those Victorian days. Many words used in the text are no longer used in modern novels, or mean something totally different. The book follows Jane's life, with her first-love experience as a teenager, her college years, young married with children, then later in life, with several grandchildren. We are also introduced to her childhood girlfriends and siblings, and follow their lives through the same time period. We are privy to Jane's thoughts as she struggles with her duties and expectations as a daughter, sister, and wife, social propriety, and the desires of her heart. She meditates \"Your inner life - how confusing it all was! A chaos of conflicting loyalties!\" The generational differences are not much different than what we see today. We see how far women's liberation has come in the last 100+ years, and that was very interesting. For example, in the Victorian age, a pregnant woman would not speak of her pregnancy, much less go out in public in a form-fitting outfit, as today. There were side-trips taken over the years to New York, and Europe, which added to the interest of the book.

Although it is not the most modern of writing stlyes, I thought that the book offered great reflection on the history of society and more specifically women's roles and attitudes in the early 20th century."}, {"userName": "Maura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7019167-maura", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this - a story of a life from childhood until the kids are grown.

It will not be to everyone's taste; it is slow in places, but that is part of its charm. It recounts the story of Jane -- a young woman from post Victorian time until WWI. A wonderful read for anyone who likes slow, introspective fiction. It captures the heart."}], "description": "She fought the battle of the generations victoriously because she understood both the years of grace and the age of jazz.
