It seems odd rating them individuality, it feels like they should just be one 600 page book, in which case I would give it 4.5 stars.Anyway, this was good, for the most part it wrapped up the characters from the first two books and we finally find out what happened to Suli (I'm not telling, though) as well as Sayward's father and Rosa the school teacher's daughter (interesting relationship there between Rosa and Chancey).Some things are left a mystery which I suppose is realistic but had I been Sayward I would have made it my business to find out about Portious' past. Some reviewers complain that this book focuses too much on Chancey, Sayward's youngest rather spoiled, sickly child. I didn't really find this so. You do need some direction in a story like this and he was most representative of the next generation, wanting things easier, despising the older pioneering forefathers, thinking that the flaccid, lazy man of today was going to be the world's salvation tomorrow etc. But it wasn't all about Chancey. How could it be when the author needs to wrap up a whole community of people? And the author does this well.I think \"The Town\" was a strong finale to this trilogy."}, {"userName": "BookSweetie", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2181868-booksweetie", "userReview": "A literary feast! My five stars is less for the THE TOWN (1950) alone and more for its being the culmination of THE AWAKENING LAND trilogy that included THE TREES (1940) and THE FIELDS (1946). (The three books came out separately before being joined in one volume initially during the 1960s.) ** I would not recommend reading THE TOWN without reading THE TREES and THE FIELDS first. Together they offer an astonishingly satisfying novel of the late 1700s and early 1800s in the pioneering world of the Old Northwest Territory (Ohio River country). Readers follow the life of the unforgettably hardy fictional female Sayward Luckett from her childhood encounter with the densely forested Ohio River frontier (in TREES) to her early adulthood (in THE FIELDS) to her later life and the lives of her children in THE TOWN. Conrad Richter received the PULITZER award in 1951 for this chronicle of ordinary pioneers and their far from ordinary lives. He researched the geography, history, folklore and language of the pioneering frontier of the newly formed American nation and transformed that research into a novel. I most admire the author's ability to inhabit the inner lives of the characters and to give their stories an authentic feel using language and dialog that emerge from a linguistic world now past."}, {"userName": "Hana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10571559-hana", "userReview": "A satisfying conclusion to Conrad Richter's family saga about pioneer life in the Ohio River Valley. Nothing could top The Trees, but I was pleased with the way the series wrapped up. As the trees are finally beaten and burned into submission, as a town grows up where once all had been wilderness, the old sense of community gives way to a rush of commerce, of getting and spending. Throughout, there is a sense of melancholy for all that has been lost, rather than a triumph at what has been gained. A thought-provoking Thanksgiving Day read. Much of the latter half of the novel revolves around Sayward's youngest son, Chancey who is something of an anomaly, a quiet young man, a bit of a loner in a large, gregarious, energetic family. I'm an outlier among my GR friends since I rather liked Chancey and, being somewhat like him myself, I appreciated his struggles. The resolution at the novel's close was touching and believable."}, {"userName": "Tweety", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21428432-tweety", "userReview": "I'm not sure what to rate this, 3 1/2? It's a good conclusion, nearly everything is wrapped up and it's as well written as the first two. My problem with it was mainly Chancey, who if I'd liked him would have been fine. Unfortunately he made me mad. and the whole last half of the book had me glad it wasn't all about him, and wishing that he would grow up. would I recommend you reading this? Yes, you really can't miss the concluding tale. Am I glad I read it? I wouldn't have missed it, I'd have always wondered what happened to Sulie. Would I reread it? Maybe, right now I really don't know. That said, Sayward is as steady as ever, and I think she's my favorite character in the series. I had hoped Portius never grew on me, in fact by the end I had the feeling he had a winner in Sayward and she had drawn the short straw. Oh, well. This series is realistic. Not everything goes perfect.I'll probably revise my review later when I'm more she of my opinion on it."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946241-patricia", "userReview": "The last of the series. The Trees have been cleared, the farms have become successful, now it is time to move to town. I highly recommed this series. I will never forget Sayward and the Wheeler family.

It has been a very long time since I have been so moved by a novel -- indeed I was enraptured by the entire series. I find myself still fading into 19th Century Ohio, and meeting Sayward's ghost out of the corner of my eye, she is still so present within me. Richter does for 19thC America what Dickens did for 19thC England: vivid, animated, theatrical; brilliantly painted. I could pull out the thesaurus at this time, and just use all the words therein to describe a scintillating read, and that might just be enough!The Town encompasses the span of Sayward's life as she makes the move from \"cabin to county seat\", but we are left wondering if, after all, civilization is not a double-edged sword. When we first encounter Sayward, in the first book of the trilogy, we battle the paradox of nature with her: the cruelty and the kindness of it; the beauty, and its darkness. Similarly, we explore those themes within this last novel, but this time battling with the paradox of humanity: whether we are better off as simple citizens of the world, struggling daily for our bread; or whether the work of the mind is the nobler struggle. Richter leaves no doubt which he champions -- but I will not spoil the exploration for you!If you are looking for a good, old fashioned read, that engages mind and soul, and demands something of you, while entertaining you beyond measure, this is a must-read!"}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41436-nick", "userReview": "I was actually a little disappointed in the final book of what was otherwise a wonderful trilogy. The new character of Chancey was a major drag on the overall tone of the story. I believe Richter was doing this to make a point about how the current generation views past generations, but Chancey was so negative as to drag down the tone of the story as a whole. Additionally, the character's issues were finally resolved in literally the last three pages of the book: not quite the catharsis I was looking for from such a negative character. As a whole though, the series was very well written and researched, and paints a vivid picture of the settlement of the early frontier and America's journey from colony to nation."}, {"userName": "Harold Titus", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6710404-harold-titus", "userReview": "What distinguishes a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel from well-written novels that do not win prestigious awards? I would assert a deeper exploration into the psyche and behavior of the human species. I would also suggest an undertaking of far greater depth and scope than the attention-gaining, quick-moving, character-conflict- resolution-end of story kind of novel. I believe \u201cThe Town\u201d meets these conditions.I appreciated these three themes. The accomplishments that one generation achieves and the people who achieve them are too frequently discounted by people of succeeding generations tempted to believe, because their lives have been made easier, that they are more enlightened, superior.Every child born of the same parents is different from his/her siblings, but all, usually, adopt the broad values inculcated during their upbringing. But there can be outliers that parents may never direct.Great harm can be done to innocent children by cruel attitudes and acts of adults who adhere to rigid moral codes.Intertwined in the revelation of these themes are two important characters: Chancey Wheeler, the youngest of Sayward and Portius Wheeler\u2019s ten surviving children, and Rosa Tench, Portius\u2019s illegitimate daughter.Chancey Wheeler is the outlier of the Wheeler children. Unlike his siblings, he is born with a delicate constitution. He is sickly, physically weak, and seemingly handicapped by a weak heart. During his first several years of life he is frequently carried to places in and close to the family house rather than be expected to walk. Deprived of normal activity, he spends most of his time inert. Much of that time he fantasizes. He resents his siblings\u2019 robustness. In his late teens he acknowledges the reasons for his dislike of them. \"They were so sufficient to themselves, he thought. That was it. Nothing stopped them. Any one of his people could go it alone, ask for no quarter, do without your help. \u2026 If only there had been another in the family puny, lazy and cowardly like he! Just the thought of having such a brother or sister, perhaps one even worse than he was, lifted him up, made him feel better. But his mother wouldn\u2019t admit he was puny or cowardly or anything else that wasn\u2019t good. He was strong as anybody else, she claimed. \u2026 But nobody could make that much out of him, Chancey told himself, for none understood him save Rosa.\" He believes his mother resents him. He convinces himself that Sayward and Portius are not his parents and he longs for the day when his real parents will take him away. He tells fantastic stories \u2013 for instance, he rode in to town once on the back of a red cow \u2013 and insists that they are true. As he matures, he resists doing menial work. In his middle teens he meets Rosa Tench and finds her to be an unthreatening, accepting soul. Eventually, he leaves the home and start a career as a newspaper editor. He is harshly critical of Sayward\u2019s generation and of his oldest brother, Resolve, who has become governor of the state. He steadfastly believes that his mother is cruel to him by insisting that he not be soft and lazy. Eventually, Sayward blames herself for his shortcomings. \"Where she made the mistake was letting a little sickness coddle him. Had she brought him up rough and tumble like his brothers and sisters, he\u2019d know how to call back worse names than he got, and then the others would be glad to leave him alone.\" He rejects everything Sayward values -- especially the virtue of hard work -- which he believes are old-fashioned, out-of-date. In his late teens he and Sayward have this conversation.\"This spring he tried every excuse to get out of working in the lot and garden. When she held him to it, he cried out it was a disgrace. She was thunderstruck though she tried not to show it.'Why is honest work a disgrace?'she wanted to know.'It\u2019s all right for those who have to,' he told her. 'But you\u2019re the richest woman in Americus and I\u2019m your son and yet we have to go out and work like hired men in the field.'It came to her mind to say, I thought you said you weren\u2019t my son, but never would she cast that up to him.'Work\u2019s the best thing we can do, Chancey,' she said.\"Caught up with fanciful notions of an enlightened society \u2013 justification to excuse his aversion to work -- he responds this way.\"'\u2026 progress will do away with all toil and labor in time. \u2026 There\u2019ll be no rich people and no poor people, just brothers and sisters. And everybody will have security and happiness.'Sayward answers.'Making a body happy by taking away what made him unhappy will never keep him happy long. The more you give him, the more he\u2019ll want and the weaker he\u2019ll get for not having to scratch for hisself.'\"Chancey is an unsympathetic character throughout the novel.Rosa Tench is the consequence of Portius\u2019s marital infidelity with the town\u2019s school mistress, Miss Bartram, who marries a local laborer, Jake Tench, prior to Rosa\u2019s birth. These events occur in Conrad Richter novel, \u201cThe Fields.\u201d Neither Rosa nor Chancey know of their blood relationship. Mrs. Tench, following Rosa\u2019s birth, becomes an isolate, never leaves her house, is slovenly, lives only to identify with characters in novels. Rosa is an entirely different child than are her brothers, who are ordinary and rather crude.We meet Rosa initially in a fascinating scene fairly early in the novel.Portius, suffering a high fever, is being nursed back to health. Rosa\u2019s father, in a drunken state, wanting to prick Portius\u2019s conscience, sends Rosa to the Wheeler house with a batch of flowers. Sayward answers a gentle knock on the front door.\"Her slender legs looked like they never belonged in that coarse gray calico dress she had on, and her white face had the singular shape of one of her blossoms. Washed and rightly dressed and combed, she would be oddly beautiful, Sayward thought. Now the little girl just stood there, not saying a word.\"Sayward gets Rosa to identify herself.\"The sound of the name gave Sayward a turn. For a minute she just stood looking. So this was the child conceived in sin by the pretty school mistress who, they said, looked like a hag now, and would not set foot out of her house since the babe was born, nor would she wash or comb! Why, the girl was no bigger than Chancey, though she must be a year or two older. And now Sayward knew, with the feel of knife in her side, who the girl looked like.Did the girl know it, too? Her face quivered.'I brought some flowers for Mr. Wheeler,' she said, very low, holding out her handful.'I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be much obliged to you,' Sayward told her, sober as could be, taking them from her, steeling herself, hardening her hand toward the soft clinging feel of those fingers, Now how much did the child know, she wondered. 'Did you bring those your own self or did somebody tell you to?' she asked.'My father told me.' The girl\u2019s eyes were like the most ethereal of wide slaty gray liquid curtains that threatened to be torn down.\"Sayward recognizes Jake Tench\u2019s intent.\"\u2026 just the trick Jake would play on some highly respectable bigwig \u2026, send a bastard child to him with flowers when he was sick, but Jake would have to be might tipsy to play it on his own foster child and Portius. Why, he had threatened death on any who told Rosa that she was not his own, or so she heard.\"Sayward has to leave to tend Portius. She instructs Rosa to sit just inside the front door to wait. When Sayward returns, Rosa is gone. Her daughters Huldah and Libby are at the door.\u201c'Where is she?' she asked them.'Do you know who that was?\u201d Huldah leered at her.\u201cOf course I know. What did you do to her?\u2019'We didn\u2019t do anything,' Libby said. 'We just looked at her, that\u2019s all.' But her face said, 'We sent her home a flying.''I can imagine how you looked at her,' Sayward said sternly.\"This scene foreshadows Sayward\u2019s difficulty accepting Rosa\u2019s existence and the Wheeler children\u2019s and Porticus\u2019s rejection of Rosa throughout the novel. It also foreshadows Rosa\u2019s victimization by her mother, Jake Tench, and others in the community.By accident Chancey and Rosa meet in town. They discover that each feels estranged from their families. Rosa takes Chancey for walks in the woods to enjoy the beautiful isolation of nature that she craves. Chancey sees in her a sanctuary from his feelings of inadequacy and the resentment he feels toward his mother and siblings. They grow older, continue to meet; their meetings become know to their families; they are forbidden by them to meet. Portius has the sheriff warn Rosa and Chancey of the consequences of their continued meetings. After a subsequent meeting, Rosa\u2019s mother says awful things to her.\u201cDon\u2019t all right me, Miss Rosa! If you don\u2019t want to tell your own mother, I can\u2019t make you. But don\u2019t tell her either, when the law brings your sin out in court. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. Never did I dream I would have a daughter such as you!\u201dTheir meetings are not sexual, as the public and family members suspect. Each provides the other emotional release. Unlike Chancey, Rosa is a sympathetic, almost beloved character. We respond to her anguish when she looks through the windows of the Wheeler mansion and marvels at the advantages the Wheeler children have compared to what she must endure.\"Wasn\u2019t it the saddest thing in this world that you always had to be yourself, that you couldn\u2019t be somebody else, that never, never, never could you be the person you most wanted to be?\"I was furious at the outcome of her conflict.I valued also other aspects of this novel. For instance, the story, covering many years, mirrors real life. Tragedies occur, challenges must be met, characters age, children are born, \u201cprogress\u201d happens. At the end of the novel the town is nothing like what the land had been when Sayward, a child, was brought into the deep forest by her father and mother at the beginning of the novel \u201cThe Trees.\u201d All three of Conrad Richter\u2019s three novels about the Lucketts and Wheelers have an authentic feel about them that causes their readers to believe such a place existed.\ufeff"}, {"userName": "Sonia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3068937-sonia", "userReview": "Although Richter won the Pulitzer for this third book of The Awakening Land trilogy, it was my least favorite.

Conrad Richter has [had?] an amazing way of truly putting you in the setting of his books. The Trees were oppressive and dark, The Fields were bright but toilsome, while The Town is frivolous on the surface but dark in the underbelly. And the characters! While they were fun to read about in the proceeding books, they really came alive in this one. It was also refreshing to read a story that included a strong female main character. The argument between the young Wheelers and the old Wheelers about how hardwork and toil impacts a person\u2019s life was rather fascinating to read and think about [though it's rather clear what side the author was on ;) ].I highly recommend this one but only if you read the first two as they help set the stage.

Although Richter nicely involved the Reader in the 19th century changes of what was previously an Ohio wilderness, he resorted to quite a bit of moralizing when it came to character development. Sayward's beliefs and outlook are contrasted to that of her youngest child, Chancey, who is born delicate. He's contrary and lazy and challenges the notion that his Parents' (the pioneer's) generation are better people than the young because of their endurance of hardship, their work ethic and their humble view that events are in the hands of the \"Almighty\". For me, Richter over-sells this point. Sayward: \"If making your young ones work off their own troubles is old fashioned, and out of date, then the good Lord is out of date because that's the way He gives us troubles and then lets us sink or swim.\""}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david", "userReview": "The last book in the trilogy, this one was just heartbreaking.

At the moment, I don't feel I ever want to re-read this one, but I bet that will change and I'll feel the need to read it again, too. Not a big fan of the doomed romance part of the story, but it does give us some remarkable scenes. Otherwise, it is wonderful how recognizable the life of this family and this town is, despite being so far from my experience in years and circumstances.

It started out as a man vs. nature story about pioneers heading west into the Ohio territory immediately after the American revolution. They had to walk the long distance through wilderness; learn to coexist with or avoid the native Americans; and finally cut a homestead from the land that would sustain them. The story revolves mostly around the women's' stories of how they supported their men while raising their children and coping with heartaches live can throw at you. The series then morphs into the creation and maintenance of a society of like-minded pioneers. Their struggles of transforming from a hunting existence to a farming existence. Some pushed back against these changes while others took to the enormous tasks required to transform the wilderness. Finally the series explores the transformation of a small town into an important hub of commerce and politics. Along the way the story explores other dimensions of human existence such as: the effects of adultery on families; how people deal with inequality of wealth among neighbors; nostalgia for olden times by an older generation and the rebellion of younger people from their parents beliefs; the tendency of secrets to perniciously mold the lives of others and finally the difficulties children have with viewing their parents in an honest light.I only started reading these books because they are on a list I am trying to complete but I found myself pulled into the story completely from an early point. Many of the events portrayed remain with me in a visceral way. The main character Sayward is a truly a strong woman and should be a role model for people even today. She is forced from childhood at an early age and always relies on her strong moral compass to guide her through some difficult times. The arc of these books follows her from childhood into adulthood and finally old age."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1719430-jeff", "userReview": "The third book in Richter's trilogy about the early settlers in the Ohio valley follows Sayward Luckett Wheeler and her children as her homestead becomes a prosperous town. It is solid historical fiction exploring changes in people's lives as progress in the forms of canals and railroads are built and how separate generations adapt differently. The story tracks all of her children but focuses on her youngest and the tragic relationship he develops with a poor town girl. The depictions of Native Americans are troubling to someone reading in the present time. I also felt that more attention should have been paid to the growing divisions that ended in civil war. I wonder if these factors are what keeps this award winning series from being read more widely."}, {"userName": "JBresson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51578371-jbresson", "userReview": "\"Never did she believe in setting yourself up too high. Better keep your feet on the ground. Then you didn't have so far to fall, nor to get back up again. What's more, working for what you got kept your body stout and your mind sharp. But the main thing was that from down on the ground the whole world looked mortal fair above you. Bring your young ones up on top of the world, and they could only look down on the rest of us.\""}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8628327-wendy", "userReview": "For those interested in environmental history, especially forest history, Chapter 23, called \"The Trees\" is worth reading all by itself. The central character came of age during a time when European settlers often feared the giant, ancient trees they found in eastern North America. But within a single lifetime, this character realizes what has been lost and begins bringing trees back into what has become a city."}], "description": "Winner of Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, 1951 The Awakening Land trilogy traces the transformation of Ohio from wilderness to farmland to the site of modern industrial civilization, all in the lifetime of one character. The trilogy earned Richter immediate acclaim as a historical novelist. It includes The Trees (1940), The Fields (1946), and The Town (1950) and follows the Luckett family's migration from Pennsylvania to Southeastern Ohio. It starts when settler Sayward Luckett Wheeler becomes mother to her orphaned siblings on the frontier, and ends with the story of her youngest son Chancey, a journalist in the years before the Civil War. The Town won the 1951 Pulitzer Prize and received excellent reviews across the country.", "title": "The Town\n      \n          (The Awakening Land #3)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115468.The_Town", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1409413692l/115468.jpg", "reviews": 122, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8559.Conrad_Richter", "name": "Conrad Richter"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115468.The_Town", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6603080-the-town", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32713400-the-town", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/769000.The_Light_in_the_Forest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13760.The_Trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79275.The_Fields", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115482.The_Sea_Of_Grass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345396.The_Awakening_Land"]}
