Watching him walk away, blood running down his face, Kim knew she was in love. Of course, he had winked at her first. At least she liked to think he had. She\u2019d already decided he would be her next literary crush and any literary crush worth his weight in words would certainly wink at a pretty girl in a mini skirt. Wouldn\u2019t he? Perhaps not. Perhaps he\u2019s the strong silent type that draws women to him by ignoring them. Perhaps he pushed himself up on sore elbows, looked at her blankly - quite a seductive look itself on the right man - and walked away from the accident as if he weren\u2019t leaving disaster and confusion (including Kim\u2019s) in his wake. As if he hadn\u2019t been doing that very thing his entire life.None of that actually happened in the book. It DID happen in my head but then lots of things do. It could have happened. Richard de Nooy would have written it better, but it could have happened. That\u2019s one of my favorite things about this book. He leaves you to connect the dots yourself and to draw your own conclusions. There\u2019s room for your own imagination in the equation. And you will need it. It\u2019s a clever thing. The facts of the events are handed to you in a charming way as pages from a scrapbook, police records, textbook excerpts, letters, and sketches. But don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be easy.Tell the truth now. You wouldn\u2019t like it if it were. Would you?The events are thought-provoking. The characters, like your next door neighbor and the homely waitress who turned out to be a prostitute and the person who last e-mailed you, demand your attention in uncomfortable ways and require reassessment at every turn. I\u2019m still processing, still thinking about it, still unsure if I read it right, still going back to check. Like a detective who picks up a broken story three-quarters of the way through and begins to piece it back together at one end while it\u2019s still coming apart at the other. Yes, exactly like that.So you want a synopsis. Two brothers, Ace and Rem. South Africa to Amsterdam to South Africa, not necessarily in that order. Psychological issues - who doesn\u2019t have one or two? - are fascinating. It\u2019s dark and deep in places and light and fun in others. There\u2019s a cool orange chopper bike and Pacman makes a cameo appearance.I scanned the room, looking for a dark corner to bury my discomfort.And there they were, winking at me from a niche, two fruit machines, armless bandits, Fagin and the Artful Dodger. I walked over to the Dodger and dropped a coin into the slot. Warm water poured into my skull, instantly reducing my world to three whirring strips of fruit. Within seconds I was hooked. Just like I\u2019d been hooked on pinball, Space Invaders, Pacman and Asteroids. Just like I\u2019d been hooked on sports and games before that. Anything to narrow down the variables. Impose clear rules and odds. Distract myself. Focus. I spent about half an hour playing that first day, blew all my change and ate lukewarm snacks and soggy chips. But I knew I\u2019d be going back the next day.Not much has changed in the three weeks since the Dodger first slipped his artful hand in my pocket. Angelique still doesn\u2019t know my name; Rem is still beached on my bed upstairs; and I\u2019m down 430 guilders, which amounts to more than a full week\u2019s soul-snatching drudgery at Free University Lab Stores. But the oblivion it has brought me has been worth every fuckin\u2019 hard-earned cent. If ever there was a time I wanted to forget, this was it.That tells you nothing of the plot. I just liked it. I like the ease with which I slip into the story. Despite being American, despite having no clue what kleinkaasies are, I could relate. Say something scholarly about tone and characterization if you will. I was there. Given that I\u2019m a lazy reader (See the last two books I read. Oh that\u2019s right! I didn\u2019t finish them.), I take this to mean Richard de Nooy has written an excellently entertaining book."}, {"userName": "Kirk", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/667059-kirk", "userReview": "I owe Richard a big apology. I read Six Fang Marks back in September when we traded books and I've been as unprofessional as a comet-tailing hooker by not getting a review posted before now. I can only plead a busy life, which is a bullshit excuse because all I pretty much do is sit on my dimply ass all day reading books (okay, and grading papers, too). The reality is I needed time to digest this rollicking picaresque, which spans two continents, some graphic incontinence, at least two non-linear storylines, and a lot of comic mishaps and debiltating injuries. The forte is the style: it zooms more recklessly and disregardaciously than European traffic---and I mean that as a compliment. There's an attitude in the language that's loose, winky, and fun in its elbowing liveliness. The only word that comes to mind is verve. It's also a very male book, with a lot of boyish cock-woggling, which one expects from a coming-of-age story because, frankly, that's how we boys fumble our way to manhood: we cock-woggle. That's not to say that there's so much of what the French call le woggle du cock here that it will turn off distaff audiences (as witnessed by the many excellent comments here from GoodReaderettes). Then there's the structure, which is episodic, disconnected, flashing back and forth as it does between the sibling dependencies of two brothers and a journalist piecing together their story. I won't give away exactly how those tales are intertwined, but suffice it to say that it's sure to leave us Americans---literalists we are---scratching our heads, going, \"Huh?\" And that's a good thing: it's a reminder that not all stories need to be tidily told. I think what I liked best is how the novel drew me in wanting to find the connections in time and place between fragments and juxtapositions. It's no mean feat to construct a disjointed narrative that makes the reader want to joint it back together. That said, the book is also beyond smart in evoking the sentimentalities of brotherdom without getting too sentimental. In the end, all the indirection and uncertainty is a pretty neat metaphor for how circuitous the male syntax gets when trying to express something that should be as straightforward to parse as fraternal love."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/543625-valerie", "userReview": "When I first started reading this book, it reminded me of what it felt like to be ten again, riding my bike over a home-made jump with five friends lying down on the pavement in front of it, hoping I'd make it over. That's the kind of exuberance and recklessness I found in Rem, one of the two brothers that this novel is about. I rooted for Rem, and loved his fearlessness, purity, and loyalty. To me, he was the epitome of boundless and unstoppable youth. His brother, Ysbrand (more familiarly known as Ace) is the flip side of Rem's coin - more cautious, thoughtful, hesitant - but just as likely to get caught up in the thick of things as Rem. Six Fang Marks and a Tetanus Shot tells us the story of their lives, which are filled with and shaped by accidents - some minor, and some major - through Ace's recollections as well as that of a journalist trying to learn the truth.As I continued reading, the book gained much more depth. Without spoilers, things were revealed that made me reconsider what I'd already read, and see things in a new light. It's the kind of book that you keep thinking about after you're done reading it, and find yourself going back to in order to rifle through the pages one more time.Just sit back and hold on for the ride. It rockets all over - hilarious, tragic, poignant - but the more you read the more you'll want to find out where it's going. I'm looking forward to reading the next installment in what I understand will be a series."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/512643-michelle", "userReview": "This book is what I would imagine it would have been like to grow up as a boy with a younger brother rather than as a girl with a younger brother. Well, if both brothers were unnaturally accident-prone and/or possibly a bit insane. Maybe insane is too strong of a word. Was their story a result of some sort of psychological deficiency or just bad luck? In the case of Ace and his younger brother, Rem, I think it was just bad luck. Rotten luck.When I first started reading, I thought the narrator (Ace) was completely reliable. Then I started to have an inkling of doubt, which soon became full-blown mistrust, especially when another narrator was introduced. That\u2019s when I had a hard time putting the book down. I had to find out what happened. I had to find out the truth.At times hilarious, but more often tragic, loving, and poignant, Six Fang Marks & a Tetanus Shot was quite a ride. Besides the story itself, I also liked the not always linear scrapbook/diary format that the novel was written in. I enjoyed the flashbacks to all of the various incidents that occurred while the boys were growing up, and how they ultimately helped tie the novel together in the end. If you've ever known boys, particularly two brothers, a lot of those stories will sound familiar. The competition...the fighting...the loyalty...the love."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/520753-kim", "userReview": "I'm confused, but in a good way (yes, I believe that confusion can sometimes be beneficial). I think.... I don't know, give me a moment... Okay----I believe that-----wait, no, that's not right, hold on. This book... it ... um... hmm... isn't like anything I've ever read before (and don't go looking at my shelves and tsking my tastes)and that's cool, you know? Maybe not. I have lots of questions but I'm afraid to ask them, sort of equivalent to rubbernecking. Yeah, that's it. That's exactly it. I thoroughly enjoyed this, the set up was fantastic, the characters were fucking awesome and the story didn't follow any of my preconceived notions and I really really liked that (duh). Read the book already, okay? OH! I wanted to add one (one) of my favorite lines: Old age blows your appetite. It's hard to watch Death's twisted claws gripping that juicy peach and lifting it to your mouth."}, {"userName": "Maire Fisher", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/786135-maire-fisher", "userReview": "Six fang marks and a Tetanus Shot My son has read it, I\u2019ve read it, and my other son is about to read it.I wish he\u2019d hurry up, because then we could all have a proper discussion about it. So many things I want to ask them about, to see whether or not they agree with my take on things. Right down to the fact that I\u2019m still wondering whether Rem and dreams and nightmares and a sense of the surreal and Rapid Eye Movement are connected \u2013 and whether Ace is the wily one or the leader of the pack. (That\u2019s what this book does to you \u2013 honest.) The moment I finished Six fang marks and a Tetanus Shot I wanted to go back to the beginning and reassess everything that happened from there onwards. I wanted to tumble down those stairs again and try to figure out how many fang marks would be left by a certain number of dogs. I don\u2019t know exactly what happened, you see, but I\u2019m sure the pieces will slot into place better if I\u2019m wearing my Marple hat as I read. My son agrees. He also isn\u2019t exactly sure what happened. But the wonderful thing about wondering about this book and wandering about in it is that it doesn\u2019t leave us feeling frustrated. It\u2019s more a case of saying life\u2019s a bit like that. Nothing is cut and dried and people whom we thought we really liked can sometimes turn out to be completely different to what we thought them to be. But then, who are we to \u2018think them to be\u2019 in the first place? Do we have any right to demand that they behave according to our lights, or to be disappointed in them when they don\u2019t? That\u2019s in real life. Which is pretty confusing. In a novel like Six fang marks and a Tetanus Shot it\u2019s not much different. We invest in characters, believe them, think that if we\u2019re seeing things from their point of view, then seeing is believing. And just as we think we have a firm hold on things, it\u2019s quicksilver time and the slippery blighters leave us thinking \u2018whaaat?\u2019. (But never \u2018wtf?\u2019) I\u2019m going around in circles here \u2013 don\u2019t want to give too much away for those who haven\u2019t read 6fm. So no synopsis from me, and sadly, no clever and neat theories. Instead I\u2019ll just go back to page 2, to #1 ... That\u2019s when I can get my hands on it ...  ... So I\u2019ve just read this to my son and asked if he\u2019d add anything to what I (haven\u2019t) said and he said \u2018ummmm, I dunno, Mom. Maybe something about it being a really good book?\u2019 Which I was going to save for when my other son had read it and we could agree on one thing \u2013 that it\u2019s a fabulous book (in the true sense of the word), a puzzle, a labyrinth and a maze of a book \u2013 a treasure hunt and an obstacle race. Laugh out loud, gasp out loud book. A sick rollercoaster ride that swoops around the world and in and out of childhood. A black comedy and a slapstick pie in your face read. A bundle of truths, lies, evasions and confrontations. And it\u2019s a really good book (as award winning novels tend to be).PS - I can't leave this book be. Not without mentioning that even without all the ends being tied together, Ace left my skin crawling. I don't know if anyone else felt this way about him? I can't say why because then I'd have to tick the box that says this review contains spoilers."}, {"userName": "Kathe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/894851-kathe", "userReview": "Wow - this is a first novel? I loved it - I'll probably give it 5 stars after I re-read the whole thing. I'm a chain reader, and I usually have at least two going at once. Occasionally one captures my imagination and attention to the extent that I can't just finish it and go right on to the next; I need a day or two to ruminate. This was one of those rare books that not only keep my attention after I've closed the covers, but becomes better upon reflection.I have to admit that some of the dialect slowed me down a bit, but I'm sure that's due to my own inexperience. I was tempted to stop and look up braai and bakkie and terr, but I was more interested in what would come next. I probably read it too fast to pick up all the nuances, but I thoroughly appreciated the ironies and twists. As I got closer to the end, I thought I knew what was coming; I was almost right but still surprised. I knew I skimmed by something important in Deo's five chapters, so I specifically re-read them and was glad of it - there was more even than I thought I missed, and just that extra part of an hour made a great deal of difference.It reminded me somewhat of the experience of reading Life of Pi, but much more satisfyingly and less distastefully so. The strongest similarity is due to the lingering after-thoughts (post-musings?) similar to an \"aftertaste\" when eating...or maybe more like enjoying a fine wine? Great job, Richard!

Whiffs of Dostoevsky and Salinger and Martin Amis. This is an utterly unique book written by one of the freshest, brashest, rawest voices to come out of South Africa."}, {"userName": "Kaine Andrews", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13411533-kaine-andrews", "userReview": "I'm going to start off by saying this book is probably not for everyone. It's certainly bizarre, being composed primarily of stream-of-consciousness scribblings allegedly cribbed from the primary characters' journals mixed with a smattering of psychology textbook quotes, primarily on the subject of accident-prone and suicidal people. Untangling the central thread of the narrative is not for the faint of heart. Once you do however, there are some incredibly gut-wrenching nuggets of truth buried within that are - in my opinion, at least - well worth the price of admission.The central theme is the relationship between a pair of troubled brothers. Rem, an accident-prone, thrill-seeking borderline autistic (and potential psycho/sociopath) and Ace, a failed college student, lab worker and troublemaker who spends much of his time documenting his brother's insane antics and trying to clean up the messes. It comes off well, with the brothers and their relationship portrayed quite vividly and much more realistically than in most works; Ace and Rem may be dysfunctional, but they share a true bond and it's on great display, without getting into sappy After School Special territory nor swinging too far in the opposite direction of making them polarized reflections full of spite and venom.The technical aspects of the novel are solid, with the language being clear and well written - though a bit of a primer in Dutch and South African terminology would likely help the reader - in as much as it's supposed to be. Admittedly, there are points where the narrative becomes clear as mud, but in every one of those instances I felt as though that was the intention - and they were cleared up eventually - so I don't feel much need to dock it for those.Where the book really hits you, however, is the emotional component. After spending a bit of time setting up the weirdness of Rem and Ace's relationship, up to the point where you're probably casting Rem as the burly, slow, troublemaker and Ace as the shining knight who covers his brother's butt, you are treated to the blow by blow (via one character's recollections and a collection of police interviews) of what happened to a character who had often been referenced but never seen in the book previously. Those revelations - and their reverberations - shatter that initial painting of the characters, and do it extremely well. It's rare that something in a book comes out of left field (while still having all the seeds planted and ready for observation, had you but noticed...) and punches me in the gut, and this book did it three times. High marks on that count alone.The final few pages of the book, composed of correspondance and some extra scenes, was also very interesting... not sure if that correspondance was something the author actually engaged in when writing/publishing the book, or if it's more set dressing to \"sell\" the rest of the tale but in either case the inclusion was brilliant and intriguing. The extra sections didn't do much for me - I felt the tale as it had been told was fine enough - but were still of interest.Overall, I'd say it's certainly worth a look if you like strange psychological tales (especially in the Chuck P stripe, though this lacks much of the gore that the former is famous for), but should probably be avoided if you're of the tribe who prefers not to mix too much heavy thought into your reading. Excellent material."}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/418087-colleen", "userReview": "Dear Richardas promised I read your book while on holiday in Anysberg, a cape Nature Reserve, between Laingsburg and Ladismith. I also read Almost Moon by Alice Sebold as well as a number of children's books aloud to my 5 year old daughter.I was rivetted by your book, and devastated. I think it also had to do with being tired and the empty beauty of the landscape. I am left with questions - who is Deo? He is a tricky character, perhaps I didn't read closely enough, but he puzzled me.I like the whole sibling thing too, it's such a weird, ingewikkeld relationship, and you really give me (the reader) that.I also wondered why you chose to use all the different kinds of texts, they acted as distancing devices. Were you trying to keep us away a bit, keep our hands clean? Or yours? BTW - have you read that quote from Tobias Woolf, (In Pharaoh's Army) where he says - \"How do you tell a terrible story?\" How do you position yourself as the teller? In a way that is what I am left with after reading yours. OK, so this is a way to tell a terrible story. There are so many terrible stories and we are all implicated. You don't sidestep that... I don't think.I liked Ysbrand's voice and persona, although he is a bit of a wimp (like me). And shocking and surprising.I liked the linkd between past and present, here and there (Amsterdam). I grew up in Joburg, don't know Meredale well, but it was powerfully evocative. Your story left me feeling blue though. Does it always have to be so goddam awful.I couldn't put it down once I had started, which for me is the highest accolade, those are the books I love, not the ones that I know are good, brilliant, etc, but somehow I have to coax myself to finish. Not that I am saying the opposite re your book. But the best thing about it was - I was hooked,and surprised, and you left me guessing and wondering right to and beyond the end. I've been recommending it to people and I have bought a copy as a gift for a friend already.There is much more to say, but I don't want to rave on and I don't want to give the story away.warm regardsColleen"}, {"userName": "Chloe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe", "userReview": "This is a very interesting read from a first-time author. More of a scrapbook compilation of a story than a standard novel, the author moves through many different voices as he relates the story of Ace and Rem De Heer, two brothers growing up in South Africa. The brothers De Heer are plagued by accidents that variously incapacitate and harm them, related in short snapshots titled with the cause of the accident and the injuries sustained- from a jousting match with bamboo poles to impaling oneself on a car door handle. Woven among these stories is a mystery surrounding an event of their childhood that has far ranging consequences and haunts them into adulthood. When Rem shows up in Amsterdam and is subsequently smacked flat by a tram, Ace finds that the brothers' shared past of accidents and tragedy isn't as easy to leave behind as he'd thought.This is a story that teases you like a burlesque dancer, slowly dropping bits and pieces of its covering until the truth stands revealed. De Nooy's writing is quirky and written in a comfortable off-the-cuff manner that echoes the haphazard way his character's live their lives. His ability at writing dialect so that your mind hears it while reading is phenomenal. I particularly enjoyed a look at growing up in South Africa where the struggles of Apartheid were not the main focus, but rather events that intruded in upon the lives of the two brothers. I definitely look forward to the next work by this up-and-coming author."}, {"userName": "Brian Blankenship", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/432321-brian-blankenship", "userReview": "This is a strange book...but in a brilliantly pleasant way.

A puzzle that pulls you in and makes you wonder if this is indeed a work of fiction or an autobiographical confession. Great imagery, a feel for the grittiness of life, and a twisted sense of humor that is all too real in our modern world, utilized by people who often are just trying to survive it all.

Deze roman van de Zuid-Afrikaanse schrijver Richard de Nooy is alles behalve chiclit.De banaan slaat namelijk op de ongeluksmagneet Remco de Heer, waarover het boek gaat. Zijn broer, Ysbrand (Ace) beschrijft hoe zijn broer al van jongs af aan allerlei ongelukken en ongelukjes kreeg of zelfs veroorzaakte. Meestal zijn er wat butsen en builen te betreuren, maar een keer loopt het vreselijk uit de hand.Naast de belevenissen uit de jeugd in Zuid-Afrika van beide broers lees je in het tweede deel van het boek over een periode halverwege de jaren '80. Ace woont in Amsterdam en Rem komt hem daar 'opzoeken'. Natuurlijk krijgt hij ook daar een ongeluk: hij wordt aangereden door een tram en raakt verlamd vanaf zijn middel. Waarom wil hij toch geen hulp aanvaarden?Een roman die traag op gang komt - waar wil de schrijver nou naartoe met de beschrijving van weer een ongeval - maar aan het eind in een razend tempo naar een huiveringwekkende climax toe gaat."}, {"userName": "Shasta", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732050-shasta", "userReview": "From all the reviews I've read about this book, I am getting so antsy for it to arrive in my mail...it sounds absolutely amazing!!! 2 more days!!!"}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1386569-aaron", "userReview": "Boise library doesn't have this book, so I don't think I'll be reading this one."}, {"userName": "Tiah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/943435-tiah", "userReview": "Sick & Twisted w/ tight writing - Like it."}, {"userName": "Shelly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/583723-shelly", "userReview": "It hath arrived all new and sparkly... okay well maybe not sparkly but certainly new.
