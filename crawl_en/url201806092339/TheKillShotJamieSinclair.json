When her father, who is a retired two-star general, asks her for help, she agrees to help him. Little does she know that when she agrees, her lives, both her physical and love, will be in serious danger.I did not feel like I was reading a book but rather listening to a friend tell me a story. I do not know how the author did that, but the whole book felt personal and that is an awesome experience for a reader to have. The writing style flows smoothly and the book is an easy read. The author is very talented in creating tension and suspense with just the written word. I could not turn the pages fast enough to see what would happen next. There is more than one secret to unravel in this book and my attention never wavered. There are many twists and turns that had me second guessing throughout the entire book.The characters are well developed and three dimensional. Jamie is one tough woman and she knows how to take care of herself. But she also has a vulnerable side which made her seem more human to me. The way she tries to win her father\u2019s approval and her relationship woes made for some very touching moments. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well crafted mystery suspense with lots of twists and turns. This is the second book I have read by this author and I really liked them both. Do yourself a favor and check them out.I received a free copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for a honest review.

This is how the security specialist finds herself traveling to London to accompany a State Department courier tasked with delivering new passports to a Middle Eastern physicist and accompanying that person back to the United States. But things turn sour fast when Jamie and the courier are attacked as soon as they arrive in the UK. From there on, the job takes turn after turn for the worst and Jamie is stuck right in the middle. I didn't enjoy this follow up to The Kill List quite as much as Christoff's debut. I think it was moving Jamie from a domestic setting to an international one and throwing in more of a political spin that did it for me. Honestly, too, I felt she made some rookie mistakes in this one where she came across as a more serious professional in her first outing.The physicist in question will not leave the UK without their family, which throws a definite wrinkle in things when they're separated in the city. Multiple government entities are vying for this person and the information they can share, including the US.I did like the way Barrett comes back in the mix. I like him a lot but felt the added tension of Jamie's old school friend was a bit overblown for my taste. Oh, well. The Kill Shot is good for simple escapism, but I just didn't quite meet my expectations this go around."}, {"userName": "Linda Strong", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13684015-linda-strong", "userReview": "Jamie Sinclair is a security specialist.

I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. I have not read the first book in the series, although I would like to someday, but this one reads as a stand alone just fine. Jamie Sinclair is a security specialist who still wishes to garner her father's approval. So, when the powerful Senator asked Jamie for a favor you could have knocked her over with a feather. Naturally, despite her father's anemic displays of love or affection , she jumps at the chance to make him proud of her. So, she abandoned the one night she has with her boyfriend, Adam Barrett, a military police officer, in Washington for only a short time before he must leave on assignment, and heads off to catch a plane to London. Before it's all said and done Jamie will most likely regret ever accepting this assignment. A nuclear physicist and her father are in grave danger and nearly everyone wants them and their secrets as they become pawns in a deadly cat and mouse game and politics begins to take control over their safety as one double cross follows another. Jamie finds herself torn between her old friend Phillip and Adam, who has miraculously appeared in London as well. Not only that, it looks as if her father has thrown her under the bus and left her to either sink or swim. I understood what the author was going for here and it works pretty well much of the time, however, Jamie is in security and although she is working internationally, which could throw someone off their game, I still thought she was just too gullible. I could see it happening once, but on more than one occasion, Jamie took things at face value or trusted someone while I was screaming at her not to buy into it. Having said that, I found myself unable to stop reading the book, and kept picking it back up because was worried about Adam or Jamie or wondered what was going to happen next. The pacing was just about right and the characters were deliberately vague or murky because they all had their own hidden agendas. At times though the plot was just a little bit too transparent and I think some people who read a lot of suspense or thriller novels might groan or roll their eyes in some places. But, I do like to give thrillers a little benefit of the doubt when it comes to plausibility. As long as I was invested in the characters and I am being entertained, I'm not all that hard to please. I was not sure how to take the senator or Phillip though out the story. I was uneasy from the beginning and even less impressed by the end of the story. It does make for some interesting psychology between parent/ child and what we know deep down in our souls about someone, but are incapable of allowing that to penetrate our brains or hearts, or dwell on it for too long, because it is simply too painful. So, we continue to do whatever we think will get us that love and recognition we so desperately crave, no matter how old we are. I found this area of the book incredibly sad and Jamie's character is somewhat puzzling at times because she continues to allow some people in her life to have way too much control over her. I do hope Jamie will filter out the crap and stop allowing people to manipulate her like a puppet.  It does occur to me now that I don't recall a lot of unnecessary bad language or sexual content, it mostly stays on the innuendo side of things for those of you who take those things into consideration. I am glad I found this series and I liked this one well enough to try out any subsequent followups.  3.5 stars rounded to 4"}, {"userName": "Patrice", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4681894-patrice", "userReview": "I received a free electronic copy of this book from Net Galley/the publisher, for an honest review. This is the first story in the Jamie Sinclair series of mystery/intrigue books. I liked this introduction to the series. It is well written, the major characters are 3-dimensional, and the story flows. Jamie is a private investigator and security specialist and former Army brat. Her father, now a U.S. Senator, is also a 2-star General. Even though Jamie grew up on a number of army bases across the globe, she calls New Jersey home.(I think that\u2019s what makes me like her even more since I am a Jersey girl too!).It is an interesting story of a physicist from Iran wanting to leave that country and the Security Council for the U.S. is trying to get the doctor and their family safely to the U.S., enlisting the help of the British government (all hush-hush). Senator Sinclair asks Jamie, as a favor, to accompany Katie DeMarco (a State Dept. Courier) to London, to meet up with them and see them safely to the U.S. Simple, right? Nope. Immediately upon landing at Heathrow, the two women are attacked and the documents Katie carries are stolen. Thus begins their trials and tribulations throughout England. She meets her former college friend, Philip, now an up-and-coming member in the British intelligence agency.All-in-all this is a good story, not a lot of cursing and mostly innuendo with any attractions between the sexes. If I had to pick one thing that did bother me with the story, it has to be the fact that there were times in the story where I would have thought a security consultant would pick up on some important details, that I, as the reader picked up on right away. It seems she made some \u201crookie mistakes\u201d throughout the book. This did not detract from my enjoyment of the story."}, {"userName": "Darla", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11106985-darla", "userReview": "Really liked this one!!

I needed to get over my mad, because there were things that happened in this book that absolutely infuriated me. It says something that I got so involved with the character of Jamie Sinclair in the first book (The Kill List) that I wanted to grab her and shake her over some of her behavior in this book.The Kill Shot is certainly another wild ride for Jamie, and if you like thrillers with female protagonists the series is looking good.But some of Jamie\u2019s behavior in this book will make her friends want to sit her down for a good \u201ctalking to\u201d.The story is pretty straightforward. Jamie\u2019s father, the retired general and current senator, asks for Jamie\u2019s help. Because her dad never asks for help, Jamie is immediately onboard with the project.Dear Old Dad needs Jamie, in her role as expert security consultant and protective detail, to travel to London with a diplomatic courier and help the courier bring a famous physicist and their companion back to the U.S. using the U.S. passports that the courier has in a locked diplomatic pouch.Not only does this sound straightforward, but the courier is a friendly enough young woman that Jamie is more than willing to guard her. Nothing in this case is presented as remotely dangerous. And not a damn thing about it is even close to what it seems.There is a metric butt-load of danger, and every single person in the case is hiding an equivalent load of secrets.Oh, and Jamie\u2019s best friend and almost boyfriend from college is the British Foreign Office operative assigned to this case. He got himself into this mess in order to make one last play for Jamie. Or so he says.This operation is a complete clusterfuck, to put it lightly. Danger follows at every turn, and Jamie leaves a trail of bad guy dead bodies behind her. Some of those dead bodies are dead because Adam Barrett, the MP that Jamie got interested in while investigating in The Kill List, has followed her to London and is shooting some of the people who are after her. Dad may have said he needed her, but that doesn\u2019t mean he trusts her to get the job done. But then, Dear Old Dad knows a whole lot more about the job than he would ever tell Jamie.Of course, now some of the people after Jamie are after Adam. Even joining forces isn\u2019t enough to stop the carnage.Can they figure out who is behind it all before Jamie and everyone she is protecting gets killed? And even if they do, can Jamie ever figure out who she can trust when everyone (including and especially Dear Old Dad) is playing her?Escape Rating B-: Let me say this first; in The Kill List it seemed like every man Jamie met fell in love with her. Having one of her old besties start a hot and heavy pursuit did not help ameliorate this particular problem. That in this case the guy was at least half trying to distract Jamie from his downright skullduggery is only a slightly mitigating factor.For Jamie to be believable, the men in her stories need to stop the romantic attempts. Except Barrett. (My 2 cents)But speaking of believability, Jamie has a serious problem with her relationship with her father. It\u2019s not just that when he says \u201cjump\u201d\u201d she jumps first and asks \u201chow high?\u201d on the way up, it\u2019s that she knows he doesn\u2019t trust her, doesn\u2019t believe her and will use any ends to justify any means. It\u2019s that in this particular case she doesn\u2019t demand any of the information that she needs to do her job. If he were any other client, she would have made certain to get all the particulars of her duties before taking the job, because knowing what and where the danger might be is what keeps her alive as a security consultant.She also forgives him much too easily for leaving her out in the cold when the job turns ugly. His plausible deniability nearly gets her killed and nearly scuttles the mission she was sent on. If she was this sloppy all the time, she\u2019d have been killed long ago.Jamie needs some serious therapy to learn to deal with at least her reactions to her father if not with her father directly. He\u2019s going to get her killed if he keeps this up, and she\u2019s going to let him.The major reason that this mission \u201cgoes South\u201d repeatedly and often is that there is a traitor in their midst. Jamie is presented with clues multiple times that this is true and even the identity of the traitor, but she is too busy dealing with multiple firefights or their aftermath and many multiple instances of people lying to her and playing with her that she doesn\u2019t figure out the real problem until nearly too late.If this were a case she had acquired on her own, she would have done some due diligence which is totally lacking in this one.Jamie\u2019s actions in this case drove me crazy.On that other hand, the amount of danger and the sheer number of deadly situations that arise during this mission will keep the reader flipping pages fast until the very end. And the twist at the end is a dilly."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30751354-melinda", "userReview": "Visit The Discerning Reader for more reviews & giveawaysJamie is a likable character, a true professional, however, I am confident all the romance in both novels overshadows Jamie's full potential to the point where it solidly distracts. Given the seriousness of her assignment, she wasn't as sharp as she was previously. She seems overly preoccupied with both men's interests - Barrett and Philip, which is understandable to a degree. Her diversion conflicts with the impression she's created of herself with the reader, at least for this peruser.I would have preferred more action, thriller, mystery as opposed to yet again, hefty romance. Too much for my taste, a repeat of my issues with the first book. I would have preferred more development in the personalities of the two men in the quasi love triangle over the political hand.Jamie's distraction, the weighty political facet, the romance component deflected what could have been an even better narrative. I'm not opposed to my thriller/mystery containing romance, only a much smaller dose and less domineering. Showcase Jamie's smarts, professionalism, independence along with strength and a whole lot less amorous man hunting."}, {"userName": "Debbie Oxier", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21813445-debbie-oxier", "userReview": "Jamie Sinclair is back in another adventure. She is a private investigator. Her father is a formal general, now a United States Senator. Nothing Jamie has ever done has been good enough for the man but that doesn't stop her from trying to earn his approval. So when the Senator asks her for a favor she jumps at the chance to help. He wants her to escort a courier to London, make sure she arrives safely with the diplomatic pouch she's carrying, then return home. It sounds simple but as soon as she and Katie, the courier, arrive on British soil, they're attacked. From that point on they're in a fight for their lives. Jamie is surprised when Lieutenant Colonel Adam Barrett of the U. S. Army shows up at every turn. He and Jamie are attracted to one another but have yet to act on it. Things get even more complicated when an old flame from college is also on hand to supposedly aid Jamie in her quest. When the pouch the courier is carrying happens to be two passports for a physicist and her father then Jamie is tasked with protecting them from foreign operatives who either want to capture them or kill them for their knowledge regarding a nuclear threat. This adds to the suspense of the story and is the catalyst for a whole lot of action as Jamie and her party try to outrun their enemies.Another top notch story from this author. Her plots could be taken directly from the pages of modern day headlines, full of mystery and intrigue with a bit of espionage thrown in. I'm really enjoying this series. Jamie is tough, determined, and more than capable of taking on any case that comes her way. When she pairs off with Captain Barrett they make a formidable team and I'm looking forward to seeing where his relationship with Jamie is headed.

I simply didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as the first book in the series. In this one, Jamie allows herself to be so distracted by the men in her life that her supposed skills as a security expert seem to be almost non-existent! The fact that the reader can see her blatant mistakes and she cannot gets very annoying. Also, as a non-puritanical reader, I wish she would just get on with it and bed her man. The way that the author puts so many obstacles in the way, including numerous broken limbs, is irritating to say the least.

In fact, to me Nichole Christoff's sophomore outing read more like a spy novel. I was surprised by this shift in flavour to the narrative, though the general style of the book is very much the same as its predecessor. Jamie remains a kick-ass heroine and I really enjoyed reading about her next adventure.After \nThe Kill List\n, I was looking forward to learning more about certain secondary characters from the previous novel, such as Jamie's assistant Matty. Unfortunately, other than Barrett and Senator Sinclair the secondary characters from the previous book were largely missing from The Kill Shot. Instead, Jamie is enlisted by her father and sent on a mission to London, where we get to meet an entire new set of characters. My favourite of these was Ikaat \u00a0Oujdad, a young woman from an unnamed Middle Eastern country, who Jamie is supposed to help defect to the West with her father. I loved her spirit and her dreams; her joy at being able to do what she longs to do in peace and in the open, without fear of\u00a0reprisal\u00a0due to her gender, was lovely and was transmitted on the page very well.Ikaat's father Armand, was interesting too, but more in his role as Ikaat's father and as a figure who reinforces how people will do anything for those they love most, than in and of himself. That sense that people will do anything for those they hold most dear, be they a child, parent, spouse, potential partner, or friend, is I think the major theme of this book. It invades all the story lines and character arcs, from Armand and Ikaat, to Jamie accepting her mission for her father's sake, on to Barrett, and the other two new characters, the State Department Courier Katie DeMarco and British Foreign Office official Philip Spencer-Dean.While I enjoyed Katie as a character\u00a0\u2013 she had a great connection with Jamie \u2013\u00a0at the same time I found her storyline the weakest, as it felt somewhat predictable. On the other hand, Philip\u2019s arc didn\u2019t feel predictable at all, if you leave out the inevitable triangle with Jamie and Barrett. Philip is the suave, British gentleman, almost Bond-esque in ways\u00a0and he\u2019s the one that could have been the one in Jamie\u2019s past. The one who\u2019s such a close friend\u00a0that the risk of moving them out of the friend zone and having it fail is too painful to contemplate. While I liked the dynamics and chemistry between Jamie and Philip, I never felt as if it might truly happen, because as a reader I was already too heavily invested in Jamie/Barrett (should we call them Jarrett, is this a thing?) and additionally, I found Philip\u2019s behaviour towards Jamie almost bordering on the creepy, as he essentially doesn\u2019t take no for an answer\u00a0and keeps pushing the issue. And while there were some testosterone displays between the two men, Barrett seems far more\u00a0respectful of Jamie\u2019s capabilities and letting her decide for herself.If doing anything for those you love is a major theme in The Kill List, then Jamie\u2019s arc is a direct outflow from this. The only reason she takes on this mission is to gain her father\u2019s approval and it\u2019s his silence she feels most when in London. Yet while we learn more about the why of Jamie\u2019s daddy issues, we also get to see a softer side to Senator Sinclair, one that shows that the martinet has a softer heart than previously publicised. I also liked the other aspects of Jamie\u2019s character development, mostly focusing on her inability to fully trust anyone with her feelings, including herself and her fear of becoming involved with anyone to the point that they might hurt her. But she acknowledges to herself at least that one day she might want just such an attachment and she realises she\u2019ll need to grow to be able to do that, which I found interesting to see.In a way, The Kill Shot is typical for an on-going crime series, it\u2019s not so much about the cases as it is about the characters and in my opinion, Nichole Christoff writes her characters very well. I couldn\u2019t help but root for Jamie and Barrett, but I found myself caring about Katie and Ikaat as well. There is still much for Jamie to do and learn in her road to a happy ending, with or without Barrett, and I for one look forward to reading her journey and whatever scrapes and adventures she\u2019ll get into along the way.This book was provided for review by the publisher as part of a blog tour."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2021465-samantha", "userReview": "Summary from Goodreads:\"Jamie Sinclair\u2019s father has never asked her for a favor in her life.

(Page turning as in finger tapping since this was an e-read. LOL!) In all seriousness though, I had really high hopes for this book after enjoying the first book so much. This follow-up was just as fast paced and intense as the first book and I found myself having a hard time putting it down. What I love about this series is how this author includes details of military life within her books. Added to that was the fact that for the majority of this book Jamie is abroad in Europe. I absolutely loved all of the details that the author included to bring London to life. As I've never been, it was those details that really pulled me into this book and allowed for me to immerse myself within it. I could picture the different places that she was describing and it allowed for me to live a bit vicariously through Jamie and her adventures. What fun! This book was quite a ride and although I managed to figure out a few of the twists early on, for the most part I was kept in suspense which is just the way that I like it. I am very eager to continue on with this series and see what kind of trouble Jamie finds herself in next!My one and only complaint with this book is that I felt that Jamie missed a few important details that she shouldn't have. As a security consultant, I felt like there were a few irregularities (trying not to share spoilers here) that really she shouldn't have missed when she is supposed to be so good at her job. It didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book but I just felt that for her to be as good as she is portrayed to be....well, she should have caught on a bit faster to what was going on big picture wise. This is just my opinion though and I do realize that the fact that she didn't led to a more thrilling experience for me as the reader. So there is that. Just worth mentioning as it might bother others more than it bothered me.Overall this was a great reading experience for me, and one that I enjoyed from the first page to the last. I love how the author is able to create such a sense of place in her books so that I feel like I am experience everything right along with Jamie. I'm very eager to get my greedy hands on the third book as these books seem to be getting better and better. What kind of craziness will Jamie find herself in next? Who knows but I do know that I will be there to read about it! Easily recommended but especially to other mystery lovers. You don't have to read the first book before reading this one but I would recommend it just so that you get the full reading experience. Plus, you will understand more why I am such a huge Adam Barrett fan! Bottom Line: A nail bitingly good read!

This pulse-pounding second installment in the Jamie Sinclair series is a very absorbing novel with plenty of twists and turns that keep the pages turning at a blistering pace.Jamie Sinclair is thrilled and honored when her father, a retired Army officer and senator, entrusts her with a sensitive mission escorting a State Department courier from DC to Britain and back again. With little information about the assignment or much time to prepare, Jamie and Katie deMarco set off on their journey and upon landing, they are quickly besieged by an unknown assailant. Despite Jamie's best evasive maneuvers, the pair continue to be targeted by unknown attackers but help arrives from a very unexpected source, which just adds to Jamie's mounting confusion about her latest case. Stonewalled by her father's chief of staff, Jamie relies on old college friend Philip Spencer-Dean for assistance and when her suspicions about Lt. Colonel Adam Barrett's puzzling involvement are confirmed, Jamie utilizes his highly specialized skills as well. But, as Jamie soon discovers, the stakes are incredibly high in this extremely complex and dangerous game of political intrigue where nothing is at it appears.Jamie is still the same very capable and tremendously talented sleuth introduced in The Kill List but her strained relationship with her father hinders her case. She is extremely flattered by his faith her in ability to protect Katie, but Jamie soon realizes that his political agenda means he has not been completely honest about what awaits her in Britain. One of Jamie's strengths is her loyalty but this also becomes one of her greatest weaknesses where both her father and her old friend Spencer-Dean are concerned. There is enough double dealing and behind the scenes maneuvering going on that Jamie does not who to trust and she completely misses obvious clues that would have led her to the truth well before she found herself and those entrusted to her care involved in a number of life threatening and precarious situations.The Kill Shot is another high octane adventure starring the very intrepid and highly capable Jamie Sinclair. It is an exceptionally well-written and intriguing novel and Nichole Christoff once again mystifies readers with a series of clever misdirects and plot twists. Although this latest offering easily stands on its own, I highly recommend the entire Jamie Sinclair series to fans who enjoys mysteries with a strong female lead."}, {"userName": "Deb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090093-deb", "userReview": "Review Excerpt:There are many things I liked about The Kill Shot starting with Jamie herself--she is smart, driven, holds her own in a male-dominated career, and has a sense of humor. She's not perfect and has plenty of issues--some deeply buried and some readily apparent. I also like Barrett, who although strong and no-nonsense, also has a soft side and unlike her ex-husband and father, is pretty supportive of Jamie and her skills. I think the pacing of the book was good--I like a lot of action and tension in my mystery thrillers and The Kill Shot provided it. London is a vibrant and intense city and most of the action in this book was set there. Author Christoff did a great job of bringing the city to life.There were a few things in The Kill Shot that I disliked and that drove me a bit crazy. The first, for all of Jamie's reported skills as a security specialist, she seemed to lose a lot of ground in this second book. She made more mistakes than I would think someone with her experience would in keeping both herself and her clients safe and undetected, and she missed a whole lot of (pretty glaring in my opinion) clues. I like twists in my thrillers where I get at least a bit of a surprise at the end and while action-packed, this book did not have that. I spent at least half the book screaming at Jamie in my mind (OK, maybe a few times out loud too) about why she wasn't listening to/observing what was going on around her and without going into much plot-spoiling detail, who not to trust and who the 'bad guys' were. It just seemed pretty obvious. Overall I did actually enjoy both books--The Kill List, more than The Kill Shot as Jamie seemed more on her game in the first book. The writing and the combination of the mystery/spy/military angles held my interest and kept me turning the pages. I will definitely seek out the next book in the series with high hopes that the relationship with Jamie and Barrett progresses but that Jamie gets her head back in the game of security and crime solving. Probably 3.5 stars rounded down to 3 for me.

Full review, with excerpt(s)/quote(s) can be found at original posting:http://mnonmklreviews.blogspot.com/20...Stephanie Plum and Eve Dallas, meet Jamie Sinclaire.This book felt and read very much like the Plum and In Death series'. It was kind of an 'in the middle' type of read, maybe more In Death than Plum (in terms of serious versus comical). Jamie does protection/rescue detail, and at the urging of her father, she ends up in the UK. She is to keep a girl named Katie safe as she's traveling, more or less.Through the ins and outs of this story, you see Jamie doing what she does best -- protection, evade, escape. You see her battle emotions with a certain Adam Barrett, but then with her friend Philip. Barrett is Military Police and is out of the country often on assignment, and her friend Philip lives over in the UK. Nichole did a really great job of writing the suspense aspect. I liked watching Jamie battle with her emotions and desires -- she's a divorcee and is finding her way back in the emotional pool. However, the romance aspect is not the forefront of this novel....but being the reader that I am, those were the parts that kept me wanting more. I wanted to see more Barrett/Jamie interaction. I found that when they were together, everything was real and truthful. The touches, the comments, the looks. I just loved them together.I especially loved that in her world of men who keep things from her, regardless of her occupation, Barrett shared with her (what he could). Sure, parts of his job had to be kept under wraps, but when things concerned her or would somehow effect her, he didn't cajole, or hide, or lie... he told her.This was a story of twists and turns. The plot was always moving and keeping the reader on her (/his?) toes. But while, yes, there were more serious aspects than any other, I did enjoy the brief moments of comedy: \n[Barrett] \"You\u2019d better come see this.\u201dI wasn\u2019t going to come see anything. Not while I was stark naked and soaking wet.\nAt some point, Plum and Dallas fell off my radar. I'm going to make it a point to keep Jamie Sinclair on it."}, {"userName": "Dan Curnutt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1065879-dan-curnutt", "userReview": "I enjoy a good mystery, spy novel, military novel, Private Investigator novel and political thriller. This novel has the potential for all of that. It involves each aspect as much as possible and then they are woven together for a good read.I only had one small problem with the story; Jaime Sinclair is a Private Investigator, the daughter of a Military man and now a U.S. Senator. But franklin she left something to be desired in the investigative skill in this novel. Christoff writes the story with plenty of subterfuge and misdirection. There are plenty of characters who might be the bad guy or the good guy, but you aren\u2019t sure. But what bothered me was the fact that there were little things Jaime should have seen or recognized that would have lead her to a quicker resolution of the issue.Maybe she was too caught up in the relational/love angels that kept coming her way and they clouded her judgment, but her judgment was clouded and that shouldn\u2019t have really happened.So, with my frustration put aside (I figured things out long before Jaime) I tried to enjoy the story for the gist of what was happening. That I was able to do and enjoyed the writing. There are some other issues with how someone can infiltrate a secret military site, but that will be left for another discussion.Jaime Sinclair and Lt. Colonial Adam Barrett will be tasked with helping a defecting Dr. of Physics leave a Middle Eastern Country and defect to the U.S. They will do all in their power to make her transfer safe and easy, but the Middle Eastern country doesn\u2019t want to loose their prized physicists\u2019 and will do everything in their power to get her back.Then add the British to the mix and their desire to retain the good doctor for themselves and you have a three way circus of events that will keep the story moving, changing and rambling toward an end that will not make any of the three groups happy.I enjoyed Ms. Christoff\u2019s first book I read very much. I enjoyed this book as well, but not as much as the other. I think there are some small changes that would have made the story more believable and more exciting, but that is just me.Enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Dolly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4635876-dolly", "userReview": "3.5 Stars!Not exactly what I expected. I really enjoy thrillers and suspense novels and Kill Shot sounded like a good fit for me when I found it on NetGalley. What I didn't like: The purpose of the suspense novel to me is it keeps the reader guessing and Kill Shot fell somewhat short in that area. I'm not sure what Ms Christoff had in mind but it was almost as if she had a secret and couldn't keep it. The subtle clues about the antagonist were not subtle. I felt like I was being hit over the head with clues that said, \"look at me, look at me\". The synopsis indicates the heroine, Jamie Sinclair, is security specialist but again, this character seemed almost inept. She seems to be always reacting and not planning things out. She trusted people when she definitely shouldn't and didn't seem to be security conscious at all. I didn't find her to have any unique skills at all.I couldn't connect with any of the characters except one. Jamie's father came across more as a bully than a father. (My Dad spent a career in the military and the way the Senator is written just doesn't ring true).What I liked: The one character I liked and felt connected to is Jamie's maybe love interest, Adam Barrett. He was extremely capable and knew what he was doing. He wasn't necessarily reacting to the situations the group found themselves involved in. He planned and was more than a good judge of character. I know it sounds like I didn't enjoy Kill Shot but it did have some good parts. The author has an easy to read writing style. Her worldbuilding seems to be on point and characters are almost interesting. There were a couple of twists with one character that I didn't exactly see coming. This is the second book in the series and I didn't read the first, so maybe I missed something. While not a huge fan of this book, I might try something else by Ms Christoff down the road. I would recommend Kill Shot to readers who just might be dipping their toes into suspense/thriller novels. A veteran reader of those genres might not enjoy it very much."}, {"userName": "Annabel Krantz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4823894-annabel-krantz", "userReview": "A few months ago, I reviewed The Kill List, the first novel in the Jamie Sinclair series. I liked the feisty female security specialist with a take-no-prisoners attitude. The Kill Shot is the second book in the series, and Jamie returned in full force.The Kill Shot saw Jamie off-balance from the beginning. When her father, a hard-ass senator whose approval Jamie desperately desires, asks her to do a \u2018favour\u2019, she finds herself in London. What was supposed to be a basic security detail job turns into a race against time to keep a Middle Eastern defector safe from the political forces who want to see her dead \u2013 or kept alive to be used as a bargaining tool.I like political thrillers, so was familiar with the shady way that the players were conducting their business throughout this novel. However, there were times when Jamie, a professional, seemed a little behind the eight ball. Perhaps it was all the romance throwing her off balance\u2026While there were romantic undertones to the first book (the lovely Barrett was quite the charmer), in this book Barrett faced competition in the form of posh, gorgeous, cheeky Philip (who also was quite the charmer). With the two men vying for her attention, Jamie was at best a little distracted during her time in London. Understandable, I would have had trouble choosing between these two guys!! That said, there was a fair bit of focus on the romance in this book, perhaps at the detriment of the thriller aspect. However, it was well written, and kept me hooked\u2026 though perhaps a little more invested in the Barrett/Philip storyline than the political aspect!While I enjoyed this book, I must admit that I preferred the first book in the series. It seemed a little more focused, and the mystery was more developed. That said, I\u2019m partial to a little chick lit, and don\u2019t mind when romance pops up amid gunfire! This book is definitely still worth a read. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing where Christoff takes the character next!"}, {"userName": "Diane Coto", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15367113-diane-coto", "userReview": "This is the second in the Jamie Sinclair series. Her father, Senator James Sinclair (former Army Major General), is asking Jamie to accompany Katie DeMarco, a State Department Courier, to London. Jamie notices Katie is carrying a diplomatic pouch that exempts her from any search and seizure at the airport. In London, as they were making their way from the airport, someone grabs the pouch. But before they could take off, Jamie retrieves the pouch. Now it is torn and she can see it contains S Passports for people planning to defect. Katie finally explains it is for a physicist from a Middle Eastern rogue state who will trade secrets about a nuclear weapons program in exchange for asylum.Jamie is escorting Katie, the physicist and family when once again they are placed in danger. She ushers them into a bookstore and faces the man who then opens fire on one of her charges. But, someone takes him down before he can get a kill shot. Jamie thinks that someone looks an awful lot like her boyfriend and military police officer, Adam Barrett.The story is in Jamie\u2019s first person account. I love that she wears square rimmed glasses; I think it helps us realize she is more like us and not some super-model. She\u2019s portrayed at being very skilled and professional in her job, which is that of a PI and Security Specialist. However, I couldn\u2019t completely understand why she would have been asked to escort someone in an international situation. Once she realized Barrett was also in London on the same mission, she complained that her father did not trust her. However, after shots are fired, it is clear to me that her mission would have failed if not for Barrett. I think she made mistakes in judgment in this novel and I felt frustrated that she seemed na\u00efve about who to trust.

She continues to be a highly successful security consultant and private investigator and in this story she is given the task of escorting a US official to meet up with a nuclear scientist in London and then to bring them both safely back to the US. It seems like a straightforward mission - but, as in the earlier book, nothing is straightforward when Jamie is involved!The nuclear physicist turns out to be a young lady and that's just the first of the surprises in store for Jamie. In this story she renews her acquaintance with two possible love interests - Adam Barrett, the US Military policeman who was introduced to readers in book one, and an ex-college 'friend' Philip Spencer-Dean who works for the British Foreign Office. It seems the scientist is in demand, so much so that rival factions are out to get her to work for them, to kidnap or kill her - and Jamie is in the thick of it, again. Romantic opportunities will distract Jamie but there's so much double dealing and back stabbing going on that it is difficult for her to decide just who she should be able to trust! The mystery and intrigue which permeated the first story in this series is a key component in this one, too, making it another 'must read this to the end' book, one you don't want to put down till all is resolved.

Jamie is accompanying a diplomatic envoy on a mission to retrieve a defecting scientist. As soon as the plane touches down, the action takes off. Unfortunately, this assignment is even more dangerous than Jamie's last. As she works to get the scientist out of the country, she encounters not only danger but her old friend, Philip, who is a high ranking official in the British government. Philip and Jamie definitely have some chemistry, but to complicate matters, Jamie spots Adam apparently undercover in London as well. Philip and Adam both plant doubts about each other, but which one is manipulating her and which one just wants to keep her safe? I totally enjoy this series and these characters. Jamie can take care of herself and speaks her mind without being hard. The story had lots of action and plenty of twists to keep the reader guessing.
