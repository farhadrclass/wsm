It is a mixture of autobiography and folklore and is beautifully written. Maxine Hong Kingston received the National Book Award for this book in 1977 and remains a feminist activist.The book itself talks of the China of her parents (she was born in the US after her father emigrated in 1940) using the voice of her mother and herself as well as a mystical woman warrior. It is highly poetic at times such as when Maxine's grandmother (still in China) sends her sweet tastes telepathically, \"How large the world must be to make my grandmother only a taste by the time she reaches me.\" p.99The concept of identity pervades this work as Maxine's family is essentially country-less - the family in China is nearly wiped out by the revolution and their remaining property ceded to distant uncles that are still there and they fell isolated in the US surrounded by \"ghosts\" as they describe the white people around them. \"I could not understand 'I'. The Chinese 'I' has seven strokes, intricacies. How could the American 'I', assuredly wearing a hat like the Chinese, have only three strokes, the middle so straight?\" p. 166My favorite part was the second chapter \"White Tigers\" where she describes a great woman warrior is trained in combat from the age of 7 to 22 by two old peasants and goes on to lead a peasant army. It is highly inspirational to see such a strong female character. And when this is contrasted to the \"No Name Woman\" in chapter 1, one can understand why strong female role models and fables were so important to Maxine's self-esteem and sense of self-worth.I have visited China many times, but primarily the metropolises and my contacts with Chinese people have not been very deep. I was reminded of this by the scene in the last chapter \"A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe\" where Maxine is unable to get a word out of another girl who pretends to be mute except when she is reciting texts in class. I suppose that the cumulated suffering destroys one's voice as one feels powerless that even speech is too difficult. I did have one encounter years ago when I had dinner in Taiwan with a Chinese colleague whose family had fled with Chang Kai-Shek to Taiwan following Mao's victory in the Chinese Civil War. He tearfully described to me how his parents who were university professors had destroyed their fingers and backs digging trenches bare-handed during the Cultural Revolution. It was the rare moment when a Chinese person opened up to me about his suffering. And yet, that also bears some ambiguity because as bad was the Cultural Revolution was, before that, Mao had banned foot-binding (described several times in The Woman Warrior): \"Nobody wrote to tell us that Mao himself had been matched to an older girl when he was a child and that he was freeing women from prisons, where they had been put for refusing the businessmen their parents had picked as husbands. Nobody told us that the Revolution (the Liberation) was against girl slavery and girl infanticide (a village-wide party if it's a boy). Girls would no longer have to kill themselves rathe than get married. May the Communists light up the house on a girl's birthday.\" p. 191. So as everything in history, there are great ambiguities surrounding Mao. This reminds me of the condemnation of Castro for his imprisoning of land-owners and homosexuals (all true) but the relative ignorance of the improvements in education and medicine (the best teams of doctors in any international crisis are bound to have a Cuban or more in them.) Such is life I suppose.The Warrior Woman is a provocative and challenging voyage into Maxine Hong Kingston's life and dreams as a Chinese woman and remains a great piece of literature 40 years later."}, {"userName": "L", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1293927-l", "userReview": "Probably most intriguing about the structure of Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s Woman Warrior, beginning with \"No Name Woman\u201d and ending in A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe,\u201d is that it characterizes Maxine Hong Kingston\u2019s memoir, told in the interesting format of non-sequential episodes, as one that begins in oppressed silence but ends in universal song. When looking at the three woman warrior figures in the book \u2013 her aunt, the No Name Woman; the rewritten legendary warrior in \u201cWhite Tigers\u201d (based upon the Mulan legend); and the poet and barbarian captive, Ts\u2019ai Yen \u2013 the characteristics that unite them all are their determined attempts at asserting their own kinds of power, femininity, and individuality in patriarchal Chinese society. The methods through which they do so revolve around words written, spoken, or not spoken: from the silence practiced by No Name Woman, to the words written on the warrior\u2019s back, to the songs created by Ts\u2019ai Yen and, finally, to the stories that Kingston as the author uses to find the marks of the woman warrior within herself, and to do so in a way that allows the readers insight into a life that even the narrator is grappling to understand. The words that open Woman Warrior, which begins with the story of No Name Woman, are quite interestingly an admonition of silence: \u201c\u2019You must not tell anyone,\u2019 my mother said, \u2018what I am about to tell you\u2019\u201d (3). This admonition signifies a promise, and a breaking of a promise: The narrator\u2019s mother Brave Orchid is showing courage and confidence in her daughter by sharing something that should not be remembered, yet at the same time, her mother is breaking the silence surrounding her sister-in-law, the titled No Name Woman. This is one of the first of many of the narrator\u2019s mother\u2019s talk-stories, ones that were told with a purpose to aid her children in life events, while sealing the bond between child and mother. The story of the woman warrior, who is the protagonist of \u201cWhite Tigers,\u201d is created in history and then transformed by the narrator into one of triumph through the breaking of silences. Inspired by Kingston\u2019s childhood and the stories of Yue Fei and Mulan, the chapter becomes another way for the narrator to celebrate the breaking of silences, something that continues throughout the book. This union between mother and daughter the novel can be seen as the compromise of generations, an idea carried out in Kingston\u2019s appropriation of myths and stories seen in the retelling of these woman warriors. Her mother, in fact, is the narrator\u2019s guide of the methods in which to appropriate talk-stories for her own purposes. Kingston\u2019s retellings are part of the idea that a culture growing up in one country can appropriate the lessons of their parents, who grew up in another. It is the idea and the hope that stories created by a patriarchal culture can still make room for its daughters, ultimately one the most important ideas Kingston communicates in her beautifully rendered book."}, {"userName": "Nicole~", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20071931-nicole", "userReview": "4.5 starsThe Swordswoman of WordsThe Woman Warrior is Maxine Hong Kingston's own story of growing up Chinese-American, an irreconcilable position for her as the two cultures would seemingly clash, unable to provide her with a stable sense of identity. She grew up confused by the ideas and behavior of her parents and the villagers who had settled in Stockton, California, who saw their American-born children as very strange - not really Chinese. Her parents hoped one day to return the whole family to China - yet the China they had left had since changed. All she knew of the place she had never been, was through the 'talk-stories' told by her mother; parables in the Chinese tradition of telling magical stories and incorporating them into their everyday life; of ancestors and relatives, and great tales of mythic and cultural heroines. Her mother was exceedingly gifted in talking-story:\nNight after night my mother would talk-story until we fell asleep. I couldn't tell where the stories left off and the dreams began, her voice the voice of heroines in my sleep. And on Sundays, from noon to midnight, we went to movies at the Confucius Church. We saw swordswomen jump over houses from a standstill; they didn't even need a running start.At last I saw I too had been in the presence of great power, my mother talking- story. After I grew up, I heard the chant of Fa Mu Lan, the girl who took her father's place in battle. I had forgotten this chant...given me by my mother, who may not have known its power to remind. She said I would grow up a wife and a slave, but she taught me the song of the warrior woman, Fa Mu Lan. I would have to grow up a warrior woman.\nIn The Woman Warrior, MHK constructs her own identity and the meaning of her life. She places herself as the primary narrator in stories artistically woven with Chinese myth and legend, including other women characters- some known and unknown, real and imagined. The stories are highly imaginative; the narrative flows with wondrous elements of magical-realism. The book is sectioned into five chapters, illustrating MHK's American experience: \nNo Name Woman\n tells the story of her aunt who was ostracized for having an illegitimate child; \nWhite Tigers\n weaves the story of Fa Mu Lan- the mythical character to whom MHK most relates- who goes to battle in her father's stead and saves a village; \nShaman\n tells the story of her mother, Brave Orchid, becoming a doctor in the old country and her immigration to America; \nAt The Western Palace\n covers her mother's sister, Moon Orchid, in her journey to California in the hope of reconciling with her estranged husband; \nA Song for A Barbarian Reed Pipe\n reflects a poignant message of preservation of an ebbing culture and a melding of the current ones.MHK would often rebel against the stringent Chinese-feminine model: \"I refused to cook. When I had to wash dishes, I would crack one or two. 'Bad girl,' my mother yelled, and sometimes that made me gloat rather than cry. Isn't a bad girl almost a boy?\" She knew that she must become a warrior woman- strong, independent, a fighter, a burden to no one, she won't be silenced. She confessed to her mother that she, too, could 'talk-story'; and how immeasurably gifted she was at that!Her power was wielded in language, her 'loosened tongue', her voice; her sharpened pen became her sword, her strength.In an interview in the Atlantis publication jun-nov 1988, Maxine Hong Kingston explained that she took care to find the force of reason within her stories, the middle ground between the real world and the supernatural. 'The Woman Warrior' was a vehicle for the many voices MHK heard within herself. She hoped that her writings would give a voice to Chinese-American women, and that their everyday existence growing up in America within a traditional Chinese culture, would be seen with more compassion and understanding, with a bright look toward a balanced resolution. For MHK herself, The Woman Warrior finally reconciled those clashes of the two cultures, to the formation of a beautiful, enduring, identifiable new one.First read January 2009"}, {"userName": "Zanna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna", "userReview": "I'm writing this review up from my notes unfortunately, as I read it when I was too busy to sit down and type. It's one of the best memoirs I've ever read, marked by sensitivity, sorrow, unresolvable conflict transformed into a breathtaking work of art, an epic canvas unrolling intricacies and intimacies that made me miss my tube stop, get the wrong train, mix up bus routes, so absorbed was I by the character of Brave Orchid, the narrator's mother. This woman she admires and fears and at times feels rejected and hated by, whose behaviour is a mystery to her because she refuses to explain anything, seems to expect her to raise herself Chinese in barbarian America, a land of ghosts. I felt the desire the narrator had to accomplish this feat, her frustration at falling short of performing the impossible taskThis is a feminist text. It opens with a story, told by mother to daughter as a cautionary tale against promiscuity (or rather, the transgression of sexual boundaries) about the death of a female relative. The narrator, given only the bones of this story and perhaps haunted by it, has to imagine the details, and does so repeatedly, reorienting them each time to fit different perspectives. first, she rehabilitates her kinswoman's reputation by imagining her raped, blameless, caught in the fatal web of an intensely masculinist society. Second, she breathes life back into her by constructing a romance in which star crossed love comes to grief. Finally, she reviews the situation from the perspective of the villagers and family, delicately explaining their actions with chiaroscuro. And throughout each of these retellings, she integrates the effect the story had on her life in the USA, the way it changed how she thought about others' views of her and how she tried to behave socially. The result is a braided story that binds women's lives across time and culture, a half-tested guide-rope though hostile environments. A rope is many things, among them both saviour and weapon against oneself as well as others.Rage at the position of girls is worked into wish fulfilling self-mythologising in the delicate and poetic yet fierce story 'White Tigers', in which the narrator fantasises about doing what she imagines a girl must do to be valued. Tellingly this includes assuming a male disguise, but remaining a woman 'Marriage and childbirth strengthen the swordswoman, who is not a maid like Joan of Arc'. This protest story is a self-made talisman for the narrator, and it reflects images of Chinese culture that heal and sustain her, suppressing the words that chafe and damage. She makes her own empowerment by rooting down into her heritage, not by rejecting it. Parallel to this self-care project of making images she can inhabit and revision herself through, run the narratives through which she constructs her mother's humanity and inner life, gradually building images of her she can make sense of and feel for. Once again, to me these vignettes illuminate an unfamiliar style of being, yet one I can appreciate and respect: 'the sweat of hard work is not to be displayed. It is much more graceful to appear favoured by the gods'. Thus the narrator makes sense of her mother's secret night studying at medical school, covering the tracks of her path to shining success.At times it was almost unbearable to read the things said about girl-children (vermin in rice, for instance) as an adult woman, but the narrator was recalling hearing them as a child. The little warrior screams in protest, throws tantrums uncontained, paints everything black, refuses for years to speak. How did Chinese girls in China avoid such anguish, if they did? What did they learn that protected them? Or what, on the other hand, made the narrator vulnerable among ghosts to the rage and misery such hatred called forth from her? I remembered the miscommunications of The Joy Luck Club, and how lucid Tan made them by working both sides, playing out all the angles as omniscient author, comforting me with the reassurance that however differently, conflictedly and incommunicably, mothers and daughters loved each other. Kingston offers no such clarity. We have the narrator's feelings and her glorious, multivalent fantasies of her mother's inner life, her therapeutic self-mythologising, a patchy, lumpen blending of ways of being and knowing than opens doors and hearts, names spirits, recounts mysteries, but maintains, I felt, a kind of respectful refusal to assume. If Tan's edges cut cleanly, Kingston's are left rough. They scrape and hurt: something is catastrophically lost between China and the ghost country, the possibility of wholeness has fallen into the sea and sunk to the bottom. I gave The Joy Luck Club five stars, but Kingston's rejection of omniscience in this book makes its approach, to me, more... ethical, more admirable. The honesty and care the narrator employs is humbling. she conceives of her need for explanation for her mother's careful keeping of tradition as pouring concrete over a forest, killing the subtlety and cleverness of Chinese communication styles and life, even though it's her earnest desire, and blameless, surely, even admirable, because she is willing to become the carrier of tradition but it denied the opportunity. Yet her mother cannot shoulder the blame either; explanation is not the mode of conveyance needed, only the osmosis possible in immersion could educate the wayward daughter. Locked in the paths or poses of their unanswerable desires, mother and daughter carve their shapes into each other by attrition as they are rocked and rolled by USian waves. There is no resolution, only the story and its scarred traces."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/760355-mary", "userReview": "I think I read almost this entire book with my jaw dropped. Maxine Hong Kingston has an incredible ability to say so much, so brilliantly, within every single phrase. The structure of her memoir speaks to all three of her identifications - Chinese/ American/ Woman - merging fiction with non-fiction and her own story with those of relatives and mythic heroines, to create a piece that represents her own immersion in a culture far better than a more traditional autobiography or memoir ever could.

Ought to write up a thinky review, with lots of discussion of representation and acknowledgment that it's unfair to expect every Chinese-American writer to describe the entire Chinese(-American) experience, but I am too lazy to do that right now. I think most of my issues with this book would've been solved if Hong Kingston stopped saying \"Chinese blah blah blah\", as if all Chinese people were one great homogeneous block and did the same thing, all the time and everywhere. (She kind of acknowledges this issue, in that she is like, I don't know what about me is Chinese and what is from my family and what is from the village etc. etc., but she then proceeds not to do anything about it.)Also that kind of very deep ambivalence about being Chinese/Chinese culture is quite strange to me, so it kind of put me off.

I know an author has creative license, especially with a memoir, but the realistic chapters placed next to fantasy ones made the book too disjointed for me and I couldn't get into it. It didn't challenge my thoughts of what a memoir is, I liked the fact that she incorporated dreams from her childhood (I'm assuming) as reality when describing her childhood, because I remember how real my dreams and games and wishes seemed to me as a child. But this was hard for me to read because I really was expecting to read something coherent. And her fantasy sequence bored me. I much more enjoyed the realism.

Fascinating to reread a book so bold and new in form and content when it was first published in 1976, a moment women authors and women's' experiences were finally being viewed with serious interest in America, and see how familiar and understandable it is now, when once it had seemed so jagged and unfamiliar and yes, exotic.

Even though I was maybe 8, I got to be in on it because we were playing teams. Then I noticed the box stated the game was actually for ages \"12 and up\"--or whatever the number was--point is, I was below it. As a kid I believed this written statement to be LAW, and breaking the law was the worst thing you could do. I seem to remember bringing up my legal concerns and being unsatisfactorily brushed off. I was definitely confused why my family would encourage me to break a law, but mostly I was just scared. The whole game was spent apprehensively looking out the window for approaching police cars on the prowl for illegal child gaming. At some later age, of course, I understood the point of those age recommendations. My family had deemed me old enough to sit still and show more interest in trying to answer questions than eating the plastic pie wedges. That was the end of thinking about it for them, while I sweated out the game swamped in guilt and fear. Everyone has lots of stories like this. Kids are strange unfinished creatures with bizarre impartial understanding of the world. I understood the mechanics of a trivia game but was completely mystified by the nuances of printed rules.The Woman Warrior is Kingston's version of these kinds of stories, only the subtext is much more complicated and the fears much less trivial (wow did I not plan to set up that pun, but Zing!!). She grew up in the U.S., born to a Chinese immigrant family, worked in her family's laundry, and attended both American and Chinese schools. Her stories waft between facts, hearsay, and Chinese mythology to show how all her experiences growing up are filtered through two cultures, without her really understanding either until she was older.

This book starts out conglomerating Chinese culture and people and ends in a similar fashion. If colleges really want to teach about Asian-American or Chinese cultures and life, I don't understand why they'd pick a memoir so boring and stereotypical. Kingston does not know how to transition from one event to the next. Many paragraphs and scenes in this book are poorly constructed and executed, bouncing back and forth like a jump-cutting B-movie. Kingston's voice sounds forced and lifeless, which is unfortunate, as this memoir sounded very promising.This book fits colleges very well: It's politically correct to a point where it seeps off the pages in mass doses, the author's voice rings of one you'd hear from an NPR host, it talks about horrendous and perverse comportments in a tone so dull it's almost insulting, and the book just reeks of a holier-than-thou attitude that is common in college-assigned memoirs.I picked up this book myself, not have it assigned to me. I knew nothing about it being popular in colleges until I finished it a 2nd time (and severely disliked it).

The book blurred the line between memoir and fiction for me, but in a good way.  I have to say, I found the fiction parts more interesting. I thought it was fascinating to hear about the \"Chinese half\" of Maxing Hong-Kingston and the way she told these imaginative stories using figurative language. I also liked the way the author challenges traditional gender roles in the Chinese culture and empowers women through her vignettes."}, {"userName": "Pink", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink", "userReview": "I'm not sure that I've read anything quite like this book before. A collection of five stories, memoirs, woven with Chinese folktales and all slightly different in their construction. I can see why it doesn't quite fit into a specific genre. I'd never heard of Maxine Hong Kingston until recently and although I think this text is taught text in America, I don't think it's well known in England. I'm really glad that I discovered it though, as I was mesmerised by the different stories, learning about Maxine, her family, their lives in America as well as their earlier history in China. Beautifully written and captivating to the end."}, {"userName": "TheSkepticalReader", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-theskepticalreader", "userReview": "After experiencing Kingston\u2019s writing in China Men two months back, when I saw the opportunity to read The Woman Warrior next, I was excited to begin reading. The premise of China Men didn\u2019t appeal to me as much and, perhaps because of that, it was slightly boring for me, but The Woman Warrior was a much better read now that I knew what to expect from Kingston.The Woman Warrior does what China Men did best, which is to blend and fuse fact with fiction with an expertise I\u2019ve only experienced in Kingston\u2019s novels. While the effect of her writing is not as potent as it was in China Men, I still loved her for breathing fiction into reality. It just makes for a better reading experience, it makes reality better.Another aspect I thought was enjoyable was the intertextuality of the memoir. At several points in this book, we get to see her refer to characters we\u2019ve already met in China Men and I felt more comfortable to have already been familiar with some of Kingston\u2019s other relatives; to have already read some of their stories in China Men. I\u2019m not sure which one was meant to be read first in this case, but I felt more comfortable with Kingston\u2019s storytelling having already known her as a novelist.What I was uncomfortable with in this book, though, are her assumptions about Chinese as a whole despite herself having only half a Chinese experience. As someone who was born in India but raised in America, while I do (unfortunately) have to lump together a lot of assumptions about Indians via my own experiences, I do comprehend that not all Indians are the same and I cannot judge one person based on my conversations with another. At times Kingston, maybe simply for convenience, merges all Chinese together with certain attributes and I\u2019m a bit doubtful of this approach. Is she simply assuming we\u2019ll know better even though she doesn\u2019t explicitly say so? Or is she really merging all Chinese together based on her own experiences (good or bad)?This is something that keeps me thinking because at times, her \u201cmoral of the story\u201d is clearly illustrating how we often forget about the places we come from and why there\u2019s a problem with this, but then in other moments, she just outright says something along the lines of \u201cChinese men\u2026Chinese women\u2026Chinese schools\u2026\u201d and a lot of generalizing occurs here. I noticed she also did this a bit in China Men and I\u2019m aware that she\u2019s also been accused of rewriting Chinese mythology without ever having gone to China in the first place. While I can see why she plays with certain elements and stereotypes in China Men, since it\u2019s tagged as mostly fictional, in The Woman Warrior however\u2014a memoir, or so it is labeled\u2014, it\u2019s a bit unsettling.Regardless I can\u2019t say this was not an enjoyable read. I would recommend it if you want to learn a bit more about the Chinese-American experience in an impressive writing style."}, {"userName": "Lena Lang", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2783488-lena-lang", "userReview": "I quite liked this book. The writing was beautifully descritive and fitted well with the overall theme of the book. I think it really conveyed the Chinese American experience in that it showed a world where people are trying to make their way in a new world while still tethered to tradition. I also really enjoyed the way the concept of tradition was handled. On the one hand, Hong describes the all reaching confucian patriarchy that shaped women's lives in China. The way female infanticide, lack of formal education, foot binding, early marriage, rigid social norms played out in lives in China certainly limited the options of women yet they are portrayed as the title of the book suggests, warriors. They rarely give in to their fate and continue to eke out spaces for personal fulfillment. It plays into the idea that culture is not a monolith but rather contains many traditions, many voices. On the one hand the Chinese Hong describes expect women to be timid, obey their elders and defer to males, on the other the oral tradition indicates that women could also be brave, strong and loyal to justice in a way not officially acknowledged in teh day to day. As an immigrant myself, I always marvel at the way fellow newcomers eke out an identity amid binary cultural scripts. I think this book offers a really good description of the experience of being confronted with such choices."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5629372-margaret", "userReview": "The Woman Warrior combines Kingston's memoir of growing up in the U.S. the daughter of Chinese immigrants, her mother's story, and Chinese folklore and history. My favorite chapter, \"Shaman,\" tells the history of how her mother became a doctor of midwifery in China, and battled ghosts in a woman's dormitory. It was hard to relate this independent ghost-fighting doctor with the mother Kingston describes, who belittled her daughters, though she's a warrior throughout. Both Kingston and her mother are warriors, in very similar ways though they never see the similarities in one another.While I enjoyed this memoir, there were moments when it felt like Kingston was using her life to stand-in for the entire Chinese immigrant experience, and those generalities made me uneasy. One lived experience can give insight into a culture, sure, but it can't be the model for a group, if that makes sense. The memoir was best when it was specific to Kingston's personal experience, weakest when she related her experience to all Chinese immigrants."}, {"userName": "Mel Gonz\u00e1lez", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20786771-mel-gonz-lez", "userReview": "\u201cI learned to make my mind large, as the universe is large, so that there is room for paradoxes.\u201d\nThis was very very instructive, I can't tell you how many things I've learned about Chinese culture, myths and legends. Loved the parallel between fiction/non fiction. It's definitely a super important feminist book you should read to understand the world a bit more and to expand your mind on these things. It's a book about constructing identities and figuring out what things you want to take with you into your life and what things you are leaving behind. The narrative is very beautiful, with an amazing flow and the stories and the way they are told are really imaginative and unique. My only problem is that I wasn't invested in any of the stories nor the main character. I realised that I was reading them only to know more, not because I was really interested in what was happening or because I cared for them. It is an empowering book with an important message and a big discussion on representation and diversity, but it just wasn't for me."}, {"userName": "Rachel Louise Atkin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15238324-rachel-louise-atkin", "userReview": "Read for uni.

Maxine Hong Kingston ( \n   Review \n  Maxine Hong Kingston grew up in two worlds. There was \"solid America,\" the place her parents emigrated to, and the China of her mother's \"talk-stories.\" In talk-stories women were warriors and her mother was still a doctor in China who could cure the sick and scare away ghosts, not a harried and frustrated woman running a stifling laundromat in California. But what is story and what is truth? In China, a ghost is a supernatural being; in America it is anyone who is not Chinese. In addition, underlying even the most exciting talk-stories of Chinese women warriors is the real oppression of Chinese women: \"There is a Chinese word for the female 'I' - which is 'slave.' \" In an attempt to figure out her world, Maxine Hong Kingston finds herself creating stories of her own, filling in the blanks her mother has not told her because her daughter is, after all, not true Chinese and thus cannot be completely trusted. Can these new stories explain why she had trouble speaking in the American schools? Can they help her understand the aunt who committed adultery and whose existence is denied? The new stories refuse to fall into traditional forms, and the realizations that come from them often bring out a beautiful, passionate anger that practically burns through the pages. This is powerful, experimental writing, a combination of love, hate, frustration, and sheer beauty. -- For great reviews of books for girls, check out . -- From"}], "description": "A Chinese American woman tells of the Chinese myths, family stories and events of her California childhood that have shaped her identity.", "title": "The Woman Warrior", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9287381-the-woman-warrior", "average": 3.72, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328356049l/9287381.jpg", "reviews": 1204, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17290.Maxine_Hong_Kingston", "name": "Maxine Hong Kingston"}], "type": ["Autobiography", "Nonfiction", "Feminism", "Cultural", "Classics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9287381-the-woman-warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31696614-the-woman-warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30852.The_Woman_Warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52324.The_Woman_Warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25087950-the-woman-warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22698820-the-woman-warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6633408-the-woman-warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58304.The_Woman_Warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25534223-the-woman-warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148787.The_Woman_Warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9502994-the-woman-warrior", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129911.China_Men", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85651.Tripmaster_Monkey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222438.The_Fifth_Book_Of_Peace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9471417-i-love-a-broad-margin-to-my-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129912.The_Woman_Warrior_China_Men"]}
