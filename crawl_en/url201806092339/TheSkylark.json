While the center of the book is a fascinating, prolonged examination of the blossoming of a sociopathic personality (and was later extracted whole by Straub and published as the novella \"A Special Place\"), the book overall is a much more loosely plotted affair, where the pages alternate between indulgent and meandering episodes and gripping examinations of the effect of a traumatic supernatural event on the lives of a collection of friends and acquaintances. This book is an earlier, \"much looser, sloppier, more wild-eyed version\" (Straub's own description) of a novel he published in 2001 called \"A Dark Matter\", and while its looser structure lends itself to a more detailed examination of the various characters that people the story, it can also find Straub indulgent and over-enamored of narrative dead-ends that dampen the momentum of the plot. Nevertheless, I preferred this version of the novel to \"A Dark Matter\" as it more fully embodies the reckless and meandering lives of the characters it explores. The biggest problem with this story, in either version, is the ultimate revelations of the character nicknamed Eel, who provides the last narrative recounting of this Rashomon-like tale. I found her story to be disappointing and at times both ludicrous and unconvincing. Had these insights been provided by the guru-like character who initiated these people into their reckoning with everyday evil, I would have taken them as the bloviated search for meaning that typified his character from the beginning, but coming from a woman almost embarrassingly idolized by practically everyone around her, her insights and experiences came across as hackneyed and corny, like the ruminations of an old hippy recounting his last great LSD trip. While I admire the author tremendously and cannot fault him for trying to handle loftier themes in a more varied emotional pallette, in this case I think the work can best be characterized as an interesting failure.Note on this edition: I found the number of grammatical errors (mostly missing or duplicated words) in this limited edition to be rather appalling. If Subterranean Press is going to go to the trouble of publishing this, the only edition of a book Peter Straub intended to record for posterity (and as a document for the examination of the creative process it is essential), then they have an obligation to do a better job of copy-editing. The mistakes are distracting and far too numerous."}], "description": "The incomparable master of horror and suspense returns with a powerful, brilliantly terrifying novel that redefines the genre in original and unexpected ways.The charismatic and cunning Spenser Mallon is a campus guru in the 1960s, attracting the devotion and demanding sexual favors of his young acolytes. After he invites his most fervent followers to attend a secret ritual in a local meadow, the only thing that remains is a gruesomely dismembered body\u2014and the shattered souls of all who were present.Years later, one man attempts to understand what happened to his wife and to his friends by writing a book about this horrible night, and it\u2019s through this process that they begin to examine the unspeakable events that have bound them in ways they cannot fathom, but that have haunted every one of them through their lives. As each of the old friends tries to come to grips with the darkness of the past, they find themselves face-to-face with the evil triggered so many years earlier. Unfolding through the individual stories of the fated group\u2019s members, A Dark Matter is an electric, chilling, and unpredictable novel that will satisfy Peter Straub's many ardent fans, and win him legions more.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "The Skylark", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6752960.The_Skylark", "average": 3.96, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1271156002l/6752960.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6941.Peter_Straub", "name": "Peter Straub"}], "type": ["Horror", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6752960-the-skylark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19581.Ghost_Story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19593.Floating_Dragon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19580.Shadowland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19577.Koko", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65505.The_Hellfire_Club"]}
