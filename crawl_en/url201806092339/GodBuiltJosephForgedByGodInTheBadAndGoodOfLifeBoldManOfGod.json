Something that many of us naturally want to reject sometimes but we need to come to the realization that God is truly in control, of everything.This book uses scripture as its bases, which is obvious. I recommend this book for every Christian, especially those going through some tragic time in their life. I know we do not want to think that God is bringing and orchestrating something negative in our life, but in those times we need to submit that God is truly king, and that no matter what bad things happen in our life it is for His purpose."}, {"userName": "Barry Karschner", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6103374-barry-karschner", "userReview": "Great book about how in really tough times and when you feel no hope God is there and at work. It goes through the life of Joseph and how God's hand was always on him. It shows how even when we cant understand things God is in control and working for our good. I must read for men."}, {"userName": "Matthew Lindell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11664637-matthew-lindell", "userReview": "Steve Farrar is one of my favorite \"men's authors\" - I've always appreciated his writing style in that he shares hard truths in a consumable, well researched, challenging, yet personable engaging way. This particular book caught me by surprise in that the entire theme is providence; God's providence (not his normal \"men's book\"). It's a doctrine that has been largely ignored in today's church. Farrar uses Joseph's life to illustrate the various aspects of providence and God's sovereignty, yet he wisely does so without invoking the Calvanist/Armenian debate. He tackles the concepts of evil, 9/11, pain and loss head-on but at the same with sensitivity. He is clear, through scripture in his thinking but not dogmatic and arrogant in his delivery (as so many are in these topics).An interesting aside was that he (likely unintentionally) contrasts Francis Chan's concept of calling. Chan argues, for example, that if we say \"we were called to live here or there\" yet there is no perceptible impact to that neighborhood, city, job, etc. have we really been called? Farrar says that God orchestrates all the components of our lives and uses them for his glory according to His plan. I'd love to hear these two guys discuss/debate that concept.Long story short, it's a good (easy - in the sense that it is accessible by all) read that reminds us that God is firmly in control."}, {"userName": "Cornell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9447554-cornell", "userReview": "I am not sure if I enjoyed this book because Steve Farrar is a great writer, or because it addressed something that I have been wrestling with for quite some time now. I think it's both. This was indeed a timely and timeless read. Steve Farrar takes the reader through the familiar story of Joseph and helps us to discover a not-so-familiar truth, that God is ALWAYS in control. He is in control of every single thing (positive and negative) that happens in my life. God is in control both over the good and the evil in the world. As hard to swallow as that pill may be, it has to be swallowed, for only then can we realize the healing and freedom that comes from knowing God is in control.I enjoyed every page of this book. I could barely put it down. I have learnt not to walk in regret or resentment over my own failures or negative circumstances. By constantly reminding me about the providence of God, Farrar has encouraged me to walk in obedience, forgetting what is past and maintaining my faith stride. Disappointments in life are really His appointments, and we must all learn to meet every obstacle with gratitude and praise. \"God Built\" was a great read. This is definitely not the last time I'll be reading this book. It has earned a treasured spot on my bookshelf.Thank you LORD, for reminding me through these words that you are there, you care and you are in control."}, {"userName": "Norm Konzelman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31079560-norm-konzelman", "userReview": "Though the book began in a way that I felt uncomfortable with, kind of a smart-Alecky jokester way, it soon became enjoyable and ended being a book I could really recommend to anyone, but especially someone young in the Lord or one needing encouragement.The book takes the Bible Joseph from the Old Testament and embellishes his life in the writers way of a modern kind of speech. He does take off from time to time to go on short examples of other Christians known famously throughout history that add to the main theme. God does know what He is doing. God does care about you. God does move events when He is ready. God does move events when you are ready. God is great! God is good! He wants you to know that, and use you to show that to others through your life.There are a few real gems here. It isn't a great book destined for historic reference, but I am glad I got to listen to the audio version.We all need encouragement from time to time."}, {"userName": "Brent Soderstrum", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1356105-brent-soderstrum", "userReview": "Steve Farrar uses the story of Joseph and all he went through to get home his point that God can take things that we view as bad and use them for His good. Farrar goes even one step further saying that all things that happen to us are ordained by God, including the things we view as bad or even evil. These things are for our own good in the long run. My men's Bible study group did this book and it brought up a lot of discussion. The questions at the end of each chapter are good for that. Just couldn't get on board with God ordaining evil leaders or doing evil things."}, {"userName": "Grant Davis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5952397-grant-davis", "userReview": "This book has some interesting stories in it as anecdote for his teachings. Unfortunately, the author has a tendency to repeat himself over and over. To some, this may appear as him enforcing his message, but it more closely resembles reading the same lesson 10 or 12 times with a different anecdote. In fact, anecdotes are used so often along with quotes from other authors that there is little of this book that is uniquely the author's. Overall, not a bad book if you are developing a study series, but I would still recommend condensing this book's content by a factor of 4 or 5."}, {"userName": "Brent Rosendal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859041-brent-rosendal", "userReview": "This is the first book I've read by Steve Farrar that wasn't related to family or manhood. I've enjoyed the other books he has written and this one is no exception. This one talked about the providence of God and how God works in our lives, often in ways that we do not understand. Steve used the life of Joseph as the foundation of his teaching. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is going through a time where we don't understand what God is trying to do."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9983212-sam", "userReview": "Joseph\u2026 Joseph\u2026 Joseph!One of those difficult-to-drop-untill-you-get-to-last-page reads.

The author is very passionate about the fact God is in absolute control of both the good and the bad that happens in our lives. He does occasionally belabour the point which is a bit annoying. I do however enjoy all the examples that he uses to build his case."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5275654-david", "userReview": "Very well written.
