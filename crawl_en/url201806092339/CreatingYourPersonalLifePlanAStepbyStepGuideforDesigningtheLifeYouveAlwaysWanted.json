It's also painful in that good way that healing often is.This isn't self-help platitudes or pablum. It's about getting your spiritual, mental, and physical house in order and keeping it in order. Beyond the basics of getting the plan set up and reviewing it regularly, Michael also recommends a few other resources, including the very popular book Getting Things Done; so far, Getting Things Done seems to be a good companion, getting into the micro-level where this very macro book has left off."}, {"userName": "Rebekka Steg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8778400-rebekka-steg", "userReview": "Creating a Personal Life Plan by Michael Hyatt is a short eBook, but the content is incredibly important and will have a huge influence on how you live your life - especially if you actually take the time to do the steps the book outlines.

Good book, but better to read the books and blog he is pulling from. Start with Covey's 7 habits, move to \"Getting Things Done\" and then read Hyatt's top blog articles on plans and productivity.

I think that\u2019s probably because creating a life plan seems so overwhelming and contingent on factors outside of our control.The book is quite helpful on those counts. Hyatt lays out some exercises and steps for determining where you want to go in life and then how to break that down into doable goals. Although a lot of his ideas are similar to other goal setting or achievement literature, I think his approach is unique and the book contains good resources.{Read more of my reviews at A Spirited Mind.}"}, {"userName": "Yolanda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2718379-yolanda", "userReview": "A quick read which I enjoyed because it reminded me to stay on task with my life plan.
