This book did that and more. I have read a lot of books in my time, from the Big 6 companies, to independent writers. Not surprisingly some of the best I have read comes from people with small presses.When I read a book I look at three things - 1 - Characters, if you have good/great characters they can carry a story no matter what. In Dead Hunger the Flex Sheridan Chronicles, Shelman focuses on the main character Flex. Of course since he is telling the story we learn a lot more about him, such as his capacity for love, the internal struggle he deals with in accepting that what he is up against are in fact zombies, and so much more. He is not some guy with a cape that can fix it all. He cries, he laughs, but most of all he does what he can to keep his family safe. There is also Gem his girlfriend who I would love to find out more about and Hemp Chatsworth, who I hope gets a chronicle of his own. Later in the story we are introduced to Charlie who I think will be a great asset to the team. And Lastly we have little Trina, the niece of Flex.Each character has their own set of quirks, way of speech, and all around personality that you like each one for different reasons.2 - Story - No matter how great your characters are if you write a bad story, nothing can save it sometimes. Again Shelman shows his ability to weave a tale by adding in several twists to the traditional zombie apocalypse that keep the tale fresh and moving forward at a fast pace. There is no lag or draggin down the reader in detail.Are the zombies smart? Can they learn? Are they teaching one another? All these questions and more are raised that help keep the readers imagination going, as well as their interest piqued.3 - Basic grammar, language, and other odd details - So many writers have crutch words, or invade word territory to the point it makes me insane. For example having the word rock in the same paragraph five times - not okay. Others disregard grammar thinking the above two are okay. In Dead Hunger I was more than impressed that none of these issues cropped up. None of the fight scenes were repetitive or felt like the same paragraph repeated. The grammar was spot.* There is strong language so be forewarned about that, but in reality if I was seeing what these folk were, my language would be strong as well.I also liked the fact that Shelman made his lead character have a heart. His goal is to save his sister, his family.This book is written well on so many levels that I think anyone who picked it up to read would enjoy. It has sad parts, gory parts, funny parts, and everything in-between. Most of all it grabs your attention from page one and does not let go until the end.Warning the end will leave you wanting more, I myself am now anxiously awaiting the Gem Cardoza Chronicles."}, {"userName": "Eila", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31677732-eila", "userReview": "There are a lot of zombie books on the market right now. I've come across some great ones and I've come across some that were just \"good\". This one falls in the \"great\" category. I originally purchased this book because Eric Shelman has a friendly, fun Facebook presence. I figured I would show my support and buy one of his books. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.First of all, the characters are fun and refreshing. Flex, the main character, is just an ordinary man whose main interest is staying alive in the changed world while keeping his loved ones safe. He has a huge heart and is not afraid to show it. At the same time, he is realistic and doesn't back down from making difficult decisions when he has to. Shelman does an excellent job balancing these two characteristics, creating an unforgettable, albeit imperfect hero. The other characters introduced in the book are just as likable, but this is Flex's story so the main focus is on him in this book. The second reason Dead Hunger: The Flex Sheridan Chronicle gets 5 stars is because there are some unique twists when it comes to the zombies in this story. I appreciate Eric Shelman making the characteristics and actions of his zombies just a little different than most. I'm not going to explain what I mean by that. That would spoil it for new readers. Shelman weaves just the right amount of humor into the many intense scenes that take place in the book. This doesn't create a distraction, however. What it does, is make the book more realistic to me. We are often the cause of our own comedy and Flex Sheridan is no exception. As I stated above, he is imperfect and I love that there is humor in that.A couple times, the story gets a little bogged down with details when it comes to weapons and vehicles, but this was only a minor issue for me. The rest of the story more than makes up for those moments.The advantage to finding a series later, rather than sooner, is I don't have to wait for the next book to be written. I will definitely be reading the next several installments of this series as soon as I can!"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4363329-mary", "userReview": "Not my cup of tea at all and I love zombie stories. Couldn't get into it since the characters and their way of speaking seemed more like teens than older adults and it just seemed like an average nothing special zombie story where the MCs become way too proficient way too fast....everything was too easy."}, {"userName": "Lana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12453955-lana", "userReview": "I am an unabashed zombie fan. A fanatic even. I have read just under a bajillion zombie-themed books (plus or minus a jillion). One would think there wasn\u2019t a lot new that could be brought to the zombie genre with the recent influx of zombie books, zombie movies and zombie tv. One would be wrong. I picked up Dead Hunger: The Flex Sheridan Chronicle after having it in my to-be-read queue for quite some time, and I have to say, I wish I hadn\u2019t waited. The author has given us a story that is smart, funny, exciting, dangerous and full of heart. The story grabbed me right away, with Flex Sheridan setting out to save his sister. We can all relate, as I hope most of us would want to save a loved one who called us in trouble (I just want to say, I\u2019m sorry for any of the things I may or may not have done to my brother when we were kids just in case!). The characters are fleshed out and so well written, each having their own voice and personalities, strengths and quirks, so that you really get to know them and care about them. I may even have a little bit of a crush on Flex, but we all know a guy this good just has to be fiction, right? *wink* And the zombies. The zombies here have a new trick, they aren\u2019t your typical zombies. The writing is good, and I mean really good. Its professional and well edited. It ends leaving me ready to jump into Dead Hunger II: The Gem Cardoza Chronicle to continue the saga and find out what happens to Flex, Gem, Hemp, Charlie and my favorite little zombie ass kicker, Trina, with her Great Pyrenees, Bunson. This is definitely the team I want to be on when the zombie apocalypse arrives!"}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4810658-kristina", "userReview": "I really, really enjoyed this book. I don't honestly read a lot of zombie novels, but in my opinion, this one had it all: family dynamics to cherish and sever, a romantic interest, a CDC brainiac/engineer, a remote hideaway, a kid, puppies, and lots of zombie killing. I enjoyed the entire vibe of this book. The stress, the humor, and the way it was told as if chronicling events that are happening for the sake of future generations. I look forward to more mayhem in the next volume. Side note... Me meeting the author in 2016 at the South West Florida Reading Festival... :)He is a super nice gentleman!"}, {"userName": "Sue Julsen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4661828-sue-julsen", "userReview": "ACTION-PACKED, RELENTLESSLY SUSPENSEFULAlthough not usually a fan of zombie books, Shelman's 'Dead Hunger' changed my mind. This is not your normal, run of the mill, \"I saw that coming\" zombie story. The well-rounded characters are not only exciting but extremely likable as they forge forward, not knowing what they will encounter next, who will survive and who might not, as they search for other uninfected humans in this new and frightening world.Many nights I forced myself to put the book down and go to sleep, only to find myself dreaming about what I'd read. I've never had a book do that, and it was thrilling! I'm just glad I bought the sequel at the same time I bought this book because I'd hate to have to wait to read what happens next! Well done Eric Shelman!"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2042627-jen", "userReview": "Wasn't too bad - but there was too much coincidence, and telling."}, {"userName": "Misti", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34386522-misti", "userReview": "OK, book 9 in the Ultimate Undead Collection: Zombie Apocalypse Best Sellers Boxed Set (10 books).

Flex is thinking back to how it began with him trying to get to his sister Jamie, her husband and two daughters, which leads to the rest of the book being a flashback. I hate it when authors do this because we are being told who is alive and dead before we get to the flashback which shows you all of the events taking place. If we had started with Jamie's phone call and Flex rushing over to see what happened, it would have been full of tension and much more enjoyable instead of being spoiled in advance! Removing that prologue and sorting a few niggles might have produced another half or full star for my rating of the book. (NB before you yell about half stars not being available on GR, I'm referring to my blog rating)Flex is a guy on a mission to save his family and try to find a cure for his infected sister. The scenes where he travels to Jamie's house and finds out what happened are very well written and would have been tense and exciting if we hadn't already been told who survived. Flex and Gem have a good chemistry and the fact that they had a relationship before the book starts means we don't have to go through all the love angst and 'getting together' stuff that annoys me in zombie books that feature romance. Besides, this is not romance based, just two people with a connection that spend most of their time fighting the undead or grabbing supplies and rescuing people. The one thing about them that annoyed me was their obsession with drugs. Seriously, how many books in this genre feature dope smoking characters? It really bugs me and I don't like it in my MCs.I like Hemp and not just because he is British. He is a smart man who has a lot of ideas for protection and defence, which I found interesting, although at times the descriptions got just a bit too technical for my liking and I found it difficult to imagine what was actually happening. I think it needs to be simplified a bit for us ordinary people! I also liked the amount of action in the book. WE had the events at the house, the police station, the CDC and the housing area, all of which I thought were nicely written and kept you wondering what was coming next. You must have plenty zombies in a zombie novel after all and this does not disappoint!I'm not as keen on the idea of these intelligent zombies who are finding a way to store the bodies in a cool place to preserve their food supply, but it did lead to an exciting rescue attempt so I put my preferences to one side and enjoyed the action. Having zombies able to spray a mist from their eyes to make victims pass out was maybe a bit much for me though it was certainly different. I guess it makes a change to see that in a zombie book, but I hope the smart zombie thing isn't taken too far in this series if I read on. One big plot hole that bugged me was the police station search. Flex goes to a lot of trouble to find a pharmacy to get something to make Trina sleep in the car so she doesn't see the zombies and victims they pass. Yes, a good idea, along with a big quilt for her to hide under to be out of sight in the car while Flex and Gem take care of business. So why drug her, then carry her into the dark police station, rendering you a hand short for using the guns, not checking all the bodies are really dead and having the zombies and gunfire inside waking her up? How could they take a young kid into a building that was dark and full of dead bodies, that they hadn't fully secured? Crazy stuff. The other plot hole is how they lie to Trina all the time about her mother being away, yet discuss Jamie being dead and infected and locked up in the van outside while the girl is sitting at their feet-yet Trina doesn't know anything??? Baffling.Despite a few flaws this is a decent, action packed zombiefest with good characters and plenty going on. It is well worth a read and I'll probably continue with the series."}, {"userName": "Amanda Felix", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17820136-amanda-felix", "userReview": "I am a zom-poc fan, don't deny it, don't make excuses for it. They are just plain fun to read but there comes a point when the subject is inundated with zombie novels/books/stories and they are all the same with the exception of a few, Mark Tufo, James Cook, Shawn Chesser come to mind. Eric Shelman can now be counted in those few writers I enjoy. The beginning of the series is told through the eyes of the main character, Flex Sheridan and the story begins rather quickly. He has called his little sister intent on coming in for a visit, he lives in Georgia and she in Florida. But something is wrong and the words and screams he hears over the phone has him rushing to his sisters house although it takes him several hours to get there. Because he is several hours away the drive for him is distracting, not wanting to believe what he heard but fearing the worst. Along the way, in hindsight, he pays no attention to the signs around him that something is not right with the world and what could be a precursor to a nightmare he will not soon awaken from. The horrific scene he discovers upon his arrival is only the beginning. He now has only his niece, six year old Trina and his ex girl friend, Gem, who has faced her own tragic turn of events and risks all to find him again. Together they cross Florida in search of help which they soon learn will not be forthcoming. Zombies are everywhere but they refuse to call them that thinking it is just to Clich\u00e9 and refer to the affected people as Abnormals. And Gem is not the swooning girl type either. She arrives sporting an Uzi and knowing they will need food and supplies if they are to survive tells him how to find weapons; at a police station because they have the best evidence... all types of weapons and weed. It is at a police station they find Hemp Chatsworth in a cell who just happens to be a biochemist/engineer and will soon find a woman name Charlie who handles a wicked Crossbow. The five bond quickly as is necessary in these sudden times of danger around every corner while they try to understand what is happening. And the biggest question of all is WHY? Why were they spared from what ever disease that afflicted so many and not them. The first book in the series does not dwell overly much on the how and why of it, just their attempts at securing a safe haven until they can make sense of a world suddenly gone mad. One thing is made very clear, whether they want to call them zombies or not, these are no ordinary zombies, for they have a secret... well actually they have a couple but Flex and his group, although having seen characteristics not seen on movie and TV zombies, want only to stay hidden and safe. They really don't want to seek out other survivors reasoning they are better off on their own not wanting the headache that will surely come with a large group. And too, they now have Trina to consider. These people are not hero's rushing in to save mankind and they don't make excuses about it. They want to be safe. But how can they when by Hemps humble estimation 90% of the population may be turned.. and he is not even sure about Europe since there has been no communication or anyone alive to say different.Hemp is invaluable because of his background, Flex is not so bad himself and Gem and Charlie are not the whining, helpless female type. They hold their own and in some cases better than the men which is a plus in this new world. And the twist in the Zombie mystery kept me reading to the last page. It's different and that is what I look for but it has to be good and I got both."}, {"userName": "Alina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31927139-alina", "userReview": "The Name Eric A.Shelman was floating true the eter, on manny of my friends Facebook pages. The series Dead Hunger was highly recomended, and i was a litle bitt sceptic.I started to read in the evening, thinking that i will only gett a few pages and call it a day. At 2 am in the morning i was struggling to put the kindle down and go to sleep. I read the book in toe sittings and only because work has this habbit of interfiering with my reading.Because i always feel that i have the duty to actually read a book that i purchase, i decided to buy just book 1 first(now i am sad, i should have brought the set, because they are just actually great) The hero has actually a funny name, Flex, first i was thinking about a bodybuilder guy, but he is actually a down to earth electrician . The story is catchy and fast, and the end leaves you there, wishing for some more .. Afther you finish the first volume you will just care for Gem, Flexy, Hemp, Charlie , Trina and Bunsen. You wanna know who this guys are, buy the book, read it and you will find out more. Because i always tell something about the Zombies , i must say, chappeau, Eric A Shelman brings something new to the Zombie as a dead but living and feeding entithy. Shelmans Zombies can produce a neurotoxine that can put a human in a temporary coma, that spiked my interest. The Story line flows free, the caracters are natural and believable, there are not artificial or forced. The connection btw our hero, Flex Sheridan and the leading lady Gem is honest and strong, ist like a warm feeling that spreads out of the book. The only thing that i think was a litle bitt forced was the way the toe of them met again. He was just about to burry his niece and she was just standing there, looking for him. But i can look over this, because Gem is the kind of woman that can handle the zombie apocalypse. I will buy the next ones , and will be enternained for a few days at the speed that i go true the pages, my kindle is smoking ."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4634710-rebecca", "userReview": "Dead Hunger is an action packed, heat packing, zombie killing, fast paced ride!When Flex goes to check on his sister he walks into a horrific surprise waiting for him. I liked Flex\u2019s character. He does what is right out of love and the simple fact that it\u2019s the right thing to do. The atmosphere that Mr. Shelman creates while Flex is at his sisters house opened up the story to the fact that the whole world was about to change--being overrun with zombies. Mr. Shelman used Flex\u2019s family to make me care right off the bat\u2026I don\u2019t know that I would have felt so much for the situation were it not for Flex\u2019s niece. That really pulled me in.While Flex is at his sisters house he meets up with his old girlfriend, Gem. OK, I\u2019m not gonna lie it bothered me that she just so happened to come right to Flex on the day the world was going to pot. I liked Flex and Gem together but separate I had a hard time relating to her. I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on it, but the next book in the series is Gem\u2019s so maybe that will changeI did however love Hemp! Hemp is a genius scientist and a jack of all trades (Did I mention his accent?). He knows everything about guns and cars\u2026I could use some of Hemp\u2019s inventions when I\u2019m going down I-85. Yes, I know I just sounded a little scary, but he made super cool stuff. I think he is my favorite character and I am really excited for his book. If you like zombie reads I think you will like Dead Hunger. One of my favorite quotes:\u201c Cutting off the head just makes a dangerous bowling ball with teeth. You get bit, you become one. Scratched, we\u2019re pretty sure you become one. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know, but just act like what we\u2019re telling you is gospel, and you should live to tell your grandkids about this. \u201dThis was a fast read. It was between a 3 and 4 but I don\u2019t do half's. Just a warning in the description when it says strong language, it\u2019s not joking and there is a lot of it.

Shelmans, Dead Hunger are a rare breed. Just when i thought it was only Jonathan Maberry, and his tremendous, Rot & Ruin series, that could address the ZA in a truly emotional, and non GungHo manner, Dead Hunger came along.This ZA story is almost traditional in it's inception, but this is so much more than that. Could beautiful be used to describe Dead Hunger? I believe it can, and parts of the story, are truly touching, and heartbreaking.The characterization is immense, and deeply solid, with Flex, our main hero recounting the beginning of the ZA. There is simply nothing to dislike about Flex. He feels real, and authentic.Be in no doubt, that this book has the gore factor, but know the author, has poured a ton of emotion into each character, making them so real, they almost jump off the page.For me the biggest improvement this tale has, over 95% of other ZA books I've read, is it only contains the tiniest sprinkle of religion, but mostly Flex our main character, is flawed, and human.There's no Rambo, brute force, super hero's in this book. The characters are genuine, and you feel the struggles they encounter, morally, and physically.Written with such effortless fluidity, i found myself swept along with the survivors, feeling their pain, and fear. One of the best ZA books I've had the pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "R Martine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34351519-r-martine", "userReview": "Have you ever made such a drastic mistake that at one point it becomes all you can think about?

In an effort to save his younger sister, Flex re-connects with perhaps the strongest woman he knows - Gem Cardoza, his former girlfriend. Together they take his six-year-old niece Trina, the only uninfected survivor of his sister's family, and his infected sister Jamie, and make a run from central Florida back to his isolated home in Lula, Georgia. As they head north, they encounter another uninfected, Hemphill \"Hemp\" Chatsworth. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Hemp is British, and extremely smart. He holds a degree in Epidemiology and Mechanical Engineering, both of which this group will need. Along with the crossbow-wielding Charlene \"Charlie\" Sanders and a pregnant Great Pyrenees dog, this small group uses street smarts, book smarts, and technology to defend against the new \"Abnormals\" that walk the earth. But Hemp is also compelled to learn how they got this way, and if possible, how to reverse the condition and save Flex's sister. So grab your machine gun and take a ride in their fortified vehicles and mobile lab; you're going to want these people on your side when the Dead Hunger...
