Here, I must. I read The Star Fox by Poul Anderson from a 1965 edition paperback I picked up at a used bookstore in Kentucky. The cover art is so dumb I almost did not buy the thing, except that I am on a mission to read all I can of Anderson and many of his earlier works are hard to find.Having commented upon the unfortunate artwork to begin with, let me say now that the old maxim that you cannot judge a book by its cover is in full form here, as Anderson has written a sci-fi gem. The Star Fox is good, well-explained and inventive hard science fiction with a humanist flair, and the author tells a damn fine adventure story to boot. A little dated, yes, and sexist, and it drags a bit in the middle, but a good story all the same. Heinlein would have been proud to produce this. Good enough to be nominated for a Nebula Award but lost to Dune."}, {"userName": "Taro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3838350-taro", "userReview": "Dear dear dear..........I'll try to be nice. But. The mysogyny.... it's bad even for the 60's! And the book is quite dated. I nearly choked from chuckling when he just wanted to get back to 'his pipe and slippers.' But let's get to the beat here.The Star Fox has, at the least, on the base an interesting story, that maybe could be done differently. Earth's first (? but it seems highly likely) extrasolar colony (founded by France - Vietnam??) is raided by aliens who claim it too close to their system. Officially, the aliens, a cat-like race that seems brittle as glass, slightly shorter than humans, socially collective and communicate tonally (Chinese, anyone?), claim that they were attacked, retaliated and in the crossfires the planet was nuked, and there were no survivors. Desperate for peace (DAMN HIPPIES), the Earth Federation (Euroamerican race) tries to pacify the invaders. But only Gunhar Heim, former STAR FOX Captain knows the truth: the colonists were attacked by the aliens and the survivors taken prisoner. So Heim must raise arms as a privateer to convince Earth that War is the Answer.So it seems Anderson wanted this to represent the Vietnam War, and why we should fight. There's even a passage in there where the alien admiral (or whatever he's supposed to be) explains why manifest destiny is not really the greatest thing ever, for the other societies. See. Earth society (European), though much younger than the aliens (Asians), grew, mechanically and industrially much faster than them, and soon took over as much space as they could; now crouching over dangerously near the alien's territory with no sign of stopping. Think about it in the context of Indochina and how much the natives love imperialism. He's of course, a hippie jerk who must die because as we all know, the universe is made for humans (Europeans). MANIFEST DESTINY!Oh. And now let's talk about the writing style. Yes, it's pulp. I think maybe, this is the first pulp book I've read in a long time, if ever. The minstrel character, he doesn't do jack squat but sing old folk songs, that everybody somehow still knows even though most of them are unknown in 2012, lots in untranslated French or Hungarian. And the random quips in different languages! It looks like my first year in college where I would put random Latin words in essays so I'll look smart. It doesn't make you look smart, it makes you look pompous. Sacr\u00e9 bleu!"}, {"userName": "Mary Catelli", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21198579-mary-catelli", "userReview": "This is a fix-up of three short stories -- in rapid succession, developing the plot straightforwardly.There was armed conflict over a planet called New Europe. The aliens -- the Aleriona -- claim an accidental conflct erupted into violence that killed all the colonists. But Gunnar Heim, having old ties to the planet, meets up with Endre Vadasz, who claims to have escaped and have proof that many of them are still alive.No one will listen to him, or to Heim either, except France (most of the colonists having been French), but judicious exploitation of loopholes reveals that Heim can send forth a privateer, properly commissioned with letters of marque and reprisal. . . .It involves an alien world where nuclear attacks aren't a big deal, scurvy, moving trees, a kidnapping, violent attacks by peace militants, the Aleriona not living in groups so much that Earth must give them separate residence or insult them, and much more."}, {"userName": "Janelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51475010-janelle", "userReview": "A first rate, if a little dated, read by Poul Anderson. Gunnar Heim cannot allow the Federation to do nothing about the potential slaughter of half a million people on New Europe by the Alerionians. Even when presented with proof, he can find few who are willing to act. He stakes his life's work and fortune to become a privateer in hopes that the people will be unable to ignore what is happening and take up a call to act. The book is short and fast-paced with a great human element to the characters."}, {"userName": "Erik Graff", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff", "userReview": "This, like many of Anderson's novels, is basically political science fiction.

If you're one of these millennials with a five-minute attention span, you may find the formality and density of the prose daunting, but rest assured: as with everything else, you're wrong.Bonus points for what may be, despite a degree of ambiguity, SF literature's first gay alien."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5363823-david", "userReview": "This is an excellent sci-fi novel, my only complaint being being that the episodic nature (probably stemming from it being serialized first) makes it read as though it is a condensed version of a longer novel.

Acting in the manor of a legalised pirate alongside a traveling musician and a Dolphin-like alien engineer, Heim battles the odds, gets drunk a lot, behaves with the emotional maturity of a teenager and does some unlikely things in spaceships to save the day.The Star Fox is a Golden Age period 'hard science' story of space adventure, with simplified characterisations and lame-assed plotting from Anderson, who would later do much better than this. All I can really remember about it an hour after finishing are some choice Scandinavian oaths and the irritatingly twisted semantics of the alien speech.A weak effort."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10296425-james", "userReview": "I have to say I'm disappointed. Sure, it's a golden age science fiction novel and times and mores change, but... it's not really golden age, to start with. Written in the mid-1960s it would have been about ten years behind the times even when it was first published. The \"using war to fight for peace\" message would have embarrassed Heinlein, and some sections are mildly polemic - and worse is the attitude towards women, there in the plot to simper, cause jealousies between the men (the real stars of the show, of course), and to be the bait in a honey trap. Tie that in with some hand-waving \"don't question this, it's (bad) science\" writing to more the plot along, and even with the interesting premise and fine writing style of the author (who should not be judged on the basis of this work!), I can't give it more than two stars."}, {"userName": "Sarah Matts", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11825123-sarah-matts", "userReview": "Some interesting ideas for the political situation and the future of humanity in this book. However, I found the characters to be dull and/or annoying in turns.Although I have read older books where women are somewhat useless (there is a part in this where they are trapped on a high-gravity planet and have to make a journey across its surface and the woman is useless from the off because she is a poor, weak thing,) this is the first book I've read where it makes a woman a prize to be won in such literal terms. The main character actually laments the unfairness of life because being the \"hero\" of the piece, he should have \"won\" the \"princess\". This is even creeper, because who is the princess? Yep, the daughter of his former love.It had me shuddering and cringing and feeling like I was unwelcome to the story.It is also 50% songs in random languages."}, {"userName": "B.

But Anderson is a totally enjoyable author and the story never devolves into a tale of privateers (kind of bummed about that, but I understand why). He focuses instead on the enjoyable characters and a look at how different folks do it differently and how folks should probably remember that.Enjoyable space battles and political lawyering. I didn't even get bored with those parts!"}, {"userName": "Colin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1928210-colin", "userReview": "Fairly good overall story about the alien occupation of one of Earth's newest extra-solar colonies (might be the first, the book is vague).
