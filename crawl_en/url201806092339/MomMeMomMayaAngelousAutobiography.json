This morning, I read \u201cMom & Me & Mom\u201d which was delightful, wonderful, sometimes sad, sometimes not, but throughout has that same lovely tone that I found in \u201cLetter to My Daughter.\u201d I\u2019d read poems of hers before, seen her speak, although not in person, but there\u2019s something about her that just reaches inside your soul and tugs on it while reading, or listening, to her words. Someday, I will get an audio copy of this to listen to, I suspect just hearing her distinctive voice read these words would add another level of impact. \u201dSuppose I really am going to become somebody, imagine.\u201dMothers and Daughters. In Maya\u2019s case, she barely knew her mother, Vivian Baxter, before she was shipped off to live with her paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson, along with her brother Bailey. Bailey was five years old to Maya\u2019s three. Babies, put on a train with notes attached to them.\u201dI was three and Bailey was five when we arrived in Stamps, Arkansas. We had identification tags on our arms and no adult supervision. \u201cIt would take a while for them to re-establish a place for her mother in Maya\u2019s life, and primarily in her heart. For a long time, she called her Lady, which made me smile, a name my daughter calls me now and then. When she was first re-entering that space, with a new stepfather in the picture, their relationship was cautious, tentative, slowly growing over the years \u2013 but growing.  \u201cShe had my back, supported me. This is the role of the mother, and in that visit I really saw clearly, and for the first time, why a mother is really important. Not just because she feeds and also loves and cuddles and even mollycoddles a child, but because in an interesting and maybe an eerie and unworldly way, she stands in the gap. She stands between the unknown and the known.\u201d There are some of the stories of her life that are included in her \u201cLetter to My Daughter,\u201d but there is sometimes comfort in that, much like once-again hearing some of my father\u2019s favourite flying stories when he had a new, and willing, audience. There\u2019s joy in hearing wisdom repeated, tales that your heart takes and translates into your life, your language, your being. I loved reading about the progression of their relationship, Maya and her mother, Vivien, when all those doubts had faded away, when proof of love was no longer required or questioned, and most of all I loved seeing more of her heart and its wisdom. \u201dHer love and support encouraged me to dare to live my life with pizazz.\u201dHighly Recommended"}, {"userName": "Jennifer ~ TarHeelReader & Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32340179-jennifer-tarheelreader-traveling-sister", "userReview": "The audio was read by Maya Angelou herself. Angelou has always been a special wonder to me. She was a professor at a nearby university, and I grew up mesmerized by her. It makes me sad to think this was her last book, that there will be no more gifts like this one. The mother-daughter relationship she experienced was tentative, tender, and complicated. This was only a fraction of her life experience shared, and the distance she traveled in that time, the adversity she and her mother overcame; it was heartening. Vivian Baxter ended up being quite the mother and protector to Maya."}, {"userName": "Mariah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah", "userReview": "I read this first book to Maya's autobiographies and then saw this one (the last one) available and decided to read it. I read these books for the Goodreads' book club Diversity in All Forms. If you would like to participate in the discussion here is the link below: https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...In this story Maya shares her deep and difficult relationship with her mother all the way to her mom's passing. Three-year-old Maya and her older brother were sent to Arkansas to live with their grandmother. Maya lived there for years without seeing or knowing her mother at all. Mom & Me & Mom, shares Maya's story of her mother she preferred to simply call \u201cLady,\u201d revealing the profound moments that shifted the balance of love and respect between them.This was a great read and it didn't feel out of place to skip around in her autobiographies.

Mom and Me and Mom is a book devoted to her mother Vivian Baxter. When Maya was three she was sent to Stamps Arkansas with her then five year old brother Bailey. she wrote a book \"I know why the Caged Bird Sings\" describing her ten years there with her grandmother who raised the two children. Maya Angelou knew very little about her mother until she was thirteen and sent to San Francisco to live with her mother. Her Book Mom & Me & Mom describes her life and experiences and her mother's involvement with her life. She also speaks of her beloved son Guy who she had at seventeen years old. this is sort of a \"love story\" devoted to her mother and how she inspired and encouraged her talented to daughter to reach for the sky and succeed. Maya Angelou went on to make her mother proud. the book ends with her mother's death of lung cancer. at the end of the book Maya tells her mother\"you were a terrible mother of small children,but there has never been anyone greater than you as a mother of a young adult\" i found this to be a touching well written book. I enjoyed reading very much."}, {"userName": "Kerene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8465808-kerene", "userReview": "I was expecting a letdown. After holding her in the highest regard, reading all of her books - especially loving her autobiographies - it wasn't until college that I was mature enough to appreciate her poetry - I didn't think there was anything more she could say. Hasn't she said enough? The spell would be gone. How could it possibly hold me from the age of 9 to 33? I was wrong. It was very much like greeting an old friend. The beginning of the book was glittered with old truths wisely told in her first autobiography. I was a little confused, and even flipped back to the title page to make sure I had downloaded the right book. It wasn't long before the reader is securely reacquainted and eager to travel the familiar roads. Her mother is awesome, and never fails to surprise - whether she's brandishing a handgun in a hotel lobby, or knocking down a door to save her dying daughter, you will listen, learn, and re-learn wisdom. I definitely enjoyed this book."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "I loved this memoir by Angelou, because although many horrible things happened to her this is not a pity memoir. It is presented and told in a straight forward manner, a kind of this is my story take it or leave it. Loved the relationship between her and her mom, although that relationship took a while in coming, also the love she felt for her brother, Bailey. She accomplished so many things, in so many different fields and places, which is awe inspiring, especially during the time period when women were fighting to be recognized, let alone a black women. Loved the pictures, wish there had been a few more. What a admirable woman and role model.

reunited with her mother after many years of estrangement and abandonment. We get to meet \"Lady\" as Maya calls her mother the vivacious Vivian Baxter. The tone of the writing and also narrated by Maya herself in this audiobook is delightful and lovely, there's almost a childlike quality in her storytelling. To know that Maya was once a shy young girl who hardly spoke at all makes you see her magnificent growth as a woman with a magic soul and tender heart. Her self belief and pure goodness makes her a beacon of light for those who haven't started with much but possess a steely determination to make something of herself and inspire others.

She was an author, a poet, a civil rights activist, a singer, a dancer, an actress, a professor, a composer, and so much more. But she was also a daughter, a sister, and a mother. And those roles were what this book, her seventh and final autobiography, focused on, connecting them back to the one person who had, for better or worse, influenced her the most--her mother, Vivian Baxter. Ms. Angelou's relationship with her mother was a complicated one that changed greatly over her lifetime. Maya's parents divorced when she was three, and neither parent could cope with raising their children on their own, so Maya and her older brother, Bailey, were sent to live with their paternal grandmother for a decade. Her grandmother took fine care of them, but she wasn't any substitute for the mother whom both children longed for each day. Eventually, Maya's mother sent for the children, prepared to be a mother to them again. But Maya and her brother weren't prepared to be her daughter and son, no longer trusting their mother or willing to forgive and forget her abandonment of them. Maya went so far as to refuse to call Vivian \"Mother\" and settled on calling her \"Lady\" instead, while her brother had his own issues, with devastating consequences. And later on, as Maya grew into her own person, it became clear to her that her mother's abandonment could appear in many forms that had nothing to do with whether her mother was physically present or not. There were times when her mother blew in and out of her life, showing love and attention, then withdrawing them when she disapproved of Maya's choices. So how did Maya get beyond this point to where she could write this book honoring her mother whom she would later point to as the reason she was able to to be whatever or whomever she chose to be? That's what this book will tell you. And it will tell you many other things about the author's life that were as strange and fantastical as anything you'd find in a work of fiction. This book sounds interesting so far, so why only three stars? As lovely as this story sounds, a near fairy tale, though a dark one at times, the style in which the book was written took much away from its impact for me. The dialogue was written in such a strange, stiff way, a near robotic, herky-jerky way, as if it had been written in a different language originally and had been put through google translate to transform it into stilted English. Whatever the reason for this stylistic choice, it sounded unnatural and made it difficult for me to believe these were the actual words spoken by Maya and the people in her life. Another problem I had with the book was all the skipping around of events that occurred in the last third of it. Up until that point, the telling of the events in the author's life proceeded smoothly in a natural sequence. Then suddenly, the sections were leaping forward in time by months or years, and sometimes decades. What happened to and during all that missing time? I never did learn the answer to this. And as for what the author did choose to include, I sometimes asked myself, \"Is this stuff for real?\" So much of it seemed like a soap opera. But instead of there being histrionics, Maya reported everything that happened calmly like she was reading off a grocery list. Maybe this detachment was how she could face the physical and emotional abuse she endured, but it seemed strange and kept me at a distance from her. So, for me, this book was worth reading for what I learned about the author, and for its inspiring message of love and perseverance. But I never truly connected with Maya, her mother, or her brother due to the stilted language and glossing over of certain elements in her life. Still, I guess this book did as the author intended. She wanted to show that love heals and liberates, and she did so by celebrating her successes that she attributed to her mother. It made me think about my own daughters and how I hope I have helped them, as well."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "From BBC Radio 4 - Book of the Week:Maya Angelou's account of her relationship with her mother, Vivian Baxter."}, {"userName": "Sheila ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/774914-sheila", "userReview": "I have not read any other books by Maya Angelou, but have always wanted to read I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.

I can still remember picking up a tattered copy of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings in my teens when I didn't think much of reading. It was the book that transformed me into a bookworm. In Mom & Me & Mom, Maya Angelou engages the reader right off the bat. This book spans Maya's interactions with her mother throughout her life. One can easily see how \"Lady B\" had a pronounced effect on Ms Angelou when reading the life lessons that Vivian Baxter taught her daughter and the way in which she taught them. Vivian Baxter was a indomitable force who, though sometimes didn't use conventional ways to get her desired outcome, always seemed to achieve her desired goal.Mom & Me & Mom explores Maya's arduous yet highly rewarding relationship with her mother through the many highs and lows of her long career and brings the reader to an understanding of how Ms Angelou became the person she is today. For fans of Maya Angelou's work, this book will give the reader a deeper understanding of the many trials and tribulations of her life and her relationship with her mother.

Initially, we don't know if she was still with those people so close to her. What happened? At another place in the story, she speaks of the merchant marines with whom her mother sailed. Huh? It wasn't until later in the book that was explained. She spoke of being a CME, and I may be the only person in the world who doesn't know what that means, but an explanation would have helped.Some of the writing is wonderful, but much left me wanting more, more of her life, more of her talent, more satisfaction, just more.I was given an advance reader's copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Mmars", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2243098-mmars", "userReview": "On reading, this book felt disjointed.

Within minutes of finishing the book, I sat down to eat dinner and ran across a quote of Angelou's in the newspaper and a story describing a young woman's summer internship encouraging other women to write their stories. The intern discussed the importance of the individuality of one's storytelling. Am I the only one these things happen to? And, lately, not even occasionally, but, like, all the time. I had been a bit frustrated by the direct and simple manner of this memoir, and by the lack of time awarness. How old was Angelou when this happened? What year did this happen, etc. But, when thought of as stories and storytelling, rather than as memoir, the book was transformed in my mind. Angelou writes in HER style, of her unique relationship with her mother. Abandoned to her grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas at a young age, and then reunited in California in her teens. Kissed, for the first time, by a mother. For several years, Maya thinks of and calls her mother \"lady.\" But, throughout her adult years, her mother is always there for Maya with off-beat wisdom and love, both tough and soothing.

Maya Angelou tackles this emotional minefield in her new book, Mom & Me & Mom. Vivian Baxter was physically small, but had a larger than life personality. Because her marriage was in its last days and neither she nor her husband felt capable of being effective parents, Vivian took her children from California to live with their grandmother in the small community of Stamps, Arkansas. Maya and her older brother, Bailey, would remain in the rural South for ten years before returning to California. Maya was 13 years old when her grandmother took her back to California and the reconciliation between Maya and her mother would, not surprisingly, take decades. This book is told in a series of vignettes rather than in a straight linear style which I think is the natural way in which a daughter reflects on her life and interactions with her mother. I felt that while this book was very revealing about the ups and downs of the Maya/Vivian relationship, I also thought that it hides as much as it reveals. But, again, that reflects the depth and life-long connection that exists between a mother and daughter. I could tell stories for hours about my own mother, who died almost two years ago, and I wouldn't begin to do more than scratch the surface. And, depending on which stories I am telling and to whom, people would come away with completely different conclusions about our relationship and they would probably all be right."}, {"userName": "Mary Bronson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4184699-mary-bronson", "userReview": "I thought this was a great book.

But now, at last, the legendary author shares the deepest personal story of her life: her relationship with her mother. \u00a0 For the first time, Angelou reveals the triumphs and struggles of being the daughter of Vivian Baxter, an indomitable spirit whose petite size belied her larger-than-life presence\u2014a presence absent during much of Angelou\u2019s early life. When her marriage began to crumble, Vivian famously sent three-year-old Maya and her older brother away from their California home to live with their grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas. The subsequent feelings of abandonment stayed with Angelou for years, but their reunion, a decade later, began a story that has never before been told. In Mom & Me & Mom, Angelou dramatizes her years reconciling with the mother she preferred to simply call \u201cLady,\u201d revealing the profound moments that shifted the balance of love and respect between them. \u00a0 Delving into one of her life\u2019s most rich, rewarding, and fraught relationships, Mom & Me & Mom explores the healing and love that evolved between the two women over the course of their lives, the love that fostered Maya Angelou\u2019s rise from immeasurable depths to reach impossible heights.", "title": "Mom & Me & Mom\n      \n          (Maya Angelou's Autobiography #7)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15798797-mom-me-mom", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344371038l/15798797.jpg", "reviews": 1578, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3503.Maya_Angelou", "name": "Maya Angelou"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Feminism", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15798797-mom-me-mom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18698367-mom-me-mom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17655520-mom-and-me-and-mom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36595130", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35622363-mom-me-mom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15928487-mom-me-mom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39321263-mam-e-eu-mam-e", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21360244-mom-and-me-and-mom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16054669-mom-me-mom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21526423-annem-ve-ben", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13214.I_Know_Why_the_Caged_Bird_Sings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5160.The_Heart_of_a_Woman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4016515-letter-to-my-daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/130200.Gather_Together_in_My_Name", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9444.The_Complete_Collected_Poems"]}
