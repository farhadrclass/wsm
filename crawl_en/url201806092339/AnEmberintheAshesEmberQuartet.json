You will spark and burn, ravage and destroy. You cannot change it. You cannot stop it.\u201d\nI think a lot of people will understand me when I say that the best kind of books are those that provoke strong emotions in you. My favourites are made up of books that filled me with happy excitement or, alternatively, books that ripped my heart out and made me cry. An Ember in the Ashes, however, made me angry. No, not angry - furious. I raged. I panicked. I hated. And damn, it was amazing.You know those rare books that just make your heart pound? Those that take you so far out of the real world that you have to remind yourself afterwards that it's all fiction, or else you won't be sleeping? For me, this was one of those books. Everything about it was gripping, from the godawful but mesmerizing setting to those two bloody love triangles (love square?). Yes, that's right. I don't even care that there were love triangles. That seems like too simplistic a term for this complex web of relationships, anyway. It isn't about choosing between hot dude #1 and hot dude #2, there's far bigger things at stake here and every character is so well-developed that you genuinely wonder and care what their fate will be.This fast-paced story is told from two perspectives. Laia is one of the Scholars - now ruled over by the Martial Empire - many of whom are poor, illiterate and even enslaved. When her brother is arrested and presumably tortured by the Masks (masked soldiers), she seeks out the Resistance for help. However, they will not help her for free and demand that in return she must enter Blackcliff Military Academy as a slave in order to spy on the Commandant. Elias - the son of the Commandant - makes up the other perspective in this book.Initially, I drew some comparisons between this and Legend, but though I liked the latter, I still don't think it's anywhere near as compelling, interesting, fast-paced or evil as this book. And despite the similar premise, this book branches off in many very different and exciting directions, including the arrival of creatures believed to only exist in myth.I mentioned my fury before and I'm going to elaborate a bit. This book is nasty. This world is nasty. The Commandant is an evil hellbitch and complete sociopath. There's torture, child abuse and the threat of rape (none of it is really graphic but it's effective just the same). But it works. The stakes are higher; it made me actually afraid for Laia when she was sneaking about and spying on the Commandant. It's hard to not grind your teeth at the unfairness and simultaneously feel powerless to stop it. It's been a while since I've read such an evocative novel.So, I enjoyed pretty much everything about this book. I liked the varied cast of characters and that Laia wasn't a typical badass heroine but a scared girl going against her every instinct to save her brother. I loved the use of prophecies and the way Elias has to try and understand what they mean in order to do the right thing. I loved the Augurs - a bunch of hooded holy men who claim to deliver prophecies. Such a great read and I can see people eating it up and being desperate for more.The book is rounded off well and is supposed to be a standalone, but there's room for more here and I'd love to see the author revisit this story and these characters. ***\n\"Life is made of so many moments that mean nothing.

The swordpoint is my priest. The dance of death is my prayer. The killing blow is my release.\nAn Ember in the Ashes is THE book I was looking most forward to in 2015. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m completely pleased with the way it turned out, because, being my most anticipated title, I naively envisioned this to be P-E-R-F-E-C-T-I-O-N or, at least, perfectly enjoyable. But, don\u2019t worry, Sabaa Tahir clearly did a fine job at putting together an intensive series of events that superbly form a story. A story that will grip.We follow the path of two main characters: Laia and Elias. Laia is a Scholar in search of her brother. This latter has been imprisoned and Laia\u2019s only goal is to free him. To do so, she aligns with the Resistance, believing they will free her brother if she helps them. Elias, on the other hand, is a Mask and the Commandant\u2019s soon. He and a few other of his \u2018\u2018rank,\u2019\u2019 need to show their skills in the trials and attempt to win them. Whoever wins will become the next emperor.\n\u2018\u2018Don\u2019t tell me you believe in myths of junn and efrits and wraiths that kidnap children in the night?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018No.\u2019\u2019 I think of the raid. Of the mark. My lightness melts away. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t need to believe in the supernatural. Not when there\u2019s worse that roams the night.\u2019\u2019\nNot bad, don\u2019t you think? I was wholly engrossed in the story. While it was slow-paced and the action not present throughout, I never felt the lack of it. A good balance was offered. Some characters were indeed shockingly pitiless or rudely villainous, some emotions so strongly raw that they had an impact on my state of mind, the atmosphere thick and oppressive\u2026 but everything was bearable and, instead of discomforting me, it made me want more. It made me want to kick some asses, to break that infectious system of theirs and hold tight to unlucky dear Laia.A love-triangle can be manageable and, under some circumstances, quite pleasurable but, two? \u2026 No, thank you. I tried to let it go. I tried to visualize it and tell myself that it\u2019s alright, that it makes sense and it\u2019s definitely justified, but I couldn\u2019t come to be fond of it. The problem, I shall tell you, is that Laia didn\u2019t make a choice. She let both guys pursue her heart. But then there\u2019s the other love-triangle. That other one \u2013 two girls for a boy \u2013 could have been avoided. It wasn\u2019t necessary to the plot. I believe a girl and a boy can truly and only be friends\u2026 sigh.\nI look up at the stars hanging low in a sky that makes me think I\u2019m seeing the infinite. But beneath their cold gaze, I feel small. All the beauty of the stars means nothing when life here on earth is so ugly.\nThe other thing is the ending. If this is a standalone set in stone really and unchangingly, it is probably the most infuriating I have ever read, because of the monumental amount of questions that remained inside my head. It would feel as if the story has been cut in two for unknown reasons. If this turns out to be the first in a new series though, it is one hell of a starter!"}, {"userName": "Kiki", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki", "userReview": "I finished this book furious: not only was it a waste of money, not only was it a waste of time, and not only was it a nonsensical clusterfuck filled with stupid, two-dimensional characters, silly romance, abominable world-building and the ghosts of like a hundred other YA dystopias/high fantasies haunting its pages, but the hype was absolutely astronomical. I have never seen a hype train like it - claims that it's the next Game of Thrones, that it's the best book of 2015, that it's life-changing. Testimonials from authors and bloggers that I love and respect had following this book around like secondhand smoke. And boy, did I buy into it. I was walking around in the book store, unsure of what to buy, when a sales associate approached me and asked if she could help. I asked her if she could recommend anything to me, and the first words from her mouth were, \"An Ember in the Ashes\".I'd heard of it, and heard of the hype, and I already loved Sabaa Tahir because she's so cool. The $29 price tag on it seemed ridiculous, but I really wanted it - damn, I really really wanted this book. I wanted this book so badly that I gave it not one but two chances to woo me. Two. That's more than a lot of books get in their lifetimes. The first time I tried to read this, I nearly died. I put it down after 204 pages because I just could feel my fucking organs shutting down. Then, six months later, for the sake of my Goodreads reading challenge, I gave it another shot. I got all the way through it this time, but I'm only angrier. Where do I even begin? With the shallow, stupid, selfish characters? The idea of creating a compelling female character who isn't kick-butt, who isn't Wonder Woman, who cries and is scared and is weak but who does the best she can with what she has, is ingenious to me. So often in YA, female protagonists are pigeon-holed as kick-butt caricatures whose only weakness is hawt boyz, but there is nothing compelling about Laia: she has the personality of a fucking doorknob. Flat, uninteresting, trite, stupid. She is so reckless, and despite growing up in an Empire where it is clear that everyone has an ulterior motive, she ignores fields of red flags, and the fact that she is being lied to over and over and over again. She knew that Mazen was contradicting himself about her brother's whereabouts, and yet...she's surprised when she finds out that he was using her? Nothing he says ever adds up. You know someone is lying to you and purposely withholding information, and sending you off on an insane mission where you're to \"prove yourself\" by becoming a slave (???) and spying on a person who has sniffed out every single prior attempt to spy on her (????) and yet you don't think there's anything untrustworthy about that?Elias is like the ancient Rome incarnation of those neck bearded dudebros on Reddit who talk about \"male brain\" and say things like \"egalitarian\" and \"ad hominem\". He is a complete tool, the most brazenly selfish character ever written. He is worse than Holden Caulfield. Time after time after bloody time he is faced with a choice between the bigger picture and his dick, and every single time he chooses his dick, no matter who will end up dead as a result, no matter how many villages and indigenous populations will burn to death now that Marcus is Emperor, no matter how many times that it is made clear his vow not to \"cross the line\" will inevitably be dragged through the mud. He is an absolute airhead: \"I am against slavery and if I become Emperor it will be within my power to abolish slavery, and I am against the killing of the Scholars, and if I become Emperor I will be able to restore human rights to the Scholars, but I will forego saving forty million lives in exchange for this one. I will allow a rapist and murderer to become a tyrant because, even after killing most of my friends, I cannot kill one girl.\"Killing Laia would have been an atrocity. But atrocities are happening, have happened, and worse ones will come to pass in the future because Elias is such a piece of shit that he would put the tent in his pants ahead of a legacy of slavery and genocide. (Do not tell me that it is his sense of human decency that stops Elias killing Laia. Elias does nothing but admire Laia in a sexually provocative context, just as he does Helene, whose every movement is punctuated by Elias's lust - his armour makes him look powerful, but Helene's makes her look beautiful! And the most important thing is beauty.) (If this, his refusal to kill Laia, was a case of his being unwilling to bring harm to an innocent, then spare a thought for the millions of innocent lives that Elias could have saved by becoming Emperor. And the millions of innocent lives that will be ruined, scarred, and ended by Marcus ascending. An ascension that Elias could have prevented.)But along that vein there's the romance: trite, pointless, devoid of feeling. It's not that I hated Keenan or Helene, it's that I didn't give a tiny rat's ass about them. They were flat, soulless characters, there only to create Very Obvious Obstacles in the Laia and Elias show, which in itself was just embarrassing. Stop awkwardly kissing, stop carrying each other around, stop mooning over each other's hot faces and pretending that any of that is grounds for a romance in which each participant would forfeit their life for the other. Laia: Elias is hot.Elias: Laia is hot.Laia/Elias (in unison): We would die for each other. Are you serious? Being willing to give your life to save someone else is completely against human nature. It is not a vow to be taken lightly. But this book does take it lightly, because every second page someone is claiming that they would give their life for someone else.And it's this sort of melodrama that robs An Ember in the Ashes of its seriousness: each and every one of the Trials was an obscene, absurd, wasteful piss-take that annihilated what small scrap of sense the world-building made in the first place. The Emperor is all-powerful, and yet he cannot stop a troupe of holy men from usurping his throne? He is assassinated by the Resistance in a mission that was, and I quote, \"too easy\". The reason why his dynasty is dying is because he has no male issue - this is specifically stated - and yet a woman, Helene, is chosen to compete in the trails?The Augurs are all-powerful holy men, and yet there is absolutely no mention of religious parameters, places of worship, dates and times of worship, or religious customs or holidays. I take this to mean that religion is not important in The Empire (the empire doesn't have a name?) and yet holy men are calling the shots...more than the Emperor?Fourteen years of training, thousands and thousands of pounds (currency is never ever mentioned, not even in passing, so values will be presented in Pounds Sterling) poured into weapons and armour and clothing and food, as well as thousands more spent on paying tutors and the Commandant, and what comes out of Blackcliff? They kill half of their student body. Young people they have spent astronomical resources on are tossed aside as if they're worthless. Are they? No, they aren't. They are an investment. How has the Empire lasted for so long if they're so incredibly clueless about managing their finances?Speaking of the Commandant, what a terrible villain. What a flat, irritating, cartoonish character. Why is she evil? Because she is. Oh, and she also wanted an abortion once! But yeah, she's a total asshole, and she kills people, and there is absolutely nothing scary about her because there is nothing human, or subversive, or nuanced about her. You can spend decades honing protagonists, but if you cheap out on your villain, then what's the point? It's like the King of Adarlan, who didn't even have a fucking name. Do not present this silly pantomime of a villain and expect her to be compelling in any way, shape or form. She was a crap character, full stop.I don't want to keep banging on about it, but seriously, guys: the world-building. It is intellectually bankrupt. No other kingdoms or empires are mentioned, so does the Empire export anything? How have they stayed afloat if they're so wasteful? What is the purpose to any of this - what is the Empire's staple? What is its industry? Currency, customs, origins, anything? I have no idea. I have no idea what the Empire is, what it's like, why it hasn't fallen like fucking Rome. Even the map is amazingly sparse. There are what, four cities? And a bunch of hamlets? Isn't this supposed to be some vast, sprawling expanse of wealth and power? It isn't. It's Blackcliff and scores of wasteland. How are the Trials, which are nothing but four giant bloodbaths, going to find a new Emperor? The Aspirants were tested on nothing but brawn and capacity to kill. They know nothing about running a country, nothing about diplomacy, nothing about managing money, nothing about conservation or land management, nothing about anything to do with being a political leader. The whole concept of the Trials was absurd and pointless. This book's one saving grace is its writing, which isn't bad. It's melodramatic and corny but it's fine. The content is what pulverizes it. It's boring, hella boring, and then it's frustrating, and then it's stuffed with gratuitous references to rape that have no emotional context. Laia is constantly being told that the students at Blackcliff will definitely rape her because she's beautiful, as if rape has anything to do with sexual desire, anything to do with the victim's beauty, anything to do with male urges and female allure. Rape is a crime of violence, power, control and subjugation, and I cannot believe that this book fumbles so spectacularly on a subject that is so precarious. This book does not have the wherewithal to deal with occupational or wartime rape with any measure of dignity or finesse, or even any humanity. This book should have left it well enough alone.I'm flabbergasted by the hype over this book, and how popular it is, and why precious few are picking it up on its derivative, contrived, infuriatingly limp content. This book, to me, was about as disappointing as it gets. I was excited to read this when it first blinked on the radar - I was excited, and I wanted to love it. But I am so let down. It was a waste of my money, and I hate saying that. But it's true. It was such a waste."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "sometimes you read a book and you know instantly - this is going to be huge. whether it's the quality of the writing, the freshness of the premise, the way it piggybacks onto something already immensely popular, or just a case of right time/right zeitgeist - you just know. and this book is going to be a star. and it should be. this book is a perfect example of crossover YA. there is nothing juvenile about it, and it will have broad appeal to adults as well as teens. it has fantastic world-building, complex characters, gripping action, it's frequently surprising, and it doesn't shy from the horrific. this book is full of hard choices and actions that can't be taken back. it is neither gentle nor pandering. from me, that is high praise - i get very fed up when books and movies resort to that lazy emotional/psychological manipulation where characters are on the brink of death but oh look! a savior! or - worse - \"ta-daaaa - we can bring people back from the dead!\" that is not to say there aren't close calls here, because there are. plenty of them. but there is always a cost to the reprieve, whether it be in corpses or sacrifices or heavy emotional baggage. the price of living is steep.this book is doing a lot of work - it's a fantasy novel, but it's also addressing very important themes of oppression, literacy as power, the dangers of history repeating itself, compassion, the distinction between loyalty and thinking for yourself, the double sidedness of power, and that \"right\" and \"wrong\" are subjective and can be a matter of perspective. it's huge, and it opens up a lot of moral dilemmas for discussion. but to backtrack before i get all bogged down in vague atmosphere, dancing around specifics - this is an incredibly strong debut historical fantasy novel. it's modeled on ancient rome, with many of the unsavory elements that entails in terms of slavery and casual rape. the rape is oft-referenced, threatened, and accepted as \"how we do,\" but there's no specific scenes on-page, which is important to note. it's always there in the background, and tahir manages to make its potential threatening enough without resorting to any gratuitous scenes of sexual assault. however, there's a ton of nonsexual bloody violence, and it's gory, powerful stuff.the story is told from two sides - laia is seventeen years old, and comes from the scholars - a formerly flourishing people now ruled by the martial empire, stripped of their power and culture, living in poverty and illiteracy. laia's family has been destroyed by the martials, specifically the masks, which are like the enforcers of the martial empire - shiny metal-masked soldiers who keep her people down through raids and brutal fear tactics. when her brother darin is arrested for treason, laia approaches the scholars' secret underground movement known as the resistance to beg for help, capitalizing on her family's past connection to the group to convince them. they agree to help, on the condition that she do her part, going undercover as a slave to the commandant of the blackcliff military academy, where the martials are trained to fight. it is an incredibly dangerous mission, and laia is such a fearful and naive girl, it seems doomed to fail, but laia is determined to rescue her brother, so into the belly of the beast she goes.the second perspective is elias, whose mother is the brutal and feared commandant herself. elias has been trained in the elite special forces division of the martials - the masks. but he didn't gain this position through nepotism - his mother despises him and abandoned him as a baby, and he spent the first six years of his life among the tribesmen who raised him before he was restored to the martials. he is now twenty, and on the verge of graduating from the masks, but he is disgusted with the brutishness of life among the martials, and is planning to desert on the eve of graduation, leaving everything behind, including his best friend helena.unfortunately, fate intervenes and elias is visited by one of the augurs, a group of men and women who are these hooded, red-eyed mystics; the keepers of prophecies, operating at a completely different level behind the scenes, manipulating the present and the future while still maintaining a remove from the fray. in my mind they are a combination ofand and elias is made an offer he cannot refuse. he, along with helena and the twins zak and marcus, has been chosen as an aspirant - to battle for the position of emperor. his first impulse is to refuse and stick with his desertion-plan, but the augur shows him a vision of his future that convinces him he needs to fulfill his destiny if he ever wants to be free from the martials.the aspirants are put to a series of trials because what would a YA dystopia be without intricate battles and tests?? (or titles like \"aspirants\" for that matter) and they are grueling. and awesome, oh, and did i mention that it's a battle to the death, and only two of them are meant to live through it - one as emperor, and one as second-in-command \"blood shrike?\" yeah, it's like that.so, while laia is enduring the cruelty of the commandant and tentatively spying and reporting back to the resistance, elias is fighting for his life in a series of escalating trials and distracted by the strange new feelings complicating his relationship with helena. a lot happens. and it's completely engrossing.my enthusiasm for reading this book could overshadow my more critical faculties and i could say \"this book is perfect!\" because it was such a breath of fresh air and a true page turner filled with truly excellent characters and unprecedentedly badass situations, but for all the impressive parts, there were some things that clashed.the commandant is just pure evil. like EEEEEEVVVIIILLLL evil evil evil. and that kind of unalloyed sadism can work in some books, but considering this one's proficiency with character-nuance, it isn't satisfying here. marcus is also pretty bad - but he's young and he wants what he wants - he is still coming up in the world and trying to prove himself. and as bad as he is, even he is given a moment or two of humanity. the commandant is someone who has all the power she needs but still takes pleasure in mutilating the truly helpless. and that kind of flat-black character is just not interesting to read about. i love that she's a woman and i love that she's tiny because that's less common in these military-YA-dystopias, but it just reads like overcompensation with the \"look how baaaad i am!\" there are no surprises in her character. she is just obstacle. my other complaint is trickier and involves the romance bits. i am never much interested in the romantic elements of these YA books, and it's what always reminds me \"this is for teenagers!\" i hate love triangles as a rule, but this book almost made me understand their appeal. there are TWO love triangles here, and while they are definitely the least interesting aspect of the book for me, i think they are handled in a more reasonable and interesting way than is typical. usually, there will be a protagonist torn between two equally attractive love interests but one is good and noble and one is baaaad but misunderstood. or they are both utter perfection and selfless and oh what a lucky girl! (because it is usually a girl) with this book, the notions of choice and destiny come into play in various ways throughout the story, with an emphasis on the impact of choice upon one's character. and as an extension of that idea, the love triangles here are less about \"which boy/girl is cuter?\" and more about the actual personalities of the participants and how they complement or complete or mirror each other, and what path choosing one over the other would lead to. and it's about making these assessments, of choosing and prioritizing what matters: a past of shared experiences or an understanding of loss, of strength or idealism or loyalty or a strength to attach to a weakness.and i think with a teen audience, when you're just starting to figure out what matters to you and who you want to be and there's still a fluidity to your personality and your future, you are in this place where all the possibilities are attractive and that makes the love triangle plausible. so thank you, this book, for making the love triangle(s) make sense. which might not seem like a complaint, but it is in the sense that while i was reading this, i did a lot of eye-rolling and \"oh, good, they are almost going to kiss again!\" so it was still a part of the book that dragged down the sophistication level for me, but it made more sense, contextually, than in most books. my last complaint is a big one, and it really depends upon whether this is a standalone book or the first in a series. when i closed this book i thought to myself, \"what a fine and stirring place to leave the reader before the action resumes in the next book.\"and then i learned that the author said:Right now, EMBER is a standalone. But I have my characters whole lives planned out, so I could write them forever.and that's unacceptable. it's not that the story feels unfinished, but it feels like a tease. there's too much that was set up here that was left unresolved. for example, throughout the book, we are given flashes of supernatural elements, and there is an expectation that these will evolve into something crucial to the plot. and they're not, not really. they are involved without being resolved. if this is all we are going to get from this world, then their inclusion is nothing but a pretty prop over in the corner, contributing little. i assumed that this would be something built up more in subsequent books, but if this is it, then i thumbs-down it as being unnecessary and distracting. and there are reunions i want to see and character arcs i require. i will not be satisfied with one story, so please - write them forever.i feel like i have blabbed on and on without saying anything, but that seems to be where i'm at right now. all i know is that i loved this book, i'm in love with helena, and if i don't get more from this world, i will be extremely unhappy.***********************************************************so i guess this one is hers now, too.\ni suppose i could go watch teevee..."}, {"userName": "Katerina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5014021-katerina", "userReview": "\u201cThe field of battle is my temple.

War, battles, trials, espionage, rebels, slaves, ruthless villains, ancient creatures of immense powers, ghouls and wraiths, unbreakable swords, all of them woven together resulted in a story that kept you on the edge, that made you hold your breath and pray that your heroes will be spared the agony and the pain that was about to come. But it wouldn't happen. They suffered, and you suffered with them. They hurt and you hurt. They were broken and you tried in vain to glue them back together. There was raw brutality that made you cringe, and strength and dedication and courage and harsh decisions that gave you goosebumps. There was hope in despair, light in darkness ,life in death. And I loved every single moment.\nThe characters\n\n\n\u201cLook at us\u201d, he says. \u201cScholar slave and Mask, each trying to persuade the other that they're not evil.\u201d\n\nTwo enemies that were never meant to cross paths, let alone find a kindred spirit in each other, Elias and Laia were two rare characters. They were driven by their passion for freedom, they felt guilty for their actions, they blamed themselves for everything that was wrong in the world. Elias was a controlled chaos, lethal but noble, while Laia was weak and scared but she recognized her fear and she tried to tame it for the sake of the people she loved. You may have heard that there is a love square in this book, but things are a little more complicated. You see, Elias and Laia don't have many scenes together. Both of them have another love interest that makes them confused, but I strongly believe they are mere distactions, a way to show that Elias and Laia come from different worlds and there are people who are more suitable for them, but the attraction and connection between them is off the charts and simply, they belong together. Which is unfortunate for me because I have a huge I want to have your babies crush on Elias.If you were patient enough to read this review, then you understand you have to drop everything you're doing and grab An Ember in the Ashes as fast as you can. Pretty pretty please?"}, {"userName": "Steph Sinclair", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4642710-steph-sinclair", "userReview": "My original review for this book consisted of the following statement:Ugh. So boring.And for some reason those three words have kinda pissed peeps off and landed me in some hot water elsewhere. But no matter. I feel like enough time has passed for me to give my true feelings. So here they are:This book is mediocre. There's nothing special about it. Nothing groundbreaking is contained in its pages. In other words, it's average. And that's what a 2 star rating for me is. I'm one of those reviewers who actually goes by the Goodreads ratings. 2 stars means I liked it, but it wasn't awesome. It also means I can see why others liked it. What it doesn't mean is that the book has no redeemable qualities or that your love for it is misplaced. I also want to point out that I really like Sabaa Tahir and have had the wonderful opportunity to meet her in person. She's truly lovely and I'm happy her novel has done so well. So take several seats if you've come here to troll me. Good day, sir. So anyway, now that that's out of the way, back to An Ember in the Ashes. Sometimes the problem with being a book blogger is that I know too much. Publishers love getting bloggers involved in campaigns to help promote their books because it's a fantastic way to generate hype and buzz for a title. Unfortunately for me, this sometimes means books are overhyped BEFORE I even get an ARC, let alone a finished copy. So the expectations I had for An Ember in the Ashes were ridiculously high and probably impossible to meet. I think my primary issue with An Ember in the Ashes is that it bit off more than it could chew and, therefore, only began to scratch the surface. The halfway developed characters made for uninteresting, multi-POV narration. Even though I listened to the audio version, it only mildly helped the situation. And usually when I run into characters who aren't fleshed out completely, there's the plot to compensate, but not even that worked for me because everything moved at a snail's pace with no clear indication which direction the finish line lay. Laia's role as a rebel was probably my least favorite aspect of the novel. Not only was she absolutely dreadful at it, but the rebels seemed shocked to find Laia hurt on a number of occasions. Things like this was worthy of an eyebrow raise because Laia was attempting to spy on the most dangerous person in the story, The Commandant, knowing that their previous spies were tortured and killed. So why are Laia's bruises a surprise? Elias' POV was no better, to be honest. He spent most of his time mulling over his constant mommy issues and romantic feelings for his best friend. So basically, it was a lot of wangst that I could have done without. Also, he pulls a bit of a dick move that momentarily made me saw red. Not to mention Elias' character arc seems to revolve around a Prophecy and I'm just kinda over that in YA right now. Still, since this is a 2-star review, there are some things that I did like. - The commandant was a fantastic character. Deliciously evil and sadistic in all the right ways. She seemed to remain the most consistent and interesting throughout the book and I found myself enjoying scenes that she cameoed in. - Elias' best friend, Helena. Even though I didn't exactly care for the romance, I enjoy the tension it created and that it caused his best friend to have more page time. She was such a badass and I loved her. Also, I started seeing some forms of a love rhombus and oh god please don't. - The battle near the end was a surprise I did not expect. Tahir ended up killing off a few side characters I didn't realize I actually cared about. The audio narration was especially wonderful during that part. All in all, it's not terrible, but also not knock-your-socks-off-amazing either. I don't feel invested enough to read the sequel since I found this one to be such a chore to get through in the first place. However, if I start seeing whispers of a Laia and Helena ship starting to form in book two, I might just need to rethink everything I thought I knew."}, {"userName": "Dana Kenedy (Dana and the Books)", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/372001-dana-kenedy-dana-and-the-books", "userReview": "This review can also be found on my blog, Dana and the Books.This book was amazing.

Who said this is a stand-alone novel?? HELLO? Did you miss that heart wrenching ending? There is no way in hell.Elias, Laia, Keenan, and Helena are are main characters. Even just these names give me goosebumps, they are just so unique! I won't be talking about the plot because i don't want anyone getting spoiled. \n\u201cWhat you want doesn\u2019t matter. Tomorrow you must make a choice. Between deserting and doing YOUR duty. If you desert, you will escape. You will leave the Empire. You will live. But you will find no solace in doing so.

You will be chained to the darkness within yourself as surely as if chained to the walls of a prison cell.\u201d\nElias Elias is a mask (a solder of the empire). First half of the book i couldn't stand him! He was lusting after his best friend Helena, he was running around whining and complaining. But he really grew on me!! Loved how he helped Laia when nobody was there for her. Laia Laia is the \"Slave girl\". Laia's story was really hard for me to read. Her parents are dead, her grandparents were slaughtered right in front of her, and her older brother (Darin) is captured by the solders. I loved Laia, she wasn't kick ass or sharp witted. She was scared but trying to be brave for her family! She was tortured, beaten, and lied to. But she didn't give up and at the end she kicked some serious ass! Couldn't be more happy! Helena Helena is Elais' best friend, the only girl mask. If Laia is too week for your taste then Helena is your girl! she is badass, strong, cold hearted, very loyal to the empire. I hated her through out the entire book. I wanted her outta the picture! I hated how she treated Laia just because she is a slave. Even though i didn't see it coming there was a reason behind everything she did. Her ending broke my heart into tiny little pieces!KeenanKeenan is with resistance, second in command! He is hands down my favorite of them all! I feel like we didn't get to see enough of him, but i liked whatever glimpse we got. I hope he is around more the in the second book.

And I won't give away more than 25% of how the story goes to avoid any spoilers.. It's a must read really.***************The World, the Setting-----------------In an Empire rules by the Martial who came from the north and invaded the Scholars\u2019 Empire 500 years ago.Scholars now live as low class citizens, forbidden of knowledge, most specifically the art of making weapons..for the only army here are the Martials.The soldiers called Masks.. the graduates from the Blackcliff, a huge dimly black Academy with the toughest military training.And Of course there's a rebel somewhere in the Empire, some say they use the huge catacombs underground..It's a Medieval Dystopia after all.With a touch of..\nSupernatural, History and Myth\nThere's a well measured use of paranormal beings here, jinn; ghosts, efrits, wraiths, and wights...they are mentioned ,maybe appear, whether they are real or not you'll learn as the story goes. Neatly and perfect.There is no magic people capable of, the only supernatural humans here are the Augurs, the holy religious undying 14 men and women.Fearful, holy and old as time..who can read the complex people's mind in a way.. who may predict the fate and the future.\n\u201cThe whites of the Augur\u2019s eyes are demon-red, vivid against his jet irises. His skin stretches across the bones of his face like a tortured body on the rack. Other than his eyes, he has no more color to him than the translucent spiders that lurk in Serra\u2019s catacombs.\u201d\n\nThe setting is one of the things that take my breath slowly, first the idea of a catacombs was haunting with the desert and the Arabian atmosphere.Then as I learn more about the Empires history with glimpses of the different other cultures there made me feel how rich it truly is. How deep and yet very easy written and calculated measured.Every bit of information about this World is smoothly produced, not interrupting the story nor fall into useless rant.-Now I rant right?, okay ..next point is.***************The Story-------LaiaA seventeen years old Scholar Girl, her grandparents killed and her older brother \u201cDarin\u201d-and only family left- captured for his sketchbook with Weapons designs by the Martial Mask soliders.She escaped, knowing that her brother work for the resistance, she try to search for them underground to help her and free him.Unfortunately for her the leader \u201cMazen\u201d gave her a mission in return for their help, to be sent as a Slave for the Commandant of the Blackcliff.To Spy on her...in the fortified Blackcliff Military Academy.\nElias\nElias, a 20 years old Martial, almost graduating as a Mask but thinking of breaking free of all this, all this brutal world of Blackcliff and the Martials Empire..But in the day of his graduation he\u2019s hold back by an Augur.. the holy man, telling him that this year there's a Tournament for 4 of the year's top graduated students.It's for a Foretold Prophecy that the line of the Emperor whose house been Emperors since the invasion 500 years ago will fail.. and the winner of the Tournament will be the New Emperor, and the second to win will be his Blood Shrike, his right hand.And since the Augurs can read minds. The Augur promised him that if he won't escape he'll be free of Body and Soul..but if he desert his soul will be even worse than a Mask\u2019s one.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Story is really convenience, hooked me from the beginning..No big coincidences or ridiculous ones. Even when I thought something went really easy, later I'd find out that's nothing easy as it seems.The story told as chapter by Laia followed by one by Elias.You won't get confused much since most of it in separated locations which make the chapters with dual narrating when they meet always fun and perfect, like in the Moon Festival scenes.Now let's review the characters -With no more rant about the story- and some of the relations.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Laia and Elias Veturius----------------I don't count it as a Love story...There's a great difference between falling in love and feeling an attraction towards the one who saves you\u2026And this novel present it very well enough. The relation between them is really smoothly moving..again can't say love but surely an attraction.Laia's 17 and truly feel that she is just her age..not ridiculously seems older nor a silly love sick girl. Just a girl faces a tough times that can happen to anyone of her faction..but she must be brave..to live up for a certain past.So is he.. he never choose to be a Mask but his past forced him..I loved how they'd met.. the small similarities between them, he wants to be Free and she's never been, and to free her brother she must to be a Slave to his Commandant..his mother..The Commandant , Keris Veturius-------------------------What a Dark, vicious character... how can she be the Mother of the brave kind soul of Elias is something thrillingly written.She's dark, holding too much of secrets and even a past encounter with Laia's family.Very powerful dark woman perfectly written and I really love this kind of characters and can't wait to know more about her.Is she totally soulless?There is a small scene I really loved from the past that will make you sure how people aren't totally beasts.. Helene Aquilla and Elias-----------------What I said about Laia and Elias doesn't fit here... and I have to say the story of Helene and Elias is one of the most beautiful hard drama love story I've read..For fourteen years they've been friends, since they were 5, grown up together, trained and fight together.The training of Blackcliff is tough, by the Augurs rule it's only males and only one female every long time..Can A Long time Friendship turns to Love?Well, sure, but how to write it...describe how the feeling can happen THAT'S the challenge..Alas, unlike the similarities between Elias and Laia, Helene character is very different.. she's tougher, she believes in rules and have a strong faith in the Augurs way more than Elias'.She'd get mad if knew that Elias even have a tiny thought to escape his duties and leave Blackcliff.The bigger problem -which I rarely read it that way but I felt really close to my real life- that he doesn't feel he love her the way she does. She's a close friend, like a relative.. which really complicating everything.There are too many secret in their relation...too many surprises and Twists of events.I really enjoyed this character and this complicated relation with all its dark sides.On the other side there's Laia and Keenan-------------Again it's brilliantly written, at first, not as falling in love rather as an attraction towards the saver\u2026Keenan is a young member of the resistance.. I liked so much how through the whole story I get these mixed feelings about him. There's a mystery around the whole resistance, there's a traitor but noone know who..You will keep thinking is he and Mazen, the old leader, are trustworthy or not.Every character got its share of secrets you peel layer by layer..but there's some untold-at least till the end of Book One- past still to discoverSuch as;The Cook and Izzi, the Kitchen slaves-----------------------------Izzi is a young kitchen girl slave, the Commandant take one eye off her as a mean to make the older slave,The Cook, suffer, though the Cook herself had her share of torment for another mysterious past with the Commandant.Izzi become a friend to Laia and though she's younger but she is a real true loyal brave friend..she help Laia whatever that may cost her\u2026which makes her a true example of Ezzat.While the Cook, though her brutal silence and disapproval of Izzi\u2019s befriending with Laia.. she proves useful giving Laia doubts about the Resistance.I really can't wait to know more about her in later books maybe.There's some more characters simply presented, richly effective in the story and the feelings.The Brutal Marcus and his twin who has a change of heart.. the loyal Sana..the Smith Spiro Teluman with his dark secrets... The Holy Augurs and their unfathomable twisted play...A Nightbringer and his Horror...Afya Ara-Nur, from a far trip with mysterious role. And many many more..~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the End--------History, Myth and other FictionSilver Masks are mentioned in many real life wars, more specifically as the Baldwin IV..the Crusaders who invade Jerusalem...Did I told you there's an Arabian atmosphere in here?Also the religious story of People connecting with Jinn and Efrits -such as Babylon mythology or many other.. is here has a specific story-like towards the end when you learn more about the history of the amazingly world created by Sabaa..It's still a pure original Novel, no matter that at some points I felt that it may have hints from A Game of Thrones...More Arabian Nights or Hunger Games even the Triwizard Tournament of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire..As I wanted to say the characters facing a \u2018Wizardry Tournament\u2019 for \u2018A Game of Thrones\u2019 in a \u2018Hunger Games\u2019 world..But what's a Great fiction if not has hints inspired by preceding great ones..and by myths and History..A Game of Thrones is inspired by the Real War of the Roses, and with Shakespeare plays. Harry Potter is heavy with Greek myths and mythology stories..Hunger Games is inspired by 1984 which is inspired by real life suppression in Soviet government.The challenge here is to Emerge bigger...with own Soul, free, unique...flame of amazing tale..not just a ranting remake blending everything...but unique as a perfect crafted Amber..hot as an Ember..An Ember in the Ashes..Thank you Sabaa Tahir,Can't wait for Book Two..Mohammed ArabeyFrom 7 May 2016To 14 May 2016PS: the photos of the Actors and Actresses are from an amazing Egyptian TV Show \"El Ahad\" written by Mohammed Amin Radi, aired June 2015.. though it's totally different story but the atmosphere even some of the characters description and even some turn of events... it's too inspired a bit by Arabian Nights.Sorry if the images may not fit well the description but again I used some imaginations.A real must read."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "If you're looking for a fantastic story full of action and adventure, 'An Ember in the Ashes' is a great place to start. There was never a dull moment in this book. Some sort of danger was always brewing and I never knew what was going to happen next.The story centers on Laia, a young lady who lives under the terrifying rule of the Martial Empire. Subjected to the tyrannical rule of the Emperor, Laia's people live in constant fear. Those who don't submit are hunted, tortured and killed. Few dare to resist.Among the most feared of the emperor's forces are the specially trained soldiers known collectively as the \"Masks\". Highly trained fighters, they are known for their skill and loyalty to the empire. They are what nightmares are made of for the oppressed scholars.When Laia's home is raided by the Masks, her grandparents are killed. Her older brother is taken as a prisoner, accused of espionage. Laia manages to escape, but lives with unbearable guilt for being such a coward.Determined to rescue her brother and make up for abandoning him at the time of his arrest, Laia sets out to find the Resistance. Whispered about, but never seen, the Resistance fighters are the only ones that can help her. After all, Laia believes that it was her brother's involvement with this group of rebels that made him a target in the first place.Once she makes contact with the Resistance leaders, she finds them reluctant to help. Finally, agreeing to place herself in the midst of the danger as a slave in exchange for breaking her brother out of prison, they reach a deal. Laia has no idea of what she's agreed to.As the new, pretty slave, Laia quickly attracts some unwanted attention. However, Elias Veturius, the son of the feared Commandant, seems to constantly come to her rescue. The two form a tenuous friendship.Elias is one of the most skilled Masks, but questions his future within the empire. He resists the loss of his soul and the bonding with his mask. Despite the darkness of the life he leads, he still has some goodness. He recognizes the evil of the empire and wants nothing more than to escape this life that he was forced into.Battles, betrayals and danger abound. I was never bored while listening to this audiobook. It kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.Although there is some romance and sweet moments, the love story is subdued. Don't expect any type of sordid love affair with this one. It just doesn't happen. However, this was still a highly entertaining and captivating story with beautiful imagery. I lost myself completely in this world and the plight of Laia and Elias. It was wonderful!

But it needed a lot of additional work to get there. The opening pages show its simplicity and lack of imagination when introducing the people. We have The Martials - a militaristic gaggle of elitist vulgarians who conquer and subjugate with glee - and The Scholars - a peaceful and learned culture currently being oppressed by the former. Laia, the female lead, is a scholar. She lives with the daily threat of being captured and sold into slavery. Her parents, who were once rebel leaders, were betrayed by their own. And yet, miraculously, this young woman is unbearably naive. Or, more like unbelievably so. You would think that her circumstances would toughen her up a little, make her guarded and wary. Slow to trust. They do not. Throughout the roughly 65% I managed to stomach, she was cowardly, weak-willed, and easily manipulated. The frustrating part is how obvious those manipulations are to the reader. And yet time and again she falls prey to the machinations of those who would use her. Which would be fine, had there been character growth. I read over half the book and saw none. Then we have Elias. He's a martial. He's a cut and paste beefcake love interest without much of a personality. There is very little show or even tell to him. He has the typical emotions we allow men to have (i.e. lust, anger , and violence and not much more), and because of this, I spent every chapter told from his perspective entirely disengaged from what was happening to and around him. On to the villians. There are many in this book. And, as a whole, they lack the shades of gray that make for truly interesting and terrifying characters. No, in this, they're all sadists, rapists, and murderers. They're almost comically bad, a parody of themselves. There are technical issues with this book as well. Poor characterization and long beats in dialogue that an editor should have done away with in the early drafts (seriously, it's editing 101 these days). Lastly, and most importantly, the overwhelming mention of rape. I've read a lot of books in the fantasy genre. Hundreds, I'd warrant. This book contains the most mentions and threats of rape that I have ever come across. I spent every chapter told through Laia's perspective waiting for the other shoe to drop. For the threats to escalate to assaults. I didn't have to wait long. I just...this is a YA novel, FFS. With a readership that is predominantly young women. And the female MC never stands up for herself or defends herself against these threats and assaults. She's caught in that vicious cycle of waiting on a man to save her from another man. This is rape culture on steroids. And it really saddens me. I hate that not only do young women have to deal with the insidious, perpetual presence of rape culture in their day to day lives (whether they realize it or not), but now they get to experience it tenfold in a book that was marketed without trigger warnings or mention of the degree of violence and sexual assault it contains.

The writing is as smooth as silk and keeps one reading long after the lights should have been out. Short chapters and the youthful viewpoints might put this book firmly in the Young Adult category. But the questions considered in this book are the very questions that must be considered as one moves into adulthood. How much should an individual be willing to suffer \u2018for the greater good?\u2019 Is it foolish to struggle if one can avoid extreme pain by accepting an oppressive system and clinging to whatever small comforts there can be in daily life? Is idealism and heroism glorious if it means sacrificing the safety of your children and loved ones?A compelling story, simply told, that considers both the cost of struggling for freedom and the price of maintaining supremacy . An Ember in the Ashes pits the false security of submission against the terrifying price of gaining choice.

The word \"good\" though, is such a small word to describe what this was. So here are a few better-fitted words to drive my point across- Amazing, alluring, addictive, awestruck, captivating, fantastic, powerful, wonderful, etc... Sabaa Tahir has created something really special here. The plot, the writing style, the world and the characters are EVERYTHING that makes a story incredible!!! The Martial Empire is a brutal dark world, a place where any form of defiance is punishable by the Commandant and usually those who are stupid enough, find themselves DEAD! Slaves are lower than dirt and are disposable. You can do whatever you like to a slave... NOTHING, I mean NOTHING is off limits! In this book, you are introduced to a world that was overtaken years ago by the Empire. It's a horrifyingly terrible place, that is run by fear and death. A world of loyalties, lines crossed, futures foretold, treachery and of course the Resistance. The heroine is Laia, she comes across as cowardice at first but eventually, she finds her inner Lioness. She is a very likable person and easy to sympathize with. The hero is Elias, and he's a mask. Masks are to be feared but Elias is different from the rest. He hates the life that was chosen for him. More than anything he just wants to be free from it all. Elias is strong and courageous. I LOVE him so so so much ;) An Ember in the Ashes surpasses all the hype and I highly recommend this book/series to everyone looking for something dark and that will draw you in completely. *This cover is beautifully done and with that title, I really had no choice but to read it!*\u201cThere are two kinds of guilt. The kind that's a burden and the kind that gives you purpose. Let your guilt be your fuel. Let it remind you of who you want to be. Draw a line in your mind. Never cross it again. You have a soul.

Don't let them take it from you.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Hailey (HaileyinBookland)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21937982-hailey-haileyinbookland", "userReview": "HOLY SHIT"}, {"userName": "Adam Silvera", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4050629-adam-silvera", "userReview": "THIS REREAD WAS EVEN MORE EPIC THAN THE FIRST READ IN 2014.

It literally crushed me when I was rejected on Edelweiss, even though I expected no other outcome. A fantasy world with a roman-esque setting? A world that was defined by its brutality and suffering? I desperately, desperately needed it; every fiber of my being demanded to consume it. Thankfully, Dahlia Adler (who's a great author so you better check her out!), generously sent me an ARC of this book, which I promptly read immediately.And thus, it is with a heavy heart for me to report that mayhaps my expectations were a bit too high. It felt like experiencing\u00a0The 5th Wave all over again. I was so excited for that book only to be sorely disappointed. Yeah, I ended up eating ice cream that day to drown away my sorrows...\nWarning\n: this is a lengthy review as there were so many things I needed to say and expound, but there is a TL;DR section below if you want a summarized version.Don't get me wrong,\u00a0An Ember in the Ashes\u00a0has a lot of things going for it. For one, this book definitely doesn't hold itself back when it comes to brutality. The book keeps reminding us how awful the Empire is - they indiscriminately kill the Scholars just for offending them, they forbid reading, they pillage and rape. But... that's the thing. The narrators keep\u00a0telling\u00a0us that. It felt that we only know it's brutal mainly because we're constantly reminded that it is without actually showing us how, except for that one time in the beginning of the book where people close to the MC were mercilessly killed. We're so limited to what our two main characters feel and see in their first-person POVs that the rest of the world was left out. I mean, aside from the book being \"roman-esque\", I didn't\u00a0even know what the world around them\u00a0really looked\u00a0like. I didn't\u00a0know the architecture, I didn't\u00a0know what was going on in the streets, I didn't\u00a0see how\u00a0Scholars were being maltreated - just pure telling that this is so.Which is honestly a shame, because this is a\u00a0fantasy. The world is important. Setting the atmosphere and the environment is vital.\u00a0I\u00a0need to visualize everything, see the brutality and feel it for myself, in order to be emotionally invested in the plight. But it simply wasn't there.\u00a0The world was nonexistent, and I'm left with nothing concrete to imagine.Let's get back to its being brutal. While I don't mind brutality in a world, I do have an issue about rape being used to make it darker and grittier. The MC keeps getting reminded (and reminding us in turn) that she was too pretty, that she needed to be careful as the students in Blackcliffe were known for simply taking slave girls for a night of pleasure. It really bothered me that it kept getting emphasized in order to set a certain tone. Not to mention, using it as plot devices to move the story along.\u00a0An antagonist takes an interest in the MC and physically assaults her with the intention of raping her, she screams, so here comes the love interest to the rescue. Another antagonist is about the catch the two idling about, and so he pretends to rape her in order to \"save her from the antagonist's wrath\", and I was just appalled. I just couldn't wrap around my head\u00a0why this had to be done when there were other ways to go about this, which made me think if it really were necessary to go this far, and if this theme is more \"tolerable\" in a fantasy setting (since it's supposedly a \"part of the world\").\u00a0In any case, I didn't like how it was used so casually and\u00a0repeatedly.And there's the issue of the narration in general. The characters here take more on a passive role than an active role, as their actions are dependent on what is happening around them. It was definitely interesting to see how they would react to the things outside their control and how they would cope with it, but it definitely did not leave enough room for character development. Objectively, the characters were complex in their own ways. Laia wants to save her brother through the Resistance, and is forced to spy for them in order to convince them to help her. She is weak and admits it, but must gather her courage to help Darin. Elias, on the other hand, wants out of the vicious system, but is forced back by a mysterious third party in order to vie for the crown. He wants to make a change somehow but is chained by his duty and his friends who think differently.\u00a0Subjectively, I just couldn't really care for them that much because of the lack of intimate internal narration.\u00a0I mean, their POVs were\u00a0so telling than showing, resulting to a narration that was flat and somehow simplistic... it isn't\u00a0a surprise this is how it ended up for me.One thing that I really, really, really liked though was the ending, because that was when the characters decided to do something for themselves rather than wait for things to happen to them, and it was fun (and intense) from then on out.\u00a0Fair warning, however, this book is for now a standalone, and the ending does feel incomplete somehow. The problem by the end is not yet resolved, and there are hints that our two main characters will eventually do something about it, but a sequel is uncertain as of now, so... yeah. Just putting it out there.OVERALL (a tl;dr if you didn't feel like reading my ramblings)1.) The world-building is definitely lacking. The telling than showing style makes the setting a little blurry, which was a monumental disappointment.2.) There is a fair amount of brutality here. While that's not really an issue in and of itself, the constant use of rape to set the tone in the story was problematic for me. Plus, its use as a plot device to move the story... no. That\u00a0just didn't work for me.3.) The characters have passive roles which really limited their development. Their actions are so dependent on the plot, and that fact that their stories were told in such a \"telling than showing\" style\u00a0made the narration flat and the connection nonexistent.4.) The ending was cool, though. Look forward to that, but it does end in a cliffhanger.Although keep in mind that this is a single opinion only. If you look around, there are waves of positive reviews circling this book, so don't let my review discourage you from checking this out. Who knows, the things I mentioned wouldn't bother you as much and you'll end up loving it! :)"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44125660-beth", "userReview": "\"There are two kinds of guilt.

I can't believe it has taken me this long to actually read it! An Ember in the Ashes has been on my bookshelf for the longest time, and I got a message from Fathima being like, we should Buddy Read this, and me being the utter fool I am was HESITANT! However this was so unexpected and now it's one of my new favourites and I could cry with happiness, because of how much I loved this, but I'll stop rambling and try and write a review, even though in my head I'm thinking I need A Torch Against the Night right now. Also I'm just throwing it out there this is the BEST Buddy Read I've done with Fathima this year, we finished it pretty much at the exact same time! It's a miracle! I'm just going to throw it out there, by the first chapter I was already drawn in. It was so intense and so much seemed to be happening! I found the book so easy to follow, and things were fast paced, but didn't seem to miss anything. The character building was done so well and it keeps you second guessing things (which is always a plus). Whenever I picked up the book my heart would not stop going, like I was worried for my characters here! It's one of those books where you're saying to yourself Just one more chapter... 10 chapters later and your mind is blown! There was always something happening, building or relationships, The Trials, secrecy, cunning characters, wicked characters, mystical things that shouldn't be there. I was just so blown away by everything.\"Fear can be good, Laia. It can keep you alive. But don't let it control you. Don't let it show doubts within you. When the fear takes over, use the only thing more powerful, more indestructible, to fight it: your spirit. Your heart.\"Characters This is going to be a hot mess...Firstly we have Laia in the first few chapters we see her whole world turn upside down, I initially didn't know what to actually think of her, however as the story progressed I actually enjoyed her character so much more than what I thought! We see her go from someone who seems quite timid, go to great lengths to do what she believes is right. I like how strong willed she is, that she tries to defend herself, we see her open up and question things she knows is wrong. Something that I really really really enjoyed was her friendship with Izzi (and also Cook kind of?!) it was see them both come together and see what they can do to help each other out.Here is where it may become me just raving on and on about my new book love Elias... oh my. I think I have come to the point where I can hold my hands up and say I am in a new set of crazy with how much I love Elias! We see him challenge things he knows are wrong. Everything that he's supposed to be, he detests, even with his friends he asks questions and wants them to know that what they do is wrong. I loved the idea of his Mask and how it doesn't set on his face like the others, his struggles he goes through and that he stands up for what is right. At times I felt like he was my knight in shining armour... I know, I know. I can't help but swoon right now. My poor little heart couldn't take those last few chapters!Teeny tiny shout out to Helene I have no idea what to think right now... all the way hrough I was asking myself do I actually like her (I still don't know the answer to this) but I know why she is like she is, and I'm so intrigued by many many things! I'm looking forward to reading about her in the next book!What I liked?- I have a soft spot for Izzi and Cook, and I need to know EVERYTHING, back stories included.- TRIALS! Those trials were so good! The third one, I was like fuuuuuuuuuck! Then in the 4th one I was doing the same!- CHAPTER 41 STOLE MY HEART, I don't care, I loved it!- Cooks story for Laia- Elias... you know I have heart eyes for you.- All of the unanswered questions!- The fact that I had no clue who would win the Trials.- The bad characters are sooooooo evil and I just love it!- When it was the moon party, there was such freedom and joy, my heart was just so happy.I honestly didn't dislike anythingOverall, this is clearly a new favourite of mine. I can't wait to Buddy Read A Torch Against The Night, if my ship doesn't sail I'm coming for you Sabaa Tahir. But seriously I have no clue what's going to happen, I feel so happy that I read this and I need answers!I thought I'd listen to the audiobook seen as though A Reaper at the Gates is out in just over a month, even though I read this literally 4 months ago... yep I did that. So some thoughts I picked up this time around:- I actually liked Helene a lot more, I think it was easier to see her thought process a second time around and I didn't give her enough credit, my eyes were focused elsewhere.- There's some very subtle things I hadn't noticed before-Keenan still annoyed me- The commandant is just so evil, and I like itttt!- Kind of wanting to know more about the Auras- ELIAS IS STILL SO PRECIOUS AND I LOVE HIM- Ship needs to sail.- It's just as good re-reading as when I first read it.I love this series.An Ember in the Ashes - 5 Stars!A Torch Against The Night - 5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "Who\u2019s excited for  A Torch Against the Night in August? I know I am, that much so I thought I\u2019d revisit this review. This was such an eloquently written book, one that's left me in suspense for an entire year. I actually surprised myself with this. I didn't think I'd like it as much. Whenever I read novels like this there is normally some really annoying feature that irks me so much that I end up hating the book. With this, however, I have no criticisms. I literally have nothing bad to say about this book at all. It\u2019s well written, with great characters and it has a really interesting plot. I know that sounds like a generic thing to say in a book review, but it\u2019s completely true. I loved how the author drew on aspects of Ancient Rome as well.  An oppressive empire Indeed, the world is ruled by a Rome like empire; they have crushed nations to dust and lorded over the survivors. The Scholars were once a nation of thinkers and philosophers; they had no war machine, so were quickly destroyed by the approaching empire. They are now slaves and labourers rather than the once illustrious mathematicians and painters they were. Laia is a decedent of the scholar nation, and her brother is in an underground organisation that seeks to destroy their overseers. One day her family is brutally attacked and he is taken prisoner. He is taken by a Mask. Masks are elite solders of the empire, and are handpicked for their loyalty, and ruthlessness, in defence of the Empire. Laia gets into contact with the organisation that her brother was working for. They agree to help her, but only if she spies for them. She has to pretend to be a slave. They ship her off to spy on the coldest hearted bitch I have ever encountered in a novel. This woman is literally one of the most awful fictional characters in existence. But, I think there is a secret reason for it, and she may nasty for a purpose. I\u2019m not sure yet, but I do hope to find out in the future. This woman is terrible, and Laia is almost entirely alone in the camp she is set to spy on. One friendly mask In the depths of malicious soldiers and arrogant men there is one man that despises himself more than any despise the empire he belongs to. His name is Elias, and he is a mask. His mother is, unfortunately, that cold hearted bitch I mentioned earlier. This leads to a tone of character expectation for Elias, and he doesn\u2019t meet any of them. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be like his mother, but he\u2019s not. He longs to escape from the Empire; he sees it for what it is. He has only been pretending to be part of this brutal and oppressive regime. However, his dreams are cut short as he is forced into a fight for the Emperorship. Escape now seems even more unlikely; his life is a constant burden as there is no hope left for him until one day a girl posing as a slave enters the camp. This really was a fantastic book. The writing was very precise and the plot was such a great idea. I do think Elias was a fool though. I know Helene was in the friend zone, but surely he saw what was front of his face? She was too good for him anyway, but still he practically had a goddess fawning over him. What a fool. Furthermore, this novel could have quite easily been set in any era, and in all honesty I do think I enjoyed it more because it was set in an Ancient Rome style world. I can\u2019t wait to see what the author will do with the sequel. Overall, a strong four stars."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "Nope.I know Sabaa Tahir hardly received any criticism and absolutely everybody is amazed.Not me.I'm the opposite of amazed.For starters, the concept is ancient.

There is a trial where the competitors have to fight until only one survives.Much creative.Still, some authors are able to work out a thrilling story. Sabaa Tahir was not.Next thing, the characters are shallow. There is no character depth in Laia, nor Elias, nor in anyone else. They were one-dimensional and their heavy guilt and sorrow bored me to death. Don't even get me started on predictability.Everything just felt absolutely unrealistic to me. The poor world building and the fast paced plot only made it worse. I couldn't get into it, but I really hate not finishing novels. I know this is a debut novel, but sadly it also reads like one.I don't understand this hype, this rating, this book.
