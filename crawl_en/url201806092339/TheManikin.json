This book seems to have woven in some bits and pieces of that book, and in some instances, some pieces of the Bronte sisters' concept of the empowered houseworker-turned-lover, and well, you know the end. Except that the ending here is a bit twisted, which makes for a good concept, yet not one that is well-developed. A white owl meets a tragic end in the beginning and this is foreshadow of bad things to come. In a country mansion, a dutiful housekeeper takes care of her dying boss, whose husband has died and whose son has betrayed her. The house's employees hang on to their jobs as lifelines - each has his or her meaningful backstory. Soon, Liliane, a family friend and beautiful young woman comes to live at The Manikin. Peg, the housekeeper's daughter, is attracted to her. You would think this all sounds alluringly layered. Yet so many things happen at once. So many characters fight for the position of main character. Story intimacy becomes elusive. The prose is sharp, but too rehearsed that it appears in various points of views, with a few narrative voices intertwined, so that plot development and style competes and unfortunately, style takes precedence. The plot meanders, towards the second half, in a way that seems rushed. This book was a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, and in some way what it set out to achieve is unique. But if my thoughts seem rushed and unlike my regular reviews, it is because this just wasn't the read for me."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1368291-sarah", "userReview": "One of my all-time favorites.

Mary Craxton leaves there, even though she never really wanted to, while her husband is dead and her remaining son, Henry Craxton Jr. is away from her, travelling the world. The family has got its money from taxidermy, since Craxton Institute is supplying the natural history museums with its showpieces. This is the story of the decline of that family, and the rise of its servants, especially the housekeeper Ellen and her daughter Peg.The story begins with the northern owl travelling over the Craxton Lake. Later on, this owl is shot by the houseman's son, and becomes a showpiece itself. This happens a little before window Mary Craxton dies and her son returns to find that she's left everything to charity. The servants hate Henry Craxton who decides to take what is rightfully his by law. The have every right to do so, as he is a sin that never loved his mother and has the worst manners ever, especially when it comes to them.Joanna Scott wrote a book, finalist to the 1997 Pulitzer prize. The characters are deep, with emotions, described in a poetic way. The setting is a romantic one, and the description of the nature flows seamlessly as the story proceeds. Love and passion are in the air, all inside the mansion and its surroundings. Words untold, remaining in the minds of the characters. Discussions that never took place between a mother and a daughter, a woman and a man. Heroes of the small things."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3078907-sharon", "userReview": "From page 65:\"Snow at last. True snow. Not the furtive or dishonest snow that has started and stopped and started again for weeks. Not the meanspiriteed, sleety snow or the snow that coats the trees with ice. This is snow that gains in bulk and weight with astonishing speed, snow that transforms the forest within minutes into a whitewashed maze of compartments and aisles, snow that lands in tempting dollops on the tiny red berries of the bitter nightshade, snow that stick so the hairpin edges of rhododendron leaves, snow that skews; perspective, making even the tress close by wave like seagrass. It is not yet the harsh sow with blizzard winds that sweeps south from Canada. This is snow that seems indigenous, falling vertically with a soft hiss, gathering in mounds shaped by the contours of the earth. It is a snow that marks the beginning of winter. A snow that buries.\""}, {"userName": "Beth G", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4838459-beth-g", "userReview": "It is easy to see why this book was a finalist for the Pulitizer Prize. Joanna Scott is a talented writer who weaves a haunting tale of a home in the late 19th century. Oddly enough a wax work company in Portsmouth, NH is referred to in part of the story.

Enraged by the alleged rape, black and white form an alliance against The Man, forcing Craxton to flee, and temporarily set up some kind of egalitarian anarchic commune in the Big House.

The Manikin is a house, named for the flexible skeleton in a taxidermied animal, built by a man dedicated to the unnatural preservation of natural history. With that complex metaphor at its center, the story is about the secrets in old families, class struggle, portents, magic of a sort, and much more. Ms. Scott's writing is beautiful, even when it's telling the darkest of tales. I liked the first two-thirds of the book but thought it wandered a bit near the end. Still, I can't say I've ever read anything quite like it and would recommend it to anyone with a taste for a smart take on a crumbling, haunted genre."}, {"userName": "Her Royal Orangeness", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4708779-her-royal-orangeness", "userReview": "\"The Manikin\" is similar in style to two other Pulitzer nominees I've read recently - The Plague of Doves and Evidence of Things Unseen. Lyrical writing, strong sense of time and place, large cast of characters, almost excessive information that isn't exactly related to the plot. The thing I most disliked about \"The Manikin\" was the third-person omniscient narrative. While it is understandably necessary for the way the novel is constructed, it made the characters feel one-dimensional. I did not like being told what the characters were doing and thinking and feeling...I wanted to experience those things through them. There was also something about the writing style that detracted from the creepy/gothic element, like the difference between going to a haunted house and being told about someone else's trip to a haunted house.\"The Manikin\" is just an okay book. I would not enthusiastically recommend it to anyone."}, {"userName": "Miriam Fitting", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1197037-miriam-fitting", "userReview": "A manor house in the northern Hudson Valley is owned by a family that got its money from taxidermy: the Caxtons. This is the story of the decline of that family, and the rise of its servants, especially the housekeeper Ellen and her daughter Peg. The story has a frame of the present, during which the ruined and abandoned house is being restored by the townspeople in an attempt to attract tourists. Most of it takes place 30-50 years before, though, when the widow of the original Caxton owner, who was keeping the house together through spite and force of will, declines and dies, and her son returns to find she's left everything to charity. The servants revolt and throw him out when they find/think that he's raped 16-year-old Peg, and Ellen ends up marrying the head gameskeeper and they live happily ever after. Lyrical prose, evocative images, slightly annoying occasionally in the length of the flights of fancy and overinterpretation of the significance and possible reactions of the characters. Mohawnk House the genesis, perhaps?"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3450906-carol", "userReview": "This novel concerns the people living in a mansion in upstate New York during the 1920s. It was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1997, a fact which suprises me, because I found the book disappointing. The setting is a rather eccentric place - a mansion built out in the middle of nowhere and filled with the archaeological and natural history artifacts collected by its deceased builder. Yet the plot and characters fall flat, never delivering on the promise of such a fascinating setting. The only thing that kept me reading was Scott's flair for gorgeously lyrical descriptive language. She should be a poet rather than a novelist."}, {"userName": "Joette", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1905419-joette", "userReview": "I didn't love this book. In fact, I paged through several parts of it just to see what happened at the end. I thought she gave too many details in many parts.
