However, re-reading is a futile exercise, not only can I not connect with that inner child, I don\u2019t even know who she was anymore. She is a stranger to me. Still I\u2019m reading those books to see if through them I can at least catch a glimpse of that foreign girl who grew up to be me, so that I assure myself of the continuity of my own self. The fourteen-year-old me LOVED Andre Norton. The fourteen-year-old me didn\u2019t even realise Andre Norton was a woman but she didn\u2019t much care. She was excited over the trashy covers with half naked women and buff guys, often accompanied by dangerous wild animals. What kind of titillation she was getting out of the books? I am not and never have been a particularly introspective kind of person. My diaries just talk about what happened, often in a funny way but hardly ever about how I felt any of that. And I am not any smarter after re-reading Witch World. This was a lot less sexy than I remember but it is entirely possible I had never read this particular instalment of the series. I read them out of order, based on whatever was available in the library at the time. I just remember when I borrowed my first one I was afraid the librarian wouldn\u2019t let me take it home because there was a woman on the cover with very little clothing. (http://www.bookhunter.pl/okladki/9259... I think this might\u2019ve been the one).Have I ever read the very beginning of the series? Did I even know how it started? Did I know that it started in our world with Simon, a WWII veteran who got himself in a pickle and was looking for a way out and he got maybe a little more than he bargained for when he got teleported into an entire different world of magic and whatnot?From then on the book takes place mostly in Etscarp \u2013 the feminine land ruled by benevolent, wise witches, facing threats from all sides, but mostly from Kolder \u2013 the land representing technology gone rogue and masculine ruthlessness. Our hero, Simon, finds himself helping defend Etscarp and discovering his feminine side.Norton was trying to do some interesting gender things in her series (or at least interesting at the time), she was a proto-Le Guin if you excuse the comparison. It is sad to think that the concepts here were revolutionary mere 50 years ago. There is a lot of female power/magic, which unfortunately goes when they lose virginity (barf, how I hate anything that makes female virginity into a thing), but at least that means the main character couldn\u2019t go round screwing every woman he meets which is what happens in other fantasy books. Of course that means the only way to disarm a witch, conquer her, was to rape her \u2013 which is spot-on the main thing about rape, it\u2019s never about sex, but about power. And if a witch decides to marry and give herself to a man, she essentially relinquishes her power. So that\u2019s why things get interesting when Simon discovers he might have some magic powers of his own. Will they go away if gets laid? Unfortunately I will never find out because I won\u2019t rush to re-read the remainder of the series. There is not enough world building and character development for my liking and the ending is a bit anticlimactic. Therefore I\u2019m leaving those books where they belong \u2013 with my 14 year old self."}, {"userName": "Kat  Hooper", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2177891-kat-hooper", "userReview": "ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature.Simon Tregarth knows he\u2019s about to die \u2014 he\u2019s being hunted down by a professional assassin and he has a \u201cfeeling\u201d that it\u2019s going to happen tonight. But then the infamous Doctor Petronius interrupts Simon as he\u2019s savoring his last meal and offers him an escape. Dr. Petronius\u2019s services don\u2019t come cheap, but this expense is a no-brainer (after all, you can\u2019t take it with you). The only downside is that neither Simon nor Dr. Petronius knows where Simon is actually going, for he will sit on King Arthur\u2019s Siege Perilous and be sent to a world where his soul is at home\u2026Andre Norton (her real name was Alice, but she chose to write SFF under a male pseudonym back in the 60s) is often called the Grande Dame of Science Fiction and Fantasy and was the first woman to receive the Gandalf Grand Master Award from the World Science Fiction Society. I\u2019ve been meaning to read Witch World for years and since Brilliance Audio has just released the first Witch World novel on CD, this was the perfect opportunity.As expected, I enjoyed Witch World. Andre Norton\u2019s language is pleasant, if not brilliant, and all the characters were instantly engaging. I liked Simon immediately \u2014 how can you not like a guy who has already killed two of his potential assassins and is now eating a steak dinner while waiting for the arrival of the last and best one? I also particularly liked Loyse, daughter of the odious Fulk, who doesn\u2019t want to marry the equally odious duke.Though decades old, the plot was quick, fun, and refreshing and I liked the blend of science fiction and fantasy. However, the book wraps up a bit too quickly and easily at the end; I could have used a bit more tension. But perhaps if you go straight on to the next novel (Web of the Witch World, also being produced on audio) you won\u2019t feel this way since it\u2019s a continuation of the story.Nick Podehl was the reader for this book and he did an adequate job, though his voice could sometimes be described as plodding and soporific. Consequently, I didn\u2019t find that his reading added anything to the story. It didn\u2019t reduce my enjoyment of the story, but I was disappointed that it didn\u2019t enhance it.I\u2019m looking forward to Web of the Witch World.

The top floor catered to \"adult\" literature and I didn't often go there. The basement contained the YA and SF stuff, and it was there that I received my first exposure to the genre that I love to this day. Andre Norton was one of the earliest authors I read. The library had two five-book collections of her work. The first were SF titles - the first two or three \"Solar Queen\" novels and a few more set in her future history. The second collection were the first five \"Witch World\" novels - the setting for much of Norton's most inspired and best work.What makes Norton such a wonderful author - something I only recognize in hindsight but that I'd like to think my adolescent subconscious picked up on - is that she never allows her fantastical settings to obscure what really matters: the people who live in her stories. The story of Simon Tregarth's adventures in the service of Estcarp made a powerful impression on me, and Jaelithe was probably my first literary crush. For a long time, it was Norton and Tolkien by which I measured other authors.My recommendation below still stands. For decent stories with interesting and admirable characters, you can do far worse.___________________________________________________________Andre Norton is probably one of the best authors to introduce young readers to both SF and fantasy. You can't go far wrong with either the Solar Queen or the Witch World.* For my birthday, I picked up the first seven \"Witch World\" novels from my local used-book store, which prompted this particular round of rereading."}, {"userName": "Sable", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7673930-sable", "userReview": "[She escapes an arranged marriage to claim her title and inheritance as Fulk's only child to take up the life of a warrior maid, at first disguising herself as a young man to do so.

A marked man, Simon, who is or once was very capable, and once honest and a Corporal, is on the run. He expects death at every turn, and yet is still darkly witty when prompted. Having been tricked into falling on the wrong side of the law he has had to leave his old life behind him, and has so far managed to beat off those who come after him... but he finds himself following someone expensively dangerous who says he can be of some assistance - and that assistance has to do with Simon's Cornish heritage.This reminds me hugely of Outlander by Diana Gabaldon for various reasons (though Estcarp Cycle came first, of course) as well as the many many other 'MC gets transported to a magical land by various means and has to struggle on' books out there. The general interactions at the start of the book, the light worldbuilding, and leaving the reader to make their own inferring makes this a strong book as it keeps you paying attention. The fact women are those who have magic is always a favourite of mine - turning often weaker characters who just gather herbs or sit and worry a force to be reckoned with. Overall though, the intrigue from the start kind of set me off to expect an entirely different book, and this was a mainly plot driven piece rather than by character or worldbuilding as is my preference. This is an interesting book to read for its time, and to enjoy the genre as it once was, but overall it wasn't as for me as I'd previously hoped."}, {"userName": "the gift", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3403278-the-gift", "userReview": "continuing my reading of woman-authored pulp/golden age sff: just recalled reading this many years ago (decades...) and found i had not put this on here. i remember this was one of the first 'portal fantasies' i read, though not new at the time. and this world of witches is feminist in early sff way. i did enjoy it though i do not know if i was 17 or more, but obviously not enough to follow sequels..."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15496516-kathryn", "userReview": "This is the first of the Witch World books and a classic. To be honest, most of the spec-fic classics I've read lately have been fairly disappointing. I thought this one bucked the trend and held up fairly well. Overall I'd give it a 3.5, rounding up for it being a classic.We open with Simon Tregarth, our protagonist, on the run in a distinctly noir setting. It has a 1940s feel to it which probably felt like the nearly recent past when the book was released in 1963. Anyhow, we don't spend too much time in the 40s, as Simon escapes the people pursuing him by striking a deal with a shady character who promises him a portal to the world where he truly belongs. And off we go with our traditional portal fantasy!Simon finds himself in a new world and immediately sees a person on the run from pursuers. Jumping in without knowing what's going on he helps the woman hide from her pursuers. This ends up working out for him as this in turn allows him a time and place to learn the language of his new land and find a place there. The book pretty much skips over those details!The rest of the book primarily features Simon, the lady he rescued whose name we don't find out til the end, Koris (a dwarf who ends up a Captain in the guards), and Loyse, the heir to another kingdom who is desperate to escape her father's (stepfather's?) plans for her. There's quite a few small kingdoms with roughly described politics and stances and a lot of battle scenes. There's a bit of dipping into sci-fantasy with some interesting technology cropping up unexpectedly. There are psuedo-zombies and talking birds. The book covers an awful lot of ground, some of it well, some if not so well. Mostly it's a fun ride. It definitely has a lot of the feel of the pulp adventures that preceded it. For a book of its era, I appreciate the balance of male and female characters and that the women had some agency. It's also nice to read one of the grand doyennes of fantasy!"}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1769635-derek", "userReview": "I had forgotten how comprehensive and detailed this story is, and how the base premise blossoms out into an array of consequences, implications, derivations, and plot hooks. You consider the idea of \"matriarchy, magic powers require virginity\" and see how this plays off a nearby machismo-based society, or how it affects political relations with neighbors either jealous or fearful of their power, or even showing how the idea of \"women with power will probably not have children\" will affect population growth.Even relative subplots like the inheritance of Verlaine and the Duke's ambitions for a trading port are developed into something that in other hands would consume an entire novel.This is not simple sword-and-sorcery: the Witch World is a strange mix of the magical/psychic, the medieval, and the supertechnological, all carefully thought out, and, at least in the early novels of the series, more similar to Barsoom than anything else.It's easy to see how this one book sprung into the sprawling series and offshoot series. The conclusion is deliberately open-ended, with further problems for Estcarp to wrestle. Not just the Kolder war or the fractious neighbor states, but there are challenges to redefine its own culture and its relations to, say, the Falconers.

I decided to try her out after learning she is considered part of an almost forgotten triumvirate of women who were instrumental in developing science fiction and fantasy as it is today: Anne McCaffrey, C J Cherryh, and Andre Norton. I have read almost everything by Anne McCaffrey but until now nothing by the other two.Another notable aspect of the three groundbreaking women is they felt no compunction about combining science fiction and fantasy in the same novels, something that had been a purist taboo. N K Jemisin, Charlie Jane Anders, Neal Stephenson and other current authors also combine magic and science. I like that.Witch World begins with Simon Tregarth, a disgraced former Colonel in the World War II US Army, who is on the run. He meets a benefactor who escorts him through a portal into Witch World. Simon finds himself in this world of witches, decayed and super advanced science, and political intrigue. He knows none of the languages spoken there but aligns himself with one of the factions in its long running conflicts. As he fights with them he has to prove himself at every turn since he is from another world and they don't completely trust him at first. The reader shares his confusion for most of the book as he learns about his new world as he goes. Having recently read both The Fifth Season and The Obelisk Gate by N K Jemisin, I was fairly accustomed to a good deal of confusion, so I proceeded, if slowly. By the end of the book I was hooked as well as oriented and amazed.I could say more about the plot but I will just be dastardly and let you suffer through as I did. Simon Tregarth is a fabulous character. So are the witches.I do love and admire Anne McCaffrey (whom I met twice) but Andre Norton is a much more sophisticated world builder, perhaps a bridge between McCaffrey and the sadly, recently departed Ursula LeGuin.

With the incentive of various challenges to encourage me, I finally decided to see if it lived up to its Hugo Award nomination. I am pleased to say that, unlike A Wizard of Earthsea, it seems to deserve its place on all those \u2018Top Fantasy Series\u2019 lists out there. It does feel a little dated now, but it is fifty years old, so that is hardly surprising. The Witch World itself is lavishly detailed and totally developed. We experience a series of very different cultures and societies, but they are not presented via a mass of exposition. If anything, I would have liked some more detail and perhaps a little longer to immerse myself in each one before we moved on to the next. This was definitely a book that would have benefitted from a good glossary or appendix explaining some of the terms and concepts as it was a little too light on explanations for my taste.This brings us to one aspect of the world that I really did enjoy: the magic. For some reason it is confined to women, thus making them a powerful force in society, which was a very nice change for a society that was basically your typical Medieval European fantasy setting. I also liked the way that the magic was mind-based and more to do with mental discipline and good luck than anything else. This fallibility was also a nice deviation from the usual whizz, bang, point and shoot type of magic that we see so often. It also meant that the Witches had to work together with their male army in order to really accomplish anything, showing a fairly equal society in many aspects. This equality was even highlighted by the disapproval that they felt for the Falconers\u2019 society, which was male-dominated and used their women as breeding machines."}, {"userName": "Metaphorosis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7706283-metaphorosis", "userReview": "reviews.metaphorosis.com 2.5 starsSimon Tregarth, hunted and tired, pays all he has for a guaranteed escape.

I knew about the Witch World, but I just wasn't very interested. Decades later, I decided to give her another try. I read the Time Traders series (with various co-authors), and wasn't impressed, but I figured that it was the Witch World books that were what she was best known for.I'm sorry to say I didn't think much of this first book in the series. It starts well, with intriguing, gritty streets and an act of desperation. Then there's a reasonably standard (for the period) man saves woman, becomes champion scenario. The book then turns to a mix of interesting concepts, and I give it credit for interesting cultures and an interesting approach to multi-dimensional trade. Where it is weaker is in the human relationships. Our hero, Simon, while shown to be intelligent and resourceful, rarely shows much initiative. He wanders hither and thither as the plot requires, with no real interests of his own. He's a mechanism, not a character.Unfortunately, I had a similar reaction to the Time Traders series - thinly sketched, not very credible action heroes in 'luckily it all worked out' situations. In this novel, the environment and plot were more interesting, but I think what eight books tells me is that I just don't care much for Norton's work.

I don't know how I came to review another edition. With Norton's books, what matters about editions is mostly the cover picture. The one on this edition (the 1966 edition) is puzzling. It depicts a helmeted man (?A Falconer?) with a distorted face--not scarred, I think, but perhaps affected by a stroke?No such character occurs in this volume, and it's not clear where the (uncredited, as far as I can discern) artist got the idea from. On the back cover is another picture, of a woman (? a witch? or maybe the Lady Aldis of Karsten?) with long flowing hair.This is the seminal work of the Witch World series. Norton commented in at least one collection that it was intended as a one-off, and just caught people's imagination to a much greater extent than other series of Norton's.As with other books from 1966 (cf James White's The Watch Below), this book is still in the penumbra of WWII. Simon Tregarth (whose history is somewhat elided in later books) begins as a spy on the run--a man who, encountering corruption, refused to look the other way, and fell afoul of the allies of the corrupt parties. The book begins with his introduction to Jorge Petronius, who offers Simon a chance to sit in the Siege Perilous, which activates a gate to take the sitter to a world attuned to his (? or her?) spirit.The book is a tetrad, with continuing characters moved to new scenes, new characters introduced, etc. Each chapter also has its own title. Summaries follow:PART I VENTURE OUT OF SULCARKEEP: Chapter I: Siege Perilous: Set in an unnamed city (the implication is that it's in Britain). Simon Tregarth is not sure he can trust Jorge Petronius. But has he any choice?Chapter II: Moor Hunt: Norton later realized that the witches can't just be nameless. I mean, what if you're dealing with dozens of witches? How do you indicate which one you want to ask a question of?The vulnerable part is the formal name, anyway. So at a later time, witches are given nicknames. In this case, Simon meets, near the gate, a witch who was on a spying mission into Alizon. It's never really made clear why she thought she could be undetected, or what she was trying to achieve. Nor, for that matter, is it clear why the people of Tormarsh tried to keep aloof from the affairs of their neighbors. This chapter also introduces Koris of Gorm, whose mother was of Tormarsh herself.Chapter III: Simon Takes Service: The men who served at the pleasure of the Witches' Council in Estcarp are mostly the offspring of Untalented Estcarpian women. But there seems to be a sort of Foreign Legion, comprising men of other ethnicities. Or else the outlanders are incorporated into the regular troops. It's not clear, because by the time Simon has a grasp of the language, circumstances have changed significantly.Chapter IV: The Call Out of Sulcarkeep: The Sulcars, allies of Estcarp, are a sort of cross between Norton's Free Traders and of Earth Vikings. They predominantly live on their ships, but they have a landborne settlement, containing warehouses, safe harbor etc. Later volumes have maps showing the location of Sulcarkeep, relative to places like Yle and Gorm, and make it plainer why Sulcarkeep was vulnerable.Chapter V: Demon Battle: The 'living dead' armies of the Kolder are apparently modeled after zombies. But they're not (apparently) quite as literal-minded as zombies--apparently because they're centrally controlled.Chapter VI: Fog Doom: Thinking about it, it's a bit odd that Simon Tregarth didn't think of aerial attack right away. The whole of the Witch World is full of unaccountable technology. The Kolder have submarines. So why wouldn't they have aircraft? Come to that, the power source at Sulcarkeep is pretty advanced technology, as well.PART II: VENTURE OF VERLAINEI Ax Marriage: Fulk of Verlaine (in Karsten) became Lord of Verlaine by marriage (?by rape? It's implied, anyway) to the heiress of the previous Lord. Now he has greater ambitions--he plans to marry his daughter Loyse to Duke Yvian, in hopes that the riches Verlaine acquires from storm wrack (and luring ships to their doom with false beacons), combined with family ties in high places, will translate into power. Yvian hopes that marriage with legitimate Karstenian nobility will secure his own position, since he also is a former mercenary. Nobody seems to care about what Loyse wants--except a deflowered (and thus powerless) witch--and another witch, cast ashore among the other escapees from the ruin of Sulcarkeep...II Sea Wrack: You remember the illusory ships the witch created to deceive the Kolder? The people of Verlaine never heard of them--so they're confused when the ships just vanish...III Captive Witch: It's just getting too cumbersome to keep trying to identify the central witch in this book by awkward phrases ('the witch who...'. So (borrowing from later books), I'm going to call her the Lady Jaelithe. After Loyse's ax marriage (which, be advised, remains questionably legal, even if unconsummated), the plan is to rob Jaelithe of her powers by the same method used on the household (former) witch. But Loyse knows the secret passages in Verlaine...IV The Inner Ways: Loyse's escape plan hits a few hitches: and gets the odd assist...PART III VENTURE OF KARSTENI The Hole of Volt: Simon and Koris, along with a few other escapees, land in a small cove, and have trouble finding their way out. The 'hole of Volt' in this case, is a tomb. Koris demands a boon of Volt, and is granted it.II Falcon's Eyrie: The Witches of Estcarp don't approve of the Falconers--for good reason. The Falconers' misogyny is always awkwardly explained, and doesn't really compute. But the gynocratic witches don't necessarily control who the Borderers make common cause with.III A Witch in Kars: It having become clear that the dynastic ambitions in Karsten have become a target of the Kolder (as potentially ruinously as in Gorm), the Lady Jaelithe establishes herself as an undercover sorceress in Kars--with a blank shield named Briant (that pale face seem familiar?) as her leg(wo)man. IV: Love Potion: If the Lady Aldis is not threatened by Yvian's ax marriage with Loyse, why is she in the market for a love potion?V: Three Times Horned: The people of Karsten had apparently never questioned the concept of outlawing people by 'thrice-horning'. In later books, Karstenian people express doubt about the wholesale application of such a process by fiat, without due process. But I've heard no discussions of the process PER SE--only of this particular genocidal application. And there seems to have been little resistance to Yvian's order, except by some people in the outer provinces.VI: False Hawk: The Estcarpians escaping from Kars encounter a robotic hawk, presumably created by the Kolder as accessories for false Falconers.PART IV: THE VENTURE OF GORMChapter I: The Riving of The Border: Most of the newly-outlawed 'Old Race' from Karsten try to escape into Estcarp. So the Borderers concentrate on keeping the border open for refugees--and closed to Karstenian pursuers. This involves recruiting from the refugees, because the Estcarpian forces aren't numerous enough.Chapter II: Tribute to Gorm: Simon Tregarth, trying to trace the Kolder moving into Karsten, runs into an ambush.Chapter III: The Grey Fane: The Kolder don't take prisoners from the 'Old Race', because they're not pliable when subjected to the Kolder mind control techniques. Probably they shouldn't have taken Simon, either...Chapter IV: City of Dead Men: And women, and children... Apparently, the Kolder just killed anybody they had no use for.Chapter V: Game of Power: The Witches' Council, with some aid from outsiders, launch a psychic attack against known targets. But this presumes that injuring or destroying these targets will have any large-scale change.Chapter VI: The Cleansing of Gorm: The forces of Estcarp clear out the Kolder headquarters at Gorm. Then they begin to consider what to do with the Kolder technology.Chapter VII: A Venture of New Beginnings: When there was no plan to continue the series, this was intended to be the summing up. But in the next book in the series (Web of The Witch World) it's revealed that the 'New Beginnings' in the title of this chapter are in FACT new beginnings. Also, there are quite a few unresolved issues in this first volume, which leaves room open for a sequel, at the very least. So it's possible that Norton ALREADY had plans for another volume by the time she ended this one."}, {"userName": "Shannon Courser", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1892847-shannon-courser", "userReview": "The story is interesting, and I like the mixture of sci-fi/fantasy. However, for me, I found the formal language a bit tedious to read through, and found myself having to reread sentences at times to get the meaning. I understand it is a part of how that world is constructed, but for some reason I struggled with it, and it kept pulling me out of the story.As far as the characters go, I liked them well enough, but I wasn't strongly invested in them. Perhaps it was because they always seemed to keep their cool in any scenario; their emotions didn't seem to change very often, which always gave the sense that they could \"handle anything\" that came their way and made the risks feel not as high, even though they were in many situations.Additionally, this story is much more focused on external events and decisions that the characters make as they make their way through a series of events and challenges to understand and defeat an enigmatic enemy. The overall plot was well constructed in this respect, and I found it interesting to follow. However, I personally would have liked to see more character interactions, such as relationship developments, friendship developments (outside of battle strategies and escape plans), and just a general curiosity of learning about each other. You have to figure, if you have a guy from another world show up and start fighting for your team, you're going to be curious to learn about him and his past, right? The same goes vice versa, yet these conversations were never explored. In the end some romance is presented, however, the plot was so focused on external events that by the time these became addressed I didn't really feel that enthused about it like I normally am when emotional confessions happen with well-fleshed out characters.I'm curious to read the next in the series, however I'm not jumping to it just yet, as I have other books on my to-read list that I'd like to try out first. This was my first book by Andre Norton, and now that I got a taste of her writing style I'm not terribly invested in continuing to the next just yet. I'm not turning my back on it entirely, but I don't feel as roped in as I'd like to be."}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2715018-max", "userReview": "This is a portal fantasy novel in the grand tradition of Barsoom and Three Hearts and Three Lions. Like both those other stories, our hero Simon Tregarth is in a life or death situation when he's able to escape our world for another. In this case, Simon winds up in a universe of witches and warriors. He lacks John Carter's superhuman athleticism, but makes up for it with good knowledge of warfare and tactics - plus some understanding of post-medieval technology. The latter especially comes in handy when it's made clear that while the evil nation seems like sorcerers, they're actually making use of advanced technology. The Witches of Estcarp, on the other hand, seem to be true magic users, and Simon himself comes to realize he has some of that same talent. There's also the nameless witch who he rescues (for a witch giving away her name gives people power over her), who reminds me some of the Bene Gesserit or Aes Sedai, and I can't help wondering if Witch World's women inspired both of those creations. There's also a woman who disguises herself as a man to escape a forced marriage and a terrible father, which is always a fun character type. The setting is a bit thinly drawn in this one, but there are some neat ideas like the nomadic sea traders and the all-male warriors that are aided by hawks with mystic powers. The plot moves along at a fast clip, and often jumps over the sort of thing a modern fantasy novel would spend a while on. Still, it's fun to read something quick for a change, and there's clearly more than enough Witch World novels that my desire to learn more about the setting will be satisfied as I read further. The action wasn't quite as well done as in the Barsoom novels, but I enjoyed the mix of wizardry, force of arms, and futuristic technology. It's nice to have a portal fantasy where the protagonist isn't the only one stepping between worlds. I'm definitely going to read more of these, though how many more will depend largely on what I can get my hands on, since a lot of these books seem to sadly be out of print."}, {"userName": "Angelika Belko", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63718198-angelika-belko", "userReview": "I tried so hard not to give up on this book... I failed... I read only (or should I say as much as) half of this book and I was bored to death. I really wanted to read the whole series, but life is too short for reading books that you don't enjoy. In this case it was actually painful. I usually force myself to read till the last page, even when the book is average, however this Witch world made it impossible for me. There was too much telling instead of showing. Characters were really dull, so dull that it was hard to tell them apart. Especially when all the witches can't let you know their names... Seriously??? When there's more than one witch in the scene all you get is bits of dialog coming from God knows who, and your only clue is : ...said the witch with black hair, or the one in silver dress... Really??? And don't get me start on that magic system. The only moment you know they are using magic is when they take out a magic stone, but most of the time you have no idea what is going on whatsoever. And the fight scenes... Well there was one at the beginning that was kind of interesting, later its only worse. It is actually so bad, that you don't care if all of them die or not. There is definitely too little worldbuilding, everything you find out about the world is from infodumping. If I was twelve, maybe, just maybe I would finish this book. But now after reading so many other great fantasy books, I can't bring my brain to that low level, sorry..."}, {"userName": "\u039c\u03b9\u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2", "userReviewDate": "May 14,
