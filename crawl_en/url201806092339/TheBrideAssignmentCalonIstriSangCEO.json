It reminded me of Susan Elizabeth Phillips\u2019 book Match Me If You Can because of the humorous barbs between H/h and the fast pace of the book. There never was a dull moment in the book given the accidental encounters with family members when they were both trying to meet clandestinely. But LM book is shorter and the hero is not obnoxiously cocky like the one in SEP book.But what I missed in this book is the \u201cawwwhhh\u201d moment. LM books distinguish themselves in the romantic gestures the hero does unbeknownst to the heroine which would signify that he had loved her earlier on. In this book it\u2019s supposed to be the Lalique vase which didn\u2019t do it for me. Sure, it was an expensive vase but anyone could buy a vase from a department store. Plus, a Lalique is akin to a Lladro figurine -- they're presents for \"granny\" or a retiring officemate, not exactly a girlfriend or special someone. The company dinner that they had arranged together could have passed off as a climatic moment especially when a guest noted that they were both studiously avoiding looking at each other. But the romance was quickly dispelled after his crass invitation to an affair.
