She would scan the bookcase in my bedroom, which was very special because it belonged to me. It was an old bookcase of polished mahogany, crafted by my Uncle Percy who was a cabinet-maker, and chock-full of all my very own books. There were lots of story books which I had carefully arranged in author order, and some factual ones grouped by subject. I had even invented my own \u201cPolar Bear\u201d library system with little paper tickets for each book, rubber stamped with a polar bear, so that it was official. Friends and family would then be issued (by me) with their own tickets for my \u201cPolar Bear library\u201d, so I could put the book title and the person\u2019s name tickets together, and always know where my books were. But I digress ...It was remarkable how often the answer to my mum\u2019s question would be The Wonderful Birthday, by Freda Mary Elizabeth Hurt. Whenever a new read was not obvious, this one fitted the bill nicely as my go-to comfort read. As an adult I now wondered what was so special about the book, and tentatively reread it.It\u2019s not great literature, that has to be said from the start. In no way is this a classic, and my fifth star is awarded from pure nostalgia. But it gripped me anew, and I happily read half the book in that first sitting. If you were ever a fan of the \u201cFamous Five\u201d series by Enid Blyton, then this book has a similar feel. It has realistic adventures within a cosy setting, fast-moving action and unchallenging language. So what was the difference? I devoured all the books I could read at that age, the more the merrier, so why keep rereading this one?In among the excitement and absorbing storyline, I could now see that there were issues which seemed interesting and important to me even then, and still do. Yes, it could be classed as a children\u2019s boarding school story, but with a difference. It is not geared to either gender for a start. And in the course of the story we explore difficulties to do with class, race, personal and social behaviour, respect, intolerance, and the destruction of the natural world. It may have just been a good story, but it made me think, and root for what I thought was right, and yet I had no idea that this what I was doing. The children in the story were being taught to think for themselves, not to accept anything without using their brains, to share what they had, however great or little, and to develop a strong moral code.The story starts in a dingy little flat in the city, with Janet and Simon Dakers and their mother. They miss their old home in the country, but have had to move near to where their father has a job as a teacher. They all try to make the best of it, but inside Janet and Simon are very gloomy, thinking that they cannot play their fantasy games about \u201cCaptain Bold and Sir Clarence Pendragon\u201d any more. Going to the park is somehow not the same.When Saturday comes they all go on a bike ride into the country and have a lot of fun, having tea at a quaint little teashop when they get tired and thirsty. (Oh childhood memories! Going on family outings into Derbyshire by pushbike or bus!) Their father is behaving very mysteriously, and seems to have decided beforehand exactly where they would go. They come to a huge old house, and you can imagine the children\u2019s confusion when their father pulls out a key, and inserts it in the door ...To cut to the chase, Mr. Dakers has been left a little money, and has a dream to establish his own school, \u201cfor children with no satisfactory home of their own\u201d. It will be hard work, especially since he does not want to charge them very much. He only wants to take seven or eight children, and to just admit ones whom he thinks would benefit.The children are immediately thrilled, and we have quite a few descriptions of the beautiful countryside surrounding what becomes known as \u201cPinetops\u201d school, as the house is set amidst pine trees. They are entranced by it all, and able to play their role-play games, and all their education seems to take on a different slant. Their mother too seems to quickly share Mr. Dakers\u2019 vision of this unique school.Of course when the other pupils start to arrive, life is not then quite so easy. Janet and Simon find that they resent sharing their wonderful paradise with these other children, some of whom seem selfish or inept, or do not know how to behave properly. Not only that, but their rooms, and even their parents\u2019 special attention has to be shared.Susan Tomlin was first to arrive, \u201ca thin, nervous-looking girl of eleven\u201d, then Freddie Watson, a good tempered boy of Simon\u2019s age. Annette Tyson was nearly twelve but \u201cpretended to be much more grown-up than she really was\u201d. The others did not care much for Annette. Greta Holmes was a large girl who laughed a lot, Robin Faithful was a pale worried-looking boy of ten, and Johnny Primrose was just eight, small and a bit babyish.Through the events in the story we get to know each child as an individual. Their mother sometimes explains to Simon or Janet why each child is behaving the way they do, and even the ones who had seemed boastful are found to have good reason for their behaviour. There are other reasons, their mother explains, \u201c\u2018I quite see how you feel. You know, you\u2019re looking at things all wrong ... Susan is starving\u2019 said Mrs. Dakers quietly. \u2018Starving for affection ...\u2019\u201dand as they listen, the children begin to feel a little ashamed of themselves, as they have a home with parents who love them, even if they do not have much money. They learn how others\u2019 experiences are different, and how they must make allowances.Another new boy arrives, and they are all intrigued to know what he will be like, as he is the son of an American singer and has lived in the USA and even toured all round the world. As a Rolls Royce car draws up, and luggage with brightly-coloured labels from different foreign hotels is taken out of the car by the chauffeur, they watch through the window excitedly. They are surprised to see that the boy with the unusual name, \u201cAppleyard Warrenden Smith\u201d is black. Why on earth had their parents not said anything about such an unusual event? Did the Dakers even know? It turns out that they didn\u2019t, but it made no difference. Mr. Dakers thought that it might have been a genuine mistake, since he was ignorant of the musical world, and had not heard of the famous American singer. But he also said what he suspected,\u201c\u2018I think it was for another reason Mr. Trod said nothing of Applegard\u2019s colour. You see, Mr. Trod had been asked by his employer to find a suitable school for his son, and I think that in trying to find one he has met with stupid people who have refused to have the boy, and perhaps have even been unkind to him just because of the colour of his skin. So he wasn\u2019t taking any chances with me.As it happens it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference to my decision to have him here. So long as he behaves himself and is happy with us, he is welcome. I want all of you children to remember that, and to treat him in just the same way you would an ordinary English boy.\u2019\u201dAnd he looked very hard at one of the children who had already made a disparaging remark.Quite a nice lesson about prejudice and tolerance here, for children in a mainly white area, bearing in mind that this novel was published in England in 1953. A little girl who is a neighbour becomes involved with the group at Pinetops. Painfully shy, overprotected and kept away from the outside world because she had been very ill, Anne blossoms in the company of the Pinetops children, and is quickly introduced to a litter of kittens produced by the cat who already seemed resident at Pinetops.As well as the cat, there is a dog, Tip, whom the family brought with them from the flat in the city. He had belonged to the neighbour, a butcher, but it was Janet and Simon who truly loved him as their own, and with whom Tip behaved as if he belonged. When they moved house to Pinetops, the butcher was persuaded to sell this odd-looking, affectionate mongrel, with the floppy ears, to the children, who were overjoyed. Tip takes part in all their adventures, and has a character and energy all his own. Freda Hurt must have had dogs and cats of her own, to be able to write about their quirky ways with such authenticity and good humour.One adventure is when they come across a loutish boy stoning a poor raven. Bravely they stand up to the large boy, and rescue the bird. An eccentric man storms up, demanding to know who has hurt his pet rescued bird, but quickly learns the truth. The children tell their parents all about it, and when a letter comes from this man asking them to tea, it transpires that he is a famous naturalist and explorer, \u201cPeter Penwood\u201d, known to the public as the \u201cBird Man\u201d. The episode where they make their way to his house is very exciting, as he lives in a specially constructed tree house.Another - and hilarious - episode is when a visitor come to see the school. Unfortunately, the letter telling of her arrival has been delayed. Mrs. Dakers is ill in bed, and Mr. Dakers has had to keep an appointment. Just for once, the children have been left in charge of Pinetops. Gamely, they try to cook dinner on an open camp fire outside, and some make an attempt to clean the house. But these are children after all, with a penchant for play and mischief, and no supervision save that they agree between themselves. Squabbles and tempers arise, there are a few little accidents, and even though they try to act as proper hosts and show the visitor around the school, nobody shows their best side. When Mr. Dakers arrives back, of course he is horrified to hear what has happened, and very worried for the future of the school. The children are crestfallen, as they have grown to love Pinetops so. Other episodes include an aggressive neighbour, vociferously resistant to the idea of a school next to his wood, and an acknowledgment of the artistic ability of one of the children, whose paintings are to be exhibited in a London gallery. The children vary in age from about eight to mid-teens, but they all develop and grow in some way through the book. This was the first in the series of books about the small Pinetops School, which I am in the process of uploading onto the Goodreads database. The others I have managed to track down are:The Wonderful Birthday (1953) Fun Next Door (1954)Two to Make Friends (1955) The Exciting Summer (1956) Intruders at Pinetops (1958) Thirteen for Luck (1958)Freda Mary Elizabeth Hurt wrote many other books for children in the 1950s, although unlike Enid Blyton, she is virtually forgotten now. One was about a \u201cpet detective\u201d the cat Mr. Twink. Another, \u201cNorgy in Littleland\u201d (1955) was about the little boy of the title, and his toy scots terrier, who shrink down to model-village size to retrieve a missing piece of jewellery. Another hugely popular series of books was the \u201cAndy\u201d series, including \u201cAndy Takes the Lead\u201d and \u201cAndy Keeps a Secret\u201d. The author, Freda Hurt was born in 1911 in Bromley, Kent, and lived in that English county all her life. As well as numerous children\u2019s books, she also had a successful career later as a mystery writer, with novels such as \u201cThe Body at Busman\u2019s Hollow\u201d (1959), \u201cSweet Death\u201d (1961), \u201cDeath and the Dark Daughter\u201d (1966), and \u201cDark Design\u201d (1972).But it\u2019s The Wonderful Birthday (1953) which has a special place in my heart. It\u2019s a fantasy, pure and simple, but rooted in a true humanity. There is no magic in this fantasy, but there is a glowing warmth and optimism, a faith in the human spirit about this book. What is the special, wonderful birthday? Well, you\u2019ll just have to read it to find that out."}], "description": "", "title": "The Wonderful Birthday\n      \n          (Pinetops #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8436914-the-wonderful-birthday", "average": 4.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1276265576l/8436914.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2834758.Freda_M_Hurt", "name": "Freda M.
