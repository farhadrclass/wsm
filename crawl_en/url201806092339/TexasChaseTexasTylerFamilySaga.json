This was another huge winner for me, huge. It happens to feature one of my most favorite tropes, unrequited love. Am I sick for loving that? Maybe ;) but it's so good, so angsty and so heart wrenching reading about someone desperately in love with another who doesn't quite SEE them. I feel the torture of seeing that someone they love being with another, I feel the empathy that accompanies the hurt and pain that comes from rejection. It all may sound weird, but it's a beautiful pain that always ends with love and redemption. I'm going to go as far as saying that so far, I'm loving SB's old school more than her more recent RS. I recently read Slow Heat in Heaven by her and absolutely fell in love with it. This was along that vein. Marcie loved Chase for so long she became used to receding into the background. Even when she wanted his love she accepted that she may never get it, but all she wanted was the potential for it, a morsel of affection. Knowing that broke my heart but also made me love her more. She was independent and strong but completely at Chase's mercy. I'm so glad Chase finally acknowledged what he was so afraid of. Doing so gave him the courage to love Marcie wholeheartedly and forgive himself. But damn, he said some vicious things to her! I was so pissed off at him for being such an asshole at times. But he did rectify all that so I forgive him.Loved this and loved the whole Tyler family, especially the funny banter between Chase and Lucky. Thank you Mo for this fantastic rec!!!"}, {"userName": "Geri Reads", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11757728-geri-reads", "userReview": "One of Sandra Brown's best book way back when she still writes pure romance. This book has all elements of being a true romance book; unrequited love, family drama, and the hero falling for the heroine in spite of himself. I loved it!!I've read this book way back in college and I remembered being so moved by it. I picked it up again yesterday and re-read it and it brought back the same emotions.Chase Tyler never got over the loss of his wife. After years after her demise, he felt as lost as ever. A chance encounter during a rodeo show brought Marcie Johns and Chase together. They shared a past, a very important one. Marcie happens to the other person inside the car which took Chase's wife, and the one woman who has loved him since kindergarten. It took a failing family business to finally bring Marcie and Chase together in a marriage of convenience. Chase was still painfully in love with his wife and has no plans on replacing her in his heart. Marcie on the other hand was already there. In spite of still being hung up on his dead wife, Chase can't help but fall for Marcie. She was beautiful, successful, sexy and oh so, available. It wasn't long before Chase finally surrendered and just let his feelings for Marcie grow. But just when you thought they'll finally have their HEA, a stunning revelation came between Marcie and Chase. I really can't say anything more without giving away the whole story. But let me assure you that this book will make you feel all kinds of emotions; happiness, sadness, anger, et cetera. A true classic that needs to be revisited now and then. Loved it!!"}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2466134-tina", "userReview": "This book is plain creepy. The heroine is a psycho. Seriously. lol. She's been in love with the hero since they were in kindergarten and pretty much stalked him her whole life. Meanwhile, the hero barely knew she was alive. His wife ends up dieing and she goes behind his back to buy his wife's dream house, lives there, and plans to somehow get the hero to marry her., to finally notice her.

I really enjoyed this one. I mean I have enjoyed just about every one of the Sandra Brown books I have read but this one was a little different. Do I a dare say it had more romance and less suspense? The book starts out with a Prologue that broke my heart. Chase Tyler has lost just about everything that he treasured in his life. He experienced a sense of pain that would change his life. For two years Chase detaches from his family and all that is Tyler Drilling. He is living a life at the bottom of a bottle and at the hands of meaningless romps with women. \nBut sharing in his pain was Marcie Johns. Chase and Marcie share a past. They had been friends through school but were never \u201cthat\u201d kind of friend. She was there the day Chase\u2019s life fell apart. She shared his agony. Marcie needed to see Chase happy again and would do just about anything to have this happen.\nWhen Marcie sees an opportunity to make amends of sorts she doesn\u2019t waste any time. Tyler Drilling is suffering financially and Marcie can help. But as much as her proposition can offer the business relief it means risking her heart to someone who has nothing to offer her.\nWhen Chase and Marcie make the decision to save Tyler Drilling both of their lives change in ways they didn\u2019t expect. As they share a home and a relationship that becomes physical and emotional neither of them are able to process the feelings they are experiencing. There are some pretty sexy moments between these two. Many of them spent out front of the fire. \nThere is also something unsettling going on with Marcie. But as her new life starts to fall apart around her she doesn\u2019t want to give in to the threat. As long as it doesn\u2019t go too far she could handle things herself.\nI definitely enjoyed this one. Marcie was a great heroine. She was strong, beautiful and independent. I loved that her and Chase had a bit of a past. \nAnd I loved that Chase was a sexy, burly, damaged hero. He resisted his happiness at every turn.

As another reviewer said, this book was creepy. The heroine has been in love with the hero since kindengarden (that's around 6 years old?). 30 years later she is still in love with him, even though he never showed any interest other than friendship for her; what's more he fell in love and married someone else. Still Marcie didn't get over him. However two years after his pregnant wife was killed in an accident, she proposes to him marriage in exchange for the money he needs to save his family business. As it turns out, Marcie has bought the house Chase and his first wife planned on buying. Based also on her admission, she has furnished it in the style she thought Chase liked, as she always believed they would end up together living in this great house. All those years, she has learned Chase's favorite drink, food, decorating style, music: EVERYTHING. And she, has believed for 30 years, that she is the right woman for him and that God owes it to her to bring them together; even when he married someone else.

The first book focuses on Lucky, the second book being this one and third book is the story of their younger sister Sage Tyler. All three books provide unforgettable romance with searing passion. I read this book quite sometime back and remembered it to be my favorite. I always tend to love a romance which has a previous history linking the hero and heroine in some manner whether it be romantic or otherwise.Marcie Jones nicknamed Goosey for being nerdy during the years of high school which she shared with Chase and had a major crush on him, is now a successful real estate agent having amassed quite a fortune with her work. She meets Tanya, Chase\u2019s beloved wife, when they seek to buy a house for themselves before their baby comes along. On the way back from viewing the house Marcie was sure would make a lovely home for Tanya and Chase, a senseless accident kills the pregnant Tanya and leaves Marcie with serious but not life threatening injuries. Chase\u2019s world is shattered when in a day\u2019s time he loses his beloved wife and their child who had not even had the chance to breathe into this world.Two years later, Marcie encounters Chase at a rodeo where he nearly gets himself killed on the arena. Marcie stays with him during his brief time at the hospital and finally brings Chase back home since the accident. Whilst Chase has been away immersing himself in alcohol and whoring, their family business Tyler Drilling had gone under and things look really bad for them until Marcie proposes that Chase marry her in order for her to help bail out their business. The idea seems ridiculous to Chase at first but soon he makes up his mind to go along with the marriage even though Chase\u2019s family doesn\u2019t feel too comfortable about the decision.Marcie has her work cut out for her in a marriage where she has to fight with Chase every step of the way to gain his trust, affection and love. Chase determined not to betray the memory of his loving wife doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge the intense feelings that Marcie is able to invoke in him and this ultimate battle of wills proves to be a scorching read. Loved every minute of the sexual tension between the two characters hot enough to scorch the memory chips of my laptop.Loved every bit of the novel. Highly recommended to anyone who loves a good dose of romance packed with a brooding hero who I guarantee you would make your hearts go aflutter."}, {"userName": "Nefise", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8584584-nefise", "userReview": "3.5 stars...It was better than I expected.

I can usually count on them to be well written, with mainly plausible plots, and I usually find them to be quick and enjoyable reads. Sadly, I did not feel that way about Texas Chase. My main reason for disliking the book was the heroine, Marcie. Honestly, I felt like Marcie's actions due to her \"crush\" on Chase were desperate, creepy, and made me incredibly uncomfortable. Instead of feeling like all the things she did for Chase were cute and romantic I found them to be cringe inducing. I wanted to tell Chase to hide and then call the cops. When reading romance novels I like my female characters to be strong and independent, and while Marcie was that way in the business world, her desperation when it came to her personal life ensured that I could not relate to her. Additionally, I hate it when characters seem to have no friends and that was certainly the case with Marcie. I think I could have gotten interested in the plot (nerd from high school finally gets a chance with the Prom King) if Marcie had been written more sympathetically and less like a stalker. My other problem with the book was one specific plot point that I found stupid and was clearly in the book only to cause conflict between the main characters. I am, of course, referring to the phone call from the painting company. Here were my big problems with this:1) Why would a painting company assume that a nursery would still need to be painted 2 years later?2) Why would Tanya give the painter the phone number for a house she didn't even own yet?3) I have bought several houses and my phone number has never been the same as the previous owners. Phone numbers don't come with houses.This scenario was so ridiculous and outlandish to me that it completely took me out of the plot. I understand why it was there, to cause conflict, but I think there were smarter, less lazy ways to accomplish the same thing. I still like Sandra Brown books and will continue to read them but this particular book was really not for me.Note: I was provided with a free copy of this book through the Goodreads' First Reads program but my opinions on the book are entirely my own."}, {"userName": "Keri", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2487587-keri", "userReview": "2 STARS - IT WAS OKAYAUDIOBOOKWhy oh why do I continue to try Sandra Brown romances that were written in the 80's & 90's. They are so sexist! I'm not a bra burning feminist by any means but seriously, the women in Ms. Brown's 80's/90's romances are total doormats. I couldn't believe some of what Chase says to Marcie in this book - really cruel stuff - and she just takes it. He never really apologizes for it and she just keeps giving and giving to him. It's very frustrating. Most of the story was decent, but some of the way Chase treats Marcie was just unacceptable. I need to just stick with Sandra Brown's thrillers that were written in the 2000's.

Yet I remember the basic plots of all three books, which is very unusual for me, so it must have made an impression on me anyway.This month\u2019s read, Texas! Chase, is the second book in the series and to me it seems very very dated, especially in the attitudes of the characters. I always find it interesting to see how far we\u2019ve come and this book definitely shows me. But I\u2019m reading this with my 21st century goggles on and I just can\u2019t relate to some of it, e.g. a woman\u2019s reputation can be ruined if she\u2019s seen entering a house of a man. It\u2019s not a Regency after all.*** MILD SPOILERS ***As for the story itself, I feel it has potential but doesn\u2019t quite deliver. I understand Chase is grieving but he really is an arse for most of the book. And ultimately he accepts quite easily he loves Marcie.Marcie was a little creepy with buying the house for him and her when she hadn\u2019t even seen him in so long and didn\u2019t know when/if she\u2019d see him again. And he had no idea she\u2019d been in love with him since she was 5 (or so). Disturbing.In general I think the plot could have done with a little more substance so that the characters and their interactions would have been fleshed out a little more.I always like Sandra Brown\u2019s writing and this book is no exception (apart from that random ! in the title), but I prefer her crime books to these dated romances with attitudes and views I can\u2019t agree with."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5720350-joyce", "userReview": "I am going to give this one a high four stars.Marcie has been in love with Chase since childhood, but unfortunately for her, Chase is happily married to his wife, Tanya. Chase and Tanya are seeking the perfect house before their baby is born. Marcie, being a real estate agent, shows Tanya a house that Tanya falls in love with. Chase is too busy to go to the house viewing so Marcie drives Tanya over to the house, but on the way there, a car accident occurs, instantly killing off the pregnant Tanya.Two years later Chase has abandoned his business and spends his day drinking, whoring, gambling, all to forget Tanya\u2019s death. Marcie happens to witness Chase nearly getting killed in a rodeo arena, and she, still very much in love with Chase, wants him safe, so she drives him back to his family.Chase arrives at home, and after an argument with Marcie, decides he needs to do something with his life. He starts off by checking how the family business is striving under his brother, Lucky\u2019s management. Chase learns that the business is not doing well and he must try to pay the debt that they owe to the bank. That night, Chase is invited to dinner with Marcie who proposes that he marry her. She explains that the marriage will benefit both of them, Chase will be able to pay off the money his business owes and Marcie will get some companionship in her big house. After much thought (and another argument with Marcie), Chase agrees to the marriage proposal.The beginning of the story was rather dull, but it kicks off after the marriage. I was wary about reading the book because of the many reviews that said Marcie was a lunatic, or obsessed with Chase. After reading the book myself, I can say that Marcie was a strong and independent woman. She isn\u2019t afraid to stand up to Chase and she not only argues with him, but she even slaps him once! I\u2019m glad that Sandra Brown didn\u2019t hover over the fact that Marcie had a crush on Chase. I mean yes, it was mentioned a few times, but Marcie in no way seemed crazy about him. Marcie simply wanted to help Chase, and when she figured that she didn\u2019t want to end up as a lonely spinster, she asked him to marry her.Chase on the other hand, was much more dislikeable than Marcie. ***Spoiler*** When he found out that Marcie bought the house that Tanya wanted, he insisted that they were living in Tanya\u2019s house, that Marcie was second place to Tanya, and that Tanya was the wife that he loved. Then he had the gall to say that sex with Marcie was to dull his memories for Tanya and that their marriage is only on paper. And to top it all off, he never apologizes for any of this. So my conclusion? Marcie is a much more bearable character than Chase. ***End of Spoiler*** I also found it extremely annoying that Chase constantly thinks about his wife throughout the story, even in the last few pages, he thought about his love for Tanya. I can understand that he will always love Tanya but this is supposed to be Marcie and Chase\u2019s love story, it focused way too much on Chase\u2019s feelings and deep love for Tanya. Lucky and his wife Devon have some great scenes in the story that made me wonder if I should read Texas! Lucky after all.The story would\u2019ve been five stars if we could erase those scenes where Chase was being a bastard. There were some heart-tugging scenes that made me shed a few tears and that\u2019s probably why I ended up giving the book a high four stars. This is a book I would recommend if you don\u2019t mind the hero being a little too mean, overall, it\u2019s an above average romance novel."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13454748-robin", "userReview": "With a wife he adores and a baby on the way, life is great for Chase Tyler.

Colleen Marlo does a great job as narrator of the audiobook.Chase is a tortured hero who wallows in his grief. Marcie has loved Chase from afar since childhood, and decides she is the woman who can straighten him up. I enjoyed their various battles where Marcie would verbally kick his butt and get him back on track. I thought the whole marriage of convenience storyline was a bit over the top.

NO.He was deliberately hurtful to her time and again, and even if she apologized and groveled, he didn't blink an eye.

The hero was a childish whine baby and I soon had no sympathy for him.They have a mini reconciliation towards the last 1/2, but the H goes back to being a dbag pretty soon.There's a secondary plot of Marcie having the stalker, but it was pretty much overshadowed by the main story.In the end, I was extremely disappointed and didn't believe the hero at all because the heroine felt like a replacement- because the hero is never actually portrayed getting over Tanya.I LOVE a good second chance/ I've loved you forever trope- but not this one.Unsafe by definition1/5"}, {"userName": "Marielle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31677346-marielle", "userReview": "Review after reread:I've downgraded to 3 stars. I really liked the first half of the story with the damaged hero Chase. He really did hurt and slashed out where he could. I also liked Marcie in the beginning, she was though and didn't put up with Chase's bullshit. And yes, I also told myself to forgive the story for the traditional role patterns between man/woman throughout, this book was written many years ago. But after the marriage of convenience, Marcie's character deteriorated, and the stalker added external conflict I could have done without. In the end I skimmed through the last pages, not interested in the resolution to the stalker-problem. Still, all in all, I enjoyed re-reading this story and might even reread the first half again sometime. ------------Review after first time reading:I really liked how chase was down hurting and therefore mean to everyone else. It wasn't always nice to read but it did feel heartfelt and real. It is a bit dated though, mostly in how he reacts to her; the no-saying and then kissing her anyway. That is also how such things could go, but nowadays writing it down like that would be frowned upon.I'm going to Re-read this in the future to see if it's stil worth the 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Irma", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28808080-irma", "userReview": "No...

You can have a one night stand with that, but to grow old with someone that only lusted after you?! When your body starts to get old and you are not so pretty?! I don't think so. It probably won't last and you'd end up feeling all insecure and ugly.NO WAY IN HELL!!I LOATHE that!!!Second chance romance, to me, only works when there was a previous spark of love before getting the second chance.When the other person has alredy loved another one deeply while you were single, lonely and in love, just waiting in the outsides, MAN, ain't that fucked up!!It wouldn't be fair to you, you deserve more.I like stories when two people find each other after loving others.That is a nice second chance in love and SO not the one we found in this book.I did not like it, at all.The ending was sweet but far fetched, because we all know he much rather have Marcie died than his beloved wife."}, {"userName": "Tess", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2028689-tess", "userReview": "I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads!Just as devouring and delicious as the first book in the series, Texas! Lucky! I found this one to be a little less predictable than the first one in the series, which in turn really grasped my interest. The course of the relationship between Chase and Marcie was unexpected, and I found myself very curious as to how it would eventually blossom into a loving marriage. The mystery part of the novel was also quite unpredictable for me...I swear it wasn't until a few pages before the culprit was revealed that I was able to guess who it was. I love books like that! Once more, just as in the first book, the love scenes are sweet and sensual. Although this is a very easy book to get through, and could probably be read in a couple days, I found myself prolonging it as I didn't want the story to end, only allowing myself to read a chapter or so at a time. Now that I'm through, I can't wait to get my hands on Texas! Sage. I'm very interested to see what her story is about. Bravo, Mrs. Brown!!!

Of course she stated she always wanted the house herself. But still. #2 The part where she offer's him money to help out his family business. And chase said they don't allow outsiders to invest. And Marci said she just wanted to lend them money. So the only solution was that Chase and Marci Merry. I think that could have been done differently. However the rest of the book was great. You really felt how Marci and chase struggled with being married. In different ways. Chase didn't want to let go of his dead wife, which was devastating in Lucky's story. That was shocking. Then when all the drama starts to go down, and emotions are getting to high, Marci starts to get strange phone calls and it is affecting her greatly. But the worse part about it was chase didn't believe her as well as his brother, because they were sill realing from the fact that Marci bought the house chases dead wife wanted. Lots of drama ensues, chase comes to the realization that he does love Marci almost to late. I do think Marci deserved more of an apology.

Brown had my heart in my throat throughout. Her character and scene development places you not only in this story, but in the centre of this family. Each event draws you further and further in. I appreciated how the prologue set the scene, giving you a glimpse into what had happened without dwelling on it. Brown\u2019s eloquent descriptions meld with her fantastic storytelling to create a romance that will really make you believe.This is definitely a character driven tale. Every event is directly correlated to someone, and their reactions are what drive the story forward. His refusal to move forward combined with her refusal to give up leads them on a journey that kept me on my toes. The narrator really made this novel for me. As much as I enjoyed the story itself, it was really one of those \u2018can\u2019t put it down\u2019 novels, the narrator\u2019s intonation and snark made it unforgettable. As a whole this was a very enjoyable read. It can easily be read as a standalone or as part of the series.

I stopped reading her when she started writing suspense/thrillers. Texas! Chase is my favorite book in this trilogy. I loved loved LOVED it. Chase and Marcie's (\"Goosie\") romance is the kind that tugged at my heartstrings. When he lost his wife and unborn child in the first book, Lucky, my heart broke for him. Now in Chase's book readers get to see just how badly he deals with it. And I love a story about unrequited love. What I loved about Marcie, is that she's not afraid to say and go after what she wants--although there were a couple of times I winced when some of her offers were rejected. There is a mystery element to the book--the stalker. I usually don't like too much suspense mixed in my romance novels, but this one I didn't mind. It didn't overwhelm or overshadow the romance building between Chase and Marcie. The only thing that saddens me--at least 15 years after I read this book--is that the digital version is STILL not available. Which I plan to purchase the second it becomes available."}], "description": "Chase Tyler has been the object of Marcie Johns\u2019s desire since grade school.
