After all, what two-week vacationer could fail to dream of a year in Provence, Marrakesh or Tuscany? These are modern Mediterranean fairy tales, and they\u2019re put together with the simplest ingredients: magical neighbors, hellish builders and much more olive oil than you expected. The Caliph\u2019s House looks like one of those books, but it isn\u2019t. British travel writer Tahir Shah\u2019s highly readable account of moving his young family to Casablanca is constructed with something weirder and sharper: vinegar, perhaps, and ectoplasm.It opens ordinarily enough. Shah is at a Casablanca lawyer\u2019s office, signing the sale contract, taking in the view of the street, ruminating on why he had always wanted to skip the grey skies of England for the warmth and color of Morocco. He picks up the heavy old key. The caliph\u2019s house is his. At that very moment, a car bomb explodes outside the lawyer\u2019s office, covering them both with broken glass. An eerie portent of things to come, perhaps. Shah\u2019s new home, the vast Caliph\u2019s House, has been empty for 10 years and now stands decrepit, if not derelict, on the fringe of a shantytown. With it, Shah finds that he has also acquired staff: three lugubrious and potentially sinister \u201cguardians,\u201d who come \u201cas if by some medieval right of sale.\u201d More medieval still, a vengeful she-jinn called Qandisha haunts the house, they say.Over the next few months she reveals her presence in various grisly ways: stringing cats up in trees and sucking raw meat through the toilet bowl. Children are said to be her favorite target. It may be no coincidence that the local gangster wants them out so he can steal the land. Down in the shantytown an elderly stamp-collector, who will take no money for teaching the author Arabic but likes his foreign stamps, gives him some amiable advice: \u201cYou put mannequins in the children\u2019s beds, and tell your children to sleep in the oven each night. Do that, and you will all be safe.\u201d An educated young lady Shah hires to get the renovations underway ultimately claims to have a 300-meter-tall jinn sitting at her shoulder, cleans out Shah\u2019s bank account and reports him as a terrorist to the police. Her replacement \u2013 the crafty, efficient Kamal \u2013 is a binge-drinker on a perpetual high-wire, a sort of psychopathic Jeeves whose brutal and bizarre history includes a long interlude in the United States, where he made the acquaintance of Mohamed Atta, the 9/11 hijacker.Yet nothing in Casablanca is quite as odd as Shah\u2019s determination to carry on as usual. He and his imperturbable wife want servants, a big house in the sun and a bellyful of local color for their two toddlers. What they get is the local custom of dropping gobbets of raw chicken into the well to appease the jinns, and a bellyful of streptococcus. It\u2019s almost fatal, but they don\u2019t flush the key down the one working lavatory and get a cab to the airport. The thought briefly flits through Shah\u2019s mind, but it doesn\u2019t take hold. Instead, we are led on a darkly comic journey into the North African underworld, with the reckless but thoroughly well-connected Kamal as chaperone to Shah\u2019s dubious Dante.The joke is that Shah, in spite of his Afghan heritage, in spite of his descent from the Prophet, is a man with a rationalist moral gyroscope. He doesn\u2019t believe in jinns, which everyone else seems to have like head lice. He\u2019s bothered by rats, he has servant trouble, he discovers the desperate shifts the poor make to survive \u2014 the stealing, the sudden flashes of dignity, the mutual aid networks that underpin the black market, the medieval superstitions. Nothing works quite the way it works in a mature, liberal, democratic capitalist society. Everything has a price, but the routes to that price are devious and surprising. Every explanation raises more questions than it answers: Shah has baffling encounters and warily follows instructions he cannot understand.One night he is taken to a mysterious rendezvous in the desert and expects to be killed, but nothing happens. Another day he gives a lift to an old man who steals his car. Fifteen minutes later, the elderly thief drives back, apologizing that if he took the car for good, no one would ever give an old man a lift again. It\u2019s in this sly side-step from common reality that the Shah persona comes into its own. He doesn\u2019t play it too knowingly, but he doesn\u2019t play himself for a fool, either.If Kamal is a Jeeves on amphetamines, Shah is no woolly-headed Wooster. He finds himself a very good fixer. He gets the house superbly done, with tiling and the tadelakt, so that he and his family can leave the single room they\u2019ve occupied all year. And he finds out a lot about his grandfather, a widower who retired to Morocco because it was the one place he\u2019d never traveled with his adored wife; he lived for years in Tangiers before being struck dead by a Coca-Cola delivery truck. Shah writes an outrageously black comedy with the straightest of poker faces. And in some quiet alchemical way, he finds himself at peace with the guardians and the imam and the gangster down the road and the shanty dwellers on his doorstep and the bank manager at home. He\u2019s living there still."}, {"userName": "Jessaka", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4659464-jessaka", "userReview": "The title sounded good and maybe that is how I ended up with this book in my bookcase. Good thing it did, because it was a very fun read, and so I couldn't put it down.Tahir Shah had been to Morocco when he was a kid and never forgot the place. I had been to Morocco at the Epcot Center in Florida's Disneyworld and never forgot my meal there. Mix dried fruits in meats or any food, and yum. I have a meatloaf recipe with groundup dried apricots in the center that I used to make for myself when I was single. My husband would never try anything with dried fruit.Tahir grew tired of living in sunless England, so he talked his wife into moving to Casablanca. How she lasted I will never know. While I would find it wonderful to live in such a place, I could not have put up with the remodeling of their house.When they buy a 22 room house, they learn that three guardians (workers) come with it, but with these guardians come problems. First, Tahir is told that jinns live in the house, and they must get rid of them. (Jinns are evil spirits that are mentioned in the Quran.) Next, he is told that it order to get rid of the jinns he must kill a goat in each of the rooms. Are you counting? Tahir doesn't believe in evil spirits and will not even think of killing 22 goats, so he ignores the guardians who are now constantly after him about these jinns and the trouble they can and will cause. Since he won't kill the goats, the jinns tell him that his family must be quiet when they talk, and that they must never use the bathroom in the middle of the night, because jinns are drawn to water, especially that in their commode. First time he gets up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, while in midstream, a guardian grabs him. Stop!!!Tahir's remodeling doesn't go very well at all, because the people he hired, well, they created messes, and it looked as if nothing was ever going to get done. I believe that I would have fired them all or in my case, I would have my husband do the work, and I would be the clean-up crew. If I were doing it alone I would have just patched up holes and painted the place. Yet, when I look at the photo of Tahir's home that is posted here, the finished product is really beautiful and was worth it all. Tahir's writing continued to charm me to the very end, but if this is a true story, then I feel for him and for his wife. Still, he learned from the experience and they are still living in Casablanca."}, {"userName": "Sydney ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45380743-sydney", "userReview": "This was an interesting story, because I picked this up, thinking that it was some type of historical fiction... but, it was about a modern man's quest to re-establish himself in his homeland. I quite enjoyed the story, only because you could feel his journey - from learning what a 'jinn' is to understanding a women's role in Moroccan society - he just had a lot of things to learn.It's an easy read, no swearing or inappropriate scenes - a lot of it is just about day - to - day life. It's not for those looking for a political story or even a religious one.

I loved the sayings which headed every chapter, such as: \"Never give advice in a crowd\" and \"Every beetle is a gazelle in the eye of its mother.\" Shah was very lucky to be able to connect with his grandfather's life as well, because his grandfather had spent his last years in Morocco. Meeting those people who had known him and been touched by him is irreplaceable. I'll admit that sometimes the things that happened in the book were so fantastic that I wondered if they could possibly be true, but I've found nothing to suggest that they weren't. It's worth the price of the book to find out how Shah and his 'think outside the box' assistant gets his money back from the architect he fired. An absolutely inspired solution.

It was amusing, I'll give it that. I think I would have gotten more out of it if I hadn't been living in Morocco for so long. During a lot of the book, I was thinking that the author was stupid or that he had done things that were really stupid/ naiive. Then the language thing - I guess he speaks fluent French and in Casablanca that works fine because everyone there speaks French but things were so easy for him because he always seemed to have either a translator with him or people who spoke his language. And he's a man, so Casablanca, while often stressful and strange, wasn't the same for him. Maybe part of it is just that I hate Casa so much I wonder why anyone would ever choose to live there. Again, maybe I'd have liked it better if I had had my own transportation, more money, better places to stay, didn't understand the Darija people said behind your back, didn't realize much everyone was inflating prices and could speak French....so many 'ifs', right?It's hard for me to get a feel on his take on the culture. He didn't understand a lot of things that were happening around him, and he tried to describe things with humor. Sometimes this worked, and his ironic voice was okay. But other times it just annoyed me and made me frustrated with him. I felt bad for his wife, who was basically a non-character in the story and only had occasional paragraphs about her, and would have been interested in learning more about her experiences and takes on situations. But then that would have been a totally different story."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/774847-megan", "userReview": "I have to confess that my opinion of this book may be swayed by my minor obsession with the following topics: Morocco; picking up and moving your life to a new and exotic locale; and refurbishing old houses with traditional techniques. Since this book is about the author's experience moving his entire family from England to Morocco, buying a villa and working with local artisans to return it to its former glory, it was right up my alley! The author has a wonderful, strong sense of self in his tone, and the humor with which the story is conveyed feels a bit like listening to a good friend's trials and tribulations over a cup of coffee. Anyone who has had occasion to try to get something done within the restrictions of a foreign culture will relate to this story, and enjoy laughing along with Shah at every new complication and frustration he encounters."}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5889446-marie", "userReview": "I have read a couple of these books were people do mjor life changes and it always amazes me how little preparation they take and how incredibly naive they are. He starts the books telling us that all his friends and family were against the move and I now agree with them. Not because of the idea of such a drastic move (from London to Casablanca) but because the guy is a bit of an idiot. For a start he makes no start on learning either French or Arabic, he signs a contract in arabic without getting anyone to translate it for him and be pays the builder up front, in full!!!! As I said the guy is a bit of an idiot.Yes there are laughs but in my case more sighs. I understand that he probably deliberately leaves out a lot about his wife and children to keep some privacy but instead I got the feeling that he kind of abandonded them while he revelled in the experience. I was also wondering where in all his dramas he managed to get his actual bill paying work done.Thank god it was well written and easy reading too or I might have thrown it out the window but if you like this genre then go for it."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1184328-jessica", "userReview": "Tahir Shah came across as ethnocentric and self-involved. He barreled through his adventure (read: early mid-life crisis) thinking only of himself and his money; often times mentioning an author's paltry salary, then making an ostentatious building decision for his mansion. I was also perturbed by the way in which his wife was merely a sounding board for his frustrations. Read this book if you're looking for a way to flip mansion's in Morocco while swindling the local people and dismissing their culture as lazy. Or, save yourself the time and don't read it at all.

Everything is made by hand!Teamwork!Zellij, beautiful Moroccan mosaic tilework.When I came across the title of this book, I thought it would be about the author's travel experience living in Casablanca for a year. But no... This book is about the author buying(!) a house in Morocco, moving his family to Casablanca and their first year living in Dar Khalifa (the name of the house).When I started reading this book, I was a bit apprehensive that this book would be about a foreigner, who would impose his Western beliefs and standards upon a land utterly different from the West. Or worse, that he would have exotic fantasies and expectations of Morocco and would then be left in disappointment. But no... Fortunately, this book is just an honest account of Tahir Shah's experience settling down in Casablanca. He doesn't mask the challenges he faces in everyday life, but he also gives the reader a full account of what draws him to Morocco (his grandfather, who died in Tangier and the ability to give his children a better upbringing). While most of the book does include details on the renovation works of Dar Khalifa, the author also gives incredible insights into Moroccan culture and mentality. I loved Kamal! He is such a rascal, who always comes up with an innovative solution, no matter how difficult the problem appears. Moreover, I couldn't help thinking how incredible Shah's wife Rachana is, to have endured all that has happened in the book! Nonetheless, this book is truly funny and I laughed hard, especially when I read the story of the \"Bavarian hausfrau Lulu\"~! I also enjoyed the little proverbs preceding each chapter (\"The value of dwelling is in the dweller,\" \"Never give advice in a crowd\")Overall, a very light and enjoyable read. A must for anybody who loves Morocco.The same life that poses the problem tends to provide a solution.Real charity is given anonymously.

He wants to escape England and the rat race. He wants to recapture the magic of his own childhood vacations in Morocco. He wants to learn more about the grandfather that had died there years ago. He wants a house to renovate, one that will allow his delusions of grandeur to run wild. Shah gets all of that and more when he buys a crumbling palace, Dar Khalifa (The Caliph\u2019s House) in Casablanca. He also gets three guardians (they come with the house). He gets an architect with a zeal for destruction and little interest in renovation. He gets an assistant, Kamal, that he doesn\u2019t trust and doesn\u2019t particularly like, but needs desperately. But mostly, he gets Jinns. Lots of them. And it turns out that jinns, invisible and usually malign spirits, can cause a lot of problems. Whether you believe in them or not is irrelevant.The resulting (nonfiction!) book, The Caliph\u2019s House, is a delight, a thoroughly entertaining description of Shah\u2019s first year in Morocco. The characters he meets are almost unbelievably eccentric, like those in a zany comedy movie but all the more interesting because they\u2019re real. His adventures are often laugh-out-loud hilarious. His first night in his new home, Shah has his very first run-in with jinns\u2026in the toilet. Kamal manages to obtain a refund from the useless architect by throwing a feast. Shah\u2019s world map is condemned by the censorship police because Western Sahara isn\u2019t in the same color as Morocco. I laughed so much that my husband forbade me to read in bed when he was trying to sleep.Best of all, the whole time I was laughing, I was learning. This book was, for me, a fascinating glimpse into a culture very different from our own. Moroccans have rich superstitions and traditions that infuse every aspect of their lives. Shah skillfully illuminates facets of Arab culture that, in this era of post-9/11 paranoia, we seldom see or bother to consider. He doesn\u2019t ignore the fanatics; they\u2019re there, lurking in the fringes of his narrative, but they don\u2019t seem to have much of an influence on daily Casablanca life. I, for one, didn\u2019t miss them.In spite of frustrations and challenges, Shah comes to love Morocco and its people, warts and all. He lives there to this day. Having read this book, a part of me (a very, very small part of me) longs to join him.This book does have some objectionable words, but in the context in which they appeared, they were usually pretty darn funny."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1776993-donna", "userReview": "As someone with a personal connection with Morocco, who has lived there, who has gone through various trials and tribulations there, but who is still very much in love with the country, this book is definitely a 5 star read.Not only does Tahir Shah capture the funny side of the tough times faced in Morocco, but his feelings for the country, very much like my own, only grow on the completion of these difficult moments.This truly is a wonderful read. It definitely captures similar feelings to what I had in the beginning of my relationship with Morocco, and brought me a lot of nostalgia when reading it."}, {"userName": "Tamara Agha-Jaffar", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51003559-tamara-agha-jaffar", "userReview": "Tired of what he describes as his \u201cmeager existence\u201d under the wet, grey skies of England, Tahir Shah decides to uproot his wife and young children and move to Morocco, chronicling their experience in The Caliph's House: A Year in Casablanca. Shah purchases the Caliph\u2019s house (Dar Khalifa) in Casablanca, a dilapidated home, empty for ten years and situated on the edge of a shantytown. Upon entering his new home, he discovers his house comes equipped with a staff of three guardians and a she-jinn known as Qandisha. The intrepid guardians do their best to educate Shah on Moroccan ways and caution him to tread carefully so as not to incur the wrath of Qandisha who haunts the house and who (understandably) resents his presence. So begins a year of living in the Caliph\u2019s house. Shah\u2019s vision is to remodel the decrepit home and restore it to its former glory. This brings him in contact with Moroccan craftsmen who are incredibly skilled at what they do but who work at a maddeningly slow pace. Shah eventually learns to accept the Moroccan way of doing things and, by the end of the year, the Caliph\u2019s house has been beautifully remodeled with fountains, colorful mosaics, plush gardens, and a library that is the envy of any book lover. Additionally, the jinn have been successfully exorcised from his home through a combination of prayers, chanting, rituals, and the slaughter of a goat. The book concludes with Shah and his wife lying back and admiring all they have accomplished in the space of a year. He is finally at peace.Some of the fantastic happenings in the book should be taken with a grain of salt. But perhaps nothing is quite as unbelievable as Shah\u2019s gallant determination to forge ahead in the face of what appear to be insurmountable challenges. Shah speaks of these challenges with humor and irony. What shines throughout is his love for his adopted country in spite of the trials and tribulations he endures\u2014or, perhaps, because of them. Shah graphically illuminates Moroccan culture and life in Dar Khalifa. His engaging jaunt through the underbelly of Moroccan life exposes us to shady characters who speak in ambiguities, a place where corruption is rampant, where poverty abounds, and where money exchanges hands without quite knowing what one is getting in return. It is an excursion made all the more appealing due to Shah\u2019s ability to capture the sights, sounds, scents, and texture of life in Morocco that waft through every page with vibrancy and color. A delightful and entertaining read.

It won't be my last. He has several others.I love the idea of what author Tahir Shah did: He somehow convinced his wife to leave everything in their home in London and go with him, taking their two small children, to move into a sprawling, long-neglected grand house in Casablanca. Shah speaks no Arabic and (he says) poor French, but he manages to get along with the help of a number of diverse Moroccans whom he employs. I love both experiences of and stories about culture shock, and there's plenty of that here. Shah makes plenty of mistakes but finds his way little by little, becoming more Moroccan in the process, it seems. This is a good thing, because his typical Western attitudes toward work and efficiency clash with the way things get done in Casablanca.Although the timeline here follows the year-long renovation of a traditional large house (with several inner courtyards, fountains, stables, wooden stairways, and descriptions of traditional mosaic tile techniques and special wall plaster made with egg whites), the real story here is about the culture of Morocco, and how a mostly Western man (his grandfather came from Afghanistan) encounters it and learns to adapt.My one complaint is that Shah has a pattern of stacking short, unrelated scenes together, and sometimes a scene ends in a very unsatisfying way, like a little cliffhanger. For example, he's having a conversation with someone. The other person drops a tantalizing hint about a heretofore unknown complication. The conversation isn't over yet, but the vignette ends and we move on to some other scene. This wouldn't be so annoying if we were switching to a different character, as in a novel, but our narrator is always present in every scene. This is a minor gripe, but sometimes it really bugged me.The writing is spare and plain, with more intimation of feeling than descriptions of what can be seen."}, {"userName": "Norelle", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13331756-norelle", "userReview": "3,5\u0160\u012b bija...pieredze :DEs nekad neesmu grib\u0113jusi p\u0101rcelties uz Austrumu zem\u0113m un ar\u012b p\u0113c \u0161\u012bs gr\u0101matas - joproj\u0101m negribu :DN\u0113, nu autoram ir kr\u0101saina pieredze un no malas jau liekas smiekl\u012bgi, bet nu...re\u0101li padom\u0101jot, diez vai es sp\u0113tu b\u016bt ar t\u0101du paciet\u012bbu k\u0101 autors.

Loud with harsh and so unique arabic speech, crazy squeal of wheels here and there, people yelling at each other, imam calling for a prayer in the middle of the night, children playing outside.. The book is beautiful. Beautiful with dark-skinned men, women wrapped in veils, snow-white carved arabic palaces, blue mosques, dusty roads, colourful markets, dirty slums and amazing gardens. The insane mixture of everything is a totally new culture, so wild and insane for a person born and raised in Europe.In Morocco everyone follow the Koran, believe in genies, everyone are full of superstitions, everything can be bought on a black market and a third uncle's cousin is considered a close relative. In Morocco people have their own timetable for working, they never apologize for their faults, in Morocco you never pay in advance, you bargain to death and never to ask the price before purchasing, in Morocco a world map image can be censored, in Morocco a sheep is a deficite item to get on a certain day of the year, in Morocco everything has its own rules which can be stupid, ridiculous, funny, insane, vicious or just shocking, but that's Life there. The writer who got sick and tired of rainy London decided to move there all at once with his family and he's experiencing the culture slowly. All his impressions, feelings, anger, surprise, hesitation, everything is here, within 450 pages, not a single lie (at least he's claiming so :)). Brilliant.P.S. The only thing i didn't really get is how a writer with obvious financial difficulties could buy a palace in Casablanca, afford costly renovation works, expensive antique furniture, all house servants keeping, his daughter's education, nevermind food, a car and a bunch of money he has lost in unawareness in the beginning of his moroccan adventure :)"}, {"userName": "Floramanda", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12719-floramanda", "userReview": "Tahir Shah writes a fascinating, non-fiction account of the year when he takes his family from the hustle and bustle of London to Moracco where they buy a dilapidated old mansion to renovate. It is an amusing look at the clash of cultures as Shah navigates through Moraccan society, a fusion of Islamic, European and African cultures, to restore the Caliph's House to its original grandeur. Along the way, he learns how to do things the Casablancan way, from buying building materials on the black market, getting his London library past the Islamic censors and dealing with is household staff who regard the home's Jinns (genies) as more powerful than their new human boss. In the end, Shah must try to exorcise the Jinn's from the house and make it his ownThough autobiographical, Shah's writing style is pleasant and humorous, reading like an engaging novel. I missed his family, though, as his wife and two very young children stay in the background as builds his dream house. Rachana is a very patient and adventurous wife, I would have packed my family back to London in the first chapter! added 09/08Reread this book for book club and I'm adding another star.

They move into an old villa that is in disrepair. The book is the story of their first year, trying to adapt to Moroccan culture and to renovate the old villa. It is written in the style that is supposed to be humorous but that I can generally not stand - ha ha ha, I am totally unprepared and isn't that funny. I would have stopped reading but Shah also writes just enough about his insights into Moroccan culture and just enough about the own changes in his life to make the book okay. He begins to show some humility and respect for the culture he has chosen to live in: \"We were both blinkered by our upbringings. I was restricted by the West's scientific ideals, and Hamza by the traditions of his culture.\" Shah's family was originally from Afghanistan and although he was raised in Britain, he spent time in the Moroccan mountains; his grandfather lived in Tangier at the end of his life. Some of the best sections of the book are when Shah is trying to reconnect with his grandfather. There is a subtle change in Shah as he begins to accept and love living in Morocco. I wish it were a stronger part of the book. I would also like to read his wife's account of the same year.Each chapter has a short quote or saying - I assume traditional Moroccan.

The foundations of a country are very important to me when reading a \"travelogue\" sort of book.The format of the book was bizarre to me. It read a lot more like fiction and it really threw me off. There was a lot more dialogue than I had expected and I did not enjoy the writer's sense of humour. Beyond that, I didn't really feel like I had anything in common with the writer, or any of the other people within the book for that matter, and I had a very difficult time connecting. Had reading this book not been to satisfy a challenge requirement, I doubt I would have made it all the way to the end, however, it was a fairly quick read (about 3.5 hours) so I don't feel like a huge amount of my time was wasted.One redeeming quality is that the descriptive language does paint a very beautiful picture with words. I enjoyed that much more than the excessive dialogue. Bottom line though, again because of the extremely narrow scope, the writer fails to capture anything really unique about Morocco; what sets it apart from any other country."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58873392-linda", "userReview": "Teiksim t\u0101, nekas tik izcils, lai klan\u012btos, bet \u0101rk\u0101rt\u012bgi saisto\u0161i uzrakst\u012bts ce\u013cojuma rom\u0101ns par isl\u0101ma kult\u016bru Marok\u0101, kur jau izsenis tic d\u017einiem un vi\u0146u p\u0101rdabiskajai ietekmei uz cilv\u0113ka dz\u012bvi un labkl\u0101j\u012bbu, k\u0101 ar\u012b spilgti raksturoti marok\u0101\u0146i k\u0101 tauta, kurai nav nek\u0101 svar\u012bg\u0101ka par savu poz\u012bciju nostiprin\u0101\u0161anu p\u0101r saimnieku/pas\u016bt\u012bt\u0101ju/priek\u0161nieku, darot visu piln\u012bgi pret\u0113ji pl\u0101notajam un pras\u012btajam.

First, some of the stories just seemed hard to believe. Perhaps the author's style just feels fictional, but I frequently felt like he was embellishing to make the story more interesting. He also lets people walk all over him, which may make for a wilder story, but it also makes him a less sympathetic character. Second, the author seems to have almost no regard for how much he's putting upon his wife to take on this adventure. I kept thinking hearing her story would have made a much more engaging read."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2352900-elaine", "userReview": "A delightful and funny account of living - and renovating - in Morocco. I have never read any of the My Year Under The Sun with Quaint but Wise and Eccentric Locals genre, but suspect the book follows the conventions of those books rather closely.

By turns hilarious and harrowing, here is the story of his family\u2019s move from the gray skies of London to the sun-drenched city of Casablanca, where Islamic tradition and African folklore converge\u2013and nothing is as easy as it seems\u2026.Inspired by the Moroccan vacations of his childhood, Tahir Shah dreamed of making a home in that astonishing country. At age thirty-six he got his chance. Investing what money he and his wife, Rachana, had, Tahir packed up his growing family and bought Dar Khalifa, a crumbling ruin of a mansion by the sea in Casablanca that once belonged to the city\u2019s caliph, or spiritual leader.With its lush grounds, cool, secluded courtyards, and relaxed pace, life at Dar Khalifa seems sure to fulfill Tahir\u2019s fantasy\u2013until he discovers that in many ways he is farther from home than he imagined. For in Morocco an empty house is thought to attract jinns, invisible spirits unique to the Islamic world. The ardent belief in their presence greatly hampers sleep and renovation plans, but that is just the beginning. From elaborate exorcism rituals involving sacrificial goats to dealing with gangster neighbors intent on stealing their property, the Shahs must cope with a new culture and all that comes with it. Endlessly enthralling, The Caliph\u2019s House charts a year in the life of one family who takes a tremendous gamble. As we follow Tahir on his travels throughout the kingdom, from Tangier to Marrakech to the Sahara, we discover a world of fierce contrasts that any true adventurer would be thrilled to call home.", "title": "The Caliph's House: A Year in Casablanca", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/936696.The_Caliph_s_House", "average": 3.96, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320535796l/936696.jpg", "reviews": 587, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7102.Tahir_Shah", "name": "Tahir Shah"}], "type": ["Travel", "Nonfiction", "Northern Africa", "Autobiography", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/936696.The_Caliph_s_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131011.The_Caliph_s_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29913507-kalifa-nams-gads-kasablank", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/612156.The_Caliph_s_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16151388", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17732293-kalifo-r-mai", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1332455.In_Arabian_Nights", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181255.Sorcerer_s_Apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108914.In_Search_of_King_Solomon_s_Mines", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181257.Trail_of_Feathers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13633596-timbuctoo"]}
