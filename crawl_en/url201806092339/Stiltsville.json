I can still tear up thinking about the loveliness of the last few lines. This book follows a woman from the moment of meeting her future husband, through their marriage, their years of childrearing and beyond, and the writing is so compelling and vivid I felt I lived those years with her. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Ali Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4662429-ali-murphy", "userReview": "This book was not what I expected at all. I was expecting light and fluffy. Instead, I found language that was clunky and ordinary and off putting. The first few pages I was disconcerted by the plainness of the story and the style of writing. But I quickly found that I wanted to read more. I wanted to know how Frances's story went. How did it all end? For me, it ended with a quiet contentedness about love and marriage, including my own.I have often heard the phrase \"marriage is hard\" and it is a sentiment that I have never agreed with. If it's that hard you are married to the wrong person. This book captured, for me, the simplicity of a good marriage and the phases that it goes through over (hopefully) a long time. Sometimes you are just more into each other as a couple, or not as the case may be, and this ebbs and flows.This is a love story, plain and simple. It is not grand or sweeping, it's everyday stuff. The ordinariness and clunkiness that I found so off putting in the early pages ultimately became the anchor for the book. This could be my life. It could be your life. In the end I cared very much about Frances and Dennis and their family and I shed a little tear when it was over. This book reminded me of the everyday beauty that surrounds us and the importance of all those people in my life who I love."}, {"userName": "Bob Mustin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2496216-bob-mustin", "userReview": "I\u2019d become jaded about modern American fiction, and the younger crop of fiction writers. What did they have to write about? I kept asking myself. Over the past couple of decades and until the past couple of years, we of the so-called middle class all lead pretty cush lives, leading to nothing much other than pettiness and banality. So, really, what was I to have expected of thirty- or forty-somethings who had sharpened their bland writer\u2019s chops in MFA programs? But hoping beyond hope, I keep reading them.That\u2019s why Stiltsville was such a pleasant surprise. Fiction has been backed into a corner in the U.S. \u2013 genre makes the money, and non-fiction bleeds away would-be fiction writers. So enterprising writers have had to adapt. Daniel chose to write her fine book in first person, giving it a memoir feel, and that has added intimacy to what could have been yet another fictive effort about nothing. But here I should synopsize the story.Frances, the narrator and central character, has found her way from Atlanta to Miami and tenuous friendship with a woman named Merse. Merse has been seeing a young man, Dennis, and despite herself, Frances falls for Dennis, and they become a couple. The story then becomes a chronicle of Frances\u2019 continuing friendship with Merse, with Dennis\u2019 sister, Bette, who early on discovers her romantic attraction to women, and of the marriage. Soon, a daughter, Margo, is born, Dennis settles somewhat uncomfortably into his slot in the legal profession. The couple have their ups and downs, but they\u2019re minor. The couple ages, Margo grows up, goes to college, and marries. And Frances and Dennis then begin to cope with the trials of age.Sounds pretty bland, doesn\u2019t it? But as with Updike\u2019s bland middle class characters, the gift to readers is in the telling. Daniel\u2019s prose, as she introduces character after character, swings between backstory and each passing moment of past-tense present time, is near-flawless. MFA has been good to her, and she\u2019s returned the favor to her readers. But wherein is the luster, other than her storytelling ability? Miami, Dade County, and the surrounding and encroaching waters, the weather \u2013 all these are as much characters as her people. Coastal life, as Hemingway and others have proven countless times, is more than a backdrop; human life in coastal areas has to adapt to the water, the heat, the hurricanes, the flooding, and Daniel, knowing this, takes full advantage of it. The book is probably as much a real memoir as it is fiction, despite the author\u2019s fully fleshed characters. Stiltsville is real; a clump of vacation houses built on stilts a mile or so offshore in Biscayne Bay. Daniel is gentle with the metaphor, but she clearly means the stilt community to parallel her characters in their ephemerality, their isolation, as well as their need to be tenuously connected. Stiltsville isn\u2019t without flaw, but it\u2019s nearly so. It\u2019s a fine effort by a gifted young writer, and this book deserves every bit of praise it gets."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1530028-erin", "userReview": "Daniel herself, at her first Madison reading, almost apologetically said that her book doesn't contain any cliffhangers. This is true. It is a quiet book, but a quiet book can be incredibly powerful, and STILTSVILLE is. Susanna Daniel's anatomy of one couple's marriage was like quicksand -- it drew me in slowly at first, and then the characters she rendered so fully and artfully came to consume my thoughts. I stayed up late last night reading the last 70 pages. I had only intended to read a few, but every time I turned out the light, I ended up turning it back on again (3 times in all), until I finished...and sobbed. This one will hit you right in the heart."}, {"userName": "Sara Strand", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10582065-sara-strand", "userReview": "Susanna writes makes you question whether this is actually a real love story or not. Because it's not a love story like you see in movies. It's like a for real love story, where two people fall in love and get married young, and they question whether it was the right decision or not, someone thinks about infidelity, and it's the every day problems of an ordinary couple raising a daughter. You find yourself nodding your head along because everything is so true to what it's really like to be married and be raising a family, and the stress of the unexpected. And through it all- they have Stiltsville. The sanctuary that held the family together, the rock that reminded them what life was about, and the place that seems to hold it all together. I won't tell you what ultimately happens to Stiltsville or the family as a whole, but I will tell you I could not put this book down. The very last line of the book reads: \"I held my husband in my arms and pressed my face to his face. I kissed his lips. I told him I loved him. I told him, Thank you, over and over. I told him, Thank you for my life.\"And while this normally wouldn't be significant to anyone, it is to me. Because while I don't have the perfect marriage and we absolutely struggle each and every single day- I know that no matter what, I will always be grateful to Matt for the life he's given me. Without him I wouldn't have the things I have, I wouldn't be the mom to two awesome kids, I wouldn't be where I am today without Matt next to me. And so I challenge you to think about that the next time you feel like you're at rock bottom in your marriage or are having a hard time not stabbing your spouse- what are all of the positive things in your life that are because of them in some small way. I think it's so easy for us to give up, cheat on someone, get divorced, or just mentally check out because staying married is a lot of work. It requires patience, forvgiveness, the ability to break down what you're angry about and see what part specifically is making you angry and why, and most of all, humility. It's not always going to be easy or perfect- and you have to know going in that there are going to be a lot of days where you will question your decision. And that's OK. I highly encourage everybody to read this. I loved this book so much and I can't stop gushing about it. I got my hair cut and talked for four ladies about it. Everyone at work has heard me rave about this book. I even walked past a lady looking at books and I completely started telling her how amazing this book was. Because it is.

It sounded like my kind of a book and I wanted to read it as soon as possible. It was a bit of a slow read at first. I liked the story and was getting interested in the characters but I started to wonder why I wanted to read it\u2026why did I bump all of my other books down to the bottom of my queue and choose this one? But soon I was caught up in the events in the lives of this Florida family. Frances, Dennis, Marse, Bette, Gloria, Grady, Margo, Scott and many other characters. The only way that I can describe this novel is sort of like the peeling of an artichoke. You read about one event and that leads you to the next event and the next and the next and the next after that. I think for me it was reading about ordinary people dealing with all of the day to day and year to year events in their lives. The struggles and the triumphs and the mistakes and the joys are all wrapped up in these houses and the neighborhoods in and around Miami beginning in the 1950\u2019s and ending at the end point of a 26 year marriage. Stilthouses, of course, play an important role in this story. It is where Dennis and Frances met\u2026it is where their story begins. There are actually still stilthouses in Biscayne Bay near Miami, Florida. They look odd and unsafe and beautiful. The stilthouse in Dennis\u2019s family seems to be a point of refuge and happiness for them during the various upheavals in their lives. They provide an escape and a getaway during trying times. I loved this book. It touched my heart and soul. I cried as the story ended. Suzanna Daniel writes lyrically and beautifully and masterfully. It was one of my favorite reading experiences so far this year. This story and this family will stay in my thoughts for a long time."}, {"userName": "mark", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565363-mark", "userReview": "This IS women's Fiction - and also so obviously the product of creative writing workshops - all the i's dotted and the t's crossed. But, it lacks grit. There really is nothing here but a fairly boring, average life of an an American woman ... who gets married (once) has a child (one) who grows up. It begins in 1970 and runs through 2004. It takes place in Miami and covers that city's growth and historical events (but not the famous 2000 election.). The tone fluctuates between low grade depression and maudlin. There is no joy, no laughter, no anger. The house on stilts (Stiltsville) is a good metaphor. Life (the ocean) sort of rolls along separate from (below) the characters(emotionless) and then a hurricane comes and knocks it down (death). The writing is good, and the back and forth - the foreshadowing and backtracking didn't bother me. There just isn't much drama here, but I found it informative ... Oh, so that's what it's like to be average. I quit reading on page 244 and skimmed to the end.

Anna Quindlen. Kate Maloy. Elizabeth Berg. Jeanne Ray. These talented authors have all written beautiful novels that take the ordinary and make it extraordinary. Their books explore the everyday life of mothers, wives and friends, depicting scenes of domestic life with believable situations and authentic voices. These \"comfort\" reads are the sort that don't involve wars or murders. There are no car chases, no mysteries to solve, no supernatural disturbances. They may not be the sort of read my husband would enjoy, but I love them! I love the sense of familiarity to my own life. I love the sense of affirmation I feel after reading a passage about the dynamics between mothers and daughters. And I love to read about long-standing marriages, full of the predictable ebb and flow of love and happiness. Daniel has written a tender story that is sure to satisfy those who share my enthusiasm for women's fiction, as well as those who enjoy reading anything set near the ocean, as I do.As for my new hometown, I'd fallen quickly and surely in love with it. I loved to drive through the dense neighborhoods with my car windows down and smell the rotting sweetness of a ripening mango tree. I loved to eavesdrop on the loud conversations of the ladies at the deli counter, ferreting out select phrases using the lazy Spanish I'd acquired over the years. I loved the lychees and star fruit that fell into my yard over the neighbor's fence, and I loved the bright bougainvillea that dropped its papery pink petals onto my lawn. I loved the rusty barges loaded with stolen bicycles that plodded down the Miami River and out to sea. I loved the half-dozen chilly February nights, all the windows in the house open and the fireplace going. I loved the limestone and the coral rock, the fountains and the ocean and the winding blue canals. I loved the giant banyans and the dense wet mangroves and the gumbo-limbo trees and the many-sized, many-shaped palms. I loved the pelicans and manatees and stone crabs and storms and even the thick, damp summers.Final thoughts: When the frigid, dark days of winter become unbearable, I'll pull this book from the shelf to read a second time, warming my chilled bones vicariously through Daniel's beautiful prose, dreaming of the day when, like Frances, I can walk around the house in nothing but a pair of shorts, tank top and sandals. Now I understand why so many retirees settle in Florida!"}, {"userName": "Keija", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/140824-keija", "userReview": "From page one, Daniel draws the reader into the exotic and glittery Miami milieu that makes up her debut novel's setting. In Frances, we have a narrator we can admire and sympathize with and cheer on--her voice is compelling in its even-toned compassion for the people around her. In a mere 300 pages, Daniel creates a rich and many-layered world around Frances and Dennis DuVal. Frances, a Georgia native, meets Dennis in Stiltsville, falls in love, and moves to Miami. In an instant, the trajectory of her life is forever altered, and as the novel unfolds, Daniel gives us a Miami that is flawed but gorgeous, a place well worth forsaking any other life you might have made for yourself. Like Miami, the DuVals' marriage is complex and wonderful--it seems that they are both built for marriage's constant companionship, even while many of their friends prove less traditional, or less able to withstand marriage's natural elasticity. Daniel introduces such a strong cast of supporting characters--Dennis' rebel sister, Bette; strong and unsentimental family friend Marse; vulnerable and doted-on daughter Margo--that by the end of the book, I felt as if I'd lost an entire family I'd never even had. In that way, I wish STILTSVILLE were a serial TV show rather than a movie, so it could go on and on and on. These characters, by book's end, were my friends, and I cared deeply for them. Mid-way through the book, during the child-rearing years, I found myself getting mildly impatient--I found myself less invested in parenting's attendant mundanities, such as parent-teacher conferences (yes, Daniel's style is so ultra-realist that life's smaller moments find a stage in this book), but because Daniel's language is luminous, her prose understated but utterly resonant, I was able to ride it out with pleasure and only a twinge of impatience. I hope it doesn't take her another ten years to write her next book--I'm eager for more from this fantastic writer."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/399004-amanda", "userReview": "This is not the type of book that I am normally drawn to. I like my books a bit more strange, to have a bit more intrigue. Sometimes I say I don't like to read books that are \"just\" about people. This, however, was a treat to read, as it was written by a woman Jon and I know in Madison (mainly through poker and ultimate frisbee games with her husband).I really enjoyed reading it and in fact read it very quickly. I thought the sections were paced absolutely perfectly -- setting up or hinting at some sort of conflict early on and then back-tracking to describe its development. It was just enough of a draw to make each section very interesting and very compelling. I also really liked the characters and enjoyed reading about their lives. Additionally, the book overall was very touching and certain turns of phrases that were used I thought were just spectacular. One that stuck out in my mind even after the book was finished, after the main character's first kiss with her future husband: \"I cherished the sense of caged joy.\" It's a feeling I remember well.Because of my association with the author, I also read quite a few book reviews prior to reading, something I also tend not to do, so I went into it with quite a few pre-conceptions. Such pre-conceptions usually do more harm than good (even if it means simply that I become unable to trust my own judgment of a book), but in this case they did not do any damage.

The relationships of each one and their daughter Margo are so normal and ring so true that there is no questioning their reality. This family during the 20+ years of the marriage, lived and loved near Miami, amongst family and friends, on land and on the water at their vacation cabin at Stiltsville. When I started reading I wasn't expecting to like this book so much, but the author just keeps the story moving ahead and keeps you turning the pages to learn what happens next.

Look no further than the debut novel Stiltsville by Susanna Daniel. Opening in 1969, in the small community of houses called Stitlsville, built on pilings in the middle of Biscayne Bay, the reader is immediately captivated by the main character, Frances, as she meets the man that will become her husband. The young couple\u2019s house in Stiltsville serves as an object lesson about the precarious nature of life, marriage, and the passage of time.

It's not deep reading, but a good solid beach read.Frances' life is rather, well, unfixed. She seems to drift in and out of things - her job, her relationship with Dennis, her moving to Miami, her marriage, etc.. There's no sense that she's really passionate about anything that happens to her or her family. Even her husband Dennis' ALS and eventual death seem to be met with the same blase nature with which she meets everything that's come before.

A young woman on vacation meets a Floridian, falls in love and marries into a Coral Gables family and circle of friends. Years pass, storms blow through, a daughter grows up.

It is at the end of a chapter or after time passed in the sections of this book that the \u2018plot,\u2019 per se, revealed its subtle, tidal pull. I was reminded of Wallace Stegner, but with a contemporary and distinctively female voice. Not a lot happens in this beautifully written book, except entire lives.

When I first cracked open Stiltsville and read the opening chapter, I formed an opinion of the book and was a little hesitant to move forward. The actions by the key character touched close to home for me and I didn't know if this was a book I'd be able to get into, let alone give a fair shot. But then I kept reading, because I needed to know more. I needed to know why people were still talking about this book. Plus, there was something about Frances and her friend Marse that hooked me.So while I expected a book that would deal with a broken friendship, what I got was a look at everlasting friendship, a look at marriage that survives despite disappointing jobs, loss of children, debilitating disease, infidelity and more. In short, in Stiltsville I got a dose of really hard reality told in the most gentle way possible. Sometimes, books that deal with these heavier issues can seem a little \"fairy-tale like\". Things magically go right, the right events happen, the story is manipulated by the author to give the reader a sense of closure. Susanna Daniel managed to give me that sense of closure without any of the fairy-tale nonsense. Not only that, but she dabbled in things that had me dreading turning the page, but she didn't go there - because she didn't need to. Just the touch, the very idea that a wrong choice might be made was enough to shock me into realizing just how precarious life can be and how fragile relationships are if not treated correctly.While this isn't a light summer read, the setting of Miami, the descriptions of the water, the house on stilts - all these add up to a read that will make you think, but still give you that summertime feeling.

The book is written through the eyes of cool collected Frances taking us with her as she recounts various events in her life, starting with meeting her husband Dennis.The book simply follows her life and those around her. Meetings, friendship, marriage, motherhood. Other characters stay throughout the book, sister\u2013in\u2013law, friends, in-laws. That makes it sound rather dull, but dull it is not. Susanna uses her talent too, putting it simply, and writes a cracking good book.It is based in Miami and informs the reader of the changes that happened over decades as the city moves from the relative quiet of the 60\u2019s to a changed and much different city of the 90\u2019s. Her description of hurricanes and the effect that it had on everyday life is worth reading.The title Stiltsville refers to a holiday house built on stilts, offering a haven for weekend getaways with boats, fishing, sunbathing and general partying.

I had very high hopes for this novel, looking forward to another author\u2019s debut. Unfortunately, I feel like I read the whole thing wondering where was the meat of the story?Stiltsville follows Frances\u2019 life as she meets Dennis, falls in love, gets married, and then lives life. And that is basically it in a nutshell. I found myself wondering where the mystery was, the big complex situation/problem, the action, the passion, the laughter, the intensity. None of that was found here as the novel slowly moves through mundane details of Frances\u2019 life with Dennis and their daughter in increments of time. Skipping one, two, or six years between chapters, it feels like a very broad overview of what\u2019s going on (with one side storyline that sort of died out and never went anywhere), all while providing nebulous details (a word used more than once in the story itself.) I never connected with Frances\u2019 character and didn\u2019t feel like she had much of a personality. The other characters and the situations in this novel left this reader longing for more and hoping it was on the next page.I really hate not to have many glowing things to say about this novel as it\u2019s Susanna Daniel\u2019s debut. Stiltsville has been and continues to receive praise, but I just don\u2019t see what the hype is about. I found this novel to be slow and uninteresting. I was hoping for something more.My lack of words says it all. This book was just\u2026eh.2.5/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93254-michelle", "userReview": "Story starting in the late 60s and spanning a marriage. At 300 pages, that's a lot of living to pack in. The book started slow for me. The style of writing reads less like a story and more like the recounting of something that happened. (It sounds like your mom telling you a story). Also the structure is weird. There are a lot of unnecessary flashbacks. For example, the daughter comes home crying from a slumber party. Then the author backs up and talks about the weeks leading to the slumber party that caused the crying. This happens frequently and it is somewhat peculiar. Then, suddenly, we jump forward another five years. This didn\u2019t always flow well for me.Also, the title is somewhat misleading. Yes, the main character and her husband own a house on stilts in the Biscayne Bay but it really is relatively minor part of the book. I expected more scenes set out there, more interaction with the other stilt-house owners. There was also a whole drug-running thing that never seemed to go anywhere. Despite these quibbles, I did enjoy the book and was interested in the relationship between Frances and Dennis as well as the other characters in the book. Frances\u2019s relationship with her sister in law was particularly endearing. Life is painted realistically (though she could\u2019ve scratched harder to uncover more darkness). Nonetheless, I did enjoy this book and came to care about the characters (there were tears at the end!)"}, {"userName": "Janine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2546677-janine", "userReview": "This book is interesting. It seems like a superficial summer-read, but its really not. The writing is excellent. Wonderful descriptions of Miami ... One can tell the author loves the place. Stiltsville actually exists. There is a certain nostalgia in this book which gave me the constant feeling that I am reading a very sad and melancholic story. Some events live up to that, but in general, I think it might be a reflection of how the author feels about Miami, and how it has changed. There are several references to that in the book. I can never get a sense of happiness, satisfaction, and love, even though the main character, Frances, proclaims her endless love to her husband Dennis several times. It simply does not come across for me. Character studies are done fairly well. The reader meets a small circle of folks and partakes in their lives. My ever-present need for details was satisfied. But nothing really happens. I kept waiting for some type of turn and twist, but waited in vain. Some activity takes place - an \"almost\" affair, a \u201cclose call\u201d murder, and sickness. But other than that, this novel is laid back. Not boring, no, because even though little happens, I found an appreciation for it. At the end I thought that this was the object of the author \u2013 show life with friends and family in a city she knows, along with its changes and some key events that can happen during one\u2019s life time. Nothing more, nothing less."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1336988-wendy", "userReview": "It's hard for me to say whether I loved this book because of its many parallels to my life or because of the story itself or a combination of the two.Like the main character's daughter Margo, I spent many weekends and summer days at the Red House in Stiltsville as a kid in the 1970s and a bit into the 1980s and some of my favorite memories were made there. The author spent time at the same house and her description of the house in the book made it feel like I was walking through my memory. Everything from the wood paneling and kitschy interior to the double bunk beds and wide porches was just how it was. The eel was real too.I grew up in Miami during the Mariel boat lift and the race riots in the late 70s and early 80s and watched Miami go from a place where you could sleep with your windows open and doors unlocked to a place on edge.Like Margo, I was also at the University of Florida during the student murders in 1990 and came home from school to help my family in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992.Aside from my personal connection to the story, I thought it was a beautifully written study of the life of a marriage and a family. And yes, although very few books have made me cry, I did shed a few tears at the end. I also hugged my sleeping husband a little closer."}, {"userName": "marymurtz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3763424-marymurtz", "userReview": "I loved the oblique and understated way this book unfolded, the development of the characters and the plot building slowly but solidly as the narrator goes over the changes in her life since the first time she visited the stilt house near Miami. She goes with a friend she has just met at a wedding and falls for the man her friend is crushing on - eventually they marry and Frances (the narrator) describes friendships, family crises, her marriage and the way their lives, their city, their world - changes over more than thirty years.It's not a strictly year by year chronology, but rather a series of milestones and high points, descriptions of specific events and timeframes that marked watersheds in her life or the life of her family. Her daughter's birth, special events, tragedies, betrayals, and countless quiet moments that have the resonance of truth to them you don't often find in a good novel. What happens in the book and what the book is about are two different things. This is a beautifully written, moving, and ultimately satisfying book about a woman's life, the life of her family, and how we weather the tides and storms and currents that try to erode us.
