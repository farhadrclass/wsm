The only thing missing to make it truly British is tea, biscuits and a cold pint! Actually, this series reminds me of the hilarious horror/comedy Shaun of the Dead! It's day three of the zombie apocalypse and the action is heating up, life is looking pretty bleak and Hawie and his new friend Dave face even more danger out on the road but this time, it's the human survivors who are more dangerous than the Zombies. Howie and Dave get trapped in a new town, they face zombie hordes, feral kids and murderous gangs who used to run this town resulting in more chaos and bloodshed. Luckily, Howie has Dave to watch his back and teach him a thing or two about survival and combat. 'I'm a supermarket manager, not a solider. What do I know about combat or fighting techniques? Dave on the other hand, is not all he seems. Once upon a time, Howie was a shy, slightly awkward unassuming guy who went about his quite life and boring job but that was three days ago... it was another life time, a different world. In this new world, it doesn't matter who you were before, only what you're made of and what you're willing to do to survive another day. 'A few days ago this act would have sickened me, if someone explained this situation to me in the canteen I would deny that it was right and say no person should ever be treated like that-that we have law and order and everyone is entitled to respect and dignity. Not now.Howie maybe losing his aversion to violence and blood thirst but he still has a strong sense of morality, a keen sense of right and wrong and helping the weak, the vulnerable and that makes him a likeable and worthy hero.The Undead Day Three explores Howies struggle with moral dilema, his new circumstances and the changes to his personality without slowing down the narrative and I really appreciated that.I can't wait to see what happens next and who they'll meet on the road."}, {"userName": "Mehsi", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6720768-mehsi", "userReview": "Well, this was terrible. Day 1 and Day 2 were pretty great. I had some issues with the choppy/weird writing (and still have issues, some sentences just didn\u2019t make sense in any way), and maybe some other smaller things, but let me just tell you that Day 3 was terrible. Not only did it bring a full-time Dave (urgh, terrible character) with it, but also carnage (really, was that needed), bowel movements (I don\u2019t need to know how much came out of his ass, nor do I need to know the smell, thank you), and then there were even more scenes that just made me cringe or roll my eyes.Oh, and I laughed so hard when those kids came out near the end, and the reaction of our MC was: \u201cWhere are their parents? Why are they out in this, they should be behind that barricade. Someone has built it and I can only guess there is a safe place behind it.\u201d Really guy? Do you think these kids even have parents? When all of the world is dead? They are probably survivors and banded together. And no space is safe in the world of the undead.And what happened at that barricade, or more the journey to find that vehicle, was weird and at times the story jumped and hopped. One moment x would happen, then a, then x, then back to y. Sometimes we would just get some magic event happen and then back to normal business. It was all confusing, and I had to read back a few times to make sure I don\u2019t have any missing pages in my copy.Dave was a terrible character. He never speaks, he was boring, he was annoying, and I wish we had a character who was a bit more of a match to our MC than Dave. It was just all awkward and strained.His continuous Mr. Howie also got annoying. Really, can\u2019t you just call him Howie? I know he used to be your boss, but come on, this is the end of the world, you can let go of such niceties.Plus what happened at that barricade? What the actual fuck? Suddenly he went from silent and aggravating to some kind of serial killer on the loose after years of solitude in prison. It was highly unnerving.But even if I thought this, I didn\u2019t like how the MC kept berating Dave in his head. Yes, Dave is weird, awkward, eh, boring, and more, but he did teach you some things.The massacre at the beginning? Um, whut? I know you hate those zombies, don\u2019t we all, but seriously, was that truly needed? You could have been killed yourself, and then what would your sister or your parents do (if they are still alive).Plus, it just felt so endless. Like the day would never end. yawnsSorry, pretty good start with Day 1 and Day 2, but what the hell happened with Day 3? It was just over the top, weird, awkward, disturbing, and unnerving. I am not going to continue reading this series.Review first posted at https://twirlingbookprincess.com/"}, {"userName": "Freedom", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15980316-freedom", "userReview": "Day three was such a dichotomy. One minute I was agog at the happenings on the page, the next giggling at the haplessness of Howie or the ways of Dave. Speaking of Dave, he has to be my favorite character so far and I cannot wait to see more of him as the days progress. 5* again for Mr. Haywood. I cannot believe how close to the bone or how great these episodic books are becoming. Roll on day 4, let's do this!"}, {"userName": "Patty P", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24840011-patty-p", "userReview": "Day one & two were sooo good then day three.
