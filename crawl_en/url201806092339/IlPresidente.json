Yes, that was better.It is hard to say why Simenon is not taken more seriously. His novels timelessly examine the human condition, and his spare, elegant style can easily be compared withWith who? Hemingway? No, too obvious. Inaccurate as well. That Swedish author perhaps, what was he called?He can't remember. It's on the tip of his tongue, but the name won't materialize. Anyway, this is no good either. He erases it all and starts again.\"Do you need anything dear? Now remember, you mustn't overtire yourself.\" That would be the nurse.

In his library is the self-condemning, handwritten confession of the premier\u2019s former attach\u00e9, Chalamont, hidden between the pages of a sumptuously produced work of privately printed pornography\u2014a confession that the premier himself had dictated and forced Chalamont to sign. Now the long-thwarted Chalamont has been summoned to form a new coalition in the wake of the government\u2019s collapse. The premier alone possesses the secret of Chalamont\u2019s guilt, of his true character\u2014and has publicly vowed: \u201cHe\u2019ll never be Premier as long as I\u2019m alive... Nor when I\u2019m dead, either.\u201d Inspired by French Premier Georges Clemenceau, The President is a masterpiece of psychological suspense and a probing account of the decline of power.My Review: I got a CARE package from one of my old pals from Texas, filled to the brim with Simenon works...but not the Maigret stories, to my relief (read 'em all) and delight (I've never read any of the non-Maigret books)! The President is a delicate and careful autopsy of a once-powerful man's reluctant and relieved laying down his armaments. His life always consisted of public service, unmarried and childless and grasping for the levers of power to make his isolation into welcome solitude.Simenon's Maigret novels are, as murder mysteries must be, formulaic. Simenon's gift came from creating a rich and satisfying story from these commonly available materials. It's a bit like watching Meryl Streep in a movie: She IS the role, she can't be more than glancingly perceived as the actress who starred in any other movie. Chameleons have that talent...so do cuttlefish...yet to find the gift of remodeling one's self in our smelly, sweaty human selves amazes and delights us every time.This 152-page tale is a welcome surprise in this era of bloated, dull series books that could and should have been short stories. In my view, the less an author says, the more s/he has to focus and deliver a high-quality experience. Simenon wrote what was necessary to illuminate the long career of the eponymous president and place it in an historical setting. The impact of the actions taken by the president become, by design but still of necessity, quiet bombshells...silent even in their death throes.This is a book to savor, to sip and ponder the complex flavors mixed in exacting proportions. A simple story, made well, translated carefully, and presented without hype. It is a treat in a literary landscape as pillowy-soft and cloyingly sweet as today's is simply to be told that great hearts still beat faster in pursuit of desired items and outcomes. And they remain great hearts, giving their all and making no excuses."}, {"userName": "KOMET", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183137-komet", "userReview": "Simenon has crafted a thoughtful, interesting short novel about a former French Premier, who, in his prime, had been a master political operator and adroit manipulator of people. Now, in his early 80s, retired from politics, quasi infirm, and living on a small estate in Normandy with a small staff attentive to his needs and whims, he reflects upon his life and career. He comes to realize that for all his secretive, circumspect ways, he is being spied upon. But by whom? What's more: his former protege is now poised to assume a position of supreme influence in forming a new government in Paris. The old man, remembering his former protege's treachery, possesses a damnable piece of evidence that could destroy his political career. Will he float this disclosure or not? This is a gripping story showing the vagaries of the mind and heart of people consumed with the acquisition and use of political power. It is also a subtle, psychological study of the first degree loosely based on the life of Georges Clemenceau, former Premier of France (1917-1920)."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83139-jennifer", "userReview": "Every once in a while, I fall in love with a particular publisher. The first time I remember it happening was with Soft Skull Press. Then, the New York Review Books. There have been other, more fleeting crushes, of course, but when I'm fully in love with a publisher, I haunt their website, constructing long wishlists of titles. I consider how many books I'd have to buy at once to get the wholesale discount. In bookstores, I look for a certain spine dimension, color scheme, logo. Right now, I am in love with Melville House Publishing -- specifically, the Neversink collection. So when I was at the library, but NOT to check out books, as I already had one overdue and was in the middle of three more, and I turned around to see the familiar graphics of a Neversink cover design on the New Titles shelf, I knew I was doomed.Of course I took it home with me.I did not give myself permission to start reading it until I finished at least one of the books I was reading. Still, it was like a ticking time bomb sitting on my shelf. I have let too many library books go overdue lately. I finished 400 Years of the Telescope, and immediately replaced it (in its place in my purse) with The President. Still, chances to read it kept slipping by for one reason or another until a Friday, I finally got to dip into it during a short lunch at Zoup!I read the rest of the book on Saturday.I don't even know when was the last time that I got to sit down and read a whole book in one day, but it's something I've been missing. Especially over the holidays, as that was exactly the sort of thing I would do when I was young and had no kids. It was hard, at times, due to my lack of practice, to fully devote myself to the book. Through no fault of The President, which I loved, I would read a few pages and my mind would wander. One page -- \"Wait, should I go check the laundry?\" Three pages -- \"I wonder if there are any new pins on Pinterest?\" Two pages -- \"Oh! Now I need to make a new cup of tea!\" And so on.I did get better at shutting out these wandering thoughts as the day wore on and this book moved closer to its conclusion. I was supremely satisfied when I reached the end, yet I find I am struggling to articulate the reasons why. Every attempt at summary seems a gross over-simplification to my mind. Though I do feel compelled to list some of the themes it touches on -- retirement, death, power, ambition, reckoning...Suffice it to say, it is a tragedy that this book was out of print for 40 years, and I cheer Neversink for bringing it back. This book is wonderful. I plan to read it again, perhaps many times, later in life."}, {"userName": "Jayaprakash Satyamurthy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1497559-jayaprakash-satyamurthy", "userReview": "A retired statesman, once one of the handful of most influential people in his country and the world, is set off on a trail of reminiscence and introspection when he hears of a former protege being approached to head the government.

The President is a study in stasis, an aging politician living alone at the edge of the sea attended only by his servants, austere, isolated, contemptuous, and still somewhat enchanted by his own myth \u2013 which of course crumbles as the book very deliberately unfolds. As usual I enjoy Simenon's style most, the atmosphere he creates around his characters and the way he imagines the dry thoughts of a Great Man who knows he's at the end of his life.

A larger than-life figure he was at once feared, respected, admired, and often hated. It seemed that whenever the French Republic had a crisis, be it monetary, labor, social strife, or war the President of France would call on him to save the republic one more time. Now, at age 82 he is sick and living in relative seclusion in a house off the Normandy coast. He is watched over by a personal secretary, a cook, physician and chauffer. His days are spent in isolation and he spends much of his waking hours quietly contemplating his life. His stillness is that of the aging lion. He sits in his study and barely moves, as if conserving what little energy and time he has left. As the story opens France is facing yet another crisis. The government has fallen and the President is seeking desperately to find a Premier to step in to save France one more time. As the country's eyes turn to the most likely prospect, Chalmont, the retired Premier asks himself whether he should go public with the damaging information that he has about the man who was once his most trusted assistant.Loosely based on the latter years of Georges Clemenceau (\"Le Tigre\") George Simenon's \"The President\" is one more reason why I will pick up and read a book by Simenon anywhere I can find it. Perhaps best known for his Inspector Maigret stories such as The Hotel Majestic (Penguin Mysteries), I think his finest work can be found in what he called his \"romans durs\" or hard stories such as The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics). These were not police procedurals but, rather, stories that looked at the dark side of our nature. The Simenons I have read have all been fine examples of the art of writing and \"The President\" is no exception. Simenon takes the reader into the mind of this aging leader as he contemplates the world around him, from the political crisis to the randy behavior of his young kitchen girl, you get lost in his own thoughts and musings. The premiere's decision as to whether to pull the rug from under Chalmont's pending ascension to power is handled with skill.If you already know and admire Simenon this book should be added to you collection. If you have not read Simenon yet this is as good a place to start as any. Highly recommended. L.

The edition I read was combined with another novella, The Train (about which more separately). The titular Premier is, at 82, long retired from the French government, living a rather curmudgeonly life on the coast of Normandy, and provided for by a staff (driver/valet, secretary, cook, nurse, security men and even physicians) apparently still on the government payroll. It is a constricted life, by age and physical ability, but also by the sense that his staff keep their bosses informed of his doings, for whatever political benefits or liabilities might accrue to the coalition in power. And indeed the Premier is still very interested by the goings-on in Paris.In fact, he has retained some documents which could prove embarrassing to various people, most significantly his one-time proteg\u00e9 who is now on the cusp of being asked to form a government as the nation \"is in crisis\". The President of the Republic has called our no-longer younger minister to make the request, and is promised an answer the following morning. It was on the news, the aged Premier heard; the question is: will the younger man come and visit the Premier asking for advice (or forgiveness)? A terrible storm rages in Normandy, which has cut off power and telephone; To stay in touch, the driver has rigged up the car radio with speakers inside the kitchen (this written in 1957). Will he come?Morning dawns, and there has been no visit. Power is restored to the house, but the Premier soon learns that his own power over the affairs of the nation are truly a thing of the past. With this realization comes a certain peace. With the help of his secretary, he spends the morning disposing of the supposedly incriminating documents he has kept, learning that the government has known about them all along."}, {"userName": "Adam  McPhee", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28230750-adam-mcphee", "userReview": "[Names were of no importance to him, so he had not altered the one the property went by when he bought it.The local people had told him that the word \u201c\u00e9bergues\u201d referred to portions of the codfish prepared for use as bait, and as F\u00e9camp was a codfishers\u2019 port and fishing was the mainstay of the whole coast, he had been satisfied with that explanation.

The Premier has some damning information in his possession that could sabotage the younger man's plans altogether. He has a long internal debate as to whether he should publicize this material or keep it private. In an extraordinary, extended sequence toward the end of the book, the Premier mentally floats between this world and the next, and realizes that the acquisition and use of political power are rather trivial matters in the overall schemes of the cosmos.

Eppure, da quando si era ritirato sulla costa normanna, dopo la caduta del suo ultimo governo e la sincope che lo aveva colpito, il presidente sapeva di essere strettamente sorvegliato. Non solo da quelli che lui chiamava i suoi cani da guardia \u2013 gli ispettori che si davano il cambio davanti a casa sua dietro preciso incarico del ministero degli Interni \u2013, ma anche dall\u2019infermiera che lo curava, dalla segretaria, e dal fedele autista. Gli stessi (e pure di questo era quasi certo) che frugavano con accanimento fra i suoi libri e le sue carte \u2013 soprattutto dal giorno in cui aveva detto a un giornalista di aver cominciato a scrivere le sue memorie \u00abnon ufficiali\u00bb. Qualcuno, evidentemente, lo considerava ancora pericoloso. Ma chi?
