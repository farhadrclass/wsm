This is the third and final volume of his trilogy, so I won\u2019t say much except that it is a worthy conclusion that still leaves possible room for further adventures in this universe. Spanning over a thousand years, the novel takes us back to the origins of the viral outbreak and the man who will become Patient Zero, the first vampire, then zooms forward centuries to the human settlements that have formed after the apparent disappearance of the viral threat. But, of course, the vampires are not gone . . . simply waiting. When the final battle arrives, humanity faces permanent extinction unless our band of heroes can unite and defeat the first vampire in his lair . . . a crumbling, viral-infested Manhattan. This is sounds interesting to you, definitely start at the first book: The Passage.

I was a complete blubbering mess while reading the last section; it was like this overload of emotions. Bittersweet doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.I would have never guessed how huge of an impact this trilogy would have on me when I started reading The Passage. I\u2019m extremely glad I re-read the first two books before jumping into The City of Mirrors, though. It had been so many years, and I don\u2019t know if this ending would have impacted me as much as it did if I hadn\u2019t re-read them.Cronin does a phenomenal job weaving past and present in this transgenerational tale. It all comes together in this book, and the way everything is connected is mind blowing! It\u2019s like watching history in the making and getting to see the outcome. It truly is an epic journey from beginning to end.The City of Mirrors is utterly breathtaking, and the characters and their fight for humanity are the heart of this compelling story. Amy, Peter, Alicia, Michael, and all the others are such amazing characters. They\u2019re all so wonderfully fleshed out and complex. They have been through hell and back, but they never give up.The City of Mirrors is an absolutely stunning finale to the trilogy. There\u2019s just no way my words can come close to expressing its brilliance. This trilogy will without a doubt always stay with me.I seriously can\u2019t believe it\u2019s over. I remember threatening Justin Cronin in my review of The Twelve that I was going to haunt him if I died before this book was released. Happy to say that I\u2019m still alive 3.5 years later, and Cronin is safe from my cold spots.Btw, I'm not a rereader. The previous books in this trilogy were actually the first ones I've ever truly reread. I will say, I appreciated The Passage even more after having all the info from The Twelve. I was able to catch so much more, especially all the little threads that connected them. It also wasn't as laborious. Believe me, getting through The Passage the first time was almost torturous at times, but it was a totally different experience the 2nd time around. So, if it's been years between books for you, I suggest rereading. You'll be glad you did."}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "I have no clue why I read these over-long dang books. Yes, I do. I'm totally blaming Edward Lorn..he started these chunky books and started posting status updates. I had them sitting on my bookshelf and then he kept making me want to know what was going on. So I dived in. I sorta liked the first book even though Justin Cronin is the writingnest muttha ever. The man loves to make some words. Once I started this series, I liked it. I didn't love it, but there was something about the whole thing that drew me in and I couldn't stop reading. The second book was the best in my opinion..but look what happened to my buddy reader. here.\n(It's okay though, he totally made up for it with another buddy read of some horror-porn that had me rolling-you can see that here and here -you are welcome)Now for this final chapter (Hallelujah) of this series. It's been years since they kicked the \"Twelve's\" booty and life is good. Baby Caleb is all grown up and married. Peter has moved up politically. Michael is off being obsessed with a big old boat. Amy hasn't been seen but she is still appearing in people's dreams. I remember wondering about the guy that started this whole hot mess in the last book. Timothy Fanning aka Zero. I even posted in my review that I wanted to know what he was up too..I wanted more about him. \nYes, we find out. Justin Cronin style. I'm filing Zero on my taxes this year just because I know so much about him. That's one thing about this series. You do know the characters. You do get attached to them. It feels like you are right in the mist of the drama with them. That part I love. I just hate that it takes so much filler to get you there. I shouldn't bitch though, because if I ever get stuck on a desert island this whole series would definitely keep me entertained. \nCronin also wrapped up loose ends, which I greatly appreciate.I'm glad that I read them.

I think this is the first time I've really wanted a .5 option.Cronin's concluding volume in his post-apocalyptic vampire saga is a lovely novel. Lovely! Such an odd word to use for a book describing the slaughter of hundreds of thousands and the death of billions more by airborne plague. But this is indeed an often lovely book because Cronin is at this point almost completely disinterested in horror. Or terror, or the darkness in human souls, or the abyss that we look into that looks right back 'atcha. He wants to write about families and the light within souls and the way that people can come together when things fall apart. He wants to write about a bright and shining future that is still a human future - and therefore fallible, uncertain. He wants to understand and humanize and empathize with darkness so that it is no longer so dark, but rather something relatable and knowable. He wants to write about hope. And so he did.The prior books each included a lengthy, more than novella-sized portion set before the Fall of Man. Each of those prior parts were full of action, blood, and danger. Not so much with the sequence set pre-Fall in this book; this flashback is all about the life of a smart, often disaffected young man with a distant father, going away to college, learning to love, learning the pain of a lost love, and all the while trying to forge his own unique identity. It could have been written by John Updike. This part is all about the man who became Zero - the ultimate villain of the series. And yet it is not about a villain, it is just about a man, and the choices and mistakes he makes in his life. A man who later becomes an undead killer and who purposely brings about the apocalypse in order to somehow fill the gaping hole where his heart used to be. A monstrous horror, but still a man.Cronin fumbles a bit in his portrait of series protagonist Peter Jaxon, and a bit with the series' heart Sarah. I doubt he wanted to turn either of them into mulishly stubborn assholes who refuse to empathize with their childhood friend's trauma, how their friend sacrificed who she was for the greater good, how she was exploited and abused physically, mentally, emotionally... but that's what happened and that's how they reacted. I really came to dislike the often selfish, stupid person Peter became and was disappointed in Sarah too. Did Cronin want me to dislike them? I just don't think so. Ah well. Humans often fail when it comes to empathy and they amply illustrated that failing.The book has one genuine horror set piece: an extended attack on humanity's last haven (in Texas, of course). When Cronin wants to bring the terror, he can bring it. That was a hair-raising handful of chapters. Also worth noting is the lengthy epilogue. Despite being set a thousand years from now, it is basically the story of an older man trying to understand himself, trying to understand his son, perhaps falling in love again, and trying to figure out who he is anyway, after all his years of living. A moving story but perhaps not a unique one. But uniquely positioned. What a surprising epilogue! It has nothing to do with horror and everything to do with being human.The poetic flourishes that were a key part of the first book but were somewhat lacking (or hackneyed) in the second book return in full force for the third book. Cronin is a beautifully lyrical writer, whether he is writing about the love between mother and daughter or the way a homestead looks and feels or the sadness buried within his undead monsters. The City of Mirrors is beautifully written, with many passages worthy of a happy sigh simply because of the gorgeous artistry of the prose.Beyond the beauty of the writing is the innate soulfulness of this novel - of the entire trilogy. This may not be my favorite (that would be the 5 star The Passage), but it is still a very impressive achievement. And the impressiveness lies within the novel's delicacy and the way his characters resonated with me, in their longing for community and family and a way of living that feels true and natural and good.It's funny, I was thinking about this novel over the Thanksgiving weekend, which is an odd time to think about a post-apocalyptic vampire novel. I'm a singleton (and hopefully always will be) but during this holiday, I like to get together with a few families and rent a big place to enjoy each other's company and watch the kids run amok and eat lots of food together. This past Thanksgiving was no different. One night after everyone had retired, I sat on a balcony in a contemplative mood, looking out at the treetops moving in the wind and the stars gleaming above them, the sound of the hot tub bubbling away in the background, a soft chilly wind blowing leaves around the various kid toys and clothes and shoes strewn here and there. I thought of the beasts of this trilogy, dropping from the trees to hunt, their souls still trapped within and longing for relief and release. I thought about how Cronin somehow humanized them, made them symbolic of how all humans have a melancholy longing for understanding and connection, sometimes buried deep within, but always there. I thought of his brave, imperfect human characters, always wanting to be together, always hoping and loving and longing, making bad decisions and making good ones, but mainly acting from a need for connection and from a need to make a life with others, and for others. Cronin sees the best in people, even at their worst. I thought that was an excellent way to look at people: always with empathy, no matter how monstrous or fallible or weak a person may be. Look at people, see them; draw them into your life, go into theirs; be together. It was a good Thanksgiving thought."}, {"userName": "Margaret Small", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24804496-margaret-small", "userReview": "Give the guy a break, he's writing a huge book no doubt, and I'd rather he got it right than finished it early.

I loved every moment of tension in this compelling and terrifying plot. What made this such a great trilogy for me was how Cronin was able to draw me into the story with such a large cast of characters, and had me emotionally engaged, caring for them and rooting for their survival. In The City of Mirrors we see how our characters and the next generation of characters have dealt and found their place after the events of The Twelve. It started off a bit slow for me, and we see our characters have found some peace before all hell breaks loose and the virals are back. That's when it got exciting and really good for me. From then on I was on the edge of my seat till the roaring, grisly, big event with a big payoff. I would recommend reading all three books close together to really bond and see how these well developed characters grow and change in their fight to survive in such a terrifying world.All of Norma's and my reviews can be found on our sister blog.http://www.twogirlslostinacouleereadi..."}, {"userName": "Grigory Lukin", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7346184-grigory-lukin", "userReview": "Justin Cronin's \"The Passage\" trilogy reminds me of DC's comic book movies: the premise is great, but each new installment is grittier, darker and makes less sense than the one before it.I'll start with a warning: if you have any sort of trauma-related emotional triggers, the first 60 pages of \"The city of mirrors\" will pull them, seemingly just for the fun of it. In the very first chapters of the book, we encounter (in no particular order) a stillbirth, a series of rape-related flashbacks, a man telepathically cheating on his girlfriend, a sexually abused little girl, and a religious hermit who goes to wander in the desert and then either gets extremely lucky by finding a bona fide treasure or loots an emergency supply station while presumably leaving the next stranded traveler to die.I honestly can't tell why Cronin chose to assault his readers like this. It's possible that he tried to shove as much potential shock value as possible to make the book more memorable (though not in a good way) - at one point in the book, there's a fairly detailed description of live birth. (Not quite what one expects in what's supposed to be a vampire book.) On the other hand, it's possible he was just trying to pad the page count. \"The city of mirrors\" appears to be the shortest book in the trilogy, and that's after all the shameless padding and all the hundreds of pages spent describing nothing in general.In the middle of the book, there's a 200-page novel in which Zero, the original viral, corners one of our plucky heroes and shares his origin story in a very unexpected, out-of-context way. Is it possible that Cronin always wanted to write a \"coming of age\" story and decided to force-feed it to his readers? Or was it just something gathering dust in his desk drawer that seemed good enough to turn a 400-page book into a heavy 600-pager?Regardless, the notion of a 150-year-old vampire moaning about his lost college girlfriend is ridiculous, especially considering that his audience consists of a single person who grew up with only the most basic education and who wouldn't be able to grasp even the most basic concepts - things like tenure or airplanes or upper-class socioeconomic class. The story would have been much more realistic and fun if Zero would have to stop every 5 minutes and explain what things meant, but nope, we're all subjected to a ridiculously out-of-place stream of consciousness. (Can you imagine tracking down a rural bumpkin from the year 1900 and telling them about your computer problems? Yeah, it's *that* ridiculous.)I might have been able to overlook all of the above and give the book a weak 4-star rating, but there are far too many plot holes and, dare I say, poor writing for a book that's been in the works for 4 years. Just a handful of examples off the top of my head... A 35-year-old horse can run as fast as a group of virals. A character goes for a long swim and produces a perfectly dry book of matches from their pocket. A deaf person devises their own sign language - so advanced that even \"War and peace\" can be translated into it. Automatic rifles last just fine for 120 years before suddenly starting to break down due to advanced age. Two people that discover potentially world-ending piece of news choose not to tell everyone but instead launch a sociopathic murderous cult that involves dozens of people over the course of 21 years, none of whom say a word to anybody. (Every spy agency's dream!) A person that's never been on a boat learns how to operate a cruise ship in less than a month. People of the future can't tell the difference between 870 and 1,000 years. After restarting civilization, 870 years later the pinnacle of their technological achievement is dirigibles and flashbulb cameras. (Must have been all the inbreeding.) Virals discover brand new powers that can't be explained by any virus and turn into shapeshifters. Half the characters in the book develop superpowers - either telepathic abilities that are ever so convenient, or the ability to run for 30 minutes while bleeding from an artery without any lasting damage.If I sound just a little bit upset, it's because I've spent 2 weeks of my life struggling to finish this book, waiting for a payoff at the end, but it never came. I downgrade the book to 2 stars for the most ridiculously stretched-out ending I have ever had the displeasure to read. It's yet another novella about people we don't know, doing things we don't care about, who end up lecturing us about the things we already know and, in the end, do something so extremely stupid (but pretty and sentimental - yay!) that the entire struggle appears to have been for naught.On the upside, the language of the book is occasionally moving and often beautiful. That is, of course, when it's not talking about child rape, stillbirths, murderous cults, shapeshifting vampires, shapeshifting humans, shapeshifting vampires that become humans or shapeshifting humans that become vampires but then change their minds and switch back to being humans.I give this book 2 out of 5 stars.Full disclosure: I've received the advanced reader copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "A brilliant ending to a thoroughly enjoyable trilogy.

Honestly, I don't even know where to begin. So much was woven together, carefully plotted, planned, and executed and it showed in every single sentence, paragraph, and page. This book was like a magical journey to another time and place that you get so immersed in, so caught up in that you lose time while in it. The real world around you disappears and there is nothing but the world that he has created for you and thrown you into. It isn't like other books in its genre. It stands out. It's unique, creative, imaginative, and well designed and I couldn't of been happier with the way it all came together and came about. The way information, facts, and details slowly all came together, made sense, and most of all, was brilliantly laid out.

She\u201d \u2015 Justin Cronin, The PassageI wish I had to re-read The Passage and The Twelve prior to reading this one. A lot of time has passed, and so it was with this book too - a lot of time has passed. I believe 20 years for the characters. They have aged, their children have aged and so the story begins with them at this stage of their lives.Virals have not been seen for a long time but that does not mean they have been forgotten. Survivors have gotten on with their lives. Some content to go one with their lives believing the worst was behind them and some moving on but always watching for signs of a return. A return, that once it came, would come full force.\u201cSorry, we made vampires; it seemed like a good idea at the time.\u201d \u2015 Justin Cronin, The TwelveTo get to the ending, let's start with the beginning. The Passage grabbed me from the get go. It was an emotional page turner for me. I LOVED that book. I could not read it fast enough. Once finished, as usual, I was angry I read it so fast. I waited and waited and waited for the next in the series to come out. Then The Twelve came out. I didn't love it as much as The Passage, but I still thought it was very good. As I read it, I was drawn back into the world of Peter, Amy, Sara, Hollis, Michael, Alicia, etc. We learned more about The Twelve (fitting since that was the title) and although not a page turner for me, it drew me in and kept me wanting more.Then the waiting began for the last in the series to come out. When I got the confirmation email from Netgalley that I was chosen, I am not ashamed to say I got very, very excited. I may have ever yelled out \"Yes!\" and \"I got it!!\" I could not wait to read this. I really appreciated the beginning with the notes on who was who. It was a nice refresher as some time had gone by between books.But then I found myself reading other books while reading this in the beginning. Why? Because this book starts off SLOW. Very Slow for me. Finally when I started getting into this book, the background on Fanning began. I know some readers feel this part would have been better told as a novella. Maybe... maybe not but it did slow things down and disrupted the story. I wish Fanning's story would have been told at the beginning of this book, before we are re-introduced to all of the characters I have grown to love. Fanning's story is necessary. It shows him as a person, a young man who feels he is given the shaft by his father as he goes away to Harvard where he meets Jonas Lear and Liz. All characters are likable. I liked young Fanning. His story is tragic and one can't help but feel sorry for him. His back story is important. How does a normal guy turn into a monster? I just wish it was better placed in the book.After Fanning's background story, the \"Story\" of the characters began. This is where the story picked up for me and I put the other books away, Cronin had grasped my attention once again. How to rate without re-telling the entire story?? That is always the question for me. I will say I loved the farmstead story of Peter and Amy. I love that Peter went there every night. I loved their connection. I loved seeing the characters again. I liked seeing Michael and Alicia interacting again, Sara and Hollis, Peter and Amy. Then there is Caleb and Pim. They have a great story line as well. I also liked the Amy/Cater story line. All nice touches. Cronin was very true to his characters and saw them through to the end. \u201cAll stories end when they have returned to their beginnings.\u201d \u2015 Justin Cronin, The City of MirrorsThe ending became a page turner. Four people to face fanning and his Virals. What would happen? This was a great way to end - heart pounding action. Who would live who would die? and of course there would be beautiful passages, declarations of love, such humanity intertwined with such horror.\u201cAll his life he had wanted to be known by just one person. That\u2019s what love was, he decided. Love was being known.\u201d \u2015 Justin Cronin, The City of MirrorsWhat would I have wished would have happened? In the end, Amy and Peter on the farmstead yet again. We see Carter get his \"ever after\", hell even Fanning is reunited with Liz. I would have loved for the last lines of the book to be Amy playing piano with Peter standing behind her, hands on her shoulders. Fan-fiction on my behalf I am sure.I think Cronin did a great job ending his series. A great dystopian series that is also a love story. Cronin stayed true to his characters and gave his readers a great ending. I shed some tears along the way. We see characters we know die, some live, some change, but the story is always good. Slow in the beginning but stay with this book. See it through, Keep reading,it is well worth it. Cronin has never disappointed and he does not disappoint here. He is a gifted and beautiful writer. His talent shines as a city of mirrors would shine - brightly. Having finished this series, I want to go back and re-read it all over again. I can't say that for many series or books, but this one's a keeper.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "City of Mirrors is going to be an incredibly hard book to review with any sense of professionalism, such was its impact and indeed the impact of this entire trilogy on me as a reader.

These are the reads we live for.Lets go back a little\u2026because Something is coming...Ok so maybe on a slightly more practical note we\u2019ll see how we go \u2013 The Passage was my read of the year in its year \u2013 echoes of King when he plots to perfection, a pre apocalyptic post apocalyptic magnum opus in the making, with characters that take up residence inside your head and linger there and a truly magnificent piece of storytelling that was fascinating, horrifying, so strangely possible in a lot of ways that it was scary as all hell. But also beautiful, intriguing, extraordinarily clever and a book that rewarded readers in surprising and unexpected ways. The Passage on its own was epic. A truly remarkable achievement.Then\u2026.Fear the dark\u2026We moved onto \u201cThe Twelve\u201d. Now I think its fair to say that some readers who loved The Passage had issues with The Twelve. Not everyone loved it. Some didn\u2019t think it was as good. I had endless discussions with other readers of this trilogy about how The Twelve took us away from the Passage rather than moving it on, changed things too much \u2013 but for me it worked on every level. I could kind of see what the author was up to, the middle novel, the one that is often the \u201clesser\u201d for me in this case was more than. Much more than.To my mind The Twelve had a gorgeous sense of anticipation to it. That is the best way I can put it. Again, no real detail. You must, simply MUST read these for yourself. Also in defence of The Twelve, to those who were not sure of it, I think that if you reread it in its place, after The Passage, before City of Mirrors it will take on an entirely different sense and an entirely different vibe. I refer you back to Justin Cronin being a genius.Now\u2026Its time.And here we are now then. Its time. The City of Mirrors completes this story, we will have to say goodbye to Amy and Sarah and Peter and Alicia and oh all of them too many to mention, including every one of The Twelve,those stunningly layered and well drawn characters who have captured our imagination, made us root for them, had us holding our breath, or hiding under the duvet or upon reading a particuarly thrilling moment clutching our heads in dismay and concern. The relationships created and lost, the world they live in an ever changing landscape, so intimately imagined you live there with them, time lost, time gained, the whole wonderful, creative, genuinely absorbing, intensely insane reading MADNESS of it, it is done.And done in such a way that you will absolutely never forget it. This trilogy I will read again, start to finish, many times. Many many times. Justin Cronin has taken hold of my reading soul and won\u2019t let go easily. And at the end of City of Mirrors I realised that even if I read it all 20 times I\u2019m still going to find little nuances, little bits of foreshadowing little moments that I missed in the sheer joy of reading it, this is a trilogy that itself will be an ever changing landscape upon revisiting it.Be prepared. Expect the unexpected. It will still surprise you. Everything you have read before within this story you will look at very differently when you have finished City of Mirrors. I cannot imagine that it could be better. We had to wait for this and trust me trust me it was worth every MOMENT of that wait. Every chronically impatient moment of it. Ok so I havent been that practical. I can\u2019t tell you about the technical stuff, I CERTAINLY can\u2019t break down the plot and tell you what works and what doesnt and why it should do this and where it falters because for ME it never faltered. Not for one moment. I LIVED it. And Died in it. Then lived in it once more. Every page. Every word.That is what reading is about. Isnt it?Do I need to say Highly Recommended? Pfft. You know the score. Justin Cronin I thank you.And as for Amy, the Girl from Nowhere \u2013 I have no words."}, {"userName": "LeeAnn Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15623155-leeann-taylor", "userReview": "4/6/2015Guys.

He honestly blurted me out of the null figure because so much of description that it seemed to me too exaggerated at times. By me the writer could shorten the book for at least one hundred pages, but who am I to touch his writing style. But the story is still very well elaborated; the story takes us back and leads through the Viral world where people are powerless to resist this mighty force. All in all a solid ending of the series, all fans of the series will not be disappointed, because this is a very good book. It would recommend a whole series to horror lovers, the post-apocalyptic world, and the vampire.

Who would think a novel with such gorgeous imagery and fully developed characters was about mankind trying to survive a world full of homicidal vampire-like creatures. Because the second book, The Twelve, came out four years ago, the author has included a clever prologue that brings the reader up to speed. Under the guise of a presentation given at a global conference 1003 years AV (after virus), the writing from \u201cThe Book of Twelves\u201d is almost biblical in its disposition. And it isn\u2019t until the end of the novel that the reader understands the source of the Book of Twelves. The book then begins close to twenty years after the death of the Twelve. No virals have been sighted since. But, the Republic of Texas has remained within the enclosed town of Kerrville and, after so many years, it\u2019s bursting at the seams with citizens. The president makes a decision: it\u2019s time to allow people to move beyond the gates that have remained open for the last two decades. It\u2019s time for Manifest Destiny.We learn what has become of Alicia of Blades, Michael, Peter, Lucius, Sara and Caleb as they live scattered throughout North America. But since the death of the Twelve, no one has seen Amy. Many see her in their dreams. Some have visions that are attributed to Amy. Most assume she died that day in the arena. Then the book takes an unusual turn in its narrative. One of the characters hears the voice of Zero, the first patient who contracted the virus that destroyed the world, and finds he lives in Grand Central Station. We are then brought back in time and find out how biochemical genius, Tim Fanning, became patient Zero. It\u2019s an interesting backstory that takes time to complete, but it gives the reader a better understanding of how a scientist with a rather sad personal life became a megalomaniacal monster.As the pages turn and time goes by, the reader will keep wondering, \u201cwhere are the virals?\u201d Do not worry. About halfway through the book, you will learn what happened to them and why it took forty years for them to come back. Ingenious planning on Zero\u2019s part, by the way.The solution to save the remaining humans, using a story straight from the bible, is also ingenious. By the end of the book, we know what becomes of Alicia, Peter, Michael, Lucius, Sara and Caleb, and Zero. And Amy. Each ends their story in a way that makes sense for their character, as it should. Some are sad, some are peaceful, but Amy\u2019s is perfect. Her story comes full circle and is beautiful. And, the epilogue reminded me so much of epilogue for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, a similarity that many readers have noted.While I loved this book, the last chapter of the epilogue is long and drawn-out and, to me, not necessary. Introducing a totally new character and giving the reader the extraneous lowdown on the guy\u2019s life annoyed me. Yes, he plays a part in wrapping up the story, but I really don\u2019t care about his love life or his gracious ex-wife, etc. I\u2019m also not totally clear on why Zero was so obsessed with Amy. I have some ideas, but I\u2019m not completely connecting the dots on that part.A beautiful piece of literary fiction, The City of Mirrors is amazing, complex, well written, and the characters will stick with the reader for days. I even found myself rereading parts of it just for the writing.

Part II reviews the trilogy as a whole.)Part ISeries authors take note: this is how you write a finale. The City of Mirrors not only ties up the trilogy well but brings it beautifully full circle. Cronin connected the third book to the other two with enough references and familiar characters but made it distinct enough that nothing feels repetitious. Twists and surprises abound; leaps in time work well, never feeling jarring; no new characters are extraneous. The City of Mirrors is more unlike than like The Twelve, though the writing is just as sharp. Cronin is the kind of author who thoughtfully selects words without overdoing it. This translates to a story that\u2019s a full, balanced experience. This isn\u2019t a genre story that sacrifices quality writing for story nor is this pages of turgid prose that shows off rather than tells much of a story. What makes The City of Mirrors stand out from The Passage and The Twelve--and makes it a vital installment--is its villain, lovingly crafted and one of the most well-realized characters across all three books. He\u2019s multi-dimensional, with a heart-shattering, psychologically complex backstory portraying a breathtaking vulnerability. This is a lengthy chapter that somehow feels way too short. To say more would be to spoil what\u2019s easily The City of Mirrors\u2019s strongest section, but those unsure about whether to read book three should do it for this; that backstory alone makes The City of Mirrors worth reading. As is true of The Twelve, Cronin\u2019s descriptions in The City of Mirrors tend to linger, whether that\u2019s spending too much time in characters\u2019 heads or describing, say, a sunset. Descriptions of the outdoors and cityscapes in particular are excessive. These are only interesting when focused on scenes of destruction--how the land has been ravaged by virals and how nature has overtaken what humankind made--otherwise, they\u2019re dull, make the pacing uneven, and simply aren\u2019t always necessary. There\u2019s also, like in The Twelve, an extremely long final action sequence that\u2019s impossible to envision well. Some question marks hang in the air--see specific questions here (Note: Major spoilers in the questions): https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/... ; nevertheless, Cronin was admirably meticulous overall, and considering how many story threads, backstories, tiny details, and characters he had to juggle across three huge books, that\u2019s simply stunning. Additionally, there\u2019s one small element left open-ended that will make some speculate but not others. It seems clear the trilogy is over. There will be no fourth book, and that\u2019s how it needs to be for what\u2019s here to be just right. The City of Mirrors is stupendous, a nearly flawless wrap-up to a first-rate epic. Part IIThe Passage trilogy isn\u2019t about vampires exactly, at least not in the way many people think when they think of vampire stories. These vampires most definitely aren\u2019t of the Edward Cullen variety or  Bill and Eric variety. They aren\u2019t of the Dracula variety either. Cronin took a little here and a little there from different horror sources, and crafted an end-of-the world horror-fantasy about a pandemic that has echoes of the nonfiction The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus. Those who don\u2019t like vampire stories, think again. This isn\u2019t \u201canother vampire story.\u201d Cronin developed his human characters as much as his monsters, maybe more. Cronin plotted this trilogy from book one. The story arc therefore extends perfectly across all three books, concluding naturally in book three. Clues dropped and storylines begun in books one and two continue and are fleshed out fully in book three. Readers need to go in order; this is a must, as the books will be incomprehensible otherwise. These aren\u2019t capsules. It\u2019s also ideal--imperative--to read them back-to-back or at least very close in time. These contain many moving parts, and to wait too long between them is to forget numerous crucial details; furthermore, reading the books close in time packs the biggest punch. For those who did read them back-to-back, it can even be rewarding to go back to book one and reread at least part one of that. Cronin\u2019s trilogy has proven to be on a much more elevated plane than others in the genre. There\u2019s enough here to attract all kinds of readers, including those who normally eschew science fiction, horror, fantasy, or post-apocalyptic stories. There\u2019s also enough artistry in Cronin\u2019s writing to attract lovers of literary fiction. It\u2019s truly a trilogy that can\u2019t be summed up well, and that wouldn\u2019t do it justice anyway. Final verdict: The vampire trilogy for those who dislike vampire stories. A must-read now.

This is because the story essentially culminated at the end of the last one, with the destruction of The Twelve and the disappearance of Amy.Therefore I was quite curious to see what type of rabbit Cronin would pull out of the hat with the conclusion. Some of it is predictable, such as revisiting earlier events \u2013 a particular standout set-piece in this regard is the back story of Zero and the discovery of the virus.A lot of Cronin\u2019s achievement here is far more subtle though, fleshing out characters and bits and pieces of the story from before, adding unexpected weight and meaning to events perceived quite differently previously. Now that is a true sequel.What I particularly liked is how Cronin broadens both his vision and story here, to answer two particular questions nagging readers since book one: what happened to the rest of America, and indeed the rest of the world?The answers are unexpected and thrilling, culminating in both a nail-biting ending and an elegiac coda that provides an extraordinary meditation on the meaning of love and history."}, {"userName": "Smeg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16328095-smeg", "userReview": "My anticipation deserves five stars!"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202724-jessica", "userReview": "So. The grand finale. The End. And a very satisfactory ending it was, too. An exciting adventure, with plenty of romance and explosions and tragedy. And it was certainly better than the last one. I have this memory of The Twelve being kind of a slog. I remember being frustrated with the format, where every chapter seemed to be the backstory of a different character, leading up to a quick scene of action before heading into the next backstory. That format is gone here, and the backstory that we do get is just as interesting as the action, if not more so. And I say more so because . . . Well, to be honest, these books are problematic. I love the story. I love the premise. But basically, thanks to what I will go ahead and call Cronin's \"fancy pants writing\" (hat tip to my sister for that), I feel like he's convinced us that these books are better than they actually are. They're written in a very literary style, which is (let's face it) unusual for both post apocalyptic and vampire novels. And since these books are so classy, and written so fancy, he lulls us into thinking that there's no way that there could be a plot hole. Or that a character might be two-dimensional. I honestly started to think it was my fault that the science didn't make sense, and that I just couldn't empathize with the one character at all. And then I thought, Wait, isn't it the writer's job to make me care about the characters? Isn't it the writer's (or possibly the editor's) to make sure that the science doesn't take hugely illogical leaps? The book has a winning combination of science and magic going on, which is great until he breaks his own rules. Which is . . . frustrating as a reader and a writer. I loved the characters. (Except for Alicia, I know she's supposed to be this amazing heroine but . . . nope. Never liked her. Cronin's in love with her, but I see no reason to be.) I was anxious about what was going to happen. Would our heroes save the day? Would mankind survive? After three books and probably around 1,500 pages I was ready for the payoff. And I got it. I got the ending I wanted, though it came about in delightfully unexpected ways. But again, frustration, because at times there were leaps over years and sudden bursts of magic that left the characters themselves shrugging over what had happened, in order to get to that great ending. Now, with three books and so many pages to work with, I would imagine that Cronin could have laid more groundwork so that this ending could have come about more organically. I guess I was supposed to be so dazzled by his prose that I didn't notice, but I did. So overall I loved the series, and I think it's going to up there with the best of Stephen King and the like. But I guess I just need to point out that this is not a perfect book. On a side note, this book contained something that I'm becoming increasingly aware of in futuristic fiction that I find amusing. That is: the few salvaged books that have survived the apocalypse are 19th century classics by white male authors. Why is it, when the world falls apart, all that is left is Tolstoy? Melville? Dickens? Shakespeare? I swear, if people aren't finding comparisons between their own lives and Moby-Dick, then it's Hamlet. (And the Shakespeare reference is ALWAYS Hamlet! How about a zombie outbreak comparison to Much Ado?!) Do you know what books will actually be so ubiquitous that they'll be in every Postapocalyptic Library? Harry Potter. Twilight. The Fault in Our Stars. The Hunger Games. But if we must throw in a classic, how come nobody ever finds a copy of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and compares their life to it? Or One Hundred Years of Solitude? And how come nobody in the future ever thinks that Narnia is real, or that Percy Jackson is scripture? And what's happened to all the James Patterson books? I mean, seriously: he puts out roughly twenty books a year! Some of them must have survived! Or Agatha Christie? How about some Michael Crichton, for heaven's sake! John Grisham, maybe?Nobody ever finds a copy of Dracula, which would be a better comparison than War and Peace. Or Interview with the Vampire. Maybe we're all hoping to rebuild society on a solid foundation of British Literature, but let's face it: we're far more likely to be teaching our future generations to read using Diary of a Wimpy Kid than A Tale of Two Cities."}, {"userName": "Wayne Barrett", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21372390-wayne-barrett", "userReview": "4.5The City of Mirrors, being the final chapter to 'The Passage' trilogy was a great finish to what I consider one of the better series/trilogy's I have read in some time. Following the descendants of the human race that was left over from a virus that nearly brought humankind to extinction, along with a couple of others who had been there since the beginning, the City of Mirrors tells of the reemergence of those called, \"virals\", and the battle for survival of the remaining group. Peter Jackson, Amy, and a viral known as \"Zero\" come to a final meeting in a culmination of chaos, horror, heartbreak and hope.I don't want to get ahead of myself in summing up the trilogy but considering I had to exert a lot of patience to get through the first book, The City of Mirrors is one of those conclusions where I did not want the story to end. This book had depth, character, and a ton of power and though I can see where it may not be for some, I personally thought this was a great book and an altogether great trilogy.If you take the time and research the reviews on this series you will notice a lot of people have it listed on their 'vampire' shelf, and I am one of them. There is a definite parallel between the characteristics and habits of those infected who are known as virals to the creatures of myth we know as vampires. Some in the story even refer to them as \"Drac's\" because they were able to watch the old Dracula movie and made the connection. But be warned, do not approach this solely based on a desire to read a vampire series, especially if you envision stereotypical ideas about the genre. I do believe it can be shelved as a vampire theme, but it is unique, one of the things I think makes it a great story.As a whole, I would give the trilogy a 4.5 star rating. As I mentioned earlier, There was a lot of patience required in the first book because I felt like Cronin continued to veer away from stories that I was just starting to get really interested in, and moving on to other characters and times that didn't seem to make any sense at first. Not to mention that every time he did so he went into excruciating details on those characters. Well, as it turns out, if you give it time, all those side stories and characters meld into a plot that is just fantastic. And because of the details there is a great depth to the story and characters. Reminiscent of some of Stephen Kings works, 'Needful Things', 'Under the Dome', 'The Passage' trilogy is a mass of alternate times, places, and characters, but Cronin did such a masterful job in detailing it and bringing it together that when read together makes this an epic trilogy. Just know going in that you may feel lost at times during the start but that in time it will all come together and you will be on one hell of a ride."}, {"userName": "Susie DelMa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47283214-susie-delma", "userReview": "Ich liebe die Story einfach \u2764...Aber der schreibstil ist immer noch krass"}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "\u201cCity of memories, city of mirrors. Am I alone? Yes and no. I am a man of many descendants.\u201d\nThe year is 101 A.V. and three years have passed since the elimination of the Twelve, three years since any viral has been sighted and 100 thousand people are living comfortably behind the secure walls of Kerrville, Texas. But after three years it\u2019s easy to start thinking that they\u2019re finally safe, that they don\u2019t have to remain behind this wall because there\u2019s nothing left to fear. And that\u2019s exactly what the citizens of Kerrville do, they pack up their belongings and seek out a new home, beyond the wall, because it\u2019s no longer a necessity for safety. It\u2019s almost too late before they realize that maybe what they thought was safety was nothing but a mirage.\n\u2018A world of souls, both the living and the dead, in which time and space, memory and desire, existed in a purely fluid state, the way they did in dreams.\u2019\nFrom the very beginning, we\u2019re made aware that the world does in fact survive this catastrophe that has consumed the world. The City of Mirrors opens with a reading from what is known as \u201cThe Book of Twelves\u201c, a journal that was discovered that to some extent explains the virus and its origins, which is being presented at the Third Global Conference on the North American Quarantine Period. The year is 1003 A.V. (After Virus) So no matter how unlikely survival seems to be amidst the ongoing battle, we can rest assured with the knowledge that human kind manages to find a way to survive. This certainly doesn\u2019t lessen the agitation in wondering who exactly does survive.Completing this trilogy was clearly an immense undertaking and despite being upset it took as long as it did to come to fruition (it was originally anticipated that each book would be released every other year so technically we were supposed to get this back in 2014, but whatever, I\u2019ll let it go), I can certainly understand it. After all, the three books combined are close to 2,000 pages total. I read The Passage when it was first published in 2010 and it was such an incredibly impressive book that I still remember being in complete awe of Cronin\u2019s talents. The Twelve came out two years later and I was manic about getting my hands on a copy. I was supremely disappointed once I did. The Twelve was such a vastly different change of pace and it felt like nothing but an incredibly huge filler book. Having no idea what to expect from The City of Mirrors, I still picked this one up with both trepidation and confidence. I was pretty conflicted emotionally. And even after finishing it I still am slightly.Cronin did a remarkable job at re-introducing characters we\u2019ve all come to know and love and giving them their much deserved endings. There seemed to be quite a lot of time spent on characters that didn\u2019t seem to be of much consequence which only added to the already massive page length. But the plot was the real reason for page length if we\u2019re placing blame. It was a slow build which was at first off-putting since personally I went into this thinking we\u2019d be in for some massive battle at a rapid pace. In truth, that action I was anticipating didn\u2019t actually happen until the midway point of this 624 page tome. But up until that point, we\u2019re shown a typical day in Kerrville. And more and more typical days. There\u2019s Michael and his seemingly impossible plan to save the world that he\u2019s been working towards for over two decades. Peter. Alicia. Amy. Sara. They all have stories to tell. And of course, Zero. Before, when his name was Fanning. When he was a student at Harvard University in the late 1980s. Before he traveled to South America and became the only surviving carrier of the virus that brought the world to near ruin. We\u2019re given his complete story in an attempt to bring him to the forefront when he has always been nothing more than a background villain. To give reason to his madness after death was an interesting addition, and while his story was reasonably moving, this is a character that we\u2019ve never seen play a part as a human being. He has always been the ultimate danger, the reason human kind was near decimated, and to humanize him was irrelevant because he was no longer human. His life and who he was \u201cbefore\u201d was inconsequential.While the lead up was slow-going and it started lagging again towards the near end, Cronin still ends this apocalyptic tale on an excellent note. We\u2019re given more details about the Global Conference that took place, the knowledge that they do and don\u2019t possess of the virus that destroyed the world, and the fascinating archaeological records. My advanced reader copy didn\u2019t contain the actual art/photographs but it is referenced in the epilogue that various aerial photographs, microscopic slides of the virus found in human remains, and maps of the past and current world are included. I\u2019m interested enough to pick up the real copy and do a re-read of the epilogue just for that extra tidbit. This installment might not have left me completely satisfied, but I can\u2019t deny that this was still a solid trilogy about an apocalyptic world I hope never to find myself in the middle of. The descriptive details of how the virus came to infect its first host is a scientific terror that is alarmingly probable. I also can\u2019t deny that Cronin is one skillful author that has an unbelievable way with words. I can\u2019t wait to see what new world he invents next.\n\u2018The song was like a sonic embodiment of pure emotion. There was a deep heartache inside its phrases, but the feeling was expressed with such tenderness that it did not seem sad. It made him think of the way time felt, always falling into the past, becoming memory.\u2019\n3.5 of 5 starsI received this book free from the Publisher in exchange for an honest review.

Since last book, the war with Virals is over and humanity is just starting to crawl out from the rock it has lived under for the last 100 years. All the old gang is here but a little older. And in some cases a little bit different. (Cryptic comment intended).Author does a great job of getting us caught up. Are the Virals gone? What do you think? We learn about Zero. I didn't see this coming. I had kind of figured he would be center stage but I didn't realize we would learn his history and learn about him as a human. I have very mixed emotions about this. No doubt this is well written but I do not want to feel any sympathy for the guy. But needless to say all is revealed.The tension builds slowly and methodically. You think you know what's going to happen but you just can't figure out when. As has been previously the case, the writing is character driven. Keep in mind this is the last of a trilogy, so you know...read it last. Justin Cronin can write whatever genre he wants, he's just that good. But I hope he stays in this arena. Thank you NetGallery for the book in exchange for honest review."}], "description": "The world we knew is gone. What world will rise in its place?
