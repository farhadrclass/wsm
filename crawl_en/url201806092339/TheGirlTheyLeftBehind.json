So in 1960 when Victor gave Natalia an airplane ticket to Geneva and New York, she was not sure what would be waiting for her there.

The author has no knowledge of what happened to her biological grandparents but she did have a relationship with Anton and Despina, her adopted grandparents."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8644428-lynn", "userReview": "How far would you go to save the life of the daughter you love? If you are Jewish in Romania when Hitler invades, what heart-wrenching decisions would you be willing to make?
