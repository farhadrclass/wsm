Little Broken Things is a story filled with emotion, tension, and domestic drama. The book itself had some dark secrets spilled into the narrative and did manage to maintain an overall heavy feel, but I would still characterize this as a lighter read in the sense that it didn\u2019t contain the graphic violence that many readers like to avoid. If you enjoy suspenseful mysteries without all the added grotesque flair, this one is for you!The story is told through multiple POVs that were easy to follow; I found it an intriguing way to reveal the secrets and story piece by piece to the reader, a clever twist in itself. The characters were very onion like; not necessarily everyone will like them but they are multilayered and add flavor to the book. Personally, I thought they brought the story to an entirely advanced level and appreciate what the author accomplished; knowing her background and her advocacy for adoption and children, I could feel her knowledge wrapped up in this fictional story as a way to bring attention to very real issues.There\u2019s not much I can say about the plot without spoiling things, but the pacing was a bit up and down. Obviously the beginning with the text messages and the big conclusion were compulsive to read, and the middle was fairly steady, but may be a bit slow to the reader who is used to a high octane thriller as their go to read. I could just as easily see this book enjoyed on a beach vacation as I could picture someone curled up under the covers in a mountain cabin by a warm fire reading it. The story was neither full on fluff or total heavy darkness; it had a nice balance to appeal to a wide array of readers and would highly recommend to the fans of dramas surrounding family secrets.

I was immediately drawn into the story from the first pages. It is beautifully written and captivating, I was engaged by the mysterious texts from the start!I could imagine myself getting a text from my sister, \"I have something for you\" and immediate panic strikes! This is possibly not good! The story and characters are multi-layered and ultimately reveal their inner motivations that drive them to make decisions they will later question. I really enjoyed the different point of views as it gave me their perspective. The family is successful and lives in a small, quiet suburban neighborhood near a lake, but beyond the the outward appearance, secrets and past mistakes will threaten to change their lives forever. This story explores how one family members decision can snowball and entangle the entire family. Just how far would you go for a precious member of your family? Do you pull together or fall apart?I would highly recommend to fans of family based mysteries that reveal hidden secrets and motives that may have you asking yourself- What would I have done?Traveling sister read with Brenda, Diane, Susanne, Jan, and Lindsay.

This was a story about a mother\u2019s love and sacrifice for her child and a family coming together after years of separation. At times, the book had my heart pounding, my worry intensifying, my stomach churning and my hope growing. There were some wild twists and turns that caught me completely off guard. I liked the main characters Quinn and Everlee. The remaining characters I had more of a hard time connecting with. Some ended up growing on me, while others began to irritate me and a few relationships felt awkward and forced. I also found some situations questionable from a realistic perspective, but I was still able to endure and enjoy the story unfolding. This book started off stronger than it ended. The beginning captured my attention and had me drawn into the storyline and characters. The last third of the book lost its spark for me as there was so much aimless going back and forth chasing after characters. Overall, I\u2019m happy I read the book and enjoyed the story, but it wasn\u2019t a standout novel for me.

The title of this book is spot-on for a family that has grown apart for various and sundry reasons. A mysterious text from one sister to another will set things in motion for a reunion that may prove to hold some answers and possibly repair damage done. This was a little on the tepid side for me.

We were mostly split into two different ones, some sisters were lost in the lush coulee and enjoying this one and others were lost in the dry coulee and finding themselves bored and napping leaving them uninterested in this one.Little Broken Things starts off suspenseful and caught the attention of some sisters and then slows down quite a bit in the middle leaving us a bit disappointed and then picks up near the end and wrapped up quite nicely for the sisters in the lush coulee. We would have liked it to have been a bit better paced.Nicole Baart delivers a quieter suspenseful mystery novel with some family drama that is free from using any shock value to surprise her readers, making this one a nice safe read. There is a little dark to the story to add to the dynamics of the family, however, there are no surprises here. The sisters in the dry coulee found that to be predictable and were bored with the storyline. The story is a refreshing yet a little dark that explores the complicated relationships between flawed women and what ties a family together. The story revolves around a little girl Lucy who captured our hearts and we enjoyed the relationships she had with the women in this story. Norma and I recommend this one to readers who are looking for a safer, suspenseful story with some family drama with no real surprises to shock you.

No explanations, no timeline\u2014just a\u00a0plea to keep\u00a0the girl safe and hidden for a few days.\u00a0Nora flees before Quinn has\u00a0the chance to refuse. What has Nora dragged\u00a0Quinn into?\nSometimes the surface is not an accurate indicator of what lies beneath.\u00a0\nThe Sanfords appeared to be a typical suburban family to the outside world, but there were deep fractures forming behind closed doors. The chapters alternate between the perspectives of the three Sanford women:\u2022 Quinn and Nora's mother Liz is a problem-solver, though she's never\u00a0been comfortable examining any problem too deeply:\u00a0\"sometimes getting lost in the details was better than stepping back to look at the whole, ugly picture.\"\u00a0Anytime her thoughts get too close to the heart of an issue, she immediately shifts her attention elsewhere. Over the years, she made many compromises\u00a0trying to keep her family together and maintain their perfect facade.\u00a0It cost her; time\u00a0flew by and everything she was trying to preserve disintegrated. She centered her identity\u00a0around being a wife and a mother, but now her husband is dead and her children want little to do with her. After years of taking a back seat in her own life, she's finally in\u00a0charge. She's determined to fix her family's problems, even if things have to get a little messy first.\nLiz was no idiot. She knew that their lives were far from perfect, that things simmered just beneath the surface of their shiny facade. Shadowy things that hinted of discontent, of darkness that she could only begin to imagine. Weren\u2019t they all just a knife blade away from madness? From obsession? From giving in to every lust and desire and impulse? Or even just one. One slip would be more than enough.\nBut life was hard and self-flagellation was for the weak. People pitied those who refused to help themselves. Who couldn't make a mistake and then, proudly, stand back up in the middle of their own mess and smile. I meant to do that. I knew all along.\nLiz chose dignity.\n\u2022 Nora\u00a0(27) is the middle child. She's rebellious and passionate.\u00a0She escaped her family as soon as she could.\u2022 Quinn\u00a0(26) is an eternal optimist and eager to be loved. She idolizes her older sister Nora who is kind of a mythic figure to her.\u00a0Quinn craves stability and will do anything to keep the peace.\u00a0It surprised everyone when she ran off to Los Angeles and married an artist. Now both Quinn and her husband Walker are unemployed and temporarily living\u00a0at her mother's rental property in Key Lake, Minnesota. Not only do they have financial stress, but Liz\u00a0has made no secret of her disapproval for Walker.\n[Liz] was a good peacekeeper. Shush now, be content, let it go. Peacemaking\u2014now that was a different thing altogether. That was bombs and battles, wars waged for the sake of starting over, from the scorched earth up, on something pure and worthy. Peacemaking meant casualties, and Liz was all too willing to fall on a sword of silence if it meant life could go on the way it always had.\n\nDISLIKES\n\u2022 This book is recommended for fans of Liane Moriarty. Both Baart and Moriarty have a talent for examining complex emotions and uncomfortable thoughts, but what I like most about Moriarty's writing are the moments of lightness and her wicked sense of humor.\u00a0Little Broken Things didn't make me feel the same range of emotions, though I liked the rare moments of joy that appeared.\u2022 Nora's character was elusive\u00a0to me. I never\u00a0fully understood Nora's complete devotion and self-sacrifice for her best friend. The one thing that would have made sense to me didn't pan out. It was interesting that all the Sanford women\u00a0experienced uneven relationships, or at very least felt on unequal footing with their partner.\u2022 I liked when Liz reflected on her marriage and her alienation from her children, but overall she was so unlikable and\u00a0self-serving that I kept\u00a0looking to see how many minutes were left in her chapters. I was not interested in her party planning, even though her focus on the superficial made sense! To be completely fair, I think\u00a0my recent reading of Celeste Ng's Little Fires Everywhere reduced my tolerance for this type of character (and for meaningful art projects at the end). One small thing\u00a0that endeared me to Liz was her\u00a0reflexive impulse to make passive aggressive comments\u00a0or\u00a0offer unsolicited advice and the immediate regret she felt as she was doing it!\u00a0Nora and Quinn both have positive manifestations of Liz's\u00a0most annoying qualities, so\u00a0it would've been interesting to get more of a glimpse of pre-marriage Liz.\u2022 The characters had a tendency jump to conclusions and repeatedly assert those conclusions as fact. This is especially annoying\u00a0when it happens so early in the story that you can assume they're probably misguided!\u2022 \u201cI think I have a God complex.\u201d\u00a0 These characters had a frustrating habit of trying to handle\u00a0HUGE problems on their own. I often wished they would consult the police, a lawyer, or even each other and let me get on with my life. :D\u2022 Predictable. I figured out all the twists as the characters were introduced, so the reveals\u00a0were underwhelming.\nKids grow out of the sweet mommy stage so quickly, morphing overnight into titles that sound more adult. Don\u2019t be fooled\u2014it\u2019s a sort of letting go, that moment when the near-perfect queen of the universe becomes a little more human, a little less divine.\u00a0\n\nLIKES\n:\u2022 I enjoyed\u00a0Baart's writing and insights. I wanted to see how the story played out.\u2022 Quinn! I\u00a0related to her the most and I really liked her character arc from beginning to end. I especially enjoyed reading her conflicted feelings about marriage, motherhood, and her sister. One of my favorites scenes was when she becomes overwhelmed during a\u00a0gathering of old high school friends. She no longer fits into the small town life that she once reveled in. She has difficulty being surrounded by all the young families while she is trying to get pregnant.\nQuinn was not a woman who knew. Who had crossed the divide and bore the scars to prove it. She both loved and loathed herself for it.\n\u2022\u00a0The BEST part was Quinn trying to win over six-year-old Everlee\u2014all the painful rejections and the small victories. If you read the \"Acknowledgements\" section at the end, you'll understand why those scenes were so special!\u00a0 While Quinn is trying to bond with Everlee, Liz is\u00a0trying\u00a0to reconnect with Quinn and failing. She wants so badly to\u00a0have a relationship with her daughter, but she can't overcome her own flaws to make any progress.\nThey were too far apart and far too close all at the same time. Perpetually missing each other.\nWho is Everlee? What is Nora running from?\u00a0What tore the Sanford family apart\u2014was it one big explosion or the build-up of multiple tiny fractures? Will this broken family\u00a0be able to put themselves back together again? Will\u00a0the Sanford women learn that it's okay to be vulnerable? I preferred the small family conflicts over the big central drama. This book is at it's best when dealing with conflicted family relationships. The characters can't help feel the inescapable pull towards their family (biological or chosen) even after they've been hurt numerous times: \"How could she begin to explain the way she felt for her husband? The pretty layers that peeled back to reveal something dark and rotting beneath? They had lived a good, solid, respectable life. But that didn\u2019t mean that she loved him. That she would mourn his loss. And yet.\"\u00a0I've overdone it on the suburbia/\"behind closed doors\"\u00a0type books lately, so that might have affected my enjoyment. Fans of domestic dramas like\u00a0Cruel Beautiful World\u00a0by Caroline Leavitt and\u00a0The Fall of Lisa Bellow\u00a0by Susan Perabo\u00a0might enjoy this story.____________I received this book for free from Netgalley and Atria Books.

Nora then disappears without explanation. Secrets tend to be revealed sooner or later, and this one is no exception. Just how does one hide a little girl? There are mysteries to be solved: who are her parents? Why is she being hidden and why must it be kept a secret? Where has Nora been all these years? The story is gradually revealed through each character's point of view in alternating chapters. More secrets are revealed, secrets that have caused damage in the family.It's a great set-up that failed to completely deliver. The pacing was uneven and often failed to keep my attention. I found some character arcs predictable and I simply didn't buy into some of their actions. Donovan was a caricature of a \"bad guy\", and Nora's actions and dedication to Tiffany all the years she was gone simply made no sense to me. Not only did they make no sense, they obviously traumatized Lucy, which made Nora a very unsympathetic character.The so-called twist at the end was anti-climactic. It was so obvious from the very beginning and my only emotion was puzzlement that it was such a surprise to the characters.However, although this ended up being a just OK read for me, all wasn't lost. My favorite character ended up being Liz. I think the author did an excellent job with her character development. I liked how not every story thread was tied up in a neat bow at the end, and the novel ended on a hopeful note, even if some of the scenes leading up to it were implausible. In an attempt to draw on the popularity of Big Little Lies, the blurb compares this book to Liane Moriarty's best seller. The only similarity I found was one: there are secrets. I wish publisher's would stop comparing books, as it does both the author and the reader a disservice. I read this with the Traveling Sisters, Brenda, Norma, Diane, Holly, Susanne and Lindsay, and, as always, it was enjoyable to talk about the book and our differing opinions.(edited to add link) The Traveling Sister review, and others, can be found on their blog here: https://twogirlslostinacouleereading....* many thanks to Netgalley and Atria books for a copy of the book for review"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14045562-amy", "userReview": "4.5/5Have you seen the buzz surrounding this gem of a book?

After all, it\u2019s not every day that a sister alters the appearance of a child, assigns her a new name, and drops her off at her semi-estranged sister\u2019s house with no explanation. But that\u2019s exactly what Nora has done to Quinn. It\u2019s up to Quinn determine who this young girl is and, more importantly, why Nora has gone to such lengths to disguise her and hide her away. It\u2019s easy to be captivated by a novel that begins with a child in real or potential danger. The pacing slowed a bit after the first twenty-five per cent or so but remained steady and enjoyable.The story was told from the several points of view which worked well. The author\u2019s style of writing was a bit more straightforward than is my preference and there were a few times that I felt it was a bit cliche, but overall it was solid.As for the characters, they were a mixed bag. I really didn\u2019t care for Liz, the mother of the girls. She was a bit stereotyped and whiney throughout most of the book. I did appreciate that toward the end of the book, she seemed to have developed a backbone and a sense of purpose. I thought Quinn was sweet but not as strong as I would have liked. Nora\u2019s character was well-written, though. She frustrated the heck out of me with all of her cryptic messages and lack of communication in a good way. There is another integral character (who I\u2019ll not name here) whose point of view makes appearances less than a handful of times. I LOVED that character\u2019s point of view and voice and feel that Nicole Bart\u2019s talent as a writer shined most in those brief paragraphs. I would have been very happy to hear more from her.There was some predicability within the story but I thought the plot was very original. I could have done without some of the romantic stuff but that is just personal preference. As you may know, I\u2019m all about the thrill and mystery. Love just makes me roll my eyes.

Thanks to the author for giving me a chance to read an early copy to read and enjoy early. I have read other books by Nicole Baart but in Little Broken Things, she is absolutely at the top of her game - it's a wonderful story about family and love and the secrets that we keep to protect our family, even when those secrets cause more harm than intended.This novel is told by three women Quinn, who lives near her mother, with her artist-husband Walker; Nora, the oldest daughter and the wild child who ran away right after high school and the mom Liz, who has spent her entire life trying to be the perfect wife and perfect mother and made herself into a person that her daughters are unable to trust or connect with. Add to these three women, a small girl, Lucy, who Nora leaves with Quinn for protection but protection from what or who? Quinn doesn't know and her mother isn't supposed to find out about Lucy. Overall, this is the story of love in families and how far family members will go to protect those that they love. It's suspenseful and kept me turning the pages long into the night to find out the true story behind Lucy and her involvement with other family members.This is a must read book for readers who enjoy well written family drama and suspense. I highly, highly recommend it!I received an advance review copy of this book from the Great Thought's Ninja Review Team.

LITTLE BROKEN THINGS is a thriller based around a shattered family that is filled with secrets. At the heart of the family is estranged sisters and a little girl who is with one sister and left in the care of another. Who is Lucy? Is that her real name? And what is she being hidden from?I loved this story. It was layered and intense. Every page held a different mystery and the unraveling makes my heart break. I loved all the characters and Ms Baart's strong use of imagery through her setting and beautiful language allowed me to picture everything. For the first time in a long time I didn't figure out the twist. Even the title has me guessing. Who is broken? Or is it what was broken? And what fractures can be healed?Outstanding. I loved this novel and can't wait for it to be released on 11/21/17 so I can share it with others I've read all of Nicole Baart's stand alones and her trilogy.

Such a mixture of joy and sadness, hope and doubt. This book is mesmerizing and suspenseful; my heart was in my throat while reading, compelling me to keep turning pages. At the heart of this story is a family; a family which has been torn apart and scattered for a myriad of reasons; when a forlorn little girl comes into their lives, surrounded by mystery, they know they must keep her safe and help her heal. But by protecting her, will their family grow further apart, or will they, despite the pain of the past, become whole again? The characters in this book are as broken and as beautiful as a piece of sea glass; their relationships with each other, the love and sometimes the frustration that they feel for each other are poignant and real. This beautiful book reminds us that there is beauty to be found even in things that were broken; that our lives are filled with dark and light, love and loss, faith and despair. These characters and the journey they take will live on in my heart always."}, {"userName": "Reading.Between.Wines", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-reading-between-wines", "userReview": "\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\udcab / 5 - rounded up to 4 for Goodreads.My reviews and (maybe) some other random thoughts can also be seen at https://readingbetweenwinessite.wordp... ____________________________________________________________This was my very first novel by Baart, and once again, I have very mixed feelings (go figure). I should mention that I basically read this in 2 sittings, and I stayed up until 2 AM to finish it because I couldn't put it down. That's part of the reason why I couldn't give it less than a 3.5 star rating. At first it wasn't really holding my attention, but after I hit around page 100 I got sucked in and couldn't stop. Family drama, secrets, lies, and a whooooole lot more is what you will find in Little Broken Things. The story basically takes place over a series of 4 days and at the end there is an \"After\" which is essentially the epilogue. There is so much going on in that 4 days that it felt like it should have taken place over at least 30 days. I loved that this book is set in a (albeit fictional) town in Minnesota named Key Lake. I am from MN and just recently moved away, so it added a little something for me to have this book set in my home sate. Even though most of the places talked about are fictitious, which I was a little bummed out about, it was still fun seeing New Ulm and Rochester mentioned. I'm always the one that is like \"I've been there!!\" when I see some place I am familiar with in a book. It is always an enjoyable feeling. Told in alternating viewpoints, the story mainly focuses on sisters Quinn and Nora, and their mom Liz. I am a huge fan of alternating viewpoints so it was nice to have that in this book. As far as characters go, I kind of struggled with liking many of them. Everlee of course was adorable, and I felt so bad for that little girl. At first I really didn't find Liz to be particularly likable, but then she actually ended up being my favorite character in the book. Her development was definitely the best of any character in the book in my opinion. My biggest caveat with this book was the fact that the characters were SO shocked by the ending. I feel like you have to be pretty dumb to not understand what was going on. They all acted so confused and surprised, and that just felt really unbelievable to me. I even figured out what was going on, and that is rare. Random Observation: The phrase \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" was repeated quite a bit in this book and seeing it repeated so many times started to irritate me. I'm probably being irrational, but I just noticed that and it started to bug me for whatever reason.Final Thought: A lot of people really loved this book, and I totally appreciate the time and effort it must have taken Baart to write this. It wasn't my favorite, but I'm sure a ton of people will like it. If you like family drama with some hidden secrets you should give it a shot. It was suspenseful and the story moved at a decent pace, but I wouldn't say it was super twisty or anything. I definitely want to read more from Nicole Baart though. Besides the fact that she seems like an amazing, generous person, there was nothing wrong with the writing of this book, it just wasn't completely for me. Hopefully I can have some better luck with other novels from her! Also, trigger warning for rape and child molestation. It was mostly eluded to and wasn't described in depth, but wanted to throw that out there. *The paperback was first published on 21 Nov 2017*"}, {"userName": "Sonja Yoerg", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6978062-sonja-yoerg", "userReview": "Estranged families make for rich stories; no matter how much we might yearn to be free of our relatives, an undeniable attachment remains. Little Broken Things is a tension-filled story in which family secrets, mistrust, and allegiances threatening to swallow up the loyalty and love that has somehow survived. Baart is a thoughtful, sensitive writer who creates a realistic and complex dilemma surrounding a child in jeopardy. At several points in the novel, it would've been easy to veer into melodrama or reach for a trite resolution, but Baart is too seasoned and too honest for that. Instead, she delivers an intriguing mystery wrapped up inside a family's journey through loss, forgiveness and hope. We are all of us little broken things and rely on stories such as this one to show us something about how to mend ourselves."}, {"userName": "Ronak Gajjar", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70806774-ronak-gajjar", "userReview": "I was compelled by this appealing mystery, read it out of literal cover-lust.

My first book by this author, and it was enjoyable enough, but it was no Big Little Lies, a book which sticks with me more than a year after reading it. BLL grabbed me, impressed me, made me laugh, cry, care...the book much more than the excellent series. The book made the men more fully realized characters than the series, and that made all the relationships deeper and more compelling. It was a book that spoke to me and my husband, as friends, lovers, parents, partners. It transcended its chick-lit marketing. This book does not, and that\u2019s ok. But the publishers are setting it up for disappointed readers when it fails to meet expectations as the next BLL. This book has a decent story, but it did not grab and hold my interest as I wished it would have. The men were stereotypes, the women somewhat less so but no one made me identify with them or care enough...I did not feel like this was the book I really wanted to be reading and started others while reading it. Also, I was not surprised by anything in the plot, it all played out as if I had the outline in front of me. And I just talked myself into removing a star. So, 3.5-ish rounded down. It\u2019s an ok read, it just needs more heart. The author\u2019s explanation of its origins made me feel more in a few sentences than the book did.

When Quinn Cruz receives that cryptic text message from her older sister Nora, she doesn\u2019t think much of it. They haven\u2019t seen each other in nearly a year and thanks to Nora\u2019s fierce aloofness, their relationship consists mostly of infrequent phone calls and an occasional email or text. But when a haunted Nora shows up at the lake near Quinn's house just hours later, a chain reaction is set into motion that will change both of their lives forever. Nora\u2019s \u201csomething\u201d is more shocking than Quinn could have ever imagined: a little girl, cowering, wide-eyed, and tight-lipped. Nora hands her over to Quinn with instructions to keep her safe, and not to utter a word about the child to anyone, especially not their buttoned-up mother who seems determined to pretend everything is perfect. But before Quinn can ask even one of the million questions swirling around her head, Nora disappears, and Quinn finds herself the unlikely caretaker of a girl introduced simply as Lucy. While Quinn struggles to honor her sister\u2019s desperate request and care for the lost, scared Lucy, she fears that Nora may have gotten involved in something way over her head\u2014something that will threaten them all.
