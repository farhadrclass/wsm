Whether it\u2019s true or not hardly seems to matter; I was still disappointed.Spencer hopes to introduce casual readers to the words of the Koran, and he has nothing good to say about it. He compares it to Mein Kampf. Here are some of the chapter titles:The Muslims\u2019 Worst Enemies: The Koran on the JewsThe Koran on Christians: They\u2019re Not So Hot, EitherThe Koran on Women: Crooked and InferiorThe Koran Teaches Nonviolence\u2014Oh, and Violence, TooHere\u2019s the bottom line: If you want to know what\u2019s in the Holy Book of Islam, read Spencer. If you want to know what Muslims believe, read Karen Armstrong. Islam is a religion of peace, which\u2014like Christianity\u2014attracts a few extremists. Like Christianity, its holy texts are in places downright abominable. Like Christians, practicing believers generally learn to ignore or spiritualize the ungodly portions of their scriptures.Spencer says about his work, \u201cYou will find nothing in this book about Islamic ritual practices or prayers. This is an Infidel\u2019s guide, focusing on where the Koran came from and its specific portions that are\u2014or should be\u2014of concern to Infidels.\u201d It is, by Spencer\u2019s admission, one-sided, and not reflective of general Muslim practices.Tomorrow, I\u2019ll balance this with a discussion of the Texts of Terror within the Bible, so we can realize how much Christians ignore in their holy book. It might help put things in perspective."}, {"userName": "Stefani", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5708293-stefani", "userReview": "Pretty much the introduction of this book says it all when the author says, \"This guide will inevitably be branded as anti-Islamic, as well as bigoted, hateful, and Islamaphobic.....Whether the Koran really says what this guide claims can easily be verified. And if this guide accurately reports its contents that couldn't possibly be an act of hatred or bigotry.\" That is the statement of the century. It is very easy to determine if this author is telling the truth, and having read the English translation of the Koran I can tell you that he is. The author presents this guide as a way to compare and contrast what most of the Judeo-Christian world would understand to what Islam understands. The two are very different and trying to understand Islam through the lens of Judaism or Christianity simply cannot work.He tells both the good and the bad, which I found to be vitally important. If there is a sura, or verse, that promotes peace or tolerance he will list it. But often times you'll find that there is a subtext there. For example, a sura might state that tolerance should be given to \"true believers\". Well according to the Koran the only true believers are Muslims, so everyone else is exempt from this tolerance. But undoubtedly there are a lot of verses that to the average Christian or Jew will seem to be promoting peace and equality based on how they view the words. But the way the Muslim world may view those words is entirely different. I found this book informative and an important read for anyone non-Muslim. Because like it or not, according to the Koran you are an infidel who does not hold the same rights and respects as a Muslim. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of wonderful, peaceful Muslims out there. But by reading the Koran it is not hard to understand where the extremist ones come up with their views. Knowledge is power and that is what this book provides, fair and honest knowledge. And if you still believe him to be a hateful bigot, read the Koran for yourself and you will find all of the verses listed in black and white."}, {"userName": "Jc", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc", "userReview": "Together with Ibn Warraq's \"Why I Am Not a Muslim,\" this is a must read for non-Muslims who wish to understand the background, history, and possible results of the violent forms of Islam that are claiming power today.

An interesting book. A biased book. A necessary book.The author, Robert Spencer, makes no bones about the fact that he has an agenda: He wants to show people the TRUTH about Islam. Did he succeed? Well, yes and no.Yes: I know much more about Islam than I did going in which was sadly very little. However, I'm exactly the intended audience for this book, i.e. someone who is interested in why so many people keep referencing the Koran as their motivation for killing.No: The author succeeded in showing what passages radical Muslims use to justify their killings. He also showed other passages that advocate peace but claims that all of these have been \"abrogated.\" A similar issue also comes up in the Bible but in reverse. See, in the Koran, the touchy-feely passages are up front and the super scary passages tend to come later. There are different schools of thought as to which verses abrogate, the former or the latter. In the Bible, it's the opposite. The hard core fire and brimstone is in the Old Testament and the \"Jesus-Happy-Good-Funtime\" comes later. I definitely understand people saying that what comes later trumps what comes before, but I feel that that particular issue is a personal faith decision. I guess what I'm saying is that, much like the Bible, you can find justification for your actions in the Koran, whatever they are, it just depends on where you look.HOWEVER, the Koran is a very different document from the Bible. The Koran talks about violence and war and killing infidels A LOT. I had always assumed that these might be a few isolated passages, but not so much. Again, I don't think the vast majority of practicing Muslims see the violent passages as a) relevant to in their modern lives and/or b) abrogated by the passages that promote peace.I did get a kick out of some of the \"peace\" passages though. So many times it would say stuff like \"Be tolerant of Christians and Jews...as long as they convert to Islam...or are subservient to Islam...or do Islam's laundry, etc.\"I was also surprised by how much the Koran name drops Jesus, Moses, Abraham, et al. Who these individuals are in the Koran is very different from who they are in the Bible. I hadn't really realized that when Muslims/Christians/Jews are talking about these guys that we're not REALLY talking about the same guys, at least in terms of a narrative that we can all agree on.If the Koran reminded me of anything it seemed to be closest to the Book of Mormon for a couple of different reasons:1. As I said before, all of the appropriating of other religions figures to strengthen their argument. \"Oh yeah guys, Jesus existed but he was a Muslim prophet so...yeah, deal with it.\"2. Much like the Book of Mormon, it had that \"making-it-up-as-I-go-along\" feel. For example, the Koran says men can't have more than 3 wives, but Allah told Muhammed that he could have more. How nice of Allah! That's always the easiest way to make me suspicious of your holy book: having God tell you what the rules are and then saying that you are the only exception. It would have been like if Moses had come down the mountain with 11 Commandments and one of them was \"Tuesday is 'Moses Gets a Back Rub\" day.\"I was hoping this book would be my one stop shop to figure out Islam but alas, Spencer is WAY too biased. I understand his concerns, I mean this is life and death we're talking about here. I like his passion but he's too close to the issue and I don't think he gives religious moderates enough credit.The book succeeded in showing me what passages the religious extremists use to justify their actions and what passages peaceful Muslims use to justify their actions. For that, it's a good read. But I know I need to find something more balanced lest I come away with too bleak a picture of an entire religion."}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6721230-paula", "userReview": "While not a complete compendium of Islam, for anyone who is interested in how the current conflict came about and how a group with the same God as Jews and Christians could want to kill you because.. well, God said so..(huuruph?)this is a great place to start.I think any modern English speaking person is aware that most people do not follow their religion to the letter, bacon egg and cheeses and Saturday traffic at the mall -2 general examples-but to pretend that there isn't a significant faction in the world who does follow the letter of this specific law- who has declared war on us as a result - and fired some pretty impressive opening salvos- is preposterous. This is a book that helps us understand why, in contrast to partial quotes we hear in the news- the actual text gives us more insight into the source of the intense hatred we face from zealous believers. The author does a great job of finishing the partial ideas we find in political rhetoric that seems mutually exclusive of the actions of jihadists. He does a great job of describing how the Koran is written, the hierarchy of the religion, which texts are relevant and how they came about- and what passages are relevant to non believers who find ourselves embroiled in this conflict and think... why?I can understand why some people might think it anti-Muslim- because we're a bunch of PC sissy maries. It does focus on the parts of the Koran most relevant to the non-believer- IE the parts where fanatical believers get their justification and instruction to murder the rest of us, to value our lives less, effectively dehumanizing non believers. I'm sorry guys- this is relevant. I'm glad most practitioners of Islam skip these passages, and I recognize that fact, as does the author. The uproar about it being anti Muslim is silly. Then call me anti-Semitic because I say, accurately, Halakhah says pork chops are a no go. Its either accurate translation or not. Yes? Then what? Oh, he didn't skip the not nice parts? Everyone blames ignorance for prejudice, but we finally have an author who looks to enlighten us with respect to the role religion plays in the current conflict- not as a complete be-all-end all to how to live as a good Muslim- and he is being condemned.

I have long intended to read the Koran itself, but lose my motivation for three reasons. First, the Koran is not a collection of chronological teachings, but provides bits and pieces of Muhammed's wisdom without context. Also, Islam teaches that the Koran is to be read only in Arabic. Finally, Islam accepts the Koran as incomplete without the illumination of the Hadith, which has no canonically agreed content...some scholars accept only certain Hadith, and others add other commentary. All of these reasons motivated me instead to read a treatise on the Koran first, rather than the book itself. As a Christian, I do not accept the heavenly origin of the Koran, but I try to suspend disbelief and see the teachings through the eyes of those who first received it. It is still easier for me to believe the authenticity of Jewish and Christian Scripture, and see the Koran as a corruption of them, rather than vice-versa, given their length, completeness, dates of origin, proofs of historial veracity, and the very important fact that Jewish and Christian Scripture were written by multiple authors over a long period of time.

Rather, after much careful study Spencer found many elements of Islam that displeased and even frightened him. I believe Spencer succeeded in presenting a balanced work, in part because he included extensive translations.

I would agree with the said Westerners previously; although, after reading the book, I have big reservations about it. In short, the author is very convincing and rational in his arguments, and I have nothing against them. However, I feel desperation now: it's very soothing to think about inevitable peace in the world and \"just little misunderstandings and isolated nasty accidents\" (as the said Westerners mostly do), but it's very scary to realize the insurmountable differences between Islamic and non-Islamic cultures and understand that it is impossible to achive any peaceful coexistence. At least, the book gives all grounds to think about it.The main problem of Westerners' perception of Islam and Muslim culture is that we try to think about it through the prism of our own cultural traditions and believes. We think that every religion should be peaceful and demand increasing goodness in the world, not evil. So, we think about Islam in such terms exactly. We translate our own moral on aliens, and this can be deadly for us. We read Koran and see there a lot of wise words about peace and goodness -- that's it, we think, that's it!!! Islam is a peaceful religion, and we must respect it. What about terrorism, oppression of human rights, bigotry? Ah, we say, this is \"just little misunderstandings and isolated nasty accidents\"! We also had our own problems with religions and religion-related issues, all those sectarians and isolated fanatics and so on. So we should treat Muslims with utmost respect and tolerance. Right? Right?!That's the root of all our problems with failure of multi-cultural society. Islam is an inherently agressive religion. Muslim faith does not understand and does not accept any other faithes, as well as atheism. Koran not only demands to persecute and kill all \"infidels\" (yes, yes, kill in the very sence of the word, these are words of Koran, and Muslims take them literally); it's also regards the very existence of \"infidels\" as an impediment to spread of Islam in the world -- and this is, in Koran's terms, a very strong justification for active war against all non-Muslims. This is their \"defence\" strategy.I saw a lot of articles and TED-talks where speakers tryed to discuss Koran in peaceful terms. That is: I read Koran, and it says a lot about peace; or: I know a lot of Muslims, and they are peaceful and kind people. Just recently I saw this TED-talk, for example: Lesley Hazleton | The doubt essential to faith with the following words: \"And yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority, have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority. We've allowed Judaism to be claimed by violently messianic West Bank settlers, Christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots, Islam by suicide bombers. And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be Christians, Jews or Muslims, militant extremists are none of the above. They're a cult all their own, blood brothers steeped in other people's blood.This isn't faith. It's fanaticism, and we have to stop confusing the two. We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers. It's difficult and stubborn. It involves an ongoing struggle, a continual questioning of what we think we know, a wrestling with issues and ideas. It goes hand in hand with doubt, in a never-ending conversation with it, and sometimes in conscious defiance of it.\"Yeah, yeah, yeah... Very strong message, to which all the Westerners sympathize unconditionally. This is very typical rhetoric of Westerners about Koran and Islam. The problem is that we are trying to judge about things we do not understand and do not want understand. We do not want understand the whole Islam. We want understand only the peaceful part of it. But this is not the whole Islam, oh no.All these phenomena are explicitly discussed in the Robert Spencer's book. I agree with him completely. How cannot I?\"For a lesson in the hazards of not understanding the Koran, let's look at President Obama's June 4,2009, Cairo address to the Muslim world. Filled with reverential references to the supposedly compassionate teachings of the \"holy Koran,\" the speech serves as an abject lesson in the wishful thinking, self-delusion, and political correctness that pervades Western assumptions about Islamic scripture.In praising the Koran's ostensibly peaceful teachings, Obama cited verse 5:32: \"The Holy Koran,\" said the President, \"teaches that whoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind; and whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind.\" This sounds peaceful enough, but Obama studiously ignored the next verse (5:33), which mandates punishment for those whom Muslims do not regard as \"innocent\" -- punishments including crucifixion or amputation of a hand and a foot for those who fight against Allah and Muhammad. The axiom against killing innocents, as we will see in chapter three, came from the Jewish tradition; in the Koranic passage, however, it becomes a warning of dire earthly punishment for those Jews who resist Muhammad and his religion.Obama also quoted a Koranic verse (9:119) that supposedly supports his call for inter-religious tolerance:\"As the Holy Koran tells us, \"Be conscious of God and speak always the truth.\" That is what I will try to do-to speak the truth as best I can, humbled by the task before us, and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart.\"Once again, this Koranic passage is actually about fighting unbelievers, and doesn't remotely advocate peaceful coexistence. One principal English translation, that of Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall, renders the verse this way: \"O ye who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah, and be with the truthful.\"The passage continues:\"It is not for the townsfolk of Al-Madinah and for those around them of the wandering Arabs to stay behind the messenger of Allah and prefer their lives to his life. That is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicteth them in the way of Allah, nor step they any step that angereth the disbelievers, nor gain they from the enemy a gain, but a good deed is recorded for them therefor. Lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the good. Nor spend they any spending, small or great, nor do they cross a valley, but it is recorded for them, that Allah may repay them the best of what they used to do. And the believers should not all go out to fight. Of every troop of them, a party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may gain sound knowledge in religion, and that they may warn their folk when they return to them, so that they may beware. O ye who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you, and let them find harshness in you, and know that Allah is with those who keep their duty (unto Him). (9:120-23)\"This is just an example from the prologue. The book overall is a meticulous analysis of Koran ideas and messages. I highly recommend to read it, especially if you still think that Islam is a peaceful religion, the one with which Christianity, Judaism, or atheism can coexist. With which you personally can coexist as a non-Muslim. Good luck to you then... Koran teaches violence (\"slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush,\" etc), and deception, and holy war against all unbelievers. Koran teaches \"to defence\" the religion from infidelity by killing \"infidels\" proactively -- this is Muslims view on \"defence,\" yes. Koran teaches inferiority of women, and calls Christians and Jews \"monkies\" and \"pigs.\" And Koran is not just an analogue of our Holy Bible, which you can read and thumb and cite at your own will, but live according to the official legislation of your country. Koran is still highly reverred, and it's politically and socially inacceptable to \"misunderstand\" Koran and do something inconsistent with its words.\"The book is to be treated with the deepest reverence. Muslims consider it so holy that they are not to touch a Koran unless they are in a state of ritual purity; non-Muslims, according to Islamic law, are not supposed to touch it at all except under strictly defined circumstances. And the failure to show proper respect for a Koran, anywhere in the world, can be fatal -- a false report in Newsweek magazine in 2005 that U.S. military interrogators at Guantanamo Bay had flushed a Koran down a toilet sparked rioting in Muslim countries, resulting in at least fifteen deaths.\"All this is very, very sad. But it is a necessary starting point; you should not lie to yourself..."}], "description": "\"Meticulous, comprehensive, indispensable.
