If you're easily offended, this book is not for you. It's tongue-in-cheek, it's darkly humorous, and it's absolutely fa-bu-lous *snaps finger*. It confronts the truth behind our daily lives...it deals with issues of race, sexism, and stereotypes, while managing to retain a light, sarcastic tone. The main characters in this book are all beauty pageant competitors, but rest assured, they are strong feminist types, down to the take-charge Miss Texas, who is a hell of a lot tougher than her big breasts and blonde hair would imply.\nTaylor stood in a perfect three-quarters stance, arms hanging easily at her sides. \u201cI have been class president three years in a row, homecoming queen, a National Merit Scholar, and a member of the National Honor Society, and I am a proud, card-carrying member of FAF \u2014 Femmes and Firearms. I can shoot a thirty-aught-six as well as a nine-millimeter and a Pink Lady paint gun. Last year, I took down my first buck, which I cleaned, filleted, and vacuum sealed, and with my taxidermy skills, I stuffed the head and used the antlers as a supercute jewelry tree, which I plan to market for the Armchair Shopping Network in the spring. That is American ingenuity. It\u2019s what makes this country great, and if elected, I would be proud to serve. Thank you.\u201d\nSome brilliant genius decided to hold a pageant on a far-off island, and the 50 contestants of the Miss Teen Dream pageant, along with the army needed to maintain them, are being flown there. The only problem is that the plane crashes onto a deserted island and pretty much everyone dies. The surviving contestants will have to, well, survive on a delightful tropical island using their own wits, ingenuity, and pageant-approved talents. The contestants range from the confident and strong leader, Perky Miss Texas...to Adina, who had a plan before it came crashing down along with the plane.\nAdina had entered \u2026 but for her own secret reasons. She would smile and pose, and when the time was right, she would show everyone what a joke this was \u2014 what a joke her mom\u2019s life was. How stupid the girls in her high school were for believing in this beauty and happily-ever-after crap. She would use the money from the publication of her expos\u00e9 to buy that drum kit herself. Maybe she\u2019d even write a song about the whole experience. \u201cArtificial Girl.\u201d Or \u201cTeen Dream Armageddon.\u201d Yeah. Adina liked the sound of that. She would be a beauty pageant Che Guevara7.\nThe situations within the book are absolutely outrageous and ludicrous, and the \"can-do\" attitude that is pervasive throughout the book makes it seem more insane, but I loved every single moment.\nMiss New Mexico stared, dumbfounded. \u201cStand out? Stand out! I have a freaking tray stuck in my forehead!\u201d She broke into fresh sobs.Taylor clapped for attention. \u201cMiss New Mexico, let\u2019s not get all down in the bummer basement where the creepy things live. There are people in heathen China who don\u2019t even have airline trays. We have a lot to be grateful for.\u201d\nThe girls not only have to survive, but must maintain their pageant form by constantly practicing and being in top form for the competition once they're rescued...\n\u201cOhmigosh. No food at all.\u201d Tiara sank down on the sand as if the full weight of their predicament had finally hit her. She blinked back tears. And then that megawatt smile that belonged on cereal boxes across the nation reappeared. \u201cI am going to be so superskinny by pageant time!\u201d\nBut cold, harsh reality soon sets in. They're probably fucked.\n\"I\u2019m so hungry. Even hungrier than when my mom put me on that grapefruit and hot sauce diet before the Miss Tupelo pageant last year.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve done that diet,\u201d Nicole said.Shanti nodded. \u201cMe, too. Except without the grapefruit.\u201dTiara\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cAll those years of starving myself and now I\u2019m really starving.\u201d\u201cFeels like we\u2019ve been in training for the wrong pageant,\u201d Nicole said with a sigh.Their bellies ached with hunger, and the earlier thrill of losing a few pounds before pageant time had been replaced with a terrible, desperate longing for food.\nI know that from the quotes, the book seems very lighthearted and silly, don't let that fool you, because this book deals with a lot of serious issues, albeit in a very offhanded manner. The issue of race is a particularly noticeable one, it's mentioned sometimes in a flippant manner.\nFor a second, Nicole wasn\u2019t sure that she should go with these white girls. They sounded like they\u2019d gone straight-up crazy, and the only other brown girl was giving her an eyeful of attitude. Nicole did what she\u2019d been taught since she was little and her parents had moved into an all-white neighborhood: She smiled and made herself seem as friendly and nonthreatening as possible.\nBut that little quote right there is the harsh reality of being black or minority in America. African-Americans have to blend in. They have to appear cultured. They have to be non-threatening in order to be accepted. This book also confronts the double-standards of race.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think the pageant\u2019s a little racist? I mean, in the whole history of the pageant, an African-American girl has only won once \u2014 Sherry Sparks.\u201dIn the forty-year history of the Miss Teen Dream Pageant, she was the only African-American winner \u2014 until it was revealed that Sherry had once shoplifted an eye shadow from an Easy Rx store and she was drummed out in shame. It didn\u2019t matter that in the years since then, two white contestants had been disqualified for sexy phone photos, or that last year\u2019s winner, Miss Florida, had been forced to apologize when it was discovered that she had gotten drunk at a frat party and a video surfaced of her sloppily twirling batons in her underwear and bra. No, it was still Sherry Sparks they talked about.\nThis was a hilarious, darkly humorous, witty, and altogether fantastic book."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "According to this book and the Teen Dream Beauty contestants, women and particularly girls tend to apologise immediately before or after voicing their opinion. For example: \"I'm sorry but I just think...\" or \"I really don't like such-and-such, sorry but that's just my opinion\". So in true girl power spirit I'm going to openly, honestly and without apology declare that I EFFIN' LOVED THIS BOOK! In every single possible way.This is what every teenage girl should be reading. In fact, scratch that, it's what every teenager regardless of gender should be reading. This is the novel that has compiled it all, pretty much every single young adult issue has been condensed into this 380 (give or take) page book of awesomeness. I won't go shouting about it being everybody's favourite book... I'm sure that just isn't true and the mixed reviews so far have only proved my concerns about Libba Bray's humour not suiting everyone and the strange format in which the book is written also won't appeal to every single person. But, god if it isn't important!It says everything that needs to be said. It also says what people think and don't say because they're afraid of looking bad or being laughed at or being pitied. It's not just a book about gender, feminism, slut-shaming, beauty myths, depression, family issues, homosexuality, transexuality, race, racism, disabilities and feeling inadequate. It's about all of those things combined on a desert island where a bunch of Teen Beauty contestants struggle to survive without hair straighteners, make-up and lotions.I expected this to be another 'bitch' book. What do I mean? I mean the stories where girls turn on each other and destroy one another through carefully manipulated psychological abuse. I expected a combination of Lord of the Flies and 'Mean Girls'. This is not that book. This story is the one where girls, who in other circumstances are little more than each other's competition, come together in a time of crisis and find that just by sticking together and opening up to one another they come to understand more about themselves and how they are far more important than the labels they wear.This is the message I've always wanted to see and I understand why some people don't think this is the reality. I've read some reviews where it seems to be the opinion that girls in these circumstances would turn on each other in true high school bitchy fashion. I disagree. Yeah, I'm going to say that (and I'm not going to say sorry either, lol). I think that, in fact, I know from experience that people act differently when in a crisis. Priorities change and you see whole new sides of people's personalities. That is what happens here. When the girls' world is turned upside down, they do what they must to survive and, through doing so, realise a great deal of important stuff too. What I love most is that while Libba Bray's message about beauty being of no real importance is obvious, she also works to show the reader how that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with a girl wanting to look nice. This is an expression of sexuality and the novel's all for that. Can a girl who wears make-up be a feminist? Of course, ridiculous question!This is a book about survival, femininity and (kinda cheesy but I love it) being yourself. I thought it was wonderful and all the time managed to stay on the right side of that fine line between feminism and misandry. If you learn nothing else from this book, at least take away the fact that every opinion is just as important and you should never apologise for your own... on that note, I am completely, shamelessly and unapologetically in love with this book."}, {"userName": "Hailey (HaileyinBookland)", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21937982-hailey-haileyinbookland", "userReview": "4.5*Reread for class 2017*STILL SO AMAZINGLY HILARIOUS \u201cI love you for who you are, not who the world thinks you should be.\u201d This book is definitely one that you're either going to love or you're going to hate. I can see why people wouldn't like it but fortunately for me, I really really enjoyed this!! It wasn't what I expected but that was definitely a good thing! PS. I listened to this on audiobook and I definitely recommend you do the same. The audiobook is narrated by Libba Bray herself and it is just fabulous. It really makes this book 'read' as if it were a TV show.\nWriting Style\nSo I've only read one other Libba Bray book (The Diviners) which is a paranormal historical fiction. I loved it, especially the writing of it. This book, being a satirical kind of survival story is obviously of a completely different breed. Since it was so different, I wasn't sure how Libba Bray's lyrical, eloquent writing style would translate into such a genre. I was definitely pleasantly surprised. I don't know how she did it, but she was able to use her lyrical style to her advantage and completely transform the satirical form. This story was crazy funny, it read like a TV show, but it still had that fluid aspect to it that really makes Libba Bray's writing so enjoyable.\nCharacters\nI'm not going to go through each of the individual characters since there are so many but let me just say I loved every single one of the girls in this book. You would think with so many characters it would get confusing and difficult to distinguish between them but this was not an issue at all. Even with the audiobook, I could distinguish between each of the characters voices since they were so unique. For me, this says a lot about Libba Bray's abilities as a writer. Weaving so many distinct voices into one book really is such a difficult feat and the fact that she was able to do so really makes me appreciate her as a author.This is kind of overlapping with plot, but I loved the fact that each character had their own issue and they all worked together to help each other overcome their issues.\nPlot\nI simultaneously loved and hated the plot. I didn't really like how the whole Confederation plot played out though I did really enjoy the execution of it with all the little footnote advertisements and the commercials woven in. I just felt like the whole thing was a tad too far fetched for me but for the most part I did enjoy it. Like I mentioned briefly before, a lot of serious issues were brought into the plot of the story. They were so intricately woven in that you were really just unconsciously being taught so many important lessons and I loved that. The amount of issues Libba Bray was able to touch upon was amazing and I really applaud her ability to present these important, taboo issues in a funny, but not offensive manner. Overall, I loved this book. It was just so quotable and funny yet it also dealt with so many important issues and for that reason I would recommend this book to everyone, especially girls. This book made Libba Bray become one of my favourite authors."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "[because my reading of the movie is less like \"this is what happens when you overwork yourself into exhaustion in your quest to be the best, and the bad dark impulses get in\" and more like \"this is what happens when you are told that in order to be acceptable, you have to go against all your natural inclinations and you end up a triumphant bloody corpse because grrrrl power and abdominal bleeds make you succeed, but to subsume your own personality is, ultimately, death.

It\u2019s all about helping girls ID the objectification of women when they see it. You know, like when girls are asked to parade around in bathing suits and heels and get scored on that.\u201d\u2022 Jennifer Huberman's fun fact:\u201cMy personal motto is: WWWWD?: What Would Wonder Woman Do?\u201d\u2022 Petra West's fun fact:\u201cThe thing that scares me most is not being myself.\u201d \u2022 Sosie Simmons' fun fact:\u201cI am hearing impaired but that doesn\u2019t stop me! I hear with my heart. Well, not really. Because, as anybody who is not a complete and total moron knows, the heart does not have ears. This is the kind of s**t they make disabled people say all the time so everybody\u2019s all \u201cokay\u201d with us. Soooo annoying.\u201d\u2022 Mary Lou Novak's fun fact:\u201cThe most important quality in a friend is to be yourself. Unless you\u2019re not a very nice person. Then you should try to be somebody else.\u201d\u2022 Taylor Rene Krystal Hawkins's fun fact:\u201cPersonal motto: \u201cGod made me beautiful. The least I can do is share it with the world.\u201dAnd speaking of favorites of mine, I found Petra to be one of the most compelling characters within this storyline. I completely fell in love with her when we were told the tale her mother used to tell her as a bedtime story.The story was about a frog cheerfully insisting to all in the meadow that it was a princess-in-waiting.\u201cBefore sleep each night, the frog prayed to the four winds, to the great fish, to the sun above, and to the goddess moon that when it woke, it would be a princess. Yet each morning, the frog opened its eyes to find it was still only a frog. How could nature be so wrong about something so important?\u201d\u201cThe Wise Witch was very grateful to the little frog. She kept her promise. \u201cWhat is your heart\u2019s desire?\u201d she asked.But the frog had almost given up on its wish. It didn\u2019t know if such a wish were possible. \u201cWell,\u201d it said softly, afraid, \u201cI have always wanted to be a princess. But I have seen myself in the river. And it has shown me that I am a frog.\u201dThe witch smiled. \u201cThe river does not know everything. Look again.\u201dIt's one of the most beautiful stories that I've read.Also, the parts where the girls just talked with one another about what they missed and didn\u2019t miss, crumbled my heart.\u201cMiss Montana stared into the fire. \u201cSometimes I just want to go in a room and break things and scream. Like, it\u2019s so much pressure all the time and if you get upset or angry, people say, \u2018Are you on the rag or something?\u2019 And it\u2019s like I want to say, \u2018No. I\u2019m just pissed off right now. Can\u2019t I just be pissed off? How come that\u2019s not okay for me?\u2019 Like my dad will say, \u2018I can\u2019t talk to you when you\u2019re hysterical.\u2019 And I\u2019m totally not being hysterical! I\u2019m just mad. And he\u2019s the one losing it. But then I feel embarrassed anyway. So I slap on that smile and pretend everything\u2019s okay even though it\u2019s not. Anyway.\u201d Miss Montana pasted on an embarrassed half smile. \u201cSorry for the rant.\u201d\u201cWhy do you have to be sorry?\u201d Nicole asked.\u201cWell \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhy do girls always feel like they have to apologize for giving an opinion or taking up space in the world? Have you ever noticed that?\u201d Nicole asked. \u201cYou go on websites and some girl leaves a post and if it\u2019s longer than three sentences or she\u2019s expressing her thoughts about some topic, she usually ends with, \u2018Sorry for the rant\u2019 or \u2018That may be dumb, but that\u2019s what I think.\u2019\u201dThis book educated me a lot without ever feeling preachy, which I really admire.And while respectively handling serious subjects, Beauty Queens also has a wicked sense of humor that was right up my alley.\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Miss Arkansas volunteered.\u201cNo. This is about Miss New Hampshire. We are the Miss Teen Dream team. We are only as strong as our weakest link. There is no I in \u201cteam.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no U in asshole, either, and yet \u2026\u201d Adina muttered.\u201dAdina wasn't my absolute favorite because her humor could be a little overstepping. And like Petra said, just because you\u2019re funny doesn\u2019t mean you get to be cruel. But sometimes Adina uttered some of the funniest things that had me laughing out loud.Weeks go by, when suddenly the girls rescue (?) the cast of Captains Bodacious IV that arrive during a storm, which I thought would make the story lose its steam a little. But never doubt Libba Bray, because she managed to keep me entertained till the end.\u201cSay, could one of you lovelies get me something to quench my thirst?\u201dFour girls turned to go and Adina said, \u201cYou seem able-bodied to me.\u201dCaptain Sinjin put a hand to his chest. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a shipwreck, luv. We\u2019re exhausted and need to lie about.\u201d\u201cOh, I know how you feel,\u201d Tiara said. \u201cWhen our plane crashed here, and we had to bury the dead and deal with really bad wounds and Miss New Mexico got that tray stuck in her head \u2014\u201d\u201cHi!\u201d Miss New Mexico waved.\u201c\u2014 and the chaperones were all charred in the wreckage and it was really gross and scary and there was nothing to eat and no shelter and we had to build all that stuff and deal with giant snakes and bug bites and we barely survived a giant wave and mudslides and hallucinogenic plants and stuff, we were so, so tired.\u201dBut I did low-key despise the cast of pirates (at first). We were having so much fun getting to know each girl and hearing their stories, and then these reality TV boys arrive...I kept thinking, \"girls please stay strong and don't fall for those idiots... I'm begging you.\"But I found it laughable when Adina was all:\u201cGood God! All you had to do was introduce the scent of testosterone and perfectly capable, together girls were reduced to giggling, lash-batting, hair-playing idiots. She hated it when girls did this. When they got all goo-goo-eyed over Y chromosome\u2013carrying creatures instead of taking care of themselves. It\u2019s what her mother had done her whole life, cater to some man instead of looking after herself. Or Adina.\u201dUntil a boy bumps into her, in which case she turned all:\u201cLet me help you with that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need your help,\u201d Adina called, but Duff was already wading into the water. This was the problem with men. They just assumed. They just took action. It was infuriating. And reductive. And slightly thrilling.The wet clung to Duff\u2019s pants as he strode into the surf, and she could see the curve of his ass. Man, he was fine.\u201dGet your head in the game\u2014I swear, I thought they were trouble!But okay, I did grow to like Sinjin (mostly because of Petra). And yeah, I also liked his silly humor and the way he didn\u2019t take himself too seriously.\u201cPetra looked up to the moon as if appealing to its grace. She liked this one and wanted more, but she was afraid there was no hope of that.\u201cSorry, I just \u2026 So you used to be a guy. J. T. Woodland. Of Boyz Will B Boyz.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can tell you\u2019re freaked out.\u201dPetra started to get up. Sinjin took her wrist gently. \u201cWell, yeah. But mostly because you used to be in Boyz Will B Boyz. That\u2019s unbelievable! I mean, you played Top of the Pops!\u201dPetra allowed a small smile. He had surprised her. That didn\u2019t happen often. She sat down again. \u201cShould I tell you the story?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHow much should I tell you?\u201d\u201cEverything.\u201dI really, really liked them.\u201cCarefully, he tucked a strand of hair behind Petra\u2019s ear and let his hand rest for a moment against the soft, wide plain of her cheekbone. \u201cI think you\u2019re beautiful. And brave. And really fucking cool. And you can make Charles Dickens puns.\u201dPetra leaned the weight of her face into Sinjin\u2019s palm. \u201cYou know who and what I am. So, if this is just the old curiosity shop, you can stop right now.\u201dSinjin looked her in the eyes. There was not a trace of smirk in his expression. \u201c\u2018I hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any evil or misfortune in the world.\u2019\u201d\u201cDavid Copperfield,\u201d Petra whispered, positioning her lips close to his.\u201cWhy are you bringing magicians into it?\u201d Sinjin said and kissed her tenderly. It was a kiss small in its ministrations but epic in its feeling.\u201d...Libba Bray sure knows how to shut me up. I mean, how could I forget that she's a master at writing swoon worthy romances????Like, damn. That scene with Adina and Duff in the cabin made me sweat. But then...when his true assholish behaviour was revealed, I was appalled.\u201cShe tapped Duff on the arm. He tipped his head back to look up at her. \u201cHello, Mary Lou.\u201d\u201cCould you stand up, please?\u201dDuff gave the boys an I-wonder-what-this-is-about look. \u201cSure thing.\u201d He stood and faced Mary Lou. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cThis.\u201d Mary Lou\u2019s fist connected with Duff\u2019s face in an audible crunch. He tottered like a drunk. And if there had been a clock on the island, it would have ticked off exactly three seconds before he lost consciousness and went down hard in the sand.\u201cOw!\u201d Mary Lou shook out her hand. Then she took her place at the fire and drank the rest of Duff\u2019s coconut milk, drinking till she was sated.\u201dAnd thank you, Mary Lou, for handling the situation like a pro. I won't forget Duff's awfulness anytime soon.The hurt was a pain in the center of my chest. And his 'apology' was so half-hearted, it only made things worse for me.But the girls didn't let those bumps along the road falter the course of their actions.\u201cWe could take the world by storm, you know? It\u2019ll be like we proved ourselves, like all those heroes\u2019 journey stories about boys, only we\u2019re girls.\u201dAt its core this book was a very character driven one, which was my favorite thing. We had an incredible wide cast of characters that I connected with one way or another.I found myself in Petra\u2019s determination, in Shanti's soundness, in Nicole's sensibleness, in Taylor\u2019s unwavering commitment, and I could go on and on \u2014but bottom line, these girls made me feel at home.I think it\u2019s safe to say that Libba Bray has got my heart with all these remarkably fleshed-out characters. I'm still moony-eyed after everything.To put it simply, Beauty Queens - at heart - is a sad sort of beautiful. Like all the best books.\u201cThere was something about the island that made the girls forget who they had been. All those rules and shalt nots. They were no longer waiting for some arbitrary grade. They were no longer performing. Waiting. Hoping.They were becoming.They were.\u201dAlso, I have to mention this next tiny detail because it warmed my heart:\"COMMERCIAL BREAK(A high school hallway. A girl, MARCIA, slams her locker door in frustration. She looks haggard. NATALIE and RACHEL stand off to one side, watching and shaking their heads.)\"What are the chances that both my name and my sister\u2019s name (Rachel) would be on the same page?My reaction to it totally reminded me of this vine.4.5 stars*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

Normally, I don't mind writing negative reviews - in fact, much for the same reason I always get a little thrill when someone trolls my reviews, I sort of enjoy doling out negative criticism (for the psychology behind this, please refer to Anton Ego's monologue on criticism at the end of Ratatouille) Especially when it's an author I dislike - I can and will trash Twilight until its memory is wiped from the earth, but things get complicated when it comes time to give a negative review of an author I like. Because, lest you get any other ideas, I love Libba Bray. I loved A Great and Terrible Beauty, I loved Going Bovine, and I think she personally is brilliant and funny and I would love to hang out with her and talk about books and history and James Bond all damn day.But I try to base my reviewing style off the advice of Lester Bangs, which is that \"you have to make your reputation on being honest...and unmerciful.\" So. Honest and unmerciful. Here we go. So, the basic plot: a plane carrying the fifty contestants of the Miss Teen Dream pageant crashes on an island, killing all but thirteen of the competitors. The girls have to figure out how to survive on their own and learn who they really are, while also questioning their own reasons for being in the pageant in the first place. Meanwhile, the mysterious Corporation, who controls the pageant along with everything else on TV, advertising, and possibly the whole country, is working on its own dastardly plot connected with the pageants. Also there are sexy pirates. (oh, don't worry, I'll get to them)I don't understand why there are so few negative reviews of this book. Before I read it, all I knew about it was from the many glowing reviews praising the book's humor, its brilliant message, its terrific characters, etc. Maybe these people are seeing something I'm not. Maybe I'm a moron. But for whatever reason, here are the big problems I found with this book, boiled down to some key points: -Regularly Spits In the Face of Logic. Not real-world logic, which is fine to disregard, but the logic that the world of the story has already established. There's a part where two of the characters are talking about money they spend on pageants, and one girl is shocked when the other tells her how much the average pageant gown costs. Hang on - you're in a pageant as the story takes place, and you don't know how much pageant gowns cost? Buh? Similarly, there are just too many coincidences to put up with. First a plane full of beauty queens crashes on a deserted island, conveniently killing off any adults or authority figures. But surprise! the island is also inhabited by a Corporation stronghold. And meanwhile, a sexy eco warrior is camped out on the island (I am not making any of that up). And then a boat carrying the sexy young cast of a pirate TV show crashes on the island, with at least one hot boy who is perfect for each of our main characters. Up until the very last page, I was waiting for Bray to reveal that the entire thing - the crash, the pirates, the comically-evil corporate villains - had all been staged from the beginning as the pilot for some awesome new reality TV show. But no. There was no staging. It all actually happened, and I don't understand how or why. -It's Super Easy to Be in a Pageant, Apparently. Adina, our sort-of protagonist, is an aspiring journalist who's only in the pageant so she can write a tell-all article about it. Fine, but this is a national pageant. How in the hell did she fake her way to getting the Miss New Hampshire crown, beating out hundreds of other girls who have been doing this for real since they were children? For god's sake, at least Gracie Hart had the FBI rigging the competition so she could get to the Top Ten. And Adina's not even the only one - another character does the pageant to make a social statement, and another one does it because she's won everything else already. Jesus, from the way this book makes pageants sound, anybody can win a trophy with no experience or genuine effort!-It's All So Very, Very Satirical. This book is a satire, I get that. But the satire is all so broad, so winkingly obvious, that after the second \"commercial break\" I was tired of it. Bray goes for the obvious jokes and stereotypes (a religious, gun-loving Texan character? How innovative!) without delving deeper into who these girls are and why they do pageants (short answer, according to this book: either to make a social statement, or childhood trauma). All the satire is so heavy-handed that it practically bruises, and the story gets too bogged down in its own jokes. The book seems to be begging us to applaud its cleverness as it hits us with a barrage of made-up pop culture references and fake TV show titles and jokes that have no business being there at all, except to get another laugh out of us (the funniest line in the book, in fact, makes no sense in the context it's delivered and is completely unnecessary) -The Protagonist is the Wrong Girl. The character of Taylor starts out as the villain - a serious, religious pageant veteran who has total faith in the Miss Teen Dream philosophy and message. She seems like the bad guy, but when she finds out that the rescue has been called off and the girls have been abandoned, she snaps. We learn about her traumatic childhood, her need to be perfect and accepted and loved, and then Taylor goes full Rambo and starts living by herself in the jungle, taking out the bad guys one by one like a crazy ninja armed with hairspray. This story is awesome, but it has to take a backseat to all the other girls and the stupid, stupid pirate romance bullshit that really should have been left out completely. -Femin...ish? I have a bad habit of analyzing things from a feminist viewpoint (I went to a women's college, it's part of my programming) when they don't deserve to be analyzed that way. But Beauty Queens is set up as a modern feminist manifesto, railing against the pageant system and our standards of beauty and who girls are expected to be in today's world...and it only works a little bit. Like the satirical elements, all the feminist messages are slammed in our faces with no subtly. Adina, our Token Empowered Girl, speaks in cliched feminist slogans like \"I don't need a man to define me\" and the characters all have very obvious conversations about how much society sucks if you're a girl. Heavy-handed doesn't begin to describe it.And at the same time, there's an odd insistence on the importance of the girls' love lives. First there's the girl who sexes up the eco warrior, which I guess is fine because the chapter was really about her reclaiming her sexuality and not being afraid of her own desires, but then the hot pirates show up and it all goes to hell as various girls lose their damn minds over the sexy, sexy boys - even our Feminist Icon, Adina, is powerless when faced with sensitive bad boys who share some of her interests. I could put up with all of that, if there was a legitimate reason for the pirates to be in the book. But I've thought about it, and I honestly cannot come up with a single compelling reason that they should have been included at all. They have almost no effect on the overall plot, and anything they do manage to accomplish could have easily been done by other characters. They served no purpose, and I wish they'd been cut out of the story entirely.-What's the Message, Again? It feels like Bray is trying to write two different books here. On the one hand, we have a campy, outrageous pageant caper with maniacal villains, outrageous escapes, and general balls-out hilarity; and then we have a serious social statement about girls today and who society wants them to be. There are some very good ideas in this book - it's inspired, in part, by Lord of the Flies and discusses (when it's not throwing out pop culture jokes and romance subplots) the idea that girls need an island of their own, where they don't have to worry about being who everyone else wants them to be and discover who they really are. But it doesn't mesh with the silly, campy mood that defines the rest of the book. How can we take these girls' opinions about societal pressures seriously when the villains have a secret lair in a volcano with a self-destruct system that can be overridden by making a Powerpoint presentation (again, not making this up). To use a tired expression, Bray is trying to have her cake and eat it too, and the result is a jumbled mess of a book that can\u2019t decide where it\u2019s going or what it wants to be. (sort of like the girls in the story \u2013 hey, maybe the whole format is an allegory! Well, you think of a better explanation)"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/763271-nancy", "userReview": "Cross-posted at Outlaw Reviews and at Shelf Inflicted I was on the fence about this book. A story about teen beauty pageant contestants stranded on a desert island just doesn\u2019t do anything for me. After reading Stephanie's review, I decided to try the audio version. At first, I thought it was ridiculous, irritating and just plain stupid. It wasn\u2019t long before I was laughing and snorting in public places. In the beginning, it was a little difficult to get to know the characters. The story is told from different perspectives and it was hard for me to get all the girls straight. Some of them had unique qualities and \u201csecrets\u201d that made them stand out, while others were a little flat and unmemorable. I loved the Miss Teen Dream Fun Facts Page, the wacky footnotes that explained products and status symbols, famous personalities, and TV shows, like \u201cBridal Death Match, the popular TV show about brides who cage fight each other in order to win the wedding of their dreams.\u201dThis story is a satire about the superficiality of consumer culture, politics, and mega-corporations that control everything we watch, read, and buy. It deals with racism, disability, and sexuality. There is adventure, mystery, and a dollop of romance. There are important messages here about survival, friendship, beauty, acceptance, independence, and what it means to be a woman. Hilarious, empowering, honest, and highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "In Lord of the Flies by William Golding, the boys wrecked and alone on an island act as Golding says boys being true to their nature will. And it ain't pretty, gangs, anarchism, bullying, murder... It's a brilliant book.So is Libba Bray's. What she has to say about women in Beauty Queens also wrecked and alone on an island, is that even the most dedicated fashionista of a girl with her acrylic nails and furry false eyelashes is solid when she has to be. In real life, these girls go home in the evening kick off their stiletto heels, put on some jeans and see to the kids. Dinner, homework, ironing school uniform, making lunch boxes, and putting them to bed is the minimum amount of work. If they have a partner, it gets even more complicated.Only then, only after they have looked after the family do they touch up their acrylics and add another coat to their toenails and ring the girlfriends for gossip, scandal and plans. Next day, when the kids have been breakfasted and sent on their way and the laundry loaded into the machine, our heroine will again be ghetto-fabulous with glossy pouted lips and looking like she wasn't really made of steel at all.That's women, and Libba Bray got it in this geniusly funny book where every taboo, social norm and anything that gets in the way of women being true to themselves is knocked about and eventually trampled underfoot by all. All the girls will come to see their true worth although some of them do hang on to their self-image as dumb blonde but pretty until forced out of it by necessity. All the girls are different and some when they define themselves as capable women without any need to impress with looks will finds paths far different from that of the beauty pageant they were on their way to enter.This isn't to say that all women are good cookies, no there are the truly evil sociopathic baddies too. Close to the ending the plot goes haywire (in a good way) and a very manipulative woman based on a real-life character is revealed. A bit of googling and you can easily find out who she is. To say more would be a spoiler.This should be read alongside Lord of the Flies in school, but it won't be. It's too much fun, too many (actually not enough) lipsticks and definitely not literary enough. It is a 5 star read, and a good boost to confidence for teenage girls who think that looks are enough. They aren't unless they aspire to be in the Playboy Mansion or be famous like the Kardashian trash which is more than sad. They should read this book and see that they can do anything at all they want and still like putting on the paint and pouting for a selfie.Read Dec 31,2014, reviewed Aug 22, 2015"}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "This was a ridiculously fun book!

This book is a little bit of this:And this:This:This:With a bit of this:And this:thrown in.It's basically about a group of teens on their way to a beauty pageant who get stuck on an island after their plane crashes and have to figure out a way to survive and get along with each other. There's a lot of humor in this book and a lot of messages about feminism and capitalism. It's a huge satire about beauty pageant culture, the way society looks at females, and how ridiculous Big Business is about profits and covering up product flaws because of profit.When I started it, I really thought this would be a 4-star read, but after awhile, I felt like the story could have been told in about 200-250 pages rather than almost 400. The funny parts started to get stale and the in-between corporate spoofs got old as well. It almost seemed like the boy band pirate reality-TV section was unnecessary and bloated the book. It kind of took a little away from the feminist themes and provided a convenient HEA for a couple of characters and was used as a plot device that could have been resolved another way. Maybe it's just me?Anyhow, this was amusing and funny and I liked the political messages, but it just went on and on for too long and sapped my initial enthusiasm. Still a good read if you are looking for something humorous and kind of fluffy.Oh, and let me just add that this book did a great job of demonstrating a wide range of diverse characters in a positive light, while also blatantly making jokes of racial and sexual stereotypes. Oh, I also really appreciated just how bizarre and quirky this was. If only it hadn't been stretched out so much. I feel I have to dock a star for that because I started skimming at about 80%. I just felt like the book should have ended by that point. ? Read my friend Kelly's review because it's awesome and is what made me want to read this to begin with!

Just meh. Beauty Queens is not at all what I expected. What I expected was a group of beauty queens crash land on an isolated island and it's not long before the ruthlessness of the pageant morphs into a violent \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, a la Lord of the Flies. I would have also settled for a dark and biting satire on consumerism and pop culture. Alas, what I got was an increasingly irritating \"Girl Power!\" message that never quite got off the ground as it never quite rejected everything it didactically preached against. As a message of female empowerment, it has all the depth of Day-to-Night Barbie (oh, how I remember that Barbie in her pink, tailored \"go-getter\" workplace dress that conveniently converted into a sparkly tulle evening number, proving to little girls that we could be serious and glamorous while we had it all).To begin with, the novel was far too long and tried to pack in too much for what it was. Beauty queens crashing onto a deserted island is more than enough for a quirky, humorous read, but Bray packs everything she possibly can into the novel: pop culture gags, pro-LGBT messages, reclamation of female sexuality, skewerings of materialism and consumerism, secret lairs and evil mega-corporations. Hell, there's even an evil dictator named Mo-Mo who is a thinly veiled version of Kim Jong-Il. And on top of all of this is a thick layer of \"You're perfect just the way you are!\" frosting that makes everything A-Okay.Now I'm a fan of all of these messages (and I especially applaud Bray for including lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters). The problem is that the characters start off as stereotypical beauty queens, focused only on cosmetics, weight, dresses, and winning. The disconnect from society provided by the island gives them the opportunity to explore who they truly are without the consumer and societal \"noise\" telling girls what they should be. This is all well and good, but the girls seem to undergo an inauthentic sea-change in personality after building a few huts and sewing sparkly banners to attract help. They then become more intellectual, empowered versions of themselves, but no less stereotypical: the prickly feminist, the smart Indian girl, the tough lesbian, the defiant deaf girl, and the dumb bimbo who is trying, like, really hard to be smart. And then there is the tiny contingent of girls who survive for no other reason than to shoot off one-liners and help move the plot along. They're never given any depth or dimension, and are never really referred to by anything other than their \"Miss . . . \" title. The only interesting character is Taylor, the ultimate pageant girl, who finally snaps and, in a nod to Heart of Darkness and maybe even Tim O'Brien's Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong, becomes one with the violence that has always lain dormant within her.Bray vacillates between slapstick humor and serious messages. While I did enjoy the first few chapters and there were some lines that made me laugh, most of the humor was predictable and inspired only an eye-roll as I turned the page. Unfortunately, the smart stuff, the stuff that needs to be recognized and addressed, becomes lost in the fluff. The novel's own inane silliness ultimately downplays what could have been a more powerful exploration of being a girl in today's society. Or it could have been just a fun powder puff of a novel. Either way, it would have been better than what it ultimately turned out to be. I suppose I could be accused of taking this more seriously than I should have, but I think the same argument could be made of Bray. By the ending chapter, the girls dance their way off the stage while the narrator tells us what they're wearing and gives a synopsis of what their future lives hold. Like Day-to-Night Barbie, they look fabulous and have fabulously successful lives. For the same reason I ultimately got rid of Barbie, I think I'll get rid of Beauty Queens.Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder"}, {"userName": "Deanna ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna", "userReview": "I read this a few years ago and usually I don't remember much about a book after that long unless it was a particularly good read. This is one of those books that stayed with me because it was just so entertaining. I forgot to update my Goodreads with it but happened across a GR friends review and remembered. I saw somewhere that someone said it's like \"Lost\" meets \"Clueless\" and I think that that is an accurate description...although maybe I would add \"Mean Girls\" and \"Toddlers & Tiara's\" to the mix. Beauty Queen tantrums are probably similar at any age.... The Miss Teen Dream Pageant contestants are on their way to an island rehearsals before the big show when their plane crashes on a desert island. Many of the contestants and ALL of the adult chaperons perish in the crash.....only 13 beauty queens survive. However, there are not just the beauty queens on the island. We have not normal pirates but REALITY TV pirates! Also the psychotic CEO of the company (and former beauty queen) who is all about the money no matter what. Plus other characters who add that much more to the story. We also have \"The Corporation\" as a character and have little footnotes, interviews and even commercial breaks!So what do you get when 13 beauty queens are stranded on a desert island without adequate supplies? The answer is not quite what you might expect. Witty, over-the-top, tongue in cheek humour and funny situations yes but also a good dose of empowerment and self-discovery as the beauty queens try to survive.

I would actually watch a show with pirate rock stars.So this is satire. Before you read this book, it is important to know that it is not meant to be taken seriously. If you find yourself hating certain characters, they were probably written that way for a reason. I generally like satire, parodies, or anything using some form of ironic wit to make a greater point - in small doses. I think it's very hard to carry an entire book of over-exaggerated humor without people getting tired of it after a certain point. For me, the exhaustion hit somewhere around the 30% mark. Bray's observances about the flaws within the beauty industry in general were spot-on and I appreciated that. However, I still felt like the ideas were getting stale after a while.On the positive side, Bray's wit was hilarious. I admit to grinning at a lot of the dialogue. On the negative side, by adding in the commercial breaks and extra commentary from the corporation (and t.v. show angle), it took a fun concept and stretched it out far past an acceptable length for the story. I kept thinking that if the book had been focused only a plane crash and the contestants of the pageant, that it could have been so much better. I wonder how much more I would have enjoyed this if the point of view had been scaled back to one main focus instead of jumping around all over the place. If things had been different, I could easily see giving this book 4 stars. But for what this was, I feel the need to state that the complaints were more about what I do and don't like and not a reflection on if the book was a success or not. I already knew before this that Bray could write her ass off and she continued to prove that here with Beauty Queens. I can't fault the author for choosing the format that she chose for this story, but it's not a format that I preferred to read here. It's just a personal preference.You've never read satire? Well, here's a sample.\n\"My head kinda hurts,\" Miss New Mexico said. Several of the girls gasped. Half of an airline serving tray was lodged in her forehead, forming a small blue canopy over her eyes.\"What is it?\" Miss New Mexico checked to make sure her bra straps weren't showing.Some girls argued over whether the death of Miss Massachusetts - favored by the bookies to win the whole thing - meant that the competition would never feel entirely fair.They were going to replace it with that show about Amish girls who share a house with strippers, Girls Gone Rumpsringa?\"My mom let me use that song for my Christian pole dancing routine.\"\"I want to pursue a career in the exciting world of weight-management broadcast journalism.

She easily and cogently maneuvered switching POVs, even that of a deranged dictator with a penchant for Elvis wigs. It was very easy to imagine Libba Bray having lots of fun writing this, while (perhaps) chugging a bottle of Vodka, for her to come up with Man Flower and General Good Times.It started out very strong and continued on until the sexy pirates arrived, with their washboard abs, lush hair, tight breeches and British accent.Imagine 3 of him...and 2 of him wash ashore on your deserted island...ugh the horrorIn Adina's own words:\"All you had to do was introduce the scent of testosterone and perfectly capable, together girls were reduced to giggling, lash-batting, hair-playing idiots.\"Trust me, that is something I never thought I'd ever say, but there it is, the hot pirates kind of burned the 1.5 stars away from me.Overall though I recommend this read for General Good Times.PS. I apologize for the pathetic metaphor, there were just too many Ladybird Hope pageant metaphors.

(I know only one really did the soccer thing, but I feel like that idea was there for a lot of them.) It was just a little anti-climactic. But, Adina and Taylor actually really made me sad. I am reading this book Motherless Daughters \u2013 because that is what I am \u2013 and it is a devastatingly poignant book for me. Those two girls are the motherless daughters in the book (Taylor from physical abandonment, and Adina from emotional abandonment), and it made me really sad that they were still so lost at the end of the book. I know there is a sort of power in the way they are lost, with Taylor as the jungle queen, and Adina refusing to sell her soul for emotional affirmation from men. Still, though, they made me sad. They were that stigma of the motherless daughter, the thing we can\u2019t talk about because it is too devastating. What if all of our mothers left us? It doesn\u2019t seem fair to me to think of those girls as being unable to emotionally connect with other people in a sane and mutually giving way. And Shanti and Nicole felt a little funny to me in that way, too. The book goes into how marginalizing the token ethnic friend thing is, but just because you\u2019re recognizing it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not doing it yourself. It was just slightly uncomfortable. I mean, those girls were lovely, and I really like them, but I felt like, rather than be the sassy ethnic friend, they were only a reaction to the sassy ethnic friend. They didn\u2019t have much more dimension than that. Jennifer and Petra were a little better than that, I thought. They both had more humanity and specificity, even thought they were so purposely put in the book so that there would be one of each. I\u2019m okay with that, though. Again, I liked the girls.

Y entonces tuve una epifan\u00eda: Tal vez no soy yo la que est\u00e1 equivocada. Tal vez quien lo est\u00e1 sea esta demente naci\u00f3n que cree que no debemos hacer otra cosa que ir de compras, retocar nuestra imagen, y perseguir un ideal inalcanzable de romance o conformarse con alg\u00fan idiota en vez de descubrirnos a nosotras mismas y vivir la vida al m\u00e1ximo. Si vas a leer Beauty Queens esperando un libro de supervivencia. Definitivamente este no es tu libro porque la manera en que salen de las situaciones es muy bizarra, fantasiosa e incre\u00edble sin dejar de ser divertido.  Si esperan un romance en el que aparecen los piratas sexys y salvan a las chicas (porque ellas solas no pueden hacer nada *sarcasmo*) se van llevar otra decepci\u00f3n porque  los piratas no tienen un papel muy importante en el libro y porque las chicas (obviamente) son capaces de sobrevivir y salvarse ellas mismas. \u00bfC\u00f3mo definir\u00eda a Beauty Queens? Este libro es una s\u00e1tira, una cr\u00edtica a la sociedad.  Es un libros sobre un grupo de chicas que debido a la rape culture donde vivimos fingen ser algo que no son, y son presionadas a hacer cosas que no les gustan para cumplir con lo que se espera de ellas SOLO por ser mujeres.  PERO que al estar en la isla aprenden a aceptarse, respetarse y quererse a s\u00ed mismas. Y se dan cuenta que \u00a1pueden ser lo que ellas quieran! Una periodista, doctora, DJ, dise\u00f1adora de interiores, pirata. \u00a1Lo que sea!Quiz\u00e1 si no son feministas no lo sienten tan presente a todo lo que se critica en el libro (sobre todo el slut-shaming o la presi\u00f3n de tener que casarse y tener hijos) pero espero que les abra los ojos.  En libro hay de todo. Es tan refrescante ver tanta diversidad de personajes. Tenemos (no voy a decir el nombre de las chicas as\u00ed se \u201csorprenden\u201d mientras lo leen) a: una chica sorda que tiene que soportar que los dem\u00e1s la dejen de lado y ni siquiera se tomen el tiempo de aprender el lenguaje de se\u00f1as, una chica que disfruta del sexo pero tiene que \u201creprimirse\u201d porque si ella disfruta del sexo seg\u00fan nuestra sociedad ESO la convierte en una puta (that\u2019s bullshit, I know), una chica negra que tiene que soportar constantemente la discriminaci\u00f3n y que la vean como \u201cla representante\u201d de toda una etnia (raza) en vez de verla a ella por lo que es, una chica lesbiana y una chica transexual que tienen que soportar la discriminaci\u00f3n de una sociedad que no las acepta, una chica feminista que tiene que soportar que la vean como una anti-hombres, que \u201cseguro es feminista porque es fea y ning\u00fan hombre va a querer estar con ella\u201d (me sent\u00ed muy identificada con ella).\nAprend\u00ed que si un chico que finge ser un pirata, te dice que no es m\u00e1s que problemas, probablemente sea cierto. As\u00ed que tienes que encontrar a alguien m\u00e1s, porque ah\u00ed afuera hay algunos chicos realmente geniales, y chicas tambi\u00e9n. Aprend\u00ed que el feminismo es para todos y no hay nada malo en tomar tu lugar en el mundo, incluso si tienes que pelear por ello un poco, y que si no te sientes con \u00e1nimo como para saludar y sonre\u00edr, est\u00e1 bien. No tienes que hacerlo, y no tienes que decir que lo sientes \nAs\u00ed que ya saben chicas:\n1) Si un chico te trata mal NO es porque te quiere, sino porque es un imb\u00e9cil.2)Que disfrutes del sexo no te convierte en una puta (ugh, odio esa palabra) as\u00ed mismo el no querer tener relaciones no te convierte en una mojigata. 3) Que seas feminista no quiere decir que odies a los hombres (sino que crees en la igualdad de g\u00e9neros).4)NO necesitas a un chico para sentirte completa. 5)Podes vivir tu sexualidad como quieras. 6)Podes ser lo que vos quieras, seguir la profesi\u00f3n que quieras y si no te casas o tenes hijos NO QUIERE DECIR QUE SEAS UNA PERDEDORA.7)La objetivaci\u00f3n sexual de la mujer y del hombre est\u00e1 mal.8)Ac\u00e9ptate a vos misma, querete, resp\u00e9tate (y que no se te ocurra discriminar a otras mujeres)."}, {"userName": "Romie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33510193-romie", "userReview": "It\u2019s a book I never thought I would read. Simply because the synopsis didn\u2019t sound that great to me. But people kept talking about it, so I thought \u2018Why not?\u2019 and I\u2019m glad I gave it a try.This book follows thirteen teenage girls - pageant beauty queens - after their plane crashed on a deserted island. At least that\u2019s what they thought.Beauty Queens doesn\u2019t take itself seriously. It\u2019s probably one of the most hilarious books I\u2019ve ever read. But it\u2019s also one of the most important.It\u2019s important because it deals with feminism, misogyny, immigration, sexuality . . . and it doesn\u2019t shy away from telling things the way they are.It\u2019s one of the most diverse books I\u2019ve had the pleasure to read : Adina is Jewish, Sosie is deaf and bisexual, Jennifer is a lesbian, Nicole is African-American, Shanti is Indian-American, and Petra is transgender.In this book, each girl has to deal with what society taught them : how a girl should look like, the way an African-American girl should act, how an Indian-American girl should talk . . .It\u2019s hard to talk about this book because so many things happened! Each character gets their own story but talking about them isn\u2019t easy.Adina is trying to be everything her mother who had 5 husbands - each being The One - isn\u2019t. She has this big idea of who she wants to be : hardcore feminist who doesn\u2019t need no man in her life, someone who can openly talk about masturbation and sex, someone with a bright future ahead, someone who uses her brain . . . and she is this person, but she\u2019s also more. She\u2019s a best friend, she is a girl who wants to be free from her own nightmares.Mary Lou doesn\u2019t know who she is without her family, without her mom\u2019s approval. She has no clue. But in this book, she learns what it\u2019s like to really be free, to be herself, and to be loved for who she is and not what society wants her to be. She\u2019s a pure sunshine who just wants to have some fun once in her life.Nicole wants to be a doctor - a surgeon please - but people look down on her . . . they look down on her because they think her skin colour is something she should be ashamed of constantly, even her mom does think so. Being black in this world of white is her biggest fight, and she\u2019s tired. She just wants to be Nicole, with her wild hair and full knowledge of the human body.Shanti is trying hard to be the perfect stereotype of the Indian-American girl, because isn\u2019t it what people want to hear? She\u2019s afraid people won\u2019t find her interesting if she turns out to be someone real, not just a stereotype.Sosie is tired of people being like \u2018poor Sosie, she can\u2019t hear well, but look how hard she works to be one of us\u2019 . . . she\u2019s deaf, deal with it. She\u2019s not here to educate you on what it means to be deaf, she\u2019s not here to teach you a cute language - signing is how she communicates every day, not something to entertain you. She\u2019s dealing with her feelings for both girls and boys, it\u2019s a bit confused right now in her head, but she\u2019s not afraid of what\u2019s to come.Jennifer was always the invisible one, always had to act like she\u2019s tough and not scared of anything, but she is. She\u2019s scared of being rejected, scared of not fitting, because\u2019s she gay, and a nerd, because people will always judge her based on stereotypes. But there is more to her : she willing to learn anything if you take the time to teach her, she has a brilliant mind and she cares about her friends.Petra is scared of what people will think once they discover she\u2019s transgender, scared of being seen as a freak, a curiosity . . . but she learns to trust her friends, to open up to people who find themselves worthy of her time and patience and love.I\u2019m not going to talk about the plot, because I want it to stay a surprise. Just know that this book is about girls kicking the world\u2019s ass and being badass ladies, surviving on a deserted island when everybody thought they wouldn\u2019t survive a day. Basically this book is a big fuck you to our misogynist world. And it was delightful.Shanti gives the signal. \u201cOne . . .\u201d\u201cTwo . . .\u201d Nicole seconds.\u201cThree!\u201d Adina says.As one, they leap, laughing, and that is where we leave them - mouths open, arms spread wide, fingers splayed to take in the whole world, bodies flying high in defiance of gravity, as if they will never fall.4.5"}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose", "userReview": "Whoa, where do I start on Libba Bray's \"Beauty Queens\"? I haven't had a book completely blindside me as far as content goes for quite some time. I'm clearly at a loss for words as I write this review, because 1. I'm trying not to hold my sides from laughing so much at this book, and 2. I don't quite know how to explain \"Beauty Queens\" appeal when it has so many elements in it that work, but theoretically shouldn't. That might sound odd, but I'll explain it as I go into further detail.I went into this novel with one idea of what it would be about, but was completely surprised when it turned several measures on its head and ran with them. There were times when I thought \"Oh no, Bray did not just go there,\" and pretty much in the scheme of events, Bray's response was \"Yes, I did go there, and I'll take it one step further.\" A word of warning: this novel tackles satire and dark humor alongside addressing diversity, commercialism (very heavy amount of commercialism), sexuality, feminism/gender roles, among other measures. I firmly believe that this book will not be a one size fits all in terms of how it comes across.And yet I loved, no, adored this book. It made me laugh for a good portion of the read. There were some things I had to swallow with a huge spoon of sugar, but I think Bray's work had a lot of heart behind it. Not so much on the developmental side as much as it was on the \"off-the-cuff\", eye to stereotyping that seems to poke fun at itself whenever it can. And yet it had many important things to say about being true to who you are and not giving into the mixed messages that are sold to you in society - that's what I came out of it with and I do appreciate that Bray chose to tell this tale the way she told it. Heck, I didn't know Bray had a background in marketing, and with the commercial incorporation in this book, I thought the way she delivered them were brilliant. The footnotes were a fun add as well (and this was one of the times I would say they were done very well in fiction).The long and short of what this book is about is this: a group of teen beauty queens from the United States crash land on a deserted island and are left to fend for and among themselves. Some of them make it, some of them don't, but this novel is about the ones that do. You'd think this would be slightly depressing, but it has this cheerful snark that doesn't hesitate to punch where it can. There's a fair helping of characters here that are somewhat stereotypical. Token confident Texas girl (who pulls a Rena* a good way into the novel), token dim-witted beauty, token minorities, token girl with a disability, etc. Technically, token characters would have me on my toes to protest and rage, but the sharp humor they put across somehow endeared me to them. I gradually got to know them as more than their purported portrayals, even if there were certain places where the novel developed them and became a little sluggish in the process. The humor was very self aware, and Bray doesn't hesitate to turn certain troupes on their heads and come across with them in ways you'd least expect. There are quite a bit of characters to keep up with, but surprisingly I got to know each of them. What made the backbone of this novel was the way they interacted with each other to survive and while I wouldn't say the changes within them were necessarily deep, detailed or profound, they were noteworthy and showcased a clear growth from where they were in the beginning of the novel.The girls are all a part of the pageant for their own reasons, some even having quite a bit of secrets to hide, but the reveals are fun, and ultimately as the novel goes forward, there are a number of colorful characters that the girls come across that even add to the enjoyment of the novel. I actually ended up enjoying the pirates with the hot abs, even. =PIn the end, this was a fun novel that I enjoyed immensely for my first read from Bray, and I would not hesitate to re-read it again. I recommend it for those who want a funny story with some strong witty commentary about contemporary society, female empowerment, and just a very different read from the typical YA spectrum.Overall score: 4/5*Note: Rena is a character from the anime series Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. If you have ever seen that series, you would kind of know what I'm talking about. :P"}, {"userName": "Dana Kenedy (Dana and the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/372001-dana-kenedy-dana-and-the-books", "userReview": "A lot funnier than I expected.

Actually, I wish I had enough money to buy every girl from the age of 15 to 21 a copy of this book. I bow down to Libba Bray for pulling off such a crazy concept - a plane of beauty pageant contestants crash on an island - when it could have gone horribly wrong in the hands of a less competent author.On the outside, Beauty Queens is about an ensemble of shallow, teenaged girls surviving on an island. But, just like the girls themselves, it offers much more. Bray tackles a wide array of tough subjects like male vs. female double standards and GLBT tolerance with skillful satire and impressive honesty.Some books you read in silence. Beauty Queens isn't one of those books. Libba Bray holds nothing back in her upbraiding of the superficial nature of society, yet it never gets overwhelming - the humor in this book is wonderfully witty and refreshing. I laughed out loud so many times I regret not buying a copy so I could note when the funniest moments took place. Almost every other page contained a joke or wisecrack that made me smile, like when one contestant states the importance of aiding non-Americans after being asked her favorite color.I probably haven't done this book justice, so I'll just tell you to go out and get a copy to read. ASAP. I had my doubts after reading and disliking Going Bovine by Bray, but Beauty Queens has placed her on my list of authors to watch out for. Definitely recommended.*cross-posted from my blog the quiet voice."}, {"userName": "Jackie \"the Librarian\"", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian", "userReview": "Hate reality tv and think the world is going to hell because of how shallow the American culture is? Libba Bray agrees with you. Beauty Queens is an awesome, extremely strong satire sending up: - reality tv  - beauty pageants - advertising - arms dealing - international diplomacy - and Gilligan's IslandBeauty contestants crash land on an island, and it's a battle for survival with nothing but beauty products! Yes, it can come across like Libba Bray hitting you over the head with all of this like a baseball bat. But her target is not the reader, but the subjects. She's just that frustrated! And so am I. I can't watch tv anymore. I don't care about makeovers, or dating, or celebrities, and the ads seem to take up more time than the actual programming these days. And because really, can MTV get any worse? Wait, don't answer that. Our pop culture is really abysmal right now. Just think about how much news time will Kim Kardashian's divorce get. Way more time than it should, especially when we have a population that thinks a flat tax is a good way to fix this country's problems. Not that this country has ever been that deep. Just think about Gilligan's Island. Okay, you can stop now. So, there's the satire, which I appreciated. But there was also some lovely character development I didn't expect. I liked how the contestants used their knowledge and skills to survive being marooned, and I wanted more of that. Gee, these girls actually ARE talented, not just airheads. I wish all of the girls had been treated like real people - I was distressed for the poor contestant whose only attribute was to have a tray table stuck in her head. I also liked how the relationships, both heterosexual and same-sex ones were treated seriously, as was the topic of sex and contraception. Libba Bray, I salute you!
