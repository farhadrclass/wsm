A Berger novel that was boring, wordy, and, as far as I could tell, pointless. I made it through over a third of it and finally had to pack it in. Unbelievable that this is the same Berger who wrote Sneaky People and Little Big Man and The Feud. If everyone is entitled to an off day, Berger had his with this.(And yes, I have read Kafta's The Trial so I understand what he was aiming for--I just didn't care at all about the road he was taking to get there.)"}, {"userName": "Aaron Martz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15201542-aaron-martz", "userReview": "This funny but slight comedy is Berger's take on Kafka's The Trial. It stars Russel Wren, the private investigator from Berger's earlier and more funny Who Is Teddy Villanova?, and has him being sent by a CIA-like organization to infiltrate the small country of San Sebastian to report on the movements of a rebel faction called The Sebastiani Liberation Front. Once in San Sebastian, he is confronted by a country that operates solely on credit, whose children spend all day at the movies as their sole form of education, whose public library houses only fictional encyclopedias revised at the whims of a select group of old men living upstairs, whose government has sections called The Ministry of Clams, The Ministry of Allergies, and The Ministry of Ironies likewise operated by out of touch old men, and whose King is a glutton ignorant of his own country. It's a short, amusing comedy, not up to par with Berger's other major works, but nonetheless a scathing indictment of runaway bureaucracy and outmoded forms of government."}, {"userName": "Bill FromPA", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6370216-bill-frompa", "userReview": "Previous: The FeudNext: Being Invisible"}, {"userName": "Jason Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/377051-jason-edwards", "userReview": "Although I\u2019m not a young man I only recently became privy to the essential meaning of \u201cabsurdity,\u201d to wit: that it is absurd to think anything has any meaning. Always, before, I figured absurdity for simple silliness. But now that I am a bit older than I once was (aren\u2019t we all) I am starting to see that there is, actually, no such thing as simple silliness. If silliness isn\u2019t supremely complicated, it\u2019s not silly, it\u2019s banal. Banal in the sense that, like everything else, it\u2019s just meaningless.Thus Nowhere, Berger\u2019s sequel to Who is Teddy Villanova. Not much of a sequel, really: we have the same character and same writing style, but that\u2019s about it. There\u2019s not really any kind of continuation of the prequel novel. In this sense, Nowhere stands on its own. I am telling you this in case you want to read it but don\u2019t know if you need to read Villanova first. You don\u2019t (although I would highly recommend you do read Villanova at some point; it is excellent).Nowhere is an absurd novel. And it is silly. And it is, if I may, seriously silly. This is not the silliness of random chaos, tangential wanderings, musings, whimsy. This is the well-crafted silliness of a writer dedicated to world building and, by needs, world destruction.Throughout my reading of Nowhere I found myself trying to unveil the parody, the satire, trying to decipher the hidden subject of his ridicule. But Berger thwarts all of these efforts, and continuously brings the reader back to absurdity. And in the end, he breaks a major rule of writing, and does so, I think, to put the final nail in the coffin of \u201cmeaning.\u201d I mean, it\u2019s right there in the title; I guess I didn\u2019t take him at his word until the end."}, {"userName": "Christopher Sutch", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2475981-christopher-sutch", "userReview": "I don't consider this to be one of Berger's better efforts. While the philosophical considerations of the shortcomings of the tradition of utopian fiction(s) is remarkable, it makes for pretty tedious reading (and this is a fairly short work for Berger). It definitely does not work as a novel, which it supposedly is. I was particularly disappointed because I so thoroughly enjoyed Berger's pastiche of the detective/thriller novel featuring the same protagonist as this novel, _Who Is Teddy Villanova?_. Sadly this book has about 1/10th the wit and life that that earlier work had."}, {"userName": "William Walker", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354329-william-walker", "userReview": "Fantastic dystopian novel from the always entertaining and incredibly intelligent Berger. Have a dictionary by your side. And be ready to laugh at this Swiftian tale where writers are kept in an enclosed library that no one visits and all the blondes are discriminated against until they stage a revolution that goes nowhere. Neighbors and Houseguest by Berger are even better."}], "description": "", "title": "Nowhere", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2735513.Nowhere", "average": 3.45, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348226511l/2735513.jpg", "reviews": 6, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/28517.Thomas_Berger", "name": "Thomas Berger"}], "type": ["Novels", "Fiction", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2735513-nowhere", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/987146.Nowhere", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50667.Little_Big_Man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/899109.Arthur_Rex", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/277603.Neighbors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/976050.The_Return_of_Little_Big_Man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50669.The_Feud"]}
