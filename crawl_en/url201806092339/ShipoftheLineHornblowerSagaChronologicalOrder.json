That is as Hornblower's life progresses. Here Captain Hornblower is in command of his first *ship of the line.*Note: A ship of the line was a war ship of at least 2 decks of guns. It was called a \"ship of the line\" from the tactic or strategy of running \"your\" ships in a line across the stern of the enemy thus allowing \"your\" **broadside to be fired into the rear of the enemy. **Note: A \"broadside\" means all guns on one side of the ship fired into a target.Anyway we get to watch HH grow from an insecure young man to an insecure older man. He is constantly aware of keeping up the appearance of a proper Captain in spite of his internal doubts.You will at times not like HH himself, but in the end I like these books. They will probably end up on my favorites list.Enjoy."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "[ the debacle of the taking of the Spanish fort from the French  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jamie Collins", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins", "userReview": "Re-reading the Hornblower books. I don\u2019t like this one quite as well as Beat to Quarters. It\u2019s an interesting read, and the naval stuff is fascinating, but this is terribly bleak.It begins with Hornblower desperate to get away from the wife he dislikes, grumpy because Lady Barbara got married, and depressed because he can\u2019t legally kidnap enough men to fully man the miserable ship he now commands. There\u2019s a cheerful (if bloodthirsty) section in the middle where he harasses the French along the Spanish coast, but it ends with a terrible bloodbath when Hornblower goes into battle against impossible odds.I\u2019m torn about the situation with Hornblower\u2019s wife. I understand why he married someone he doesn\u2019t love or respect, and I recognize that he does his best to keep her from finding out his feelings, but it\u2019s very unpleasant to experience his shame and dislike. I feel sorry for Maria, and I\u2019m irritated by the easy out for Hornblower that is forthcoming.Hornblower continues to childishly enjoy the air of mystery he cultivates (\u201cHe had made it a rule to offer no explanations - and there was a pleasurable selfish thrill in keeping his subordinates in ignorance of their future\u201d). He is also simultaneously envious and contemptuous of his officers and men. However, I think that we should give him (or the narrator) credit for recognizing the selfishness and the envy. Hornblower feels guilty for feeling the way he does, and is pretty sure other people don\u2019t feel the same way."}, {"userName": "Basicallyrun", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4921346-basicallyrun", "userReview": "It's good to see that the amount of bare flesh on display in the TV series is based firmly in book-canon.

One day I shall make a graph with 'Chronological Progression Through Hornblower Series' on the X-axis and 'Urge to Give Hornblower a Slap and a Damn Good Talking To About Personal Relationships' on the Y-axis.

Not talking to your junior officers at all, ever, except to give orders? On months' long sea voyages? I'm no great fan of social interaction, but that's taking it a bit far, surely?That said, when resisting the urge to give Hornblower a damn good talking to, I did enjoy the book.

This was one of the first works he read when he was growing up (along with the works of Jack London) so it has probably played a part in forming his world view.

Again and again I am awestruck at the huge accumulation of knowledge required to command a single ship effectively, and how worthless individual lives seemed to be when ships faced off against each other in combat at sea. This particular novel is an account of Hornblower's attempt to outfit the Sutherland and his eventually successful harassment of the French army marching along the Coast of the Mediterranean, pinned between the beach and the nearby mountains. Not having read the immediately previous novels, I was struck at how much less I liked Hornblower as a person even as his stature as a captain grew to superhuman proportions. Forester has done a remarkable job at sketching this latest evolution of Hornblower in continuity with his earlier years as a midshipman and lieutenant while presenting the unique challenges and concerns that continue to shape him as a sailor and a man--relative poverty, lack of seniority, hopes for advancement, an implacable and numerous enemy, doubts about his own capacities, and the secret fears of dismemberment and death which he must repress in order to command the respect of the men he leads. Each time I read these accounts of hundreds of cannon being discharged at short range into the wooden hull of ships filled with defenseless sailors, there is an aftertaste of awe and horror at the cavalier destruction of so much life. Those men who chose the life of the navy were either deeply in love with the sea, or profoundly insane; few chose it freely, impelled by necessity or the bludgeons of the press gang. Yet on those ships, which were a unique blend of village, barracks, and prison, somehow life managed to flourish--men relished the performance of their duty, knew the heady triumph of victory, and put away against the more bitter days of naval service the small pleasures of drunkenness and song. And some life it was...Ship of the Line ends with a real cliffhanger that absolutely must be followed up quickly with the next volume in the series,  Flying Colours."}, {"userName": "K.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/861629-k", "userReview": "Initial fyi: my main purpose in reviewing these books is not with adults in mind, but for the parents or adult friends of reading children.While this is full of adventure and amazing action, I am finding that so far I like the books in the series that were written later, rather than earlier. This was the 2nd Hornblower book written and it follows the precedent of \"Beat to Quarters\"...a little more violent and in my opinion Hornblower is allowed to dwell too much on his feelings for a certain someone, not his wife. The violence is completely in character with the times and the setting, if anything it's not nearly as horrible as it certainly really was (and it's really not over-the-top at all--but you definitely get the picture, and it's as all war is). I find myself often momentarily appalled during reading as I ponder the press-gang, the nightmare it would have really been to be on a fighting ship in the middle of the ocean. Shudder. On another tack, the \"relationship\" tidbits are just sort of pointless in a book like this. It could be argued that Hornblower does the honorable thing (for now)and is loyal and true to his wife (at least in the literal & physical sense) but he pines for someone else. It is perhaps an interesting situation full of grief and perplexity for an adult reader, but a kid just won't care and the social nuance & implication will go over-head. I love the leadership and the other values displayed in these books. I will reserve judgment on the others until I'm done, but so far I think this is an excellent set for older children, with either parental supervision on the ones that dwell more on the \"relationship\" factor OR skipping those books altogether until an older age."}, {"userName": "Nancy Ellis", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2492661-nancy-ellis", "userReview": "I certainly am learning more about the Napoleonic Wars than I ever knew I wanted to know!!

Understandably, Horatio is happy to set sail once again and heads to the Spanish coast where his newly organized crew manages five successful raids before biting off more than they can chew as they meet up with four French ships. The end of the book finds Horatio struggling with the option of sinking or surrender.

Forester has a penchant for getting his hero off the ship and on to dry land to fight battles (as if Sharpe suddenly took command of a ship and raced off to fight a French frigate), and in this one he gets him on to dry land to fail to fight a battle, in one of the dullest sections of the entire canon. Compensated for by two lovely (and lively) bits of action at sea. As others have warned, though, this is only half a book, with a cliffhanger ending leading straight in to Flying Colours. Once again, to anyone reading the series in chronological order of Hornblower's career, the relationship with Bush is downright bizarre.

Forester, which I just finished reading last night.[Note: Individual books have individual star ratings (mostly 5-star, a few 4-star), but the descriptive review will be the same for each, and encompass the entire series, as follows.]Actually, I just finished reading the complete series for the second time, the first being as a teenager some 30 years ago.It's remarkable to me that I have only just this moment realized that my own timeline regarding the two readings corresponds almost exactly to the age progression experienced by the main character in the course of these 11 novels.It's a 30-year journey unlike any other I have ever taken in books - full and deep and satisfying.This is the epic saga of fictional British naval hero HORATIO HORNBLOWER, who goes from a 17-year-old midshipman to a 46-year-old admiral during the \"golden age of sail\" which encompasses the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century.I'll list the 11 books in chronological order (not the order they were written), which is the best way, I believe, to read them:- MR. MIDSHIPMAN HORNBLOWER- LIEUTENANT HORNBLOWER- HORNBLOWER AND THE HOTSPUR- HORNBLOWER DURING THE CRISIS- HORNBLOWER AND THE ATROPOS- BEAT TO QUARTERS- SHIP OF THE LINE- FLYING COLOURS- COMMODORE HOWNBLOWER- LORD HORNBLOWER- ADMIRAL HORNBLOWER IN THE WEST INDIESI've read other sea-faring novels, but to me, Forester earns the crown.Why?Many reasons, but I'll list just three:1. All the rousing action you could ask for in a well-paced adventure series...2. ...coupled with a complex main character. This is the true secret of the Hornblower books - that Hornblower himself is not some one-dimensional, infallible, faultless hero. On the contrary, he is filled with self-doubt and doesn't always choose the best course, especially in personal matters. But by building the main character this way, Forester allows you to recognize, empathize, and eventually care deeply about him - rooting for his success rather than merely expecting it. It's this complex characterization that complements and actually allows for the heroics of the plot - because it all comes at a price.[One price is so high that, as a teenager, I couldn't believe that Forester had actually done it. I can't go into detail because this is a spoiler-free review, but something happens that is so devastating that literally for entire books afterwards, I kept expecting Forester to make amends. But it doesn't happen. And finally, as an older adult - knowing it will happen, knowing there will be no reprieve - I realize Forester was saying, \"This is the price of war.\"]3. The Language of Sailing Ships: I'm not nautically-minded, and there is much use of nautical language in these books. But rather than being annoyed, I had a very different reaction. First, I learned a few things. But much more importantly, I also grew to appreciate the language itself, whether I understood its technical details or not. To me, it became like poetry. Or even music.And I loved it.All 11 books.It's an investment, to be sure.But, for those \"able-bodied\", a wonderfully entertaining journey awaits.Should you set sail?Aye-aye!"}, {"userName": "Greg Deane", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12449102-greg-deane", "userReview": "\u201cShip of the Line\u201d by CS Forester is more than a swashbuckling tale of adventure in the Mediterranean. Here. Horatio Hornblower enters into command of a third rate battleship as a senior post-captain, on HMS Sutherland. The loneliness of command is now full upon him. He is willing to take his part in the Napoleonic Wars in an old, unweatherly 74-gun ship with a crew of 600 or more and a group of lieutenants each with his own problems that interfere with his ability to carry out his duties objectively, and the difficulties of outfitting and crewing a large warship. Bush, though still Horatio\u2019s loyal First Officer, is keen for promotion, outstripped as he has been by the younger Hornblower. He is eager to demonstrate his own leadership, having the crew traversing the ratlines, setting resetting sail, so the crew is faster and smarter, and he, though reduced to a one-legged old salt, will be more likely to win command of his own ship of the line. Hornblower has become gloomy in part due to his dull life with his wife, the plain, clinging Maria and her socially ambitious mother. Maria is pregnant with their \u201cthird\u201d child, though likely to die like the first two who died from smallpox. Hornblower is still haunted by the spectre of his adulterous love Lady Barbara Wellesley, the sister of the Duke of Wellington. He is the more confounded when he must entertain her with her new husband, Rear Admiral Sir Percy Gilbert Lighton, K.B., who is also Hornblower\u2019s new commanding officer. To renew his affair would add insubordination to impropriety. Despite the moral concerns that give the novel some ethical depth, it also gives insights into the tedium of naval warfare, including convoy duty where Hornblower behaves with ruthless efficiency towards East India Company ships who try to save on sail by lagging behind, out of the safer square. do not like the regimen of the Royal Navy. There is also a gale which overtakes the squadron, and the flagship Pluto is almost capsized. With typical aplomb and resourcefulness, Hornblower personally ties a thick line to drag the ship from harm, once again showing that the Royal Navy couldn't manage as well without him. But ultimately HMS Sutherland meets Four French ships of the line, which broke out of a blockade to the north. Though it would be highly improbable for any other captain, Hornblower cripples two of them, but is overwhelmed by the others, and is in a position to make an honourable surrender, the French prize being no more than a useless shell. Despite the lionisation of Hornblower, \u201cShip o the Line\u201d is a commendable book that provides insights into naval warfare in the age of tall ships, as well as the Napoleonic wars, and the formation of character of capable commanders. It is also a celebration of courage."}, {"userName": "Simon Mcleish", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish", "userReview": "Originally published on my blog here in July 1998.Re-reading A Ship of the Line is like encountering an old friend; it must be getting on for twenty years since I last read any of the Hornblower series. I was prepared for the book not to appeal, or not to match up to the other Napoleonic navy novels I've read in the meantime.I was more impressed than ever, and it has become clear why Forester set the standard that every historical naval writer has had to live up to since. He does not ignore the more unpleasant aspects of the English navy of the 1800s, as more trivial writers have done. Hornblower's world is one of poverty, deprivation, violence, ignorance, severe cruelty, seasickness and sudden death. There may be heroism and compassion, but these are not the true reality of life at sea. Hornblower is not the all-perfect action hero of writers like Farnol Jeffery 1878-1952 and Dudley Pope; he has distinct flaws which are made clear to the reader throughout the novel. And the novel itself does not end with a triumph, but with the capture of Hornblower and his ship by the French.All this raises Forester from the pack in this small genre, and means that he will continue to be read when many of the other authors are gone and forgotten."}, {"userName": "Mike Franklin", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16460451-mike-franklin", "userReview": "This book is a million miles away from my more normal preference for Science Fiction and yet I was extremely impressed by it. I came to it from my love of David Weber\u2019s Honor Harrington books which openly acknowledge their debt to Forester and Horatio Hornblower, and I was not disappointed. This was a well-paced naval adventure that has the reader cheering Hornblower on along with his crew. Okay, so the reality that such a humane and considerate naval captain could even exist in those days of flogging and pressgangs is probably pretty remote and maybe the whole business has been heavily sanitised for our twenty-first century sensibilities, but I feel this is first a stirring heroic adventure story of the high seas and only second an accurate portrayal of nineteenth century naval life at sea.A little knowledge of the nautical terms from the days of square rig sailing might have helped and I will probably put in a bit of research in this regard before going onto more of the Hornblower books. However it was not essential and its lack did not impede the extraordinary job Forester does of immersing the reader in the world of a British man-o-war in the Napoleonic wars; you can smell the salt in the air as you read, although he does overuse some, admittedly quite good, similes.All told a very good action adventure story and I shall certainly be going on to read more of the series."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/817278-jennifer", "userReview": "Based on other reviews, this might not have been the best Hornblower novel to make my first. I found the main character fascinating even in the things that made him annoying--he's astonishingly vain in the sense of ALWAYS being horrifically aware of the image he's presenting. Is he being commanding enough? Do the men respect him? Is he cutting exactly the right kind of figure? His dislike of his wife is based almost entirely on a feeling that she's not properly elegant and impressive for a captain's wife, and his mooning after Lady Barbara seems mostly based on a feeling that she would ornament his arm well. Horatio's vanity, self-doubt and introspection--almost morbid introspection--are annoying at times, but it really does save the book from being a fairly generic action adventure on the high seas. With Hornblower such an odd and complex character, the action is augmented by his personality in a way that a more traditional active character might not have done. The book gives such a vivid picture of life and combat on the high seas, it was very gripping.

But here, he crosses the line into self-absorbed whining, IMO. He doesn't feel as developed as he does in the earlier books, no doubt because this one was written second.

Captain Horatio Hornblower is newly in command of his first ship of the line, the seventy-four-gun HMS Sutherland, which he deems \"the ugliest and least desirable two-decker in the Navy List.\" Moreover, she is 250 men short of a full crew, so Hornblower must enlist and train \"poachers, bigamists, sheepstealers,\" and other landlubbers. By the time the Sutherland reaches the blockaded Catalonian coast of Spain, the crew is capable of staging five astonishing solo raids against the French. But the grisly prospect of defeat and capture looms for both captain and crew as the Sutherland single-handedly takes on four French ships.", "title": "Ship of the Line\n      \n          (Hornblower Saga: Chronological Order #7)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90951.Ship_of_the_Line", "average": 4.3, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1431694142l/90951.jpg", "reviews": 191, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/932179.C_S_Forester", "name": "C.S.
