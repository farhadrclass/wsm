I was expecting a light-hearted memoir, but instead got a moving, poignant tale of motherhood.This author has a writing style unlike anything I've read before, and it took me awhile to get used to the cadence and tone of her writing. I struggled with it at first. But once I got attuned to her style, it became a much easier read.Yes, there are moments of hilarity. But there are also many more moments of despair, love, sadness, fear, happiness, belonging. As a mother of 3 boys very near in ages to the author's children, I could completely relate to the author's feelings of frustration, hopelessness, tiredness and yet deep, unending love for her children. The shock near the end was heart-wrenching (despite the fact that it had been hinted at, and I was half-expecting it), and I had real tears falling as I read it. I was quite moved. The descriptions of the northern English countryside and way of life were also very entertaining. I love British books, but so often they are set in London, and so I had never really read about this part of the country. It was a refreshing change.If you are looking for a fluffy, light read, this is not it. But this book is so definitely worth reading - especially if you are a mother - do give it a try. :)"}, {"userName": "Kat Hagedorn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3411845-kat-hagedorn", "userReview": "http://tinyurl.com/6glw47Surprisingly, it took me quite some time to realize that this book is a collection of blog posts. I think that's because the series of posts had a definite theme that was enhanced as the diary entries continued. That theme being: why the heck have I moved away from London on the whims of my husband who isn't even here half the time and who leaves me to handle the wild countryside, loneliness and 3-kid-ring circus.O'Reilly is a clever and experienced writer, so these issues in a lesser writer's hand would have fallen flat. Sure, there are some incredibly ridiculous entries. Once you get to the 15th time she or her husband have either mislaid their car keys, run out of gas, or burst a tire, you feel that you're reading about a family of morons. As well, the juxtaposition of posts detailing extreme depression over living in Northumberland with descriptions of its utter beauty are a bit bewildering.But, anyone is certain to feel for the chaos in this woman's life and how she alternately rails at it and loves it, in equal measure. It sounds like a fairly normal life, actually. For that reason, it is sure to resonate with nigh on everyone."}, {"userName": "Joan Colby", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461746-joan-colby", "userReview": "This book turns out to be a transcription of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s blog about a London wife removed to the north of England\u2014hardly the Arctic adventure that I imagined from the title.

While she gradually grows to appreciate some of their qualities and the natural surroundings in which she has been immersed by her husband, subject of many wails about unhelpfulness (though it is apparent he must travel a lot for business, something that is supporting the cottage renovations that are being undertaken) O\u2019Reilly is given to lamenting the lack of her interesting and convenient city life.

Right. Well there is no way on God's green earth I would voluntarily pick up this book to read; but a friend gave it to me for my birthday and told me it was hysterical. Being the loyal friend / 'always up for trying something new' sort of person that I am, I gave it a go.Wife in the North is a collation of two years worth of blog posts from a professional middle class woman who moves her family from the bright bustle of London to the chilly openness of Northumberland. O'Reilly is a well educated woman who already writes for a living so I thought at least the syntax wouldn't boil my blood too much. My initial reaction to Judith O'Reilly's musings on life was hostility. Pretentious and desperate are the main two words I can call to mind on reading almost the first half of this book. Another wife and mother trying to turn their dependence on alcohol to get them through each day into something hilariously funny. Those who know me, know that this 'booze banter' that has become prevalent, primarily among woman who are mothers, does not sit comfortably with me and I nearly chucked the book in with the chickens to be covered with a liberal coating of faeces; but them something changed ....Perhaps it was O'Reilly's own changing attitude and demeanour as she struggled on through this emotional quagmire of fulfilling other people's needs while fighting her own confused feelings about her life circumstances. The tone of the blog changed. O'Reilly become more real to me and her writing became infinitely more beautiful - with vivid descriptions of her surroundings and of her relationships with her loved ones: her ageing parents, her feisty sons, her sweet baby daughter and her husband. She dug deeper into herself and came up with poignant commentaries on bullying, stillbirth and shifting roles as parents who once nurtured disintegrate into those who need nurture; and so so much more besides. O'Reilly was no longer trying so hard to make me laugh; but let some raw emotion in and her blog was much the better for it.

Sie selbst wollte dies jedoch eigentlich nie wirklich und macht es nur ihrem Mann zu liebe, der sich in ihren vielen Urlauben in Northumberland in diese Gegend verliebt hat. In Blogform erz\u00e4hlt Judith O'Reilly die ersten zwei Jahre, die sie in Northumberland verbracht haben und in denen sie entscheiden wollten, ob sie f\u00fcr immer bleiben oder nach London zur\u00fcckkehren werden. Sie selbst jedoch st\u00f6\u00dft in Northumberland auf viele Unwegsamkeiten, denn mit dem Landleben und den Leuten vom Lande kann sie eher wenig anfange. Au\u00dferdem macht ihr Heimweh und ihre Sehnsucht nach London das Einleben in Northumberland nicht leichter und wirkt sich negativ auf ihr Verhalten aus. Zu alldem kommt noch dazu, dass ihr Mann, der unbedingt nach Northumberland wollte, die meiste Zeit zwecks seines Jobs in London ist und sie allein mit ihren drei kleinen Kinder k\u00e4mpfen muss.Meinung: Ich gebe zu, dass ich von dem Buch nicht erwartet hatte, dass es in Blog-Eintragsform geschrieben ist. Im Allgemeinen ist das jedoch kein Grund, dass ein Buch schlechter ist als ein anderes, denn es gibt dem Buch halt einfach einen anderen Stil. Jedoch war es bei diesem Buch so, dass in vielen der Eintr\u00e4ge eigentlich gar nicht wirklich etwas erz\u00e4hlt wurde, so dass ich mich erhlich ziemlich oft gefragt habe, was die Autorin einem damit wohl \u00fcberhaupt sagen wollte. In den restlichen Eintr\u00e4gen vermittelte sie einem ansonsten entweder, dass sie strohdoof ist oder so tut, als sei sie es oder sie jammert einfach nur rum. Auf Dauer ist sowohl das Gejammer, als auch ihre vorhanden Dummheit ziemlich nervig, so dass es mir ehrlich schwer viel das Buch bis zum Ende zu lesen, denn es passiert in ihrem Leben nun auch nicht grade wirklich etwas erz\u00e4hlenswertes. Auch sind die meisten Dinge die sie erz\u00e4hlt eher langweilig und selbst Vorkommnisse, die lustig sein k\u00f6nnten, werden von ihr so erz\u00e4hlt, dass sie nicht mehr so wirken.Alles in allem muss ich sagen, dass ich von dem Buch ziemlich entt\u00e4uscht bin und der Verlag der Autorin lieber h\u00e4tte empfehlen sollen den Blog als diesen zu belassen und lieber kein Buch draus zu machen."}, {"userName": "Kathy (Bermudaonion)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1454470-kathy-bermudaonion", "userReview": "Judith O\u2019Reilly and her husband and children were living in London. Her husband has always dreamed of living in the country, so they move three and a half hours away to Northumberland. Judith agreed to a two year trial period and Wife in The North is her diary of that period.At the beginning of the book, I found myself wondering why he wanted to move to the country when he still worked in London, and Judith ended up living as a single mother during the week. As the book progressed, I wondered why she agreed to the move when she loved London so much. Judith came across as very negative to me - she ran out of gas five times and always blamed her husband, even though he was in London. She was overwhelmed by her children, even though she had a \u201cGirl Friday\u201d come in to help her.This book was just okay for me. There was really no plot and little character development - none of the characters had names beyond things like the \u201cLondon Diva\u201d and \u201cthe four-year-old\u201d.

I particularly enjoyed her writing style, but at the same time, it's obviously a collection of blog posts that were combined to create a book. It took awhile to get through and at the end, I was left to wonder if I would have enjoyed reading the author's blog more. When something is published, I expect it to have more meaning, and while well-written, I don't quite know the point of O'Reilly's story.

In general, I don't have a lot of patience with big city types who rag on country living, and this was no exception. HOWEVER, if my husband moved me from my beloved London to a backwater and then spent all *his* time in London himself for work - abandoning me in a place I hated - that would be grounds for immediate divorce, or being shot behind the woodshed.

Anecdotes that I might find funny, quirky and insightful in a day-to-day or weekly format don't seem to translate well into books. I find they often come off as too self-absorbed (how could they not?), too whiny and just plain trying too hard to pull a story out of an everyday, non-linear life. What works in small doses becomes hard to swallow in a tome.[return][return]After reading about a third of Wife in the North, I'd resigned myself to the same experience with this book. It seemed like it was going to be a combination of two themes: first, \"long suffering wife gives up high power, glamorous career to raise children while husband keeps his career\"; and second, \"city girl unwillingly uproots herself to the country and through her own determination and fortitude, learns to appreciate the charms of its bumpkin people and character\".[return][return]Of course, the book does cover that ground, as the author, her husband and three children move from London to the far northern English countryside of Northumberland. Having lived in England for two years, I concur that the two places are worlds apart culturally. O'Reilly's chronicles of her angst and foibles trying to craft a new life for herself and her family in a rural setting are funny without being condescending toward her new neighbors and village folk. [return][return]What really surprised me about the book, however, and why I gave it four stars, was O'Reilly's ability to capture the emotional highs and extreme lows of motherhood, and the fierce, unrelenting love of a mother for her children. As we learn more about her, she reveals a depth that I didn't expect based on the beginning of the book. Her writing is sumptuous -- in turns hilarious and heart-wrenching, and very, very accurate when it comes to describing the complexity of everyday life and the precarious balancing act required to keep self, marriage and children intact when much of the time, one or another (or all) are teetering on the brink.[return][return]O'Reilly has a talent for bringing forth emotion in small moments through descriptive passages, such as the one recounting her relationship with the view of the lighthouse from her bedroom window and another when she notices the birdsong heralding the onset of spring. I cried a face full of tears at the end over an unexpected revelation (I won't hint, so as not to create a spoiler). After that, I understood her story and felt like I'd bonded with her at last.

The journal format works really successfully in this book, turning her memoir into a bunch of little stories and memories. Throughout the whole book, the author longs for London and I can definitely understand that. I am a city person one million times over, I don't know how I would fare in the country. There is a great passage where the author encounters a double decker bus in the country and hopes it will take her back to London. I think she is only half joking! The author also has a great sense of humor that is seen throughout the book in every type of situation! One of my favorite examples is where she leaves a note for her husband when she leaves for a trip. Talking about if her oldest son gets something, the younger son will want one too and that's it's best to get the baby one as well so she doesn't feel left out. I just love her sense of everyday humor. Another great example is the difference between a haircut in the country and one in London. The country haircut takes much much less time, why is that? The author has a great explanation for why that might be! A lot of my favorite entries are the interactions between the author and her three children, lots of cute things the kids say and do. I also really felt for her while her son is being bullied at school and it will not stop. She wants her son to enjoy school but that's very hard when he gets knocked about all the time. You can definitely feel her pain and unhappiness during this time. Who doesn't want their children to be happy and enjoy school? My only two hang-ups with the book were the fact that her husband made the family move from their beloved London but he got to spend a lot of his time there in London for work. Talk about unfair! It kind of seems if the family stayed in London and saw him when he was working and he stayed in Northumberland when he wasn't working they would have seen him more often! The other was the fact that she couldn't get her own gas and expected her husband to get it for her and ran out of it often. I see wanting to let her husband get it for her I guess, but after running out multiple times I think maybe she should have started getting it herself, it got a bit old after awhile. I was pretty much over these two things about halfway through the book though. Overall this was a very delightful book about family and adjusting to a new environment!"}, {"userName": "Donura", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/544388-donura", "userReview": "DATE:\t\t\tAugust 8, 2008TITLE:\t\tWife in the NorthAUTHOR:\t\tO\u2019Reilly, Judith PUBLISHER:\t\tPublic AffairsCOPYRIGHT:\t2008RATING:\t\t4.5 of 5The subtitle of this book is three young children, two aging parents, and one absentee husband 350 miles from home, but it should end with \u2018one very funny woman\u2019.As I started reading this book, I got out my little sticky tabs because there were so many funny, sarcastic sometimes but very funny, comments. After a while the edge of my book looked like it had been sprinkled with a heavy dose of confetti. The honest feelings, sometimes bordering on blatant, that Ms. O\u2019Reilly uses to describe her life as it unfolds during her transplant from London to Northumberland can resonate with many women. Every time you think she has run out of expressions or comparisons up pops another one. Her definition of a \u201chealth visitor\u201d and then soon to follow the description of her body in a surfing wet suit had me practically rolling on the floor. However, the book has a touching side to it as well. There were times when I wanted to pick up the phone and call her husband and tell him that he would later regret it if he did not go home and help his wife with their children during such a trying time and for Gosh sakes, at least pump the petrol. For someone who wanted to have his family raised in such a rural location, he was spending way too much time in London. But when I came to the August 4, 2007 entry, and she described what the loss of child meant for her new friend, The Yorkshire Mother, I was very surprised that she was able to see it so clearly. I lost my only son and I have only found a kinship in that pain with other women that have lost a child. No matter what anyone says, it is loss very different from the loss of a parent, spouse, or sibling. And so it is.I recommend this book to anyone who needs to appreciate their present station in life, anyone who wants to laugh their way through a book for a change, and to let them know that the best part is once you finish the book, you can continue the story by visiting her blog, www.wifeinthenorth.com. I have waited until I finished the book to make my first visit, so I would not read any spoilers. :>)"}, {"userName": "Susanne Pichler", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5911917-susanne-pichler", "userReview": "Judith O'Reilly liebt London von ganzem Herzen.

A devoted city girl, O'Reilly is married to a Northumberland man who dreamed of going back, so she decideded to grant his wish; she agreed to move to the north for two years. But for O'Reilly life in the north is hardly a dream. She misses her London life, lacks close friends in her new home, and finds that everything, from her neighbors's dress to local pastimes is a world apart from what she knew in London. Culture-shocked, O'Reilly begins writing a blog about her experiences. This book is comprised of the blog entries. I'd never read a book comprised of blog entries before, but I found that the format worked surprisingly well. It's more like jumping into the middle of someone else's life than just about any other could be. I very much enjoyed reading this. O'Reilly is humorous, and she's willing to bare her soul on her blog. Her story is interesting, and I couldn't wait to get to the end to see what they would decide to do at the end of two years (she won't tell you until the epilogue!) In the interest of full disclosure I should mention that I, too, have recently move from a more urban and populated area to one very different, so I had a great deal of sympathy for O'Reilly's plight. Ultimately, this book combines some of the best features of the memoir and the travel narrative, as O'Reilly clearly approaches Northumberland as an outsider, and it's interesting to see how she interprets her experience through the lens of place. The book offers an intimate picture of a family and a marriage, and shows the ways in which people define home. When I got to the epilogue the final decision was what I had anticipated, and it's interesting that O'Reilly's words illustrate the direction the family is headed, even if she could not see so at the time she was writing the blog.

She has two children when she arrives in the country; a third arrives shortly after she does. Her husband, however, still works in London, so he is often away from home and Judith has to learn how to be the mum of three and a country girl, all on her own.The book is initially written as a journal, but about halfway through, Judith starts a blog and the entries are then posts to her blog. I really loved reading this format \u2013 perhaps because I am an active blogger myself; it\u2019s such an interactive way of getting to know someone. Her stories of parenting resonated so clearly and she certainly has wonderfully biting British wit. Certain stories and phrases had me laughing out loud; her life was so full of misadventures, even funnier because they aren\u2019t fiction. Other posts were so poignant, she worries and stresses about many of the same things that I do, only she does a much better job of putting these fears into words.Sometimes I felt she was a bit too down on her husband, but the transition to Northumberland was, quite obviously, a terrifically challenging one for her and I could understand her frustration. All in all, it was a pleasure to read. I especially loved reading about her tender love of her children, her fiercely protective nature (played out in blog posts about some incidents at her son\u2019s school) and her joy in the moments that put mothering truly into perspective.

The book is about Judith, who has three children and loves London life, and who hates that her husband has decided to move them all to Northumberland even though he still does the majority of his work in London. Judith really struggles with the move to the country whilst fighting post natal depression. A lot of the book I just wanted her to tell her husband to stop being so bloody selfish. I also struggled to understand the format of the book. It is set diary style where you are told what each day is but it's not a diary. Judith starts a blog later on and it seems that each day's entry could be her blog entries but then what were the bits before her blog started? The story is played out over two and a half years and although Judith is starting to come round to the country in the end, most of the book is just her struggling. You find out need the end of the book that Judith's first child died and that is really sad and helped me warm to the character and understand her a bit better.

At times I found myself wondering \"What does she actually do then if it's that bad?\" As I said previously she has a good sense of humour and actually when you consider that she has 3 young children, 2 elderly parents and the grief of a stillbirth to contend with I think she did well to adjust to the move. I wanted to like this book more but I do think that if I hadn't read her other book beforehand I would have given up on this one long before the end. I kept thinking \"It will really pick up soon and be more like her later book\" but it never really did. I can only suppose that by the time she wrote the later book she was slightly less stressed and better adjusted to her surroundings and therefore her personality and sense of humour shone through a lot more."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "Wife in the North is Judith O\u2019Reilly\u2019s journey. Come along as Judith and her children are taken hostage to the North-Eastern part of England, especially Northumberland. Ok, so maybe Judith wasn\u2019t really taken hostage for real but it felt like it to her. Who in their right mind would want to move from the city of London to the North? The answer is no one, that\u2019s exactly what Judith is going to blame it on when she agreed to move\u2026her mind. She blames it on her hormones due to the fact that she was pregnant with her and her husband\u2019s third child. Now Judith has to learn to adapt to farm life, mud, horses, and worst of all no friends. This has got to be one of the funniest books I have enjoyed reading in a long time. The way Mrs. O\u2019Reilly would describe things and events that took place were priceless. Each situation in the book had a title. These titles were one of the things that made this book so much fun. Another fact was Mrs. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s children, especially her five-year old. Oh if the world could always see things through a five-year old\u2019s eyes, out problems would seem so much simpler. I felt like I got to know The O\u2019Reilly family and I fell in love with them. For anyone who wants to escape their dull, boring lives then you have got to read Wife in the North. You won\u2019t be sorry you did."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1195063-lisa", "userReview": "Loved her style of writing, her dry sense of humor, her amazing descriptions...But throughout the book, I just keep thinking \"why is she doing this?\" Don't get me wrong--I'm all for adventure. I even understand crazy adventures for which no one else can fathom your reasons...quitting university to work as a deckhand on a fishing boat, jumping off suspended pipelines, cross-country skiing into frozen landscapes to live for days at a time. I even understand taking on adventures at the request of others--ASSUMING that they're going to be in it with you. Judith O'Reilly's premise made sense to me--try something unfathomable to test yourself AND because you love the person asking it of you. But then to see her so miserable, to not hear much redeeming about the experience until the very last pages, to know she never even wanted to do it in the first place AND THEN to not even have her husband join her when it was his idea? Well, hello? At what point do you simply stick up for yourself and say, \"Yes, I understand the need to be more present in my kids life, and I will give up my career, but if you're keeping yours then we'll do this on my terms.\" Guess I'm more selfish than her!...That being said, hats off to anyone willing to sacrafice for a spouse and family!"}, {"userName": "Katy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279004-katy", "userReview": "I Started reading the Wife in the North blog almost 2 years ago. I loved following her stories and relections. When she annonced that she had a book deal I was very excited for her.Now that I read it... I have to say I am some what disappointed. I gave it 3 stares because at its core, there is a lot of good writing in the book. There are a lot of stories here that I would go back to in a minute, that make for great relection and conversation. But like someone else said, not a lot happens. This is a blog, not a book. I think the answer to the question, \"does a good blog make a good book?\" is NO. However, I don't think that means that Judith O'Reilly isn't a great writer. I think she has the potential to be a marvolous author, I just don't think this book, her book tells a story. Maybe if she had a collections of short stories rather than a collection of blog entires it would make for an easier read. She has great charaters, a great primous, but she needs a story, not antidotes.Sorry Wifey. I know your heart and soul went into this, but it just missed the mark for me. I can't see myself making it a must read for anyone. I will however keep it and refer back to certain stories quiet often."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1485064-linda", "userReview": "In 2005, journalist Judith O'Reilly agrees to move to the north of England with her husband and three young children to sample life in the country. Judith loves London, is a successful journalist and has many friends. Not only is living in the country like being a fish out of water for her, her husband's job takes him frequently back to London for days and weeks at a time, leaving her alone to cope with this strange new life.O'Reilly brilliantly captures the experience and her reaction to it with exquisite imagery. Every woman will identify with her frustration, confusion, anger, sadness and, yes, happiness as they experience the adventure right along with her. At times I laughed out loud and sometimes, I cried or was angry. The book is written in a diary or memo format, so at times, it was difficult to follow. Also, if you aren't British, it is a little confusing figuring our what she's talking about when she uses British phrases. These drawbacks do not take away from the pleasure of immersing yourself in this adventure. Strongly recommended."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/795517-wendy", "userReview": "I think this is the first book that I have read that is in the blog-to-book format. I think that Judith O'Reilly is a very talented writer. I like her voice and her narrative style. Despite this, I felt like her blog and her writing talent provided what could have been great raw materials for a really nice memoir and I think I would have liked this book far more if she had expanded on her blog to create a more personal memoir. It was of course very clear that she was not thrilled with moving to Northumberland and that she missed London terribly, but she seemed to do a great deal of moaning and groaning about her life in the country that really didn't seem all that awful. I mean, she got to be home with her children, she had help during the day so seems like she should have had a fair amount of time to herself, she got to build a beautiful home and she did seem to make quite a few friends. Not such a bad life, really. All in all though, it was still a fairly enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Alison (Ali of Worducopia)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/951556-alison-ali-of-worducopia", "userReview": "A blog in book form, chronicling the adventures of a woman who agrees to an experiment her husband proposes, leaving London for the northern English countryside. O'Reilly comes across as a personable woman, a loving mother and wife, a good friend. None of the other characters came alive for me, though--perhaps because none of them had names. I understand protecting anonymity in a memoir; that's what pseudonyms are for. I had no mental image of \"the four-year-old,\" no way to distinguish \"the Patient Mother\" from \"the London Diva,\" and so on. Reilly is a talented blogger. If you're looking for sometimes funny, often thought-provoking mini-essays from a fish-out-of-water in the north of England, this is an enjoyable read. If you're hoping for a story arc, character development and growth, a plot that's stitched together in a meaningful way--this isn't it. For better or for worse, this is real life, blogged as it happened, then printed out almost verbatim, and bound."}, {"userName": "Chrisiant", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/291423-chrisiant", "userReview": "This book was not for me. I am already predisposed against the journal-of-a-year-of-experience-by-woman-trying-to-find-meaning genre, but it seemed like this one might not wholly fit that mold. I made it about 65 pages of whining about how she didn't want to move to the north of England but her husband did and there were practical reasons why they did before I gave up. I flipped through the rest of the book to see if the whining petered out, but it was just as complain-y at the end as it was at the beginning. Look lady, if your husband's desire to live in the country is so damn taxing on you, you could say no. I'm sure it was taxing having two small children and being very pregnant while your husband travelled for work and you set up house in a new place far away from your community. And also, there was not a single thing interesting or accessible in reading about your experience.

Her husband continues to work in the city, while Judith stays home with the kids. She had a career going before she had the children, and now staying home with them is wearing on her. I found this book moving and funny. I like Judith's style of writing. The book is written like a diary. With entry titles like 'Just one of those days', 'Sex and chocolate cake' and 'Womb with a view' how could you not want to read it? She made me laugh out loud during certain parts, and get teary eyed during others.

It wasn't. I have to be honest and say while some of the episodes were a little amusing I didn't howl with laughter - unlike the quote on the front. Judith O'Reilly writes well and her style is very accesible but I just kept getting infuriated - not with her, but with her damn husband and some of her London friends. I found the book annoyed me so I only read it in small doses - I wasn't going to finish it but felt I wanted to see what decision they made. I was brought up short by one heartbreakingly sad story - I won't go into details here - and that made me feel great sympathy for them.

Ex-journalist loves London which is where her husband has to be much of the time, commuting to work while she wrangles a newborn, ailing parents, home renovators, sick kids, boisterous kids, sweet kids, bullied kids. Anyone who has survived life with small children will howl with laughter.

In the rugged landscape of Northumberland County, O'Reilly swapped her high heels for rubber boots and life-long friends for cows, sheep, and strange neighbors.In this tremendously funny and acutely observed memoir, O'Reilly must navigate the challenges and rewards of motherhood, marriage, and family as she searches for her own true north in an alien landscape. Her intrepid foray into the unknown is at once a hilarious, fish-out-of-water story and a poignant reflection on the modern woman's dilemma of striking the right balance between career and family.", "title": "Wife in the North", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3520380-wife-in-the-north", "average": 3.23, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328759413l/3520380.jpg", "reviews": 74, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1487207.Judith_O_Reilly", "name": "Judith O'Reilly"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Womens Fiction", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3520380-wife-in-the-north", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6798283-stadt-land---schluss", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3707665-wife-in-the-north", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17119947-a-year-of-doing-good", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36208185-killing-state", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839208-killing-state"]}
