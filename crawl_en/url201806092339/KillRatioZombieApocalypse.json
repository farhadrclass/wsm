Caused by a virus spreading exponentially through the population, it looks like there's no end in sight. Chad Halverson, however, is going to do his best to make it out alive. See, he knows exactly how this all started, and the government--his own co-workers, in fact--want him dead for that knowledge. Meanwhile, the President and his council are holed up in Mount Weather, ready to make some chilling decisions that will affect the entire world. Who will win, who will lose, and will we ever be the same again?I thought this was a captivating book. The characters are intriguing; the story is one that could eventually happen, what in this day of germ warfare and other craziness; and the general tone of the book is depressing but hopeful at the same time. Jumping back and forth between Chad's group and those at Mount Weather was a very neat concept, as you could see what was REALLY going on in the world versus what the government fat-cats could see and were debating about. That group in itself was great; I felt like that's exactly what would happen in a situation like this, and the ongoing tension and escalating tempers were just perfect.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good zombie story, but also for those who want to know just what the government would do in this situation. I believe it's depicted quite accurately; will you?4 starsP.S. I may have shortened my boyfriend's life by showing him the cover upon first waking up. =)"}, {"userName": "Space Out With Sci Fi in June The Haunted Reading Room", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7302570-space-out-with-sci-fi-in-june-the-haunted-reading-room", "userReview": "Review: KILL RATIO by Bryan CassidayKILL RATIO is part of the Chad Halvorsen series, set in the Zombie apocalypse. Halvorsen is a former operative for the US government, now a target for termination since a fellow black ops agent gave Halvorsen information on the factual source of the virus behind the Zombie infection. After narrowly escaping a predator drone attack, he and temporary sidekick Victoria begin to cross-country from Southern California toward D.C. I'm not quite sure how to consider Halvorsen. The man is a trained and efficient field agent, knows weapons, presumably knows how to strategize; but I've seldom seen anyone so indecisive. The other aspect I take away from this book is that the author wisely expands the apocalyptic circumstances: instead of just shuffling, biting, undead, there is socio-economic collapse, looters and murderers, wildfires and urban devastation, starving dog packs, starving rat hordes, and folks with identifiable mental and emotional disorders, possibly caused by the plague and subsequent apocalypse, possibly preexistent. Then there's my favourite character group, those cynical, shortsighted fools exile in underground Virginia--hilarious if they weren't so pathetic.The author generously provided me with a digital copy for review purpose."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7143386-daniel", "userReview": "The world is coming to an end, thanks to a plague turning people into zombies. The American government is to blame and one man aims to hold them accountable. Chad Halverson , a CIA Black Ops agent, knows the truth and now his employer has sent a drone to kill him. Can Chad and his gang survive the onslaught of dead and make it to Washington, DC?The fourth installment of the Chad Halverson series is suspenseful, engaging, and action packed. At the core it\u2019s a zombie tale and \u201cKill Ration\u201d doesn\u2019t disappoint in this area.While reading, I kept visualizing it as a big action/horror flick with blood, guts, and explosions. A few characters I felt were a bit clich\u00e9(most noticeably The President), but it went with the vibe I was getting of an over the top action flick.I have not read any of the other books in the series and I never felt lost.

This book starts off in an action packed, zombie infested America. What is interesting about this book, as opposed to others I've read recently, is that not all of the American people are yet aware of the devastation that is spreading throughout America. The author creates a unique and interesting plot by taking the reader back and forth from the action in zombie infested parts of America, to the difficult decisions being made in the government. The main character, Halverson, is traveling through zombie infested areas, picking up traveling companions as he goes. Halverson was a difficult character for me to connect with. I couldn't understand his desire to \"save the world\" while the government was trying to kill him. His patriotism, I guess, was hard to understand. Especially when seeing the corruption and decisions being made by the government. On the plus side, the author did a great job of illustrating decision making and governmental powers. The collection of people making decisions voiced realistic concerns, options, and consequences. Dialogue and situation were well written concerning governmental affairs. Also, the book is well written. The author writes in a style and diction I found appealing."}, {"userName": "Richard Rivers", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47899666-richard-rivers", "userReview": "***Audio Book Review***Sigh, four books into the series and 3 different narrators. This one isn't as bad as the first two, but falls well short of the third and the third was only mediocre. Plot. OMG. Is this series really a preteen and I didn't know it? Let me split this plot into two parts. The government is searching for the former CIA operative and this part of the story is a bit thin but is believable in this zombie story. I can follow along without much of a stretch. Our CIA guy takes his group to Las Vegas and meets the leader of the city who has a very special way of controlling the horde.Through out the book the writer explains over and over that the zombies only want to eat. They don't think, they just eat. Without giving away a spoiler, the plot is so stupid. It is a touch better than the plot of the last book, but it is still terrible. The writer has a good imagination but fails to use it to create a believable situation."}, {"userName": "Hayley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454041-hayley", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange for a review. Basic Summary: Zombie apocalypse with some politics and conspiracy thrown in.I was slightly disappointed by Kill Ratio, because it fell short of what I expected. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the writing style. Some of the sentences felt awkward or repetitive, and a few things were fairly predictable.

Some of the scenes were beyond gruesome, but I really enjoyed the descriptiveness of the author. I got a clear picture of the scenery and characters. I really enjoyed the collapse being so vividly described. The naughty government is not a new direction, but getting to know what they were up to throughout the story was a cool approach.
