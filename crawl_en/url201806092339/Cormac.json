I have two dogs of my own, who I adore, and who more times than not, I organize my life around...so any book with a picture of a dog on the cover has my interest instantly. That said, \"Cormac\" was an okay read, but didn't come close to measuring up to the hopes I had for it.The story is about a man and his dog. Sonny Brewer is in the midst of releasing his first novel, and touring the country to publicize it. One night, while he's thousands of miles from home, he gets a phone call from his close friend (and dog sitter) which puts into play any dog owner's worst nightmare. Cormac is missing. During a thundershower that lasted a matter of mere minutes, Cormac took off.Brewer spends the next three weeks searching for his dog, never giving up home that the two will be reunited. Without giving anything away, Cormac had been picked up by a Golden Retriever rescue program and processed into their system. While Cormac was not at home with his family, rest assured he was at least being taken very good care of.I read a review written by another reader on amazon.com. I seriously don't think this woman read the same book I did. Its hard for me to properly discuss my disagreements with her review, without pretty much spoiling the entire story for those of you who might want to read it. Basically, in her review she states that she works for a Golden Retriever rescue, and was insulted by this book and how they referred to others like her as over zealous. She then went on to accuse the author of neglecting his dog, and pretty much not ever caring about him to begin with. Now, while this isn't the most interesting or entertaining book I've ever read, one thing is made crystal clear through the author's words: the man adores his dog. How she can even call that notion into question is beyond me...like I said, I don't think she read the same book I did.The end of the story, where we learn all the facts, and all the pieces behind Cormac's disappearance start to fit together, horrified me. I began questioning the humanity in the world...its sad.If you're a dog lover, read this book...when you're done, read the review on amazon and send that reviewer your thoughts.."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3168915-katherine", "userReview": "I felt that this book could have been much better. In the beginning, I really liked the author's writing style, but as I progressed, I didn't like it so much. I can't put my finger on it, but I felt that he was a tiny bit condescending, for lack of a better word. As a dog lover, I was mortified that he would take down perfectly good and SAFE fencing, and put a radio control shock collar on his dog at a time when he was not going to be able to monitor him (this was while he was home, but fully engrossed in writing his novel). Naturally, the dog checked the boundaries, and not surprisingly, leapt through them. The author's answer to this was to get a stronger collar, rather than put up an actual fence. The second thing that I thought was really stupid of him was to not put a microchip in his dog at the very first opportunity. He certainly would have found Cormac a lot sooner had he done that. One more thing that was kind of irresponsible of the author was to keep his dog intact. He had no intention of showing or breeding Cormac, and so should have had him neutered. And, unless he did it and then didn't clarify it, he declined to have Cormac registered with the AKC, when all the paperwork was there when he bought the puppy.There were a few things that just made me cringe and think, \"No wonder the dog is lost!\". The author never went to the shelter in person to look for the dog! I don't get that! Phone calls are not enough when you are looking for a missing pet. You have to go to the shelter! Even if they tell you that your dog is not there! People on the desks and phones at shelters are often very busy, and it is not their job to look for your pet.All that being said, I didn't hate the book. I liked it ok, and that is what the two stars represent. Not a great book, but still a dog book, and I did read it through to make sure Cormac made it home. I hope Sonny Brewer built a fence for beautiful Cormac!"}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/948988-anna", "userReview": "I got send Cormac to review for Book Divas. When I first saw the summary, I was like, wow. This is going to be an amazing book. It didn't really live up to my expectations, though. First, it had a really slow start. I almost never give up on reading a book, but I got to page fifty of this one, and I was close to putting it down. If it hadn't picked up for a little bit there, I would've put it down.Not only did it start off slow, but the pace would pick up and then drop way down like the beginning, then pick up, etc. The events weren't really.. scattered well throughout the book.I didn't really enjoy the author's style of writing, either. It was just so... boring. You know how people like to use lots of descriptive words in one sentence? Yeah, I found that happening a lot in this novel, and that annoys me to no end. That was one thing that annoyed me about the author's style, but I guess his style just wasn't my type of thing.The story was cute though. I couldn't even imagine losing either one of my two yellow labs. It's definitely easy to relate to the feelings in the novel because of this. If you're any kind of animal lover, dog lover in particular, you'll be able to relate to this book. You'll know the feelings being portrayed by the author. The story about how he got his dog home was really interesting as well. I never thought that it would take that much just for one little dog! So much happened to him in just a few days!"}, {"userName": "AGamble", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/988767-agamble", "userReview": "A good story and a quick read, though it takes a little bit to begin the action. Heartwarming, very honest, while not tear-jerking, emotionally rousing. However, I would caution dog owners to not use electric fences. They don't work, they're expensive, and (most importantly) they've harmful to your dog.Growing up, I had a Golden Retriever named Maggie. She was, like Cormac, afraid of thunderstorms and, again like Cormac, adept at escaping. Thankfully, we were able to find her every time, and for the majority of her life I was too young or self-absorbed to truly worry about what would happen if she disappeared forever. (I've since learned this lesson; Maggie died when I was sixteen and she was about fourteen. I still pine for her, though I have a dog whom I love very much.) Today, I'm convinced that every dog (or cat, for that matter) should be micro-chipped. People like Ruth Baxter exist, and people are incompetent in every workplace, and not many of us have the time or resources Brewer did to recover our pets when they disappear. The simple, relatively inexpensive procedure of microchipping is well worth the peace of mind it brings. That said, I'm still terrified of my dog, Otis, disappearing one day, and I can only hope my loved ones and community would behave as helpfully as Sonny Brewer's did."}, {"userName": "Chelsey Mbf", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35534155-chelsey-mbf", "userReview": "I wasn't able to finish it. I'm sure it's a very heart warming tale, but it really didn't pull me in and get me hooked soon enough. What I did read was thoughtful, well written and heartfelt. I just didn't find it was something I could get into enough that I'd hold on to the end. I read The Biography Of A Stray (a short paperback) in middle school and loved it. I was expecting it to be like that, but it wasn't, really. That's not to say it isn't a good book, it just wasn't a fitting read for my preferences (I like sci fi perhaps too much) It describes it to be like Marley and me; I didn't like Marley and me (as I found it boring and I nearly fell asleep watching it) so that may explain it. It is definitely a good read though (for those who love animal books) and much better than Marley and me (with much more narrative, too!)"}, {"userName": "Kattie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929254-kattie", "userReview": "My recommendation is that if you read this book, do not do so by audiobook.The author reads this book as if he's never seen the material before, and he's been asked to read it in front of the class.Despite the fact that the subtitle of this book is \"A Dog Gone Missing\", only a third of the book at the most is of the dog being missing. And that was the most interesting part of the book. I love and adore my dog, especially since he is the closest thing I have to a child in my life, but I don't need to hear two and a half hours of someone else's love to understand it. It gets old.The return of the dog did make me want to run home and hug my puppy and see him smile.

His childhood and his dog then, the dog he had before Cormac and the arrival of the golden retriever pup. The second half of the book is the search for Cormac when he goes missing. While there is some of the anguish a pet owner feels when a pet is lost, there is also details of the search and the surprising travels of the dog. It gives pet owners another consideration if they are ever in this position.The author is widely acclaimed although I thought the literary merit wasn\u2019t that great. As a dog lover I was not swept up into the story until the very end."}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/910712-k", "userReview": "While the author Sonny Brewer is on a book tour his beloved golden retriever Cormac disappears from his home during a thunderstorm. The story is about Sonny's first getting Cormac and the subsequent search for the dog. While at first the book just moved along it was the middle and near the end when it picked up as one tried to figure out the \"motives\" and characters actions that dealt with Cormac. I listened to it on Playway and the author read his book.

One he gave away because he just could not handle the fact that is was being a dog I guess he wanted the dog to change its habits and take the time to train the dog. Then he gets Cormac. Cormac runs off and Sonny tells his story about trying to find him. Good story but Sonny's demeanor is a turn off so that is why the two stars. Get in the car and drive to the pounds to look for the dog not just make a call, mistakes and misidentifications and cruel people happen. Oh yes and if you know the dog can get passed the electric fence, do something."}, {"userName": "Sharlene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2188170-sharlene", "userReview": "Having recently lost (and found) a cat who went missing for 21 days, I can relate to the anguish the author felt when his dog, Cormac went missing.

So begins a strange adventure that lands Cormac in the back of a red pickup truck driven by a mysterious woman, takes him to a series of dog pounds and rescue shelters, and ultimately brings him to the suburbs of Connecticut. His owner, meanwhile, devastated by Cormac\u2019s disappearance and trying to juggle a family, a book tour, and writing his new novel, becomes determined to solve the \u201cdog-napping\u201d case. With the help of the local veterinarian, bookstore colleagues, animal rescue employees, and old friends, he picks up on Cormac\u2019s trail and watches his small-town community come together in search of his lost companion.Inspired by real events, and embellished only to serve the story through the spirit of imagination, Brewer has, as he says, \u201cmainly told the truth in this story of losing my good dog Cormac.\u201d", "title": "Cormac", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2259794.Cormac", "average": 3.41, "cover": "", "reviews": 41, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/430.Sonny_Brewer", "name": "Sonny Brewer"}], "type": ["Animals", "Animals", "Nonfiction", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2259794.Cormac", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1372142.Cormac", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2284675.Cormac", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7191098-cormac", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7406959-cormac", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2284676.Cormac", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12417.The_Poet_of_Tolstoy_Park", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6845623-the-widow-and-the-tree", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9250969-don-t-quit-your-day-job", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26749.A_Sound_Like_Thunder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1013527.Stories_from_the_Blue_Moon_Cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
