Hating? I'm LOVING it!\"\"What is it about? Not about psychopaths killing off siblings and cousins before adolescence I hope?\"\"Well, good question. Not much happens actually, and that is the whole charm of the novel. It's about people talking.\"\"What are they talking about?\"\"Whatever suits them at the moment. The plot consists of a long dialogue between different characters staying at a big mansion in Ireland during World War Two, and they talk, and talk and talk. Ladies talk, servants talk, children talk. The stories shift and change, and quite often, two people talk to each other about different things, much to the delight of the reader, who can catch up on two threads simultaneously.\"\"Sounds confusing!\"\"But it's not. The author is a genius observer. He manages to show what his characters are at by making them frown, laugh, or blush, or lie or tell the truth, all according to their current state of mind.\"\"Is there a main theme?\"\"I suppose it is LOVING. After all, the title indicates it. The cook (don't call her that, it makes her mad!) loves her little Albert, and the big Albert loves Edith, who loves Mr Raunce alias Charley, formerly known as Arthur. Kate doesn't really love Paddy, but she feels lonely. And Mrs Jack, the younger Mrs Tennant, adores her secret lover, while her husband seems to love to go fishing. They all love talking and gossip and a bit of excitement!\"\"Sounds like you love them!\"\"Oh, I do! How could I not! It is just adorable to be part of the gossip, to live among them and to listen behind the door, smiling at the turns the same old story takes depending on who tells it to whom.\"\"What was the best thing about it?\"\"I couldn't tell, I read it during one long sitting, taking in the dialogues without break. But maybe the bedroom scene, relived (or maybe I should rather say reTALKED) from all possible angles? Or the mystery of the lost ring, unfolding like a round of Cluedo, except that all protagonists seem to talk about a different game, or to remix the cards during the session?\"\"So you admit that not all new authors you try out are rubbish?\"\"I never said that!\"\"I thought I heard...\"\"That's what happens when voices play Chinese Whispers in your head!\"\"That's what happened while Henry Green wrote \"Loving\", right?\"\"Yes, and those voices were just lovely, and unique, and typical of their time and place!\"\"That's enough talking now, I am off to read another novel by Green.\""}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "as the song asks, who wrote the book of love? was it a person who emphasizes the mundanity of experience, the pettiness of people, the tedium of life? is this book of love composed mainly of dialogue - the sort of flat, unremarkable dialogue that one tends to tune out while working, waiting in line, on the bus, at the bank, wherever? is love as magical and life-altering as changing the sheets or clearing the dining room table? is life just predictable, humdrum repetition?\nI've read comparisons of this book to the BBC series Upstairs, Downstairs & Downton Abbey and to the Altman film Gosford Park. haha, that's hilarious. may as well compare dishwater and champagne! this story of the lives of servants in an Irish estate during world war 2 lacks the depth, richness, and resonance of any of those works. it has much more in common with the films of Chantal Akerman: a microscopic fascination with the drab and the commonplace. characters are supposedly realistic but, to me at least, lifeless does not equal real. every single person in the world has an interior life that is more interesting than the way they would look in a snapshot doing some tedious chore. the book itself was rather a chore.but there are admirable things about it - Loving is not what I'd call a bad book. there is a purity to it, in the author's driving need to showcase futility and monotony and uninteresting lives. and Green certainly does have an ear for dialogue. the dullest of dialogue, sure, but dialogue that feels very real. although his characters are boring and flat - they don't even have the zest of caricature - there are some comic moments to be found here and there at their inability to understand even simple situations, let alone each other. misunderstandings leading to frayed feelings and the inability of certain people to read a room are an unamusing but regular part of life; in Loving, they were my primary source of amusement. Green also has a deft hand with the occasional surprising juxtaposition: my favorite bit was a scene where a nanny drones on when reading a story about doves and love, while her young charges pay her no mind and instead intently watch a group of actual doves fornicate and bully each other."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "This is the first Henry Green I have read. It is quite a claustrophobic novel; Updike called Green the \u201csaint of the mundane\u201d and indeed, very little of any significance actually happens. It has been compared to Gosford Park and there are some surface similarities (but rather less action). Loving is set in a rambling country house in Ireland during the early years of the Second World War. The Tennant family move between their Irish country seat and their homes in England (primarily London). The servants are mostly English and remain in Ireland whether the family are in residence or not.Loving revolves around the daily routines of the servants, their petty squabbles, worries, loves, hates and workaday stresses. The war is at a distance, but there are storm clouds on the horizon. There are clouds closer to home relating to some of the local Irish estate workers who may or may not have links to the IRA (also an offstage presence). Loving is driven by dialogue; it is almost stream of consciousness in dialogue form, spare in its descriptions. The cut short and tight dialogue feels a little like some of the \u201ckitchen sink dramas\u201d of the early 1960s. Green has a great ear for ordinary speech. There are clever comic elements woven in; the corpse of the throttled peacock turning up in odd places, the missing and reappearing ring, the lisping insurance evaluator, the scene with the drunken cook and the mistress, befuddled Miss Burch (who never really grasps what is going on). Of course, one cannot escape the sense of this being a fairytale, set outside of time. It starts with \u201cOnce upon\u201d (a day rather than a time) and ends with \u201cand lived happily ever after\u201d. Nevertheless the characters are real and realistic, if cut off from the brutalities of war. The entire novel takes place in the house and grounds; those who leave just fall off the end of the world.This was written in 1945 as the war ended. Green spent the whole war working for the London Fire Brigade and will have seen the height of the blitz and been very much in the centre of some difficult service. Then he writes this, set away from it all in rural Ireland at a time when he was dragging bodies out of burning buildings. Perhaps, like Blake he was looking for a contrast to the \u201cdark satanic mills\u201d of the modern world; but Green insisted on populating it with real and recognisable people.The ending I found difficult and without the obvious fairytale links it would have been trite. However on the whole it worked and I am interested enough to read more and will read Living next. I think this could be called stream of dialogue rather than stream of consciousness, but I do understand why many writers rate it so highly."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201dThey were wheeling wheeling in each other\u2019s arms heedless at the far end where they had drawn up one of the white blinds. Above from a rather low ceiling five great chandeliers swept one after the other almost to the waxed parquet floor reflecting in their hundred thousand drops the single sparkle of distant day, again and again red velvet paneled walls, and two girls, minute in purple, dancing multiplied to eternity in these trembling pears of glass.\u201d\nThe serving staff was fortunate to be employed at the Irish Country Estate far from the bombings that were currently leveling London. Charley Raunce is on the verge of a promotion as he waits patiently for the head butler to breath his last. He will not only assume this new job title, but will also finally be called by his real name. Traditionally, in the Tennant household, he has been referred to as Arthur simply because the first young man employed in that position was named Arthur. It is too much to expect for the Aristocratic family to remember new names. Charley is head butler now and Mrs. Tennant, though struggling to remember, is now required to call him Mr. Raunce. The household is left to their own devices most of the time as the Tennant family moves between their London home and the Irish countryside. One might even say that they have a bit too much time on their hands. Gossip is the best currency and spreading rumors about their employers and each other is the main form of entertainment. All the servants have their own fiefdoms and protect those areas as if they were Knights of the Templer guarding the walls of a castle. After all what they control about the household is the only justification for their existence. Charley is enamored with Edith, and spends quite a bit of time planning ways to catch her by herself. Although that is difficult as Edith and Kate are generally paired together. (They are the two girls that are dancing under the chandeliers.) Henry Green has several scenes where the two maids are more intimate than just good friends, but maybe I am reading those passages with modern eyes.Charley though is always after affection from both girls, \u201dHere, Give us a kiss.\u201d when an opportune moment presents himself. He is rarely successful, but it is all part of the game between him and the young women. Peacocks roam the grounds. When one of the birds is strangled by a visiting boy, the body of the peacock continues to appear and disappear from the strangest places. This provides an ongoing bout of speculations about who was behind the now mystical peacock\u2019s movements. \nHenry GreenHenry Green is not afraid to repeat words, liking the lyricalness of using them again and again. \u201dShe folded the shutters back into the wall. And Edith looked out on the morning, the soft bright morning that struck her dazzled dazzling eyes.\u201dGreen is well respected by British writers many of them giving him credit for inspiring and improving the dialogue they write for their own novels. There are some interesting interplay with conversations in this novel. The humor is subtle and so is the sexuality that I could feel bubbling beneath the surface. \u201dTime magazine included this novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\u201d. This novel also influenced the movie Godsford Park and the hit TV series Downton Abbey.Green had interesting opinions about writing. \"Prose is not to be read aloud but to oneself alone at night, and it is not quick as poetry but rather a gathering web of insinuations [...] Prose should be a direct intimacy between strangers with no appeal to what both may have known. It should slowly appeal to fears unexpressed, it should in the end draw tears out of the stone.\"\nI had to see what a person named \u201cDig\u201d looked like. Adelaide Biddulph Yorke.Green\u2019s real name is Henry Vincent Yorke and he is descended from wealthy landowners. He studied at Oxford University where he developed a friendship and rivalry with Evelyn Waugh. Typing his name just now reminds me how tragically long it has been since I\u2019ve read Waugh. Green married his second cousin the Hon. Adelaide Biddulph in 1929. Her nickname was \u201cDig\u201d which I find rather charming for someone of her pedigree. Green published his last novel in 1952 and become a scholar of the Ottoman Empire, a recluse, and an alcoholic until his death in 1973. It is tragic how many writers, artists, and movie stars end up in similar circumstances as their creativity turns to dust."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14987742-doug", "userReview": "I've always preferred character-driven novels to plot-driven ones, but I'm not sure what to make of a dialogue-driven novel. Especially one so laden with seemingly purposeful obfuscation. What's going on? Who's zooming who? Who's even who for that matter? Two different Alberts, a Charley who used to be known as Arthur and who is now trying at being a Mr. Raunce? I think this novel is interesting as a literary oddity and I particularly enjoyed the dialogue, but I also found it a royal pain to read. I know I'm a slow reader, but it took me 11 days to get through it and it's only 240 pages long. Green doesn't hand anything to you easily. Or, maybe I'm thick.This was the second Henry Green novel I've read and I'm glad it wasn't my first, being a bit too obtuse for my liking. Some say it's his best, but I didn't get nearly as much from it as I did from Back. That one also required close (almost investigative) reading, but I got a bigger payoff from it.

Green has been called \u201ca writer\u2019s writer\u2019s writer\u201d and praised to kingdom come by everyone that counts. And yes, his dialogue is masterful and there are real moments of light in his prose. His cinematic movement from scene to scene is unusual (one character will look out a window at two others in the distance and the narrative immediately moves to them without a break). Strange too, his habit of this-ing and that-ing everyone after he\u2019s introduced them by name into a scene, so that Edith (for example) walks into a room and we are told that \u201cthis woman [Edith] then stepped quickly aside\u201d (not a real quote, but gives you the idea). In its tightly drawn scenes and play of voices, \u2018Loving\u2019 has a way of flickering warmly through the mind after you set it aside. I enjoyed it, and appreciated it. Personally, however, I think Anthony Powell at his best (\u2018Buyer\u2019s Market,\u2019 \u2018The Kindly Ones,\u2019 \u2018Books Do Furnish a Room\u2019) is better, and funnier for all his melancholy. Not that comparisons count for anything, but there you go.UPDATE: In bed before my alarm went off this morning it occurred to me: This book is a fairy tale. There's the standard opening (\"once upon\") and standard closing (\"ever after\"), of course. That's an obvious tip off. But there's more too: the star-crossed lovers (sorta), the castle (definitely), the threat from without (IRA, WWII, insurance man), etc... Okay, I get it.

Written in 1945 well before the hugely popular tv series, UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, and its equally popular successor, DOWNTON ABBEY, it made me think of the dark side of those two series. It, too, has the comings and goings of both the \u201cdownstairs\u201d staff and the \"upstairs\u201d owners. In Green\u2019s version, the manor house, Kinalty Castle, is located in Ireland, owned and staffed almost entirely by British who, top to bottom, complain about the barbarities of this backward country, so\u201d backward\u201d that it doesn\u2019t even take sides during World War II, being fought as the novel progresses. The one Irish employee, a stable hand, speaks with such a dreadful accent (according to the British), that no one can understand his utterances.I say the \u201cdark side\u201d as no one comes across as admirable in this depiction of the cross-section of this manor house, but on the other hand, there are no real villains either, Just a lot of bumbling self-seeking characters all of whom are living under some tension. The tension can be found in the head butler, Charley Raunce and his fear of being sacked for petty embezzlement, of having his affair with a maid twenty years younger found out, or even some odd symptons of ill health. No one quite trusts Charley, including staff members who drink too much or are envious of him. And the upstairs owners have their anxieties as well. Jack Tennant, the dowager owner\u2019s son, is off to the war, leaving behind his wayward wife.Much of this tension comes to a focus upon a ring which is lost, then found by a staff member but not returned, only to be taken again by one of three children who are staying at the Castle. Eventually, it makes its way back to the owner, but no one is quite sure of where it has been. In a way this is a reflection of the plot which wanders haphazardly with the logic of, or lack of it, a fairy tale. In fact, the story opens like a fairy tale (\u201conce upon a day\u201d) and closes the same way (\u201chappily ever after\u201d).The strength of the novel lies in the dialogue, what people say, and is amusing. It's inconsistent from day to day. \u201cOh it\u2019s disgustin\u2019 that\u2019s what this old place is, it\u2019s horrible\u201d, says young Edith to old Charley who is insistent upon her sitting on his lap. The characters talk about going to England, getting involved in the war effort, and at the same the time speak fearfully of the dreaded IRA, or worse, the Germans who migtht actually invade the country. \u201can\u2019 all on top of all this bombing, not to mention the invasion with Jerry set to cross over with drawn swords, it\u2019s plenty to get anyone down.\u201d And then where would they be? But no one, aside from 18 year old Albert, an underling to Charley, makes any moves to return to England. At the end, Charley and Edith do flee, but that action is undercut by describing them as living \u201chappily ever after.\u201dIs the novel a comedy or not? The dialogue is genuinely funny, people changing their attitudes toward day-to-day duties and frustrations, mostly petty, except for the missing ring blowup, but you can sense a world that is shifting, one that is going to make this lifestyle obsolete. World War II will change everything, it\u2019s becoming expensive to maintain this \u201cold place\u201d (suggested by big sections of the castle that are closed off), Charley and Edith\u2019s running off at the end is a recognition that the life of servants is over; the novel opens with the foreshadowing death of the old butler whose place Charley is taking \u2013 temporarily. The peacocks represent this castle \u2013 beautiful spread tail feathers, but they make horrible screeches that negate their surface beauty. I\u2019d call it a comedy, then, but one with dark overtones. Those same overtones can be found in the later tv series about the end of the big houses, but they\u2019re generally exercises in serious nostalgia, unlike where LOVING puts its emphasis."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Urello", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4516382-elizabeth-urello", "userReview": "Henry Green\u2019s most beloved novel focuses on the complicated relationships between the servants of an Irish country house during World War II. At the time of the novel, Ireland is neutral territory, remote from the escalating conflict and mostly abandoned by the English gentry who own homes there. The servants are left alone with their employers\u2019 children, and thus free, they fight, love, ally, steal and work.Green is a master at painting beautiful pastoral settings and then focusing on the myriad, nagging daily stresses of the people living in them - both in this novel, and in my personal favorite of his novels, Concluding. While the servants at the Tennants\u2019 manor are removed from the horrible war and mostly left alone to do their chores and mind their own affairs, every character in Loving is plagued by innumerable stresses. These are not carefree people. They worry about putting away enough for retirement, they worry about their families back in England, they throw themselves into power struggles, they lie, they steal, they torment each other. They fall ill, they throw tantrums, they emotionally blackmail each other. They deliberate about enlisting, moving, staying put, escaping. They fear the Germans, they fear the IRA.The best scenes in the novel are those which Green describes carefully in close focus, and where the events occurring are so closely wedded to the setting that one relies entirely on the other - the dovecoat where the children play and the lovers meet, the cavernous gallery where Edith and her charges play a game of blind man\u2019s buff, the eccentric lampman\u2019s saddleroom with the window into the peacocks\u2019 shed where the maids are caught snooping by the butler. The central figures of the novel - the butler, Charley Raunce, and the housemaid, Edith - are clearly made for each other. Both dim and conniving, they negotiate an ever-changing workaday morality all their own - skimming off the top of the house\u2019s finances is only smart, but stealing property is over the line...mostly. Raunce is constant in his affections, but produces a never-ending torrent of unnecessary falsehoods whenever he feels himself cornered or disrespected, and is often suspected of more cunning than he possesses. Edith is ever careful of the feelings of the staff, but tucks away information on them for when she might need it. Innocent and easily scandalized on the surface, she is in fact a master of manipulation, sexual and otherwise. Loving is a novel overshadowed by a great war and made up of many small ones, and in the end, we know that Edith, at any rate, will be among the survivors. And that is as it should be, because in Green\u2019s Britain, the manor is but the playground of the servants."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8051792-lisa", "userReview": "It took me a while to adjust to the cadence of Loving. The novel is about the daily lives of servants in a large \"castle\" in Ireland during WWII. It is all dialogue with gossip, scandal, alliances and coupling. Everything is on the surface with flitting dark undertones. The novel moves easily from conversation to conversation - with no inner thoughts, no character history, no plot, no conclusion.

Green another of the British Modernists who makes me wonder how it is that I never knew. Do they teach him in America? Wood acts like everybody knows him. Green's style, like Joyce's, Forster's and Virginia Woolf's, is intensely subjective and tricky with point of view shifts and heightened interiority, but takes you off guard due to the ostensible linearity of the narrative. The language is dense and crafted but seems honest to me and not overly self-consicus, capturing in some kind of amazing pitch (I can't say it's perfect because it's foreign to me) working class rural Britain during wartime. The turns of phrase will make you want to commit THEFT. A historic context of IRA incursions and war-dead, and splits between dialect speakers and those who can inhabit highbrow manners and linguistics, makes it layered and complicated. And yet the plot is simple and slight, but it's there, and gives the book a straightforward momentum. It took me a long time to read this book but it was worth every second. It might have been worth it just for the presence of a Vardamon-like character who is never reported communicating in words but can be understood through the one character who is bilingual in both dialect and Queen's English.

Green is too frequently a stenographer when I want him to be an author.Sure the dialogue is, well, realistic, true to life, etc., but it doesn\u2019t hold nearly the same subtext as, say, Hemingway, who also privileged the author as an objective witness. In fact, the reason Hemingway reads better than Green, and is more illuminating, is because he never truly dared to actually surrender himself (thank God!).Henry Green said that he aimed to \u201ccreate \u2018life\u2019 which does not eat, procreate, or drink, but which can live in people who are alive.\u201d Updike praises Green as a \u201csaint of the mundane,\u201d which is unfortunately accurate: Green bathes in the mundane, breathes the mundane, eats the mundane\u2014and procreates in the mundane. In fact, my reading experience was so mundane that I kept getting distracted by the dishes, the laundry, and the bills, but not by any of the big life questions and thoughts I like to read for.Updike writes that Green\u2019s \u201cobservations of the world appear as devoid of prejudice and preconception as a child\u2019s.\u201d I only wish he could have presented a scene from a child\u2019s point of view, with the jarring perspective that children so often provide simply because they are not \u201csaints of mundane,\u201d but steeped in the kind of authorial personality that continually demands interpretation and reinterpretation.I do agree with one of Updike\u2019s comments. He calls Green\u2019s novels \u201cphotographs of a vanished England,\u201d which is my overwhelming response to Loving. I felt as if I were walking through an odd sort of literary museum, observing some of the interesting details of class differences in England, eavesdropping, but never quite experiencing the high points of dramatic intrigue, a story that is shaped with a point of view\u2014the fundamental characteristics of a meaningful narrative.I\u2019m sure that Green\u2019s novels served a more forceful and urgent purpose in the era he wrote them (from approximately 1920 to 1950), and he\u2019s a capable author in certain ways. He does create a polyphony of voices in the novel, so that life sounds like a hammering dialogue of competing needs.

I find some books (and their rankings) decay shortly after reading.But Loving... It should be a 4-star, a very good novel, but it is so very sui generis - if one can say 'so very' in the case of uniqueness - and is so vibrant in the mind a couple weeks after reading that it really deserves to be spoken of.I've read this in the Loving/Living/Party Going omnibus from Penguin, having had it on my shelf for some time. It will take some time to get to the others, as I dislike reading multiples by the same author in any span, but if Loving is any indication, this is an author that deserves to be had and read.It's strange to read this while Downton Abbey is popular, and to think of it as, perhaps (probably) inspiration for Ishiguro's Remains of the Day, as it feels completely within its own universe. Green's style is incredibly supple, incredibly its own, and the contents of the story dreamlike, a combination of the mythic and the mundane. So very gently charged, lasting, yet resolutely minor, aided by the gerund of the title and the milieu -- a neutral Ireland early during World War II.I think this is not for everyone. I accept that Henry Green will never be exhumed to major aplomb, but this is almost a comfort, and shadows the gift of the thing itself.So, others have described the 'plot' of the book, or its concerns. It can be a difficult read, insofar as who is spoken of, and their relationships, are not initially clear. And, provided its elliptical conduct of time, placement and situation are not always remotely piercing, but there are peacocks shrieking in the distance, there is a strange temple young girls walk to, there is the oddity of a household of servants going on, and then Raunce and his romance. Much of this is dialogue, but what an ear.The first and last sentences spell this as a fairy tale; I dislike the last sentence, as it takes on the power of authorial irony that had not previous existed. Yet, still.

A couple of months back, I read Ishiguro's REMAINS OF THE DAY that got a full 5-star rating from me. However, even if it is also a British novel, Ishiguro made sure that the non-British readers would not feel left out.I picked this book because it is among 100 All-TIME Magazine Best Novels.

It is told entirely from the point of view of the servants. Charlie Raunce is a Machiavellian butler who, at the novels beginning, succeeds to his position when the old and beloved butler dies. What follows is a love story, with gossip, about the doings of the servants. Charlie is in love with the housekeeper Edith. Edith\u2019s younger housekeeper friend Kate is in love with O\u2019Connor, the sole Irish servant, whom no one but she can understand. The cook pads the food bill to buy gin. Charlie finds the old butler\u2019s secret books itemizing tips and various low level embezzlements. The cook\u2019s nephew is up from England, causing havoc among the 200 peacocks. The owners are Mrs. Tenant, a widow, and her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Jack, whose husband is at war, and who is caught in bed by Edith with a neighbor. The servants are all English and wish to return to England but are afraid of being conscripted, and of the blitz. They also fear for their families left behind. Fear is a constant in the book. They are afraid of the IRA and of Ireland allowing Germany to attack England from its shores. And Mrs. Tenant is afraid of hiring Irish servants, so despite her suspicions of her household feels she can\u2019t afford to lose anyone. And Mrs. Jack, who was discovered naked in bed with a man not her husband, is afraid the servants will tell her mother-in-law, rendering every conversation between them hilarious and awkward as the unstated seems to hover on each of their lips.There is in all this the strong taste of decline. The castle is mostly shut up. There is only the one visitor, the man whom Mrs. Jack is having an affair with. They are in exile from England and from the past, though all are conscious of the tradition of service, and the importance of maintaining it as security against the chaos and violence of the outside world. In this sense the castle is a prison, and, also, with the beauty of spring, and the wandering peacocks and the flocks of doves in the dovecote, a magic castle in bent pastoral. And the love story, between Raunce and Edith, which develops gently throughout, is genuine. The constant irony that snaps at its heels never overcomes it. The humor of the book is deeply human, and subtly woven into every sentence."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim", "userReview": "This is not a novel from which it is easy to quote. And it is not a novel that is widely known. Reading Henry Green is like a guilty pleasure, one that separates you from the unwashed masses. Here is an industrialist who not only knows how to write, but who feels intensely. His characters come to life -- not from saying things that are significant, but for living their life intensely.Loving is set at Kinalty Castle in Ireland during the early days of the bombardment of London. Both the owners and the serving staff are English, so English that they are reluctant to deal with the Irish that surround them. We begin with the death of the old butler, Eldon, who dies with a woman's name on her lips. He is replaced by the footman, Charley Rauce, who falls deeply in love with one of the housemaids, Edith. The owners, the Tenant family -- or what's left of them -- are distrustful of the servants, who in turn are distrustful of the blue-haired Mrs Tennant and her philandering daughter, Mrs Jack. It seems that the life of a grand manorial estate hangs in the balance. Many of the servants are old and sickly, and there are divisions between the different \"fiefs\" that constitute the Kinalty.It's hard to put one's finger on why Green is such a great writer. He is so even-handed in his dealings with both the upstairs and downstairs contingents that it seems we are watching the situation evolve before our eyes. I will have to read more of his work before being able to pass more articulate judgment on his work."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/977989-dave", "userReview": "I've been trying to get into this book since high school, and it finally clicked for me. It's not really that challenging--it's nothing you haven't seen onscreen in Gosford Park. But it's the opposite of Virginia Woolf--instead of staying internal and stream-of-conscious, it's all external: spoken, overheard, and muttered under one's breath. There's rather more of the latter than really happens; but it works so well, and manages to be so sensual and so real, even when people are behaving a little more like comic characters than they would in real life. So not as good as V.W., but very very good nonetheless. The blind man's bluff scene, and the scene on the beach are two of my favorites. My least favorite is the insurance man with the lisp."}, {"userName": "P.S.

LOVING. (1945; U.S. 1949). Henry Green. **.\tAs with most other inveterate readers, I am always on the lookout for new (different) authors that I\u2019ve missed. When playing on Google, I came across a list of the 100 Best Novels put together by Modern Library. Looking through this list, I came across this book. I had never heard of either the title or the author, and got a copy from our library system. It was a Penguin, with an introduction by John Updike. I\u2019m always suspicious of books from the modern age that have introductions, but I\u2019m a fan of Updike, and he, apparently, was a fan of Green. It was a loving intro, with nothing but high praise for this British author who, during his career wrote nine novels. When I got to the fine print, I gleaned that he was considered a \u201cwriter\u2019s writer\u201d whose novels never sold more than 10,000 copies and, aside from thie Penguin, were mostly out of print. With all of that reassurace, I leaped into the book. \u201cLoving\u201d is about the lives of the residents of a castle in Ireland during WW II, both the owners and the servants \u2013 though mostly the servants. There was no visible plot, and the book itself was mostly dialogue. The dialogue was not stream of consciousness, but something close to it. According to Mr. Updike, Mr. Green was influenced in his writing by the book \u201cTravels in Arabia Desert,\u201d which I read about thirty years ago. It was that author\u2019s attempt to put into English the Arabic way of expressing themselves. That\u2019s how it came across. Although Mr. Green was admired by other writers as some sort of trailblazing, he seems to have forgotten his reader \u2013 or at least readers like me.

It was hard for me because there were so many colloquialisms. In addition, I couldn't figure out who was speaking until well into the book. But in the end I could see the merit. This is not a plot driven novel nor are there intriguing characters like Downton Abbey. It reveals the life of English staff at an Irish house at the time of the war and how their attitudes toward toward the neutral Irish are. But you do get the picture and a more realistic picture of life in service at this particular time and in this particular place. After I finally was settled into the book, I appreciated the broad humor - including lisping insurance men, adulterous daughter-in-laws, strangled peacocks and larcenous staff. I can't say that I would have persisted if this hadn't been one of John Updike's favorite writers.

This is what I liked about the dialogue format of Loving, you'd have a conversation between two characters who'd see other characters in passing and the story and the dialogue then seamlessly move to those characters. Yet in these conversation, characters often don't pay a slightest bit of notice on what the other person is saying. This is sometimes funny but also gets a bit repetitive since it goes in circles. The missing waterglass, the dead peacock, the cluster ring, the Captain, the IRA, Albert, Albert and Albert, Mrs Welch is at her gin again, here give us a kiss.
