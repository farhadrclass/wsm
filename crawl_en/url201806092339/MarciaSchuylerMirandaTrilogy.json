She wrote over 100 novels along the lines of Louisa May Alcott, Lucy Maud Montgomery, and Laura Ingalls Wilder. Simple stories, romantic, heart warming. What's not to like? They provide a short, easy read, a nice break when one is needed."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3648009-heather", "userReview": "When I was younger, we would go visit my great-aunt during the summers. She lived in this bitty town in nowhere-southern Indiana. She talked non-stop, called everyone by their first and middle names together, set her thermostat at 60 degrees, and cooked with real butter and cream. She told everyone how to do everything. For entertainment, we would drive around to check on how the corn was doing or out to the old farm in Paxton or down to Vincennes to see the new prison. When the drive was over, there would still be 6 1/2 days of visit left to fill, and all that was left was walking to the Walmart and reading through her bookcase. She had *the most* moral selection of literature, including dozens of novels by Grace Livingston Hill that had belonged to her mother. I used to average about three a day, lying on the floor in the study while the air conditioner blasted and my great-aunt told my mother the best way to do laundry.This novel was always one of my favorites because it wasn't a contemporary -- kind of hysterical since even her contemporary novels now read like the fustiest of period pieces. Anyway, being set in the early 1830s seemed like a reasonable excuse for being so unbelieveably wholesome.As usual, my favorite parts are the details -- clothes, food, houses. The characters are over the top -- dastardly cad Harry Temple, saintly younger sister Marcia, brazen hussy Kate... you get the idea. My favorite line describes our hero: \"His hands were white and firm, the fingers long and shapely, the hands of a brain worker.\" Which has to be the least attractive compliment ever. But the book reminds me of my great-aunt who made the best mashed potatoes, and my mother who used to say that if the hero wanted his marriage to succeed, he would stop calling his wife \"child\" -- not her idea of a successful endearment -- and who had read through my great-aunt's bookcase during the summers when she was a girl."}, {"userName": "Sophie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2610033-sophie", "userReview": "Marcia Schuyler revolves around Marcia and her sister Kate and their relationship with David Spafford. The story begins a few days before Kate is to wed David. Marcia sees David's worth and rejoices in her sister's good fortune, but Kate herself finds David too staid and moralising. As a result, she elopes with another man the night before the wedding. On the morning of the wedding, the Schuyler family discovers Kate's note explaining what she has done, and Mr. Schuyler, disgraced by his daughter's betrayal, offers his younger daughter, Marcia, to David as recompense. Marcia, seeing David's heartbreak, and eager to help him avoid the embarrassment of returning home without the bride he came to fetch agrees, as does David. Marcia is seventeen, but described as a child just approaching womanhood. David is twenty-seven so the difference in their ages is a little uncomfortable, although that kind of age difference was common in romances of old.Marcia and David are married by chapter six and the rest of the book chronicles the trials of their marriage--Marcia moving away and dealing with David's interfering aunts, David dealing with his broken heart, and both dealing with the fallout of swapping one bride for another--and the romance as they eventually find each other. It's not a story that contains many surprises (it's a romance after all, and we know where it's headed) but the journey is an enjoyable one. My biggest criticisms of the book would be the one-dimensional characters--the good characters (Marcia and David) are impossibly good; Marcia, especially, never puts a foot wrong, is admired by all who see her, and practically has woodland characters following her and singing to her like some animated Disney heroine; and the bad characters are saturated with evil (Kate, for instance, and her cohort, Harry Temple, who plot to ruin Marcia to revenge themselves on David)--and the overwrought prose. I also felt there were certain class distinctions that grated on my modern sensibilities (for instance, lower-class characters are given dialect, even in written letters) and the \"third act\" drags a bit as characters achieve realizations we thought they'd reached long ago, or reach the same conclusion over and over.The story takes place in the 1830s and one subplot revolves around the development of a steam railway in Albany, NY. David is a journalist with his own small-town newspaper, but somehow is involved in making the dream of a steam railway a reality. Hill is rather vague on how a journalist is involved in making the railway happen, but it is a convenient plot device to get David out of town about halfway through the novel. I enjoyed the historical aspects of the story--Hill does a good job of recreating the era and some details were fascinating. For instance, at an evening gathering to celebrate David and Marcia's wedding we're told, \"They served cake and raspberry vinegar then, and a little while after everybody went home.\" Do you suppose they drank the vinegar? Or dipped the cake in it? And was that a well known signal for everyone to go home? It's an intriguing question.Overall, I liked the book. It held my attention and I wanted to keep reading it. I never felt like I was slogging through it, and I definitely want to read the remaining two books in the Miranda trilogy (Phoebe Deane and Miranda)."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15728061-emily", "userReview": "This book was so fascinating that I could hardly put it down or stop thinking about it. I read it as fast as I could because I just *had* to know the ending! The story revolves around 3 people whose lives are forever changed the day of a wedding. I can't say more without exposing the main theme of the story - the main problem to be dealt with. I found it very captivating. It's not necessarily a happy read for a good chunk of the book. It can be quite heartbreaking and emotionally taxing as you long to see right prevail, and redemption and happiness and true love win. It is so beautiful to watch that unfold, but a little heartbreaking at the same time. There are scoundrels in the book who plot mischievous things and serve to keep you on the edge of your seat, holding your breath for the outcome. In the end, though it was very sad at times, I found the story to be quite beautiful and satisfying. I would definitely read it again!"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3401865-nancy", "userReview": "This book, written in 1908, was a surprise to me concerning the \"soap opera\" content.

The first time, I loved it. The second time, I merely liked it. The third time around, I just loved it again. The plot is unusual in a way. Marcia Schuyler was supposed to be a bridesmaid for her sister, instead she became the bride and married her sister's intended groom. All with the permission of the parents...and the groom of course! Her sister decided the morning of the wedding that she was marrying the wrong man, she decided to elope with someone else instead. It was an awkward situation, the awkwardness being somewhat postponed by the switching of the brides. Most people not realizing until the middle of the ceremony what had happened. Marcia is soon swept away to her new home, new town, new life. Still wearing her sister's clothes, still trying to be someone she's not quite. It's a safe marriage, a happy one too, for the most part. David and Marcia are quite friendly with one another, very respectful of one another. This is a romance novel where the falling in love occurs after the wedding ceremony. The novel can be dramatic in places; readers have not heard the last from sister Kate! And there is another villain, Harry, who also has a role to play. The novel features many memorable characters: David has three aunts, then there's the neighbor girl, Miranda, and then there's Hannah, a woman who was desperate to catch David and is still resentful. The novel is set in America in the 1830s. A subplot in this one is the 'progress' of the nation and the introduction of the steam engine, the railroad. It all being oh-so-new and oh-so-dangerous. David is for the railroad, many others are not. Much of Marcia's story is set within the home involving the keeping of the household: cooking, cleaning, sewing, etc."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22090735-christy", "userReview": "I probably would not re-visit this author; the writing style meanders along with many ponderings and descriptions and I was always ready to get back to the story.

I don't know if I ever really knew any of the characters, even Marcia; she just never seemed real.

This story seems to have had a Jacob wants to marry Rachel and gets stuck with Leah inspiration, but with an interesting twist and rather happier ending. It's vividly set in the 1850s, before the Civil War. The story starts on what will be, unbeknownst to her, the last day of Marcia's trusting childhood. She wants a new dress, but with all the expenses for her sister's wedding, she decides to earn the money for the fabric by picking blackberries, and sew the dress herself. That evening her family is astonished at the change in her with the simple dress and a new hairstyle. She's becoming a woman. That evening Kate goes out with friends for one last time before getting married, and gets dropped off by a man her father considered an unsuitable suitor. The next day, out-of-town David Spafford is set to marry Marcia's older sister, Kate, whom he's enamored of but barely knows. Marcia admires David greatly and looks forward to him being her brother-in-law. David basically chose Kate thinking she was a decent gal, like his friend her father. Not hardly. Kate puts on an act when David's there, but she's haughty, petulant, domineering, and selfish. And on the morning of the wedding they find that Kate has run off with the earlier suitor. The family honor will be in tatters when it becomes known. David (whom Marcia admires) is devastated, and Marcia offers herself as a substitute bride. The substitution is made, and no one realizes it was Marcia under that veil until they exchange vows. David is at first very grateful, and treats her like a sister, but he still pines after Kate. Within a few days he realizes what a selfish, stupid thing he's done, and how it might hurt Marcia, but he cannot back out. He's consumed with guilt. Marcia makes the best of it but slowly realizes she's traded any future happiness for her family's honor. And just when she is starting to find some comfort in the marriage of convenience, her sister shows up and--despite being married to someone else--makes a play for getting David back. The circumstances that cause David and Marcia to finally realize they actually love each other are too intricate and wonderful to give away here but definitely worth reading about. And much of it has to do with a freckle-faced, corker of a lonely girl named Miranda they rescue from an unloving home to live with them as a maid. Miranda is one of those secondary characters that demands her own book, and she gets two of them after this. That's why this is subtitled Miranda Trilogy, #1."}, {"userName": "Bethany Rivera", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63640746-bethany-rivera", "userReview": "Reading Grace Livingston-Hill is new for me but certainly not new for my family. My grandparents, who live in California, sent over two boxes of her novels and works. If you\u2019re a fan of Livingston-Hill you\u2019ll understand how very many books that is. On Goodreads alone, it says she had 220 distinct works. Luckily, I\u2019ve just received around 60 or 70 of her works-so get ready for a lot of Livingston-Hill book reviews.  *Warning-Spoilers* My opinion of the first book would be that it was difficult- not in the sense that it was slow or not easy to get into. This novel was published in 1808, and it was more of the mindset that was difficult to get into. For instance, when Kate runs away and marries her Beau. The Schuyler's are devastated and betrayed, but what bothers them more than the family name being slandered, is that David will be wife-less and would be embarrassed returning home as a single man. Being a 24 year old woman, I would never think that if I decided to leave a fiance and elope with another man...that my father would insist my 17 year old sister marrying my abandoned fiance. Once getting past the generation and era difference and simply realizing things were different in 1808-I truly enjoyed the book. It is a romance novel, the entire trilogy is, and it is beautifully done. It is shown when Marcia holds her vows and respects them, even though they are made to a man who should not have been her husband. How she truly falls in love with David and they spend the remainder of their years together. Marcia truly is a feminist of her time. I do have to say, the characters did not seem real or \u201cfleshed out\u201d at some parts, but it truly is worth reading and finishing the trilogy. The best part of the novel for me was the introduction of Miranda (it is called the Miranda trilogies for a reason!) and her cheeky personality."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28407732-leah", "userReview": "Great romance book.

I will confess, the title seemed so boring and unromantic, but I like Grace's writing style so I decided to go ahead with it. Also, I wanted to read Miranda, but it's the third book in the trilogy and this is the first. I was very pleasantly surprised, as I knew I would be as soon as I read the first few pages.I don't know how many times I've thought about a plot like this, where a girl ends up caring for and loving her sister's husband because her sister doesn't really care about him. I seriously didn't know that someone already wrote a book about it.I blushingly share with you, my favourite quote: \"A desire to stoop and kiss the fair face came to him, not for affection\u2019s sake, but reverently, as if to render to her before God some fitting sign that he knew and understood her act of self sacrifice, and would not presume upon it.Slowly, as though he were performing a religious ceremony, a sacred duty laid upon him on high, David stooped over her, bringing his face to the gentle sleeping one. Her sweet breath fanned his cheek like the almost imperceptible fragrance of a bud not fully opened yet to give forth its sweetness to the world. His soul, awake and keen through the thoughts that had just come to him, gave homage to her sweetness, sadly, wistfully, half wishing his spirit free to gather this sweetness for his own.And so he brought his lips to hers, and kissed her, his bride, yet not his bride. Kissed her for the second time. That thought came to him with the touch of the warm lips and startled him. Had there been something significant in the fact that he had met Marcia first and kissed her instead of Kate by mistake?It seemed as though the sleeping lips clung to his lingeringly, and half responded to the kiss, as Marcia in her dreams lived over again the kiss she had received by her father\u2019s gate in the moonlight. Only the dream lover was her own and not another\u2019s. David, as he lifted up his head and looked at her gravely, saw a half smile illuminating her lips as if the sleeping soul within had felt the touch and answered to the call.\"I found a very interesting similarity between this book and The Mystery of Mary:' \"Do you, Mary, take this man?\" came the next question, and the girl looked up with clear eyes and said, \"I do.\"Then the minister's wife, who knew and prized Tryon Dunham's friendship, said to herself: \"It's all right. She loves him.\" ' ~ The Mystery of Mary'She held up her flower-like head and answered in her clear voice, that made her few schoolmates present gasp with admiration: \u201cI will!\u201dAnd the dear old minister\u2019s wife, sitting sweet and dove-like in her soft grey poplin, fine white kerchief, and cap of book muslin, smiled to herself at the music in Marcia\u2019s voice and nodded approval. She felt that all was well with her little friend.' ~ Marcia SchuylerI truly love this book and cannot talk any more about it.

To make things easiest on both families (and on David), Marcia agrees to step in and marry him in her sister's stead.But David is so grieved by the loss of his love, the breaking of a vow, the shattering of the bright future he envisioned, that he turns inward, and then to his work, all but ignoring Marcia completely. She's alone in his hometown, far from family and friends, harped at by his elderly aunts and mocked by his neighbor (who fancied him hers). And just when it seems so hopeless, Kate decides she wants David back, and that her sister was living on her seconds long enough.I... didn't like David. Upright he might've been, but completely self-centered the entire book. He hurt Marcia as much as Kate, the neighbor girl, and the old aunts did. I didn't like that about the book.
