I read the book for my book club, and was happy to do so as I enjoy books set in the Middle East. Also, I was curious what the novel would reveal about the plight of the Palestinians, a subject close to my heart.Most of all, I enjoyed the descriptions of Jordan. I appreciate that the novel presents the Palestinian point of view\u2014something rarely seen in fiction by Westerners. The Palestinian characters spoke for themselves, explaining their family history and their grievances.Less authentic was the portrayal of Palestinian family life. I just could not imagine a young Palestinian Muslim woman flaunting her new British boyfriend in front of her older brother, her mother, her grandmother and her co-workers. Very hard to believe. Likewise, I could not wrap my head around a hijab-clad Palestinian Muslim grandmother who lives in rural West Bank and who serves arak (alcohol) to her guests. Hmmm\u2026 (The scenes set in the West Bank are less convincing than those in Jordan.)Olives is a novel where few characters are who they appear to be. At one point, it looked as if all the Palestinian characters (except the grandmother) were either terrorists or supporters of terrorism. This would have been hard to swallow, but fortunately, the story switched directions. I recommend this book to those who enjoy genre fiction: thrillers, suspense or romance. This is a book for readers who want a casual introduction to the Palestinian-Israeli crisis. Mostly, it\u2019s a good book for those interested in Jordan."}, {"userName": "Bob", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1145819-bob", "userReview": "I attended a workshop that McNabb presented at the Dubai Literature Festival where he said he'd self-published Olives after being turned down by over 80 agents. What a crowd of pillocks they were. This is an incredibly well written book. The hero doesn't know what is the truth of his situation until the very last page and you won't either. The writing is very high level, the knowledge of the Middle East and the political situation very detailed. I've visited Jordan as a tourist and recognised places, scenes and bits of atmosphere that he describes, so know that he does all of that well. I believed this book. Everything in it convinced me. The Arabs were like the ones I work with, those charming folk who can be so easy to like and so hard to understand. The characters were all real people to me, their motivations often confusing, but always credible. This is a book that I'll be lending to friends and nagging them to read. They'll thank me for it, though, I know they will."}, {"userName": "Simon Forward", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4432776-simon-forward", "userReview": "Yet another independent offering in an ever-expanding sea of self-published novels. Maybe it\u2019s the circles I move in, but I\u2019m bombarded daily via Twitter and Facebook and the like to read this ebook and that ebook. It\u2019s the shape of the future and if more indie novels were as good as Olives by Alexander McNabb then mainstream publishing would have cause to tremble.Of course, if quality was the only gauge then the market wouldn\u2019t be so flooded with high-profile dross from the big publishing houses and you wouldn\u2019t find any good books remaindered and selling 3 for a fiver in your local bargain bookstore. (I\u2019ve found them, although the challenge is finding 3 good ones at the same time to qualify for the offer.) It\u2019s all about the publicity, the marketing, the prominence given to titles on the shelves \u2013 or, in the ebook world, on websites \u2013 and I can only hope Olives garners the recognition and attention it deserves.To that end, this review.Now, hand on heart, in the interests of full disclosure, I chose to give this book a read because I know the author. The fact is, I often end up reading friends\u2019 books, whether through volunteering to proofread the MS or, as in this case, simply because I\u2019m familiar with the guy\u2019s work and so there\u2019s a trust that the book will be of a certain quality. Given the unfeasibly huge range of indie books out there, this might as well be one of the selection criteria. Anyway, with that in mind, I always do my best to be as objective and critical as possible, regardless of connection with the author or (in the case of TV, movies etc) anyone else involved, but by all means feel free to make allowances while weighing this review.Olives is a courageous work, far braver than anything I\u2019d venture to write. A white guy writing about the Middle East? Must be mad to try.But McNabb has lived and worked in the region for decades and writes with an assured confidence, while taking the precaution of introducing his first-person protagonist a fish out of water. Indeed, Paul Stokes, journalist, never really reaches a full understanding of the world into which his career has thrown him and there\u2019s a sense that no matter how much he learns he will remain to some extent out of his depth. It\u2019s an admission most of us might make on Middle Eastern mattersAccording to the publishing world \u2013 agents and editors - readers aren\u2019t going to be very interested in a tale centred on Middle Eastern troubles. Maybe I\u2019m strange, but I shake my head at this wisdom - it seems to be lacking the full set of pillars \u2013 and at the risk of turning hippy it strikes me that we all need to embrace a little understanding if we\u2019re ever to find peace. So while every bomb and shooting disinclines me to watch the news and while every arduous airport security check puts me off travel, I welcome this novel as a rare opportunity to lift the curtain on the region.Rest assured, it won\u2019t bore you with the issues. It\u2019s not some stale classroom lesson or documentary. It\u2019s fiction. It\u2019s an initially slow-burning thriller, a deftly mixed cocktail of political and sexual tension that \u2013 very broadly \u2013 puts me in mind of The Year Of Living Dangerously: romantic heat against a backdrop of political troubles. And after drawing you in, it becomes genuinely un-putdownable at around the halfway mark.Where it\u2019s especially clever is in its deliberate eschewing of religious issues in favour of a far more fundamental concern \u2013 water \u2013 and a very human story of people embroiled in and affected by the long history of conflict. It takes care to offer balance too and I\u2019m thinking particularly of a powerful scene involving an Israeli border guard that, for all its relatively incidental nature, provides the most effective reminder that there are far more lives \u2013 on all sides \u2013 touched by the violence than the central family to which Paul attaches himself.The only faction who perhaps don\u2019t receive an even-handed treatment are the British, as represented by the odious Gerald Lynch, but to say too much about him might entail straying too far into spoiler territory and I\u2019m keen to avoid that.For me, the only areas in which the book falls a little short of the mark are with the Swede, Lars - whose dialogue is peppered with faltering English and all the Scandinavians I\u2019ve ever met have never suffered anything like that in the language department \u2013 and, curiously, in Paul Stokes himself. As a protagonist, Stokes is not unrealistic, but he spends much of the story as a hapless victim, only properly taking control in ending his relationship with Anne, when he\u2019s cowardly and manipulative, unable to fess up to the real reason it\u2019s all coming apart: namely, his dalliance with Aisha. Not atypical male behaviour, by any stretch of the imagination, but it makes for a somewhat un-empathetic central character. On the other hand, it detracts not one jot from the engrossing and progressively compelling nature of the plot and, moreover, shifts focus of our sympathies onto other characters like Aisha - and even Lars. Thus, it becomes a book not about Paul Stokes, but about the people and the issues around him, which, for my money, is the way it should be.In a similar way \u2013 without giving the game away \u2013 come story end, I found myself hankering for some additional coda, but against that, on reflection, I have no idea what more might be said and so I\u2019m obliged to conclude that it delivers the perfect end note.Really, there\u2019s a lot more to be said about Olives, but we would end up peppering the review with spoilers and, trust me, you\u2019re better off giving it a read and allowing it to provoke your own set of thoughts. And provoke them it will.Intelligent and accomplished, this is a well-judged thriller, smouldering at first but growing steadily more explosive and with a distinctive flavour of its own, courtesy of its setting and its author\u2019s informed perspective. And if your understanding of Jordan extends little further than Katie Price, then you could stand to have your horizons broadened.The walls of mainstream publishing are a long way off tumbling down. Meanwhile, there are a great many - too many - independent authors out there, clamouring for your attention. Picking out the good ones can be like finding the best tea leaf in a bag of Tetley.But even if you don\u2019t think this will be your cup of tea, go and have a read of the sample on Amazon.If you like the taste, pop it in your Kindle, sit back and let it brew. Give it time and this is a read that will reward."}, {"userName": "DubaiReader", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2368681-dubaireader", "userReview": "Great local flavour.This book was chosen by our book group because the author will be attending the Emirates International Festival of Literature in March. We were interested in it because it is set in Jordan and covers aspects of Palestinian/Israeli issues, particularly the potential shortage of water in the area.Paul Stokes arrives in Jordan to take up a new job - publishing a magazine for a recently formed Jordanian Ministry. He is helped to find his feet by a colleague, Aisha Dajani, a stunningly beautiful young woman to whom he is instantly drawn.I wasn't sure whether to like Paul, he was a bit of a damp fish at times but he was also under a lot of stress. Caught between the Dajani family and the British Consulate representative, Gerald Lynch, he finds himself at the centre of negotiations for control of water resources that had been taken over by Israeli absorbtion of Jordanian land. The Jordanians needed to retrieve some of this water but this brought with it the alarming potential for causing a water war.Paul becomes very close to Aisha, whose brother Daoud is leading the Jordanian bid. Their family was originally from Palestine and bore both mental and physical scars from their losses since 1948. I enjoyed this view of a fragmented Palestinian family, mostly living away from their home country, but constantly drawn back there to an old olive farm and elderly relatives.My first Kindle book and a good read. A thrilleresque style with local flavour.

It promised to raise so many thorny issues and I wanted to see how the author dealt with them. He tried. The overall story was a good one, it just fell down in the telling. I found the love scenes pedestrian and the narrator neurotic and naive. And, significantly, even though the author claims to have spent 10 years on the book and also credits an editor, the book badly needed editing. From bush league mistakes, like a character having green eyes, but two paragraphs later the same character had blue eyes, to just poorly constructed passages, the writing needed help."}, {"userName": "Ashish Panjabi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8955492-ashish-panjabi", "userReview": "How to walk over an egg-shell without cracking it?

There\u2019s certainly conflict in Olives, Alexander McNabb\u2019s first novel, but the primary concern is water, not oil. Just one of several perspectives one ordinarily doesn\u2019t find in news stories about this part of the world.Paul Stokes is a British journalist off to Amman, Jordan to produce a magazine about natural resources. Things start out poorly right from the airport when our professionally competent but culturally na\u00efve hero comes to the aid of his driver, assaults a policeman, and lands in jail. He gets released but also cornered into giving an uneasy guilty plea that promises to loom over him.Stokes settles in to his work and finds a place to live, with the help of an attractive co-worker, Aisha Dajani. There are sparks between them but cultural differences and Paul\u2019s girl back in England keep romance at bay. Furthermore, her imposing brother makes it clear he doesn\u2019t want Paul messing around with his sister. The rest of her family, though, is more welcoming. His involvement with her family proves to be a complex one because the Dajanis are not only one of the major bidders for a big water development contract, but also purportedly linked to terrorist acts.This puts Paul in a unique and tricky position. He\u2019s privy to key information that might help certain other bids, particularly a British one. He draws pressure from Gerald Lynch, an oppressive and unrelenting embassy official, who\u2019s looking out for those British interests. Paul feels an inherent loyalty to his home country, but it conflicts with his developing empathy toward the Dajanis whom he comes to know in a deeper sense.That, and the matter of his previous arrest, for which he still must face trial\u2014a mere formality as he\u2019d been promised upon entering his guilty plea\u2014throws everything up in the air. He, and the reader, has to question everyone\u2019s actions and words. Is Aisha actually on Paul\u2019s side or betraying him? Could she be behind recent terrorist events? These questions becomes more compelling the closer the two of them become and as the bid selection date approaches. All this suspense accumulates rather well and none of it comes off contrived. And the penultimate and climactic scene at conference at Dead Sea is a winner, very gripping and well dramatized.Olives is an intelligent and entertaining story at its core. And there\u2019s plenty of interesting stuff to read about geographically and politically; the author knows his territory. I got a good taste of a part of the world I have little awareness of. That\u2019s always a draw for me when choosing to read a book, let alone review it.Still, I had some issues with the novel. The opening, other than the initial police altercation, is a bit slow. There\u2019s too much exposition rather than drama in the dialogue (i.e. people speaking about making appointments), and too much narrating of bureaucratic elements that, while well-described, provide little dramatic value.I\u2019m also not convinced Paul is the best one to narrate this story. He\u2019s at the center of it all and therefore the logical choice. But his self-consciousness combined with his na\u00efvet\u00e9 weaken his character and, inevitably, this reader\u2019s ability to care for him. Paul is at times a quintessentially uppity Brit who sounds around 40 and at other times a sophomoric and impetuous twenty-year-old who seems unlikely to land a sophisticated girl like Aisha. The low point for me was in Paul\u2019s handling of his girlfriend, Anne, when she comes to visit him in Amman. The clearly self-serving narration of his actions put me off in how it made her come off\u2014unfairly, in my view\u2014as hateful.For me then, Olives was a mixed experience, but anyone looking for a decent suspense story set in a unique location, ought to enjoy this."}, {"userName": "David King", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5108119-david-king", "userReview": "\u201cOlives \u2013 A Violent Romance\u201d by Alexander McNabb is a suspense novel with a hint of romance. It follows Paul Stokes, a British Journalist who moves to Amman, Jordan to produce a magazine for Jordan\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources. . First on the magazine\u2019s agenda is an upcoming bid for a project addressing Jordan\u2019s water scarcity. Two bidders, a Palestinian company and a British company are the final contenders to resolve Jordan\u2019s water crisis. When Paul missteps with the Jordanian police, the British embassy step into help, but in exchange they want Paul to provide them with economic Intel on the Palestinian bid. However, when Paul enters into a close relationship with Aisha Dajani whose family is fronting the bid and has supposed ties to terrorist activists, he begins to wonder what the right thing to do is.This was quite an entertaining story that paints an interesting and complex picture of life in Jordan. The little pieces of cultural flavour and geographical details that McNabb has embedded in the story really adds to the depth of the story and helps let me as a reader understand more about an area of the world that I have limited knowledge on. In regards to the characters, I have to admit I was worried as I read through the book when it began to appear as if all the Palestinian characters were pretty much terrorism supporting caricatures. Therefore as the story progressed, I began to appreciate that this was just the obvious first impressions of the protagonist and that McNabb was willing to show the complexity and variation between them all. I loved how in the end, no one was really who they appeared to be which ensured the suspense levels of the novel were kept high.The only down side for me was in regards to Paul himself. I understand why he was chosen to narrate the story as he is the central characters, but I was never able to fully understand him. At times, he came across as a serious middle aged guy who knew his stuff and then the next moment he came across as a rather na\u00efve and impetuous twenty year old. It was quite frustrating and contrasted badly with some of the other characters who seemed so much more dynamic and interesting.Overall, \u201cOlives \u2013 A Violent Romance\u201d is an enjoyable enough story that tries to highlight the many complex issues of Jordan, its people and the Middle East as a whole. If only the main character was a more interesting character then I may have enjoyed it even more."}, {"userName": "Lena Cox", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6852796-lena-cox", "userReview": "In Olives, Paul Stokes signs on with his British company The Media Group to create a magazine for Jordan\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources.

The snooping and the reporting bring Paul into a close relationship with Aisha Dajani. Aisha\u2019s family is wealthy Palestinians with business connections to people un-favored by the British ministry for their terrorist potential and they also own the company competing with the Brits for the water project.Paul\u2019s falling in love with Aisha, but, he\u2019s unsure whether he can trust her? His embassy connections whisper frequently in his ear that the Dajanis are dangerous. His relationship with Aisha ebbs and flows on wire-thin trust as Paul struggles to determine whether her family is truly terrorists and whether they are behind the recent bombings in Haifa and at the border.Paul finds that nothing is transparent in the Arab world. Jordan is a society where citizens have traded civil liberties for protection from terrorists, and everyone is a suspect. With truth constantly blurred by history and events he\u2019s unfamiliar with, Paul surrenders to his suspicions with disastrous consequences.Olives paces well, except for the parts bogged down in the minutiae of the magazine. Facts about Jordan such as the weekends being Friday and Saturday and dating customs add cultural flavor to the story. Single quotation marks instead of doubles pepper the text, easy to skim over, but obnoxious nevertheless.Learning about the Arab world through McNabb\u2019s fictional story sculpts a palpable reality, creating empathy and connection with the humanity of the Middle East. ~review originally posted at PageCravings.com"}, {"userName": "Ashu", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9983928-ashu", "userReview": "The book starts with the protagonist finding himself at the verge of being stripped of his freedom in a foreign land- A scary feeling which stalks him throughout the course of the story and makes him think and do things that he normally wouldn\u2019t have. Now magnify this feeling manifold and apply it to the citizens of a city or a country. Would you behave normally if your homeland was snatched away from you, or if you were being threatened with a possibility of that happening? Would you act normally, see reason, think logically? Easier said than done- right? And that is the central theme of this bitter \u2013 sweet love story set in the backdrop of the troubled Middle East region.I cannot comment on the description of facts related to the politics and culture in the book because one, I am not an expert on it and secondly, and more importantly, it doesn\u2019t matter to me as a reader. What matters is that the writer has used delightful descriptions of the warm Arab hospitality and the natural beauty of the region to forward his narrative in a captivating manner- such that it makes you want to visit those places and sit with and share some coffee and some conversation with the characters in the bookThe writer does well to provide some witty relief during the course of an otherwise tragic tale. Now \u201cwasta\u201d might sound an alien concept to the westerners but coming from South Asia myself I chuckled with familiarity each time it was mentioned, because in my part of the world too, it's \u201cnot what you know but who you know\u2019 that matters. I could also totally relate to the British protagonist because the writer has created him as very human and believable. As an outsider Paul Stokes tries to be objective and understand both points of view in the strife but when his thinking is clouded by a threat to his own freedom he loses objectivity followed by trust, and that too in someone whom he loves.The story is fast paced, hard to put down, and really builds up well to an almost nail biting finish.

I'm glad he did because this is not a book I would have selected to read. I almost didn't even agree to read it.I understand this book was rejected by multiple traditional publishing houses and I can only say that it can't possibly be due to the writing. The writing is polished and the story is well told.Paul Stokes is a journalist sent by his employer to work in Jordan. The poor fellow is over his head almost from the minute he arrives in the country. The British intelligence agent, Gerald Lynch, has him wrapped up and turned around so many times that Paul wouldn't know if he met himself coming around a corner. (I was also amused that the intelligence agent's name is Lynch, as the movie \"The A-Team\" uses the name Lynch for the ubiquitous CIA agent.) Paul is swimming in some deep waters and in this world of turmoil, intrigue and deceit, he finds it difficult to discern friend from enemy, truth from lies and half lies. He thinks he knows who he can't trust, but then isn't even sure of that. He knows who he wants to trust, as he falls in love with Aisha.I was slowly sucked into this story, just as Paul is slowly sucked deeper and deeper into the intrigue and turmoil that surrounds this region of the world. I kept urging him (in my head, of course!) to get out while he still could, get out before he was too deeply enmeshed in the sticky mess. I enjoyed the layers of complexity and the characters, as well as the education on water rights in this region. There are a lot of lessons delivered in this book, but they're subtle and layered into the story, not slammed into the reader with a sledgehammer. This is a story with a lot of conflicts, not all of them obvious.I was captivated right up to the rather surprising ending.

The ideas and plot that McNabb puts together is truly thought provoking and recently, having read a few novels dealing with similar political/social issues in the Middle East, I am beginning to find myself more au fait with some of the terms and political knowledge required to get the most from novels set in the area. I felt I got the most from Olives.Despite feeling no particular empathy for the protagonist and narrator, Paul, I enjoyed his story immensely as he becomes embroiled in a political battle in Jordan. Combining elements of a generic, yet appealing, love story between Paul and his Palestinian lover Aisha, a political thriller and wrapping it all up in the package of an extremely dangerous war-torn climate and you\u2019re onto a winner. I felt the relationships McNabb builds between his characters are particularly well built and I believed every second of the action.The only slight misgiving I had was the frequent references to alcohol and the number of times the characters were seriously intoxicated. I don\u2019t know much about Jordanian culture, but the little I do know leads me to believe that alcohol abuse and misuse is considered seriously shameful and the majority of people in the area wouldn\u2019t culturally be involved in heavy drinking. This is the only element of the novel that didn\u2019t sit right for me, but I could perceivably be wrong.A short and pacey read, from the beginning it\u2019s hard to see how Paul will get out of the mess that\u2019s happening around him, especially if he is determined to keep Aisha at his side.

Really well written."}], "description": "When Paul Stokes runs out of choices, his only path is betrayal. The fragile peace is holding. Behind the scenes, the Israelis are competing for dwindling water resources as Jordan and Palestine face drought. Daoud Dajani has the solution to Jordan\u2019s water problems and is bidding against the British for the privatisation of Jordan\u2019s water network. When journalist Paul Stokes befriends Dajani\u2019s sister, Aisha, British intelligence agent Gerald Lynch realises Paul offers access to Dajani - the man threatening to drain Israel\u2019s water supply and snatch the bid from the British. Blackmailed by Lynch into spying on Dajani, his movements seemingly linked to a series of bombings, Paul is pitched into a terrifying fight for survival that will force him to betray everyone around him. Even the woman he loves. Olives explores love in conflict, the pull of home set against the excitement of the new and a people trying to live alongside the conflict we see on television, the human stories behind glib media coverage that reduces the ebb and flow of existence to a few throwaway catchphrases. Forced to spy for his country, Paul finds himself embroiled in a struggle for survival between good and evil where the people he wants to see as the good guys are worse than he could ever have imagined.", "title": "Olives: A Violent Romance", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13050921-olives", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327919109l/13050921.jpg", "reviews": 23, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5329259.Alexander_McNabb", "name": "Alexander McNabb"}], "type": ["Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13050921-olives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13185382-olives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16132775-beirut", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18749436-shemlan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26886818-a-decent-bomber", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16275719-space", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29224291-birdkill"]}
