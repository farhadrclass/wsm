I'm even more troubled by the fact that I haven't seen anyone else bring up what bothers me about this play.Yes, it's well written -- that is, the dialogue is expertly handled. There are truly beautiful passages, such as this one:I came into this village like a bridegroom to his beloved, bearing gifts of high religion; the very crowns of holy law I brought, and what I touched with my bright confidence, it died; and where I turned the eye of my great faith, blood flowed up.But when it comes down to it, this is yet another piece of literature in which men HAVE sex, but women ARE sex. Men have complex lives and motivations; women's lives center entirely around men, specifically around attraction to and dependence on men.Miller brought up the very real issues of property and land-lust that dominated the real trial. Why did he insist on sexualizing the girls involved -- to the point where he had to make one of the girls several years older than she really was? The terrifying thing about what the real \"afflicted girls\" did was that it comes across as a sort of motiveless malignity. They were lashing out at their own repressive society, possibly egged on by parents who wanted to use them as weapons in battles over land. That's fascinating. Instead, Miller decided to say that the girls really were engaged in \"witchcraft\" -- or at least in stereotypical witch behavior: dancing naked in the woods at night, concocting evil brews. He insists that \"there are accounts of similar klatches in Europe, where the daughters of the towns would assemble at night and, sometimes with fetishes, sometimes with a selected young man, give themselves to love, with some bastardly results.\" He doesn't seem to realize that these \"accounts\" are all from accusers or from the tortured accused. He really seems to believe that this went on.Then there's the main character: John Proctor. Can't imagine why I have a hard time sympathizing with him.Imagine you know a family with three young children. They hire an au pair. The dad has an affair with this young woman -- hardly older than a girl, a virgin, completely inexperienced in life or love. The mom suspects that something is going on and fires her, but stays with the dad. The dad bitches at the mom for always giving him that look and not acting happy to see him all the time. The mom breaks down crying and admits that her cold behavior must have pushed him into having an affair. The dad also bitches at the au pair, because this affair got her hopes up and she really thought it meant something to him the way it did to her. He screams at this teenager (who was lucky not to get pregnant, btw, since they didn't use birth control) to get over it, already -- he's married and he's staying that way.If you heard about something like this -- maybe it happened to a friend of yours, maybe you read about it in a novel -- would your first sympathy really be with the poor, tormented man who has to put up with all these women acting like he owes them something?Why has no one pointed out how creepy it is that John Proctor is genuinely supposed to be a sympathetic character, and Abigail is a monster?And by the way -- contrary to what Miller says in his afterword, the only \"legend\" that \"has it that Abigail turned up later as a prostitute in Boston\" is the one he started by writing this. Sorry. I'm not in 9th grade, and I still have problems with this modern classic. I understand why it is one; but I just can't give it the three \"I liked it!\" stars."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "This is a magnificent play about what happens when hysteria takes over a society, and evil people gain access to the levers of power; something, alas, which happens all too frequently.The focus of the story is John Proctor's struggle to redeem himself from the horrible guilt he has suffered since committing adultery with Abigail. This is indeed very moving. But, for some reason, the part I think of most often is a detail concerning one of the minor characters, Giles Corey, who dies offstage halfway through. Giles is one of many citizens falsely accused of witchcraft by Abigail and those who are exploiting her. He is an impossible situation; irrespective of whether he pleads guilty or innocent, he is doomed. But Giles has a long history of litigation, and knows the law very well. He simply refuses to enter any plea at all.They fetch huge stones, and lay them on top of him, to force him to say something. But the only words he ever utters are \"More weight\". And so he dies uncompromised, and his farm is inherited by his children. The person telling the story finishes, and adds, \"It was a fearsome man, Giles Corey\"._______________________________________I just looked it up on Wikipedia; apparently it's all true.

Soon, any criticism of India was seen as unpatriotic and traitorous. The JNU, a leftist stronghold and a thorn in the flesh of the Hindu Right-Wing government at the centre, was termed a positive hotbed of crime and vice and a recruiting ground for terrorists. Many a Muslim, unless he wore his love of India on his sleeve for all to see, was branded a Pakistani agent - the refusal to say \"Bharat Mata ki Jai\" (Victory to Mother India) resulted in intimidation and even physical abuse in many places.What is interesting about this phenomena is that it is not only an orchestrated move from the right-wingers: many Indians are genuinely frightened that Pakistanis are in our midst, bent on destroying the country with the support of the leftists. There is a paranoia that is being exploited by the political vultures.I am frightened by how much this resembles McCarthyism - the madness that gripped America from 1950 to 56 and destroyed many lives and careers. Wikipedia says During the McCarthy era, thousands of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was often greatly exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment and/or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that were later declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute.It seems that human beings don't learn anything from history, and therefore keep on repeating it.But then, according to Arthur Miller, the Red Scare of the fifties was a repeat of a much darker event from the seventeenth century - the Salem Witch Trails. He wrote this play in 1953 to remind fellow citizens on how mass hysteria can engulf a society and demolish civilisation.in 1692, a group of children in Salem were afflicted by diseases which showed classical symptoms of hysteria, but were soon diagnosed as demonic possession by the church authorities based partly on the children's own confused utterings. Soon, people were being denounced left and right as witches and executed. Malicious people with revenge and other material interests (such as grabbing a condemned person's property) seems to have contributed enthusiastically to the madness. As John Proctor, an accused, says in the play: Is the accuser always holy now? Were they born this morning as clean as God's fingers? I'll tell you what's walking Salem - vengeance is walking Salem. We are what we always were in Salem, but now the little crazy children are jangling the keys of the kingdom, and common vengeance writes the law!These words are chillingly applicable to both McCarthyism and the events I quoted at the beginning: common vengeance is writing the law. Anybody can be accused - proof is not required, accusation is proof enough. Any kind of fair dealing and neutrality would be seen as potential collaboration, so the safest thing is to side with the accusers. Verily, the term \"witch hunt\" has entered the English language with strong credentials.A fire, a fire is burning! I hear the boot of Lucifer, I see his filthy face! And it is my face, and yours, Danforth! For them that quail to bring men out of ignorance, as I have quailed, and as you quail now when you know in all your black hearts that this be fraud - God damns our kind especially, and we will burn, we will burn together!We will. We, the conformists who let the madness continue to save our own islands of comfort in this burning sea of paranoid anger. ----------------------------------From the Oxford English Dictionary:1 A ceramic or metal container in which metals or other substances may be melted or subjected to very high temperatures1.1 A situation of severe trial, or in which different elements interact, leading to the creation of something newIt is evident that Arthur Miller put a lot of thought into the naming of his play. He wanted to emphasise the heat and the fire, the hatred and the horror: at the same time, he also wanted to point out that after the melting process, a refined product would come out. Times of extreme tribulations in society are usually followed by a period of rejuvenation.The playwright takes a lot of liberty with history to make his point. This is nothing new: Shakespeare regularly did this, it seems. So in the play, the historical 11-year-old Abigail Williams, the niece of the puritan minister Reverend Parris of Salem is transformed into an oversexed teen. She has seduced John Proctor in whose house she was working as a servant, and has apparently tried out some black magic to kill his wife. During such a magic session in the woods with Tituba and other kids, the Parris's Caribbean servant, they are surprised by the minister. Betty, the minister's young daughter, falls into a dead faint and cannot be cured by the doctor. Abigail immediately shouts witchcraft, and others join in; and soon the subterfuge becomes mass hysteria.Miller has chosen John Proctor to be tragic hero of this play; haunted by guilt at his infidelity (even more so because his wife forgives it), he seeks punishment for himself, at least inside his soul. His torment is further compounded as his wife Elizabeth is denounced as a witch by Abigail. To make matters worse, there is the cunning Thomas Putnam, abetting the hysteria to settle scores against old opponents and grab their lands. As the roller-coaster of paranoia rolls on towards its destructive end, Proctor himself is sentenced to hang for witchcraft but Elizabeth ironically escapes as she is pregnant.At the insistence of friends and a few sane people who want to stop the madness, John Proctor confesses at the last moment: however, he immediately sees the falsehood and cowardice in it and immediately withdraws it.\nHALE: Man, you will hang! You cannot!PROCTOR[his eyes full of tears]: I can. And there's your first marvel, that I can. You have made your magic now, for now I do think I see some shred of goodness in John Proctor. Not enough to weave a banner with, but white enough to keep it from such dogs.\nYes indeed: the courage to stand up for what one thinks is right is ultimately the refined product that comes out of the crucible.----------------------------------The character who impressed me most in the story was Giles Corey, an 81-year-old man who refused to confess or refute when faced with charges of witchcraft. He was subjected to a horrendous form of torture called \"pressing\" (thankfully it occurs offstage in the play) where more and more rocks were piled on his chest in an effort to make him speak. Giles endured this for a whole two days before he died - his last words, reportedly, were \"more weight\".

Miller is brilliant, I acknowledge it. He bring suspense, timing and charisma in everything he does. But when this is about an episode from our history over 250 years before the play was written, I expected something a bit different / stronger. Too many scenes were too dry for me.So many schools put this play on as a high school production. Even in colleges sometimes. I was tempted to look for it on Broadway... I mean, I do live in NYC. Why wouldn't I go try it out? Really... I blame myself here.Characters are great. You do feel strong emotions towards them. I think what I wanted more of... was the mysterious air surrounding those deemed a witch. There are some scenes where it's almost there for me, but ultimately... I wanted more. I should probably give it another chance... it's been almost 25 years.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

I appreciated Arthur Miller bringing attention to the Salem Witch Trials and anti-communist hysteria. I hated how he treated Abigail and the other female characters in this story as crazy and antagonizing. Yes, Abigail's actions posed major problems - but Miller portrays John Proctor, the man who has illicit sex with her, as a martyr. Miller grants the men in this play complexity and autonomy; he relegates women to the role of one-dimensional witches. You could blame my feminist side, but you could also blame Miller for failing to seize an opportunity to question the patriarchal standards so salient in Salem.A good, emotional read, with solid writing and a compelling plot.

The amazing thing is how well the play works on its own. Even if you know nothing of McCarthyism, you will still be moved by the plight of a small Massachusetts village wracked by lies, spitefulness and cruelty. \n\"I saw Sarah Good with the Devil! I saw Goody Osburn with the Devil! I saw Bridget Bishop with the Devil!\"\nIn one of the most chilling scenes, young girls begin rattling off the names of seemingly every woman in the village. That the townsfolk would take the word of a few of teenagers seems hard to believe, but darker forces were at work here. Men more concerned with their reputations and the chance to fill their coffers than they were fearful of actual witchcraft were in charge, and they grabbed the opportunity to settle old grudges and steal a neighbor's land. The girls, many stinging from slights both real and imagined, reveled in their newly found power to wreak vengeance against their former mistresses and employers. This is truly a depiction of humanity at its worst.When John Hale, a visiting reverend who has been charged with investigating Salem's little witch problem, declares: \n\"No man may longer doubt the powers of the dark are gathered in monstrous attack upon this village.\"\n - he has no idea how right he is, though this darkness has nothing to do with the supernatural. It seems we are always willing to believe the worst in others; that they might be witches, or Communists or terrorists. It seems that no matter what the evidence, we continue to believe what we want to believe.If nothing else, this play serves as a cautionary tale.

The stage for this particular drama to unfold:A group of denizens of a small rural town are holed up in a grocery store, enveloped by a mysterious, impossibly thick mist. To venture outside is inadvisable, since some of them have already been lost to the unfriendly creatures lurking outside. No one knows what is going on, or whether their loved ones are still alive. Fear, despair and panic reign supreme. Soon, a feverish cult\u2013 stoked by an evangelical, unbearably sanctimonious zealot, gathering ever more disciples around her \u2013 takes shape, and the search for a scapegoat is well underway. After two soldiers have hanged themselves, a third \u2013 the last one of their group - confesses under pressure that he and his compatriots served on a military base where clandestine experiments were conducted in order to attempt communication with other dimensions. Put simply: It all went to hell in a handbasket. A portal opened up, which spewed forth the strange mist and a horde of creatures, an outcome which could very well spell doom for the entire world. And thus, the scapegoat has been found, and \u2013 after enthusiastic prompting by their cult leader - is promptly and under a loud clamouring sacrificed by the mob. A butcher, striding towards him like an automaton, viciously stabs the soldier multiple times in the lower abdomen, after which he \u2013 still alive- is thrown out of the store, to be offered up to the creatures outside. He pleads to be let back in, but is faced by the door, which will never again be opened up to him. Something grabs him, and pulls him into the mist. The real monsters are still inside, looking on.When I saw the film at its release, this scene absolutely terrified me. Mob mentality (the willing surrendering of one\u2019s own individual morality or sovereignty) to me has always been the ugliest aspect of the human psyche. Whenever I see it occur, a deep revulsion fills my being. Yet, I am also eternally fascinated by it. To be able to arrive at some kind of \u2013 admittedly uneasy - peace with this unpleasant reality, and more importantly to not be swept up by it when it comes, to face it head on and not budge an inch, is something that has kept me preoccupied for many years. It\u2019s one of the greatest moral responsibilities any human could ever confront.While radically different in its approach to The Mist  in its portrayal of the inevitable fallout of hysterical groupthink, Arthur Miller\u2019s The Crucible does leave one reeling for its sheer visceral power. None of the many examples of man\u2019s inhumanity to man during the infamous Salem witch trials are directly shown, only briefly commented on, yet the paranoia and suffocating atmosphere are captured perfectly. Miller has a great ear for authentic dialogue, and deftly uses the idiom of 17th century English to craft a supreme human drama which elicits both sadness and righteous indignation. A play which, I imagine, would be even more brutal to witness at a live performance. Essential in whichever way you opt to experience it."}, {"userName": "pinkgal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7577-pinkgal", "userReview": "It was one of those rare books that are forced upon you and then when you read it, you fall.

Miller wrote this in the early 1950s as a response to the dangers that Joseph McCarthy's actions toward declaring that people were \"Communists\" and how this is a case of history repeating itself a little more than 250 years later. In the late 1690s, young girls were making accusations toward who they believed were witches that resulted in the hanging of nineteen people and the pressing of one. Back in that day, witchcraft was viewed as \"business with the devil.\"The issues that is timeless, whether it be during the Salem Witch Trials, McCarthyism, or anywhere beyond that point is the fact that everyone would have it in them to serve out what they feel to be God's will, whether they be reverends that see themselves as a religious authority, judges that see themselves as a legal authority, or young girls that feel they are making something of themselves by doing what they feel is God's duty. This play brought out a lot of responses, from anger to enlightenment. I felt greatly sympathetic toward John Proctor, who was a flawed man, but one that wanted to live and let live and anger toward multiple characters, but especially Abigail, the leader among the girls, in how she manipulated and blackmailed everyone she came across.Arthur Miller gave life to each of the characters (who were or were based on real people) in this play to the point that you are bound to feel something toward each of them and either care, cringe, or get that feeling you want to punch them in the face. It certainly made its mark in that respect. While there were things that were intentionally altered, such as the girls being made a bit older in order to make John Proctor's affair with Abigail look a bit more logical, I still feel that this novel made a legitimate point in what it was attempting to get at.I read The Crucible back in high school and committed an entire unit to it. I remember watching the 1996 film adaptation with Daniel Day Lewis as John Proctor, Winona Ryder as Abigail Williams, and Paul Scofield as Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth (who I felt was the standout role in the film). We also had to create a comic book based on The Crucible, which was fun.

I know we all have our own morals, but the conflicting choices Proctor went through what suited him, and made him. Abigail is so good at being someone you would want to be on the same side with. She is convincing. I just love her. I just hate her. I must be with the devil. SEE! SHE HAS ALREADY CAPTURED ME WITHIN HER TALONS. But really, I hate her morals. Anyway, what I really wanted to talk about was John Proctor and Abigail\u2019s relationship. At the start, I hate to say, I was looking forward to their relationship. I know undoubtedly that cheating on your partner is wrong, but it seems to be yearned for in books. We want to see some forbidden love, some slave girl fall for her handsome young master. But not when that girl is a total BITCH. Not even Ely could outrun that whore. The only person I truly liked for every bone in their body was Elizabeth Proctor. Reverend Hale was interesting but I didn\u2019t understand how he was not influenced by society when he walked out of that court. The court must have been such a great pressure on him.Plot: I thought the plot was attention grabbing. I didn\u2019t know that the outcome would be the outcome it was, and that made it better. I liked that he was not the hero, but neither was the villain. I liked that none of the characters were heroes and villains, but some just tasting darkness and others being overwhelmed by other. What I didn\u2019t understand was why if u confessed that you were with the devil, and they didn\u2019t hang u. Salem was so corrupted. It was slightly more corrupted than now. Some would say otherwise."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "About as perfect an allegory as can be created \u2013 a story about a witch hunt meant to be an extended metaphor for - a witch hunt.\u201cYou are pulling down heaven and raising up a whore\u201d\u00a0Arthur Miller\u2019s brilliant 1953 play about the infamous Salem witch trials is also a scathing indictment of the McCarthy communist hearings of the early 50s and how hysteria \u2013 whether theocratic or jingoistic / political \u2013 can lead to nasty results.\u201cLife, woman, life is God's most precious gift; no principle, however glorious, may justify the taking of it.\u201d\u00a0Miller\u2019s fictionalized account of the trials brings to life some of the themes present in the actual Salem trials as well as his contemporary McCarthy hearings such as justice, fairness, and the rule of law.

What makes it even more shuttering, is the fact that it has always been relevant to any era, because it represents the fear in front of something we cannot understand, and the need to create witch-hunts in order to cover up our own faults as human beings and as members of our socities. John Proctor is the Everyman, he stands for every human being that is -rightfully- afraid in front of the face of an inhuman justice, being torchured over imaginary faults and mistakes. What elevates him to greatness, though, is his fight with himself and the way he wins it over, desperately battling to preserve his honour, his ''name''. ''I have given you my soul, leave me my name!'' is the ultimate cry for respect and understanding in a society that has lost all elements of compassion. I wonder, is our time so very different than those by-gone eras? Are we more understanding now, more open-minded? Do we find the respect we ask for? Do we earn it?

Miller set the piece in Salem, MA during the infamous 1692 witch trials. The play itself is divided into four acts and features the struggles individual villagers face as they are confronted with a hellish choice between hanging for witchcraft or falsely confessing, a choice which leads to the death of others.The action is driven by a posse of teenage girls. In order to escape punishment for dancing in the woods (a verboten activity for Puritans) the girls begin accusing community members of bewitching them. Their fever catches on and burns up the entire village as reason, justice, and mercy are swept away in the raging tide of repression, revenge, and corruption. The play makes the adjective puritannical take on a whole new meaning."}, {"userName": "Emir Iba\u00f1ez", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49915953-emir-iba-ez", "userReview": "Es tenebrosa, explora partes de la naturaleza humana que te dejan pasmado... pero lo que m\u00e1s miedo da es que, a pesar de estar escrito a modo de obra de teatro, no es una obra de ficci\u00f3n."}, {"userName": "Kierstin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/609905-kierstin", "userReview": "\"Bleh.

Schools often make kids read literature that is too mature for their age group, and I have come to find that even a single year's difference can make or break one's comprehension of the book. Now I can say that I appreciate the play for what it is, and I especially admire John Proctor's courage portrayed throughout. He made an awful mistake but had the courage to confess and make a stand against his wrongdoing, even if it resulted in his paying the price for it. That spoke novels to me.It wasn't a favorite read of mine, but Miller's message of self-confession and the precarious state of society were interesting and thought-provoking nevertheless."}, {"userName": "Azumi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14024451-azumi", "userReview": "Describe perfectamente el fanatismo, la estupidez general y el histerismo colectivo, sacando lo malo de toda colectividad, describiendo como se va haciendo una bola de mentiras, odios y tonter\u00edas cada vez m\u00e1s grande.

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \"witch-hunts\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, \"Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.\"WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.", "title": "The Crucible", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17250.The_Crucible", "average": 3.56, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1447764813l/17250.jpg", "reviews": 5982, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8120.Arthur_Miller", "name": "Arthur Miller"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2772778.Christopher_Bigsby", "name": "Christopher Bigsby"}], "type": ["Classics", "Plays", "Fiction", "Historical", "Drama"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17250.The_Crucible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/298247.The_Crucible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6916158", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9710564-las-brujas-de-salem", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/946552.The_Crucible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425112.The_Crucible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28251242-the-crucible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74054.Las_brujas_de_Salem_El_crisol", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25576241-las-brujas-de-salem-y-el-crisol", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12898.Death_of_a_Salesman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179142.All_My_Sons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/847168.A_View_from_the_Bridge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250165.After_the_Fall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437965.A_View_from_the_Bridge_All_My_Sons"]}
