What's interesting about it is how the main character deals with some moral dilemmas associated with the repeating days in different ways that are realistic.

There is a reason we enjoy time travel/ magical realism/what-if-I-could-do-that-day-over books, because it is something we all dream of being able to do. Dorian Cirrone takes that concept and brings it to a middle grade story (I don't think that's been done before.) It makes you think, feel, and learn, and it is all hidden in a fantastical, entertaining story about one little girl, on one summer day, that keeps repeating and repeating. It is the ultimate Kabbalistic journey..but shh, don't tell the kids that. Just let them enjoy the ride."}, {"userName": "Debbie Reed Fischer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/934895-debbie-reed-fischer", "userReview": "Be careful what you wish for . . .

Haleigh wants nothing more than a never ending summer but we have to be careful what we wish for. Living the same day over and over seems fun at first but then she realizes she wants to see what the future holds. Will she and Kevin be able to stop what seems like an endless time loop? This book did not seem realistic, the conversations are staged and the characters are very immature for middle school students. It did not start to get even a little interesting until the end, and it was very repetitive. In conclusion this book was slow and I would not recommend it. I would recommend this book to a younger audience, elementary students would enjoy it.EL - ADVISABLE, MS - OPTIONAL 8th Grade Student Reviewer SKhttp://kissthebook.blogspot.com/2017/..."}, {"userName": "Shannon Hitchcock", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2308926-shannon-hitchcock", "userReview": "Haleigh wishes summer would never end. She paints a picture with that longing in her heart and suddenly she's in a time loop, reliving the last day of summer vacation over and over. There are pluses and minuses to Haleigh's time loop. On the positive side, G-Mags, (her best friend's grandmother), will never die. On the negative side, Haleigh won't get to meet her new brother or sister, (Haleigh's mom is pregnant). There are lots of other negatives too, like eating the same food every day and doing the same activities. Author, Dorian Cirrone, has written this novel like a mystery, with Haleigh and Kevin trying to determine how to break the spell and return to normal.

The next morning, however, Kevin isn't sleeping on Haleigh's couch, and her mother denies that anything like that happened. It's still the last day of summer vacation, and Haleigh has to figure out how that happened. She narrows it down to a paint kit, and a picture that she has made, wishing for things to continue as they are. After the day continues for a long time (at one points, 60 days was the figure mentioned), Haleigh is tired of it. She finds out that there are things in the future that she would like to see happen, and is determined to find out where the paintbox came from and how to reverse the wish, even if it means things change. Strengths: Losing a grandparent is a reasonable sad thing to have in a middle grade novel, and Haleigh does have very supportive parents, as does Kevin. This is convincingly told, and the time loop/wish fulfillment feature works well. Weaknesses: The time loop isn't exactly fresh-- Christmas Every Day by William Dean Howells was published in 1892, and there are movies like Groundhog Day that cover the same idea. However, I can't think of any time loop novels in my library, and my students may not be familiar with the trope. What I really think: Debating. This is closer to the magical realism books that do decently well in my library than to the time travel books I like, but the cover isn't great and it might be a bit of a hard sell."}, {"userName": "Kerry Cerra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2927038-kerry-cerra", "userReview": "If the cover alone doesn't draw you to this sweet middle-grade book, Haleigh's story surely will. Haleigh doesn't do well with change, and as the best summer of her life comes to an end, she spends her last night at the Jersey shore painting a picture of all the fun she and her new best friend Kevin have had over the previous months: building sand structures, making and watching movies together, hanging out with Kevin's grandmother, G-Mags, and having free-run of the boardwalk. With the oil paint drying on the most perfect picture she's ever painted, Haleigh wishes summer didn't have to end. But she never expected her wish would actually come true. I'm pretty sure none of us have ever experienced a time-loop before, but I'm confident anyone who reads this book will relate to Haleigh's uncertainty of the future, her desire to keep things as they are, and ultimately her realization that fear shouldn't keep one from truly living.I loved this book and hope you will, too."}, {"userName": "Yapha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3722795-yapha", "userReview": "Haleigh has had an amazing summer at the Jersey Shore.

When she finds a box of magic paints in her backpack, she makes a wish that she could have a \"mulligan,\" a do-over to relive the last day again.

The main character, Haleigh, doesn't want her last day of summer to end with her friend, Kevin. She paints her day onto a canvass and makes a wish, but she doesn't know the paints are magic. Haleigh ends up in a time loop and repeats the same day every day! She must figure out who gave her the magic paints and how to stop the loop so time can go forward. The book also addresses important, substantive issues such as friendship and loss. THE FIRST LAST DAY feels like a classic!
