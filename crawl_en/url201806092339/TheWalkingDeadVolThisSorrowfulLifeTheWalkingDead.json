And that\u2019s because it\u2019s completely true. This one descended even further into depravity. In the past we\u2019ve had lots of violence, mutilation, torture and even rape. These have become almost casual things, trademarks of everyday life. In this crazy world this stuff happens every day. I hesitate to say that it\u2019s normal, it\u2019s not normal, but in a zombie apocalypse anything goes. There are no rules anymore. There\u2019s nobody to tell you that you are wrong and to punish you for your deeds. All that\u2019s left is opportunity and those who are willing to take advantage of others. Simply put, they will take what they want when they want it. There\u2019s very little to stop them. I\u2019m of course referring to the Governor and his foolish following.And Michonne, his latest victim, didn\u2019t let herself be defeated by such a brutaliser. What she did to the Governor was brutal poetic justice. The worrying thing about the whole situation is how easily she survives. She\u2019s obviously a strong woman, but such a decree of fortitude could only have been born from a life of hardship. Before the apocalypse, she must have had a real hard life; it\u2019s the only logical reasoning for how easily she picks herself back up. There\u2019s a lot more to her character, and I hope eventually we will find out exactly what keeps her going.

Rape tales, tales of torturing women, tales of violence against women have been told for years with graphic detail. Many of these tales have been saying (either explicitly or implicitly) that these brands of violence are wrong or even evil, but many of them still offer up the vision of this violence to illustrate the wrongs and evils.Now a redress has come, and we have Lisbeth Salander avenging herself on her tormentor, and The Walking Dead's Michonne brutalising her brutalizer. It's the latter I am concerned with here. The extended sequence of Michonne's revenge is, perhaps, the most disturbing thing I've seen since I read the Habitrail sequence in American Psycho (though it is still a shade behind). It is an illustrated torture session with most of the tortures happening right there in front of us, happening \"on camera.\" There is a genital mutilation, an anal rape with a spoon, power drilling, pliers ripping parts away from the Governor's body, an amputation and cauterization, a half-blinding. It is up there with the killings of Patrick Bateman for sheer brutality, but it was perpetrated by a woman wronged, not a man doing the wronging, and it would be awfully hard to suggest (and I am not) that the Governor didn't deserve what he got. But even though the Governor deserved it, I am not sure that showing us images of Michonne's vengeance does anything to really redress the injustices of the past. I imagine that is the reason we accept such images today -- the hope or possibility of redress. I am not angry at Kirkman for showing Michonne's vengeance. I don't even really know what I am trying to say. I think American Psycho is a masterpiece, and I appreciate Stieg Larsson's books, and what Michonne did is precisely what her character -- as offered to us -- would do. And I would defend any author's right to self-expression, even in cases of brutality. I guess it is just that what I got from Robert Kirkman here was totally unexpected. I expected ultra-violence on Zombies, former humans shambling about in a state of perma-rot, not ultra-violence on humans by humans. But then why should I be okay watching brutal fantasy creatures be brutalized and not brutal humans being brutalized? Where th fuck do we draw the line? Can any violence stop so long as any violence is accepted and acceptable? Or do we need violence like we need air?I dunno what to say about the brutality. I am just rambling now, so it's time to stop. But I will read on, even though the series has taken a much more serious turn than I ever expected. How on earth will they incorporate this into the TV series? I'm guessing it will all be off screen -- or most of it will."}, {"userName": "Coreen  (AsThePlotThickens)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43075248-coreen-astheplotthickens", "userReview": "\"we just need to be sure that when they get here.

Every time I see or hear the phrase \"or die trying\" (such as the one in the description for this volume) I can't help but think of The Boondocks and how the show makes fun of 50 Cent. Observe: \"Mumble mumble something. ...Or die tryin'.\" Not that that really has anything to do with this volume. It's just early, I haven't had coffee yet, and reading the description of this book to refresh my memory as to what happened (from sooooooooooooooo long ago - aka: last night), and it made me think of that. Because random. Anywho... My oh my, was there some shit goin' down last night! I guess I got my wish from Volume 5, after all. Who'da thunk it?? It almost didn't happen. Almost. But Michonne is not one to fuck with, indeed. She will see your abuse, endure it, and when her time comes, she will FUCK. YOU. UP. With women, people like Michonne, it's better just to kill them than to try to break them. You can't break them, you'll only piss them off. And then they will rain fucking destruction down upon you. It was awesome. It was actually a little humorous as well. Her little quips were, anyway. But the images... the EYE... That wasn't. And then to find out that they'd been betrayed? I never saw that coming. I'm still not sure how I feel about it. I trusted. I assumed the best. I still did, even at the end, even though I knew that the betrayal was real - I just assumed that the betrayer had done it for his own reasons, not on orders. It's a gray area there. But, I can't say that I'd come to a different conclusion than Grimes did in the end. One has to be prepared. Oh, shit.

But help is on hand as one of the Governor\u2019s guards helps them escape and head back home to the prison. Will they all make it back \u2013 or die trying? I really, really enjoyed this one! I flew through it in one sitting, and it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 but the pages couldn\u2019t turn fast enough. Everything from the lead-up to the breakout, the escape through the forest, the drive back to the prison, and finding out what\u2019s happened there since they\u2019ve been gone \u2013 wow, what a journey! Excitement and danger were there at every turn and made for a genuinely thrilling read. Robert Kirkman may not be much of a writer but he\u2019s a really excellent storyteller. That said, it wouldn\u2019t be The Walking Dead without some questionable scenes thrown in to unnerve the reader. Last volume it was the repeated rape of Michonne \u2013 thankfully Kirkman and Charlie Adlard decided against showing us those images \u2013 and in this volume it\u2019s a very graphic torture scene as Michonne gets her own back on the Governor. While the Governor got what he deserved, did we really have to see every little thing Michonne did to him? I\u2019m guessing Kirkman/Adlard are fans of the Saw series and were doing their own version of that in this book, but it\u2019s more than a bit distasteful and gratuitous. By far the biggest complaint about Kirkman\u2019s writing is the way he writes \u2013 or, rather, can\u2019t write \u2013 characters and it\u2019s becoming very clear now that he only really cares about developing one or two over the rest of the extended cast. The main character Rick isn\u2019t the greatest creation ever but he is developing and this volume shows how far he\u2019s gone from the character we met in volume one and the character he\u2019s become six volumes in. So while characters like Otis get killed off-panel and make a brief appearance as a corpse on the floor of a panel, Rick gets a splash page while he looks out moodily at a field. Another character dies along the way but, like Tyreese wisely says here, introductions only if you survive. I also really like how Michonne\u2019s character is slowly unravelling, especially after the trauma of Woodbury. She was already talking to herself when she first appeared but now the voices seem more insistent and desperate \u2013 when will she crack? What will happen when she does? I\u2019m interested to find out! Kirkman\u2019s also not good at conveying time. It doesn\u2019t seem that long since Lori revealed her pregnancy but in the space of 2-3 volumes she\u2019s gone from flat stomach to massive baby bump. If I had to guess I\u2019d say the series has taken in just a few weeks but by the looks of Lori\u2019s belly it looks more like 7-8 months! I assume the absence of marking time is to mirror the characters\u2019 perceptions onto the reader\u2019s \u2013 during the zombie apocalypse nobody\u2019s sure what day of the week it is, what month, etc. \u2013 but still, are we supposed to believe they\u2019ve been at the prison for months? They\u2019ve barely begun searching the place and only just started planting vegetables \u2013 either they\u2019re the laziest people ever or Lori\u2019s going through a super-fast pregnancy! Anyway, the series has come to life with this and the last volume, and I\u2019m really getting swept up in the story now. I\u2019m gonna guess the Governor\u2019s not dead \u2013 they left that detail open-ended \u2013 because he\u2019s too nasty a villain to do away with so quickly. I\u2019m also looking forward to the impending fight between the prison and Woodbury, probably in the next couple volumes - by which time Lori will probably have given birth and their kid\u2019ll be starting puberty!"}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/867629-justin", "userReview": "I\u2019m starting to realize that Walking Dead is one of those series that boasts a large number of fans that are oblivious to or are willing to look past its flaws. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a bad thing, but it is what it is. The universal acclaim that these books get seems to be at odds with some of the problems it has, especially by this point in the series. This volume, simply put, isn\u2019t put together very well, and isn\u2019t much fun to read. Spoilers ahead.The issues in this collection continue to chronicle the ordeals of Rick, Michonne, and Glenn at Woodbury, including their harrowing escape and return to the prison. The centerpiece of the volume is a long, graphic section of torture porn, as Michonne enacts her foreshadowed revenge on the Governor for raping and brutalizing her in the preceding days. They make it out of the city with the help of a few defectors, but find the prison overrun by zombies when they return. Fortunately, most of the people at the prison are safely holed up (waiting for Rick to get back before doing anything about it, I guess?), and they get their sanctuary secured and cleaned up again in short order. However, an incident with one of the Woodbury defectors stands as a stark reminder that they now have living, breathing potential enemies right on their doorstep.I read this volume faster than I usually do, but not because I was glued to the action. I was waiting for something profound or even interesting to happen, and it never really did. The extended torture vignette couldn\u2019t end fast enough; it added exactly nothing to the story, since it didn\u2019t seem to affect Michonne\u2019s character in any way other than Rick noticing the crazy mannerisms she\u2019s had since she was introduced. Also, I guess it\u2019s perfectly fine to illustrate rape and torture in graphic detail, rather than simply implying it like before, if the victim is a man who deserves it. It\u2019s a little weird to complain about violence in a zombie comic, I admit, but the whole thing seemed gratuitous. Anyway, we\u2019re introduced to a few new characters, and in the space of a few pages, one dies, one is immediately slotted into an archetypical role (the person with vague medical knowledge that must find the courage to become The Group's Doctor), and one is inexplicably revealed as a traitor and even more inexplicably murdered by Rick. Hmm.What story there was made very little sense, and really only served as connecting the plot point from the last volume (the existence of another, grittier group of survivors) with whatever the heroes are going to do next. It\u2019s not a bad collection, really, but I wouldn\u2019t really classify it as good, either. It doesn\u2019t really add anything, and could have done without a lot of the supporting details (like, for instance, the ridiculous gladiator fight scenario). The AMC series seems to be getting a lot of flack lately for aimless writing and confusing character decisions, but that\u2019s seems to be the hallmark of this volume.Honestly, I think I would have liked it better if I had read it as individual issues, with a cooldown period between each. There are a lot of powerful, visceral moments in the volume that leave a lasting impression if taken on their own, but they come off as weak and even silly when lumped together as a story arc. Now that we\u2019re past the long introduction of the Woodbury group, though, I\u2019m interested to see what happens next. In short, this isn\u2019t a terrible book, but it\u2019s easily the weakest of the series thus far."}, {"userName": "Gabby", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby", "userReview": "God damn, a lot of shit went down in this volume. A lot of graphic, gory shit. Rick is quickly losing his trust in humanity and I totally see why. I can feel Lori and Rick's relationship slowly getting worse and worse. I really loved most of this volume but there is one thing that kind of disappointed me and I can't really talk about that without giving spoilers. But damn, I am obsessed with these comics now. I'm hooked and I probably won't stop reading them until I'm caught up.SPOILERS BELOWSo... Martinez helped Rick and the group escape from Woodbury, but Michonne decided to stay back and get revenge on the Governor for all the shit he did to her (abuse, rape, etc.) and when she went back she fucking drilled his dick to the floor, drilled a hole in his shoulder, pried off all of his finger nails, chopped off his arm with her sword, stuck a spoon up his ass and then used the same spoon afterwards to spoon out his eye. I mean, god damn Michonne definitely got her revenge. I don't know if this means the Governor is dead? I was 100% sure he was but the characters act like maybe he might not be so I don't know.. But if he is dead, that was fast... He was only in one volume before he was killed? That's so disappointing because the Governor is one of my favorite villains and he hadn't even gone to the prison yet. Michonne probably just killed him. But, if he is dead, I like this death of the governor even better than the one in the show. I know obviously in the show they can't show graphic shit like that as they do in the comics, but wow. That was kind of epic and the Governor deserved it. Also, I loved seeing Rick realize that Martinez betrayed them and he went after him with the RV, he slammed into him with it and then he killed him with his bare hands. I think this is only the beginning of Rick losing his trust and losing his mind a little bit. Also, what is up with Michonne constantly talking to herself? It's so weird. Is she supposed to be insane? Or delusional? I don't know what's up with that. Also, when Glenn asked for Hershel's blessing to purpose to Maggie I was squealing! And then he actually proposed to her and it was so cute! I ship it so hard. Overall this was a really exciting volume and I can't wait to get to the next one!

Without giving too much away they make it back to their prison safehouse only to find things vastly different from how they left AND that one of them isn't who they made themselves out to be (cue creepy music).

Kirkman's introduction says it best: \"How many hours are in a day when you don't spend half of them watching television? When is the last time any of us REALLY worked to get something we wanted? How long has it been since any of us really NEEDED something that we wanted?The world we knew is gone.

And I am actually quite glad that I am, as this volume demonstrated that it is certainly possible for the story to get better and become interesting once again.In The Best Defense, Rick and some members of his gang found themselves in Woodbury, a walled off community under the rule of the sadistic Governor, and this volume basically picks up where that one left off as they attempt to escape. Although it was quite fun to read, having seen the Woodbury storyline in the TV series, some of the tension was took out of it, as I was relatively aware of what was going to occur.By far, the biggest problem I have with this series is that I just do not care about any of the characters and although this opinion has not completely changed, it is beginning to shift just a little. I still struggle to care for Rick, and if I am being honest, I do not think it is possible to like him at all. However, there was one particular moment where he had a tough decision to make that definitely questioned his morality, which I really like to see and I would love to see more of this in future volumes. Carl and Sophia's developing romance was slightly touched on in this volume and for me it is just not working. I personally think it would be better if they were just friends for now, especially as they are so young, and I would much prefer to see a proper friendship between them before anything else, as at the moment it just feels forced. My favourite character from the start was Glenn and although I would not say that he is still my favourite (as I do not think I have a favourite anymore), but I still quite like him. However, I still do not like Maggie. She tries to be sarcastic and witty, but it just comes off as spiteful and she did nothing but irritate me. Once again, Michonne talks to herself. However, now it just seems to be a way for her to explain what she is thinking, otherwise she is just emotionless as she does not speak her mind in casual conversation like every other character in this series, as they are unable to demonstrate their feelings in any other way apparently. The Governor was introduced in the previous volume, but he does appear to get sidelined in this volume, although I am sure he will be back.This Sorrowful Life does seem to be an improvement upon the past few volumes and it seems to be setting up for some very interesting events in future volumes. Although some part of me still feels as though this series has a great premise that is possibly being wasted, which is something I am desperately hoping they avoid.Rating - 3/5\u2605\u2605\u2605There is also a link to this review on my blog here!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca Schuster", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3444957-rebecca-schuster", "userReview": "My first three-star rating for a book of the Walking Dead series. ... It is not that it is a bad book. Not at all. It is really breath-takingly thrilling and again has some great cliffhangers even within the book.However, all in all this volume was far too \"Hostel\" for my taste (and I never watched the movie for a very good reason! The trailer was already hard enough to bear). Of course, the reader (the female one especially) is pleased to see that Michonne gets her revenge for the sufferings she had to endure.But then, did it have to be that graphic? I would have preferred to have her hint at the things she intended to do to the governor and then let the reader's imagination do the rest. There was no need for those pictures and the details of the guy's mutilation.Maybe, Kirkman wanted to stress that people turn out to be really evil when given the chance to do so without the risk of being punished - particularly in a tense situation, in which the use of extreme violence might function as means of catharsis. But then, he already did so by showing the governor's sick personality as well as - for example - Rick's gradual change from the \"good guy\" to the \"good guy who is able to do very bad things\"."}, {"userName": "Alondra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6130276-alondra", "userReview": "5 StarsSure, maybe it should be 4 or 4.5; but I don't think so.

We start to see their motivations with each scenario that plays out."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5369366-kim", "userReview": "The zombie apocalypse is freakin scary!

The previous two volumes lacked intensity and thrill for me, but this one gave me what I wanted! 4.25stars!SPOILERS BELOWThis volume was very enjoyable and satisfying. I think I will give it 4.25 stars (highest one yet)The best thing that occurred in the volume was Michonne's vengeance. That's what I was waiting for. Brutal, savage and very Michonne-like. I thought her characterization lacked and highly contrasted with her character in the TV show which I wasn't pleased with. Although she was portrayed as a mysterious, enigmatic individual in the first volumes she appeared in, she lacked those fearsome, independent and fierce elements which really made her stand out from all the other women (who are pretty passive e.g. Carol and Lori). From removing the governor's fingernails to cutting his hand off, to performing penectomy (cutting his dick off), inserting a spoon in the anus and taking his eye out with the same spoon, Michonne reveals her brutal and vengeful side. I mean don't fuck with her. (pun not intended). Seriously, the continuous rape justified her actions. Furthermore, the overall escape from Woodbury was very satisfying and promising. Rick and the others reunite with the gang and everyone is safe (apart from Otis who we don't care about anyway). I also enjoyed the scene where Rick hunts down Martinez and prevents him from revealing the prison location. Yes to murder (in these circumstances). Nice one Rick. Justified."}, {"userName": "Pedro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39139014-pedro", "userReview": "4.5/ 5Brutales las secuencias de Michonne torturando al Gobernador.
