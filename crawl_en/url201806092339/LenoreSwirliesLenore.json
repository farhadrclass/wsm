Volvemos a ver a Mr. Gosh y su eterno amor por Lenore. Y nuestra ni\u00f1a muerta sigue siendo igual de despistada y diab\u00f3lica como siempre.

We also see a different side to Ragamuffin and come across a Cupcake Castle after fighting a hoard of Nazi zombie soldiers sent to take Lenore back to Heck. The more I read of the collection the more I'm enjoying it and the more I love each of the characters and Roman's quirky sense of humour and somewhat unfortunate tales of his youth, in some case I feel his pain. This is a superb series that will have you going back again and again until you know every word and illustration by heart (although I bet even that won't stop you)."}, {"userName": "Karla Torres", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26654219-karla-torres", "userReview": "\u00c9ste fue sin duda mi favorito de los 4 tomos.

Tambi\u00e9n hay acercamientos con personajes conocidos, Mr. Gosh, golfillo( ragamuffin) y Mugre. Cap\u00edtulos m\u00e1s largos y mil veces m\u00e1s graciosos, nuevos personajes, situaciones m\u00e1s extra\u00f1as, ideas m\u00e1s sangrientas y macabras. Vagabundos de cabello, una invitaci\u00f3n a fiesta de cumplea\u00f1os, una batalla con demonios de la s\u00e9ptima capa del infierno. Un mont\u00f3n de l\u00edos.

I couldn't wait to get my hands on this deliciously undead collection of the weird. Despite there being a bit of a gap between books, it almost feels like Lenore never left us. I can only hope that Dirge is still doing this book on his deathbed, so Lenore can live as long as she can. This book is wild, weird, and laugh out loud (literally and not the dumb LOL internet speak that don't mean nothin') funny. I highly recommend you pick up this and return to Lenore's world of crazy."}, {"userName": "Nina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1870260-nina", "userReview": "I loved Lenore when I was a teenager. She was my first foray into comic books (along with JTHM and Squee). The early comics (and the content of the first two collections) were so dark and absurd, with occasional light relief. Reading this 15 years after that first revelatory purchase was disappointing. It felt like a fun comic full of goofy characters, with hardly any substance. Maybe I should just go and read my old copies."}, {"userName": "Arsnoctis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17121115-arsnoctis", "userReview": "Esiste un mio video su Youtube in cui parlo abbastanza liberamente di Roman Dirge e dei volumi dedicati a Lenore in particolare.
