However I was pleased to find myself right back in the lives of Scout and Atticus. I do agree that some of the storyline and thinking are controversial, but you have to consider the time period in which it was written. I found that I couldn't put it down just like Mockingbird. I like that Ms. Lee left some storylines hanging--real life is rarely tied up in a pretty bow."}, {"userName": "Lily", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44542614-lily", "userReview": "Reese Witherspoon did a wonderful job reading this audio version. Her easy-southern was not fake, and her Jean Louise is not irritatingly harsh. Peering out someone else's window to the world may come as a shock, especially when you always took for granted that you peered out the same window. It's nice to have a book published in our age that was written during a different era. We get accustomed to our pudding that we call PC; it's refreshing to be thrown some shaved ice to wake us up. I, a northern girl, get to see the changes to the south from a southern breed/northern living girl's eyes. It's emotion is raw enough to seem real, as was Mockingbird's. There are some things that don't ring true in Watchman, and so it's not quite the classic. Even though the emotion is real, it escalates too quickly in some parts. Real people do jump in deeply when arguing at times, but we expect more from fictional characters. Jean Louise rings true as a wonderful, believable character through most of the book, and then all of a sudden, she will have a scene that seems forced. I feel as if I missed something in those scenes. Just like Jean Louise, I expected Maycomb to be the same. In other words, I expected Watchman to be like Mockingbird. There was enough there to see that it was the same place, but so much was changed. I wanted Jem, Dill, Calpurnia to all be comfortably there, the same, unchanging. I expected Atticus to change, that is the one whisper that I did hear about before I read the book. His character was sound though; he was constant. Even his changes seemed true to human nature. And, yes, I couldn't help but see Gregory Peck as a 72 year old. One aside here, it bugged me that Jean Louise had no friends but those from her \"family\". She went to college, she lived in NY, but she had no friends? None?"}, {"userName": "Indy Fernandez", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8412566-indy-fernandez", "userReview": "I found it hard to like this book, at times I labored over the pages. What I fail to understand is if it was a draft which was rejected, why make the decision to publish it? I feel it came in riding on the coattails of To Kill a Mockingbird, with readers picking it up to read solely because of its author. I found it bland and it evoked no great emotion in me."}, {"userName": "Diana W", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25210769-diana-w", "userReview": "Too many rambling chapters!This book has both novels. I enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird despite the old fashioned lingo. I was seriously dissapointed in Go Set a Watchman. After coming across the many inconsistencies between the two books, I did some research. I discovered that Go Set a Watchman was her first book and inspired Mockingbird. Watchman was never meant to be published. After reading it I think it should have remained unpublished. It ruined Mockingbird for me. Such a rambling, boring book. I had to skip through some of the endless conversations with Uncle Jack and with Atticus. Mockingbird is a 4 star book, but Watchman is a 2 at best. I give the combination set 3 stars. If I had to do it all over again I wouldn't waste my time on Watchman."}, {"userName": "Dale", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11970890-dale", "userReview": "\"To Kill A Mockingbird\" The Social Justice Literary Classic that aired The South's Dirty Laundry with Grace and Eloquence only found in the South brought to life by the larger than life American Classic herself Sissy Spacek. Harper Lee, a \"Proper\" Southern Lady raised in Central Alabama with her best childhood friend Truman Capote penned this amazing piece of literature; \"To Kill A Mockingbird.\" The Audible version, read by the great Sissy Spacek, shouldn't be missed. Sissy's voice, diction, and fluency with southern accent and colloquialisms are the perfect match for Mockingbird's mastery of dialog writing. If you felt engrossed when reading the novel, the Spacek audible version pulls you into Macomb and you forget you are not right there with all the characters, she brings to life each resident of Macomb uniquely. If you close your eyes and take in the vibrant descriptions of Macomb you feel as if you are a silent observer to all that unfolds before Scout and Jim and not someone listening to an audio book. Sissy Spacek puts her heart and soul into this one lady dramatization of the Classic Novel.I decided to listen to the novel before I read the controversial new book published 55 years after Mockingbird. Harper is alive, but 89 a stroke victim, in a nursing home and has poor eyesight and hearing; many feel if she was more in control of her faculties the publishing of \"Go Set A Watchman\" a controversial manuscript would never have happened (because Harper and her sister Alice never approved its release). The \"new\" book is believed to be the first draft (rejected by her publisher) of the race relations novel she set out to publish in the late 50s after integration and as the civil rights movement was bringing to grow. The published novel hit the shelves ironically in 1960, one could argue that it was a catalyst to the decade that saw more social change than any before or since. To Kill A Mockingbird became a best selling highly acclaimed classic novel voted as one of the best pieces of American literature of the 20th Century ever published. It was and still is controversial because of the dialog that uses language acceptable in parlors and churches spoken by Gentlemen and Ladies alike in 1935 that is not acceptable under any circumstances after 1965. The language is so offensive to a contemporary ear a similar period piece could never be written in a similar manner. Sissy Spacek flows through the offense language, colloquials typical of illiterate people of the time in a comfortable manner that gives you the feeling of the language's acceptance. In the novel Ms. Lee invites you into the Southern Society of the 1930s the so vividly you feel like a resident of Macomb County, Alabama, and a best friend of Scout's and Jim's and has you witness the personal tragedy of Tom Robinson, the kind young Black man who was a victim of his color, prejudice, and bigotry because justice wasn't color blind then and still isn't today and Sissy Spacek makes you not a reader of history, but a witness to it all in a contemporary manner. Ms. Lee has an ability to describe the Rural South of the 30's, its Grace, Manners, and hateful bigotry; she doesn't hold back and peels back that grace and manners to reveal the ugly truths that literally took the lives of thousands senselessly and treated 100s of Thousands as less than human and systematically suppressed an entire race of people blocking access to basic literacy and education, to ensure each generation is no better than the previous. Sissy presents it so you taste it, smell it and witness it. \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" is the book that best describes and defines the meaning of White Privilege; which persists even today. It's always been around but her book ever so subtlety put it in written works and Sissy makes it real not to be ignored In my opinion the most important chapters are 17-25; the events and points made in these chapters I believe could not be ignored by American Society; it put in print the shameful crimes against humanity that occurs every day in pre-civil rights America and again Sissy Spacek makes you a part of it, you gain both sympathy, empathy, and guilt and makes you feel accountable. In Chapter 17 she introduces the world to the realities of a lynch mob and brings you to the edge of your seat as you anticipate the horrors to happen, but the mob is disbanded by the innocence of a eight year old girl. Then after the trial In Chapters 23 and 24 defines the bizarre social structuring that persists even today in many areas of the South, the pretentious righteous prejudice and bigotry that is still systemic today including suicide by law enforcement, racial profiling, and inequity in the justice system. She ends that segment by defining what \"White Trash\" and how the defendants of families of peerage, the actual salve owning land baron families, the 1%ers of their time had evolved into the \"progressive\" movement in the South and were the ones that spearheaded, supported, and promoted integration, civil rights, and advocated and championed equality. What better group to do so than the educated families that experienced great loss of wealth and land to only retain their refineries and education."}, {"userName": "Robin Norcross", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57189959-robin-norcross", "userReview": "WonderfulI wanted to revisit mockingbird when it wasn't required reading, and watchman was a great add on.

To Kill A Mockingbird was written from the point of view of a very young child. Scout has grown into a woman and she resides in New York City, so she has become wiser and more astute as she had to be in order to function as a young woman alone in the big city. When she returns to Macomb County, she views the reality of life in the deep south from a different perspective. Atticus hasn't changed, but Jean Louise has, and she begins to see things with new eyes that reveal the stark reality of that life. It is a time when America is taking a good long look at itself and its bigotry and bone deep prejudice. I found this book to be quite powerful in a much different way from what I expected. Don't fear this book.

I liked it a lot but wasn't overly impressed. I was expecting something much more eye opening and thought provoking. That being said, I would have enjoyed reading Mockingbird in high school much more than others, such as A Streetcar Named Desire.Since this was my first reading of Mockingbird, I also read Watchman for the first time. I couldn't finish it. I can count on one hand the times I have not been able to finish a book. Unfortunately, this was one of those times. I was all around bored and kept losing interest. Way too many extra stories that were not vital to the storyline.As I read these two books as s collection, I will average my two ratings together. Three stars for Mockingbird and one for Watchman.

Go Set a Watchman? Well, it was interesting, and I enjoyed it up to a point, but it is NOT To Kill a Mockingbird. I also think that all the controversy surrounding this book is correct. Harper Lee never intended this book to be published. It was the book which led to her book, \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" but it is not the same caliber. If her sister and protector had not died first, this book would never have been published, as Harper Lee's next lawyer would not have \"discovered\" the book and had it published. It says a good deal about the successor as lawyer to Harper Lee, and none of it is favorable."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33759220-catherine", "userReview": "I really enjoyed re reading To Kill a Mockingbird as an adult. I enjoyed it much more than the first time around. Especially the antics of the children trying to arouse Mr. Radley from his house. Go Set a Watchman was enjoyable as well however there were some clear continuity issues with her first book. This is understandable due to the manuscript like nature of the text. I really enjoyed the small peaks into the life of Scout and Jem that we did not get to see in her first book. Like the period story and the dance story etc. I was disappointed in the easy exclusion of Jem from the story with out much sentiment or reasoning. It was an enjoyable read over all."}, {"userName": "wendy richmond", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37911877-wendy-richmond", "userReview": "Exceptional finish to my favorite charactersThis was one I was afraid to read, being that \"To Kill A Mocking Bird\" was the one singular book that turned me into a avid book reader over 35 years ago.
