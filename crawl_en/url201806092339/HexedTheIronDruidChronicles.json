But I don't think so anymore and the issue is ruining my enjoyment of an otherwise good series.You see, this series is terribly sexist - yet it's all so subversive that it was hard to pin at first.There are many, many female characters. Normally, I'd consider this a good thing. However we can effectively separate them into categories.Harmless, likable and a sex objectHarmless, laughably evil and a sex objectDangerous, unstable and a sex objectFor example, Atticus' initiate is harmless and likable. She is probably the only woman who fits into this category. She's also probably the closest thing Hearne has written to a positive female character.The many, many evil witches in this novel fit into the second category. Atticus is sure to take special note of their appearance. I say laughably evil because whilst they have power - it's nothing compared to Atticus' and Hearne goes to great lengths to make them objects of derision in our eyes. They will always try petty, pathetic things that make you happy that Atticus lays the smack-down on them. They are arrogant and tragically doomed to fail like Team Rocket from Pokemon. For every evil male character there are at least eight bad female characters. There is only one Harmless and laughably evil male character. There are many, many of these female characters and they all play second fiddle to the main bad character - a man. They are Hearne's version of the nameless goons in Bond movies. They are the faceless Red shirts from Star Trek.Then there's the Dangerous, unstable and a sex object category and possibly the most offensive. These are women that Atticus is supposed to take seriously because they are all powerful in their own right - many are supposed to be more powerful.Yet even goddesses are throwing themselves at Atticus to be in his bed. All of them are seriously unstable, highly emotive and completely subject to their own pettiness. Atticus spends most of this novel indulging them like you would play to a crazy person to keep them happy. I guess it's hard to blame Hearne too much. Men and the medical profession have been painting women as hysterical, unreasonable creatures for most of history. It's nothing new but it's terribly disappointing. The ruler of the Tuatha De shows up and plays the damsel in distress to Atticus. She does the whole, \"Help me, Obi Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope!\" Routine in the first book. Seriously? SERIOUSLY!? She is the fucking RULER of an ancient people. SHE IS A GODDESS! It's just all so... unempowering.Still, I thought I was being sensitive after reading the first novel. In the second, Atticus strips Brighid down, humiliates her and lectures her in very reasonable tones while she froths at the mouth and acts the part of two-bit villain. Now I'm just insulted. An immortal goddess, so proficient at politics, bargaining and magic is so pathetic that she would act as she did and be caught as she was? Oh, of course. She's a woman and this all makes sense if your unconscious bias is to believe that women - even immortal ones - and creatures completely enslaved to whatever petty emotion is running through their fragile bodies.Atticus' sexual assault, the use of sex as a weapon and many, many other small instances in this book only cemented my opinion that Hearne does not have a high respect for women - or he simply knows so little of them. There are much fewer male characters in this book - yet every single one with the exception of Percy, is a powerful, reasonable, intelligent, logical character. When comparing their uses and functions in these books, it becomes clear that men, as characters, as significantly more likable, powerful and reasonable than women.It's a really sad thing to behold for a series that is otherwise fun and interesting."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "So far I have only read 2 of these books but they crack me up \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nDemons smell like @ss--nasty @ss that slithers down your throat, finds your gag reflex, and sits on it with authority.\nI love that Atticus is a hot Druid that gets help by the Earth.

It was Mr. Semerdjian. \"Yes, sir, how may I help you?\" Everything was back to normal--that is, vines looked great and so did my mesquite tree. The saguaro cactus using its many arms to mold stone as if it were clay and making loud bugcrunching noises was admittedly worth comment. My neighbor raised a skating index finger to point at the saguaro. \"That moving cactus . . . and the big bug. . . and you, you spooky bastard. What are you?\" I stuffed my hands in my pockets and grinned winningly at him. \"Why, I am the Antichrist, of course.\"Mr. Semerdjian responded by fainting, which seriously surprised me. I'd expected a vulgar expression of disbelief, like a middle finger or a clenching of the crotch, because the man had seen a giant demon and casually offered to blow it up like a tough guy.\nAtticus' lawyer wants him to kill Thor and is mad at him because he doesn't want to. I love Thor! Anyway, Atticus has two lawyers, one a vampire and one a werewolf. So some evil witches are trying to take over the town so Atticus has to get help from some other supernatural beings to help get them out. There are other things going on as always seems to be the case in these books.

I mean, name one romance novel with a sexy druid as the leading man. ....See? I'm not saying it's impossible, but if you managed to do it, you probably had to think about it for a minute. Oh, and I'm also not saying Hexed is a romance novel! It's not. I just meant that once a magical person/place/thing hits romance novel status you're pretty much sick of the sight of them. As in, remember when vampires were scary motherfuckers and not sexy motherfuckers? Yeah, those of us from the Jurassic era look back fondly on those days...On a happier note: Hexed has a druid! And all the fun gods that come with him...Yes, there are werewolves, fae, witches, and even a vampire in this book, but to counteract the been there, done that feeling of those characters you've also got a handful of less used magical people/creatures. Including, but not limited to, the Atticus' adorable sidekick, Oberon.I mean, who wouldn't want a talking Wolfhound to be your BFF?Ok, truth time. There's something lacking in these books that I can't quite put my finger on yet. It isn't as though I don't enjoy the action, the plot, or the characters...I do! But at the same time, I'm not in a great hurry to pick up the next book in the series again. And whatever the reason is, it must be why I forgot/abandoned these books to start with. Still, it's hard to find a really good urban fantasy series that doesn't regurgitate the same old crap characters, so I'm determined to give this the Iron Druid a fair shot at winning my heart this time around.Original review: 2012Hexed picks up where Hounded left off. Atticus is dealing with the fallout from killing his old enemy, and the power vacuum that his death caused. A lot of the gods want him dead, or on their side...whichever is easier.And of course, everyone wants him to kill Thor next.This is a pretty fun action/adventure series, and so far I'm really enjoying it. Recommended for fans of series like The Dresden Files."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "When Tempe's witch population booms, Atticus O'Sullivan is forced to make peace with the members of the former coven and join forces with them to drive the newcomers out of town. But what other deals will he have to make to see his task through to the end?Hexed is the second volume in the Iron Druid Chronicles and nearly as good as the first. Witches following Bacchus roll into town from Vegas and start shaking things up. Throw in Coyote, Atticus' new apprentice, and some mop from the previous book and Hexed is pretty hard to put down. Once again, Atticus gets bits burned and lopped off, but manages to survive. He also manages to set up the next book.The magic system in the Iron Druid Chronicles works better for me as a reader than that of the Dresden Files. That might be that Atticus doesn't explain the same things in every book, though. His modern slang continues to get on my nerves, however. I understand that he needs to fit in but his personality doesn't really fit my concept of a 2000 year old being either. He seems more like a typical 30 year old and doesn't display much more wisdom than that. I did appreciate the depth of his pop culture references, although he could stray further from the Butcher repertoire.Curmudgeonations aside, I still had quite a bit of fun reading this. The widow McDonaugh and Oberon continue to be my favorites among the supporting cast. The witches were further developed and I expect they'll continue being a prominent part of the series. The Morrigan and Brighid seem to have a power struggle brewing. Hexed shows that Hearne's pulling Atticus from the Harry Dresden mold but the imprints are still pretty clear.

I stopped around chapter 13 or so.Positives: The narration is decent. I liked the inclusion of Coyote. I think he is a great character. I enjoy his presence in other books by other authors, this one was not an exception. Atticus and Oberon are mildly entertaining. The scene where Oberon talks to Atticus about life and death and Atticus tells the readers that he has been artificially prolonging Oberon\u2019s life was very moving. This was the best scene in the two books I read in this series. Ultimately, this series is just not for me. I love urban fantasy and fantasy books. I enjoy male authored and male point of view books, but for me this book missed the mark. I am clearly in the minority. Okay, on to the rest of my review: I thought this book suffered from the same issues I had with book #1: no emotional connection with Atticus, low cost to using his magic, everything comes easy for him. here is my review for #1. I am not going to go into a lot of detail about this book, but here are some scenes that irritated me:The scene in the beginning where his assistant answers the door scantily clad is just beyond silly. First, no woman who was not purposely trying to entice would answer the door dressed like that. Let me make it clear -- I have no problems with purposely trying to entice, titillating scenes or scantily clad women. It was the delivery of this scene I thought was off. Once Atticus is conversing with her, his apprentice is apparantly clueless as to the affect of her near nakedness and continues to wonder out loud why Atticus is uncomfortable and looking up in the air? Umm, any woman knows immediately when a man is reacting to her appearance in such an obvious way! Sorry Kevin Hearne, women don\u2019t answer the door dressed like that generally and usually don\u2019t go to bed wearing such an outfit unless there is a specific man present they want to please. I hope this doesn\u2019t disappoint you too much. I know the general style of humor he was attempting here -- oblivious sexy woman doesn't understand her effect on man, walks around in sexy nighties just waiting to answer the door for men who ring it. I just thought it was not very believable. And because of that I couldn't enjoy it.Atticus verbally attacks a teacher who calls out and wonders what is going on, no animosity in her voice \u2013 he is fighting a demon near the school. Atticus then proceeds -- out of nowhere and completely disconnected with the scene \u2013 to attack the teacher for not teaching the children English well enough. So here we have someone he apparently does not know, we have had no information or discussion of poorly prepared students in the subject of English presented in this book thus far. Then Atticus says to himself, \u201cI need to shut up and stop taking my frustrations out on this poor frumpy lady who probably never gets laid.\u201d Huh? Just random attacking of teachers based on assumptions, criticizing their appearance and then making assumptions that they don\u2019t have sex because her appearance is not pleasing to him? I really don\u2019t have a problem with \u201cfrumpy\u201d as a description, but when it is contrasted with how he describes almost every other woman in the story and we don\u2019t get to know anything else about her appearance (mousy limp hair maybe? Don\u2019t know, not in the description. Slack ill fitting clothes? Don\u2019t know, not in the description. All he says is \u201cfrumpy\u201d which I guess means he doesn\u2019t want to have sex with her and thus he assumes she is not getting laid very often, because you know if Atticus doesn\u2019t want her she isn\u2019t getting any. What if she has a husband or wife somewhere she has spent her life with? I know I am getting deep here and humor was intended. I just don\u2019t think it is funny to make jokes about innocent bystander's appearance. It really rubs me the wrong way.) I know the humor he was going for, but it just came off the wrong way. I think that if he also described men as frumpy or had provided more of a decription of this woman beyond \"frumpy\" and had not equated her being frumpy with not having sex, I likely would not have had an issue. For me it was the delivery e.g. -- I find her unattractive, I will dismiss her completely and assume that no other man wants her. I honestly don't think this is the way most men think.I won\u2019t be reading or listening to Hammered, #3 in this series."}, {"userName": "Celeste", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste", "userReview": "Full review now posted!I've got to give Hearne one thing; the man is funny.Hexed is the followup novel to Hounded, the first book in the Iron Druid Chronicles. I find that with many longer series, the second book tends to be a good deal weaker than the first. A large part of this is due to a successful first novel being optioned into a series, and the author having to find a way to stretch their idea into multiple books, generally far more than a trilogy in the urban fantasy genre. Often, by the third of fourth book the author has found their stride with the series, but this frequently results in a second book that is weak and forgettable.That might have been the case with this book if not for one thing: the humor. I wasn\u2019t nearly as interested in the lore for the Polish and German witches who featured so prominently in this book as I was in all of the Celtic lore presented in Hounded, but the amount of humor seeded throughout the book kept me reading anyway. There were so many hilarious, nearly slapstick situations packed into the narrative that I could actually overlook my relative disinterest in the main plot line. Also, our main character\u2019s canine friend, Oberon, is even more entertaining than he was in the first book. The dialogues between him and Atticus, and between Atticus and various other side characters, were often so funny that I honestly laughed out loud as I read.Something I love about these books so far, and the reason I\u2019m looking forward to reading more of the series, is the mix of lore from around the world. Books that serve as a mythological melting pot, such as Neil Gaiman\u2019s American Gods, just make me really happy, and this series shows that promise. While I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the Eastern European witchcraft lore around which most of the plot was based, I loved the additions of the Native American god Coyote, the Virgin Mary, and various Celtic goddesses who were present in the first book. I also love how much everyone, no matter what pantheon they come from, hates Thor. As the next book is entitled Hammered, I have a sneaking suspicion that this hatred will be addressed soon.I didn\u2019t enjoy this book quite as much as the first, but I did really appreciate the humor.

How do you live up to the expectations generated by a good first book? Despite the fact that I have given book two the same rating as book one, there were a few disappointments in the second installment.First, there is not nearly enough of Oberon, the wolfhound. His character made the first book for me and although he features prominently in book two, his page time had been cut down. I miss all his dopey doggy comments. And this despite the fact that I am not a dog person.Second, Atticus now has an apprentice, Granuaile, who really doesn\u2019t get to do an awful lot in this book. Perhaps she will get her spot in the sun in upcoming volumes, but it was a shame that she had to spend what little time she got concocting alibis for Atticus and pretending to be his girlfriend (and, unbeknownst to her, distracting him with her feminine attributes\u2014I mean really, this guy is supposed to be 1000 years old and he is still that easily distracted by a pretty woman?)Third, there are lots of women in this book. Lots. And it still fails the Bechdel test miserably. The women don\u2019t talk to each other in any meaningful way\u2014they are all focused on Atticus. They are all merely plot devices to make him look powerful or solve a problem for him. However, I am willing to continue for at least another book before I decide to abandon this series. I like the Celtic mythological aspects. I like the druid angle. I love Oberon. I see potential in Granuaile. Summer is winding down, and as it does, I will have less time for this urban fantasy fiesta that I have happily indulged in.

After Atticus finally defeats his long time nemesis Aenghus Og, he thought he get a nice break, of course that\u2019s so not the case for our last druid! Not only does he almost get killed by a long distance magic attack by a new coven of witches, but he has to deal with some crazy Bacchus and to top it off a fallen angel and the everyday troubles-like the cops! The story just zooms by with Atticus trying to keep the peace on his home turf, and getting pulled into things that we wish he could avoid, but with humor and some heavy back-up Atticus goes in there fighting. For someone really old, Hearne does a great job of slowly revealing Atticus\u2019s past and more is relieved about him in Hexed. as he helped families in WWII (a fun moment when Hal - werewolf lawyer and the good witch coven gather around with popcorn to hear his war stories) Atticus is also shown not to be no where near perfect, with his prejudice against all witches, he\u2019s seen to have more trust on the coven he makes a treaty with, and his view of black and white/ good and evil is put into shades of grey as he fights along side the coven.  He\u2019s such a guy that he can\u2019t help but being a normal guy which makes him all that much more loveable to me from drooling over the sexy woman going by, which is very cute. One part had me cringing and laughing with some beat down sex Atticus goes through, but Hearne once again keeps to the story and doesn\u2019t use the sex has a filler but more of a passing joke. There\u2019s also a very serious side when he comes face to face with one of his own goddess, and keeps his head and uses his brain very well, something he\u2019s great at when having to deal with non-magic uses on Kabbalistic priests from a group Hammers of God or the cops! Atticus is not all humor and laughs and butt-kicking, there are moments of deep emotion that tears at your heart and gives you a deeper look into the loneliness, he\u2019s faced through the many many years. One was his talk of after-life and death with Oberon his hound, whom has come to mean much to the reader as he has to Atticus.  Oberon of course, is a big part of the Iron Druid series, and going through his 60's phase as Peace Dwag with a tie-died scarf and \u201csticking it to the man!\u201d and with some one liners and conversation that will have you rolling on the floor with laughter! \n Oberon asked hopefully  \"Yeah, but not the kind your thinking about unfortunately\" I said aloud  Characters that only get mentioned in Hounded get more time in Hexed, like the trickster Coyote, and Atticus nighttime laywer Leif, whom stole the show when he showed up with his ever proper English and trying to be FUCKIN\u2019 A cool told in a flat tone and which ends up falling flat in humorous way. Leif has a bone to pick with Thor (whom everyone seems to love to hate) and leaves a opening to the next book Hammered. Granuaile, Attiucs\u2019s new apprentice, starts showing her smarts and her backbone, standing up to Attiucs when she feels he\u2019s in the wrong. Looking forward from more of her and the steady growth of her character.  Hexed had more action that kept your page flipping, with Atticus thinking on his feet and glimpses of more of his powers as he fights the evil German witches called the Daughters of the Third House and other enemies. The action was at perfect pitch that don\u2019t go overboard comic-book style or magical lighting or flash, but quick take-downs to getting the job done as quickly as possible. The book went quickly by with a nice wind-down at the end leaving you happy with the ending and wanting more!  The series has made such a fangirl out of me, that\u2019s fine by me.

This one really falls somewhere between 3 and 4 stars for me but I have decided to go ahead and round up. I was really excited to get back to the series after enjoying the first book in the series. This is definitely a series that needs to be read in order since this book picks up shortly after the events of the previous installment. This ended up being another enjoyable listen.One of the things that I loved the most about the first book was the characters. I was really happy to see all of the key players back for this installment in the series. There were a few new characters that were rather impressive as well. I really like Atticus. He is incredibly patient and able to determine the best course of action in most situations. I love that he has adapted to the present time better than most of the other that have lived a very long time. Oberon is such a wonderful character and anytime he was a part of a scene I usually had a big grin on my face.This book has all of the excitement that I had hoped to see. Atticus has to team with the local witch coven when bad things start happening. Atticus has several problems that he is juggling during the story and somehow he makes it all seem easy. This book balanced the action very nicely against some of the lighter moments in the book.Luke Daniels continues to do a fantastic job with the narration of this series. He does such a great job with all of the character voices and adds a lot of emotion to story. His portrayal of Oberon is simply outstanding. I couldn't imagine an intelligent Wolfhound sounding any other way. I had not problem listening to this one for hours at a time.I would recommend this series to others. It is a very unique series that contains the perfect combination of humor, action, and thought provoking mystery. I can't wait to read more of this wonderful series.Initial ThoughtsMaybe 3.5 stars? I liked this one but not as much as the previous book in the series. Oberon is still my favorite character and I do wish he had been in the book just a bit more. This was highly entertaining with appearances from most of the characters that played a part in the first book. Luke Daniels continues to do a fantastic job with the narration of this series.Book source: eStories purchase"}, {"userName": "Mr. Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15984059-mr-matt", "userReview": "Atticus and Oberon are back! This book picks up immediately after the first volume, Hounded. Atticus, his dog, and his new apprentice are trying to resume their peaceful, quiet life when, out of the blue, he is attacked by a coven of diabolical German witches. To make matters worse a group of Bacchants are descending on the town from Las Vegas. It turns out that killing all those witches at the end of the last book created a bit of a power vacuum. Atticus must either get out of town or fill the void himself. Now that he is no longer hiding from an angry deity, he decides to throw down.Parts of this book tickled me to no end. And those parts start with Oberon. He is exactly what I expect my dogs would be like if they could talk. Sweet, good natured, ready to pitch in to help, not quite understanding of human behavior, and, in general, big, goofy fur-balls. For example, when Leif, the vampire, describes how bad Atticus' neighbor smells (\"Like a chili dog with mustard and cheap light beer. His blood courses with grease and alcohol\"), the dog's reaction is priceless: \"Wow. I didn't think he would smell that good.\" That's exactly how a dog would react. His obsession with treats was also funny. Oberon enlightens the whole story. Without him I am fairly certain these books would struggle to really find themselves.A couple of things kind of bothered me about the book. As a father or two totally awesome daughters, I couldn't help but think that this book would fail the Bechdel test - in a very big way. Women are portrayed in only one of two ways: sexpots or villains. There are the somewhat friendly coven of local witches that have enchanted hair and lips that always seem to reduce Atticus to a quivering mass despite his protective magic-cancelling amulet. There is the Goddess Morrigan who jumps Atticus' bones to work some (I kid you not) 'sex' magic (and to pre-empt the Goddess Brighid, who also wanted to jump his bones)! And then there are the Bacchants - female followers of Bacchus. These ladies slap their staves down and create an instant insane party where everyone's inhibitions evaporate and they descend into an uncontrollable orgy. Of course, the Bacchants are also evil. As are the German witches (who happen to look like porn stars). The few women that are neither one nor the other are generally minor characters - the widow, his apprentice. (And even his apprentice gets into the act by play acting she's in a relationship to cover Atticus with the police.) Finally, reading the books, I just get a sense that this is Harry Dresden in Arizona. Fun and enjoyable, but still Dresden and Mouse.

Atticus' Gary-Stuness, his talent of getting away from danger every single time, the fact that an omg scarily powerful!!!! fallen angel was no match for him (and oh hey, it pierced his side to the point where he felt the claws \"scrape by his ribs\" - and after the battle was finished, all he had was a \"flesh wound\"). The veiled sexism (covered very well in this review, which gave me a Bad Feeling before starting this): every woman is introduced by how attractive she is. The completely out of place snark on public schools. The Morrigan healing his ear with magical healing sex. Brighid coming by immediately after that, burning his kitchen, and then sitting through a three- or four-page scene wherein he subdued her, lectured her on why that was wrong, and made her apologize.

I find them both to be fast, engaging reads, with a host of interesting characters, from the main ones to the minors. Hexed has a load of action, perhaps too much, but it's largely appropriate, as a couple conflicts are fall-out from Hounded, and the new one involves an invading witch group. I enjoy the complexity of Atticus, from his seemingly extreme distrust of witches, to his committed friendship with his wolfhound, to new details we learn about him during WWII. Oberon, his hound, continues with his clever remarks and provides quite a few laughs.I really enjoy the earth magic Atticus uses and feel its a different angle on the road to power and magic systems. I find it interesting that he seems to feel restoring life to the forest destroyed in Hounded is so important, but unfortunate that he gets minimal time to do so in Hexed. I look forward to learning why he hasn't recreated a druidic grove and what the implications will be.I know some feel like he is too powerful, but ultimately, he is supposed to have two millennia to refine and gather his power--that's a whole lot of time. I also believe Hearne is using the terms \"gods\" much like the Greeks and Norse did--immortal members of a pantheon of deities, but certainly not all-powerful or all-knowing. Understanding that helps make it clear how Atticus can beat a \"god.\" I also feel his tips to the goddesses about amulet making help give the impression of how time-consuming some of that learning can be. As a matter of fact, that leads me to one of my only quibbles with the series, in that Atticus \"feels\" and acts so young--a little too contemporary. Reactions to attractive young mortal women seem to encourage the sense of youngness, in that he is very embarrassed by his reaction to his apprentice. There is a section in Hexed that deliberately deals with language \"updating,\" and Atticus giving hints to another long-lived entity. But he generally seems and acts like a contemporary, spending very little time meditating/ experimenting/ practicing, and mostly maintaining his business, socializing with the neighbor and going for runs with Oberon. In short, he feels and acts like a young modern soul.Nonetheless, his story is engaging and the cast of side characters are fascinating. I plan to continue the series and will undoubtedly put it on auto-buy."}, {"userName": "\u2615 Kimberly ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082615-kimberly", "userReview": "Atticus O\u2019Sullivan, the last of the Druids resides in Arizona with his wolfhound\u00a0Oberon.

I can honestly call myself a new fan of this author. I am already aching to sink my teeth into the third. What I am most pleased about is the well rounded line-up of gods and baddies to do battle with, not that these books are entirely a type of beat-em up fiction. He does a great job with that, but more important is the much better character development. I was already planning ahead for it in the first novel, expecting some great stuff later, and of course it's always a pleasure to be satisfied. It is a shame that the novels aren't bundled together, but that can also be expected for later. It's pretty obvious the third is very closely tied to the first two. I'm reminded of Butcher's Dresden, that is also clumped together naturally.I'm really enjoying this guilty pleasure series. :)"}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "If you had lived over 2000 years what would you do for fun when you got together with another long lived such as yourself?

When he isn\u2019t running his book/tea shop he seems to be a pawn for the gods. Yes god(s) there are many of them, from all cultures and it seems that Atticus has the attention of far too many after killing a minor god in the last book. There is also the matter of some remaining Demons still bound to kill him before they are free of their bounds. Atticus seems to be finding trouble everywhere lately.I still like this book but I didn\u2019t love it. It was missing something that I really enjoyed in the first book and at the moment I can\u2019t put my finger on it. I\u2019ll blame it all on the witches. I didn\u2019t connect with that part of the story as much and so the coven of bad witches wasn\u2019t as enjoyable to me.I still liked a lot of things though. All the pop culture references, the time spent talking with Oberon (I totally love that dog his thoughts are hilarious), and even the representation of Coyote a Native American spirit and trickster. \n\u201cYou know how people are always threatenin' to shove this or that up someone's ass, but they never really do it?

I\u2019d like it if there was one, besides a slight flirtation with his apprentice Granuaile in which he thinks about baseball to control his attraction (do guys really do that?) there isn\u2019t much of anything on the romance horizon. There are also a few goddesses trying to bed Atticus but that is more for political maneuverings and for the most part didn\u2019t seem very enjoyable.Still I really like the lore in the book and how the magic of the druids works. A few new very interesting factions have been added in the mix and Atticus has promised some favors to a few players so the next boo might be more interesting.

If like me you were kind of so-so on the first one, you may feel the same way here as well.Audio book: Mr. Daniels once again does a decent job. I think I've gotten used to his normal reading voice such that it didn't bother me in this book. He again does a few accents and voices, including his excellent take on Oberon.\nFull Review\nI wasn't really planning on jumping further into this series after being mostly underwhelmed by Hounded. However Audible, the length of the book and my reading schedule all colluded to get me to do this one.I found it about on par with the first. It's possible I liked it a little less. It's hard to say for sure. I think your opinion on the first book will largely determine your opinion of this one.It started too slow again for such a short book and had a lot of seemingly random elements introduced that eventually all tied together.Oberon who found as the highlight of book 1 was already starting to annoy me by this book. His constant obsessions and stupid jokes felt repetitive. Maybe I'm simply spoiled by the excellent humor of the Dresden Files, but I just didn't really find his role of comic relief very good.It's possible that this series isn't for me. They aren't bad books, but they aren't great and there is plenty of other stuff to read.These books do have a light quick nature to them that can make for a quick time filler or diversion for heavier/darker reading, but I'll likely be taking a break unless Audible has another sale, or I decide to see if I can borrow the next audio book from my library sometime."}, {"userName": "Flannery", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/652877-flannery", "userReview": "This series is a fast and easy listen.

This has made him more visible in the supernatural world, and now he\u2019s got a whole new crop of problems. German witches have moved to the area and are attacking him and the Polish witches. Bacchants have arrived, too, and are spreading chaos in Scottsdale. The Morrigan and Brighid are having a power struggle, with Atticus caught in the middle.

Looks like the biggest one is coming due in the next book, Hammered\u2026As for \u201cfunny,\u201d if anything, Hexed is even funnier than Hounded. Some scenes and quips had me howling with laughter. Wait till you see how Atticus explains a singed kitchen cabinet to the police, or what Oberon becomes obsessed with now that he\u2019s over his Genghis Khan kick, or what happens when an a stuffy vampire tries to learn modern slang.In addition to the humor, there are some touching moments. As the owner of an aging dog, I sniffled a bit when Atticus talked about the usual lifespan of an Irish wolfhound and the measures he has taken to keep his best buddy Oberon by his side.Hexed has something of an episodic feel. There are several different plots here, and their structure is more sequential than interwoven. There are links between Atticus\u2019 adventures, but for the most part, he deals with one threat, and then either that leads to a new problem or else the new problem arises while he\u2019s trying to relax after dispatching the previous one. The overall effect is that of reading several shorter Atticus stories.I had the opportunity to devour Hexed in both print form and via Brilliance Audio\u2019s production. Luke Daniels\u2019 narration continues to be excellent. He captures Atticus\u2019 snarkiness and his assumed \u201cDude\u201d persona perfectly, and does well with the accents and the foreign names.

Oddly enough, instead of lining up to kill him, the old Gods want to enlist his help to dispatch some of their own foes. Hexed is another action-packed installment in Hearne's The Iron Druid Chronicles; full of demon hunting, manipulative Celtic goddesses and witchy magic. You can't go wrong with this series on audio; both the writing and the narration are phenomenal. A definite must!I love how versatile Luke Daniels' narration is; he's a pro at transitioning from one character to the next and does a great job of giving each of them a distinct voice with the help of accents, pitch and tone. I especially enjoyed his Coyote persona because he absolutely nailed the Southern twang and slower paced dialogue. His interpretation of Oberon never fails to bring a smile to my face and I think Daniels' has Atticus' POV down to a tee. I was relieved to hear him pronounce \"Roosevelt\" correctly this time around but he did botch \"nocked\" (as in an arrow) a few times which was a mild irritant.The mythology, multiple plot threads and scheming characters help ensure that this book is never dull. There's even a bit of sex in this installment, just probably not the fun kind you're thinking of! Needless to say, the Celtic Chooser of the Slain and the Goddess of War's tastes are anything but vanilla. However, she's not the only Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann who's vying for Atticus' attention; Brighid, the Goddess of poetry, fire, and the forge also wants a piece of the druid pie. Oberon still continues to be the star of this series; from his bath time adventures to his doggy humor, I just can't get enough of his POV. As a dog owner I've often wondered what goes on inside their heads and these books do a great job of playing off of that. Atticus comes in second on my list of favourite Iron Druid Chronicles characters; I love how he can talk circles around practically anyone and, can often times diffuse a volatile situation with logic and reason. However, when all else fails there's always Fragarach or in this case... RPGs! Hexed combines intense action with quick-witted humour to create an entertaining experience that's truly unique.
