We are introduced to Charmian who, as with Gull in Black Ships, will take us through the world Jo imagined. And through Charmian, we will meet Cleopatra, Gaius Julius Caesar, Marcus Antonius, and a host of other characters, some of which seem comfortingly familiar\u2026 The tale that unfolds will echo in the hearts of everyone who reads the book because we\u2019ve all been in the same situations the characters are placed in, and you will sink away into the story\u2026It\u2019s easy, from the get-go, to see how comfortable Jo is in her writing, now; not that she wasn\u2019t comfortable in Black Ships - her debut possessed a raw and fetching beauty, as Cleopatra was in her younger years, but Hand of Isis possesses the stately, knowledgeable and serenely confident beauty of Cleopatra after Gaius Julius Caesar. Jo knows now what she is capable of, having tested the waters, and I\u2019m certain that we will be in awe of Stealing Fire, her next book, when it hits the shelves.Everything that we came to admire about Jo\u2019s writing has become orders of magnitude better - her characters are beautifully realized, so much so that you\u2019ll find yourself wanting to actually meet them, observe them, talk with them. Having watched the HBO series Rome, read Asterix and Cleopatra and also read Conn Iggulden\u2019s Emperor: The Gods of War, I\u2019ve come to know many different incarnations of Cleopatra, Caesar, Mark Antony, as have many of you, I\u2019m sure; the versions that live in Hand of Isis seem somehow more personal, as if we\u2019ve been given an intimate glimpse of the real people behind the historical figures. Some, like Mark Antony (Marcus Antonius) surprised me, others gained greater stature (Gaius Julius Caesar), and others I fell in love with (Charmian and Cleopatra herself). One of the marks of storytelling that will be long-remembered is the ability to create characters that live in your imagination, and consequently, your heart, and Jo\u2019s has such a talent at this that if it could be solidified and prepared, a pyramid could be constructed! :-)The worldbuilding in Hand of Isis, too, is far beyond what Jo achieved with Black Ships; the Alexandria of Charmian and Cleopatra is vibrant, beautiful, and immense, a character in itself with its own rhythms and moods. Even Rome is amazing! But the worldbuilding never drowns out the progress of the tale or the characters, either; it immerses you in the scents, sounds, sights and flavors of that time so that every page springs up like a 3-D landscape that you yourself travel through.This is a tale to savour, to sink into, and to remember and fall in love with. Expect to be surprised by the strength and Jo\u2019s vision, expect to book tickets with a time-travel agency to spend a few weeks in Cleopatra\u2019s Egypt (and if you know of such an agency, let me know!), expect to feel all the emotions the characters feel, expect to feel and odd disappointment at the end of the book because you didn\u2019t want it to end, and expect the shedding of tears\u2026I highly, highly recommend Hand of Isis to anyone, everyone, who loves good storytelling, wonderful characters, history-buffs (even though I\u2019m not one and cannot speak to the historical accuracy of the novel), hopeless romantics\u2026 You will all love this book! :-)C\u2019mon, Jo! Stealing Fire! I need it! :-)9/10"}, {"userName": "Hannah PS", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5874949-hannah-ps", "userReview": "Hand of Isis tells the story of Charmian, a privileged woman growing up in Ancient Egypt while experiencing visions of Isis. It uses the framing device of Charmian posthumously telling her story to the gods of judgement -- in a non-intrusive, non-self-referential fashion.With her sister Iras, Charmian is sister and handmaiden to Queen Cleopatra. She has romantic adventures, friendships, worries, and enacts political machinations. Although well-known historical figures are integral to the plot, the novel is very much Charmian's story. I enjoyed her as a narrator a great deal: she has a very solid personality and there are humorous touches that deflate a sense of overwhelming doom.The language suits me just right: it evokes atmosphere while feeling effortless. Graham also has a deft touch when creating the sense of historical drama without using too much inaccessible language. There are anachronisms here and there -- mostly medical -- but they did not throw me out of the narrative. And though the time period is not one I'm very familiar with, I had no trouble gathering what was going on.On the worldbuilding side, Alexandria and the combining of Egyptian, Greek and Roman cultures feel richly detailed; discussions of art, theatre and religion between people from different cultures felt realistic rather than an exercise in info-dumping. Depictions of sexuality up and down the Kinsey scale are frank and sensual. And the fantastical touches such as Charmian's visions and her talking to the gods feel comfortable and concrete: Charmian takes her visions in her stride and does with them what she wants.I particularly enjoyed the focus on women in Hand of Isis. Charmian has male romantic interests and male friends, but her focus is always on her relationship with her sisters and with Isis. The sisterly relationships is humorous, strong and, at times, very moving. It's unusual to see a fantasy novel -- and a historical fantasy novel at that -- showing such close ties between female characters, and I found the whole thing delightful and moving."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118558-sarah", "userReview": "If I hadn't read Black Ships before this one, I might have given Hand of Isis three stars, but coming after Jo Graham's powerful first novel, this one was a disappointment.I think part of the problem lies in the fact that Cleopatra's story has been told and retold so many times by so many people, it is hard to find an original voice. While Black Ships was revolutionary, Hand of Isis is nothing new.Black Ships was written with a powerful, wistful poignancy; a story about those who have lost everything trying to find a new home. In comparison, Hand of Isis felt vaguely trashy and soap opera-ish. I was also disturbed by the graphic non-consensual and borderline consensual sex in the book, as it was uncomfortable and unpleasant to read.The fact that most of the characters were supposed to be reincarnated from the characters in Black Ships was also forced, ridiculous, and unnecessary. It was distracting, and added nothing to the story.Hand of Isis demonstrated meticulous research, and had its points of interest, but it was sadly lacking in comparison to the author's first book."}, {"userName": "FicusFan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1104480-ficusfan", "userReview": "I got this book through the Librarything Early Review program. I already had the first book  Black Ships  but have not read it yet. It is a choice for a RL book group of mine for May.Luckily the books stand alone in the sense that the stories are different. I think some of the previous characters come back via reincarnation, but as different people in this book. I was in no way lost in this book or the overall story arc by not reading book 1 (yet).At the start I found the writing to be OK, but rather pedestrian. It wasn't choppy, but it didn't flow. It just seemed to lie there on the page. It was easy to put the book down. Reading the story in small chunks just didn't make it compelling or make the story come off the page and live.I was also daunted by the size of the book. Its hard to enjoy a huge tome if you think it might not be worth your time. The print is rather large so it really isn't as much as it seems. Once I was able to invest some uninterrupted hours, it became very worthwhile.The story is set in ancient Egypt. though it is Egypt in the age of Hellenism. The story starts during the end of the reign of Ptolemy Auletes the father of Cleopatra, who was the last Egyptian Pharaoh. The narrator is Charmian who is a slave/handmaiden of Cleopatra and also her half sister. She and another half sister, Iras, also a slave/handmaiden are with Cleo from the age of 6 until the end. The story covers Cleo's early years and her interaction with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony, and the end in Alexandria.Of course we all know the story and how it ends. In fact at times I felt I was reading scenes from the movie Cleopatra. Perhaps the author could have been more inventive, but she chose to follow the traditional story line. She filled in the details of what happened off stage so that we got a glimpse of their lives outside the spotlight.The details of the setting and life at the time in Alexandria are well done, as are the characters. The narrative and description felt relaxed, and didn't seem like it was trying too hard to be 'old' and it wasn't jarringly modern. There are small trips into the real land of Egypt, but mostly it focuses on Greek Alexandria. The pacing is a bit uneven. The time with Caesar is given more depth, while the time with Antony is mostly summarized.There are wonderful characters: Charmian, Iras, Cleopatra, Dion, Emrys, and the children who pop in and out of the story. It took me a while to get into the story, (250+ pages), but when I did it was riveting. It may be that the long build up to engagement was laying the ground work so I ended up really caring about the characters. Or it might have been that the story blossomed when I was able to read in large chunks. I feared for them, and was crushed by their losses, and happy for their peace and joy. Tissues are needed once the book moves to the end.There are a few sex scenes and Graham has a wonderful menage-a-trois, where 3 of the characters find happiness together. I really like it when ancient people are not portrayed as modern Americans who are really republican protestants under the skin (ala the horrible movie Troy - at least Alexander took risks and tried to be real).There are small sections when the narrator, who is dead when the story starts, is telling her life to the gods Isis and Serapis/Osiris. She must have her heart judged against the feather of Maat to see if she belongs in the land of the dead, or if she will be judged evil and devoured and destroyed. The gods are real and there is a bit of magic in that Isis appears or guides Charmian in life. Charmian is also is a seer who has prophetic dreams. The fantasy bit was well done and worked into the story. It takes the beliefs of the time and makes them real, much as moderns believe in their own religion and do not consider it unreal.I also thought it was interesting to work in the idea that the battle was between East: Alexandria and the heirs of Alexander, and West: self-made Romans. That the best of the East: spirituality, learning, tolerance, and personal freedom could have pointed the way for the development of the rest of the world. Instead it was the best of the West: organization, rules/laws, uniformity, restless aggression that won out. We live with the consequences to this day. Some are very good, but others are not, and the rest of the world shares them with the West.I really came to enjoy this book and can't wait for the next one."}, {"userName": "Juushika", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/616321-juushika", "userReview": "Charmian is Cleopatra's half-sister; together, she and her sisters pledge to serve the goddess Isis and to make Cleopatra the queen and savior of bankrupted Egypt. Unfortunately, Hand of Isis has a slow start and some heavy-handed religious aspects, so it's not as successful as Graham's first novel, Black Ships. Still, it's a success: a balance of private story and public history, all of it touched by religion and magic, Hand of Isis is a brave historical fantasy retelling which often achieves its lofty goals. It's not my favorite of Graham's novels, but I throughly enjoyed and recommend it.I found Hand of Isis a somewhat slower start than Black Ships\u0097perhaps because I am less familiar with its history, perhaps because the story takes some time to come into itself. Cleopatra is such a famous and controversial figure that the reader waits on tenderhooks to see how Graham will portray her, and it's a long wait. The story begins in childhood and Cleopatra is not the protagonist, and so it takes almost 100 pages to figure out where Graham plans to take her story. The turning point is the girls's pledge to Isis, which becomes the heart and soul of the book\u0097but is too easily achieved. Isis's in-the-flesh appearance is too simple and sudden; it feels unbelievable, and so weakens the connection between the characters and the gods. This connection is further muddled by past life recollections which, though they're often subtle and effective, sometimes feel tacked on (especially since they connect Hand of Isis to Black Ships, yet never appear in the latter). Over the rest of the book, however, these religious aspects are built the hard way, slowly but believably and to much greater effect.500 pages isn't too much longer than the average novel, but Hand of Isis feels long\u0097but once it gets going, that's a good thing. Graham builds her story around both day-to-day activity and grand historical events, a balance which makes her story personal yet purposeful. In the vein of Black Ships or Bradley's The Mists of Avalon, Cleopatra's story is retold as a true story touched by magic: the historical figures are real people and historical events are well researched, and all of it is touched by religious events which give the story delightful magic and great importance. The book has a slow start, the level of detail sometimes slows the pacing, and the religious apsects can be heavy-handed, and so Hand of Isis is not a sweeping success (as Black Ships was)\u0097it begs a little more editing and polishing. Nonetheless, it's brilliant. From private romance to public politicking, from realistic individuals to handmaidens to the gods, Hand of Isis spans history and religion but never loses sight of the characters that drive it. That's a lot to juggle in one book, but Graham knows what she's doing and does it well. I prefer Black Ships, but those looking for more from Graham will do well to seek out Hand of Isis. It's a similar style in a whole new setting, and lives up to its predecessor. I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/933512-susan", "userReview": "Jo Graham's Hand of Isis is a story of ancient Egypt as seen through the eyes of Charmain, a young handmaiden and half-sister to Cleopatra. Exiled into the Black Lands as girls, Charmain, Cleopatra, and a third sister named Iras, devote themselves to the goddess Isis, vowing to be her hands and avatars on earth, and to love and protect the people of Egypt. Isis rewards the girls for their devotion by setting into motion the events leading to Cleopatra becoming Queen, while Iras and Charmain remain Cleopatra's most trusted handmaidens and mistresses of her home. Hand of Isis chronicles the lives of the three sisters while as stewards of the land of Egypt and her people, they interact with various other key figures of ancient history such as Julius Caesar and Marcus Antonius.Hand of Isis was not a \"can't-put-it-down\" read for me in the beginning, but once I gave it a little time, I quickly fell in love with it. The story is told as Charmain recounts her past deeds to Isis and Osiris in the Halls of Amenti. Charmain has come to Amenti to have her heart weighed against the feather of Ma'at to see if she may enter the afterlife, or if she will be judged as evil and her heart devoured by the demon Ammut. As she tells her story, the reader is devastated by Charmain's losses and cheered by her devotion to her sisters and Isis. It is impossible not to be emotionally connected to the characters in this enjoyable novel.Hand of Isis is a highly-readable account that offers a fresh perspective to the history and legend of Cleopatra. The mystery of ancient Egypt comes to vivid life through Jo Graham's imagination. The details of the ancient world are dazzling and fantastic, making for a compelling and entertaining story. Hand of Isis is an inspired mixture of intrigue, mystery, and romance, liable to delight most fans of historical fiction.Just one further note:When I picked up Hand of Isis, I did not realize that Jo Graham had previously written another novel of the ancient world, Black Ships. While Hand of Isis is not really a sequel, it does contain characters which are the reincarnated souls of characters from Black Ships. I don't think I lost anything in not reading them in the order they were published, but you may want to pick up Black Ships first - I would have if I had known, but I fully intend to rectify this situation just as soon as some other excellent patron of the Fort Bend County Library System returns the only copy."}, {"userName": "Catherine Oughtibridge", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6390337-catherine-oughtibridge", "userReview": "The Hand of Isis is the story of Cleopatra told through the eyes of her loving sister Charmian. It spans Cleopatra\u2019s life from her birth and childhood to her death.Some people won\u2019t like the sex scenes and the candid way sex was part of the story. However, I found it refreshing. Additionally, including homosexual and bisexual characters made it feel representative of people generally. I loved Charmian\u2019s candid approach towards sex.A significant part of the story involves the Egyptian gods and Jo Grahams slightly odd way of dealing with faith and dead. This will alienate some readers, however I found it an interesting angle to take and felt it added something to the story. It raises some questions about the role of religion in understanding and dealing with death, and asks questions about our abilities to accept people with different beliefs to our own.My complaints about the book are mostly a feeling that the pacing was inconsistent, meaning my attention was lost at times. Normally this type of book compels me to complete reading it quickly; however, I put it down for days at a time and eventually finished it in little over a month. It seemed to jump focus. Towards the middle, I felt told about Cleopatra\u2019s activities and character, and not shown them. The relationship between the sisters was weaker in the second half, which was unfortunate as this was a major strength of the book in the first half.This was a book I didn\u2019t quite know what to think about. My opinion of it changed so much depending on my mood. Sometimes I genuinely didn\u2019t think it was very good. Yet somehow, I couldn\u2019t forget about it. It was almost as if it was haunting me, making me read until the very end. I didn\u2019t want to read the end. I\u2019m not too clued up about the history of Cleopatra. I\u2019ve never watched a film about her and this is the first book about her I\u2019ve read. I did however know she would die. I didn\u2019t want her to die. Maybe it was the conflicting emotions that made me dislike the book at times. Sometimes I loved it. I could relate to the characters which seeing as they lived over 2000 years ago and had a very different standing in life, not to mention living in a different continent and society, seems like an achievement. The vivid descriptions made me want to know more about Alexandrian society and the scientific and engineering inventions mentioned.I look forward to reading more of Jo Graham\u2019s work, but I\u2019m going to wait a while until I do."}, {"userName": "Leeanna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2877693-leeanna", "userReview": "Hand of Isis, by Jo GrahamI wasn't sure if Graham could top her first novel, \"Black Ships,\" which I enjoyed very much. But \"Hand of Isis\" was even better, and I liked it five times more, if that's possible. Chairmian is handmaiden and half-sister to Cleopatra, the last great pharaoh of Egypt. While a slave, Chairmian has a remarkable amount of freedom and education, which are testaments to the Egyptian culture of the time. Given as a child to Cleopatra, Chairmian and Iras (also a half-sister to Chairmian and Cleopatra) accompany her through the journey of life, from educational awakening to the throne of Egypt, and beyond. I didn't realize it for quite a while, but Chairmian is actually Gull reincarnated, the main character of Graham's first novel, \"Black Ships.\" At first I thought, oh no not another oracle, but Chairmian is very different from Gull, and she never fully acts on her ability and instead has small glimpses and a few visions of future and past events. Neas from \"Black Ships\" is also reincarnated in \"Hand of Isis.\"Chairmian and Iras, along with Cleopatra, make a plea to Isis to put Cleopatra on the throne, promising that she will be the best pharaoh and do all she can for the people of Egypt. Chairmian provides an insider's glimpse to Cleopatra's actions in seducing Julius Caesar and Marcus Antonius, in attempting to restore Egypt to itself and not as a puppet of Rome. While Cleopatra is interesting, and lushly described, Chairmian herself is just as intriguing. She is unique in Egypt, with her curvy blonde features. She also has a unique relationship, one that I won't spoil. As one of Cleopatra's handmaidens, Chairmian is responsible for organizing her household; the descriptions of events are simply amazing. Additionally, Graham has a background in politics, and you can see that when she describes the political tangle of the ancient world. I was captivated by \"Hand of Isis\" from start to finish, and couldn't even look at anything else while I was reading it. While the size may be imposing to some, don't let that stop you from reading a wonderfully enthralling story. Graham describes life in ancient Egypt and Rome realistically, and Alexandria might as well be another main character for the attention she lavishes on it. I really want to read more about the time period now, and to me, that's the mark of an excellent historical fiction novel. I could have read another 600 pages of Graham's historical recounting. 5/5."}, {"userName": "Kelly Houser", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1388304-kelly-houser", "userReview": "Synopsis: Set in the desert plains of Egypt, Charmian, the half-sister of the infamous Queen Cleopatra, recounts her life's tale in this epic historical fantasy by Jo Graham. Charmian tells of a sparse childhood being raise by just her mother, who was a servant to the pharaoh. Not knowing that her father was the pharaoh, Charmian is startled when she learns that the Princess Cleopatra is her half-sister. She's even more stunned to learn that she has another half-sister, Iras, and that Iras and Charmian are to be live-in playmates to the Princess.As the three girls grow up, they become closer than playmates. The grow into the sisters they actually are. While Charmian recounts a seemingly normal childhood for the girls, she details Cleopatra's tumultuous and dangerous rise to the thrown and her struggle to keep it. She lends her voice to the details of Cleopatra's romances, first with Julius Caesar and then with Mark Antony. But Charmian has her own tale to tell and she tells of her own passions, of becoming a mother, and of being in the most impossible of love relationships.When the end finally comes for the great Cleopatra and her sisters, it is Charmian who carries the reader into the afterlife and on the next part of her journey.Review: I have read nothing else by Jo Graham, but after reading The Hand of Isis, I most definitely will. Graham is an extraordinary writer and the author's talent lies within the details of the novel. Almost everyone is familiar with the story of Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, and Mark Antony. Told from Charmian's point of view and with the most dazzling attention to detail, Graham breathes new life into this familiar tale. Graham takes such care with descriptions and details in this novel, that the reader cannot help but feel the sands of the desert blow across them, or to hear the lapping of the Nile river.Charmian as the narrator pulls you in with her strength and honesty. Her voice is genuine and tangible. The reader feels as if Charmian is sitting with them, telling them her story personally. She adds a dimension to this novel that no other character could, and while Cleopatra is very obviously the focus of the novel, the reader wants to hear and experience Charmian's life, just as much as they do the Queen's.I highly, highly recommend this novel."}, {"userName": "Ali Cross", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1989930-ali-cross", "userReview": "At first when I started reading Hand of Isis I was thrilled that it read so much like Jo Graham's first book Black of Ships, which I loved. However, soon the similarity in voice began to distract me.Who's head was I in? Sybil's from Black Ships? Or Charmian's from Hand of Isis? There was very little, outside of lifestyle and circumstance, to distinguish between these two characters. I'm at a loss for what to say exactly about the voice because I love it, but I thought Charmian should stand out more from Sybil and be more herself. That being said, I love Graham's voice and am feeling conflicted, lol.Hand of Isis tells the story of Charmian, handmaiden and half-sister to the great Cleopatra. Cleopatra has forever been an icon of the past and I found the subject matter and the crystalline way Graham wrote about her to be fascinating.Graham wrote Hand of Isis in that beautiful lyrical way that won my heart in Black Ships and told about a time long past as though she really had been there.Next to the voice of the main character, the only other thing that disturbed me about this book were the rather graphic sex scenes. There were only a couple throughout the entire book, but they were powerful enough to leave me feeling disappointed that I had read them. I hadn't expected them and kept thinking that they would soon be over or that something important would come of it. In the end, I just wish I'd turned the page. I think what was most troubling about the sex scenes was the nature of them--they were not romance in the traditional sense, but dealt with the abuse of power and the alternate lifestyle choices that were the norm in early Greece, Rome and Egypt. Homosexuality and Bisexuality were acceptable practices at that time and so they were a part of Charmian's life. I just wish I hadn't read about them. I wish there had been a warning sign \"avert your eyes!\" before I came to those parts. I think the story would have been just fine without them--less is more, I think in this case.So, overall, I'd say I'm a wee bit disappointed with this, Jo Graham's second book. While it was rich in beauty and imagination, it lacked in originality from her first book and in decorum."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4193046-amanda", "userReview": "Hand of Isis is the second book in Jo Graham's fascinating series about the ancient world titled Numinous World. I have to admit a mistake here -I actually read book three, Stealing Fire, before Hand of Isis, so I was a little out-of-order when I started this book. Thankfully, the plot lines of each novel are unique enough that it doesn't make a big difference. But I will point out that I think Hand of Isis is the best of the Numinous World books. Seriously -if you think this type of stuff isn't for you, try out Hand of Isis. It's worth it.Hand of Isis follows the fascinating life of Cleopatra through the eyes of her handmaid, Charmian, her illegitimate half-sister. From a young age, Charmian and Cleopatra have an unmistakable bond, and the two become confidants. Charmain isn't just any other handmaiden though, she is also a seer of Isis who has visions from the goddess. Charmain's story unfolds in Graham's well-constructed, almost lyrical prose, which is filled with plenty of history and lush description, but filled in with just enough fantasy and fiction to keep things from being too predictable. The story is actually framed as a series of flashbacks told by Charmain to the gods Isis and Horus after she dies, about her life and, of course, about Cleopatra. While Charmain is as interesting characters with plenty of struggles of her own, mostly in the romance department, the real draw is Cleopatra. The Egyptian queen is portrayed from her younger years up to her dramatic death, and, unlike is some other interpretations, she's given a very human face that's sympathetic and real. More interestingly enough, Graham injects a heavy dose of Egyptian mysticism and religion into Hand of Isis, which I found fascinating. By far the best book in Graham's Numinous World series, I'd honestly vote to just skip the other books (or perhaps even bot bother with them) and just go for Hand of Isis."}, {"userName": "Carol March", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18785377-carol-march", "userReview": "Another intriguing tale by Jo Graham, this one about the life of Cleopatra, is told by her half-sister and handmaiden, Charmian. We follow Charmian, Cleopatra, and third half-sister Inas through their childhood to maturity, through historical and personal upheaval. As children, the three girls agree to be the \"hands of Isis\" if Cleopatra is put on the throne, which at the time seems unlikely. Their goal is to preserve the vision of their illustrious ancestors, the Ptolemy's, and to improve the life of the Egyptian people. Yes, we know the story, but Graham puts an entirely different spin on it. She weaves history, myth, and religion, again, into a tale told by Charmian to Isis after her own death during the famous \"weighing of the heart\" ceremony in Egyptian religion. The re-incarnational aspects of these two books (and also Stealing Fire, set in the aftermath of the death of Alexander the Great) delighted me, as I write such things myself, and Graham handles it beautifully. Gull from Black Ships is reincarnated as Lydias, one of Alexander's Companions, who orchestrates the theft of Alexander's coffin under the direction of Alexander's general who became the first Ptolemy to rule Egypt. Three hundred years later, Lydias is re-incarnated as Charmian, and at one point in the story, visits the graves of her own children. All three characters are \"god-touched,\" able to see the future, and they all possess a strong sense of moral integrity. The point of view characters speak in the first person, and although very different, and living in very different times, their voices resonate with each other through dreams, visions, and memory. I highly recommend Hand of Isis to anyone who enjoys historical fantasy with speculative elements."}, {"userName": "Carrie Slager", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8854256-carrie-slager", "userReview": "Cleopatra is one of the most written about figures in history and I\u2019ve rarely seen a new take on her story. Yet Jo Graham has managed to do this in Hand of Isis by telling the story from the perspective of her half-sister handmaiden, Charmian. As you can probably guess from the blurb, Charmian has special powers that help her half-sister rule Egypt in a time when only men were rulers and this book is a cross between fantasy and historical fiction. Yet this mixture of fantasy and history works well because Jo Graham has obviously done her research on the historical events.The plot is not exactly fast, but it certainly is interesting. You will learn more about Cleopatra reading this novel than you will from any history textbook out there, I guarantee that. Jo Graham has paid incredible attention to historical details, so much that I would say not even Pauline Gedge has managed this level of attention to detail. And that\u2019s really saying something. Filled with romantic subplots and magic, Hand of Isis will also keep you reading into the early morning hours, even though you probably can guess how the story ends.Charmian is a very realistic protagonist because like real people, she is full of contradictions. She is sort of carefree when it comes to love, but at the same time she is responsible because she takes control of some of the governmental functions so Cleopatra is not as overwhelmed. Cleopatra herself is definitely not the cold-blooded seductress that the Romans and most of history painted her as, but a capable leader who would do anything for her country. What she, Charmian and Iras sacrifice for Egypt truly is amazing.I give this book 4.5/5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars for Goodreads rating purposes."}, {"userName": "Kathryn Scannell", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4926853-kathryn-scannell", "userReview": "This is the first book I've read by Jo Graham, but it won't be the last. I've got the other two books in this series on my wish list now. Writing a well known story is always tricky, because you can't just rely on the reader's desire to find out what happens to carry them through to the end. In this case, pretty nearly everyone knows the story of Anthony and Cleopatra. It ends badly. Nearly everyone involved dies. Getting the reader to want to stay through to what they already know won't be a happy ending is even tougher, but she pulls it off with style. One of the things I really liked about this is the way she handles the magic. This is a fantasy. There are gods who interact, at least occasionally, with their worshipers. But they're not in your face, providing easy solutions. They rely on their followers to get things done, with a little guidance and the occasional warning. This feels very much grounded in reality. The magical events in the book are very much in tune with what's known of magic and religion as practiced in that time and place, which is rare and refreshing to find. With Charmian she paints a vivid picture of what it's like to be a servant of a higher power, and the sacrifices involved. It's not about power, it's about service and commitment. Charmian is a wonderful character, who will stay with me for a long time."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1521601-carmen", "userReview": "This book was another recommendation by my good friend, Tuningmyviola, and I just love her because she recommended and lent this book to me. It\u2019s a book about Cleopatra VII Philopator, the last Pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty. The wars that had to be fought to keep her as ruler of Egypt is mentioned, through letters to Charmian, Cleopatra\u2019s sister and also the teller of this story, but never explained in detail which can I believe can bore even great minds! The reason I enjoyed this book, as I also enjoyed Helen of Troy by Margaret George, is the certainly illustration of the strength of the women in these books, be it through the character of a mother, a ruler or even a lover, the determination and dignity is always there. These women were inspiration to their countries as they stood by each other, Iras, Cleopatra and Charmian and they are still inspiration today. These three women kept a country adrift in times of war and men\u2019s hatred. Yes, it cannot be denied that they fell for these men\u2019s love, as the men also fell before Isis, but they were still characters with much dignity and honor, just as much as the strongest warrior.

The story was told from the point of view of Cleopatra's handmaiden, Charmain, of the childhood and reign of Queen Cleopatra.Constantly, Charmain is challenged in deciding between the fate she promised for herself as a young girl, pledging herself to be a hand of goddess Isis and Cleopatra's protector, and being a lover to a man. Her sacrifices are touching and moving throughout the story peppered with detail about an Egypt we all still crave to know more about. Cleopatra is a vision of beauty and her love affairs are as scandalous as the real life love affair of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Charmain also has some interesting romantic affairs until she finds the most beautiful love triangle ever invented in literature. The detail of Egypt is rich and unforgettable.

The one that recounts the life of Charmian, daughter of a slave and a Pharoah, as she tries to help her half-sister Cleopatra save Alexandria.It's a familiar story, and it's kind of sad to fall in love with multicultural, free, technologically advanced Alexandria knowing it's going to be swallowed up by Rome. I enjoyed Charmian's great freedom, her unconventional relationship, and her devotion to Egypt and Isis. I didn't find her break with Agrippa very convincing, though. It was like an invasion from a romance novel: I never got a single letter from him! Sure, letters have to travel hundreds of miles over land and sea through war-torn territory, but the only thing this can mean is that he doesn't love me!The reincarnation story that underlies both of these books assures us that the Companions will rise again, but of course no one has ever succeeded in establishing the perfect city on earth, so presumably they're still trying.

From the narrator Charmain, orphan of a pleasure slave and Ptolemy Auletes, Pharoah of Eygpt, we learn how to freely give oneself to all that we love and to open ourselves to love in all its forms. From Iras, we discover that the search for knowledge and the value of freedom can be enough to fulfill us. From Cleopatra, we learn what it must take to rule an empire as a woman.This wonderful account of the days of Cleopatra will keep the reader riveted to the page, providing a new side to the famous story. The story was seamless and the characters well developed. Charmain is a loving and exquisite narrator, bringing faith, honesty, and a deep well of love to a story of politics, deception, and war.

Throughout the book the author touches on past life experiences, Celtic, Roman and Egyptian culture, and a smattering of religion. This is her second book, and I am *eagerly* anticipating her third.

So we follow Cleopatra's story through the eyes and ears of her handmaiden. Charmian felt different than Gull and Lydias. She was a girl who enjoyed the company of men, who liked pretty things, who was very proud of serving Cleopatra. Again she found someone who she could follow to the end of the world (first Neas, then Hephaistion/Ptolemy, and now Cleopatra-who is Ptolemy) - but this time she is no common slave, she belongs to one of the greatest kingdoms and is important to Cleopatra.This time, the book had more women - three sisters were the focus of the story. Of course, the wind through the world - Caesar - appears and also our other friends, Xandros and Neas - who are now Emrys and Agrippa.As always, I was excited for Gull and Neas to find their way to each other and be happy ever after. It was sad that didn't really happen...I felt bad for Agrippa when Charmian refused him. Obviously he was stupid of asking her to give everything up, but he was a young boy and he didn't mean to offend her, I guess he didn't really think it through. Charmian was a bit too radical I think...especially because she had been thinking of becoming his hetaira and then all of a sudden exploded on him. And then when he became her enemy (actually Marcus Antonius enemy who by association became Cleopatra's enemy but ok) I understand that she was mad because of the kids, but again, he tried to do what he could and she was really mean. I felt like this was to be some kind of karma that she would carry to her next life lolEmry and her was nice and all and the open relationship or three-people-marriage they had with Dion was nice and all, but I am more of the undying kind of love person :) this thing of being in love with several people at the same time is not something that I could work out and Xandros/Emrys always seems to love Gull along with being in love with other people. Feels like Gull is never his number one, it's like they're best friends who really love and respect each other. And it's really nice but I also would like a romance that was complete and focused only on Gull. Why hasn't that happened yet...people always loved someone else too, or more than her (Xandros loved Neas, Hephaistion and Bagoas loved Alexander, Sati didn't really appear much, Emrys loved Dion). I hope she'll have her one true love story soon."}, {"userName": "Hannah Kim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60247873-hannah-kim", "userReview": "***Let me just say that 3* for me is a very respectable score, just falling short of \"outstanding\" (4*) or \"I'm so obsessed I've read it till I can quote it backwards\" (5*)***With Hand of Isis I admit I went about this the wrong way in reading it before Black Ships(which I've not actually read), so for me the references to the previous lives the main character Charmion merely served to convolute the story a bit. (My fault for not researching the book and its prequels, oops.)Not to say that I didn't find the concept of reincarnation fascinating, but there were some parts where it just seemed it was added in clumsily and didn't necessarily give anything to the storyline at hand. If I were to read the other two books I'm sure I would find it interesting to go ahead and reread it with greater understanding, though, and there were some great moments such as when Charmion visits the grave of her previous life family, which certainly piqued my interest.The characters were interesting, well nuanced and I liked the fact that each of the three sisters represented a trait of the goddess Isis, complimenting each other while not sugar coating the friction such differences caused occasionally. I thought Jo Graham portrayed the bond of sisters extremely well.Charmion herself was willful, sensual and smart, an active player in her own life and a refreshing voice in that she was extremely well fleshed out, strong and relatable. Cleopatra, too, was handled with skill, bringing the complex historical character to life through the eyes of her sister. Iras, I felt, was a decent character but served in only a secondary capacity to her two other sisters, although she was given a few moments of development too.Dion was a likable character and the love triangle of Charmion, Dion and Emrys was certainly like no love triangle I've read before. I laughed aloud at the timetable they presented to that poor soldier and felt that Jo Graham handled the clashing cultural norms regarding sexuality, the openness of Alexandria vs the disdain of Rome for homosexual practise, very well.I have to say, it was so refreshing to read from the point of view of such a sexually aware and adventurous character. Her openness in this way and many others made her a truly brilliant character, a pleasure to read.All good so far. Yet as someone who has read a number of various historical fiction pieces centered around ancient Egypt (covering perspectives from Hatshepsut, Nefertari, Tiye and Mutbenret) I found this portrayal of the country's last dynasty a little lackluster. It wasn't that I was squeamish about the sex - casual, barely consensual sex was part and parcel of the time period in question so the brief description of the rape of the serving girl and how it was a small event in one page of the story, or Cleopatra's own political agenda in losing her virginity seemed authentic to me. I know some people have found that distasteful but that's not my issue at all. The reason I have given a three star review, not a four or five was just that there lacked a certain oomph in it for me. It was great, fantastic in some places, but that elusive quality that takes a book from an enjoyable but forgettable three star, although it may have all the right ingredients, to an unforgettable story which stays with you long after you read the last page, were absent.It's been a year or so since I read it so I can't pinpoint exactly why this was, but I know I found Emrys more than a little dull. He was good, dutiful, sometimes affectionate but he had no spark for me when compared to the more amusing and fleshed out Dion.I know, complaining about the love interest is a little cliche, especially when I liked the fact his character was an addition to the story, not the driving force behind Charmion's whole life. Yay for a female driven plot focused on the sisters' relationships rather than the men!That being said (and I can't tell you how much I enjoyed that message of the story) having the MC's love interest hold all the interest of a shriveled kumquat among a bowl of ripe, juicy mangoes for me (personally) was a bit of a disappointment. But you may like kumquats. I just found him blah. Sure, he was from the oh-so-exotic Europe with his strange name and soldier-ly good looks, but he was entirely unforgettable among the cast of strong characters with complex motivations. The romance seemed too...again just blah, aside from the threesome in which Emrys seemed to take a backseat to the more vivacious Charmion and Dion. Moving on from the yawn-worthy romance though, there was a lot of political intrigue for this book to cover, between the crumbling of the last Ptolemies as they wrangled at each others' throats, Egypt's relationship with Rome, the Roman domestic politics and the perception of the general Egyptian population towards the influence of Rome, and this meant that Jo Graham had an almost impossible job of giving all these angles their due attention in order to world build. A daunting task, no doubt.I usually love me some good political intrigue, juicy and full of intrigue, yet I remember feeling turned off when this book headed in those directions, I never felt I knew all that much about the other Ptolemies to care about their bickering. Berenice, Tryphaena, neither one given more than a passing glance. With regards to the Egyptian political intrigue information seemed to be just dumped at certain points, dealt with and the plot moved on without showing more to it. Maybe my issue was that the story was more focused on Rome than Egypt, which honestly makes sense considering the part Caesar and Marc Anthony play, yet I was looking for a heavily Egyptian novel when I opened it. Again, my fault for not researching before reading.Such minor quibbles aside, it was a very well sculpted novel and I enjoyed the many layers to it, the characters and the incredible scope. It covered a complex period of history and did so with superb realism, spots of humour and intricate detail. While I may have done some things differently, the choices Jo Graham made with story direction and characters were well thought out and she did justice to such an incredible story of history while adding something unique to the Cleopatra narrative, something impressive since it has been rehashed endlessly."}, {"userName": "VP Grey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22115374-vp-grey", "userReview": "I loved this book. I loved the story, the writing, and the characters. The concept is brilliant, and it has inspired me to learn how much of the story is true, more about Cleopatra and Egypt at the time of the Roman Empire. The story centres of a subtle magic of gods and goddesses. It is as much historical fiction as fantasy, and that really works well. The characters feel real, and the world solidly built. It spans quite a few years, and the passage of time is woven is smoothly to the story. One fault I would pick is that the dialogue is, in places, a bit clunky. It doesn't detract much from the story, but can jar at times. I am looking forward to reading more in this series.

This year, luckily, I got in an Ancient Egypt-mood, and I finally decided to pick it up.Overall Hand of Isis was a very enjoyable read. I thought the setting was especially well done: while it was very descriptive and detailed, it didn't feel too dense, and it truly gave a sense of the historical period. There were also quite a lot informations about the cult of Isis and, while I wasn't overly interested in this, it might be fascinating to other readers.I also really liked that this take on Cleopatra's story was narrated by Charmian, who is not only her handmaiden but her sister too. The sisterly relationship between them was really well written, and it humanized Cleopatra. As a character, Charmian was also quite likeable, even if not particularly memorable; as for Cleopatra, I would have liked her to be more charismatic. She was fine, but sometimes she seemed overly good, and it wasn't always easy to see what was so captivating about her. Instead I really appreciated the portrayals of Caesar and Mark Antony, they were both spot-on and intriguing.All in all, I am glad I finally gave this book a chance.

Who doesn\u2019t like cheap books? At the time I hadn\u2019t quite given in to the call of the romance section so I most likely found this one in the sci-fi/fantasy area just kind of hanging out. It\u2019s set in ancient Egypt, you say? Cleopatra is all up in this? Yes, please.Ancient Egypt is just too much of a draw for me to pass up.It fills me with chagrin that I stopped reading this one. It really does. From a history standpoint it\u2019s all well and good (despite some of the liberties Graham took). Too bad this isn\u2019t a history text. It\u2019s fiction. So despite my love of this era of history if I pick up a book that\u2019s supposed to be fiction I NEED to have relatable characters, an intriguing plot and something I can latch on to other than my obsession with the past.Graham knows her stuff. And she makes sure you know it too judging by the inordinate amount of minutiae that gets spit out in this book. Just random facts that a lover of the era would know but are otherwise irrelevant to the plot and whose only purpose is to show how much the author knows. Glorious.And then there\u2019s Charmian. A character that just rides the wave of the plot like a damn surfboard. I don\u2019t like plots that bend to a character\u2019s will. It just ends up coming off as so contrived and fake that it\u2019s hard to read. What\u2019s equally difficult to read is a plot with a character that does absolutely nothing, that just moves along because time runs its course and she has no choice but to move with it. She doesn\u2019t do much of anything, she doesn\u2019t have all that profound of an effect on the characters (Cleopatra, yes, only because Charmian was actually her body slave according to history) and she doesn\u2019t serve a purpose other than telling a piece of history through barely different eyes.The story is about Cleopatra. Charmian\u2019s life revolves around her so it\u2019s pretty hard to get away from that. But it feels like the author really wanted to write a book from the perspective of Cleopatra but, you know, EVERYONE\u2019S done that so let\u2019s try something different. Except Cleopatra is such an overwhelming presence that to attempt to write what is basically her story (because Charmian doesn\u2019t really have her own) from the eyes of a slave who is around her almost constantly is going to be a little difficult. Charmian is just a mouthpiece for the tale and comes off as little more than that.I did start to get a little interested when a more mystical element was introduced but it came and went pretty quickly and I was dropped back into a story that was riding Cleopatra\u2019s coattails. I really tried to keep reading and I got halfway through but I just got so bored with it. If you\u2019re going to give me a history text, give me a history text. But if you\u2019re going to give me a work of fiction then stop relying on history to be your motivating premise and shoving your characters into the mix like some random piece of historical fanfiction.And to do next to nothing with it . . . the short excerpts with Charmian at the gates waiting to be judged were interesting but nowhere near enough to keep me invested in the story. If you\u2019re going to talk history at me don\u2019t cloak it in \u201cfiction\u201d and pretend you wrote an awesome story. You didn\u2019t. This is history with a hand puppet. It\u2019s not a backdrop where greater, more plot-centric and original events took place. It is the book and the more I think about it the angrier I get. It doesn\u2019t have much of anything original in it and is wholly dependent on what happened in history in order to further the plot. If you remove it, you don\u2019t have a story. I\u2019ve read other historically set books that use the setting as just that, a backdrop for a nominally related story. This is taking history and going, OMG look what I wrote! No. You didn\u2019t write this. History wrote it. You just decided to write some fanfiction on it but ended up doing little more then reciting the events as they happened.I need to stop or I\u2019ll just keep ranting. There\u2019s a difference between historical fiction with the backdrop of history and original elements for the plot and simply regurgitating history from the point of view of a random person in the thick of the event in question and calling it a novel."}], "description": "Against the rising power of Rome, Egypt is the last and strongest bastion of the Eastern Hellenistic kingdoms.
