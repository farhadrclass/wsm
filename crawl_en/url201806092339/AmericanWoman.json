Several passages drone on with internal narratives focused on infinitesimal details, which actually serve to draw the reader away from the characterization of the protagonists instead of giving profound insights into their thoughts and feelings. More minor characters end up being more interesting - Miss Dolly and Jenny/Wendy's father, for instance - because they retain some mystery. I am glad to have read this book, and to have learned more about this fascinating episode in American culture, but Choi would have benefited from some serious editing."}, {"userName": "Jessica Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221331-jessica-baxter", "userReview": "the patty hearst story, told from the point of view of her asian-american female captor turned partner in crime. a stunningly written book about assimilation, radicalism, female relationships, romantic relationships, road trips, guns, survival, race, class and gender. just fucking great."}, {"userName": "Derek Emerson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/638139-derek-emerson", "userReview": "This is the type of book I typically avoid, but before I had a chance to run I was drawn in by this engrossing account of one fugitive trying to help three more people continue their evasion of the police. I was not far into the book (okay, chapter two) when I realized I was in a fictional account of the Patty Hearst story. For those younger than myself, Hearst is the grandaughter of media giant William Randolph Hearst (see: Kane, Citizen) who was kidnapped by the unknown SLA in 1974, then became devoted to their cause and turned to robbing banks. All but three of the SLA were killed in a shootout and Hearst was arrested about a year later.But Choi avoids some simple fictionalized version of an already bizarre event (this is a time when the idea of truth being stranger than fiction is clearly true). Instead, the \"American Woman\" is Jenny Shimada, a Japanese-American who is in hiding because of her interest in bomb making, which has put her boyfriend in jail. Shimada has been avoiding exposure by living in a small town doing renovation work for an older woman. Now she is recruited to help these three and we quickly see that all \"radicals\" are not cut from the same cloth. While she likes to blow up buildings, she does so when no one is in them and she makes sure they belong to the government. The SLA members have kidnapped an heiress and are as interested in armed warfare as they are about their principles, which seem stretched at best.Choi does not judge any of her characters and all are especially well drawn. Shimada is a complex person who seems to have it all figured out one minute, and is completely lost the next. In other words, she is a real person (and yes, she too is based on a real person). Pauline, the Patty Hearst of the story, is interesting not because she is supposed to by Hearst, but because we see how someone taken out of their element and thrown into the extreme opposite responds. She goes from pampered college student to bound, blindfolded, and gagged in closet for days. Her relationship with two of her captors is abusive and dependent, yet she is also drawn to Jenny. What she is not drawn to is her past life -- at one point her and Jenny drive by her old house, but she has no desire to return. That part of her life is gone.Which raises the question of what happens when we do disappear. When they are captured (oops, late spoiler alert for those who did not guess it) they refer to Pauline's year of hiding as \"the lost year.\" But who lost the year? Pauline certainly did not. This plays out as a modern version of if a tree falls in the woods does it make a sound? Choi is playing with the idea of how our lives are and are not dependent on others involved with us, others viewing us, and others we pass by in life. While it seems obvious that losing track of others does not mean they have lost themselves, we often make that assumption -- \"they fell off the face of the earth.\" As Choi is showing, life continues even when the circumstances change. Jenny and Pauline disappear for different reasons, their circumstances both change, and they themselves change, but that does not equate with being lost. But it does raises questions about how we define ourselves when those around us who do define us are gone. What makes make Jenny who she is and which is the \"real\" Pauline.Choi's prose is full and worth a slow read. The book is cinematic in its layout and she paints clear pictures everywhere she goes. The last section of the book loses some of the hold after the tension has disappeared, but it adds another interesting note to the story in comparing how fame impacts what should be similar situations for two people.Finally, we can return to Choi's title and spend time defining the two words of the title -- American and woman. In what ways is a Japanese-American raised in Japan for many years and an acknowledged bomber of American government properties an American? As the story unfolds the ideas of \"woman\" are also explored with a range of options considered. In other words, Choi leaves us a lot to think about."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/274908-jen", "userReview": "This book is a fictionalized work about the SLA and Wendy Yoshimura's life. The author's research about the 1970s--its events and both mainstream and radical ideologies--was impeccable, giving great insight into the era. Choi does a great job in developing Jenny's character. I also walked away from the book with a greater understanding of the Patti Hearst story through her portrayal of the character Pauline and a glimpse of what it was like to live in one of the Japanese internment camps through the experiences of Mr. Shimada. Some questions I have for Choi involve the Juan and Yvonne characters (based on William and Emily Harris of the SLA). Although both characters are supposed to be radical revolutionaries capable of violent behavior, I thought the characters appeared silly when they were in hiding with their exercising, self-imposed rules, and crazy logic. Was it Choi's intention for them to appear this way? Was she trying to show how Jenny saw them? If so, maybe this was why it was so self-defeating for Jenny to realize she wasn't any different from them?This is a good read. I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5978764-amanda", "userReview": "American Woman is very well written, besides being extremely insightful and thought-provoking from both a psychological development and a political-historic perspective. Though it may seem strange to compare a woman of Korean decent with the achitypical Jewish-American writer, I see many parallels between Choi's book and the writing of Philip Roth. One of these was that the writing style is complex and rich enough to slow me down, something I respect a lot in a book. The language is beautiful and complexly crafted so that I was forced to spend more time thinking about the central themes. Choi's book also reminded me of Roth's The Plot Against America, being a novel based on historical fact which explores the American psyche in mass and individually. American Woman is centers around a group of violent political activists in the late 60s and early 70s that kidnaps the young-adult daughter of a wealthy, well known family. A la Patty Hurst, the woman joins her captors and works with them to rob banks, escape the police, etc. At first I was worried that these characters, being based on real people (perhaps portrayed as they were by the mass media) would be charicature-ish or symbolic. On the contrary, Choi wears the events on which her novel is based as a loose garment, allowing them to provide a basic structure for the development of complex and sympathetic characters and explore issues of radicalism, feminism, revolution, and maturity. She explores in great depth the emotions and thoughts of a woman (Jenny) changing from a self-assured idealistic youth to a more realistic, hardened young adult who accepts consequences and sees her actions in a layered, realistic way. I think that this book struck a particular chord with me because of my experiences over the past three years teaching, especially now that I have decided to leave the \"battlefield.\" In the book, Jenny feels a lot of guilt for wanting beauty and comfort in her life because she has thought for so long of these as unnecessary indulgences. I identify with many of these transitional feelings."}, {"userName": "Claire S.", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/649105-claire-s", "userReview": "Drunk with the bitter decaf tea of realization that my own writing is hopelessly amateur next to Choi's almost magical ability to shift between present/future/past, to manically pursue granular underpinnings while making broad brush strokes.It's a fictional account riffing off the Patty Hurst kidnapping and bank robbery and Underground Weathermen bombings - it wasn't this way but it could have been.

This novel is a historically relevant psychological portrait of young radicals at different points in their lives.

It begins about a man who loved a woman, and whose love she didn\u2019t return; its final line is about a man whose love she is only beginning to return. Further, the protagonist \u201cshe\u201d is often nameless, referred to by a pronoun rather than Jenny Shimada, even when she is only just entering a scene. Titling concerns aside, the book is a mostly engaging meditation on race, identity, family, class, love, loyalty. It follows the story of young fugitive Jenny as she unwillingly hides younger, more violent and arguably more radical fugitives whose fight is less clear, less directed than Jenny's was against the Vietnam War. Susan Choi graces the surface of 1970s radical left-wing politics but never digs beyond\u2014a mention of Vietnam here, a mention of class warfare there, references to racism and bigotry scattered throughout. But it is not a book about politics, and even her characters only seem to understand their intensely passionate views in a youthful, superficial way. It is hard to know what point Choi makes in those moments when we see the ways in which the radicals contradict their own fight, or when we see their subtle realizations that they have impacted little, if any, positive change. It is up to the reader to continue the meditation. The narrative reveals past, present, and sometimes future moments at once so that we piece together the lives, identities, and thoughts of Jenny and the characters intertwined in her life in bits and pieces as the story progresses.

She was kidnapped by an terrorist group and eventually joined and participated in their cause. This fictionalized perspective from Choi changes the names and a few details but uses the structure of the true story. *spoiler alert*Jenny Shimada, whose father was imprisoned in the Japanese internment camps, narrowly missed getting captured by the police after her radical group blew up an empty government building. She goes into hiding and is conscripted into watching over three \"comrades\" who are also running from the law, the last survivors post a brutal police shoot out. It is interesting to me that so much has been written about Patty Hearst and less about her co-conspirators (compare the lines in WIKI about Patty and about Wendy, for example). It is almost as if the media shaped the story (and thus the history) of an event - Patty makes a good story b/c she's a rich girl who goes radical - would the story have played out if Patty were a poor black woman? Highly unlikely, which is infuriating. Much has been written and researched about whether Patty was brain washed or whether she was truly converted; this is the difference in the eyes of the law between a strong or a more lenient sentence. It is also interesting how long they remained fugitives from the law - this book fills in the gaps and focuses on the other members; Patty remains a mystery; it is unclear where her loyalty lies. The book also tackles the subject of radicalism; it is fascinating how young all the radials are, all in their twenties; Pauline was kidnapped when she was 19. They are self-righteous and obsessed with equality; somehow in parallel they believe that stealing is OK, even from the middle-class, because their cause is just, even if others do not see it as such. These young people were opposed to the choices being made by their government; they decided to use violence against violence; many died. They spend a lot of time talking and discussing and planning; Choi takes the time to show the reader this \"low\" period instead of focusing just on the violence; she shows the vulnerable, self-doubting as well as the peacocking. Just like the actual SLA, many of the remaining members were female, which is interesting.What form does this radicalization take today? Occupy Wall Street? Protests against police violence? I always find these public, non-violent attempts to foster change as uplifting - signs that people actually care about the world around them. What would I fight for?Very strong writing. The disjointed story line worked - it kept this reader on edge. Choi gets into the heads of her characters and makes them ultimately compelling; she nails humanity in ways that other fiction I've read recently does and cannot. She is tackling big themes. I look forward to reading her other books. I believe Patty and Jenny are still alive; I'd love to know what they thought of this book.Patty Hearst = PaulineWendy Yoshimura = JennyBill and Emily Harris = Juan and Yvonne"}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "I was assigned to read this for a class, which means that I was basically guaranteed to hate it. (I have a bad history with required reading - see Summer of My German Soldier and The Old Man and the Sea)The story focuses on Jenny Shimada, who is based on a real Japanese-American woman who worked for the SLA in the 70's and was involved in the Patty Hearst kidnapping. American Woman is a fictional account of what happened in the time between Patty Hearst joining her captors and the group being arrested. Hearst is in the book but is referred to as \"Pauline\" because I guess Susan Choi didn't want to get sued. The parts of the story where Choi describes the activities of the SLA and how they evade the authorities are really interesting - because of this book, I now know how to travel across the US without getting caught by the feds - but everything else in the book basically sucks. Choi starts out the story from the perspective of some random SLA guy, and then suddenly switches the story to Jenny's point of view. Also, nearly every single character was either obnoxious or anger-inducing. Jenny seems to have been born without a personality, Rico and Yvonne (2 SLA fighters who kidnapped Pauline/Patty) are so annoying with all their \"bring down the bourgeois\" crap that I kept waiting for someone to punch them in the face, and don't even get me started on Pauline. Here's the thing: the big mystery of the Patty Hearst kidnapping is that no one knows if Patty actually believed in what the SLA preached, or if she was just faking it to survive. You'd think, that if someone was to write a fictional account of the kidnapping, the author would answer this question, right?Wrong. I never, throughout the entire book, understood why Pauline even got up in the morning, much less knew how she thought or if she really believed in the SLA's ideals. Choi focuses too much attention on Jenny and never lets her audience into Pauline's head - ironically, she was the only one I really wanted to understand. Also: the random episodes with Jenny's father and how he used to live in a Japanese internment camp were pointless and influenced the plot in no way. I think the only reason Choi even made Jenny's father a character in the story is because she needed to write her crap ending that came out of nowhere. Honestly, this is basically how the book ends:Jenny: so I got arrested for kidnapping Pauline, but then I got released after a few months and so I went to reunion at Manzanar with my dad. The end!When I read that and realized the story was over, it made me want to throw the book into a food processor.Read for: Freshman Year Seminar"}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8653905-diana", "userReview": "American Woman is a fictionalized version of Patty Hearst's time in hiding with the members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. In case you were born after 1974, Hearst was kidnapped by the SLA. The group made certain strange demands from Hearst's very wealthy family, but was never satisfied with their responses. After some time, the group robbed a bank, and Patty appeared to be an active participant in he heist, rather than a hostage. A shootout with the SLA followed, with only two members and Hearst surviving. This is where the story in American Woman begins.While the name \"Patty Hearst\" was familiar to me, I was young enough when the true story unfolded that I didn't remember all of the details. Choi stayed very close to the truth in her telling, but changed the names and invented dialogue. Patty, who wanted to be called \"Tania\" in real life is called \"Pauline\" in the book. A fact that I never knew was one of the people in hiding with Patty was a Japanese American woman named Wendy Yoshimura. In the book, Wendy is named Jenny Shimada, and the story is told from her perspective. Wendy/Jenny was completely overlooked by the press at the time. She was born during World War II, while her Japanese parents were living in an internment camp within the US. Growing up, Jenny's father faced hard times, not feeling like he had a place in either the US or Japan. As a teenager, Jenny lived in California, and found friends who were discontent with the government and wanted to make a statement. Jenny joined their protests, and soon found herself in over her head. As Jenny's time with Pauline came to a close, Asian Americans came to her aid in a way that Jenny neither expected nor felt that she deserved. Those Asian Americans, and not just Japanese Americans, did everything within their power to help Wendy in real life. Choi, who Wikipedia says is half Korean, is another Asian American keeping us from forgetting Wendy Yoshimura's name.The story in American Woman is a little slow. This only makes sense, as Jenny and Pauline are supposed to be in hiding and keeping a low profile. Choi explores the question that the American public struggled with during the Patty Hearst trial: Was Patty/Pauline a hostage or a willing participant? If she was a willing participant, why was that, and does she deserve to be punished for her role? Choi doesn't pick sides in Patty's story, but she is clearly a strong supporter of Wendy.To read more of this review, please click here: http://sonotarunner.blogspot.com/2014..."}, {"userName": "Thurston Hunger", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/270341-thurston-hunger", "userReview": "The early vague sense of a stalker following his prey (or unrequited or just unreturned love) gives way to an account of the Patty Hearst kidnapping. I actually read this for book club, so did not even know that was the vehicle for this novel.And at least my edition surely shies away from trumpeting or even mentioning that connection. Perhaps as we are supposed to focus on the Wendy Yoshimura character, but she is drawn pretty much with blank thoughts, a bit of a repressed memory of her family/father (the most intersting subplot going here) and a idealistic pining for her imprisoned boyfriend.We are repeatedly told how much she loves and longs for him, but never really get to feel much of that. Similarly the time on the lam with the Symbionese \"army\" has a lot of atmospheric passion, with precious little prose to back it up. Their communiques and writing perhaps omitted for legal purposes, or author's intention to drive our focus instead to....to.....To what?Towards the moping denoument of Wendy and Patty going Thelma and Louise but instead back to Berkeley and their apartment garden peace.And to me the crucial moment where Wendy (I know I'm not using their psuedonyms here) decides not to abandon Patty (or Tanya or Pauline), that felt like it did not follow at all with the previous depiction of events in the book. Again the story tying the rebellion of the time and the SLA against the Japanese internment of Wendy's father (in reality the real Wendy was evidently BORN in such a camp) that is quite interesting. The Wendy character just doesn't command much attention, it fails even compared to the Patty character, who was pretty hard to take, especially when she was around her comrades. Likely as the author, like many of us, doesn't exactly know what to make of Patty during that time. Even after Larry King interviews and such, it feels like she was more complicated if not complicit, than what she herself claims now.Is the moral of the story, children should be seen and not Hearst?Anyways, the SLA (people attacking the govt) versus Manzanar (govt attacking people) is at best loosely juxtaposed here and not really probed, or illuminated. All making for an extremely unrewarding read for myself, as is often the case on \"based on a true story\" work."}, {"userName": "Felice", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2507841-felice", "userReview": "American Woman is by Susan Choi and was published by HarperCollins about 5/6 years ago.

I'm also wondering about who my neighbors might really be after reading American Woman. That isn't a question that has ever occurred to me before. I've lived here forever. My neighbors have lived here a long time and a half. What could I not know by now, right?Choi has taken one of our most famous kidnapping cases, transplanted it, explored it and turned it in to an achingly jarring novel. A young American terrorist is given 3 younger terrorists to care for while they hide out from authorities. The way love and loyalties get danced around within these characters lives is like looking at an Escher print. There is no way to find a place to land and then a way out. Normal life is the jumping off point in this novel and psychologically unsettling is where you're headed.This is no sensationalized E True Hollywood Story in book form. This is a page turner where the action and the ideas vie for your attention. Choi does a magnificent job of keeping any moral judgments out of American Woman.

One of my favorite books I have read this year. It has everything I seek from a good story - gripping plot, beautiful, spare writing, race and gender stuff explored with subtlety and truth. The grand machinations of history playing out in individuals' lives and relationships. The characters are grappling with how to truly live moral lives in a stained and violent world. No surprise: some of them are assholes whose solutions are strikingly similar to the original problem. Plus a compelling, complex female protagonist, whose compassion and pacifism drive her to commit acts of \"terrorism\" some would deem violent. As someone who asks myself the same questions the characters in this book ask themselves - how should we live? how can we end the violence our society inflicts on people, at home and abroad? - I relished every moment of this novel, exploring the messy, complicated answers and the painful process of working through them. This book will probably spur a Patty Hearst/1970s San Francisco radical lesbian feminist reading binge.

Choi's book is broadly based on one of the more well-known 20th century kidnappings, that of Patricia Hearst who famously came to sympathize with her captors (a phenomenon known as the Stockholm syndrome) and joined them in committing a bank robbery. Choi's fictional account, though, actually focuses more on a different character. Jenny, a young woman of Japanese descent, takes on the task of keeping the escaped members of the revoluationary cadre 'safe,' something the members themselves generally fail to appreciate. Jenny is an incredibly complex character whose emotional response to living on the lam, exploring the impulses of youth, facing her weaknesses and motives and humanity, provides the reader with a powerful template for understanding the context of an important era in American experience and for considering the ways in which we are all products of our personal and political histories."}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10196629-beverly", "userReview": "This was such an intriguing book.

And in every scene, the natural environs, weather, and even wildlife at times became minor characters that subtly set the mood for the action and provided such a vivid sense of place that you could feel yourself there, among the cadre and on the run. I am a bit too young to have experienced with full awareness the period in which this story takes place, but the radical political calls of that time still echo today though the bombs are falling elsewhere and injustice and inequality have taken new forms.

American Woman, this gifted writer's second book, is a novel of even greater scope and dramatic complexity, about a young Japanese-American radical caught in the militant underground of the mid-1970s.When 25-year-old Jenny Shimada steps out of the Rhinecliff train station in New York's Hudson Valley, the last person she expects to see is Rob Frazer, a shadowy figure from her previous life. On the lam for an act of violence against the American government, Jenny agrees to take on the job of caring for three younger fugitives whom Frazer has spirited out of California. One of them, the granddaughter of a wealthy newspaper magnate in San Francisco, has become a national celebrity. Kidnapped by a homegrown revolutionary group, Pauline shocked America when she embraced her captors' ideology, denouncing family and class to enlist in their radical cell.American Woman unfolds the story of Jenny and her charges -- Pauline, Juan, and Yvonne, the remains of the busted revolutionary cadre -- as they pursue their destinies from an old farmhouse in upstate New York back to California. Provocative, suspenseful, and often wickedly comic, the novel explores the psychology of the young radicals -- outsiders all -- as isolation and paranoia inevitably undermine their ideals.
