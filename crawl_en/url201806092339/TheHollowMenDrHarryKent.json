However, with a premise that sounded like a unique blend of urban noir and a conspiracy theory all set against the combustible backdrop of the inner London housing estates which are notorious through their connections to gangland culture, The Hollow Men sounded like an innovative thriller. Wyndham Road, SE5, a suspect believed to be seventeen-year-old Solomon Idris from the nearby Albany estate walks into a Chicken Hut, orders his food, sits and then withdraws a gun and shoots once into the air. Taking his fellow customers and the shop workers as hostages he demands a lawyer and a BBC reporter from the police that are on the scene. Before any of this can come to pass, DI Frankie Noble of Southwark CID strikes a deal with an ailing Idris, offering him a qualified doctor in exchange for the release of the hostages.When DI Noble rouses Harry Kent after coming off duty that morning from a shift working as the ICU registrar at the John Ruskin University Hospital, and reports a 'situation' with no one injured at present, Kent pops an amphetamine and heads out of the door to attend. No one appreciates the misnomer behind his job title of 'police surgeon' more than Dr. Harry Kent, officially titled the Force Medical Examiner. The bread and butter day to day jobs of his responsibilities err to the more pedestrian tasks of dealing with minor injuries and verifying if an individual is fit to be questioned. Hostage situations are not on that list... As Harry Kent enters the takeaway he immediately sees that Idris is suffering, struggling with laboured breathing, a sheen of sweat across his brow and Kent knows that the matter is life-threatening and an oxygen cylinder is needed. A noise outside the takeaway causes the armed police to charge in suspecting Idris has opened fire and further endanger his life but not before he has told Harry his reason for protesting being that \"they\" killed Keisha and the police don't care. Accompanying Idris to A&E, Kent begins to suspect that attempts on Solomon's life are being orchestrated in the critical care ward and starts to think that maybe he knew far too much for someone's liking and his demise would ensure he never speaks out. Working alongside colleagues including former best friend, Dr. James Lahiri working a locum shift in A&E and a senior consultant who is largely an academic, these are people that Harry Kent respects. With so many involved in the day to day duties of staffing a critical care ward, Harry can afford to trust no one, from passing nurses to those who occupy the very highest echelons. The eyes of Solomon Idris, old before their years, haunt Harry and he refuses to let the matter drop, whether with police support or on his own.A fairly slow starter to take hold, The Hollow Men only gripped me at about a third of the way through. Prior to this I was torn between persevering onward through the initially dense medical terminology or giving up on the novel. Fortunately my own chequered medical history proved a boon, and having had a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) and spell on a trauma ward this afforded me a sketchy understanding of the fight to save Solomon's life. Undoubtedly there is a trade-off with medical jargon being entirely necessary to make the hospital activity plausible, and reading like a medical textbook which threatens to alienate the average reader. Reading about the fight to save Idris's life alone is only so interesting and with no clear direction for the plot taking shape until well through this novel The Hollow Men felt somewhat laborious.As a local boy made good, complete with his own brushes with the law as a teenager, Dr. Harry Kent has returned from a life as an army medic battling the atrocities in Afghanistan. His spell on the frontline ended with former best friend and fellow army doctor, James Lahiri, saving his life. Dr. Lahiri now spends two nights a week as the emergency doctor at the Ruskin and working as a GP at the surgery with an ongoing gang initiative which counts Idris as a patient, but Kent and Lahiri are no longer on speaking terms. As regards the motive in choosing his post army career and changing from a youthful scorn of the force to working on their behalf, the answer becomes clear when readers see Harry visiting the pink haired young girl he has named Zara, an unidentified female who was brought in with her life hanging in the balance in the aftermath of the 2011 London riots. Kent transferred his energies into seeing Zara identified and her family informed of her condition and much of his naive belief is that throughout his contact with police personnel he will be able to inspire his contacts to take up the cause, all a diversion amid his guilt and self-loathing about his betrayal of the man he has to thank for saving his life, James Lahiri.For all the energy and admirable style surrounding this debut, there was still something fairly prosaic about the plot. Overly twee, and keen to paint Dr. Harry Kent as the knight in shining armour, a beacon of truth and positivity amongst a largely apathetic landscape where everyone else was only too willing to give up on the disenfranchised youths of the South London inner city estates. From the Saviour Project attempting to tackle the gang culture at Lahiri's practice the preaching school assembly, for all the talk of innovative storylines there was still something too predictable about the story of a local fighting the battles and protecting those less fortunate than himself. Kent, with his own demons, most notably his speed addiction and his nightmares from Afghanistan feels like the almost obligatory burdened character who singlehandedly upholds justice. I lost count of the number of life saving interventions made by his character and my interest waned as the novel drew to a close. The simplicity with which Kent tracked down a gun dealer and approached him alone with ease and in such a casual manner also proved a little too saccharine sweet to be plausible.The story is narrated entirely in the third person and takes the form of a diary, detailing the day to day happenings and the pace is intense, as befitting a situation where lives hang in the balance. The gallows humour was splendidly delivered and insights from the medical frontline added moments of sparkle, including a personal favourite revealing that the CT scan is termed 'the doughnut of death'. Unfortunately taking roughly one third of the novel for the plot to become clear and a ludicrous diversion of Harry being considered a viable suspect that was over extenuated, The Hollow Men felt like an awful lot of effort for a limited reward. This novel is the first in a planned Dr. Harry Kent series and I will be interested to see where Harry ventures next and whether he remains a police surgeon."}, {"userName": "Bonnye Reed", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10604067-bonnye-reed", "userReview": "GNAB I received a free electronic copy of this novel from Netgalley, Rob McCarthy, and Pegasus Books in exchange for an honest review.

I loved receiving a review copy of this book, Can you believe it actually arrived in a First aid box.\u200bThat is probably because at the end of this book it's quite possible you will need a Dr.\u200bIt kicks off brilliantly, right into the story, right into the action. Dr Harry Kent is just brilliant. He cares about other people in a big way. I can see that this is going to continue as a series of books, that you just can't wait for the next one, This series is going to be fanbloodytastic.\u200bI believe this is actually a debut, I was shocked to learn that. It's written like it has been done by a long time writing author. Medical student Rob McCarthy is currently working on 2 more stories to feature Harry Kent. How good is that?\u200bWe are taken right into siege in a London Take away shop right from the opening pages, the action starts and it carries on from there. Solomon Idris has a gun and Hostages, yet Harry An ex Army Medic and now a part time police surgeon, is sent in to help Solomom Idris. It becomes clear early on that Idris is not well at all, in fact he's very poorly, but Harry can't seem to make him understand that he needs hospital treatment. Things soon start to go wrong, very wrong when Idris is shot and rushed to hospital.\u200bIt seems that Harry feels he has been set up, and as he continues to try and help, things start to become clear that all is not as it seems. And this is just the start. The fact that Harry is a Police Dr rather that an actual copper gives this book it's edge, it's great to see something a little different. With him being a Dr there is a fair bit of medical jargon, but all explained or easy to understand so it doesn't put you off in any way at all. Harry is also an ex Soldier so has some of his own issues to contend with through life.\u200b\u200bDi Nobel also features quite a lot in this book, and it was great to see her and Harry trying to put things together and help each other. It turned out that they make a great duo.\u200bi'm really not sure I could say enough about this book to get across how much I really did enjoy it. It is well worth reading, it's upto date and thrilling and you will not be disappointed with it at all. Rob McCarthy is certainly an author to watch out for if this first book is anything to go by."}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7052436-gail", "userReview": "Saw an outstanding review for this debut thriller in a national newspaper and downloaded it to my Kindle (raising an eyebrow at the steep price) and quickly finished the book I was reading so I could commence this.It has all the things I love about a book, medical jargon, murder, mystery, intrigue and a little romance along the way. Dr Harry Kent (Police Surgeon) receives a phone call from DI (Frances) Frankie Noble to attend an incident at a takeaway called the Chicken Hut where a 17 year old male (Solomon Idris) is holding staff and customers hostage at gun point. When Harry eventually gets into the shop, he builds up some kind of rapport with the very deeply troubled Solomon, who tells him that he is 'doing this for Keisha' and asking for a lawyer. Harry quickly realises that Solomon is very ill as he's having serious coughing and breathing problems and starts to treat him. Sadly, at that point, something goes terribly wrong with the whole situation and Solomon is critically injured. (No spoilers).Solomon is rushed to the hospital where Harry also works as a Registrar, and the team battle to save the life of Solomon. Things take a sinister turn for the worse and Harry realises that Solomon's life is in danger. He doesn't know why, but he sets out to find out, ultimately putting himself in danger from whom he does not know. Harry is a tortured soul having been seriously injured in Afghanistan and only surviving as his old friend (James Lahiri) had saved him and their commanding officer. James and Harry haven't spoken for a year and we soon find out why. Harry lives for his work but sadly living each day on amphetamines, just to battle on through. Frankie has some personal issues of her own, but she supports Harry completely and she has her own methods of bending the Police rules in trying to get her man. I felt the book was overlong and there was an awful lot of repetition, which made it a little tiresome for me in places. Generally though I liked Harry and Frankie and as the book ends so abruptly I'm hoping this leaves a nice little opener for a sequel. I would love to see how Harry and Frankie's professional and personal relationship (hopefully) develops as they both need some happiness in their lives. With a bit of a nip and a tuck here and there I'm hoping this could be a great series."}, {"userName": "Tracy Terry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7331397-tracy-terry", "userReview": "Used to reading US Police Procedurals , it was refreshing to read one set in Southwark, England, and not just any Southwark, England ...With its backdrop of inner city housing estates notorious for their gangland culture this is a gritty read in which Intensive Care Registrar, Harry Kent, gets caught up in an incident.A strong debut novel.

Kent is a police surgeon and The Hollow Men is that rare beast: a medical thriller. Because his job is essentially to be on hand to treat injuries, his role as a solver of criminal mysteries is somewhat restricted. This could be a structural problem, if this book is the first in a Harry Kent series. But as a major conspiracy appears to be in the offing he can discard such niceties as the Data Protection Act and the GMC's ethics code and hack medical records, bust into flats, and cajole confessions from schoolchildren all with the connivance of a embittered policewoman whom he begins sleeping with. The procedural detail is all there, and McCarthy does not shy from medical jargon, assuming the reader's familiarity by now with Casualty, ER or Holby City. But the plot is clunky and formulaic.

Rob McCarthy has found a new follower. I was hooked from the first chapter on. Game out with a shotgun blast. Whenever the book slowed down it was only to reload. There were no poorly written characters, just some I wish I could have learned more about. The main protagonist Dr. Harry Kent is damaged. Partly by upbringing, partly by war, and partly by is own stupidity. As is the case in our own lives there is always more to know. A man driven by his guilt, remorse, sense of right and wrong, and his past. A good recipe to relate to for many. The turmoil that starts with a young man holding hostages for an unknown reason starts Harry down a path where much is exposed but not always in the right direction. Having spent time in an ER and an ICU the hospital scenes play out quite nicely. The sense of urgency, the immediacy of every decision. One Doctors mistakes covered by another one. Multiple events that cascade down on the young man who throughout the book is either not all there or under an induced coma. But even he has a backstory. There is more to know about everyone. Everything is connected, even if just loosely. Decisions and actions dictated by past events ring true. Multiple story lines that should be examined in future books are laid out for us. Within this book we see how poverty and those looking to use these broken youth are not far apart. I good go on with the Kudos but I'd be repeating myself. I wish there had been more insight into some of the characters because going forward they can't have much impact other than to give Harry more depth. But this is nitpicking on my part.
