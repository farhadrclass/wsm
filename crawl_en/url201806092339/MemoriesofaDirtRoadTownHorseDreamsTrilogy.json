It has action, romance, horses, and its christian fiction to top it all off. Rarely do I find all those qualities in a christian fiction book!!!Positives - The main character`s faith is strengthened, Lessons can be learned, and the moral of the story, that we cannot run from our fears forever!Negatives - You never find out which guy she chooses....  Life is so meaningless to Develyn Worrell. After the death of her ex husband and the blame of his death on Develyn by her twenty-one year old daughter, Develyn must escape to the place of her youth in a little dirt road town in Wyoming. She drives off in her jeep and heads out there with no idea where this place is located. Along the way she stops for a rest at a halfway diner. She meets a friend in the most unusual of places, and she is able to share her feelings with this unknown angel. With a refreshed head Develyn leaves the diner and gets back on the road. After some asking around ( and meeting a strange man who believes in aliens ) she is given a flyer for a horse auction. When she is totally at a loss to find her town she drives off to find this horse auction. To her surprise this town that the auction was in is the same town she remembers. Develyn transforms from this careful schoolteacher to an whitty, hard to catch,and daring cowgirl that gathers the attention of every cowboy out there. With these new attentions she feels as if she a woman again. At this mustang auction Develyn makes a new friend that is totally opposite her personality, and also at this auction she makes her first purchase of a skewbold mustang mare. After the auction she loads up her mustang and before she leaves she is invited to a invatation only party at a big ranch ( well known political leaders and actors attend also). The owner of this ranch catches her eye and He also feels something for her. Several men express their interest in her, but by the ending of this book it seems her interest stick with the big ranch owner. There is also an adventure in this book as Develyn makes a stupid decision to ride farther than she find her way back from. Her situation goes from bad to worse as her horse runs off with a herd of wild horses, it starts to rain, she meets two cattle rustlers, and they point a gun at her and her horse (on the edge of a cliff)..............................  I hope I have sparked your interest in this book and you will read the rest."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "This was my first Stephen Bly book and I was totally taken in with his writing right from the beginning. He is witty and funny and creates great characters but most importantly, he reminds us of God\u2019s love for us and His understanding that we are sinners who strive each and every day to do His will.In this story, Develyn Worrell is a widowed forty-five-year-old fifth grade school teacher from central Indiana. Her 22-year-old daughter, Delaney, is estranged from her because she feels Develyn\u2019s lack of forgiveness contributed to her father\u2019s sudden heart attack. With school being out for the summer and feeling lonely and out of sorts, Develyn decides to load up the car and drive to Wyoming from Indiana.When Develyn was ten, she and her family had vacationed in a small central Wyoming town and she decides to head there for the summer in hopes of recreating the experience she enjoyed so much on that vacation 35 years previously.What Develyn finds is not only her past, but her present and future as well. The cast of characters that help her along the way play a big part in helping her grow in herself and in her trust of God.I\u2019ll definitely be looking for more of Stephen Bly\u2019s books and would recommend this one to everyone!"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732142-erin", "userReview": "This is the modern-day trek of a 45-year-old Indiana schoolteacher to find the little Wyoming town where she spent her favorite vacation when she was 10. She thinks she's on a journey to recover from some hard turns in her life, but she has no idea what is in store. If these were not written by a man I would be tempted to call them western chic lit, but as it is they just happen to be so fun that you feel like you are right there, learning alongside Develyn as God helps her reconcile her past, learn from and embrace the now, and let Him be in charge of the future. I felt that the characters I could relate to were well-written and the relationships true-to-life... and you're missing out if you've never heard about a watch-burro. ;-) The two sequels help wrap up Devy's story."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4941004-lori", "userReview": "Very easy to read and heartwarming story about a woman going back to the place of a favorite childhood memory(family vacation)..she just takes off with no real plan(very brave)and by herself(not sure I could do that but would like to think I could) The main character is a middle aged school teacher who discovers who she is and most importantly...you have to find the joy in life!!! Live life!!! Most of the story did take place in Wyoming with horses which may be one of the reasons I liked it..(got some of that Wyoming clay dirt in my blood) The writing was ok.
