When she is proposed to by an 80 year old miner she runs away, following Marshal Dylan McCall to Wyoming. The book started out with a fun adventure/ romance theme, but then got a bit cheesey. The author is Christian, which is nice beacause it's clean, but when the Christian element of \"saving\" is introduced, the story kind of stopped there."}, {"userName": "Miss Clark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1467942-miss-clark", "userReview": "Yeah, I got nothing. That is how memorable this was for me after two months. And that was rereading after several years. There is a baby and they are on this wagon trail.

The last chapter, or last few pages, set up the beginning to Patience's book.It takes a tough stubborn person to survive Coloradan winters and Dylan McCall and Ruth Priggish are just such stubborn people. In Denver City, Ruth gave the impression to a 70 year old that she would be honored to marry him - so she must escape. She devises a plan to have Marshall McCall escort her to Wyoming, where a possible cousin lives. Unfortunately, Marshall McCall is not thrilled with the plan - so as Plan B, Ruth will follow him until he cannot drag her back to Denver City and leave her. The plan works, until a foggy day when Ruth literally bumps into Marshall McCall's horse and she's thrown into manure. Then she is left on her own with her horse, and though she wanders on, she has no idea where she is (Dylan was checking on her every day) until she comes to a burnt wagon and two men, shot with arrows. She was about to leave, when she heard a baby's cry. She rescued the baby, got burnt in the process, and checked both men to be sure they were dead. She found Dylan McCall with two arrows in his back, but the other man was dead. The book follows their adventures, cold, sick, tenacious, and hurting as they are. They eventually get to Sulfur Springs, and then to Deer Lick. It is the story of how two equally stubborn people who get on each others nerves begin to love and then recognize that love. The author leaves a note in the back, and shows that she knows her target audience. Many Christian families allow their teenage girls to read books such as these, so the note is an encouragement to wait on God's timing for their \"man of their hopes and dreams\", as well as about the series, the unknown, and how long she herself has been married."}, {"userName": "Lis K", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27017317-lis-k", "userReview": "This is the fifth book in the Brides of the West series. Books 1-3 in this series are about sisters whereas books 4-6 are about a group of young women who headed West to become mail-order brides. Although the events from book 4, Glory (Brides of the West Book 4) are summarized in the prologue, I think \"Glory\" should be read first because \"Ruth\" picks up right where \"Glory\" ended. Ruth gets a marriage proposal from an 80 year old miner. Not wanting to marry him, she decides to go to Wyoming (from Colorado) to seek refuge with her adoptive father's cousin. She seeks U.S. Marshall Dylan McCall's help to escort her to Wyoming. Of course he refuses because he is busy with his Marshall duties. Ruth decides to deceive him by following behind him and then revealing her presence once it is too late to make her return. At first, the story was pretty funny, especially the animosity---fueled by attraction---between Ruth and Dylan. Once they bump into each other (literally!) on the trail, that's when their problems really begin. The story turned pretty serious with all the difficulties they faced. I liked it though because this wasn't just a funny, flighty story but had real meaning and depth. The story felt relatively short but had a strong spiritual message woven throughout the book. Ruth had a strong relationship with God yet tended to try to fix problems on her own, even resorting to deceit at times. Dylan had a bad childhood living with a so-called Christian so he is not a believer. Yet as he and Ruth grow closer together during their harrowing journey, he learns that Ruth's God is different and can be trusted. The epilogue ends on a cliffhanger surrounding one of Ruth's fellow mail-order brides, Patience. Her dilemma begins the next book in the series, Patience (Brides of the West Book 6). Overall, I enjoyed this story---4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Sunshine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4442658-sunshine", "userReview": "I guess I liked the book fine, but it wasn't one of her better books. I'm just wondering how many of her leading females are going to threaten their men at gun point and still end up being loved and cherished by them by the end of the book. Ruth's situation didn't grab me as being sever enough to run away. She could have easily set things straight by announcing the misunderstanding. The old man was more annoying and silly than a fearful suitor. She wasn't in danger. Ruth was supposed to be this strong willed girl who could pull a gun on a large US Marshall and get what she wanted from him, but too frighten to stand up to a little old squirlly man wanting to marry her. She was inconsistent in her strengths. I wasn't sure how I felt about her. She was spunky, strong and hot tempered, but she was too helpless to detach herself from a silly old man. And then I didn't understand why Dylan being this strong US Marshall man would allow himself to be misused by Mr. Ford as though he was some grunt worker, not a man used to being in control. It wasn't as if Mr. Ford was uninformed that Dylan was a US Marshall, why would he try to take advantage of him. Mr. Ford wasn't arrogant, just a real lousy man. It just didn't add up. I disliked how long it took them to travel 20 miles, even in the snow. I felt impatient for them to finally reach the little town. However, I did like the scene in the beginning when Ruth is ticked at Dylan because he has refused to help her run away. She dowses him with a bucket of water and runs for her life before he catches her and drops her in the watering trough outside. There were some fun moments, so the book was okay. Maybe 2 1/2 or 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Kathy Heare Watts", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7640523-kathy-heare-watts", "userReview": "Another fine addition to the Brides of the West Series. You realize the grit these women had and the challenges they endured. I love mail-order bride books and western historical books. I realize how strong these women had to be. Ruth is a Christian young woman, just a teenager really who has had a hard life. Her parents and siblings died from Cholera when she was about four and they were traveling west. Found by Indians and taken and left at an orphanage to be raised. Adopted by a Christian couple who were teachers and then when her adopted mother died, her adopted father took her back and left her at the orphanage and she is abandoned again. Traveling with a group of five other mail order brides to Denver City, CO to find out that they have been tricked and sold into a mining camp, escape it. Taken in by the town minister and his wife until a groom comes along and then offered marriage by a man old enough to be her grandfather. I'd run too!! She takes off in the direction of Wyoming, tailing after Marshall McCall. They met up but he leaves her alone after she pulled a gun on him, his own gun. She finds him shot twice in the back with arrows along with another man dead and a baby crying in a burning wagon. The rest of the story and their encounters will have to be read. I loved the quote made by Marshall McCall, \"If wishes were pickles and buts were bread, you'd have a fine sandwich but nothing else.\"At the end of the book, we are set up for the 6th book of the series, Patience."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42942170-melissa", "userReview": "Ruth is, in my opinion, Copeland\u2019s greatest achievement of the series. I haven\u2019t, of course, read Patience, but in Ruth, Copeland comes to a completely new idea\u2014her character is not PERFECT! \u2013gasp!\u2013 Unlike all the other characters, who face minimal problems that will obviously be worked out in the future, Ruth faces a much bigger difficulty that she will cope with for the rest of her life, no matter what. She will never be able to have children. The thought is terrible and shockingly devastating to her. She thinks that no man will ever be able to love her in this condition. Enter \u201cpowerfully built, ruggedly handsome, blue eyed\u201d (coincidentally just like all of the other men in Copeland\u2019s stories) U.S. Marshall Dylan McCall, who thinks that no frilly, conniving woman is worth loving. But then he meets Ruth\u2014strong, stubborn, complex Ruth, who steals his heart and shows him a God who truly loves him, watches over him, and cares for him more than he can ever understand. Of course there is still the problem of Ruth\u2019s defect, but there\u2019s something about an imperfect life that makes the book much more real, and more endearing. The characters in this book are more developed than any of the others, and finally Copeland delivers characters who still have much to get through\u2014emotional scars from the past, etc., but they will do it together, and they will do it with the help of God. Beautiful. A suspenseful, funny, and romantic read."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1329275-kathryn", "userReview": "This series keeps getting better and better. I really enjoyed the characters. Ruth is the motherly, educated one on the ride to Colorado, but when she gets there she finds that she can't have children of her own and decides that she needs to make different plans for herself figuring that no man will love her if she can't give him children. I like how the author uses the example of pottery and how it has to be molded to become something beautiful and once it's baked it's set for life and how our lives are like that too, we need to be willing to be molded and shaped willing to move in different directions when necessary to find the end result. Ruth has to do that and have her plans for her life change with what she learns and experiences.Marshall McCall has had a sour experience with a woman, Sara who raised him with the understanding that all godly woman are as cruel and manipulative as she was. When he meets Ruth he finds that she shares love and is kind like the God she believes in.On their trek to Wyoming, the meet with bad weather, Indians, find and save a baby and form a family. Which they learn to accept and depend on. They marry and make a family for the Indian baby rose then head back to Colorado to recoup from their injuries.

It was sweet and challenging and Lori did a good job with the transformation of the relationship. It's refreshing to see relationships that start out at odds to develop rather than buck each other to the very end. Thank you, Lori!There were a couple of discrepancies that disappointed me. In Glory, Marshal McCall said he had two brothers, but in Ruth, he was an only child. Also, Harper turned out much different than I expected. Though she wasn't actually physically described in Glory that I can remember, Lori elludes to her being black in Ruth. That was a total shock. The first time her skin color was mentioned, it wasn't clear who Lori was referring to. Later toward the end of the book we find out that it's Harper.Other than that, great story!"}, {"userName": "Debbie West", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14438056-debbie-west", "userReview": "This book..#5 in Brides of the West series, isn't nearly as good as the previous four. As a Christian Romance, it carries the task of praying too far! Every Prayer was written out, as if the author couldn't make the story long enough in any other way. She obviously didn't! There was less action in this book than in any other Brides of the West books. Very little occurred in this story as Dylan & Ruth traveled the countryside, rescuing an Indian baby & asking couples to take it for their own. The rescue itself could have been stretched out but nope! The author spent more time in having Ruth pray at every turn of the page than she did on the events occurring.
