It's fine. But Melanie, who has had sex with multiple men, including one night stands (which makes me think that she's not so \"vanilla\" after all), seems to be completely clueless about her own body - AND SHE'S A FUCKING DOCTOR, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! She doesn't seem to know what she does or doesn't like during sex (and the one time she tells Jonah she doesn't like something, he turns into a petulant child), and she doesn't seem to be very active in their sexual relationship. And it's okay to be a passive partner - if that is what you want to be. But I never got the feeling that that is what Melanie WANTED - she was just stuck in this loop where she HAD to be passive, she HAD to be ignorant of her own body, and she HAD to just let Jonah do whatever the fuck he wanted to her and hope that he cared enough to get her off in the process.I mean, I'm closer to forty than I am to thirty, and I am light years ahead of this woman when it comes to sexuality, even though she's older than I am. And like I said - nothing wrong with being vanilla, nothing wrong with being passive - IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT. But I really can't believe that Melanie hasn't gotten a vibrator at some point in her life and discovered what BOB (or BOG) can do for her. Her sexual immaturity is just painful to read. Painful.

This is the 4th book in the Steel Brothers Saga, and what a saga it is! This book is about Jonah Steel and his struggles with the crushing guilt he feels about what happened to Talon all those years ago. Jonah's love interest is Talon's psychotherapist Melanie Carmichael. And she also struggles with crushing guilt because of a patient she lost. When Jonah realizes he must do something to help him through the guilt he goes to Melanie but they both quickly realize they want to me more than Dr. and patient. Things heat up quickly from there but they both struggle with whether they want to pursue the relationship or not. And while this is going on more pieces to the puzzle of who kidnapped and tortured Talon start coming to light. This book is fast paced and the new revelations will leave you reeling and wanting desperately to know what the truth is. I love Melanie and Jonah. I could relate to them on so many levels. Jonah feels a deep responsibility to his siblings, and as the oldest child myself I know exactly where he is coming from. And Melanie, oh my goodness she is a successful and professional doctor, but she struggles with the type of insecurities I think a lot of women have. Both of these characters have a realness about them, even though they are living through some extraordinary circumstances they still have the same thoughts, feelings, and insecurities we all feel. I also enjoyed the humor laced throughout, it gave balance to the serious and angst filled tone of the story.And let's take a moment to talk about the love scenes. I swear Helen Hardt writes the best love scenes I have ever read. I feel like I have to stand in front of the fan while reading them. Jonah is now my new favorite hero, his words will literally MELT you! This series has been one of the most enjoyable I have read in a long time. To say I'm desperate for the next book is an understatement. Well done Ms. Hardt, well done!"}, {"userName": "Elle \u2726 Pretty Little Books \u2726", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44344367-elle-pretty-little-books", "userReview": "Release Date:  December 20, 2016 Series:  Steel Brothers #4 Genre:  Contemporary Romance + SuspenseFor those who are new to the series, I recommend reading these books in order as they follow the same plotline. The first book \u2013 which must be read first \u2013 is Craving. Then you will move along to Obsession, Possession, and then this one Melt. There are two more books being released after this one and I absolutely cannot wait!!!! The first three books in the series follow Talon and Jade. Talon has suffered from horrific childhood abuse and captivity in the hands of 3 unknown men and has been reluctant to start any type of relationship with anyone. Even getting close to his family has been difficult as he holds inner resentment. Jade is the woman who seemingly set Talon free from the wounds, although they are still stuck in his heart because these men who have damaged him are still free. The fourth book of this series (which is this one) is in Talon\u2019s brothers POV \u2013 his name is Jonah -- . Some may think that you can read this one without the others but I am telling you this would be a mistake as the suspense and mystery of what happened to Talon 25 years ago, is still being uncovered in this one. So, make sure to read them in order otherwise it would be a waste of time and money. With that being said, I truly loved this book (along with the whole series which has easily become one of my favorites of 2016). To sum them all up in a few words I would say they are dark, gritty, suspenseful, and captivating. Each and everyone one of them come highly recommended from me, but you should be warned now that they all end in cliffhangers! Luckily, 4 of the books thus far have been released so you won\u2019t have to wait to read them. Now, while this book does follow a different couple, you still will get your taste of Talon as he does appear quite a bit in this book. He is after all, Jonah\u2019s brother. There is also a bit of a forbidden romance mixed in as Jonah and Dr. Carmichael (Talon\u2019s and Jonah\u2019s therapist) get together. This of course, is not without it\u2019s own set of drama because Jonah still feels guilt for his brothers abduction and Dr. Carmichael has her own demons to face\u2026 Overall, this is the perfect book! It blends suspense, mystery, and romance perfectly! Even more, it depicts real life problems (even if they are horrific) allowing readers a glimpse into how imperfect this world truly is. Helen Hardt does a wonderful job with all of this because readers can empathize and connect with the characters on a very deep and emotional level. This is normally a hard feat, but Helen Hardt has done it with grace. So, should you read this book (pending that you have read all the previous books first)? YES!!!!! They are all gripping from start to finish and I expect many readers will devour them as I have. Grab your copy!!! ARC Provided in exchange for an honest review. Thank you!!!!"}, {"userName": "Melanie A.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52957386-melanie-a", "userReview": "This series is DEFINITELY my biggest guilty pleasure! It's pure old-school romance: salacious and cheesy to the extreme, but I love it!Unfortunately, this installment wasn't my favorite. The story shifts away from Talon to focus on his brother, Jonah, but the author doesn't give us much to love about him or his love interest, Melanie. They're both drowning in guilt and low self-esteem.\n\nShe was a mess, and I was a mess. The two of us together were a nightmare.\n\n Neither thinks they are good enough for the other, which got a bit old by the end of the book.On the plus side, they had great chemistry together. I kind of loved their old-fashioned, slightly misogynistic dirty talk. And the mystery of Talon's kidnapping is further unraveled...though not nearly with as much finesse as in the previous books. Still, I'm eager to learn the truth so I'll definitely be indulging in book 5 in the near future!"}, {"userName": "Siv30", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2017", "userURL":

After the completely captivating experience of the first 3 Steel Brothers books, my expectations were through the roof for Book 4. With this newest installment of the series, Ms. Hardt delivered a read SO worth the anticipation.Get ready to step on the gas and GO pretty much from page 1 of this newest \"section\" of the story. It's Book 4 of the series, but is the first installment of the world focusing on Jonah (\"Joe\") Steel and the woman who has captivated him from the first section of the series: psychotherapist Melanie Carmichael. Mel is absolutely the perfect woman to pair with Joe. She's smart but humble, independent yet deeply craving a connection to a man who will love her with unbridled passion. Best of all, she understands the demons of guilt that haunt Jonah--because of her own closet filled with the same kinds of ghosts.This is the nucleus of where Ms. Hardt shines the brightest: exploring the way love not only connects and heals, but through that process, becomes transformative. It literally changes the person one can be--for the better. Nobody said the process was easy, though--and here's the next arena in which this writer shines, and has earned a solid place at the top of my MUST-READ list. I love my conflicts messy, lusty, and filled with lots of twists, turns, and tears along the way--and I know that a Helen Hardt read will always give me all of this and more. But damn, that ENDING! When, when, wheeeennnn do we get Book 5???A beautiful blend of established back story, new conflicts, and above everything, the beauty and connection of a new love story, MELT accomplished exactly that--and more--for me.

The narration for this book wasn't my favorite. I enjoyed their work for the most part but his female voice is not great and she makes Melanie come across a little flaky with her almost child like voice.

I love that, Love, love, love Meredith's writing style ... so I was super excited to see any book she would recommend ... now I have never read anything Helen like I said ... so I was pushed in to a series that I knew nothing about. I know some authors really make it a point to have books that are in a series but can be read as standalones ...not sure I would call this a standalone??! I love the interaction between Dr. Melanie Carmichael and Jonah Steel, the immediate steam, hotness, panties melting, is it warm in here kind of moments?? ...another freaking amazing sexy family of men ... i think there is 1 girl??! The Steel Family apparently needs much help or to talk out some troubles, which we all have our demons and things to do deal with, but these folks seem to have more than most, I did read it but as I said I felt something was missing or that I didn't have the whole story and when the story got really dark and deep.... deeply rooted, side of your seat moment, I am thinking to myself there is no way she will be able to finish this important section, so don't do it??! Please no. darn. sad face. ... Helen ripped it out from under me??! This is what I would call a cliffhanger read ... not that I don't enjoy those kind of reads, because I read them constantly, but I prefer them when I am more rooted in the story, or I know more, I know the characters and what has been going on, you are understanding their life, where they have come from, the mysteries, the ends and outs, and all kind of jazz ...but I am kind of mixed feelings ... I wish that Helen could some how bring you into this book a bit more easily ... I enjoy the thought of being a series but a standalone as well ... so maybe a quick recap of the past books or something to pull ya in slowly to a more clear understanding if you are NEW to this series and whatnot. To me there is something behind Jonah aggression ... and it needs to be addressed... not saying that it is not an interesting read but ... just that this read the book and give me more thoughts or pause as to where it will head next??! I love Talon ... I think he was one of my favorite characters or one I must connected with most. Jonah .. I've never been the oldest kid ... so I have never had that kind of responsibilities ... but I know that is probably a great deal of stress and pressure. I will say that Helen has a great writing style and I enjoyed this read ... will I check out more from this series?? hesitate 'cause I don't want another read like this ... being so ahead in the series ... if I had started at that the beginning of the series maybe I would be more drawn to it??! I think I will try another series or book from her. Just finish the book in my mind and let it be. Personally I think this is series that needs to be read in order ... just my humble opinion though. Please take that how you wish and will ... I see she has the Temptation Saga and a Cougar Chronicles ...love a woman being in control ... maybe I will dive in that one??!

Jonah, Talon's oldest brother is still suffering from profound guilt and sense of responsibility about his brother's abduction and rape as a child. Even though Talon is healing at a rapid rate and completely in love with Jade, Jonah seems to struggle deeper. Enter Dr Melanie Carmichael - Talon's therapist that helped him in the last two books. Jonah goes to see her for help with his feelings but the two are wildly attracted to each other and that's a major obstacle in any patient/doctor roles. Add to that that Melanie has her own crisis that she feels guilt and responsibility for and the ongoing mystery of who the three abductors were and what secrets have been buried and you have a romance/mystery/suspense.I was actually happy to get off Jade and Talon. I don't quite know this Jonah well enough yet and I'm kind of miffed that the author wrote so many books to string this out but I'll keep on reading because at this point I think I deserve some answers!

Jonah is struggling with failing to protect his brother as result he travels in the wrong areas and allows men to beat him up. It is getting to the point that these escapes are becoming more and more deadly. Jonah needs help. He goes to Dr. Carmichael because she was so helpful to Talon. Dr. Melanie Carmichael isn't a good solution to Jonah however, because they are too attracted to each other. Continuing in therapy will not be professional. Melanie has her own problems fighting a malpractice suit. What I like about the way this series is developing is the fact that each brother has three books to tell the love story but the connecting mystery is woven through the entire series.

Why did I even think that this book would be given to us in a nice neat story with a bow on top?!?!?! Instead, my heart was gutted yet again for the Steel family and I was left wanting more with that cliffhanger. UGH!!! And despite all that, you are one of my favorite authors of 2016!Alright, so let's get down to it... First, you CANNOT read Melt without reading the first three books in the Steel Brothers Saga. Melt basically picks up where Possession picks up, although we now get Jonah Steels POV. I was not sure how that would work since we were all so taken by Talon Steel's story in Craving, Obsession & Possession (books 1,2 & 3). But it completely worked!One of the things that I liked the most was getting to know Dr. Melanie Carmichael. If you recall, Dr. Carmichael is Talon Steel's therapist. I was surprised by the depth of her back story! There is so much more to her than meets the eye.... And just as I felt like I was starting to get to know her and her story, I was left hanging.... UGH!!! Now I need Burn!And for as much as I am saying UGH right now, isn't that the sign of a good writer? I am telling you, the Steel families story will break your heart and Helen Hardt will put it back together again with the people that come into their lives.I feel like this review is short and sweet, but I feel like if I tell you what is in this book, I will give it all away. I do not want to do that to you all. Just know that this is a series that you definitely need in your life!Thank you Helen for allowing me to read Melt prior to its release.

I would recommend reading the books in order; Craving, Obsession, Possession and then Melt. The first three books in the series follow Jade and Talon, while Melt starts the relationship between Jonah, the oldest brother, and Melanie who is a Jonah and Talon's Therapist. The Steel brothers continue to look for clues about Talon's tortured past and why their parents made the decisions they did at that time. I love that although we are focused on a new brother and his love interest, all of the characters in the first three books are still very much a part of this story. The continuation in Melt from the first three books is captivating and steamy at the same time. You feel the pain and suspense of the characters. Being that Joe is the oldest of the Steel brothers, he always felt he was responsible for his brothers and failed Talon when they were younger. Joe struggles with that everyday and works to get past that guilt. Dr. Carmichael is struggling with her own demons and the two feel a connection because of it. Can they be what each other needs? The cliffhangers keep you coming back for more. This series is worth the investment.

This book features Jonah Steel, the oldest of the Steel brothers, and Dr. Melanie Carmichael, who is Talon's therapist. Both Jonah and Melanie suffer from guilt, each has their own issues, and both are being consumed by this overwhelming guilt. Jonah feels responsible for Talon's kidnapping and Melanie had a client who died, and she feels responsible for her death. They are kindred spirits who also are physically attracted to each other, and both feel that they are not worthy to be with the other. They do come together in a very satisfying erotic way, however neither can trust their true feelings. I love the way Helen writes and brings these two right off the pages with all their angst and guilt. Jade and Talon are only briefly mentioned, however it is very good to hear from them. Some of the questions from the previous books are answered, however MORE questions are asked, and the MOTHER of all Cliffhangers ends this book. So looking forward to Burn and then finally Surrender.
