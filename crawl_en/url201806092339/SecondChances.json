It is everything that is not said, that is kept a secret, that wears away at a marriage: easily summed up, not so easily portrayed in a novel. It is this portrayal of a silent, strained marriage, as it follows husband and wife through normal personal struggles (James, working too hard; Pamela, feeling ignored) that creates such a subtle, heartbreaking beauty here. But what begins as a sparse and realistic plotline quickly opens up to a mysterious journey when Pamela leaves a \"Dear James\" letter and sets off with their children to reconcile her past. What's beautiful about this novel is that as the plot opens up and takes its twists and turns, the relationship between husband and wife remains the strength of the prose. These two people are so confused, so in love, and have so much to contend with. They need to talk! And each time they do, they seem to say everything but what they need to say. I kept thinking the world seemed against them, but all they really needed was to confide in each other, to share. Notice how I'm speaking of these characters as though I know them? This is Savva's magic."}, {"userName": "Laura Schultz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4608266-laura-schultz", "userReview": "The novel Second Chances by Maria Savva is a journey across continents, that gives the reader a birds-eye view into the consequences within relationships of keeping secrets and the continuation of dysfunctional communication patterns. It is not uncommon for partners within marriages to withhold the truth with a catastrophic outcome for both people. The spouses in Second Chances are the epitome of this dynamic and luckily for them after much agony, are able to piece together the jigsaw of their mistakes before it\u2019s too late.The two main characters James and Pamela are locked into the pattern of resentment that builds when both husband and wife get used to their lack of tolerance and empathy for what the other goes through in daily life. James is locked into a pattern of workaholism, believing it is the role as a husband to provide for his family without question. However in the process of his daily grind, he ignores the needs of his wife and children without those tender moments and nurturing they have been missing for a long while. In contrast, Pamela is caring for the needs of both her husband and children as the resentment within her builds to a crescendo and she has had enough of being ignored by James. After another argument about the failings in the marriage and reaching her last straw, Pamela reaches the conclusion that the marriage is over and runs away with the children\u2014leaving only a note in her wake.But this is only a small portion of the plot in Second Chances and only the first in a string of secrets that are carefully unveiled in this alluring novel. From start to finish the reader is engrossed in the next chapter of secrets and missteps. At each turn and each sequence in the plot, the lack of communication and honest conversation leads to another misunderstanding. Throughout the latter part of the book, the reader could become frustrated with the characters as they continue to miss each other both verbally and physically. The main reason is not so much in the writing but sheer frustration with the two partners. For people who deeply love each other it seems that they cannot resolve who is where and for what purpose\u2014as they continue to be unable to talk freely without game playing.There is another darker secret that exists from Pamela\u2019s past-- a web of deceit from years ago that involves many keepers of the secret who have remained mum for what appears to be eons. The resolution of this book is an interesting one that is quite unexpected and holds the interest of the reader. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who appreciates the positives as well as the failings and frailties of relationships."}, {"userName": "Darcia Helle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2439410-darcia-helle", "userReview": "With Second Chances, Maria Savva shows us how the love that drew two people together can so easily fade into the background when the daily struggles take over. James is a lawyer, working long hours for a demanding firm. Pamela is a stay-at-home mother of two young children, longing for her husband\u2019s attention. Somewhere beneath the stress, the arguments and the resentment, they still love one another. But by the time they figure that out, their love might be too damaged to repair.Savva does a masterful job portraying these characters. We don\u2019t watch the story unfold. We live it along with each of them. Their emotions become ours. This is the gift Savva gives to us. We experience each point of view, we understand it, we feel it and, consequently, we are unable to take sides in this struggle. We can only hold our breath and wish for the best."}, {"userName": "Julie Powell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1054964-julie-powell", "userReview": "Maria Savva is a great storyteller and Second Chances is no exception. I particularly liked the way both male and female points of view were portrayed, so that the reader could understand both sides of the story.Second Chances has an easy to read style and successfully delves into the ups and downs of relationships where most, if not all, of us can certainly relate. Not to give away any spoilers, I thought it clever how it was sprinkled with surprises \u2013 a few twists and turns, so that we\u2019re not quite sure where things will lead...always a good idea.Altogether, a worthwhile read. I would recommend it.Julie Elizabeth Powell, author of Gone, Slings & Arrows, Knowing Jack, The Star Realm and Invasion"}, {"userName": "Stuart", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1216574-stuart", "userReview": "Already a fan of Maria Savva's previous work, I expected to be entertained by her true to life storytelling---Second Chances didn't let me down. Clearly, a novel for today, the story (set in London) opens highlighting the pressures that creating a manageable work/life balance has on young couples nowadays. This tale has many layers, as the author takes us on an emotion charged journey, centring on estranged couple, James and Pamela. Pamela leaves James, and with their children, heads off to Australia. Desperate to save their marriage, James follows and soon uncovers secrets, lies and betrayal. I am confident that like me, you will find yourself immersed in `Second Chances' as this could happen to anyone, you, a friend or a colleague. I highly recommend this wondrous novel to readers everywhere."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1218394-maria", "userReview": "My third novel.I love it of course, I hope you will too :)"}, {"userName": "Lisette Brodey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1879031-lisette-brodey", "userReview": "Second Chances is a novel that mirrors so many people\u2019s lives. James and Pamela have been married for several years with two children. As an attorney at a law firm run by partners who are brutal and unsympathetic toward their staff, James is put in a tough position to spend too much time away from his family. He knows that his wife Pamela hates his demanding work schedule and after-work obligations, but financial times are tough and new jobs are difficult to come by. And so, despite arguments about the situation, James goes on, doing what he believes is in the best interest of his family.One day, after another argument about the troubles that plague them, James is shocked to find a note from his wife saying that she has left and taken the kids. But Pamela hasn\u2019t just run away from James, she has gone to confront something in her past that she has ignored for far too long.Author Maria Savva taps into common situations that so many couples find themselves in, especially in these hard times. Savva does a great job of painting the unreasonable, demanding men that James works for at the firm of Hornchurch, Bean & Co. There were several times that I wanted to jump into the novel and have several not-so-nice exchanges with these brutes.While I appreciated the story, I felt that too much time was spent on Pamela and James second-guessing each other and being upset over what they thought the other was thinking or doing. There were times when their respective insecurities, especially Pamela\u2019s, were overwhelming to me, and even though I would argue that this reflects true life, I would have liked to see the couple spend more time trying to communicate better. But all in all, I am a fan of character-driven novels and quite enjoyed this book and its realistic premise. I also appreciated the author's humor and laughed aloud at a few of the situations in the story. I look forward to reading more from Maria Savva in the future."}, {"userName": "Jenny Hilborne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4121068-jenny-hilborne", "userReview": "Second Chances is a modern day novel set in London.James is a thirty-something father with a successful career in a law firm, a supportive wife, and a nice house. He has the life many people dream of. Then everything changes when his wife leaves him and takes the couple's two children. So caught up his own life, James did not see it coming.While Second Chances is a fictional look at what might happen to anyone if they neglect to appreciate what they have while they have it, it is an accurate portrayal of the real life difficulties and stresses placed on working individuals struggling to balance it all. If James wants his family back, he will have to accept his failures, make sacrifices and significant changes to his life. Can he convince Pamela he still loves her? After years of neglect, will she even want to listen? First, he has to follow her all the way to Australia. Once he gets there, he must deal with the secrets he discovers.What James does not know is that Pamela has not just left because she is unhappy with the marriage. Something in her past has haunted her for too long, something she feels she must now face.With James and Pamela, the author depicts how cracks in a marriage appear and widen to where couples together for so long may not really know each other that well at all. Each misunderstands the other, and acts upon those misunderstandings, showing their insecurities and vulnerabilities. Doing what each believes is right may have made things much worse. This is what happens when couples don't talk, and the author taps into this brilliantly. This human failing makes her characters deeper and more believable.Second Chances is a well-written and realistic account of one family's struggle to survive, overcome their odds, and stay together."}, {"userName": "Jerry Travis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2317195-jerry-travis", "userReview": "Second Chances is a story about the strength of love and its weaknesses, all the things that can undermine and destroy it, such as: economic pressures, entitlement, dishonesty, misunderstanding, deception, selfishness, needs (physical, mental and spiritual) not being fulfilled, and so on. It\u2019s especially timely for this severe economic downturn we all find ourselves in today. With so many physical demands on us from the outside, the needs of family life can easily suffer.The story starts with a runaway wife, taking her children with her from England to Australia, half way around the world. Is there any hope for this marriage? Can anything possibly save it? And if so, what will it take? Maria Savva answers these questions in a back and forth, almost life and death epic struggle throughout the entire novel. At first, the husband wants reconciliation and tracks her down. However, in doing so he uncovers a deep and dark secret his wife has been keeping from him. He\u2019s humiliated and begins to wonder if he wants her back at all. And what about the children? He loves them dearly. Maybe he can get them back without the wife?As in all her books, Savva\u2019s true to life fiction provides us with a wealth of psychologically sound human behavior, which we can all draw upon in our daily lives. She is a solicitor working in London and her background in family law certainly shines through in this story. Nevertheless, it\u2019s an entertaining and non-technical read, full of a wide range of curious human interactions, which her work is becoming noted for."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1471987-rj", "userReview": "Second Chances gives us a tremendous insight into the problems that can be caused by unrealistic expectations. On the surface, James and Pamela appear to be living the dream. James is a well-paid lawyer on track to make partner. Pamela is raising their two children in a beautiful home in an upscale neighborhood. But as we get to know these people we learn that their expectations have rendered each both victim and perpetrator of potentially relationship-ending harm.Author Maria Savva does a wonderful job of presenting these elements in a very plausible manner. She doesn't need chase scenes, guns, or corpses to communicate the dangers that can kill a relationship. What she does very effectively is balance the presentation of James and Pamela's points of view. We understand their separate perspectives, we feel their pain, we relate to their stress and accompanying irrational behaviors. I recommend this book to anyone who has at least one relationship scar."}, {"userName": "Georgiann Hennelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1946881-georgiann-hennelly", "userReview": "James and Pamela a married couple with twwo young children, James is a Lawyer married to his job.Pamela feels neglected.

She skillfully molds a fine tale of miscommunication, foibles, and conflict. Second Chances is very believable and entertaining at the same time. The exchanges between characters are deceptive, based on different motives, forming a tangled web. James and Pamela face the challenges of marriage. James is a lawyer at a London law firm, where his superiors ruthlessly manipulate him and his co-workers. Building his career, he wants to provide financially for his family, but he works long hours and doesn't have time to spend with his wife and two small children. Suddenly, Pamela leaves London, taking the children, changing everything. Savva's experience as a family lawyer, and her observations and understanding of the human experience, give her writing an edge. She is able to write nuances of thought, deed and word with sensitivity, making me empathetic toward her characters. A truly enjoyable, well-written book."}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1909602-sheri", "userReview": "Second Chances (Maria Savva)This story is about James and Pamela.
