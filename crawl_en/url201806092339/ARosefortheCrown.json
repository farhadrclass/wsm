As I see it there are only so many ways a writer can present the facts and I love to see the facts branch off to other areas and have the authors imagination tell me a tale that who know could have happened..why not! There are plenty of great HF out there that offer the facts and I love those books too but when I open a book like this I go in with my mind open and already knowing that I will find he writers imagination at work and that way I am never disappointed. No, this wasn't a literary masterpiece and that is just fine not everything is War and Peace! SO if you want a 600 page historical love story I think this fits the bill. And the fact that this was AES first novel, I have read much worse! So I think she has great promise and can and will get better with time.

Phillippa Gregory did this brilliantly with the OTHER BOLEYN GIRL, the Anne Boleyn story told from the point of view of her sister Mary. In her debut novel A ROSE FOR THE CROWN, Anne Easter Smith has told the Richard III story from the point of view of his sweetheart Kate Haute, who was also the mother of his illegitimate children.Ms. Smith does a wonderful job of drawing the reader in by portraying her humble heroine as an outspoken and lively girl who tries the patience of her parents, and has no idea how lovely she is. We follow Kate Bywood from her humble home in Kent, to her adoption by the Hautes of Igtham Mote, through two unhappy marriages, to her meeting with the teenaged Richard, Duke of Gloucester (who later becomes King Richard III), to the three children she bore him, to the end of their affair when he married Anne Neville in 1472. The best recommendation I can make for this book is that it is hard to put down. Ms. Smith has done meticulous research, but by focusing on humble folk, has worn her learning lightly. I also want to commend Joanna Maslowska Maher, who did the cover design for Simon & Schuster/Touchstone. It is one of the most beautiful covers I\u2019ve seen, and sets the stage for the treat that is within."}, {"userName": "Alaine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1051989-alaine", "userReview": "I love an author who takes a fictional character and tells us all about the history of the time. One of my favourite books is the Queen's Fool by Philippa Gregory because I loved the fictional character of Hannah. This book was as good as that and I loved the character of Kate.Kate leaves her family home at a tender age to live with her cousin as a companion. There she learns a lot about herbs and healing and becomes best friends with her cousin. Kate is married off to an older man that fortunately doesn't live to long and then she marry's for love, or does she? But the man that she would give her heart to completely and no other is Richard, Duke of Gloucester. Over time she would give him three children, two of them sons.This is novel takes us to the end of the Yorkist period and into the Tudor raine. It is an excellent account of history blended perfectly with fiction. I loved the way Richard of York, the final York King was portrayed as a compassionate and noble man. I highly recommend this wonderful historical novel!"}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/382473-jess", "userReview": "I wanted to like this book. I really did. I've always loved Richard the third and felt he got a raw deal from history. But here's the thing... The book meanders. Not just for pages, but for hundreds of them. You know, I'm starting to realize that this is a real theme with a decent amount of the historical fiction out there. They're not well plotted at all. The authors just follow the course of history, throw in a few love scenes, and call it a day. That's cool, and all, but the books end up lacking structure and urgency. It just takes me back to that day in 9th grade English where my teacher taught us all about things like climaxes and acts to a story. Cause, well, I know that both life and history don't always act that way...but you know what? Your novel should. Otherwise, there's no reason for me to keep turning the pages."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/380097-nicole", "userReview": "In this debut novel, the author weaves a remarkable tale about the unknown mistress of King Richard III, who becomes the mother of his children.

It's very easy to read, not too many vocabulary words to look up, in fact I only have six written down and the book is over 600 pages.Unfortunately, I thought the first 370 pages were pretty dull. Eventually the story does pick up and I did appreciate learning about Richard III and the turbulent politics of the times. There are some seriously forced situations that made me roll my eyes and the real story is the love story between Richard of Gloucester and Kate Haute so it is a bit I hate to say it...chick lit.I thought that Smith had a difficult time transitioning from one scene to another. I would have liked more details on setting so that I could picture the situation more realistically. Often times I was wondering where we were. I thought she needed to develop the characters better, they all seem rather flat except maybe John Howard. I also thought that she could have done a better job using the character's names and titles more consistently. Thank goodness for that family tree in the front or I would have been baffled for another hundred pages or so that George and Clarence were the same person. And I don't think that Anne Easter Smith does a very good job describing whose who in general, there are a lot of people mentioned and it became difficult for me to keep track of them. I need more that just a name mentioned once to remember someone. Someone better acquainted with this period in time would likely have done a better job than I did of keeping everyone straight.I'm glad to be done, it was rather long as I said before, though only took six days to read, again it was an easy read. It did spark my curiosity to read more about Richard III and the princes in the tower. And I was moved by Kate Haute's choices for her children. Overall it wasn't a very satisfying read, I felt like the author bit off more than she could chew with this complex period in time."}, {"userName": "Brittany B.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4862342-brittany-b", "userReview": "3.5 stars I can't get this story out if my head. I don't want to write an essay on it, so read this for yourself and you decide. I've changed my rating of this book 3 times. An interesting and heart-breaking story. Very well done, considering I don't particularly like Richard III. But this is FICTION. It's not argumentative writing meant to prove Richard's character. It's an emotional story that only works if the reader suspends some disbelief. In fact, I was angry and emotional during the last 25% of the book. I didn't think the author properly addressed the bad things that Richard did. I made a list of what she glossed over, to get ready for the review. But when I got to the end of the book, I realized that my list didn't matter! My heart was absolutely wrenching with the pain; the complete tragedy that was just a small part of the War of the Roses! And this is fiction!! I sobbed like a baby. I realized that Richard is no better or worse than Henry VIII. The common adage that history is written by the victors is never more evident than in the rise of the Tudors and the end to the War of the Roses. This book certainly doesn't prove Richard's innocence, but it does demonstrate that there is always grey in a story that seems black and white."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/955698-cindy", "userReview": "Had high expectations, but prose clumsy, plot forced, and characters stiff and unconvincing.

THIS BOOK. THIS FREAKING BOOK!Anne Easter Smith, please accept my undying devotion to your authorhood. I commit to read and love all the books that you have placed in this world and shall forever be committed to praising your holy writing with reviews. I hearby swear my love for your words. Amen. OMG. I cannot get over how amazing this book is. After the awful YA I've been reading lately, this beauty was an amazing breath of fresh air. It is so magically majestic in every way. From the characters, to the pace, to the historical research, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Smith. She should be every author's fantasy when it comes to storytelling. I write this review is reverent silence because I am literally awestruck by this book. While I don't always use gifs in reviews, I do tend to use them to lighten up a post because they make them more interesting. I cannot use a gif in this one. It would distract and demean and takeaway the pure perfection of this story. Because the main character in this book is my sister, my soulmate, and my sweet best friend. Kate, my lovely, modest, smart beautiful Kate. You are in my heart forever. Anne Easter Smith created such a perfectly simply yet complex character in Kate it breaks my heart knowing that I won't see her again tonight when I open my book. She's so lovingly rendered and so fully complete it's hard for me to accept she's fictional and not in the next room spinning some wool. I fell in love with Kate the instant I met her. And being able to follow her on her life's journey that Smith created was the most heartwrenching, achingly beautiful, soul-fullfilling, delicious mind feast I've had in a long, long time. I still smile slightly when thinking about Kate meeting Richard, giggle a little when thinking about their blissfulness, cringe when I think about all the awful things she faced. Anne Easter Smith has created a fictional character that has wormed her way into my book-loving heart and I welcome her with open arms.

Of course I know the history and how many regard him as a villain. Some call him a Wife poisoner and others of course accuse him of being a usurper and a killer of his nephews. Historically none of that can be proven of course and you always have to take some things with a grain of salt (Anne Boleyn being a witch anyone?), still I wanted to see what Anne Easter Smiths take on Richard III would be. I would not be disappointed.Kate Bywood is a fiery young lady who by all accounts is a nobody to the royal houses of England. However thanks to some turns in life that put her in favorable places she as a young girl and throughout her younger days meets Richard Plantagenet. The more the young pair meet one another the more they are attracted on many levels to each other. You can not help but be drawn into their love story as it unfolds. A love that while is passionate and all consuming both know can never be more than what it is. Richard could have as a royal Duke kept Kate in the kind of comfort that many royal Mistresses throughout time (and at that time) were kept in, especially after she bore him both a Daughter and a Son. However Kate valued the privacy more and her values as to not be known publicly as a Mistress. Something in the end that Richard deeply admires.The story is heart warming and heart breaking all in the same as we follow the couple through life. In the end we all know what happens historically, Richard III was slain and Henry Tudor took the crown. The bastard Son John of Gloucester would also later be killed as a traitor. The book does not end on a bad note however with a new start being laid out for you the reader to go away with some good feelings. Overall this was another beautifully written book and while of course fiction, I dare anyone not to look upon Richard III with a kinder eye once they have read it."}, {"userName": "Chelsie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/973106-chelsie", "userReview": "This is one of my favorite books.

That, my friends, is true commitment and discipline; Characteristics that many of us rarely hone and are often the bane of an aspiring authors existence. An infamous (though fictional) example is Brian from Family Guy who constantly preaches about the various novels, screenplays and college degrees he intends to do while lacking the motivation and iron will to achieve it. A.E.S deserves respect and admiration for doing the exact opposite of Brian. Now onto the review. WHICH WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS! ACHTUNG! ACHTUNG!A Rose for the Crown concerns the life of the (sole) mistress of Richard III Katherine (Kate) Haute nee Bywood, a beautiful, kind, feisty and free-spirited peasant girl from Kent. And, yes, based on those previous adjectives she is, alas, a regrettable Mary-Sue in MANY aspects (from the red-hair, the fact that all men she meets inevitably love her and that she constantly admired for her good looks and inability to do wrong). The novel follows Kate throughout her childhood, her fostering in Ightham Manor, her unhappy marriages, her love affair with Richard, Duke of Gloucester and future King of England, the birth of her illegitimate offspring and her views and opinions on the politics that plague England during this turbulent period. IMHO this is historical romance rather historical fiction. The emphasis is on Kate's personal life, her love and devotion towards Richard, their offspring and her fierce loyalty towards Richard's reputation and honourable attributes. So for those looking for savvy political intrigue, duplicitous characters, ambiguous morality, constant threats, simmering tension and suspense, darkly twisted plots and counter plots I'd probably say that this isn't the book for you. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy ARftC for what it was; an easy-going, light hearted romantic escapade during the Wars of the Roses albeit with disappointing flaws. It is very sweet and endearing in its own way, the romance being the highlight of the entire novel and everything else being shunted aside to the stories detriment. ARftC is an mildly engaging novel with a strong historical setting, relatable if very idealised characters, an enjoyable but sometimes saccharine romance, light politics and a sort of bittersweet ending. IMHO this is a book that not everyone will warm up to in fairness. ARftC took eight years to write and, although this amounts to a staggering amount of research, writing and editing, it still feels like a draft in some aspects. The novel is written competently and with evident enthusiasm; the setting is beautifully evoked and the historical details are strewn carefully throughout the story, never overwhelming the reader. The shortfalls of ARftC are its characters, the romance between Kate and Richard, the bias towards anyone on the Lancastrian side and the heavy reliance on telling and not showing. However as this is a debut novel I still feel that A.E.S did an excellent job but that her execution could have been sharper and more refined. The characters of ARftC are neatly divided into either good or evil; there are very few shades of grey to be found in this novel. Kate was the embodiment of goodness; everyone she meet (besides the caricatures of evil Elinor and George Haute) loves her coyness and delightful tendency to speak whatever is on her mind. She is universally admired and adored; constantly and consistently praised for her boldness and vivacity. The relentless sanctification of Kate makes it difficult at times to take her seriously as a flawed character. However, she has her fair share of hardships and woes which she does her best to triumph over even while whining a great deal. The care and devotion she shows to her children and Richard is the epicentre of her life; the pain and suffering they undergo causes her great distress and her attempts to remedy their trials does much to gain the readers sympathy at certain times. Sadly, her relentless sanctification and adoration from all and lack of any real character flaws mark her out as a Mary-Sue and this makes it difficult to take Kate as a realistic and interesting character. She simply cannot excite the readers interest and enthusiasm as the MC should. I found it quite hard to tolerate her in fact; too cheerful by far! However, I felt the character of Richard to be very romanticised. I mean this man, at the age of seven, was forced into uncertain exile after the death of his father the Duke of York and his elder brother Edmund Earl of Rutland, bloodied himself at the battles of Barnet Heath and Tewkesbury before he was 19, rose to become the virtual Lord of the North and hammered the Scots trespasses into England. In ARftC this very much second hand detail, apart from some sword fighting and after battle bravado. This portrayal of Richard is very much to be viewed from the personal outlook. The focus lies on establishing his status as caring lover and devoted father not necessarily bad things. But to shove aside such vital aspects of Richards character his prowess as a battle commander and warrior does not do justice to this extraordinary man. He was a man of his era, able to be ruthless, pragmatic and cynical when needed and we do not see this nearly enough. Instead we get rather rapid professions of love, eternal fidelity, never ending musings on Kate's uniqueness and beauty which serves to show Richard as love struck and Harlequinish hero. Oh he had his moments of strength such as blithely announcing his detestation of his Woodville in-laws but these were few and far between in this sea of poignant forbidden love scenes. SPOILERS AHEAD!The characters of Elinor and George Haute were particularly problematic, almost caricatures in their evilness defined solely by their ill-will towards the angelic Kate. The fact that both are murdered and quickly forgotten is highly unsettling. Elinor despises Kate for her low birth and seeks to make her life unbearable at the manor. Elinors portrayal was childish and cartoonish; based solely her envy of the beautiful Kate and willingness to see her suffer. There was nothing subtle about it. George's character, however, caused me real discomfort. As the only gay character (besides his boyfriend Simon), he is needy, petulant, greedy, cowardly, sulky, abusive, sullen, resentful, weak and jealous. He alone is impervious to Kate's beauty and his \"unnatural\" behaviour is the focus for much grief and anger for Kate and his family. As being gay was not socially acceptable in the medieval period, I understand the need to reveal contemporary attitudes of ones of horror and revulsion. Its what people believed back then; it was wrong and unfair but that's how it was looked upon. What made me uneasy was the making of George as useless and pathetic in a fight or as a knight and his willingness to hit Kate. You cant call it a positive portrayal. In the entire novel there's only one positive scene with George and his siblings; the rest consist of him being pretty much a Class-A jerk to everyone around him which is quite understandable. Even when he is (laughably) killed, he is still disliked by his family before they discover that he's gay. His own mother professes never to have loved him and his brother and father reveal their antipathy towards him. It rather disheartening to see such a portrayal of the sole gay character in any novel. The lack of showing and the severe over reliance on telling really drained the novel of suspense and excitement. In fairness, Kate could never be everywhere all the time but the endless parade of letters that went back-and-forth, the ceaseless messengers and the people re telling past events for Kate's benefit doesn't make for an action packed novel. It became quite boring to constantly TOLD of fascinating game-changers but the never seeing of them slowed down the novels pace and it made it far too passive in the end. From the battles of Barnet, Tewkesbury, Bosworth, to the trial and execution of Hastings to the mystery of the Princes of the Tower everything is viewed second hand. All in all, I'll rate this novel 4.5/10Occasionally Well-written with rather perfect characters, accurate historical detail, a keen emphasis on fairy-tale romance (initially) and a lack of moral and political ambiguity A Rose for the Crown is recommended to those interested in historical romance. P.S Kate and Richard have three children Katherine, John and Dickon; the last of which is hidden away by Kate to protect Richards honour (????????). Needless to say, Richard, when alighted to Dickon's existence is delighted rather than, say, angered or bewildered. I found it incredibly funny that when Dickon's existence was revealed to Richard, than Katherine and finally to John they all died shortly afterward.

A smooth writing style, a solid basis in historical fact, a compelling storyline, realistic and sympathetic characters (plus a few dastardly villains, also historical), a long length (632 pp.) to really get lost in, and no confusion arising from too many characters, too much historical detail, or too much jumping around in time. The dialogue felt authentic to the period; that is, the characters don't speak like modern people in costume. Helpful extras were the genealogical chart of the Plantagenets, a list identifying all the characters and whether they are historical (most are) or fictional, a map, a glossary of unfamiliar terms, and a bibliography. Plus an author note and interview, and discussion questions, if needed.King Richard III has carried an unsavory reputation down through the centuries largely because of Shakespeare's play about him. We must realize, the author points out, that Shakespeare was writing to please Queen Elizabeth I, who was the granddaughter of the man who took Richard's crown. Therefore, making Richard look bad was in the Bard's political interest. An unbiased look at Richard, according to many historians, shows a very different personality: loyal to friends and family, serious, without any physical deformities, and almost certainly NOT the murderer of his nephews, the young princes in the Tower. Kate, the heroine and Richard's lover, is a fictional invention of the real lover he had who bore him historically documented children.

I can't think of a good excuse, it's not the size because I love a good thick book. It's not the presentation because the cover is gorgeous. It's not because I've heard negative things about this book, on the contrary I have heard nothing but good things (and others she has written). So last week I decided enough already and purchased the audio from audible, loaded up my iPod and went for a walk. Then I walked some more, then I cleaned the house, took the dog for another walk (he thanks you Anne), folded laundry. I did whatever I could so to continue with this story. I was captivated right from the get go.Kate is only a young girl when introduced, she is spunky and lively but also mature for her age, though I must remind myself that girls grew up faster in the 1400's, there wasn't a lot of time to just be kids.This book comes in at 672 pages in an over-sized softcover, it is a romance but not done in a harlequin kind of way. It's historical and the author really knows her stuff and wove this story around actual events which made the story very plausible.As this author states in her notes, there isn't a lot of information about Kate Haute and this book fills in the gaps that not only humanized her but Richard III as well, it was nice to view him in this light for a change.Rosalyn Landor is the reader and she is one of my very favorites, her voice matches the time period perfectly and it always a pleasure to listen to."}, {"userName": "Mercedes Rochelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4548783-mercedes-rochelle", "userReview": "I read many times that Richard III had a mistress, so I was intrigued that someone was able to put together a whole novel on the subject. This was a very sweet love story, albeit not terribly satisfying for the heroine. Kate Haute, whose origins were quite ordinary, was a great beauty; she was a little reckless, a little saucy, a little clever, and married a handsome fellow that turned out to be terribly unsuitable. Luckily for her, husband George had a disgraceful secret that obliged him to unwillingly accept her liaison with the Duke of Gloucester and even let her claim that the children were his own. George's unexpected and convenient death opened the way for a closer relationship with Richard, though he put her aside when he married Anne of Warwick.Overall, I thought the novel was way too long, but the pace was good and the writing was so engaging that I stuck with it to the end. Nonetheless, we were a third of the way through the book before Richard really got involved, and frankly I didn't really care about all that background; that's not why I picked up the book. But once Kate's relationship with Richard kicked into gear, it was well thought out and flowed nicely. All too soon, Richard took a bride and Kate had to go back home again, though she was peripherally involved in his life until the end, so we were able to follow the history through her eyes.

A better description of this book would be a \"fictional romance set in historic England\". I gave up more than half way through because the hiSTORY was so lacking and the \"breathtaking passion\" so increasingly the focus of the novel. First of all, I know times were different and princes were raised to rule the world from a very young age, but I don't know a 14-year-old male in the world (and very few 35-year-olds for that matter) with the wisdom and maturity the author gives to the character here. Secondly, the story line was endlessly drawn out and became not much more than her waiting for him and while she waits, interact with a few notable people from history (no interesting interactions, just enough mundane references to be able to call this \"historical\"), passionate rendezvous, him waiting for her while off making British history (that is passingly acknowledged), passionate rendezvous, ad infinitum.

I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3882569-christine", "userReview": "I was completely blown away by this book. I picked it up on a whim at the book store and was immediately entranced by the characters and the dynamic setting. Though many of the characters take on roles that are typical of similar historical novels they never feel stereotypical, always taking on a full life a dimension from their first mention.From the very first page you feel for Kate, a spirited girl in a time when such passion often landed her in the wrong spot. Though the tale gives you insight into a typically inaccurately depicted character, Richard III, the true story always lies with Kate. There are many times where you want to cry with her, moments you love and laugh with her, and every moment you respect her continued spirit and passion. I would recommend this book to anyone. The historical time is rich, full and vibrant while not distracting you from the emotion and power of Kate and Richard's story."}, {"userName": "Tara Chevrestt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2544368-tara-chevrestt", "userReview": "I gave this two stars instead of one because I did enjoy the first two parts. It lost me in the third. When the heroine gave herself to Richard and agreed that it was ok to break her married vows, but when he marries into a woman of \"his station\" it would not be ok for him. I say, No Deal. I decided to give the woman the benefit of the doubt, as she had been a strong, rather independent for the times, and outspoken gall up until this point. However, she proceeds to give Richard three sons, the last of which she throws away as not to harm his marriage to Anne. I would also like to add, she allowed her gay husband to smack her around a bit. I am truly not impressed. I like to read about strong, admirable woman and I found this woman horribly weak. My only other compliant is the peasant speak was a bit much. \"I be here.. You be there.. I be sorry\" are examples. It makes it a difficult read at times."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016903-donna", "userReview": "I'm trying to read at least one Historical Fiction novel about each of England's Kings and Queens. This one was about Richard III. I think the author probably portrayed him in a better light than actual history does. I liked the characters in this book...but you know from the beginning that there is not going to be a happy ending. The author keeps you reading...and wondering what will happen. This novel covers about 30 years in the life of the main character Kate...seeing her through two husbands and her love affair with Richard III. It covers the history of the War of the Roses...and uses both real and fictional characters. I liked the book and would recommend it to those who like English history."}, {"userName": "Cheryl a.k.a Poptart", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990218-cheryl-a-k-a-poptart", "userReview": "I would have to say it has been quite awhile since I have wept this many times while reading a book. I found this book to be very personal and enriching. While I am not much of a historical fiction person, my interest has now been caught up in this time period. Anne Easter Smith is a masterful storyteller and you can really tell she poured her heart and soul into this novel. Many I the reviews I have read said she was in desperate need of some good editing but I say that if she were to cut anything from the book you would have lost that personal link to the characters. I give this author a definite A+!"}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/375767-joanna", "userReview": "Just under halfway through this sprawling historical fiction/romance I'm throwing in the towel. I really like the characters, the setting, and most of the writing, but I know it's about to get all bosom-heaving-tragedy and I just don't have it in me. I am not invested enough to want to put myself through it. Everybody's pretty happy at the moment, and I cheated (I never do this!) and read the last page, and with that I'm done."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1609227-rachel", "userReview": "I am a \"fan\" of Richard III. I believe he was maligned in history. This story follows the lead of Sharon Kay Penman and paints him as a man thrust into the position of King; a dutiful husband and loving and protective father and uncle. A man true to his heart and a victim of the gruesome medieval time period. I truly enjoyed exploring the relationship between \"Mistress\" Kate Haute and Richard Plantagenet. Meticulously researched and beautifully written."}, {"userName": "Elaine Cougler", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5793801-elaine-cougler", "userReview": "A Rose for the Crown by Anne Easter Smith turned out to be a lovely story as well as a document to reinstate Richard III's reputation. Shakespeare used poetic license to make Richard a hunchback and the murderer of his nephews. Smith's scholarship sets the record straight. The excellent story centers around Kate, the fictional mistress of Richard, and their love set against the turbulent history of the times. a very good read."}, {"userName": "D-lyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/735912-d-lyn", "userReview": "Oh my goodness does this story sweep you away. i couldn't put it down. the plot was very moving and interesting.

No, it was okay, but I've read other historic fiction that I fancied much more. I also learned that English men in the 1500s wore really wild outfits, like striped tights and padded colorful shirts and other such garb. Can you imagine? Would be such the sight to see to my 21st century eyes!"}], "description": "In A Rose for the Crown, we meet one of history's alleged villains through the eyes of a captivating new heroine -- the woman who was the mother of his illegitimate children, a woman who loved him for who he really was, no matter what the cost to herself.  As Kate Haute moves from her peasant roots to the luxurious palaces of England, her path is inextricably intertwined with that of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, later King Richard III. Although they could never marry, their young passion grows into a love that sustains them through war, personal tragedy, and the dangerous heights of political triumph.  Anne Easter Smith's impeccable research provides the backbone of an engrossing and vibrant debut from a major new historical novelist.", "title": "A Rose for the Crown", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21062.A_Rose_for_the_Crown", "average": 4.02, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420938126l/21062.jpg", "reviews": 254, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12352.Anne_Easter_Smith", "name": "Anne Easter Smith"}], "type": ["Historical", "Historical", "Fiction", "European Literature", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21062.A_Rose_for_the_Crown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2015307.Daughter_of_York", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8728017-queen-by-right", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4788697-the-king-s-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15803156-royal-mistress", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
