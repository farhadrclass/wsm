Ok, so maybe The Lost Recipe for Happiness can be summed up that way. But honestly, it\u2019s so much more than that.Elena Alvarez is a complicated character, but extremely likable. She\u2019s haunted by her past and cannot rid herself of her tragic accident. She\u2019s left not only with physical pain from the car accident, but immense survivor\u2019s guilt. She\u2019s the lone survivor of a car accident that killed her high school boyfriend and two sisters.After the accident and a long period of physical therapy and healing, she left her hometown and explored her passion for cooking. Training in the best restaurants prepared her to become chef of her kitchen. While mastering the art of cooking, Elena simultaneously distanced herself from intimate relationships. Yes, she had plenty of boyfriends, however she never allowed them in, always keeping them at arm\u2019s reach. Of course this changes when she meets Julian.Julian Liswood is a single father with several marriages under his belt. He\u2019s trying to raise his teenage daughter the best he can while maintaining his professional life. He\u2019s immediately smitten with Elena, but tries to keep their relationship purely professional. After all, he is her boss.Ms. O\u2019Neal did an excellent job bringing these characters to life. The chapters are told from both Elena\u2019s and Julian\u2019s perspectives. The secondary characters round out the story with issues of their own that only contribute to the depth of the plot.If you\u2019re looking for something different, I suggest you pick up The Lost Recipe for Happiness. Elena is a character that you will root for and in the end you will walk away satisfied.4.5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Briana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1969784-briana", "userReview": "I was really excited about this book - I liked the premise and the story about characters overcoming tragedy and choosing to take risks. I have also been reading some other non-fiction about food, so I enjoyed the fictional tie-in with all the recipes and narrative about creating new food in the restaurant. I was, however, put off by a few things. First of all, if an author is going to write a character who speaks Spanish, get an editor for the Spanish!! 75% of what Elena said was completely incorrect...not just \"funny\" as the narration suggests. Instead of \"Nice to meet you,\" she says \"I like myself\"; when another character asks her \"How are you?\" in Spanish, she responds with \"bueno\" instead of \"bien\" - a very common mistake for novice speakers, but one that also has different meanings in various countries, ranging from \"I am good-looking\" to sexual connotations. Secondly, I was very put off by the graphic love scenes (I just skipped them), but I was sorry that the book was tainted with sleeze whose purpose is solely pornographic."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2785390-nicole", "userReview": "I am giving this book 3 stars, instead of 4 for 2 different reasons. First, the author used the F word way too much and it was always in such a crude manner that it was disgusting every time it was used. The second reason is that most of the book was clean and told a good story...until it hit about halfway through the book when the author decided she all of a sudden needed to add disgustingly descriptive sex scenes. All I can say is thank goodness I was listening to the audio book so I could fast forward when it got a little uncomfortable. Other than those two issues I really enjoyed the story. I just wish the above mentioned issues weren't issues. I loved the recipes in the beginning of the chapters. I wonder how good they really are. I did feel bad at how tragic the lives were of the two main characters but reading about their lives and seeing them heal each other was my favorite. I loved the story. Elena is a wonderful chef but is working as a souse chef for a restaurant she helped build up. When a magazine article focuses more on her rather than the male head chef, the chef fires her. As she's walking home Julian, an actor/director/restaurant owner hires her to be the head chef at his new restaurant. Elena must create a menu, find staff and design the new restaurant alongside the owner, Julian. Elena must overcome her own tragic past to discover that it's okay to move on and be happy."}, {"userName": "Tattered Cover Book Store", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1009462-tattered-cover-book-store", "userReview": "This isn't \"Sex in the City\" chic lit--this one actually has some seriousness and some heft.

The Lost Recipe for Happiness by Barbara O'Neal was much different than what I expected! It wasn't light and fluffy but real and somewhat dark. So many characters with so many flaws, both physical and emotional, and I loved them all. My favorite of all: Ivan! I would love to sit next to him at a dinner party.

Yay for uncomfortable power dynamics!As if that wasn't depressing enough - I could not get past the physical descriptions. The hero was described as pale, spindly, big nosed, black-eyed (and wears black jeans and silk shirts - shudder)but is...hot? I had a weird image of Marilyn Manson that I could not shake. While the heroine is blonde, blue-eyed, petite with an impressive rack...and apparently ugly? The hero marvels over her flaws and how unattractive he finds her, musing (MULTIPLE TIMES) over her sallow skin, wrinkles, and bad hair.

What an amazing, poignant, sensual, wonderful book! From the minute I picked it up, I was hooked- the characters are fabulous and perfectly flawed, the plot is well-thought-out and engaging, and the book moves incredibly well. I had empathy for Elena right from the beginning, but she's anything but a poor woe-is-me character. I loved her sense of strength, loved that she was still vulnerable beneath it, loved her complexity and her rawness. Julian was a great hero- not overpowering, but definitely powerful (I'd call him a quiet hero- and boy did he suit Elena to a T!), and the chemistry between them was incredible. And don't get me started about Ivan, who was my favorite character in the book. Oh, my heart ached for him every time he was on the page, even when he was being a jerk!I won't give away any spoilers here, but the plot was multi-layered and kept me turning the pages well past bedtime to see what would happen. There were just enough teasers to make it impossible to put down, and O'Neal gave out tidbits at regular enough paces that I was satisfied at every turn. Clearly, an absolute ton of research and detailing went into this book. It was well thought out and the details were rich and rang like a bell. O'Neal's love for food is so obvious, but not in your face, and some of the prose itself in this book just made me cry because it was just that beautiful (like when she describes Ivan's voice on that first day that Elena meets him- oh! It just took my breath away).I loved every word of this book- Barbara O'Neal, you have a fan for life!

It was a little more slow-paced than I like, and a little more \"flowery\" in the language, but overall, I enjoyed reading it. (If a section got a little hard to plow through, I just skipped ahead. I read for story...) The heroine is a chef. She's in pretty bad physical shape, with a bad scar down her back, and she's just broken up with her chef boyfriend-boss. There's a tragedy in her past, but she doesn't like to talk about it. When the story opens, an article about her in the paper inflames her ex's vanity into jealousy, and he fires her. But she doesn't have long to be shocked or hurt--as she's leaving the kitchen, the restaurant owner approaches her with an offer to help him open a new restaurant in Aspen. She's no dummy. She jumps at the chance.The book is a slow, syrupy (not as in too sweet, but as in thick) wallowing in wonderful food and textures and the gradual revelation of what brought Elena Alvarez to this point. Her past is revealed, along with her fears, friends and ghosts, and the story follows her struggle to heal from the emotional scars left behind by the tragedy that caused her physical wounds. I loved the recipes. I'm going to make the steak and onion thing sometime soon... I think I like my own carnitas recipe better, tho.I'm reading my way through the 2010 RITA finalists.

Elena wants to be executive chef of a really cool restaurant and have everybody think she's The Shit. But she is Haunted. By the ghosts of her sister and her Soul Mate. Any author that can use the words \"soul mate\" over and over again, without a single soupcon of irony, is not an author anyone wants to read anywhere but on a very boring flight.And also, there is a LOT of sex in this book (spoiler alert: she even gets all sexy with the ghost). There is so much sex in this book that it rapidly becomes incredible tedious sex (for all the gasping, stroking and moaning)and eventually (about half-way thru the book) I had to start skipping over the sex scenes in much the same way that I always skip the battle scenes in War and Peace.

I wish the writer had better developed the characters, written characters I could care about, and somehow shown why these two people fell in love. The story just felt incomplete to me. And the sex scenes seemed really forced, thrown in because it's a \"romance,\" I guess. They added absolutely nothing. Revealed nothing about character desire or about the characters' relationship. Just merely the act. Boring and awkward.I wish more of these writers would write developed stories instead of formulaic romances.

Based in Colorado, and in the kitchen - her writing style is perfect for this amateur baker from the Southern Front Range! The Lost Recipe For Happiness sounded cute, a chef in Aspen? And the cover was gorgeous too, so I dove right in. And I couldn't put it down! Barbara O'Neal's writing is breathtaking, vivid and passionate. As you are turning the pages, you can clearly see the kitchen in the Orange Bear (Elena's Restaurant in Aspen, Colorado) and you feel her aches and pains as well as her emotions. And the tamale's that Ivan created? I can taste them, and left me with a craving for the real thing that would not go away until I had satisfied it with a tamale from my favorite local Mexican Eatery! How to Bake a Perfect Life is a character driven novel, Elena has ghosts (literally) from her past and is struggling to overcome a tragedy that made her who she is. Julian is also filled with ghosts, and ex-wives that haunt him. Together? This is a couple that I could not get enough of, and found myself terribly saddened when the story was ending. I loved each and every one of the characters in this book, for different reasons. But one thing I have to give huge BRAVO to Miss O'Neal for is her Hispanic Characters!! Living in a highly Hispanic population, it's rare to find such a great piece of fiction (especially romantic/chick-lit) that depicts the culture, passion and dedication as well as this story has! This story had me craving tamales and a drive into New Mexico for days after finishing it! I absolutely adored every moment of my time spent inside these pages and found myself sad as it was coming to an end. Barbara O'Neal has quickly become a favorite of mine, and I highly recommend her books to anyone who loves a good character driven novel with a few delicious recipes thrown in!!"}, {"userName": "Karalee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2087264-karalee", "userReview": "In this food lovers' novel, Elena Alvarez is an accomplished Santa Fe-trained chef with Mexican roots and a Southwestern flair to her elegant food. When she is offered the opportunity to become the executive chef at a new restaurant in Aspen, Colorado, owned by a Hollywood director who dabbles in the restaurant business, Elena jumps at the opportunity. But the process of opening the restaurant and developing the menu turns out to be more challenging than Elena expected. She must deal with Ivan, the surly former executive chef who has been demoted to her sous chef and who, despite his culinary brilliance is battled alcohol and personal demons. She also must deal with her intense attraction to Julian Liswood, her boss and, as a Hollywood hottie, someone Elena thinks is totally out of her league (as well as a father to a 14-year old troubled teen). In addition, Elena has physical and emotional scars from a catastrophic car accident from her childhood and both pose obstacles to her ability to realize her dream of running her own successful kitchen. This is the first book I've read by Barbara O'Neal and I was surprised by how much depth and complexity there was to both the plot and characters. I adore books about food, cooking, chefs and the like so the book was a natural draw for me but I was expecting it to be more light-hearted and so its deeper, more complex approach was a welcome surprise. The characters, particularly Elena and Ivan, are deeply scarred but strong and passionate and determined. The book is filled with funny and insightful glimpses into professional kitchens and cooking in a way that is inspiring, rather than intimidating. Overall, a very impressive and enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616365-marleen", "userReview": "I was extremely moved by this book. The characters were beautifully written; they were flawed, broken, hurt. I could really feel the pain they had in their souls because of past tragedies. There's despair and disillusionment, but not to a point where they had given up all hope \u2013 just nearly. Although I'm not that familiar with this cuisine, I enjoyed the pages with all the recipes on Southwestern cooking. Normally I\u2019m not too fond when there\u2019s a lot of cooking and talk of food in a novel, but here it was never boring \u2013 it was colorful and spicy. It fit with the story and I just liked it.The main character is Elena Alvarez, an interesting female chef with origins in New Mexico, but who travelled the world to perfect her skills as a chef. 20 years ago, Elena was the sole survivor of a tragic car accident that took away 4 of her family members, and to this day she has not been able to let go. Also because the accident left her the scars, a crooked back and a lot of daily physical pain.On a side note, I have to point out the book blurb & the synopsis on Goodreads doesn't do the book justice. There\u2019s so much more to this story. For instance, the restaurant owner\u2019s daughter isn\u2019t a troubled teenager \u2013 she\u2019s just a normal, sweet girl who feels a bit lost. I wonder if the people writing book blurbs read the book?I liked many of the male characters; among them the guys working in the kitchen, especially Juan, Ivan and Patrick, the sommelier.To conclude I thought this was a beautiful and poignant read with authentic and well-thought-out characters. The interactions & dialogues resonated with me and I fell in love with Southwestern food! Also, it reminded me a bit of a Jo-Ann Mapson book - and I love that author. I think Barbara O'Neal/Barbara Samuel is just as great."}, {"userName": "Theresa Alan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan", "userReview": "This book is filled with a sumptuous setting of Aspen, Colorado, and sumptuous recipes.

Physically because of her chronic pain and mentally by the deaths of her sister and the man who was the great love of her life. What makes this book enjoyable is that the characters are likeably flawed. They are imperfect people trying to do their best. Julian is trying to guide his teenage daughter away from the excesses of Hollywood, and Elena is licking her wounds from another failed relationship, while doing her best to launch a successful restaurant.

My response to this novel will be mostly positive, because I found it to be a unique narrative amongst the few books I had read so far. The author Barbara O\u2019Neal has used her writing talents to combined different aspect of a woman life to present a story that is exotic and extremely interesting. Elena Alvarez\u2019s character has been presented emotionally and physically. She is going through struggles, to make her painful way to the top of the ladder and reaching a position of a head chef in a new restaurant.The revelation of her past kept haunting her in a farm of a ghost, taking away her peace and harmony. We also notice mystical and paranormal elements which are very strong, but one begins to feel as if they are very natural part of the narrative. \tAnother good part of the novel is the recipe at the end of every chapter. Since this is a story of a chef some dish or drink is always being mentioned. The melody of colors makes the recipes more tempting giving a global view of the good culture and taste. The idea of the recipe at the end of the chapter leaves the readers with something to look forward to and haven\u2019t for the taste buds. I think this is the part I found most unusual and intriguing.\tBarbara O\u2019Neal has definitely made classic effort to make the story, the characters and the plot despicable for the readers. However, there are few that I did not appreciate, one is about a trouble teenager girl\u2019s character, which seem slightly different and off the actual plot. Another factor is also the accident that affected Elena spiritually and physically, but no specific cause for it is stated vividly in the story. One more discrepancy is about the cover of the book and actual narrative inside, irked me, because of the color of dog. \tIn closing, the lost recipe for happiness is a book with rioting, emotions, but enjoyable. As a reader, I felt I have greater understanding how a restaurant is run and the relationships that have to come together, to make a truly successful business. The main Character was well drown and strong yet totally believable. \u201cShe knew the recipe for happiness is worth every risk.\u201d (O\u2019Neal 460)"}, {"userName": "Susan (aka Just My Op)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489613-susan-aka-just-my-op", "userReview": "Chef Elena had a rough childhood \u2013 a father who died before her birth, a mother who abandoned her, and as a saving grace, a grandmother who loved her completely. Her childhood ended with a horrible car wreck, and Elena was the only passenger who survived, barely. So, of course, she carries a lot of emotional as well as physical damage, and certainly doesn't want anyone too close to her. Not even the ghosts of her past.This is a sweet romance novel but not the type I would normally choose to read. I picked it up because I wanted to read something by this author before she meets with local bookclubs. For that reason, I'm not giving it a star rating, just writing what I thought of it.For me, the book didn't have enough storyline and was too long for the story it was telling. There was too much repetition \u2013 how many times do I have to read another description of Elena's scars? There were too many sex/food metaphors and the explicit sex scenes were a bit on the cheesy side. \u201cHe supped of her lower lip....\u201d and \u201c...his organ, ruddy and proud, leaking and leaping....\u201d Blaugh. There were some recipes that sound wonderful, although I'm not likely to try them. They did put me in the mood to make some black bean and green chile tamales, though. What I loved \u2013 the Colorado and New Mexico setting, ghosts, Alvin the dog, and a pit bull/husky mix that wasn't portrayed as a vicious pit that will kill you in your sleep. Information about running a professional kitchen, although there was a little too much of it for me. So, this wasn't the right book for me but those who like romances more than I do might enjoy it."}], "description": "In this sumptuous new novel, Barbara O\u2019Neal offers readers a celebration of food, family, and love as a woman searches for the elusive ingredient we\u2019re all hoping to find\u2026.It\u2019s the opportunity Elena Alvarez has been waiting for\u2013the challenge of running her own kitchen in a world-class restaurant.
