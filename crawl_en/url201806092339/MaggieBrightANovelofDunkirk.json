It\u2019s always makes my history-lovin heart happy. This was one such book \u2013 with the miraculous rescue from the beaches of Dunkirk.This is one of those books I really REALLY wanted to love. The cover is beautiful and the story is a period I love reading about. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t like this book, but there was something missing. I think it was the pacing of the story. The plot is an incredibly interesting one, but it took a while for me to connect and commit to the story.This story also sheds light on many of the atrocities committed by the Nazis. It\u2019s always so hard to read about, but I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t shied away from, because it\u2019s important to remember. As I mentioned, I also hadn\u2019t heard about the history of Dunkirk, so that was really interesting to learn about.If you\u2019ve enjoyed Groot\u2019s previous work, I think you\u2019ll enjoy this one.

Tracy Groot writes from a deep well of creativity, thoughtfulness, and historical accuracy. Her book is chock full of history--from the perspective of the soldiers fleeing their way to Dunkirk, to the life of people at home in Britian during the war. I love the British culture that brims over into all her chapters (pablum and tea, and stiff-upper-lip), and the characters full of rich personality. Murray struggles with Asberger's and has to constantly make his mind think in a logical sequence instead of wandering--but in the midst of his pain, he finds joy as he gives the world the cartoons of Rocket Kid and Salamander. Mrs. Shrewsbury, retired schoolteacher, finds fresh strength to serve and give to her nation, while wielding teakettles against a Burglar Vicar. William Percy is eaten up with his anger at Hitler exterminating disabled children, and finds Claire's ability to put his feelings into words heart-stirring. Tracy's writing is full of deep creativity, richness, and subtlety.Perhaps the other theme that stood out so deeply in this book was the theme of the shatterer coming against Britain--and the power of prayer to hold it back. Claire and Percy--neither of them religious, but both full of kindness--encounter the prospect of the majority of the British Army trapped under German gunfire. They join the nation in a call to prayer--and realize that perhaps there is a God, and prayer is the greatest weapon to stand against this huge shattering destruction looming over their land (Nahum 2:1).The other point of view--Jamie, a soldier who is assigned to get a wounded captain to Dunkirk is also full of richness. The character of the captain--a man who is wounded, has lost his men, and can only speak with lines of Milton's Paradise Lost--is also righ with emotion. As Jamie learns to get past the incessant Milton, he and his comrades find strength and inspiration from the lines that seem so random, but might not actually be random after all. Fyi, his chapters contain some crude language (this book has a fair amount of it, but it's British swearing, and some readers might not consider it language).This is historical fiction at its best--rich, packed with history, original, full of lovable characters slowly finding the power of prayer to stand against a huge enemy. It was a theme that resonated with me. While this book contains language, and there were a couple of plot lines that I would have preferred wrapped up tighter, this is a hands-down favorite, and I look forward to reading it with my mom and sister in the near future. This is truly a story you won't want to miss. I can't wait to read more of Tracy Groot's books in future. They make me happy to the core of my historical-fiction loving soul.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Tyndale.

Can the truth be more disturbing than the fact that the vicar was after something on her boat? Surely not. But something is not quite right. More and more people are becoming involved in her mystery and on top of that a sense of danger begins to pervade the air \u2013 something true of both Clare\u2019s personal life and of England as a whole as Nazi forces move closer to English shores.

Some books I really really enjoy yet there are certain elements that left me confused, annoyed and disgusted. Maggie Bright was just perfect though \u2013 the way the story was told, the well-developed characters, the heart-wrenching setting of war and all of it\u2019s ugly realities. Tracy Groot seamlessly wove together a story of many lives. It was easy to follow along with though readers should be prepared to be blown out of their seats by the surprises that occur. This is a book that it is not to be missed. After finishing it I was debating whether or not I should go back and reread it, but, well\u2026real life DOES exist (whodda thunk?). Now the other books I\u2019m currently reading are paling in comparison and I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to get out of this rut. Thanks, Tracy, couldn\u2019t have done it without you. -_-Many moons ago I picked up a Tracy Groot story, disliked it and logged the name in my mind as an author to avoid.

But once I picked it back up, I couldn't put it down! I'd given a copy to my mom, since I got the kindle version for a good deal, and she finished it before me and said I'd enjoy it, and I did! The characters are very engaging, such as the Shrew, Murray, Sir William (I think that was his name), the soldiers--even though Griggs aggravated me at first--and just all the people in there, and the writing absorbs you (at least it did for my mom and me). Sometimes I got confused about the setting and who was talking, but other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. By about 30%, I found myself being more and more drawn into the story.

I was especially excited to see a different perspective on World War II history. I hoped for the same gritty action, characterization and fast pace that Sentinels had but was disappointed to find a much slower pace in Maggie Bright.At times the massive amount of dialogue in Maggie Bright becomes too much to keep track of with so many characters. Many times I had to reread a section to remember who was talking. I enjoyed the dialogue as well as her descriptions though. Clare was a great lead character but I would have enjoyed getting to know her even deeper especially in her spiritual life and her romantic life. Her voice was strong and impassioned about her ship but little else. By the end there were so many characters to keep up with that were integral parts to the story that I found myself distracted from the story keeping people\u2019s names straight and I never did connect deeply with any of the characters. I was also surprised when the book ended with a s my honest review.econdary character wrapping up the story instead of one of the main characters.Maggie Bright didn\u2019t start slow but it also never picked up either. I was invested enough in the story to continue reading but if it hadn\u2019t been for the slight mystery to the story I might have lost interest. Thankfully there were a couple elements of surprise and intrigue to keep me reading. The elements of intrigue offered a decent amount of conflict but the majority of the conflict in the story was war related. The soldiers trying to survive the perils of battle and bombings were just enough to keep me concerned for their well-being. There was a tiny amount of romantic tension too but the two went from almost being adversaries to being \u201cin-love\u201d so easily that it was quite unbelievable. I wish they had worked a little harder for it.In the end, Groot did was she does best \u2013 research. She told the story of the Dunkirk evacuation so well that you felt you were there and found yourself hoping that as many of the soldiers as possible would make it out alive. She took a fairly unknown piece of history and weaved a fiction to it in a way that even those not interested in history would enjoy. This is a very original work and fits perfectly with Groot\u2019s style of writing. I loved that she doesn\u2019t mince words about the nitty gritty side of war.Obviously since this is a war related novel there are many elements of starvation, death, and injury that might be difficult for some readers to stomach. But Groot is careful not to put any of these elements into the book for show, but simply to properly set the tone for the book.I felt the spiritual elements of the story were downplayed enough that even a non-Christian could pick up this book and not be offended by the mentions of prayer. Since everyone was praying for the soldiers and for the war to end at this time in history I don\u2019t feel like it was out of place in the story even for a non-Believer. I also feel a teenager could read this book as long as they are prepared for the gruesome side of war.Overall Maggie Bright was an excellent peek into what it might have been like to be in England and France during 1940. The unique setting of Dunkirk was an intriguing time and place and made for a very interesting read. I received a copy of the book from the publisher.

Focusing on the retreat of the British Army to the beaches of Dunkirk, Groot tells the story of young soldiers retreating with no idea what is in store for them once they reach the beaches of Dunkirk. Tracy Groot, an amazing storyteller, tells a wonderful story behind the heroism of actual history. This is a story of average British citizens with a love for their island and their soldiers. If you possess a passion for a tale of self-sacrificing, patriotic, intense bravery, this is the book for you. My admiration is strong for such stories, especially when we know that while the novel is fiction, the history is real. There are never enough stars to give to books like this.

I personally did not know much about Dunkirk before reading this book from popular Christian author Tracy Groot. As with much historical fiction, this book gives a good perspective on the actual events, opening the reader's eyes allowing him to experience the events through reading. This book was difficult to begin. The writing style was at first confusing as were the characters. However, almost magically, three chapters into the book I was engrossed and couldn't put the book down. Maybe it was just me, but more likely the author had a hard time beginning the story. Not to be negative, but the same situation repeats itself for the last two chapters of the book. They are just a little confusing with too much action and to many conclusions in a short amount of pages. Nevertheless, negative points aside, this book was a pleasure to read! \u00a0\u00a0 I was worried that it would be simply a romance with little historical quality. I was happily surprised to find that the romance is tastefully added to this novel without taking over the tale. I mean, there is no kissing. For a world war 2-based book (or movie for that matter!) this is phenomenal. Not to mention a nice change. The story in this book focuses more on action and character development. There are two different perspectives: Clare Child's on the homefront of England, and a small remnant of the British division over near Dunkirk (and finally, at Dunkirk). Unfortunately, the latter group was hard to really ''get to know'' in this book. The author tended to over do it with English sayings and jokes. She also did this with Clare Childs in a sense, which showed the author has a more televised understanding of English people. But I still enjoyed this book. It really captured the setting and mood of the time and location. I hate to be negative again, since this was a pleasant book but I must add that this is not an intensely Christian book. In fact I was a little confused by the point of the author on that subject. I gather that she was trying to appease both Catholics and Protestants in this book. The main character comes to a good realization of God's sovereignty but I was left a little bewildered nevertheless.\u00a0 In short, this book was not the most well-written and thought-out yet it captured my attention and interest for it's majority. Most of the characters were very realistic and enjoyable as was the setting. The romance was tasteful.

This story is a true winner, the most beautiful yet. I've always been fascinated by the miracle at Dunkirk but never actually knew very much about it, just that a lot of British troops backed up against a wall were rescued in a an amazing fashion. This book does a fantastic job illuminating those days and the astounding courage that was displayed by so many in so many different ways. The characters are all skillfully drawn, quirky in their own delightful ways, and quite endearing, the whole lot of them (even Griggs). I wanted to know what was going to happen to every single one of them and couldn't stop until I found out. The story is complex, mysterious at points, heart wrenching, and random like only Tracy Groot can do. In previous works, Tracy's capricious writing style has bordered on the nearly chaotic, making it difficult to follow at times, but in this book she balances being out of the ordinary in her sentence structures, word choices, conversation meanderings, and plot devices, with enough clear structure that you're not left bewildered. I really liked the theme of prayer that is delicately woven into the story. The characters wrestle with just what prayer does and why it is important. While all of the answers are not clearly arrived at, a lot is learned along the way, and, most importantly, prayer is beautified and made lovely, stoking my desire to pray.This is the type of book you rip through because it's so good and then after the dust clears and you realize it's over, you're sad that it went by so fast. I sure hope Tracy writes a sequel to this one as there's still a lot more to be explored with these characters. This is such a beautiful story and one that will stay with me for a long time I'm sure. Content Advisory: There is regretfully a smattering of rough language in this book. You will encounter some British course terms (bloody being the most frequently used) and a few other words that I wished weren't utilized. This book does also contain some violence and blood and gore. There are also a few adult themes slightly touched on that obviously wouldn't be appropriate for the younger set."}, {"userName": "Victor Gentile", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528881-victor-gentile", "userReview": "Tracy Groot in her new book, \u201cMaggie Bright\u201d published by Tyndale House Publishers brings us into the life of Clare Childs.From the Back Cover: England, 1940.Clare Childs knew life would change when she unexpectedly inherited the Maggie Bright\u2015a noble fifty-two-foot yacht.

I gave it a shot, but I just couldn't do it. Historical fiction about a subject I'm vastly interested in, and I just couldn't get through it. We all have reading \"pet peeves\" don't we? One of mine is skipping between narrators. For me, it usually doesn't work. This was exactly the case here. I read the first four chapters (which were only a few pages each), which introduced three different narrators: one from England, one from the US, and one from England who was on the European continent. I got a hefty case of whiplash in the approximately twenty pages it took for the first four chapters to be done. This is going on my \"Try Again Later\" shelf. Maybe I will be ready to read it in the future. For now, it just didn't cut it for me."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3091200-katie", "userReview": "Absolutely chilling in its descriptions of war and courage.  Maggie Bright  is not a fast read, but it is an engrossing read. I've read a lot about WW2 but haven't even heard about Dunkirk (where have I been???). Not knowing what to expect, I was apprehensive about reading this book. But once again, Tracy Groot blew me away. Full of historical details and figures yet it was never dry. I am amazed at the courage of the civilians who answered the call to risk their lives to help the BEF evacuate from Dunkirk. I loved the emphasis on prayer (without being overly religious). This is a fantastic read about the beginning of WW2 and the fall of continental Europe. It's gritty and heartbreaking while being inspiring and hopeful."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "This is my third Tracy Groot novel. The style was similar to The Sentinels of Andersonville however not as satisfying. I found the first third of the novel to move along rather slowly. I nearly gave up at around page 100, but am very thankful I kept reading. Things picked up nicely after that point.The storyline was fabulous, the back story is amazing, the characters beautifully done and the language delightful. Somehow all the pieces didn't fit together perfectly though.Overall, I enjoyed this novel and am glad I read it. The story of the soldiers of Dunkirk is incredibly interesting."}, {"userName": "Gail Kittleson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18121842-gail-kittleson", "userReview": "Maggie Bright, like Tracy's other novels, doesn't disappoint. I've never understood so much about what Dunkirk meant to the British. The devastating suffering and defeat they experienced created an opportunity, though, for citizens to come to the aid of the military in an incredible effort. Gives me shivers thinking about their courage and tenacity. To anyone wondering, I say, READ THIS BOOK!!

Clare Childs knew life would change when she unexpectedly inherited the Maggie Bright--a noble fifty-two-foot yacht. In fact, she's counting on it. But the boat harbors secrets. When a stranger arrives, searching for documents hidden onboard, Clare is pulled into a Scotland Yard investigation that could shed light on Hitler's darkest schemes and prompt America to action.Across the Channel, Hitler's Blitzkrieg has the entire British army in retreat with little hope for rescue at the shallow beaches of Dunkirk. With time running out, Churchill recruits civilian watercraft to help. Hitler is attacking from land, air, and sea, and any boat that goes might not return. Yet Clare knows Maggie Bright must answer the call--piloted by an American who has refused to join the war effort until now and a detective with a very personal motive for exposing the truth.The fate of the war hinges on this rescue. While two men join the desperate fight, a nation prays for a miracle.This is a lovely book. It's lovely and touching, filled with heroism, inspiration, bravery, and friendship. The characters are so real; you can reach out and touch them. It's a delightful read that brings the fear, the horror, and the joy of Dunkirk's miracle alive. There is no doubt in my mind that the rescue of hundreds of thousands of men was, indeed, a miracle. Whether it was a miracle brought about by man or deity, no one knows, nor does it matter. I cried over Milton; he was special and good and true, despite his injury and it's result. I had the feeling that he knew what was going to happen, that he could foresee, perhaps due to his injury, what was coming. I do wish it had been possible to know more of him and his life before the war. What encouraged him to join the army, where he lived, what his family was like? He's such a compassionate and caring person. To me, he made the book work.Clare was sweet and so very positive. Mrs. Shrew? Well, I've had teachers like her. They're tough, but you learn from them. While she's retired, in her way, she continues teaching those around her. She's brave and forthright, and she has a good heart. I would have liked to know if anything develops between her and that man. Murry was perfect. I could see this young man, his pain, his goodness, and his artistic ability. I want to see those comic books he wrote and drew, Rocket Kid and Salamander. In my imagination, they're amazing works of art. And William's transformation was heartwarming to watch. It happens slowly, well as slowly as things can happen in the span of a week, for that's about the time that transpires between the beginning and end of the book. I did feel that some of the relationships were a bit rushed and should have developed over a longer period, but I also understand the author's desire to compress the time period to highlight all that was going on. Jamie, Baylor, and Griggs were perfect for their roles. How could you not love Jamie and Baylor, at their gentleness and caring, and bristle at Griggs' gruffness. But they all did what needed doing and were heroes, one and all. I questioned a few small details. For one, William's young sister is allowed to visit a patient in a hospital. Unless rules in the UK were very different then from what they were in the US, I think it highly unlikely. As a child in the 60s, I wasn't allowed to visit my mother when she was in the hospital. It was thought that children would carry infection and endanger the patients. Also, the patient says she sucked on ice. As I understand, refrigerators were not a big thing in the UK until after WWII, and warm drinks were more likely available than cold. Would the hospital have provided ice to its patients? I don't know, but it seems unlikely. For one of the other things I noted, the author explains her reasoning for choosing the term she used at the end of the book. I would not call this a Christian book; it much more inspirational in a mostly nondenominational way. There is no strong persuasion of any one religion mentioned, and little religious text quoted. There is a great emphasis on prayer, not surprising given the dire situation faced by England in the face of its army being trapped in France with nowhere to run or hide. Prayer is for everyone, not just Christians, and I thought it perfectly suiting. I did think that at times, discussion of it popped up out of nowhere and interrupted the flow of the story, but it was always over quickly and then the action moved on. The inclusion of this emphasis on prayer did not surprise me given the publisher of the book. It also did not diminish my enjoyment of the story.All the quotes from Milton through Milty/Captain Jacobs were remarkable and fitting. It makes me curious, and I will likely look up several of the quotes used. I adored the small band of military brothers who would join in as Milty quoted. I'd love to see a sequel to this book that occurs after the war, having all return safely and join together at Milton's.All in all, this was a highly enjoyable read. I'd happily read another book by Tracy Groot.I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway. I thank Goodreads, the author, and the publisher for the opportunity to read this wonderful book."}, {"userName": "Raelee Carpenter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29758873-raelee-carpenter", "userReview": "I don't usually like to read about war, but this book wrecked me in all the best ways."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34173853-miriam", "userReview": "Couldn't really get into it, so don't want to say anything negative without really reading it all the way through."}], "description": "2016 Christian Book Award finalist (Fiction category)England, 1940.
