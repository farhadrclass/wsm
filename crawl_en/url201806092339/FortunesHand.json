He was an idealistic young teacher, full of vibrant hopes and dreams and determined to shape the young minds of the future in the best way possible. He was blissfully happy to be engaged to his high school sweetheart, and together, this charmed couple were planning for the future. Yes, Robb McDaniel was truly blessed and thankful for everything he had in life: until he wanted something more.Upon receiving a sudden windfall, money that is tragically earned, Robb is offered the chance to live a different sort of life. He is offered the opportunity of going to law school and of pursuing a brilliant career. Yet nothing in Robb McDaniel's life could possibly have prepared him for the price of a dream come true.A job with a prestigious law firm. Marriage to the boss' daughter. A wonderful family. A splendid home. In fact, Robb had everything that he could possibly want, and more besides. All the offers and prominence he just couldn't refuse. Truly, Robb McDaniel was living a life of great success, greater hunger, greatest shame...In her latest novel, best-selling author Belva Plain creates a riveting and compelling portrait of a man who had everything - and of the women who loved him. With a profound insight, she explores the power of temptation, betrayal, and greed - and the ultimately redeeming gift of love. This is a story of great complexity and heart-aching poignancy.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. In my opinion, Belva Plain was a terrific author, and she really did a tremendous job of capturing the various nuances and complexities of her characters' relationships and weaving them all into an emotional and intriguing story. I've always enjoyed reading books about families and their sometimes troubled and dysfunctional relationships. I would give this book a definite A+!"}, {"userName": "Arwen56", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9615245-arwen56", "userReview": "Beh, il protagonista avr\u00e0 anche avuto un colpo di fortuna, ma il problema \u00e8 che, nel 2003, io ho invece avuto il colpo di sfiga di acquistare il romanzo. :-("}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6652595-lynn", "userReview": "I haven't read Belva Plain for quite a while and was pleased to discover this book at the library.

They contentedly plan to live forever, together in their small town- he as a teacher and she as a librarian-until he receives an insurance settlement from his parents\u2019 deaths. Suddenly, he is financially able to afford to pursue his dream of law school, and Lily, patiently waits for him. Though faithful to Lily, he meets and falls in love with Ellen. Soon he breaks Lily\u2019s heart, stifles his guilt and marries Ellen. Life seemed charmed-great career, loving wife, precious daughter and then, icing on the cake, a son. Unfortunately, the son is developmentally impaired, and all their money and connections can\u2019t fix him. Then Robb becomes more and more successful and moves further away from the idealistic young man Lily, and Ellen loved."}, {"userName": "elliereads", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5016645-elliereads", "userReview": "I used to enjoy the family fluff of Plain's stories, and when I saw this at the library, I realized I had missed it back when I read her books with more frequency. Suffice it to say I found it boring and mired in details about one character's business dealings. The family dynamics were secondary to a faulty corruption filled plot. This is the second book I've read in as many days in which the main character commits suicide in effort to solve problems. It seems like an easy out for the writers."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52925980-ann", "userReview": "Funny little book. Once the first twist occurred, I felt like I had to keep going. Although the story is set in the 1970s - 1990s, it somehow felt like it was happening a generation ago, the way the people spoke and acted. As a parent of a special needs kid myself, I enjoyed the inclusion of a 'special' child in the plot, and was heartened by how loving the family was towards the child in the face of scorn from both outsiders and other members of the family."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth", "userReview": "ordered the book and the unabridged 10 cd set from the libraryheard the 6 hr tape editionFor now: a book about men's roles and status vs women's roles and status, class, the urban rural divide as it shows up in stigma, prejudice and class and disability.

It's a bit melodramatic in places. Not as good as previous books I have read by the author. Now that I'm done with the book I can't say I liked the main character much at all as he had so many flaws.
