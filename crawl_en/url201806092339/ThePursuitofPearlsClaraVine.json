The author says that the Clara Vine novels can be read as stand alone so I decided to go with the fourth book in the series even though I haven't read the first two. Intrigue and espionage and a murder right at the beginning and love stories in Germany and Paris in 1939 . I remembered immediately why I liked Clara Vine so much - she's smart and gutsy and caring . She's half British , half German , Jewish, an actress and a spy for British Intelligence. Then it felt a little slow at about a third of the way in and I really couldn't wait for more to happen. I have to admit that I skimmed a good portion in the middle to get to where it grabbed my interest again.Having said that, I still found Clara Vine to be a compelling character. We see the chilling Nazi beliefs personified in the fictionalized characters of the real life Himmler and Goebbels among others and Faith and Beauty Society grooming young girls to be the perfect wives for Nazi officials. But we also see the courage of characters like Clara and Leo and others who while are fictional characters must represent some courageous people who actually worked for the Allies against the Nazis. Even though, I have given this three stars mainly because it felt a bit dragged out, the ending left me interested enough in finding out what happens to Clara Vine. I received an ARC of this book from Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine."}, {"userName": "Simone St James", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2139454-simone-st-james", "userReview": "Seriously, seriously wonderful.

Once I started The Pursuit of Pearls, I could not put it down. This is the first Clara Vine book that I have read and didn\u2019t realize it was a series until I finished it. Next, I plan to track down her earlier books and read them too. The book opens in Berlin in 1939 on the eve of World War II. Hitler and his regime are midway through the crackdown on Jews \u2013 Kristallnacht has already occurred, and Jews are being forced out of their homes and their businesses. Nazi propaganda abounds, and many Germans, Jewish or otherwise, live in a constant state of fear. The Nazis have created a finishing school for women called The Faith and Beauty Society, the purpose of which is to churn out acceptable brides for high ranking Nazis. The story focuses on both the murder of Lottie Franke, a student at the Faith and Beauty Society, and Clara Vine, a German actress who is working for the British Intelligence Agency. As the book progresses, the two plot lines converge.Jane Thynne\u2019s painstaking and detailed research into the Nazi Party during this time period makes the book absolutely fascinating. I was captivated by descriptions of the various party leaders including Goebbels, Goring, and Himmler and their spouses, and the amount of dissention that existed between the various leaders. Her writing made me feel like I was transported to Berlin and Paris along with Clara. She also includes a fair amount about the German film industry at that time and interesting tidbits about the amount of effort and detail that went into sewing the numerous Nazi uniforms. The amount of day to day control exerted over the German citizens and the inability of anyone to leave Germany without a very valid excuse even in 1939 (not just Jews) was new information for me. I also learned that the Nazis were in Paris and London in 1939 cataloging the treasures in each city and then compiling a list of people who had spoken out against the Nazis so that they could be punished when Hitler took over their cities. Hitler\u2019s confidence in his supremacy apparently knew no bounds. Many other historical figures from that time period are included in The Pursuit of Pearls, and I found myself frequently looking them up to learn more about those individuals. This book is one of the best books I have read in a long time. The Pursuit of Pearls is a must read for anyone who enjoys historical fiction but will definitely appeal to any avid reader.Thanks to NetGalley, the publisher, and the author for the opportunity to read this novel in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "The Lit Bitch", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4537892-the-lit-bitch", "userReview": "This book is marketed to fans of Jacqueline Winspear and Susan Elia MacNeal. I would say that\u2019s a pretty accurate fan base. I found myself thinking this was similar to both authors but this book was a little different for me. One of the first things I noticed was this book is deeply set in the Nazi Reich while the other authors primarily focus on Britain as a setting or backdrop.The backdrop/setting for this book was really really interesting. I guess I never stopped to think about what German culture was like during the years leading up to the WWII. So I was immediately sucked into the German cultural world that this novel highlighted. The Faith and Beauty girls were an interesting organization and while many of the historical aspects of the novel might not be completely \u2018accurate\u2019 I was super interested in it nevertheless. I would have read this book for that reason alone! Very well done and engaging for readers!I haven\u2019t read any of the other books in this series and for being four books in, I didn\u2019t feel that lost in the story. The author did a nice job at helping the reader navigate previous events, however there were a few times when I felt like there was something I was missing for example, I wondered if there wasn\u2019t more to the relationship between Clara and her sister/family. I felt like maybe there was more that I was missing from previous books. However, on the whole I felt like this book could easily have been read as a standalone.There was part of me that felt like the murder mystery part took a little too long to develop. The murder did happen very early on in the story which I appreciated, but personally I felt like it took a while to get into the murder aspect which I found a little frustrating. Having it happen so early made me want to start investigating right away but instead more emphasis seemed to be put on getting all the characters into their positions within the story.That said, I really enjoyed reading this one and felt that the premise and mystery were both interesting and adequate. I liked the spy angle of the story and found it very intriguing and believable.This was a fun murder/spy mystery novel that could be read as a standalone but would obviously be enriched by the previous novels. It takes you somewhere completely different and adds a unique perspective to the story having it set in Nazi Germany so I would encourage readers to give this one a shot!See my full review here"}, {"userName": "DeB MaRtEnS", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb-martens", "userReview": "Pursuit of Pearls is a very, very light treatment of Berlin just prior to WWII. Clara Vine is an actress, secretly a German Jewess on her mother's side and whose father is a well-known British pro-Nazi supporter. She is also a spy, being recruited in an earlier novel by her lover Leo who has gone missing in Vienna. The cast of characters is substantial, incorporating the upper echelons of the Nazi party such as Goering and Goebels as well as Hitler into major parts in the plot, as well as the fictional ones. The novel is saturated with period details, such as Hitler hating red lipstick and denouncing those women who chose to wear it because they countered the image of the fresh faced wholesome Nazi female ideal. Though interesting, I felt that setting featured most strongly in the story, overwhelming character development and supplanting the intended suspense of the plot. Though the fourth in a series featuring Clara Vine, Pursuit of Pearls stood alone easily. I believe that this book would be enjoyed by those who have little familiarity with WWII history, or the time preceding it and likely would be very suitable for those who like historical fiction, written with a light but informed hand."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5083975-renee", "userReview": "This story made me feel like I'd been transported to Berlin in 1939 & was experiencing the drama for myself.

HawesThe Pursuit of Pearls is everything you hope a novel will be. And, I\u2019m not exaggerating. Except, perhaps, in my ambitious use of the word \u201cyou,\u201d because this assumes we share similar criteria. A perfect novel means I\u2019m entertained and I want to keep reading even though I have other things to do. And, I\u2019d love a chance to meet the author for cocktails because I know they\u2019d be fun and fascinating to talk to.It is so blindingly obvious that Jane Thynne is bright, thoughtful, and a great conversationalist. Just read her Clara Vine series and you\u2019ll know these statements, while sounding suspiciously hyperbolic, are only the truth.I\u2019m so thrilled she\u2019s joining us today at Book Club Babble.Amy M. Hawes: In The Pursuit of Pearls, your heroine, Clara Vine, experiences varied encounters with those inside and outside the Nazi regime. You do a wonderful job of showing the many shades of grey between hero and villain by revealing how hypocritical, and therefore distinctly human, these characters are. How important was it to you to convey that even in a regime as inhumane as Hitler\u2019s, the people involved were indeed people?Jane Thynne: Hi Amy and Book Club Babble! I\u2019m so glad you understood one of my main interests in the Clara Vine thrillers, which was to get a glimpse behind the private life of the Third Reich. I think viewing the Nazi leaders on the human scale \u2013 as fathers, lovers and husbands \u2013 is not prurient \u2013 it just makes their activities more repellent than ever. Yet it was the predicament of the women that really fascinated me. I wanted to explore what it would be like to be married to a man who was responsible for such atrocities. Would it be a gilded cage, or did these women actually support what their husbands did? I discovered that some, like Lina Heydrich, were considered more fanatical Nazis than their men \u2013 whereas others, like Emmy Goering, actively interceded on an occasional basis to save friends. Henriette, the wife of Baldur von Schirach, went further and protested to Hitler himself, and was banished from his presence thereafter. The Pursuit of Pearls features Annelies von Ribbentrop, the wife of the Foreign Minister. She was an ardent Nazi and it was her hatred for England that was considered to have influenced von Ribbentrop in 1939 when he urged Hitler towards war.AH: I was particularly fascinated with your portrayal of the Nazi-run finishing schools for girls, such as the Faith and Beauty Society, where every girl \u201cmust be blond and blue-eyed\u2013the precise color was measured against a chart containing sixty different shades . . .\u201d And before marriage to a member of the SS, potential brides were quantified and tested as if they were inanimate objects for purchase. Interestingly, all of these practices were dictated by a man who didn\u2019t meet any of his own standards for male Aryan perfection. Nazi Germany may have taken the objectification of the female to its ultimate extreme but there is no question there are still different standards for men and women when it comes to their physical appearance. Do you believe looking at this concept in its most exaggerated form helps underscore the inherent unfairness and danger of engaging in this practice on any scale?JT: I really do. It seems incredible to us now that ordinary twentieth century German women would submit to having their noses and foreheads measured and their bodies examined in bathing costumes in order to qualify for marriage to certain men. The extreme misogyny of this society meant that every aspect of women\u2019s lives was patrolled, from the ban on smoking and cosmetics, to Hitler\u2019s creation of a Reich Fashion Bureau promoting wide-hipped traditional dresses that were intended to encourage the right body shape for fecundity. The more I studied Nazi institutions like Bride Schools, which taught women how to obey their husbands, the more I was reminded of Margaret Atwood\u2019s A Handmaid\u2019s Tale. I think we absolutely should draw lessons about the objectification of women, and the way women are encouraged to conform to a male-given agenda, but also to the double-standards some people are willing to live by. Clara Vine manages to exist as a single woman in the Nazi echelons because she is a glamorous actress and they were exempt from the strictures that governed the rest of Aryan female society.AH: The concept of performance is a constant thread through your novel, and seemingly throughout Nazi Germany. From the parades involving fifty thousand soldiers, the propaganda newsreels before films, or Hitler\u2019s obsession with film itself, the notion of performance is always \u201con show.\u201d Pun intended! As I see it, this focus reflects an absolute obsession with caring what other people think. So much so, the goal is to control thought and opinion by controlling what is seen. Was this concept of performance involved in your choice to make your heroine an actress?JT: You\u2019re right. When I decided Clara Vine should be an actress, it made so much sense. Not only was Babelsberg the Hollywood of Europe in the 1930s, responsible for iconic movies like Metropolis and The Blue Angel, but Clara\u2019s acting talent gives her access to VIP circles and the ability to conceal her espionage. Acting highlights the difference between how things are and how they seem; a notion that underlies much of the novel. As you say, this was a regime that was obsessed with acting and film. Hitler would watch two movies a day and Goebbels saw the visual portrayal of a powerful, orderly Nazi Germany as a vital accompaniment to Hitler\u2019s territorial ambitions.AH: I\u2019ve been playing with makeup and clothes from the moment I had a concept of what they were. And like a mynah bird, anything sparkly immediately grabs my interest. So when your novel taught me that makeup, fashion, and adornment of the female figure was discouraged in Nazi-controlled Germany, it got me to thinking what it would be like for me to live in that sort of culture. Most of your characters either embrace or reject the Nazi recommendations in manners of appearance, but what do you think the level of internal conflict was within the young women who grew up under this regime?JT: Obviously it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing about the regime, but the strictures on women\u2019s appearance were very strong, especially in the early days of the Third Reich. Smoking was frowned on \u2013 shops were banned from selling cigarettes to women, and storm-troopers were encouraged to dash any cigarette from women\u2019s lips. Lipstick, hair dye, nail polish, even perfume were degenerate, but as was typical of the Nazis, the VIP women who were supposed to embody these values generally did the opposite \u2013 Eva Braun used to take Hitler perfume shopping, Hermann Goering gave out Elizabeth Arden gift sets. I think these ironies, hypocrisies, and mixed messages were what fascinated me about the period. Yet for the ordinary young woman, life was very regimented and most seem to have adapted willingly to this iron control. It\u2019s the ones who didn\u2019t that interest me!AH: One of the most enjoyable aspects of your Clara Vine novels is how replete they are with historical fact. For example, I never knew Linzer tortes were named after Hitler\u2019s birthplace. And I must admit, I can relate to Ms. Vine\u2019s reaction while gazing at one of these tortes, \u201cdespite its unfortunate associations, Clara could not stop her mouth from watering . . .\u201d I can only imagine you adore research since you incorporate so many facts with such effortlessness. Is it truly effortless? How do insert the truth in fiction without making it appear forced and do you enjoy the challenge?JT: Oh, I really do love the research. It\u2019s my favorite part I think. Walking around Berlin and Munich, seeing in my mind the buildings that were there like a palimpsest beneath what has replaced them. Finding buildings like the Berlin Bride School that I never knew existed. Or discovering a tiny piece of color \u2013 like the fact that Hermann Goering always kept a lion cub in his home. The danger with research of course is that you have to lose most of it, or you end up as a history lesson, and not a thriller at all.AH: I recently listened to a radio expos\u00e9 regarding the use of group gymnastics to instill a sense of hegemony within a people, while simultaneously subverting the notion of individuality. Apparently, it is an incredibly effective training tool. It\u2019s no surprise that Nazi Germany employed this resource, as you reference in your novel. The dynamic between the goals of the government and the irrepressibility of the individual is beautifully contrasted in The Pursuit of Pearls. Do you enjoy exploring this contrast, as much as your work seems to suggest?JT: Totalitarian societies make for miserable living but great fiction. Just look at any of the novels set in the time of Henry VIII, or The Hunger Games series, or 1984. (I hasten to say I wouldn\u2019t dare compare myself to Orwell!) But there is great dramatic tension between the masses who conform, the state that polices that conformity, and the individual who slips through the cracks. That\u2019s what interests the novelist \u2013 the outsider who survives in a repressive society. The Nazis put a premium on group activity \u2013 they tried to arrange it so that people spent as little time alone as possible because solitude promotes individual thinking. As a spy, Clara herself is an outsider posing as an insider, but so is the character of Lottie Frank, who is considered too intellectual and subversive for the finishing school she attends, and ultimately pays for her free spirit.AH: It\u2019s always been a belief of mine that if too many restrictions are put on a person, whether they are self-imposed or otherwise, it is human nature to revolt against them. I think of the man who is very polite and stoic in nature but when it comes to his favorite sports team he allows himself to turn into a raving, barely-controlled lunatic who is permitted to yell and curse at people he doesn\u2019t even know. As I read your book, I wondered if the Nazi encouragement of sexuality, purportedly for the purpose of creating more babies for the Aryan nation, might have been an unconscious reaction to a hyper-regimented existence? Considering the shortages in food, was it really wise to be increasing the population? Hah, of course\u2013\u201cThey had been told that bread, sugar, and coffee were in short supply because the F\u00fchrer wanted to increase the facial fitness of the nation.\u201d Your thoughts?JT: The Nazi attitude to sexuality was, typically for such a dreadful regime, a mess of contradictions. An emphasis on female modesty was allied with encouragement of unmarried motherhood, and a traditionally Protestant nation was asked to welcome ideas from Himmler such as superior men having two wives. At its extreme it embodied horrors like the Lebensborn, which encouraged girls to Give A Child to the F\u00fchrer through casual sex with an SS man. It also meant the criminalization of homosexuality. The drive to increase the birth rate was so strong that the League of German Girls, the BDM, was nicknamed the Bald Deutscher Mutter \u2013 soon-to-be German mothers \u2013 and 16-year-olds would regularly return from the Nuremberg rally pregnant. But I don\u2019t think anything was ever about female sexual pleasure. Ultimately, official attitudes to sexuality were governed by one thing \u2013 what suited men, and in particular the top men of the regime.AH: The era you center your novel in was one which yielded profound worldwide consequences, I have to ask if beyond the undeniable entertainment and thought-provoking qualities of your Clara Vine novels, are there any other sentiments you hope to touch in others through your writing?JT: I\u2019m always very conscious that I\u2019m writing about a period that wrought devastation to so many millions of lives. I may be writing about individual murders but they are taking place against a backdrop of far greater crime. Even while I\u2019m mostly focused on the lives of ordinary Aryan women in Nazi Germany (though Clara herself is part-Jewish) I never want to forget the actions of the men I write about. The value of writing a chronological series is that I can chart the changes in people\u2019s attitudes as they either accommodate or resist the Nazis. In particular, it\u2019s the efforts of resistance by ordinary citizens, such as the group featured in The Pursuit of Pearls that I want to bring to light.Jane Thynne is the author of several novels, including The Scent of Secrets and The Pursuit of Pearls.

Immediately we are swept away with the faith and beauty society, the goings on and inner workings, of this elite clique of Aryan German women being groomed for the future of the Reich! However, it becomes clear that not everything is as it seems and the \u2018Third Reich\u2019s vestal virgins\u2019 are not as pure as the Nazi movement would have you believe\u2026\u2026\u2026.The idea of a society that can manipulate women in to roles and re-define their journeys through adulthood, almost seems laughable in 2017. But this is not 2017, it is 1939 and the Nazi party are in power and growing eternally power crazed! They must control, dominate and manipulate all the citizens and the includes German women! \u201cWho will ever ask in three or five hundred years\u2019 time, whether a Fraulein muller or schuize was unhappy?\u201d Heinrich HimmlerHedwig and Lotti, are two young women, in the prime of their lives. At the faith and beauty society they learn music, tapestries and sketch landscapes. They make an oath to the Fuhrer pledging loyalty, sacrifice and achievement. It is when the body of Lotti is found savagely murdered, that Hedwig begins to question the Nazi ideals. Across Berlin, a young actress rubs shoulders with the Nazi Party\u2019s spouses. She moves amongst them with ease, almost as if she belongs to their clique. Her name is Clara Vine and Clara has secrets, secrets that could get her killed\u2026\u2026\u2026.Befriending the Nazi\u2019s spouses with their scheming ways and secrecy is never going to be an easy task. Clara excels at her role, making close friendships with Frau Hess, Emmy Goering and the insufferable Magda Goebbels. But why is Clara so interested in Goebbels and his propaganda?\u201cHistory is whatever Doktor Goebbels says it is\u201dAs the outbreak of war looms ever closer and there is speculation of a Russian/German alliance, tensions are frazzled, people scheme and violence escalates. The historical accuracy within this novel is absolutely outstanding! I have read lots of ww2 fiction throughout my life and this has to be one of the finest and neatest, I have ever read! The author manages to describe Berlin with such vivid paragraphs, that you almost feel as though you are there and watching the history take place around you. Obviously this makes for emotive reading, especially the descriptions of the Nazi atrocities. \u201cThe carpet of broken glass had spawned its own sinister, poetic coining, known the world over Kristallnacht The Night Of Broken Glass\u201d Within the novel the author really has brought to life the members of the Nazi party, their wives and family members also. Listening to their conversation and attitudes, is terrifying, yet spellbinding, all at the same time. Clara meets with an engages with a wide-variety of people, which adds so much depth to her story and characterisation. I can see her being many readers, favourite ww2 book character. When Clara meets Hedwig, she becomes caught up with the mystery of Lotti\u2019s murder. Who killed her and why? With war looming will they ever be caught? The faith and beauty society is the Nazi\u2019s way of bringing German women in line and conditioning the women to the Nazi Ideals. But essentially this is a story of 3 of those women, whom for various reasons, refuse to be controlled. I think the author has also created a very balanced novel, which fully shows how the Nazi\u2019s won power and the love of the German people. \u201cGermany is the first country in Europe to make laws to protect animals\u201d Whilst Hitler passes laws to protect animals, he also passes laws that sentence an entire demographic to death!Clara continues to ascertain as much information as she can gather. Whilst also attempting to help Hedwig uncover her friend\u2019s killer. But it is upon meeting Obersturmbannfuhrer Adler that her own Aryanization is called into question. Will Clara survive the war? Who can she trust to help her hide her secrets. \u201cTo be the subject of gossip was never a surprise in Nazi Germany. But a warning from the propaganda ministers wife was far more worrying\u201dThis is a definitive novel of secrets/lies and loyalty/dishonour in Nazi Germany! The historical accuracy is second to none and the plot keeps the reader gripped to the end!

I read it after finishing Woman in the Shadows (I read the first two out of order, because I had recieved the second one as a gift and wasn't initially aware it was the second). So perhaps if I had read thrse in order, it would make a little more sense, but I felt the plot of this one is far too similar to the other two. Clara, in this novel, has somehow become a more inept spy than in the previous two. I'm not sure how she gets worse over time, but here she needs a man to tell her that she's being followed. Insofar as the plot, in Woman in the Shadows, there is an incident at the Nazi Bridal School - a girl is killed, what's her secret, oh she was blackmailing someone. In this novel, a girl is killed at the Faith and Beauty school, oh she was blackmailing someone. The murder definitely is on the back burner in both books, but that is okay in Woman in the Shadows, because the book is interesting, the characters are interesting and we haven't seen this before: a murder in a Nazi school, Clara gets involved, there is a sketchy Nazi sympathizer who is or is not actually a sympathizer, Clara is attracted to him while still pining for Leo, the murder is not solved by German police because it may be an issue they're trying to cover up, but Clara solves it and takes care of the problem, although I did like the small twist of Hedwig killing the killer in this version. However, it is a tricky thing to make Hedwig, a Nazi sympathizer, suddenly not be one because of her boyfriend. Hedwig is actually a much more interesting character than Clara in this novel, but I think the ending would be more believable had she shown some disconnect with the Nazi philosophy earlier on. In fact, I kind of rooted for Hedwig when Jochen admitted he had used her: she is shown as a not terribly attractive girl, she is bookish, and she is now in love with a guy who has lied to and used her. It is so familiar to women and so insulting, I kind of wanted her to denounce him - at least it would have been more in keeping with her character- and at the dame time I was glad she didn't. I found her mostly sympathetic and was, therefore, glad to see her turn her back on Nazism - yet her change still feels too inconsistent and too easy. It is also part of the old annoying trope that women will give up their convictions and beliefs just so a man will love them. In this case, a woman giving up her convictions and beliefs is considered acceptable because her beliefs agree with Nazism, which is admirable to probably all of Thynne's readers, but which is also problematic in terms of both character and of straight women's relationships to men.Overall, this novel is too reminiscent of Woman in the Shadows, it seems to have dumbed Clara down, and the research, which was woven beautifully into the first two, felt overdone. The plots are too similar, the cast of characters too similar (the bigwig Nazi wives and Goebbels) and I would like to see something more in the next novel. Fewer Nazi officials or something. I did love the twist at the end about Angela. I still plan to read the next installment, and I still recommend the series, but I am not enthusiastic about this novel."}, {"userName": "Christina McLain", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22005745-christina-mclain", "userReview": "I have just finished # 4 in this series and there is a sameness to all of these books. They all begin with a young woman in peril, then they switch to the exploits of Clara Vine who is both an Anglo-German actress working in Berlin in its successful film industry in the 1930s and a secret spy for the British. What is interesting about these novels is the salacious, gossipy and probably accurate portrayal of the top Nazi brass and their spouses most of whom (no surprise) are horrible people...venomous, spiteful, antisemitic in the extreme and greedy greedy greedy for jewels, art works, glory and,of course,Hitler's favours. There are also hilarious scathing portraits of the British Mitford sisters who were heavily involved with Hitler and the pathetic Duke and Duchess of Windsor who hoped to get back on the British throne with the Fuhrer's help. The Fuhrer comes across as a creepy and curiously charismatic (again no surprise)madman. The other interesting aspect of this series is how the Nazis tried to force ordinary German women to stay make-up free, barefoot, pregnant (with the kids of the master race) and in the kitchen,through various social programs and institutions like schools for SS brides( no kidding) while the Nazi wives swanned around in Elizabeth Arden and Chanel.

This was really just a thrilling, enigmatic story that includes a murder, the threat of being caught spying, the threat of just anything the SS wanted to blame you for and also the underworld of the underground and how they work.I thought it humorous the jokes that everyone would make of some of the SS officers among the rankings. There was also a lot of name dropping going on as this also takes place on a movie set wherein Clara is an actress. \u2018For me, this was an exceptional read and definitely held my interest. This was a time when the world was in turmoil and I think the author did a great job portraying that in this story. I will have to say while some things were summarized at the end. There was a huge cliffhanger at the end. Will Clara and Leo be back?Huge thanks to Random House and Net Galley for providing me with a free e-galley in exchange for an honest review. I just loved, loved, loved this book. It was WONDERFUL, really took me back to those days."}, {"userName": "Fionna Guillaume", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47177444-fionna-guillaume", "userReview": "This was my first Clara Vine book, and it is so seamlessly done, I enjoyed it wholeheartedly despite not having more of her backstory. She is an engaging character, and I very much got to know her through this episode of her adventures.The best thing about this book is the way it portrays Berlin. In so many ways the city comes to life, from the luxurious palaces of Nazi elite to dour, working class neighborhoods, to the back rooms of tailor shops where Jewish seamstresses are hidden away. There is a sense of foreboding in everything people do and see. War is coming, though many continue to disbelieve it, and we see its dark tentacles spreading throughout as Europe prepares - once again - for the worst.I was enthralled by this story, particular the historical tidbits such as the Faith & Beauty society - a kind of finishing school for German girls hoping to marry into the higher echelons of Nazi society. How apt, yet how terrifying, that women were such an integral part of the 'new society' Hitler was trying to build. Yet for them - as for women the world over - being a supportive wife and housekeeper seemed to be the supreme goal. As well as maintaining beauty, poise, and elegant conversation. Not so different, really, from American debutantes at the time. And that is food for thought."}, {"userName": "Ashley Kress", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894134-ashley-kress", "userReview": "I received a galley copy of the novel through Goodreads Giveaways. It may seem strange, but I enjoy reading books about World War II, Nazi Germany, and the Holocaust. Yet, until this book, I had never been plunged into the depths of Nazi elite, to see how Germany operated from the inside. It startled and fascinated me. The description I had for the book stated that Clara entered the Faith and Beauty School as part of her investigation of Lottie's death, which is not true. Clara moves throughout the Nazi elite as a German actress and British spy. Much of her story does not focus on Lottie's death, but on her flittering around Europe as a spy. I really didn't like that she was willing to throw so much of her life away to learn anything about her ex-lover Leo's whereabouts. But, since this is an installment in a series, much more about Clara's character is hinted at through the chapters, giving way to more novels about her. I really enjoyed the story, but I was really waiting for Clara to do something exciting."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12829530-jessica", "userReview": "Germany is on the brink of war, and actress turned spy Clara Vine must decide if she will stay in Germany as it grows more dangerous, or return to England.She is shocked when Lottie Franke is murdered. Lottie was an aspiring costume designer who apprenticed at Clara's film studio, and a student at the prestigious Faith and Beauty school, which trains girls to one day be the wives of top Nazi members. Clara begins to find clues that Lottie's death could be tied to those in the highest ranks of the Reich.This is the fourth book in the Clara Vine series. There's not too much I can say about this one. I have the same issues with this one that I had with The Scent of Secrets: too much scene setting and unnecessary detail. This one, however, was also a lot slower. I was able to finish Scent of Secrets with some interest in the outcome, but I wasn't able to make it past the quarter mark in this one.

At a time when the world was preparing for war, whom can you trust? If you are of dual heritage, where do your sympathies lie? What will you do? Clara is faced with wanting to do the right thing by risking her life so that others may not know the horror of war, but at what cost to her? The telling of all the back-biting going on amongst the top ranking Nazis and their wives opened up that even those is power were unable to trust one another on their quest to world domination. This book weaves a story of many people and how their lives will become interconnected, leading up to the final pages. At times this story dragged a bit and that is what caused me to drop it one star, although I wish we could do halves.

What\u2019s annoying me is the author\u2019s obvious biases. In addition to her subtle digs toward librarians (without whom her historical research would be based on google) she continues to express an obvious distaste for any woman above a size zero. When one is writing historical fiction and one is calling historical women grotesque, massive, or hulking, one might ought to remember that one\u2019s readers can google photographs of the actual people.
