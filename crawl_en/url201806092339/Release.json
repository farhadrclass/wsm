That didn\u2019t make it any less true in those painful and euphoric days when it was happening. The truth was always now, even if you were young. Especially if you were young.\nI am so torn. I'm not even sure how I feel about Release overall. It's like there are two books in here - one I absolutely loved, and the other I just didn't enjoy at all.Ness is one of those authors who never writes the same book, or same kind of book, twice. Liking one is no guarantee you will like another. I absolutely adored his Chaos Walking trilogy - The Knife of Never Letting Go, The Ask and the Answer and Monsters of Men, I thought A Monster Calls was a beautiful middle grade book, and I loved what Ness did in More Than This. However, The Crane Wife didn't work for me, and I thought The Rest of Us Just Live Here was clever, but boring.Release is a strange story, heavily influenced by Mrs. Dalloway and Judy Blume's Forever. In fact, it's a little meta for my tastes (kind of like The Rest of Us Just Live Here was) and even includes direct references to Forever in the story, whilst the first and last lines are plays on the first and last lines of Mrs. Dalloway. When I said it felt like there were two books in one, that's because the story alternates between a day in the life of Adam Thorn, and a weird, kinda magical realism ghost story about a faun and a queen, which clearly had something to do with the recent death of a meth addict, but I'm still not 100% sure I get what the hell was going on.\nThe faun wishes to tell her, tell her that she is caught, his Queen, snagged and bound by a frightened soul. He needs to tell her that she is in danger of becoming lost forever, but he cannot. He can only look at the sun, less than an hour from its midday peak. The faun is worried. The faun is very worried.\nAdam Thorn's story, on the other hand, is very powerful. He is the gay son of a preacher, struggling against his family's beliefs, trying to ward off the sexual advances of his boss, and working through some serious heartbreak... all in the space of one day. The book manages to cover sex, love, friendship, family and loss in so few pages, and in such a moving way. Adam's chapters are hard-hitting, beautiful and sad. His ultimate realization towards the end of the book carries with it that certain bittersweetness that only comes with the letting go of someone you loved deeply.But I just didn't enjoy the experimental style of the other chapters. I'm sure it was supposed to be deep and meaningful, but the choice to add it felt cold and intellectual in a book that was otherwise so emotionally tense. I wanted more Adam, less weird.I would hesitate before recommending this book. Though Adam's story was compelling and his character so well-drawn, a lot of this short book is taken up with metaphoric wanderings into the weird and - sometimes it seemed - nonsensical. But maybe smarter people than me will appreciate it. Otherwise, I recommend reading Silvera's History Is All You Left Me instead.

I really enjoyed this read. It takes some important topics that are rarely discussed in YA, and in society in general. There were a few elements I didn't enjoy as much, but overall,  Release  is an important novel a wide variety of people should read.CW: homomisia (homophobia), sexual harassment, intimate partner violence Release  is a modern day contemporary yet there appears to be a supernatural/paranormal aspect as certain chapters follow the ghost of a recently deceased girl after rising out of the lake. I have to say, this was my least favorite part of the novel. The real-world storyline was fabulous, but the chapters from the ghost felt out of place. I wasn't a fan of the prose and didn't really understand why it was included. Clearly, it's meant to serve as some analogy or connection to Adam's story, but I can admit I may have just not read it critically enough. I've found similar issues for me personally in some of his other works, where I just do not \"get\" the slight paranormal elements included. Patrick Ness is such a strong contemporary writer but I can't ever seem to grasp the supernatural portions of his books. The \"ghost/queen/faun\" narrative was my biggest dislike about the book, otherwise, I really enjoyed the rest of it.I have to say, I am SO DAMN PLEASED with the portrayal of sexual harassment in this book. For one, sexual harassment against young boys is NEVER TALKED ABOUT and so often brushed off and hidden. I think this book could give a lot of comfort to boys who have been in similar situations as this topic is handled with care. But also,  Release  tackles Quid Pro Quo harassment (in the workplace; authority figure promises benefits and/or threatens consequences regarding sexual favors from an employee). I don't think I've ever read a young adult novel that discusses this form of harassment, which makes this book even more of a gem to me. This topic related to this population is so under-discussed and I really commend Ness for taking a stand and giving victims hope to fight through.Another wonderful piece of this book is Adam's struggle with his faith. I tend to have a soft spot for YA novels about teens distancing themselves from Christianity as it is something I have gone through myself. (I will say for my Christian followers, I feel Adam's questioning of his faith is done with respect to Christianity/Evangelism and his issues are not at all an attack on his belief system.) I know for a fact there are so many young LGBTQ+ teens out there who have grown up in religious households that create a hostile environment for them to be their true selves, and again, I believe  Release  can be a great comfort for individuals in that situation. I obviously can't speak for the representation but as Ness is a gay man (yay own voices!) I trust he's handled this topic with grace. Watching Adam's fears transform into defiance and confidence was truly elevating and I value my time watching him grow as a character.Overall, this was a super enjoyable read. It takes place over the course of one day and it is immensely easy to fly through. I always enjoy Ness's books and am especially glad this particular story exists for all the good I know it can do for readers. Would highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "\u201cThey're your parents. They're meant to love you because. Never in spite.\u201d3,5 StarsRelease was one of my most anticipated reads this year and one that I had preordered as soon as I had heard of it. Patrick Ness is one of the most taltented authors that I know. A Monster Calls was hauntingly beautiful and emotional while More Than This was eerie and scary as hell, but nevertheless beautiful. The Knife of Never Letting Go was brutal and twisted, too much so in my opinion, and The Rest of Us Just Live Here was just lacking in something.I'm afraid I have to say the same thing about Release. I expected a great contemporay novel. In a way it was: a wide range of likeable characters with depth, teen angst, coming of age characteristics, family issues, love and sex. What threw me off was the weird paranormal part of this book, a part that seemed almost trivial. It was very similar to The Rest of Us Just Live Here. We basically have to parallel plots that hardly ever overlap. The coexist but don't touch. It's two different stories in one book, and I'd rather have two standalone books than this strange mix-up. It would have worked much better that way. Maybe TROUJLH and Release are set in the same fictional world and have a connection that I fail to see.The thing is that Patrick Ness is an outstanding writer with so much potential! Why not focus on one storyline alone? I know both stories could have been fantastic in the way some of his previous books were.What I love about Release is the writing and especially the humour. There were a few laugh-out-loud moments and I enjoyed it through and through. I also want to thank him for being so open-minded about gay sex in YA novels. The sex scene(s) don't feel dirty or cringe-worthy in any way. He manages to go into detail without really going into detail. It's far from smut-fiction (which I am really glad about), simply normal, romantic, important, emotional and fun. The YA genre needs more of that.I can't wait to see what the future holds for Patrick Ness. He just announced that he will be writing the screenplay for the Chaos Walking movie starring Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland. I have high hopes for this adaption - and for his future novels.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"userName": "\u2744\ufe0fNani\u2744\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68538597-nani", "userReview": "first off, shout out to that beautiful cover, which, much to my embarrassment, didn't even take notice until I held the book in my hands. \ud83d\ude48I knew I was going to love Adam the moment I read the blurb and once I started reading it, all it took was the first page. Release is an emotionally deep and poignant story that takes place over the course of a single day\u2014 a day full of wonderful and awful surprises as it explores and discusses a multitude of themes in a stirring and compulsively readable way.\u2728 Adam:Adam lives in a deeply religious household, his father is an evangelical preacher and his brother\u2013the golden son\u2013is training to become an evangelical preacher. The day begins with Adam getting flowers for his mum (Americans are going, it's mOm!) then preparing for his ex-boyfriend's going-away party and as it goes on, we get a glimpse of his life, weighed down by his father\u2019s \u201cYoke\u201d, as he so calls it, until he can achieve the independence and freedom that he so longs for and a life without secrecy or shame. We experience, along with Adam, the revelations, heartbreaks and the decision to reshape his life in the defining day which Ness illuminates the intensity of his feelings with raw honesty and beauty. He is vulnerable and feels undeserving of love, he feels rejected by his parents for his gay identity, which they refuse to acknowledge, has a seemingly perfect older brother, can't break his attachment to his not-so-great ex Enzo and as a result can't fully commit to his current boyfriend Linus, his best friend Angela, on whom he relies for an outlet for everything has news of her own that\u2019ll throw him for a loop and to top it all off, he has to deal with his boss who sexually harasses him.As tense as it may seem for a book that takes place in a single day, Ness manages to perfectly form a smart and sensitive story that in no way feels overwhelming to read (except for heartache, you'll feel plenty of that), all the while interweaving a secondary plot thread which involves a supernatural event that unfolds in the same town, but has o connection to Adam\u2019s story in any manner nor does it enrich it.\u2728 Adam and parents:\u201cYou have no idea how hard I work to love you.\u201dAs for Adam's relationship with his parents, there\u2019s a phrase in the book, with which I\u2019ll end this particular section, where his father lands a gut-wrenching line after their heated argument, which sufficiently illustrates their difficult and incredibly complex relationship.It might be one of the saddest things I've read in a book.\u2728 Adam and BF Angela:One of the best parts of this book is the portrayal of Adam's friendship with Angela, a Korean adoptee, who not only is his emotional crutch but is pretty incredible herself. They\u2019re each other's confidant and support system who have nothing but genuine love and understanding for each other. There is so much depth and beauty to this friendship that I continually found myself looking forward to their scene together. \u2728 Secondary narrative:Alongside Adam\u2019s story is another paranormal narrative\u00a0that follows the ghost of a recently murdered girl which I found so utterly bizarre and detached from the main story.I read these sections chapter to chapter hoping to discover the link that finally interlocks both stories together and in a way, I supposed it did but I genuinely struggled with it and couldn't wait to get back to Adam's story. The book minus this particular part could've worked perfectly fine as it didn't add anything new or extra to the main storyline. Be it fantasy or contemporary, I always find Ness's characters so incredibly touching and easy to connect with in some ways or another and Adam was no exception.Apart from the secondary plot, Release is a beautiful, heartfelt novel that I'm so grateful to have finally read. The writing is beautiful and evocative yet not overly flowery where themes of sex, shame, acceptance and sexuality are explored in the most thoughtful way possible."}, {"userName": "Korrina  (OwlCrate)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37437502-korrina-owlcrate", "userReview": "Wow. Just wow. I read this book in just a few short hours, completely transfixed from the first page.

The core story is absolutely wonderful, thought-provoking and emotional, funny and sweet, and it reaffirmed why I am such a fan of Ness' writing. While I think I understood the point of the second story, I don't understand why it was necessary to tack it on here, so I guess I would have preferred some sort of explanation or connection between the two.Some may be so put off by the second story that it may detract from your enjoyment of the core story, and that's unfortunate, because there is so much heart and poetry to be found.One hell of a day is in store for Adam Thorn. His ex-boyfriend-of-sorts, Enzo, is leaving to move to Atlanta, and he still can't seem to shake his feelings for Enzo or completely process how and why their relationship ended. And although a new boy, Linus, is more than happy to take Enzo's place, and might possibly be in love with Adam, Adam is struggling with feelings of betrayal and low self-worth. He hopes everything will work its way out at Enzo's farewell \"get-together.\"Meanwhile, there is a crisis at home which roils his ultra-religious family. While Adam has gotten used to his parents' barely hidden disapproval of him (although he's never come out to them), it still hurts to see how easily they will forgive the missteps of his brother, who is following in the footsteps of their preacher father, but that they don't get him. But more and more, Adam knows that your chosen family is so much more important and cherished than the one you're born into.For Adam, that chosen family is his best friend, Angela, and her family. Adam and Angela have gotten each other since a near-death experience bonded them together as young children. Adam envies Angela's relationship with her free-spirited parents, while Angela is saddened for her friend's treatment at the hands of his family. She's willing to fight his battles for him or with him, and always has his back. But she, too, has a bombshell for Adam which threatens to rock their solid core.As if the day can't get any worse, things at his part-time job at the \"evil international mega-conglomerate\" come to a head because of his creepy, lecherous boss, Wade. When Wade gives Adam an ultimatum he really can't refuse despite the implications, it sets up multiple confrontations which put Adam on the short end of the stick. It's really enough to break anyone, much someone struggling as much as Adam is.Meanwhile, as Adam's life appears to be falling apart, a second story is occurring, one with a plot that is part fantasy, part supernatural (I think). In this story, which takes place at the same time and in some of the same places as Adam's story, a faun with mysterious powers must save his young queen from enacting her revenge, even if it means destruction for them both. There is some overlap to Adam's story (that eventually becomes clear), but I don't actually know if what takes place in the story really does happen in Adam's world.I'm trying to be somewhat vague, even with Adam's story, because it flows so beautifully as it unfolds. Nothing is necessarily earth-shattering or unique, but there's just so much love, pain, angst, and heart, I fell head over heels for the story. And while the other story is confusing, Ness is still a tremendously poetic guide, so I marveled at his language even as I found myself asking over and over, \"What does this have to do with the story?\"Ness knows how to tug at your heartstrings and how to make you laugh. The relationship between Adam and Angela felt so loving and genuine that it makes you wish you had a friendship like that (or perhaps inspires you to call that special friend and let them know how you feel about them). While Adam's situation is a little depressing at times, you know there are so many teenagers just like Adam struggling with these same issues. I know I struggled with some of them myself back before movable type was invented.One interesting thing, which may or may not put you off this book: Release is the first book I've read that actually has sex scenes between two gay teenagers. (They're of age, though, so relax.) They're not completely explicit but they're definitely more detailed than what you usually see in YA novels. So be warned if that makes you uncomfortable.Not everyone will love this book, because of that odd second plot. I totally understand that, but it's sad, because I think that at its core, Release is a book about finding the freedom you need to be yourself and live your own way, no matter who you are or how you choose to label yourself. It's also a book about love, both conditional and unconditional, whether it's among family, between friends, or in a romantic sense.While this isn't quite the home run I had hoped it would be, I still love the way Ness writes, and it will be a while before I can get this book out of my head. I still have to catch up on some of Ness' older books, too.

But it was actually very comprehensible and not out of the ordinary, if I don\u2019t take in account the random revengeful ghost. Having read neither Judy Bloom\u2019s \u2018\u2018Forever\u2019\u2019 nor Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u2018\u2018Mrs. Dalloway,\u2019\u2019 I had no idea what kind of beast \u2018\u2018Release\u2019\u2019 would turn out to be. If there are references to those two novels, I didn\u2019t get them. All I know is that there are two intertwined stories in this book\u2014a ghost\u2019s and a teenage gay boy\u2019s who is having the Worst Day Ever. I liked Adam just fine. I feel as though it\u2019s easier to connect with characters that show their flaws and vulnerable side to the reader, and Adam does that fairly often. His friends and foes\u2014and family\u2014are not so open. We know close to nothing about them. It\u2019s more about how they affect Adam and how Adam perceives them. We do not get their sides of the story. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not preferable, but this is a short enough novel and Adam is having the Worst Day Ever, so let\u2019s not ask too much of him. His entourage is about to leave him\u2014leaves Linus, whom he knows not what to do with. He\u2019s his boyfriend, but then again, is he really in love with him? So there are things Adam must figure out on this dreadful day.Patrick Ness surprised me. The story is mainly focused on Adam and his various relationships\u2014romantic, friendship and family-related. Since Adam is gay and his family is super-religious, this is a taboo subject in his family. But he, himself, is pretty comfortable with his way of life. In fact, the author discusses his sex life very openly, leaving little intimate details for the reader to figure out. That surprised me. It\u2019s a good thing, especially since the topics\u2014sex, masturbating, unrequited love\u2014discussed are relevant to teenagers and many YA authors do not go that far. I would definitely decapitate the ghost if given the chance, because she is irrelevant and only a distraction to the main story. What were you thinking, Patrick Ness? The characters didn\u2019t even care about the dead girl. She is mentioned maybe once or twice\u2014extremely briefly\u2014in total.

I\u2019m not sure whether Ness intentionally provided Adam with the broadest, most stereotypical representations of Evil - his sleazy, predator boss (complete with pedo-stache), and truly awful, bible-wielding family - and Good - his perfectly supportive, open-minded best friend\u2019s family and longsuffering angel boyfriend. Maybe it was a purposeful choice to make Adam himself seem more genuine in contrast; he is believably irritating and self-obsessed in the way most teenagers are. I find that between the near-caricaturization of the supporting players and the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink-stuffed-into-a-single-day plot (baby mama drama, workplace sexual assault, coming out, casting out demons, lots of sex, more than one friend moving away forever), Adam's story is done a disservice. Spoiler: There's a point near the end of the book in which Adam Triumphs over his Evil Father that, at the time of reading, is so exciting and fulfilling to witness because it would never happen in real life. The beauty of literature. Doesn't every 16-year-old fantasize about Righteously Defeating his Injudicious Parent by saying \"eff you, I'm running away and living at my best friend's house, try and stop me (insert raspberry),\" while slack-jawed Parent powerlessly stands by? A few minutes after reading, however, I couldn't help but think it selfishly contributes to the oversimplification of a legitimately painful situation. Not to mention the absurdity of Adam screaming about his boyfriend's lush pubes while his dad frantically tries to pray his gay away as they prepare for a baptism in dad's church.

Otherwise known as \"The Most Really Worst Day In The Possible Of Existence\". I felt so bad for Adam. Mate. This was so bad. And the fact that I could get this invested in characters and their lives and the complexity of everything and it's just ONE DAY is (A) proof of phenomenal writing, and (B) proof that I have a heart. Excellent. I had my doubts.ADAM IS PRECIOUS. He's very lost and he feels like he isn't loved. Well, actually worse: he feels like he doesn't deserve to be loved. My heart kind of broke for him, because, sure he doesn't have the \"worst life ever\" on the outside, but he has a highly religious family who believe being gay is a choice and a sin. And the boy he loved the most just broke his heart. And like the pain and heartache was so raw and palpable on the pages. He's not whingeing the whole time, but you can see pieces of him cracking as everything in his day goes from bad to actual hell.And yes it does have a lot of religion in it. But not like the preachy style. More like: This is Adam's family. THEY SUCK. And they are trying to love him in spite of him being gay and aguhrghuhgh no excuse me while I just get very distressed. Also there's an author's note that says the author actually based this story of his life growing up in a strictly religious family while being gay. You can absolutely feel the authenticity of Adam's emotions because of this. And like I don't think the book particularly hates ON religion. It criticises people who are hypocrites with how they show love. There's plenty of homophobia and it huuuurts.SMOL LIST OF THINGS TO LOVE:\u2022 Adam has the most epic best friend of Angela, who's Korean, and they love each other (platonically!!) to pieces.\u2022 there is pizza\u2022 it talks about the fact you CAN choose your own family\u2022 there are plenty of surprising twists\u2022 YOUR HEART MIGHT BREAK SEVERAL TIMES\u2022 there is a meaningful rose\u2022 death\u2022 relatable and interesting and complex teenagers who just felt SO REALOkay so the magical realism aspect? I didn't quite understand it. There's a dead girl who is a ghost and she goes looking for her killer...and I DON'T EVEN KNOW, DUDE. She finds a faun??? She starts to be a queen??? It was all very vague and metaphorical with flowery writing and ethereal tones. And like I APPRECIATED IT, but I actually didn't quite understand how it wrapped into Adam's story. Obviously it didn't dampen my enjoyment of the story to be a Clueless Avocado. (Ooh, my new nickname. I shall put that on my business cards.) BECAUSE FIVE STARS. ALL THE STARS. STARS FOR EVERYONE.ALL IN ALL: I absolutely loved this story. It was precious and raw and simultaneously heartbreaking and hopeful. And I seriously hope Adam has a better day after this book ends because seriously, talk about a day of craptasticness.

This book is a reminder that teenage love is still love, and your age doesn\u2019t discredit the depth of your feelings.The sense of openness and honesty. This whole book is such an open look at youth and love and sexuality, struggling against internalized homophobia, and trying to find your place in a world that feels too small at times. It took me a while to read this, mainly because a lot of it felt very personal to me.It's sad, but not overwhelmingly depressing. Release is a dark book. It made me cry multiple times, and Adam's situation is so desperate and heartbreaking at some points. Still, it manages to end on a lighter note, and emphasizes the goodness and love that he has found in life.The fantastic friendship between Adam and Angela. Angela was adopted from Korea by a Dutch mother and American father, and her family has become an incredibly important, loving presence in Adam's life. Adam and Angela have the absolute best kind of friendship\u2014one that goes so deep that you never have to question whether the other person will be there when you need them, they simply are. The kind where it feels like a literal part of you is pulled away from the whole when you realize your lives may be heading in separate directions.The discussion of labeling. Adam is gay, and his best friend Angela is questioning her own sexuality. Towards the beginning of the book they have a Really Good Talk about labels, and why they work for some people and not for others. For Angela, not using a label is a kind of freedom, but for Adam it\u2019s a really important way of understanding and expressing his own identity.\n\u201cWhen I realized how things were, when I said to myself that I am not this thing that I\u2019ve been told I have to be, that I am this other thing instead\u2026the label didn\u2019t feel like a prison, it felt like a whole new freaking map, and now I can take any journey I want to take and it\u2019s possible I might even find a home there. It\u2019s not a reduction. It\u2019s a key.\u201d\nI've read a lot of books lately that are really awesome about including (and discussing) labels, but I think this quote was probably one of the best ones I've found that sum up my own experience with self-identifying.Stuff I didn't like:The weird parallel ghost story. I was just.......confused, more than anything else. The writing in those chapters was so dense and convoluted, and I genuinely could not make any sense of the plot. It's been a week and a half since I read it at this point.........I remember something about a faun? and a queen? and a possessed dead girl who was murdered?? I feel like I'm making it sound much cooler than it was, so let me make this clear: it was a bizarre, jumbled mess. I ended up skimming most a lot of those chapters, and from what I could tell they were really only tangentially related to Adam's story.Something else to note: this book comes with a MASSIVE trigger warning for homophobia and sexual harassment. There were some scenes between Adam and his father that were incredibly sad and painful to read. (To be completely honest I kinda skimmed past most of the side plot chapters, but I think there may be triggers for drug use in there, too.)Despite my mixed feelings, I still recommend this. Maybe you'll like the paranormal shit, but even if you don't I still think Adam's story is worth the read.I received an ARC from the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7232880-simon", "userReview": "Patrick Ness has written what I think could be one of the most important YA fiction novels yet.

In your life you always have this one friend you can talk about anything and everything with . . . that's who Adam and Angela are for each other, this very special friend. They have each other's back, they don't feel the need to judge what the other does . . . they've been friends for so long they don't even need the other to say it out loud when something is wrong, they just know.\u201cI don't know why you're lying to me.\u201d She took his hand and held it, just like that day they'd turned over in the car. \u201cBut maybe that's what you have to do to stay alive right now, so that's okay. If you ever fall, I'm here to catch you. Or not, actually, you're a giant, but I'm here to at least watch you fall and then get bandages.\u201d\n#H E A R T B R E A K\nAdam's heart is broken. Broken by his first love and by his family. It's just broken and it won't heal, no matter what he does. And the thing is, he doesn't even know why it's still broken.Adam was in relationship with a guy once - stupid asshole - who made him feel like the most amazing and beautiful person in the world . . . just before crushing him and making him feel worthless. I don't think you can call this an abusive relationship, but it wasn't healthy. Enzo kept on taking and taking and taking without ever giving. He didn't care about what it was like to be Adam. He told Adam he loved him and then he took it back. He took it all back. Made him feel unloved. Even when Adam is in a relationship with amazing Linus - my precious savage son - he's still heartbroken and afraid.But then Linus noticed the tears squeezing out of Adam's eyes on either side and, with gentleness, brushed them away. \u201cAdam?\u201d\u201cPlease don't leave me unloved,\u201d Adam answered and cried some more, ashamed.Then we have Adam being heartbroken over his family . . . his family who just won't accept him the way he is . . . a family who truly thinks that praying will \u2018heal\u2019 their son of his gayness, a family who scared this son away. You're supposed to love your child unconditionally, no matter what . . . you're not supposed to make him feel unloved.\u201cDo you love me?\u201d Adam asked.\u201cMore than my own life,\u201d his dad said, immediately.\u201cBut you don't want to have to do anything with that love. You don't want it to have to work.\u201d\u201cYou have no idea how much I work to love you.\u201dAnd there it was, the blow after all.Last thing. When your son comes to you and say his boss is sexually harassing him, don't say he asked for it. Never. How could you do that to your own son?\u201cMaking myself available?\u201d he said, feeling the fury rise. \u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201dHis dad looked up sharply, angrily. \u201cDo not use language like that in God's House.\u201d\u201cBut it's okay to accuse your son of leading his manager into sexual harassment bordering on outright assault?\u201d\u201cI'm just saying, maybe unconsciously-\u201d\u201cI'm seventeen. He's my gross boss with a gross moustache and looks like a road so well travelled I need to wash my hands after just being near him.\u201d\u201cYou let him put his hands on your thighs.\u201dThis landed like a slap. The words of blame he had put on his own self, now coming out of the mouth of his father.\u201cSo I was asking for it,\u201d Adam said, his mouth dry. \u201cIs that what you're saying?\u201d\n#B R O T H E R H O O D\nI wasn't the biggest fan of Marty at first, but I knew he wasn't truly bad. He said some stupid shit he learned from his dad, but that wasn't him speaking, it never was him. And when he finally realized he had to think for himself, I wanted to hug him and say something like \"You go Glen Coco\" just because I felt like it.\u201cI've committed my life to this. I'm not perfect, bro, far from it, but I know that love can be perfect. I just . . . I want you to know that I know I've been doing what they've been doing. For too long. I've put conditions on you. I've looked at you with pity.\u201d\u201cI know. It's been a carnival of delights.\u201d\u201cAnd I'm sorry for it, Adam. I can't say sorry enough. But my world isn't safe if I can't love my own brother. That's what it really felt like today. And that's not a world I can live in. So I love you, Adam. And whatever help you need from me to fix all this with Mom and Dad . . . Well, you go it.\u201d\n#A C C E P T A N C E\nAt some point, enough is enough. You can't be treated like shit all your life. You can't pretend everything is okay when it's not. You can't look like you're happy when you're definitely not.At some point you have to move on, you have to let go. You have to admit what you once had is gone. You have to do what's good for you.\u201cI hoped and hoped and hoped. For a year and a half. And then he dumped me. For the worst, stupidest reasons. And I guess . . . I guess I still hoped. Even when I knew I shouldn't. Even when I had better things right in front of me.\u201d He looked over at Linus. \u201cHe was the first way out for me. The first way out of all the rest of this stuff that races and races. The first window to a world that could be, a world I'm kind of desperate for. And he had my heart, I admit that.\u201d\n#B L O O D D O E S N T M E A N F A M I L Y\nWhen Adam finally saw how toxic his parents were, when he realized he had people waiting for him to ask for help . . . that's when he understood his parents weren't his real family. Because you create your family with people who deeply love you no matter what. People who won't think less of you for who you are.\u201cAnd I'm going from here to meet Angela. And I'm going to the party with her. And I'm not going to stop seeing my boyfriend.\u201d\u201cYes, you are.\u201dAnd here, Adam did something he couldn't ever remember doing. He stepped towards his father, as a physical challenge, a show of the bravery his anger was making him feel but which he knew would run out fast.His father, astonished, stepped back.\u201cDo you know why I'm going to do all those things?\u201d Adam said. \u201cBecause they're my family. They love me. They are who I go to when things are hard. That hasn't been you for years, Dad, and do you really never wonder whose fault is that?\u201d\u201cI am your father-\u201d\u201cA father with conditions. I have to be a certain way to be your son.\u201d\u201cThrough prayer, everything is possible-\u201d\u201cI don't know, I've prayed for years to change your heart. Nothing's happened so far.\u201d//Also I would like to quickly mention the side story . . . at first I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but thought out the book I saw how much sense it made. This story just had to be here. And I really ended up liking it!//This book made me cry. I found myself so much in Adam, and I just wanted to hug and protect him.

Aqu\u00ed nos encontramos con la historia del peor d\u00eda de la vida de Adam Thorne. Adam es un chico gay que, desafortunadamente, ha crecido en medio de una familia ultra religiosa y que, por supuesto, finge demencia con respecto a lo que su hijo es. El peor d\u00eda de la vida de Adam empieza con malas noticias sobre la partida de la ciudad de su exnovio, cambios dr\u00e1sticos de planes con su mejor amiga Angela, situaciones de acoso en su trabajo y crisis amorosas con el chico con el que est\u00e1 saliendo ahora. Hasta ese punto la historia es maravillosa, pero todo empieza a revolverse cuando en medio de cada cap\u00edtulo narrado por Adam encontramos otra historia paralela en la que el realismo m\u00e1gico envuelve todo. En ella se mezclan el esp\u00edritu de una chica asesinada, una Reina misteriosa, un fauno y voces del bosque que no entendemos sino hasta el cap\u00edtulo final de Release.En s\u00ed mismos, los cap\u00edtulos que narra Adam de ese d\u00eda en el que todo su mundo se est\u00e1 derrumbando son maravillosos. Patrick Ness plasma la angustia adolescente que un chico puede sentir con respecto a su identidad sexual, la represi\u00f3n de no poder mostrarse tal como es en un pueblo peque\u00f1o y de miras estrechas, la incertidumbre de dejar ir a un primer amor y concentrarse completamente en las personas del presente que lo quieren m\u00e1s que a nada en el mundo y, sobre todo, el miedo de que tu mundo como lo conoces cambie de la noche a la ma\u00f1ana. Hay un punto del libro en el que Adam reflexiona sobre lo f\u00e1cil que es dejarse amar por cualquiera, as\u00ed no sea suficiente para ti, que vivir por completo en ese punto llamado soledad. As\u00ed mismo, Patrick Ness va soltando peque\u00f1as situaciones que nos hacen pensar sobre el supuesto amor incondicional de los padres, la injusticia de los prejuicios y el constante vivir de apariencias cuando todo el mundo te dice que lo que eres est\u00e1 mal. Si bien el personaje principal de Release es Adam, la historia se fortalece much\u00edsimo gracias a Angela, su mejor amiga y apoyo incondicional, y a Linus, su pareja actual. Angela demuestra que, muchas veces, podemos contar m\u00e1s con nuestros amigos que incluso con nuestra propia familia. Y muestra, adem\u00e1s, que los verdaderos amigos no te juzgan por absolutamente nada y que est\u00e1n all\u00ed para decirte lo tonto que est\u00e1s siendo cuando tienes una oportunidad frente a ti y no la est\u00e1s tomando. Linus, por otra parte, es el chico m\u00e1s amable y comprensivo con el que te podr\u00edas topar. \u00c9l es justo la persona paciente y atenta que Adam necesita en este punto \u00e1lgido de la vida y, gracias a \u00e9l, Patrick Ness hace que entendamos que el amor no tiene por qu\u00e9 ser una jaula ni una c\u00e1mara de seguridad que te vigile todo el d\u00eda; al contrario, el amor debe ser aquello en lo que est\u00e1 all\u00ed para ti en los mejores y peores momentos. No es algo que te enjaula, es algo que te libera. Con respecto a la historia paralela extra\u00f1a, poco me queda por decir m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de que hizo que me aburriera tremendamente cuando llegaba a esos cap\u00edtulos porque eran tan disconexos que sent\u00eda que estaba leyendo dos libros diferentes. En mi opini\u00f3n, Release hubiera sido un libro de 4, incluso 5, estrellas si se hubiera omitido ese experimento extra\u00f1o."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah", "userReview": "3.5 stars. This book was like two stories in one. At first, it seemed to me like the stories weren't really connected at all and the change from one story to the other felt like a disconnect. I felt that disconnect between the two right up until that amazing ending where the two stories overlapped in such a wonderful way. I appreciate a great ending and that ending was so so fantastically beautiful, I loved it. I sort of wish the two stories would have been more interconnected throughout but then I know that that ending wouldn't have been so amazing if they were. For a very long time, I only liked Adam's story. I found the ghost story to be sort of confusing but then towards the end, I started to like it. I also thought the writing in the ghost chapters wasn't as enjoyable as the writing in Adam's chapters. Something that was absolutely fabulous was the openness that Adam and Angela had. There was no holding back at all, especially when it came to talking about sex and relationships. Sometimes YA books hold back when it comes to talking about sex but this book was like a breath of fresh air. Their friendship was awesome. It felt authentic and special and I loved it. The romance was also so sweet. I would recommend this. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\"It was so much easier to be loved than to have to do any of the desperate work of loving.\"\"the pain is so distant as to be in another room.\"\"His chest burned, so much he couldn't tell where the anger stopped and the wound began.

Now that may not be something different, but these two stories are set in different worlds (sort of). The real world, and the spirit world.We meet Adam, a young, gay man trying to just be himself and live his life, but he has the added upset of people not understanding his sexuality, including his religious parents. He also has serious problems with his boss making advances towards him, and an ex which he can\u2019t seem to let go of, even-though he has a boyfriend, Linus, and his ex Enzo is dating someone else.He has the most wonderful best friend Angela, but he doesn\u2019t know how to be comfortable in himself, when others aren\u2019t comfortable or accepting towards him.In the spirit world we meet a murdered, teenage drug addict, who has come out of the river and wants vengeance on her killer in the small town.By the time I had turned the last page I realised that I had found a book that quite a few people will be able to relate to. Adam\u2019s story is told so vividly that sometimes it felt like I was in the story, not reading it. It makes you stop and think; hopefully books like this will make people realise that everybody has the right to be whoever they want to be, gay, straight, bi, etc, and no-one has the right to be judgemental about it.The book is completely unusual and strange, plus a little confusing in parts. I haven\u2019t read any of Patrick Ness\u2019s work before, but apparently that is his style of writing, moving away from the conventional \u2013 I like it.A poignant story, with a wonderful plot.

Just Ness things.Thoughts upon finishing Release:Well...shit, I love Ness, but even I'll join the masses and say what the hell did I just read?That's not fair. The A-Plot in the contemporary story (re: Adam Thorn exploring his sexuality while combating his religious family, confusing relationships, and his drive for a better future for himself) is spectacular. If I were to review Release on that narrative thread alone, it would surely be in the 4's/5. Truly. Call me biased but Ness always seems to write nuanced relationships -- be it friend, family, or found family's -- that oozes with voice and presence that make the stories of the sub characters as important as the protagonists themselves. That is something.But. (And that's a hefty but.)The B-Plot in this story is...what...huh?Let me first say that I am unfamiliar with the Mrs. Dalloway plot. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I knew what that story was about, but part of me wonders if that's the fault of the reader (me) for not fully appreciating the weirdness or if it was just presented in an unsatisfactory way. Who can know?So...this B-Plot. The revelation by the end was somewhat rewarding, but that might have just been my skewed understanding and takeaway from the Queen/Faun plot line more than its leniency towards Dalloway in general. My take on Release, as it so often is wrong, is that if the experience and sensation of feeling 'release' is the ideal state of betterment in any situation, then we, as readers, do not necessarily have to look toward fantastical \"fictional\" stories to find comfort and self-actualization for our own livelihood. That finding release in the real world by way of the A-Plot (Adam Thorne) is equally beautiful and heartbreaking and worthwhile as it is to live and learn it vicariously through a B-Plot (Queen/Faun Fantasy).This is all to say everyone falls, but it's how we manage ourselves in spite of it that matters. And yeah we could have something teach us that (which is completely fine) but if we learn that on our own, that's great in its own way too.Does that make sense? Probably not.

The front story tells a heartbreakingly realistic picture of teenage love, parental relations, friendship and more. Ness doesn\u2019t shy away from serious issues and showcases these characters with brutal honesty. I found the story eerily relatable, and I suspect many others will as well.The side story is a weird symbolic fantasy that reminded me of Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood and his Land Of Make Believe. Through veiled parallels, we see a fantastic charade of the main plot. Most of the time I thought this side story was a ridiculous waste of time, but in other moments it was a pleasant escape from the real world and put a kind of galactic context to life crisis moments. In that aspect it works.Overall, expertly written and entertaining even as it is heartbreaking at times. Also an honorable attempt at bringing Mrs Dalloway to a younger audience.

I feel like I'm going to have a hard time describing this book. It was like it had two different stories going on simultaneously. I think I need to think about this one a little bit more before writing a full review.--What I LikedA Day In The Life. Release tells the story of Adam Thorn and it all takes place during a single day in his life. Honestly, so much happens to this kid within one day it was almost hard to believe that this story took place within a day. Then I started to remember all of the days where it felt like it couldn\u2019t get any worse\u2026and it did. Release did a great job of telling the reader a story about a kid who is getting hit with everything all at once.Simultaneous storytelling. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about this aspect of the story at first, but after thinking about it for a bit, I really like this idea. It was cool to see two very different stories being told at once. I thought that maybe they would intertwine, which they kind of did, but not to the extent that I thought that they would. I actually really liked the subtly of it. The two stories didn\u2019t really meet until the very end of the novel, and while I definitely wanted to know more, I\u2019m okay with the kind of open ending that we got.The strangeness of it all. As you can probably tell, Release was slightly on the stranger side. Two very different stories being told at once was already a pretty quirky take on storytelling, but it was also the content of the second story that was on the stranger side. It was almost paranormal/urban fantasy/magical realism in nature? I honestly don\u2019t even know how to describe it, but I can tell you that I loved how unique it was! Also, anyone who knows me knows that I love all things weird/quirky/dark & strange! Classic coming of age. Somehow, mixed into all the weird, there was a classic coming of age story being told. We meet a boy who has recently begun a new relationship after his old one fell apart, all while he\u2019s trying to figure out if he still has feelings for the first boy, or if he is ready to move on with this new boy. All while something strange and dark is happening in the town around them. It all sounds a little out there, I know, but it really did work!--What I Didn\u2019t LikeSlightly out there. I keep praising the strangeness of this novel, but at times it did confuse me. I guess it was just my natural need to understand what the heck was going on. It took me until the end of the novel to accept that I wasn\u2019t going to get all the answers that I wanted and that it was okay.--Overall, this book was definitely a strange one, but it was the kind of strange that I absolutely love. The kind that makes you think. I really enjoyed this novel, just like I\u2019ve enjoyed everything else I\u2019ve ever read by Patrick Ness.

The violence they do themselves.\n\u201cThe violence we do ourselves,\u201d she whispers.An anger rises. She pushes the door, sudden, fast, so hard it falls off its hinges. She storms in, her bare feet raising burn marks on the floor, whiffs of smoke vanishing as she steps. \u201cYou are here! You are here! You would do this to me?\u201d\nShe stops in the middle of the room. She is alone, wonders why she thought she wasn\u2019t.But it was the past, of course.\nWhere?? does it make any sense?? I read this page about five times but I\u2019m still at a loss to what it meant.It\u2019s definitely not Patrick Ness\u2019 best work: but even then, it has bits that made me scream #relatable.\n(x)\nShe thinks, feels, reaches out, and knowing exactly what blame is \u2014 a human construct, one of its blackest and most selfish and self-binding \u2014 she can find further strands of it, emanating in all directions, for blame is something that is shared but denied in equal measure.\n\nQueer book #2 of pride month"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7810503-michael", "userReview": "Oh wow, Patrick Ness.I don't quite know what to say. This book dealt with the messiness that life can be, with self worth, with love, with religion, with friendship, with the concept of family, with spirits, and with so much more.It was weird and emotional and powerful and I loved it."}], "description": "Adam Thorn doesn\u2019t know it yet, but today will change his life.Between his religious family, a deeply unpleasant ultimatum from his boss, and his own unrequited love for his sort-of ex, Enzo, it seems as though Adam\u2019s life is falling apart.\u00a0 At least he has two people to keep him sane: his new boyfriend (he does love Linus, doesn\u2019t he?) and his best friend, Angela.But all day long, old memories and new heartaches come crashing together, throwing Adam\u2019s life into chaos.
