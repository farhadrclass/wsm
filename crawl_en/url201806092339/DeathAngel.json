I realize it is an older book but if you haven\u2019t read it, you can probably get it at a bargain.The Warner's are leading what many would call the perfect life, until-----Kate is waiting for their daughter to get off the school bus but is distracted by a phone call. When she looks for her child she is no where to be found, how could she have disappeared so soon. She calls the police and tries to get in touch with her husband; unfortunately her husband has shut off his cell phone.A search for the child proves fruitless and things turn ugly when the police chief fingers the husband as a strong suspect, especially since he cannot verify his whereabouts at the time of the abduction. The abduction turns to murder when the little girl is found raped and murdered in the woods.The husband is a suspect but then again there are three of four more possibilities. The case turns cold and Kate finds herself trying to clear her husband and find the real killer.There are many surprises in this book and will satisfy all readers of the psychological mystery/thriller."}, {"userName": "Patricia McCabe", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44245572-patricia-mccabe", "userReview": "Oh my! Literally from beginning to end of this book I was going back and forth between the characters trying to figure out who the killer was. Once I thought I'd had it figured out, my guess would change to someone else. When I thought for sure it was them, my mind jumped to someone else. The ending!!! Perfect!! I could not put this book down! So glad I randomly chose this book from the library shelf with no prior knowledge of the story other than reading the title, selecting it off the shelf and going!!"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1772178-carol", "userReview": "Good beginning and I was very intrigued but it took WAY too long to get to the conclusion. The action at the end became predictable, unrealistic and thus, annoying."}, {"userName": "Lillie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1462477-lillie", "userReview": "A real puzzling mystery with a surprise ending. Fast-paced and filled with emotion. The only problem was that there were no scene breaks when the story shifted from one location and set of characters to a completely different place with different characters. The scene breaks may have been lost in conversion to Kindle. I don't know if the same problem exists in other formats."}, {"userName": "Kristy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5986942-kristy", "userReview": "I feel let down by this one"}, {"userName": "Lori Schiele", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5618256-lori-schiele", "userReview": "An 8-year-old girl disappears somewhere between getting off the school bus and reaching home (less than a block). The small, peaceful community is shocked and frightened--even the Chief of Police, since violence, murders and drugs were what made him leave Chicago in the first place. The little girl is found a few days later, beaten, raped and dead at a Nature Reserve. Now, everyone is a suspect, including the parents, particularly the father who had a very shaky alibi during the \"window of death\" provided by the ME. As the news crews hound their house, hoping for a new clip, a sound bite--anything... the police have the despondent parents looking over film footage and photographs taken at the wake and the cemetery, hoping to find someone who doesn't belong there (since many killers like this often enjoy seeing their \"handiwork\") Then, the police turn to investigating the father and are just about to arrest him, when he, too, disappears and a search discovers his car, clothing, wallet, and keys at the beach of Lake Michigan. There is no body, and after a 48 hr search, they determine that he, too, is most likely dead. Their theories being that he knew he was going to be arrested and he took his own life, which his wife refuses to believe at all: that he could ever hurt (let alone rape and murder) their daughter or commit suicide by drowning because he was afraid of the water. Still... the police are willing to let sleeping dogs lie and believe they have found the killer.  The mother ignores the police's warnings and continues to snoop around. When she is finally approached by an old family friend, a doctor at the local hospital, who was also Godfather to the daughter, who has helped them through the thick and thin of this tragedy, offers the use of his cabin on the lake away from the noise and the questions and the sympathetic crooning that are intermixed with the cruel words spewed toward her about how her husband had been a monster... She accepts, all the while knowing the real killer is still out there. Perhaps much closer than she ever realizes.It was a good book, a little dry in spots. Definitely not a \"fast read\" but still worth reading. I was not surprised by the identity of the murderer, even though the author seemed to leave bread trails leading in different directions. But in my reading, I suppose the birds ate all of the bread and left me only one trail because I was acutely aware of the murderer halfway through the book. I just wasn't sure how things would end. While not a dynamite read, it was well done."}, {"userName": "Mona Hansen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40992285-mona-hansen", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this mystery with a twist.

The lead character was annoying the hell out of me. Her hubby is accused of a big crime and he lies to her and is pretty evasive and she came across as a bit of a fool for believing anything he said and I lost patience with her !! She may well have rightfully trusted him, I don't know, but she came across as weak and daft to me.I enjoyed the first part of the story but I got to 48% in and gave up.I did spot some apostrophe errors and in one place States should have had a capital letter and a couple of times words were misused such as \"wakened her when he got up\" when it should read he got back.I have another by her downloaded and will try that.

Although it is based on a tragic event, the book leads you through all the emotions of the affected family, as well as all the police investigation, so you can try to figure out who the \"bad guy\" is.
