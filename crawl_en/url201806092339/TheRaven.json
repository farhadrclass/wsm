Shall we be haunted by our own desires? Shall we be consumed by that terrible facet of life known only as death? Shall we cling to what cannot be reanimated? Shall we wish for a return of something that has long been in darkness? Shall we become obliterated by the brutal finality of such a statement as \u201cnevermore?\u201d Lenore has gone. She has departed from this life, and is permanently out of the reach of the man. The raven represents the solidarity of this. Despite how much he longs for the impossible, despite how much he hopes for something that could never occur, he still has that inclination that the fantastical could happen: he has to believe that she could come back. And the raven represents the voice of reason, the voice of actuality. And it kills him. It is pain, despair, melancholy and a spiritual death all rolled into one haunting feathery package. He rebels against this voice of rationality. He knows the voice speaks the truth, but he cannot simply accept it. He has lost something vital; he has lost part of himself that will never grace his presence again. And he clings to hope, a false hope such as it is. The raven smashes this to oblivion; it destroys any last semblance of the miraculous occurring. It makes the man realise that this is life, not some whimsical world where nothing bad ever happens. People die. People we love die. Nothing can change that. Lenore will never walk through his chamber door again, and the reality drives him into madness. It shatters his life. \u201dAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor  Shall be lifted- nevermore!\u201dHis soul will never lift anymore; hope shall never be lifted anymore. By the end of the poem he has full realised the reality of the situation. The raven, the dark bird of harsh truth, the harbinger of the words he simply doesn\u2019t want to hear, has become demonised. It has become the very object he did not want to face; he created a sense of longing to protect himself from the emotional loss of Lenore, and this bubble of falsehood has been burst. Reality sets in, and it is a fate worse than death. It is one of persecution and mental chaos as the bird is simply unable to supply the man with all his answers. He is driven mad by the unknown. The man in the poem has lost \u201cLenore.\u201d But, what is this Lenore? Is she a woman? Is she this man\u2019s lost love? Or is she something much, much, more? I think on the surface level of the poem she is his dead wife. But the archaic references speak of something else. Lenore could perhaps be a universal suggestion of a lost sense of self or even humanity. We are no longer what we once were. It is also rather significant that the man is persecuted only by the natural world. Very much in the Romanticism vein, man stands aside from nature. He has become something different with his modernisation and industrialisation. He walks outside his nature. And Poe, being an anti-transcendentalism thinker (a dark romantic), demonstrates that life isn\u2019t all sunshine and roses, and nor could it ever be. It is pessimism in full force, and although I strongly disagree with the outlook on life, and appreciate the idealistic utopia offered in the poetry of Percy Shelley and other Romantics much more, I do love the dark beauty of this poem. The finality of the phrase \u201cnevermore\u201d is nothing short of maddening reality for our lost man. It is the end of hope. This is quite easily one of Poe's finest works, and I highly recommend listening to this version of the poem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Befli...

This is probably the best poem in history ever to have sold for $9. But what is it about? That's a more difficult question. The poem has undeniable power, but its power (as in much of Poe) is not entirely susceptible of rational explication. First, there's the sheer liturgical music of the poem, as evidenced from the very opening lines:\"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.''Tis some visiter,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door-- Only this and nothing more.'\"We've technically got 8-syllable troches here (trochaic octometer?), with the stress on the first syllable of each line, but the real genius is how the rhymes weave in and out of the lines, with the rhymes not just happening at the end of each line but also in between (dreary / weary; napping / tapping). As a reader, you get so caught up in the sing-song rhymes that what exactly is happening seems secondary, and the fact that it's often opaque seems irrelevant to its linguistic power. Or perhaps it heightens its power in the same way as the Latin Mass, through the sheer rhythmic beauty of the sounds themselves.Because really almost nothing is explained here--who's Lenore? What's the raven doing? Was there another visitor at the door? What does \"nevermore\" mean? No, as in much of Poe, what's transcendent here is the feeling, the emotion, of dread, loss, and the slow descent into madness, until at the end, \"the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\" about his door, \"And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor / Shall be lifted--nevermore!\""}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "First... you must read the introductory stanza from Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem, The Raven. And then I'll provide a short review:Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore\u2014  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \u201c\u2019Tis some visitor,\u201d I muttered, \u201ctapping at my chamber door\u2014  Only this and nothing more.\u201d And this is what will happen to you once you read it:Yeah, I probably should have told you that part first, huh? But that's the thing about Mr. Poe. He enjoyed the fact that his writing drove him crazy. And all of us. That tapping... non-stop... reminds you of his other work, The Tell-Tale Heart.This raven and its real or imaginary appearance is such a powerful image. And here's the thing about this poem... you need to have a professional read this poem aloud, perhaps with a little music in the background. Just a little bit, as the words in the poem... the rhymes, the images... it's ghastly. And if the speaker is as brilliant as Poe, (s)he will alter their voice as each line erupts, enticing the rhythm and the beat. And when it happens, the fear will surround you. The words will penetrate you as your eyes ears lay still, absorbing the melody and the lyrics.It may sound funny, but find a recording of it. Listen to it in a semi-dark room. And just let the poem attack your mind and body. I believe it's what inspired the boat ride in the Willy Wonka movie... only much darker.

Every time I hear mention of them I shudder. I mean, come on. Have you ever heard one croak? Second question; have you ever heard a tree full of them croak? I have. There I was, minding my own business, just trying to walk home from the bus stop. I didn\u2019t even see them until I was directly beneath the tree. I heard this strange rustling sound and thought it was weird because the leaves had already fallen. Naturally, I paused to look up. What was I met with?  Okay, maybe it wasn\u2019t that dramatic but I was eleven and they were just up there\u2026looking at me\u2026with their beady little eyes\u2026and their stabby little beaks. Then one opened its mouth and croaked. Then another joined in. Then another. I ran the rest of the way home. I was convinced that it was some kind of omen and I was going to die within 24 hours. My mom didn\u2019t buy it. That heartless woman made me go to school. I spent the next day acting like some kind of little schizo, jumping at noises, slinking down hallways, screaming whenever a loud noise went off. What? I had an overactive imagination as a kid. Ravens still creep me out. Crows too. They hang out in groups called murders. They\u2019re far too intelligent for comfort. It\u2019s in the eyes, in the way they just\u2026stare at you. *shudder* Did you know that they can count to five? One species even makes its own tools. And another\u2026sorry, I\u2019m getting off topic. I avoided reading this poem until I was in my twenties. I\u2019d read all of his other works before I sucked it up and attempted this. It gave me nightmares. I suggest never reading Poe\u2019s thoughts on this poem. It takes the magic away. His approach to writing it was too clinical, too structured. I like to ignore what he said about his method and picture him gaunt and disheveled, crouched over a piece of parchment and scribbling away like a madman. I\u2019ll leave you with my favorite passage: \n\u201cAnd the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sittingOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon that is dreaming,And the lamp-light o\u2019er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floorShall be lifted \u2013 nevermore!\u201d\nThis review can also be found at The Book Eaters."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "Once upon a midnight dreary,while I pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volumeof forgotten lore,While I nodded, nearly napping,suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping,rapping at my chamber door.\"'Tis some visiter,\" I muttered,\"tapping at my chamber door --Only this, and nothing more.\"I had started reading the Raven before but was never able to quite get through it.

First published in January 1845, the poem is often noted for its musicality, stylized language, and supernatural atmosphere. It tells of a talking raven's mysterious visit to a distraught lover, tracing the man's slow fall into madness. The lover, often identified as being a student, is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore. Sitting on a bust of Pallas, the raven seems to further instigate his distress with its constant repetition of the word \"Nevermore\".

It was published in 1845. It consists of eighteen stanzas. This is one of Poe\u2019s best-known poems along with The Bells, and Annabel Lee. The poem introduces a narrator who mourns for his lover\u2019s death. Someone seems at the door rapping and tapping without stopping. The narrator tries to figure out who is at the door. However, he finds no one there. Suddenly a raven flutters into the chamber. It perches on a bust. The narrator considers the raven as a prophet and starts to ask it questions. The only answer, which the raven utters, is \u2018nevermore\u2019.Poe was inspired by Charles Dickens\u2019 pet, which was a raven too. It was also inspired by other literary sources. The poem puts the narrator in a state that cannot be avoided. The narrator is lost\u2014he wants to remember his lover\u2014but he pines for forgetting her. The raven is but a darker intruder\u2014it is a harbinger of death\u2014and possibly evil. There are also other elements in the poem, which implicate dark magic\u2014and this what reinforces the intrusion of the raven. When Poe wrote this poem and had it published, his wife Virginia was suffering from tuberculosis\u2014and her death was certain. Lenore could be expressing what Poe\u2019s wife expressed\u2014as it could relate to Poe too. As I referred in the previous reviews, Poe did not only lose his Virginia but also his biological mother\u2014and his foster mother as well. This theme of losing a woman had always been present in Poe\u2019s poems as well as his short stories. The poem is symbolic\u2014 the imagery is clarion.

(Someone please explain the antithetical concept of a well meaning sadist. I'm afraid I might have made that up and it makes no sense.)The Raven I enjoyed. Perhaps because of its length. For me, a poem can't be too long. The longer the poem, the higher my risk of death(probably through suicide) before I might finish it. Nor can a poem be too short. I know a lot of you out there think, the shorter the better when it comes to poetry, but a short poem is just a waste. The author should have put the time into a dirty limerick instead. Either way, the length of the Raven was, as Goldilocks was so fond of saying, just right. It told it's story and no more.The story itself was good. Poems are a difficult medium for horror, but Poe had me hooked quickly, wondering what it was tapping or rapping on his chamber door. Though it might have been better if the Raven had razor sharp talons instead of just dreadful insinuations with its 'Nevermore'The best part of the Raven for me, the poetry novice, was the clever verbiage matched with the more clever rhyming scheme.
