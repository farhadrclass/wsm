Tristan and Isabel, our protagonists (both 24 yo) fell in love while in high school, rather, Isabel fell in love, while Tristan was just happy to be getting laid. So, of course, he calls off their relationship upon graduation and thereafter enrols in the Army.Fast forward six yrs and Isabel is on the run, hiding somewhere in Rio, and Tristan, now an assassin, is hired to kill her.Pause here. Think about it. Think about the probability of Tristan being the one chosen (in the multitude of God knows how many) to kill Isabel. I mean, come on.Meanwhile, Isabel still has strong feelings for the boy who got away, which basically has her perpetually heartbroken, unwilling to even contemplate falling in love with someone else. The thing is, Tristan lost his memory -due to a head trauma- and he's shocked when Isabel calls his name.Sensing a deeper story, he more or less kidnaps her because, you know, reasons.What ensues is nothing short of comical, except, I think the intent was not to amuse. To think there are 5 more serials. *chuckles* Oh well."}, {"userName": "SueBee\u2605bring me an alpha!\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15735368-suebee-bring-me-an-alpha", "userReview": "LIVE! | AMZ US | AMZ UK |COLOR ME INTRIGUED!Book 1.LIVE! | AMZ US | AMZ UK |Blurb: He\u2019s death for hire\u2026 Some people measure life in hours.

She's just that good. And riveting. And romantic. And heart-breaking. And about a thousand other adjectives that add up to one inescapable truth: the woman can tell a story like few others on my keeper shelf. If she's on yours--and even if she isn't--this is the book that will have you placing the author into a different stratosphere of greatness.The Red Ledger is Wild's most daring, suspenseful, and brilliantly executed work to date--she has said this series is like the Hacker books on crack, and she REALLY means it--so just clear your schedule and expect to be doing nothing else as you turn pages on this book as fast as you can. This is romantic suspense at the genre's finest, earning the woman a solid place beside Nora Roberts, Sandra Brown, and Julie Garwood for take-no-prisoners, leave-me-alone-I'm reading, grab-me-in-the-heart-and-don't-let-go plotting, pacing, and technical excellence. I am completely HOOKED on this story--but more than that, I am solidly invested in these two incredible characters, who have to face eye-popping odds to find their way to each other. They're both crafted with layers of such intricate care and beautiful detail, you're invested in them as people and not just names on a page. A truly stunning book, serving as the gateway to what's sure to be an amazing romance suspense series.

And what does she hope to achieve here?Because I'm damn sure there more to her agenda than she is actually disclosing.I'm hoping all these questions and more will finally get answered in the next instalment; can't wait.This was such a fascinating read and the only thing that pulled it down slightly for me was I wasn't entirely convinced at how swiftly Tristan went from cold to caring in regards to Isobel.Despite that slight nitpick this is one that I highly recommend.Thank You to the Author for providing me with an ARC of \"The Red Ledger: (Part 1)\" of which I have reviewed voluntary.All opinions expressed are entirely my own.Reviewed By Beckie Bookwormhttps://www.facebook.com/beckiebookworm/www.beckiebookworm.com"}, {"userName": "Martha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4407158-martha", "userReview": "WOW!

Her books perfectly weave together unforgettable characters, consuming stories, and a palpable heat that is brought to life through her spectacular writing. I have loved each and every one of her stories, but what she has begun with this new series and what she has so exceptionally created in this first part is in a league of its own. The Red Ledger is one of the most addicting reads I have ever read. This book took me on one helluva whirlwind from start to finish, and made for one serious intense and consuming read that I could not get enough of. I loved every part of this story. I loved the literal fire it sent through me as I read it. I loved how it left me breathless at times. I loved that it gave me a story unlike any other I've ever read before. And I loved that it started what I know will be one of my favorite series.The first part of this series follows the suspenseful story of Isabel and Tristan. He's murder for hire, and her name is at the top of his list. Yet the moment he goes to do the deed, her breathless whisper of his name, his real name changes everything. You see Tristan and Isabel have a past, yet he doesn't remember any of it. She does though, and the more time he hesitates, the more he wonders about that past and the world of feeling that lays in that past that he can still feel the edges of. He also can't seem to stop thinking about her and wondering more about what he's forgotten. This story follows them as they set off on the run, as he tries to find the answers he seeks, and as she tries to see if the Tristan she loved all those years ago is somehow still in the man who was hired to kill her.Every word of this story will pull you in something fierce, and the more you get with these two, the more you will need more. Meredith Wild makes this world, these characters, and their story addicting to say the least, and she will have you beyond ready to see what will unfold in this new world and series. This world in this book and series is darker, its grittier and more complicated, yet there is a tangible and palpable fire that will pull your mind and heart into every breathtaking word. From start to finish this book will have you on the edge of your seat ready to see where that next turn of the page will bring you, and trust me when I say that you will be so enraptured by it all. The Red Ledger was fantastic. It was a phenomenal, quick, utterly suspenseful and fiery read that was intense as all get out and one of the most consuming reads I've read in such a long time. I loved getting every word of Isabel and Tristan's story, and I can't wait to see where those next chapters will take them both. Through every twist and turn, every action packed moment, and through every ounce of connection she created between these two characters, Meredith Wild created such an unforgettable read that I loved with all that I had! The Red Ledger is a book that will have you so in it all ready for more, and that is just part of what makes it such an incredible read."}, {"userName": "Melissa Crump", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22088997-melissa-crump", "userReview": "Meredith Wild is pulling out all the stops with this new series!

Red is sent to kill his former love, Foster, but is unable to after realizing she holds the secrets to the past he never knew he wanted to relive.

I read both part one and two back to back; I could not put them down, because this story has everything a reader craves: fast-pacing, a mind-numbing mystery, thrilling action, steamy romance, and moments of such intensity you're aching for more.

If my heading doesn\u2019t get your attention, do these superlatives? Meredith WIld has always been an awesome writer, but for this story, she dug deep into her bag of tricks and brought out a new style. Just amazing! I can NOT say it enough . . . just amazing.From the very beginning of this book I was held captive; drawn in tighter with each word passed and each page turned. Understanding the dark side of humanity, and realizing we are not as safe as we seem had me all in. Meredith takes us back in time to show how this came about for our characters, twisting us deeper into their saga. Tristan\u2019s inner struggles haunt him still. Isabel battles to deal with love lost at a young age. Circumstances beyond their control have caused them to find each other again. The resurgence of their connection left me speechless. Anyone who knows me, knows that is a feat with itself.As I write this review understand you need to carve some time out of your day/night to read this story, because once started, it will not easily be put down.What a wonderful story Meredith.

But, I have never had the time to read anything by her, til now. I saw that she was starting a new series and that it was a thriller/suspense.

There are 6 parts to this series and they are expected to release this year, so YAY on not waiting long to see how this all pans out.Tristan remembers nothing of his life except the last three years. The three years he's been a killer for hire. He has no emotion, has no qualms over what he does. He's a robot in all sense of how he goes about life. Isabel remembers who Tristan was before he went off grid. But that's not who he is anymore. But she can't walk away from, because he won't let her. And not for the reasons you think.Meredith delivers a suspenseful story full of twists, unknown possibilities and a lot of information that has you already trying to figure out who is behind everything.

And the biggest question of it all is: will he get his memory back by spending as much time as possible with Isabel? I do have my doubts, but at the same time, i've heard of weirder things. So maybe sights, smells or even sounds will jog his memory so he'll remember just what she meant to him. Here's the other kicker - this man is a trained for hire assassin and someone wants Isabel gone for good, and for some reason, Tristan didn't go through with it. So here's my question: where will readers be taken if Tristan is so damn cautious? Will he really sit back and let the memories arrive one after the other or will he get hit with all of them at once or is it a lost cause?

A tale that will be full of romance, passion, heat and every now and then a dirty talking Alpha male. Trust me, she can bring the heat!Yet, this time Meredith decided to venture from her norm. To open a door she had not been through and to do something a little different. And truly that has paid off for her with The Red Ledger Series.Tristan: A damaged man swiped from the throes of death only to return as the giver of death. Isabella: A scorned woman on a mission to forget the love she lost only to fall prey to him again.Sounds like a simple love story, correct? Boy meets girl, girl loses boy, they reconnect, girl saves boy, boy saves girl and they ride off into the wild blue yonder and all's right with the world. Umm, not so much. The journey that brings these two lost souls back together is not as simple as one would expect. She remembers him, he\u2019s forgotten her. She\u2019s learning to trust, he\u2019s trying to remember. So many battles, so many roads, so much distrust, and yet somehow they must find a way to work together, all while fighting the undeniable attraction.Meredith has started this series with me on the edge of my seat, heart palpitating, and the hunger for more taking over!This is the 1st of 6 books in a series . . . so as the story continues . . . so will my reviews.

A covert military mission gone wrong robbed me of my memory and any link to my past. This is my existence now. I execute and survive. Nothing more, nothing less. I was ready to write Isabel Foster\u2019s name in my ledger of unfortunate souls until she uttered the one word that could stop the bullet meant for her. My name. She knows my face. She knows me. She\u2019s the key to the memories I\u2019m not sure I want back. Now nothing is simple. I still have a job to do, and my soul isn\u2019t worth saving. I\u2019m not the man she thinks I am. I can\u2019t love her.
