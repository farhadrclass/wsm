This doesn't seem to be it.Here are the Maya, killing some peopleIt's close. How close depends on whose word you want to take. This version was probably written down in the 1550s, so well after Spanish arrival, in Quiche, which is the language still spoken by the Maya. The Maya are a civilization dating back to 2600 BCE; they reached the apex of their power and influence around 300 - 900 CE; they built Chichen Itza and other cities between 900 and 1500 CE; the arrival of conquistadores in the 1500s caused a little genocide but they're still around today.This is Chichen Itza, in Mexico.This is more or less the Bible of the Maya, and either it shows how similar civilization origin stories tend to be, or it's been badly infected by the Bible. \"There is the original book and ancient writing owned by the lords,\" says our narrator, \"now lost.\" We don't know who that narrator is. This version, by Dennis Tedlock, is universally considered the definitive English one. It comes with tons of killer illustrations from Maya vases and cave paintings and other texts. Mayan art is super cool.The Biblical parallels start right away, with the word. \"The earth arose because of (the gods), it was simply their word that brought it forth. For the forming of the earth they said 'earth.'\" There's a flood to wipe out some incompetent early humans who don't praise the gods enough, which is really the only reason the gods made them. Flood myths are universal; there's one in Gilgamesh, which is well before the Bible. The Maya add their own flavor: the flood is accompanied by a good amount of eye gouging and face crushing. There's an awesome part where the people's own pots yell, like, \"I crush your face!\" at them and then crush their faces. The Maya were big on face crushing. The whole book is super violent. Later on the gods try again with people. This time it goes better, but they accidentally make them too good - they have limitless sight. The gods don't want the competition so they dim their gaze, but the Guatemalan lords of Quiche retained an instrument for seeing far; they called it the council book, or Popol Vuh. Ta-dah!This book doesn't contain prophecies, though, which again raises the question of exactly which version of the Popol Vuh we're reading. This is more of an origin story. So let's get back to it: two early heroes, One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu, visit the underworld Xibalba - just like Achilles and Gilgamesh did. There's a river of forgetfulness down there, like the Styx - and, this being the Maya, another river of pus. Gross!Here's the underworld. Skeleton guy in the middle is Xibalba, the lord of Xibalba.They're defeated by a test in a place called Dark House, where they're given cigars that have to burn without being consumed. But their children Hunahpu and Xbalanque (twins, born of a virgin and sacrificed and resurrected later) later pass that test; they put fireflies on the ends of the cigars. Clever! Then they defeat the lords of the underworld in a ball game. The ball game is a big part of Maya culture, btw, and the fun part is that the losing team gets decapitated. That didn't always happen. It did in the Popol Vuh. Here's a video of some dudes playing the game but not getting decapitated. Here's a mural from Chichen Itza's ball court, showing some dudes using a decapitated head for a ball. The thing in the middle is the headWe move on to a story about how the Maya split up into different tribes, with different languages, which is bad news. There's some internecine fighting. There's an exodus deal, including a parting of the sea. One group - and you sortof lose track here of which group is which, the editors don't seem clear on it either - anyway, one group wants to trap the other group so they send the two hottest daughters in the land to seduce them, and they're like now don't fuck this up, hot daughters, you definitely have to actually fuck these dudes. And bring back proof, reverse 16 Candles style.Btw one of them is named Lust Woman which is sort of a Pilgrim's Progress kind of problem there, like you give your kid a name like that you gotta figure her adolescence is gonna be weird. Anyway the daughters do indeed fuck it all up so the tribes try direct war, but are defeated by a castle manned by puppets and booby trapped with wasps, which seem to be quite a thing for the Maya - they pop up a lot - which to be fair I am also scared of wasps. Have you ever been stung by a wasp? It hurts!And then there's a long list of various tribes and leaders, which has sortof the same effect as one of those \"begat\" lists from the Bible, in that you don't read it, and that's the end of the Popol Vuh. Aside from the begats, these are good stories. There are some really cool parts - like, in addition to that Dark House I mentioned, there are all these other houses, each containing a different trap - like that Cube movie, more or less. There's Blade House and Bat House and whatnot. \"The visible sun is not the real one,\" we're told, and then the authors totally don't explain what they mean by that. They refer sometimes to an original text that they're quoting from, or transcribing. I feel like - and there's no evidence to support this at all - I feel like that's maybe what they're talking about here. This text, the visible sun, is not the real one. It illuminates some stuff anyway, and I like it. I do wonder what the real one was like.I made bookmarks. More of my weird bookmark project here."}, {"userName": "Balam", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28258938-balam", "userReview": "I was taking aback by the amount of bad reviews the kiddies are giving this awesome book. Even as a kid myself I loved the stories and the characters. It transported me to a world full of heroes, powerful lords, Kings, and princesses. As an adult I could see the spirituality behind it. The beauty in the simplicity of the text, and the stories of how humans came into being according to Mayan mythology. Joseph Campbell, in his \"Hero's Journey\" draws parallels between the Twin brothers Hun Ah'pu and Xbalam K'ej of the Popol Vuh with the heroes of many other mythologies. Harrelson Smart's seminal work \"Religion of Small Societies\" tries to explain (although not very successfully) the spirituality within the book. You can read this book many times and each time you can find something different that you did not see before or that you did not get the previous time. An excellent book if you ask me. I grew up with this edition and it may not be one of the best ones (newer editions come with better notes and even illustrations) but is a fine one to start with."}, {"userName": "Jeremy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6024878-jeremy", "userReview": "Allen J. Christenson has given us a brilliant translation (packed with very helpful notes) of the Popol Vuh, the Sacred Book of the Quich\u00e9 Maya, the \"book that pertains to the mat.\" The \"mat\" is the royal throne upon which the king gave counsel to his people, with the fibers symbolizing the interlaced community remembered in the text.This is a personal book for me, because if family legend is to be believed, the distant ancestors of my Ecuadorian relatives might have come through the area of Guatemala where the Popol Vuh was finally recorded by anonymous priests to survive the purges of the Conquistadors. We trace the family tree down from the Dawn of Creation; Tikib'a' is literally \u201cto plant,\" and so \"in the beginning\" was literally \u201cthe planting,\" with xe', root, used here to describe the foundation of the authors\u2019 words concerning the history of the Quich\u00e9 people. The subsequent narrative is seen as growing like a plant from this \u201croot.\"The Gods here are not the Neoplatonic abstractions of Christianity tainted by abstract Greek philosophy; instead they are explicitly anthropomorphic, the actual ancestors of our spirits, the shining Shapers and Modelers who descended from the darkness to organize the world out of preexisting material. The Divine Parents are Xmucane and Xpiyacoc - I'yom and K'ajolom in Quiche - the \"Mother\" and \"Father\". I'yom was \"She Who Has Borne Children\"; the title of the goddess implies that she assists in the \u201cbirth\u201d of the world. There are five stages in their attempts to create humanity, with numerous false starts. Finally, life arises in the brackish waters, and agriculture supports the creation of humans. Maize in particular is shown to create our bodies, entering into the flesh of humanity by means of the descendants of She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons, the Framer and the Shaper. The daughters of Xmucane act as the creative power that prepares the maize dough and forms it into a suitable framework to contain the essence of mankind; the unique ability of the female to form living flesh is thus emphasized. Yet the man and woman are not described as carrying out separate roles; rather, they act in concert and speak with one voice. Their activities are remembered in the performance of the text of the Popol Vuh as a Ritual Drama: \"Great is its performance and its account of the completion and germination of all the sky and earth - its four corners and its four sides. All then was measured and staked out into four divisions, doubling over and stretching the measuring cords of the womb of sky and the womb of earth.\" Indeed, the ancient Maya conceived of the universe as a great house. The four corners represent the cardinal directions while its walls and ceiling form the vault of the sky, with the foundation posts forming the boundaries of the underworld, much like a miniature version of the map made of a Temple. The maize plant is often depicted as a divine axis mundi standing at the center point of the universe with its roots extending downward into the underworld while its stalk reaches into the sky. \"Behold us! Hear us! Do not abandon us. ... You are the god in the sky and on the earth, you, Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth. May our sign, our word, be given for as long as there is sun and light.\" (Etal [sign] and tzijel [word, as well as the act of lighting a candle or torch] when paired together refer to the posterity of children and grandchildren.)So when their children are sacrificed in the ballcourt to the Lords of Death, all of Xibalba (the \"Place of Fear\") perceived the greatness of the essence of the calabash tree which resurrected One Hunahpu's head. The virgin Lady Blood heard the story from her father and asked \"Can I not come to know it by seeing the Tree that has been spoken of? I hear that its fruit is truly delicious.\" She goes to converse with One Hunahpu's Tree, which causes her to become pregnant; though her father tries to sacrifice her for the supposed sin, she escapes and bears the children of the Tree who travel to the Underworld to overcome mortality. Christenson notes: \"The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is one of the most prominent motifs in ancient Mesoamerican art and literature. The Maya saw death as a necessary part of life. For maize to grow and produce, a seed must first die and be buried in the earth. It was thus necessary for One Hunahpu to descend into the underworld to die before a new generation could appear and be capable of overcoming death. The maiden, Lady Blood, stood as an intermediary. As the daughter of one of the principal lords of death, she belonged to the darkness of the underworld. As the consort of One Hunahpu, she had the potential to create new life from death.\"Next comes a cycle of animal-stories in an allegorical sequence of louse, toad, serpent, and falcon, signifying decay, death, rebirth, and apotheosis as sun and moon. The corrupting louse is swallowed by the fertile underworld toad, swallowed by the regenerating snake, swallowed by the falcon who flies into the dawn. Death swallowed by Hunahpu and his brother Xbalanque, who triumph over the Lords of Xibalba, whose hidden names they have discovered, whose deadly ballgame they have won, and whose many houses of horrific trials they have passed through alive, only to knowingly die and be resurrected in various forms (chosen orphan-boys, fish-people), dancing in front of the Lords of Death. This fulfills the prophecy of Lady Blood, who told them that one day they would no longer be allowed to take human hearts in sacrifice, but would take the blood of trees rather than that of the Children of Light. The brothers come to dwell in the sky, arising as the central stars of a constellation. Their children cross the great sea from the land in the East, where the first People were conceived, and there they looked for the coming forth of the sun, when they had one common language and did not yet call upon wood or stone. \"However many nations there are today, innumerable people, they all had but one dawn.\" The Dawn begins beautifully, but then descends once more into human sacrifice as if it were holy, with countless tribes which should be family attacking each other any way they can, including plagues of insects. After generations of horrific bloodshed, the Spaniards arrive in force, and officially establish Roman Catholicism against great protest in 1534 in order to wipe out whatever \"idolatry\" and \"paganism\" might have survived the purges of the conquest itself. (As a member of the LDS church, which believes in a Mother and Father God who have physical forms, just as the Maya did, I have great trouble thinking that the violence and book-burning of the conquest was exactly a Christian act; we believe that true Christianity was lost long before Arius and Athanasius occasioned the great Councils to establish the Creeds which focused on the disembodied abstractions of philosophers rather than the living Gods and the Divine Council formed of their family.) Thankfully, there were other Priests such as Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas who vigorously opposed the slaughters of Alvarado. The book ends in dark tragedy and tortures in which there are precious few good guys; the human sacrifices made in the name of a twisted version of the early Maya religion were hardly better than the slaughter brought by the conquistadors; take your pick as to which people were the worse transgressors in the name of their Gods. And so: \"this is the essence of the Quich\u00e9s, because there is no longer a way of seeing [the vision of] it. It was with the Lords at first, but it is now lost. There is only this. All is now completed concerning Quich\u00e9, called Santa Cruz.\""}, {"userName": "Marlen Leiva", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61024544-marlen-leiva", "userReview": "Me ha parecido muy interesante, la visi\u00f3n que ten\u00edan los pueblos hispanoamericanos, acerca de la creaci\u00f3n del universo, y como algunas partes tienen similitud con la visi\u00f3n cristiana.La \u00fanica parte que me ha parecido un poco dif\u00edcil de leer es la parte de la creaci\u00f3n de las tribus.

A warning for those looking for a definitive edition of the text: this isn't it, being not a translation, as such, but more a summary of the text with background cultural and anthropological material. It was first published in 1908, it seems, and so might be called a 'monograph'; not exactly a textbook and not exactly an essay, but a scholarly piece of writing on one particular subject. Much of the summary is highly poetic, and, indeed, the source material is full of deeply strange and resonant imagery. The background cultural/anthropological material suffers from being too terse, not dwelling on the material in enough depth to allow the reader to distinguish the ideas, images, names and so on, to let them take shape in the mind. However, those who enjoy the slightly stuffy scholarly style of the period will still find interesting passages here.I also wonder how up-to-date the material is. In particular, the last sections dwell on human sacrifice. In a podcast (In Our Time, inevitably), on the Mayans, one of the guests (an expert, etc.) denied that there had been human sacrifice among the Mayans, but there was absolutely no elaboration on this most interesting point on the programme. Did he mean that these reports should attach to other peoples in the same general geographic area, or that all such reports are entirely false, and, in either case, on what was his claim based? Perhaps all I need to do in order to answer these questions is undertake a few minutes of research (I don't know), but I have not got round to it. In any case, this did make me wonder if modern scholars would dispute the facts as presented by Spence."}, {"userName": "Barbara Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4740416-barbara-bradley", "userReview": "I had the good fortune of reading the \"Popol Vuh\" under the tutelage of Dennis himself, and there really is no way to describe the detail and the power of the text. I highly recommend to pay special attention to every single symbol, every picture in the book (no matter how small or minor) because each one bears an important insight into the Mayan culture. For example, on page 107 there is a picture of a dancing monkey with quill pins bunched atop his head.

Popol Vuh doesn\u2019t merely sketch out a story of creation that occurred in the distant past, it links that creation all the way through the time of the European invasion of the Americas and the effective end of Mayan supremacy; it\u2019s as if the Prose and Poetic Eddas were written while Ragnarok was happening, or if the Greek/Roman myth cycle lasted until the Pantheon was overthrown by the next generation of gods. These mythologies had a story to explain their end, but Popol Vuh is a mythology that lived to see its end. Popol Vuh is especially interesting as a mythological text because it presents us with gods who are fallible from the beginning. It takes numerous attempts before they successfully make humanity, their failures sometimes surviving in other forms (animals) and other times just falling apart into dirt and mud (nicely illustrating the life lesson that sometimes mistakes can actually be productive, but sometimes they\u2019re just a waste of your time and effort. Too many texts emphasize the first part while failing to grasp the second). If there\u2019s a story where one of the Greek pantheon goes up to Hephaestus and says \u201cplease make me this thing\u201d and Hephaestus answers \u201csorry, I have no idea how to do that\u201d I\u2019m not familiar with it. The Mayan gods are not all powerful either, and much of the first three parts of the text concern the efforts of the gods to outsmart the brutal lords of the underworld using their wits instead of overwhelming force. There is no Zeus equivalent here to thrash the enemies of the pantheon, instead creation and existence are a struggle even for the gods, who can lose contests and die when things don\u2019t go their way. Man is presented as far closer to the divine in the Mayan myths than in most other myth systems, as man serves as the \u201cknower\u201d as well as the \u201crecorder.\u201d It is through man that the acts of the divine can be transcribed and the world understood. There are numerous parallels in the Popol Vuh to other myths and religions- there\u2019s a great flood, for instance, there\u2019s a point where the divine saviors die and are reborn (though after five days, not three) and are more powerful than ever after death, there is a Babel-like segment where the gods fear the power of man and so they handicap them (though by reducing their sight, not by confusing their language), there\u2019s even a Prometheus character here. The Mayan myths aren\u2019t just lesser shadows of the Western myths, however, as throughout the text the Mayan myths feel alive and visceral in a way that I haven\u2019t seen in a very long time. I read Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses earlier in the year, and though that is a masterfully constructed and excellently written text, it felt more like a literary endeavor than a work of passionate belief. Perhaps Ovid believed in the Roman gods, perhaps he believed in them quite strongly, but it is clear to me that he doesn\u2019t see them in every sunrise, beneath every rock, living in every shadow and animal and house and ear of corn like the author of the Popol Vuh did. If you like reading mythology there are few if any books I would recommend more highly than the Popol Vuh, which is why I\u2019m giving it five stars (only the second 5-star ranking I\u2019ve given out of the 70 books I\u2019ve read so far this year).The Dennis Tedlock edition is wonderful. The extensive introduction summarizes the events of the main text, so you never have trouble understanding what\u2019s going on. The extensive notes and glossary mean that not only will you be able to look up anything that you don\u2019t understand or don\u2019t remember, but you can also read about the linguistic nuances of the translation and see an analysis of how the Popol Vuh relates to the Mayan calendar. Finally the book is embellished by many pictures and images taken from Mayan artifacts and art, which help to make the story more vivid and the text feel more vital. I could not name a single way in which the text could be made better.P.S. I have a theory that Tohil is a death god that somehow survived the earlier age and escaped the underworld slaughter done by Hunahpu and Xbalanque, given that Tohil is first introduced by a Xibalban messenger.

Absent a law code, it is divided into two parts, a Genesis, and a Chronicle of kings. But what I find remarkable is that the stories of the \"Genesis\" section are not myths in the Western sense -- stories rooted in psychology. Rather they are stories rooted in _astronomy_. It is believed that the Popol Vuh would have represented an interpretation of a hidden book, and that this hidden book would have in fact been a complex astronomical chart. And so the stories and the characters, as they come and go, fall or conquer, follow the progression of astronomical events -- the appearance of constellations or the motions of planets."}, {"userName": "Kerim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16193517-kerim", "userReview": "Refreshing and engaging look at one of the best preserved accounts of the earliest complete work of literature as recorded from oral tradition, allowing a spectacular look into the cosmological, social, and lingual mind of the ancient Maya.

Generally regarded as America's oldest book, the Popol Vuh, in fact, corresponds to our Christian Bible, and it is, moreover, the most important of the five pieces of the great library treasures of the Maya that survived the Spanish Conquest.The Popol Vuh was first transcribed in the Quiche language, \u00b7but in Latin characters, in the middle of the sixteenth century, by some unknown but highly literate Quiche Maya Indian-probably from the oral traditions of his people. This now lost manuscript was copied at the end of the seventeenth century by Father Francisco Xim\u00e9nez, then parish priest of the village of Santo Tom\u00e1s Chichicastenango in the highlands of Guatemala, today the most celebrated and best-known Indian town in all of Central America.The mythology, traditions, cosmogony, and history of the Quich\u00e9 Maya, including the chronology of their kings down to 1550, are related in simple yet literary style by the Indian chronicler. And Adrian Recinos has made a valuable contribution to the understanding and enjoyment of the document through his thorough going introduction and his identification of places and people in the footnotes.", "title": "Popol Vuh", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158264.Popol_Vuh", "average": 3.74, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388331316l/158264.jpg", "reviews": 240, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous", "name": "Anonymous"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3015992.Adri_n_Recinos", "name": "Adri\u00e1n Recinos"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/458830.Delia_Goetz", "name": "Delia Goetz"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/91682.Sylvanus_Griswold_Morley", "name": "Sylvanus Griswold Morley"}], "type": ["History", "Fantasy", "Religion", "Classics", "Nonfiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158264.Popol_Vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158262.Popol_Vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11138813-popol-vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158265.Popol_Vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17157230-popol-vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268256.The_Popol_Vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1920477.Popol_Vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18882383-popol-vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158266.Popol_Vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20333442-popol-vuh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1923820.Holy_Bible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/323355.The_Book_of_Mormon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/280111.Holy_Bible", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19351.The_Epic_of_Gilgamesh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93101.The_Arabian_Nights", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
