When a reader falls in love with something, they tell another reader, and that reader tells another ...When you see the Dodo logo, we'd like to think of our books as recommendations from one book lover to another.An admirable mission statement. But of course love is blind, and the resulting books are somewhat idiosyncratic, and may not be to everyone's taste. As a God Might Be was a 600 page theological novel - wonderful for me, but not for everyone I fear, Dodo Ink's first book this year (The Tryst) was an erotic novella, and now we have Unamerican Activities.From Dodo Ink's website (an authorial manifesto?), the novel sets out to subvert and pay homage to American pop culture and genre fiction, exploring the conspiracy theories and violence that defines the American everyday through a series of deranged and desperate narrators.The story is told as a collection of related 1st person tales from different perspectives. Covey, narrator of the first, Eat My Face, takes drugs and bums around with his friend Rick, a conspiracy theories who is convinced a nearby, seemingly-abandoned, house is in fact home to a coven of vampires:'They run things, you do understand this don't you?' Rick says. 'They've lived for thousands of years and they regenerate themselves when they need to. It's the original bloodline, that's the one we need to get.'Rick often talks like this. He's fond of vampires, very interested. Vampires, aliens, illuminati. All that shit. He has his theories, says there's a big difference between humans who have been made into vampires by other vampires and those who are part of the vampire race that one ruled the earth tens of thousands of years ago and those who used humans as their slaves. Rick's father later returns from a stint in prison, with a violent criminal friend Rawlings, and concurs on the existence of vampires, explaining that summary justice for child abusers and other undesirables in the prison was administered, while the guards turned a blind eye, by a face-eating vampire, held, unageing, on death row for decades.The following stories - with titles such as Exploding Zombie Cock, The Kiss of the Nephilim and The Abomination of Desolation - continue these themes with frequent appearances of guns, fracking-related conspiracies, the Nephilim, Illuminati, zombies and zombie-creating potions from Haiti, aliens and UFOs, ancient but advanced civilisations, drugs, porn, vampires and a vampire hunter (a direct descendent of Helsing), men in black from Homeland Security buying up vampire hearts, gun-toting sheriffs in isolated communities who sacrifice the criminals they catch, and weird religious cults. Characters from the different stories reappear - e.g. Rawlings resurfaces several stories later in the survivalist community mentioned below - although there is no coherent story line or narrative progression per se. Although as one character observes: the strands connect, it\u2019s all part of the same scene, a subterranean America full of un-American activities.To the extent there is a common thread from the strands, it centers around some strange going-on in deep holes that have mysteriously appeared in the North Dakotan bad-lands, and also on \"Youthtube\", run by President Buer, one the Nephilim, which lures wannabe teen pop stars into making porno videos ('red and blacks'), their biggest star Trixxxie Foxxx (real name Madison Parker Lee), also sourcing girls and material from its secretly-owned revenge porn hosting site myexgirlfriend.com.And the story gradually converges around Esther, a 15 year-old girl, whose religious and conspiracy-theory loving mother is ostensibly on her way from Florida to investigate the North Dakotan goings-on but diverts to hook up as the third wife of Earl, who runs a survivalist community, White Pines, as well as posting videos on the web, sourced from a contact in the North Dakota national guard, of what is happening there. Esther laments at one point:Why wasn't I born in Europe, somewhere nice like - I don't know - like Norway? I want to give and live in Norway. It looks nice over there, the fjords, the mountains, the cold, the sensible people who don't believe in the end of the world.(which later provides an excuse for some gratuitous Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd satire)The camp is eventually overrun by Homeland Security, after two of their men-in-black are killed by White Pines pastor in a (covered-up) struggle over a vampire heart.The novel ends, 5 years later, with Esther at the Hay Festival, where she appears alongside the porn-star-turned-respected-author Madison. Esther now an internationally successful YA author, with her books inspired by the known-story of her time at White Pines, before she was rescued by the authorities, and also by her untold knowledge of the actual goings-on in North Dakota.And Miller, as the overall author/narrator, provides a slightly odd meta-topping and tailing of the book - an Unprologue and Unepilogue - claiming that the stories are based, with details changed, on conversations with the author Esther (whose real identity he has hidden) at her book launch and on unsolicited stories sent to him by email from a mysterious loner from the States. Our author/narrator's take on the stories sent:I struggled to know what to make of it at all, if what I was reading was an elaborate joke or deadly serious or probably both. There was crazy stuff about vampires and aliens, porn-stars and meth addicts, secret conspiracies to rule the world and dark secrets buried in the earth. Was it genre fiction, satire of some strange hybrid of both?Which could serve as a review of the novel itself. I admire what Miller is trying to achieve but the problem in creating a tribute to conspiracy obsessed shlock-fiction by writing a story consisting (meta-narrative aside) of conspiracy obsessed shlock-fiction is that the reader is left reading a book that largely consists of conspiracy obsessed shlock-fiction, and not really to my taste.2.5 stars rounded up to 3"}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "A striking prologue frames UnAmerican Activities as the edited remains of a cache of documents emailed to Miller by a mysterious individual known only as Tim. Together, they form a motley patchwork of interlinked stories portraying a USA not quite ravaged, but certainly battered, by drugs, cults, vampires, porn, guns and many other vices and anomalies. Trailer parks and McDonald's coexist with ritual sacrifice and alien conspiracies. In these pages, ex-cons go vampire hunting, a guy turns his love rival into a zombie by spiking his drink, and America is obsessed with the pay-per-view, NSFW \u2018red and blacks\u2019 pushed as add-ons to \u2018YouthTube\u2019 videos (where the internet's barely-legal stars go for cash when they can't make it as singers or make-up artists).If you pick up UnAmerican Activities, look at the cover and leaf through it, you may well decide it\u2019s a polarising type of book (the fantastic story titles include the likes of \u2018Eat My Face\u2019 and \u2018Exploding Zombie Cock\u2019) but it\u2019s nothing like first impressions might suggest. It's funny (with bite), energetic and incredibly readable, constantly surprising and so varied in tone that I feel like everyone will find something to like here. There are a couple of misfires: the story told from the POV of an uptight academic makes its protagonist too much of a stuffy caricature; the one about the porn star experiments with a more unconventional style that\u2019s only half successful. But I had a lot of fun with this book nevertheless. It\u2019s a wild ride. I\u2019d love to read more.I received an advance review copy of UnAmerican Activities from the publisher, Dodo Ink.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Neil", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil", "userReview": "Unamerican Activities is published by Dodo Ink, one of the UK\u2019s small, independent publishers. On it\u2019s website, Dodo Ink says it \"\u2026will publish original fiction, with a focus on risk-taking, imaginative novels. We are looking for books which don\u2019t fall into easy marketing categories and don\u2019t compromise their intelligence or style to fit in with trends.\"This novel is actually a collection of interlinked short stories. In the blurb on its website, Dodo Ink says \"James Miller\u2019s wild and wonderful novel reads like Jesus's (sic) Son [short story collection by Denis Johnson] reimagined by Guillermo del Toro. It is an acerbic, hilarious novel \u2013 a satirical, surreal mishmash of the interconnecting fates of vampires, porn stars and religious fanatics and a portrait of the underbelly of American life.\"The key to understanding this description is that the book is a set of connected short stories. The comparison with Denis Johnson is a bit misleading except that both writers focus on the darker side of society. Unfortunately for Dodo Ink, Jesus' Son is my favourite book, so mentioning it immediately put me on alert. Either this was going to become my second favourite book or it was going to be a bit of a let down. In the end, it was the second of those two options.In all fairness, I think this might be simply because I am not the target demographic for a book like this. I can imagine that the me of 40 years ago may well have loved this with its interconnected mixture of vampires, zombies, religious fanaticism, violence and porn. But the older and more boring me of today did not react so positively.The way to get most out of this book is, I think, to take the time to plot the interconnections. There\u2019s plenty of action in the stories, but I wasn\u2019t really engaged in any of them. It's more interesting to attempt to understand the overarching story that connects them all. However, even then, only some of the stories contribute to the overall narrative. Story 1 lets us know we are thinking about vampires, but other than introducing a character who will return 7 stories later, it doesn\u2019t seem to add much else. Story 3 (the bizarrely named \"Exploding Zombie Cock\" - yes, really) is narrated by the son of the narrator of Story 2, but its ending is left hanging and it seems to serve no purpose in the bigger story. Story 7 (\"You\u2019ve Gone Too Far This Time\") focuses on a global pornstar but, apart from a brief mention of North Dakota, doesn\u2019t seem to progress anything. It has lots of sex in it, though.That said, the other stories add up to a tale in which something mysterious is uncovered in North Dakota, a woman and her daughter set off to go there but detour to a religious sect which is hunting and killing vampires.I am willing to allow the possibility that I have missed things in the stories and there is more going on that I give credit for. I did create a reasonably large mind map to show the connections between characters. But, to be honest, it\u2019s all a bit silly, really. As one character observes late on in the bookIn all honesty, I thought it was fairly awful, clich\u00e9d nonsense with daft characters, predictable plots, gauche sentimentality \u2013 all the stuff I hate in a novel \u2013 but then I guess I wasn\u2019t the target audience.There\u2019s not much \"gauche sentimentality\", but the rest applies. And, as I\u2019ve said, I guess it\u2019s true that I\u2019m not the target audience.I will give some credit for the fact that one character has exactly the same reaction to Knausgaard as I had which made me laugh:\"'I read the first one, all about his father dying. I didn\u2019t get it really. It\u2019s sort of grim and nothing happens.''Nothing?''Well his father dies and he spends about two hundred pages cleaning out his old house. It was rather depressing.'In summary, this wasn\u2019t my kind of book. There\u2019s some fun to be had with the connections between the stories, but that was about it for me.My thanks to Dodo Ink for a review copy."}, {"userName": "Gumble's Yard", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard", "userReview": "Dodo Ink is an independent UK small publisher which publishes \u201coriginal fiction, with a focus on risk-taking, imaginative novels \u2026\u2026 great writing which isn\u2019t being picked up by the mainstream.\u201d. James Miller runs the Creative Writing MA at Kingston University. When I saw a book with this title by an author with this surname I thought immediately of the playwright Arthur Miller and his \u201cThe Crucible\u201d, a play I studied at high school and which satirised and confronted the official anti-Communist conspiracy theory of the 20th Century which underlay both the Mc Carthy hearings and the longer-running House Un-American Activities Committee, comparing it to the 17th Century religious-fanaticism inspired, but again at least partly officially sanctioned, conspiracy theories of the Salem witch-hunts. This book too is I think a satire of American conspiracy theories \u2013 but in this case those of the 21st Century, where the theories are underground ones and target the heart of the conspiracy as residing in the US Government, and where the religious elements are decidedly on the fringe \u2013 albeit perhaps concentrating on these more outlandish theories serves as a satire of a post-truth, fake news America. The book is a series of connected (The strands connect, it\u2019s all part of the same scene, a subterranean America full of un-American activities.) first party chapters from a series of (in the words of the back page blurb) deranged and desperate narrators \u2013 including the friend of a son of convict who on his release returns with bizarre tales of a prison-vampire who exerts summary justice on the worse prisoners and also brings with him a vampire hunter; an Academic on his way to a dig in Dakota which has uncovered some bizarre secret, but who is captured by some policeman (with the collusion of his younger girlfriend) and sacrificed to some God-like beings; the academic\u2019s son who ends up turning a love rival into a Zombie; Esther \u2013 whose mother has become involved in a survivalist cult convinced that the dig in Dakota has uncovered evidence of a race of Vampires who are descended from the Nephilim of Genesis 6, Esther is the only character with three chapters, in the second she goes to the survivalist camp and in the last one she is reading at Hay-on-Wye from her fictionalisation of what she witnessed; one of the Nephilim who is captured by some vampire hunters; a head vampire hunter (a relative of Van Helsing from Stoker\u2019s Dracula) who kills the vampire and later meets the ex-boyfriend of an internet sensation porn-star; the porn-star who meets the head of the channel, himself seemingly a Nephilim; the head of the survival cult, who buys the vampires heart in an effort to dramatically boost the appeal of his movement (later we read from the now-author that his camp was raided by the feds and all of the main leaders killed or jailed. These stories are sandwiched by two from the author himself explaining the genesis of the book \u2013 partly based on a series of fragmental stories emailed to him by an internet correspondent who then disappeared and partly on a meeting he had with Esther. As he says: \nIt\u2019s not like we have a meaningful plot here anyway, there\u2019s no clear trajectory \u2026\u2026 no that\u2019s not what happens and we all know it\u2019s not the way things happen, not in life even if in fiction. But, as a I tell my students, books or rather \u201ctexts\u201d have nothing to do with life anyway - books are about other books and yes, we use them to explain things to ourselves, but they never quite match up, stories and reality, stories and life, not really. And perhaps that\u2019s for the best\n And this seems to get at the heart of the book \u2013 it really is not about much at all other than a part satire to, part tribute of a rather extreme version of American genre fiction. Perhaps also it is meant to be some form of satire on the current state of America, but if it is, then unlike the other Miller, it falls short of achieving this and I cannot agree that it is for the best. The author\u2019s reaction on receiving the fragments serves as a clear summary of my review. \nI struggled to know what to make of it at all \u2026.. There was crazy stuff about vampires and aliens, porn-stars and meth addicts, secret conspiracies to rule the world \u2026 Was it genre fiction, satire of some strange hybrid of both \u2026. What was I meant to say\n Subsequent to my review I have read an essay by the authorhttp://www.berfrois.com/2017/11/james...Where he sets out his views that late capitalist Anglo-American society is going through a period of protracted crisis and decline ..... [which] have in turn created a crisis in the notion of the real or reality .... [and that] ... the clues to the future of the Anglo-American model (exceptional no longer) may perhaps best be found in the innovations and experimentations of Third World, post-communist and European literature, traced by the past avant-gardes of modernism, magical realism, surrealism, anything that troubles realism as a stable category and has no illusions about the coherence or credibility of the field through which it moves ................ [and in conclusion proposes] ..... that the engaged writer of today responds to such a reality with what I call deranged realism, a Janus-faced fiction of beginnings and transitions, one that attempts to partake in and disengage from the maelstrom of the present moment. A radically subjective fiction, where narrators can only be unreliable, usually disreputable and almost always first person voices, immersive and obscene, inhabiting the present tense, expressive of particularities and vernaculars and \u2013 like everyone in \u2018the real\u2019 \u2013 continuously distracted, addicted to gadgets, to social media, substances and popular culture: bizarre tapestries of appetite rather than a formal coherence of character;. While I found this a very interesting essay, I can only sincerely hope that this book and the direction it takes does not represent the future of Anglo-American literature.

They tell of drug users and porn stars, college kids and religious fanatics, vampires and republicans. The dark, beating heart of the book explores the ingrained beliefs that drive so many to behave irrationally. Despite the perversions depicted the stories are somehow highly entertaining. It was an unexpected delight to find this such a captivating read.The book opens with an \u2018UnPrologue\u2019 which explains the origins of the stories that follow. It sets the tone and is a story in itself. The reader is then introduced to the first of a cast of characters who will appear intermittently throughout the collection. Each story stands alone but it is the wider plot arc that kept me so engaged.The first, Eat My Face, is a tale of drug users and gun toting criminals. Their backstories may garner a degree of sympathy but they do little to help themselves with the choices they make. High on meth, crack and alcohol they stoke their paranoias, sharing stories of vampires invading the higher echelons of influence, decrying those they blame for the sorry state of the world as they perceive it to be.\u201cUsurping the white man\u2019s power. Taking our place. Overturning the order.\u201dHope\u2019s End takes an ex-pat Professor of Ancient American Cultures at Cornell on a road trip alongside a young student with whom he is having an affair. In Iowa they are arrested for indecency, thus preventing the academic from reaching his destination, an archaeological discovery in Dakota where a strange sickness is afflicting those involved in the dig. There are strange goings on at both locations, a pastiche of Midwestern American values and beliefs.Exploding Zombie Cock completes the trio of introductory stories. It is set among wealthy students in New York playing host to a marine due to leave for a tour of Afghanistan and looking for a good time before he faces life threatening combat. When the protagonist\u2019s ex-girlfriend shows interest in the personable young soldier jealousy rears its head. A potion from a witchdoctor in Haiti that has been gathering dust in a cupboard is deployed, with unexpected effects.Pour Out The Vials introduces a family of religious extremists who believe the goings on in Dakota signify the coming of Armageddon. This is not the first time they have seen such signs and their teenage daughter has grown inured to the prophecies her mother makes through an alcoholic haze. With her father at church and her mother in a stupor she watches videos posted on a cultish blog, of strange happenings that are not explained.The Kiss Of The Nephilim brings a vampire into the cast of characters. After everything that has gone before this makes sense, bringing to the fore the dark humour of these tales. The fantastical beings and events appear no more ridiculous than the recognisable actions and prejudices of the more everyday population. Behaviours are disturbingly familiar.With five stories remaining there are still plenty of characters to get to know: a bounty hunter with a sideline in vampire slaying; an internet porn star convinced she can retain ownership of her body; a hellfire preacher decrying the wider population\u2019s fake churches, determined to drive these false Christians back to what he considers righteous ways, by whatever means.The final story offers a humorous dig at the author\u2019s own circle and neatly rounds up what has been a clever, incendiary, ludicrous in places but always entertaining wider tale. There is an UnEpilogue which confirms that this was never meant to be of a work of fiction in the style taught in creative writing workshops.\u201cthere\u2019s no clear trajectory from beginning through middle to crisis and then on to acute crisis \u2013 you know, the moment in the story when all seems lost and from where things go on to climax and resolution, the five acts\u201dIt is undoubtedly stronger for its originality, clever without being clever for its own sake.This is a rollicking ride through the hinterlands of America \u2013 I suspect the author loves the country whilst recognising its many hypocrisies and failures. As a work of literature it is impressive in its lightly presented depth.
