Her novel Slammerkin remains one of my favourite pieces of historical fiction. I very much enjoyed this collection of historical short stories. I read it in one day (admittedly much of this day was spent on a plane). I was lucky enough to hear the author speak about the book and where the stories came from. Emma described the freedom of zooming in on a single moment in history, rather than creating a whole novel around it. She described herself as a collector of historical moments or tidbits of information which stick to her \"like burrs.\" These stories are not interconnected as seems to be the fashion in short fiction nowadays. They are thematically linked around the idea of immigration, travel, and displacement. Emma Donoghue is the kind of chameleon-like writer who can inhabit many voices and styles. Her style is not instantly recognizable or familiar, her skill is that she can write in many styles.This is a great book for lovers of historical fiction that want to try short fiction, or people who would like to dip into historical fiction but are intimidated by the length of the typical novel-length piece of historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52374080-mark", "userReview": "Astray is a collection of short stories based on real events. Emma has researched and found bits and pieces of events - be they birth records, census counts, stories passed down or interesting items found in old journals and newspapers. Around these scraps of information she has built her short stories - almost as a way of connecting piece A (the birth record of Jane) to piece D (Jane leaves home with her two daughters, fleeing into the arms of a wealthy man). So what happened in Jane's life, why was she forced to leave town and what of her ex-husband? It is these unknown gaps where Donoghue weaves her story to create a plausible 'reason' of events - and of course a fictional one.To be honest reading the first of the short stories I was wondering if this was for me. It seemed a little haphazard and just wasn't drawing me in. There were a couple more of the stories that were the same, just wanted to move onto the next one. There are fourteen short stories in this collection and I can say I was interested in probably ten of them, so not a bad percentage over all.One of the things that you need to get used to is that a lot of the stories are written in first person as a form of narration. The others are heavily told through dialogue, up to 90% of the story in some cases. One story is actually just a collection of letters sent from one party to the other. Where most of them centre around a \"wrong\" I did enjoy the fact that sometimes you were seeing through the eyes of the offender and some stories through the eyes of the victim.The collection is primarily based in America, with a strong French influence. Some in Canada. they draw from the civil war era, through the gold rush and into the early 1900's. At the end of each story Donoghue gives a small explanation of the factual foundations of the plot. And these make the story sharper at times and you can appreciate her work."}, {"userName": "Tasha Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10244904-tasha-robinson", "userReview": "The latest anthology from the author of \"Room\" has an intriguing premise \u2014\u00a0vignettes and very short stories spun out from old news items and historical records \u2014\u00a0but the stories Donoghue uncovers are often rich enough to support entire novels, and yet she only elaborates enough to add a few details. In many cases it seems like the real story is starting where she ends her writing, which can make this a frustrating read. Yes, it's interesting that a slave murdered his owner and went on the run with his owner's wife, but the few bare pages Donoghue spins out of that suggest a complicated lifetime for both of them, then drops the story as the two leave together. This book is a treasure trove of writing prompts for others, in the \"What comes next for these people?\" vein, and Donoghue does a compelling job of imagining a world based on a single sentence in a historical record or census or newspaper article. But as stories, they all feel incomplete, as though this were a collection of first chapters of books."}, {"userName": "Kaarin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3438209-kaarin", "userReview": "This short story collection by Emma Donoghue examines historic and personal moments that are based on real events. Each story is followed by background information from which the narrative is based. The finished collection jumps eras and locations while Donoghue expertly switches styles of writing (including the exploration of a wide variety of dialects). This results in technically sound and well researched short stories, yet they lack something that taps into a deeper truth or heart. Thus, the book feels like a compilation of expertly composed writing exercises rather than bringing the audience into new worlds that lead to truthful moments. I found myself shying away from finishing the book and, once finished, know that the stories won't stay with me."}, {"userName": "Sky", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10087201-sky", "userReview": "-Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/Thebooknatics --I received this book through the Goodreads Giveaways, it was one of those books that captivated me from the start and just couldn\u2019t put down at all.  Emma Donoghue has taken real historic stories of people on the run or departed for adventure and love, and turned them into a work of art, almost like behind-the-scenes action. Her imagination takes us for a spin on the untold stories of beloved documented events of everyday people who left an imprint on our history of the last few centuries. She respectively tells their stories in different mannerisms all the while in character, staying true to the era\u2019s use of language, lifestyle and places. An example being, a documented, real story of love letters between two lovers, Emma has taken what was documented and already known about these people; where they lived, why the letters were being written, and has taken the scribed words and created a back story of how the lovers must have felt being apart for so long, how they were feeling, from their point of view, as they wrote the letter to their S/O, what was happening between each letter when they weren\u2019t writing. I have fallen in love with this book, maybe even inspired by a few of the stories myself. I recommend this to anyone who has a passion for history and adventure."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216164-shannon", "userReview": "While I am not typically a fan of short stories, Astray showed me how rich this literary form can be in the hands of an excellent writer. Donoghue's Room was such a good read that I was compelled to give this book a try. I'm so glad I did. (On top of being thankful for the kind librarian who let me exceed my book limit to check it out.)My main complaint with short stories has been the lack of character development. I often read books to get to know the people between their pages. What I found out in this book is that characters can be fully imagined in a few short pages - and those same characters can stay with you long after the story is read. These characters were mysterious, bold, broken, conniving and many other attributes, but each character felt real. I also loved the tidbits at the end of each story telling you the historical basis for the imagined events. These factual platforms that the author used as a jumping off point for her stories showed something the reader rarely glimpses: the spark that ignites the story. I found Astray the perfect companion for this time of year: read a story or two and then get back to baking, shopping or whatever tasks await you. Even if you prefer your fiction in longer form, I think you'll find these stories worth your time."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Old newspaper articles, snippets of interest, places visited, all become fodder for these amazing stories by Donoghue. Usually when reading a book of short stories there are always some that are my favorites, some I don't like and some I just don't get, but in this book I really enjoyed them all. That she explains were she got the idea for the story was an extra bonus and a welcome one. Some of the subjects of her stories are the characters often found on the fringes of our society, or strange characters or just those that are lost. Really enjoyed this book and recommend for all short story readers."}, {"userName": "Alena", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4456042-alena", "userReview": "When I read an author I admire, I often wonder what inspires their stories. Emma Donoghue provides the answers in this wonderful collection of historical fiction shorts about castaways, immigrants and lost souls. Each story contains an afterward referencing her inspiration -- sometimes a newspaper article, sometimes a moment in history or famous court cases.I appreciated reading the fiction story first, falling enveloped into the tiny worlds Donoghue created in a few short pages, before I knew the germ of the fact that inspired her writing. Finishing the whole collection in one day, I greedily moved from one story to the next, soaking up the atmosphere that holds the whole book together.For all the praise and noterierty Room brought Donoghue a couple years ago, Astray is a return to her earlier work. The characters all seem smeared in Dickensian grime, the streets are dirty and unfriendly, and the outcomes are rarely pleasant.No tidy bows, no pat solutions to life's challenges -- just good, tight stories about interesting characters.Loved it."}, {"userName": "Sterlingcindysu", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946086-sterlingcindysu", "userReview": "4.5. I'm a fan of short stories because 1)the writers work just as hard as with a novel but the reader gets all the reward and 2) I tend to read more faster, because \"oh, just one more, they're short!\" Unlike Anita Brookner or Maeve Binchy, when you read a book from Donoghue it's different each time--different setting, characters, style, format. Here she takes snippets (truly, just a paragraph or less) of a historical fact and fleshes out a story where the person goes \"astray\". It could be physically, emotionally, through time or through faith. It could also cover a very large elephant. One story--about rape as a war crime and child soldiers during the Revolution War of all things--won an award. Donoghue has an afterword which adds more clues to symbols' meaning for an added layer of amateur criticism."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1663300-tara", "userReview": "I was surprised and a little sad to see this book in my $1 store. I guess even big name writers can end up in these remainder bins. I quickly saw why when I started reading. Love the cover and the concept (historical short stories based on biographical snippets); each story ends with some information on the character that Donoghue based her story on. However, the early stories did not grip me at all. More like narrative sketches. I almost didn't finish.Having said that, I'm glad I continued on, as I did find a few I really enjoyed. They took more chances and the voice was more compelling. Finally, that last story in the book, \"What Remains,\" was worth more than the paltry sum I paid. A first-person narrative told from the pov of sculptor and poet Florence Wyle, and her probable partner, sculptor Frances Loring. We come in at the end of their lives when they are in a nursing home. It's richly told, poignant, and memorable."}, {"userName": "Shannon (Giraffe Days)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days", "userReview": "Within these fourteen stories, Emma Donoghue traces paths overland and oversea, navigating the different ways we can go astray, journeys of the heart and mind as much as the body. Immigrants and the immigrant story feature prominently, but these stories aren't confined to the immigrant experience. Each one is inspired by a real person, a real story - a clipping from an old paper, a museum piece, an incident in someone else's non-fiction work. From England to Canada to the United States, these stories canvass an essential element of the human condition, showing just how familiar and yet dissimilar our experiences are.In \"Man and Boy\" (London, 1882), Matthew Scott chats to his charge, Jumbo the elephant, as he tries to get the elephant onto the ship that will take him to America where he will work in a circus. The running dialogue in Scott's voice is yet another showcase of Donoghue's impressive ability to capture the individual and create a distinctive voice.\"Onward\" (London, 1854), introduces us to Caroline, a young orphaned woman who was once middle class but has fallen on hard times. To help keep her younger brother Fred and her toddler daughter Pet, she takes in gentlemen callers two or three times a day, trying to protect her child and her brother from the reality of their circumstances. A chance arrives when Fred tells her of an important man who helps people like them emigrate to Canada and Australia, and Caroline must decide whether she will leave the safety of predictability and shelter for the unknown.The lawyer in \"The Widow's Cruse\" (New York City, 1735) thinks he's struck gold when a naive, beautiful young widow comes to him for help in claiming her husband's wealth after a report of his death en route to Connecticut. But Huddlestone learns the hard way never to underestimate a woman, or be led astray by his own narrow opinion of their intellect (or his greed).In \"Last Supper at Brown's (Texas, 1864), Donoghue recreates the day when Mrs Brown ran off with the last household black servant, Negro Brown, after Marse Brown, head of the household and a man much disliked, decides to sell him. Mrs Brown sees her own opportunity to leave him when Brown tells her his intention to run away, and is complicit in the plan to make sure Marse can't follow them.Jane Johnson and her children are on their way to rejoin her husband, Henry, in Montreal in \"Counting the Days\" (Gulf of Saint Lawrence, 1849). Treasured letters, much read, link them together across the seas, but Jane is unaware that on the day she arrives, Henry fell ill with cholera and she's all alone, again.Two young, inexperienced gold prospectors in \"Snowblind\" (The Yukon, 1896), struggle through their first winter in their hut beside a creek, scrounging for gold dust. Stories of people striking big come in often enough to motivate everyone to keep at it, despite the times they nearly die. This story is written without dialogue punctuation, and Donoghue writes so well, I never even noticed till now!In \"The Long Way Home\" (Wickenburg, Arizona, 1873), weather-beaten, trouser-wearing Mollie Sanger goes into the bar to drag out Jensen, who left his pregnant wife and children at their dig to spend their meagre gold haul on booze, ties him to his horse and takes him back. Mollie, like all the characters in Astray, was a real woman, and ended up in a mental institute, probably because of her habit of wearing men's clothes.The plot to abduct Abraham Lincoln's body from his tomb to hold for ransom against the release of a master counterfeiter from jail is the object of \"The Body Swap\" (Chicago, 1876); little does the small group of men know but not all of them can be trusted. The details of what happened to the characters, in particular Morrissey, after the events of this story are as interesting as the story itself.If there was one story that made me want to cry more than all the others, it was \"The Gift\" (Jersey City, 1877). A common practice of the time was to leave young children with the Children's Aid Society when a family fell on hard times; the CAS would adopt the children out to prosperous families in the country, never mind that the parents want the children back. Sarah Bell is a widow struggling to provide for her baby, Lily May Bell. Her attempts to get the child back, especially after she's been farmed out to Mr and Mrs Bassett, a sheriff and his wife, become increasingly desperate as the years go by. Told in letters from Sarah and Mr Basset, the story of Lily May who never knew her real mother really tore at my gut.In \"The Lost Seed\" (Cape Cod, 1639), we read the words of Richard Berry, who writes in the margins of his Bible, speaking of the sin and fornication he sees around him in his Puritan settlement, the people he denounces for wickedness, until eventually he recognises that it is he who, sexually repressed, yearns for a man's touch. This is a finely tuned story, another voice cunningly wrought, a place and time skilfully rendered. Benjamin Hammon said to Teague Joanes that Sarah Norman told his wife I was an old killjoy.It matters not.Sin creeps around like a fog in the night. Too many of us forget to be watchful. Too many have left their doors open to for the Tempter to slip in. I puzzle over it as I lie on my bed in the darkness, but I cannot telly why stinking lusts and things fearful to name should arise so commonly among us. It may be that our strict laws stop up the channel of wickedness, but it searches everywhere and at last breaks out worse than before.I consider it my pressing business to stand sentry. Where vice crawls out of the shadows, I shine a light on it. Death still seizes so many of our flock each winter, we cannot spare a single soul among the survivors. Better I should anger my neighbor than stand by and watch the Tempter puck up his soul as the eagle fastens on the lamb. Better I should be spurned and despised, and feel myself to be entirely alone on this earth, than that I should relinquish my holy labor. They call me killjoy, but let them tell me this, what business have with joy? What time have we to spare for joy, and what have we done to deserve it? [pp.180-181]\"Vanitas\" takes us VAcherie, Louisiana in 1839, where fourteen year old Aim\u00e9e wiles away her days on the family plantation, stealing up to the attic between lessons with her Tante Fanny, where she discovers a trunk of exquisite dresses that once belonged to her cousin Eliza, who died while on holiday in France. The truth of what happened to Eliza and why her aunt never leaves her room is life-changing for Aim\u00e9e.In \"The Hunt\" (Hopewell, New Jersey, 1776), we learn about the practice of the European soldiers of raping - often en masse - the girls and women of the area, through the eyes of a fifteen year old soldier from Germany, who is being forced to prove himself a man by forcing a woman. As one of the soldiers puts it, \"I hate the thought of leaving a single maidenhead in the fucking State of New Jersey.\" (p.219) It's chilling, and as a woman, easily the scariest story here. I had no idea the practice was, well, a practice, and so systematic. The British troops certainly didn't win anyone over.When Doctor Gallagher dies, leaving his daughter Imelda \"Minnie\" Hall an orphan in \"Daddy's Girl\" (New York City, 1901), Minnie discovers that her father is not really her father at all. Perhaps he is actually her mother; they do share some features, after all. What's clear is that \"daddy\" is not a man, and Minnie is forced to rethink everything she thought she knew.In \"What Remains\" (Newmarket, Ontario, 1967), two once-renowned female artists originally from the States are spending their last days in a nursing home in Ontario. Florence Wyle does her best to help her close friend Queenie (France Loring) to remember the past, but the younger woman is senile and muddled as dementia sets in. It's left to Florence to recall their life together, since they met in a modelling class sixty years ago. When she recounted the commission Queenie worked on to mark the opening of the Queen Elizabeth Way (a major highway that goes through Toronto), I immediately perked up my mind. She carved a lifesize lion at the entrance - it has since been moved, and is now in the park between Lake Shore Road and the lake, but you can see it as you leave Lake Shore to get onto the QEW - and it is very impressive. I'm even more taken by it now I know a bit about who made it (when do we ever think about the artist behind a sculpture?).Lastly, in the Afterword, Donoghue takes us through each of the stories and their connection to her running theme, \"astray\". But at the end of each story is a passage explaining the inspiration behind the story, and filling in some of the gaps - like what happened to the people later.In each and every story, Donoghue displays her impressive literary talent, her ability at capturing unique voices, at sharing experiences in such a way that the people in these stories could be living and breathing right next to you as you read. Likewise I am impressed with the amount of research that must go into collections like this one, that covers different time periods - the historical details that enrich each story.Astray is a beautiful collection of stories that are both uplifting and grim - gritty in that way of realism without being constrained by it; showing the true human experience in so many forms, revealing that essential truism that our lives are vivid patchworks of joys and sorrows, hopes and fears. Whether you've been an immigrant yourself or not, you will be able to relate to these stories and characters, because threading its way through these stories that are at once familiar and strange, is that fine element of going astray, veering off course either through action or outside forces, of trying to find your way again, or a new way altogether. A must read for anyone looking for exceptional historical fiction by a truly gifted writer."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876124-bonnie", "userReview": "I did not realize what a phenomenal historical writer Donoghue is. She hits the timeperiod full-on. It\u2019s very David Mitchell-esque in its ability to really capture the voice of the period and not to feel anachronistic in the least bit. And I loved that all the short stories come from real historical events \u2013 either actual people or just an event that really happened. My favorites were: \u201cThe Gift\u201d (heartbreaking correspondence about a young mother forced to give up her child due to poverty but always planning to get her back, and the farming couple who adopt the child and raise her as their own after picking her up from an Orphan Train), \u201cDaddy\u2019s Girl\u201d (young woman finds out her father is actually a woman upon his death in 1901 NYC), and \u201cThe Lost Seed\u201d (an unreliable narrator \u2013 bitter, uptight, judgmental Puritan who accuses his neighbors of sins they did and did not commit; one of my favorites because the narrator is so awful but in a very intriguing way for a narrator\u2013 and he gets his come-uppance).There's a lot of tragedy (although also some happiness!) in these stories, but the most brutal for me was \u201cThe Hunt,\u201d which was about British soldiers committing systematic rape of the local women during the Revolution.It\u2019s incredibly impressive what Donoghue does \u2013 she crosses times and locations all over the US and Canada, from the 17th to the 20th century.

A few are from the other type of news, surprising deceptions carried out on an individual or group. I did feel a bit of distance from most of the stories, even as I enjoyed them, but a few were very moving, particularly those in the last section of the book.

And I'm glad I did. This collection is not to be missed.The book is broken into three parts: part 1 is stories about people that are about to embark on a journey, part 2 is stories about people that are in transit of a journey, and part 3 is stories about people that are concluding a journey. The stories are historical in that they are based in historical fact and are told over a wide range of eras. The earliest story, about a zealous tattler who accuses everyone around him of homosexual acts only to learn that he himself is closeted, is set in 1639. The latest story is set in Toronto (New Market, specifically) in the 1960's.The subject matter runs the gamut in this book. There is the story of a slave that tricks his master and runs away with his master's wife. There is a story set during the Yukon gold-rush which is actually a love story between two miners... reminded me of a colder \"Brokeback Mountain\". There is a rather disturbing tale set during the War of independence that reveals how the systematic rape of women was a key \"strategy\" that the British used to fight their war on the rebels. But I think two stories stood out the most for me. The first story int he collection is told from the perspective of the man that cared for Jumbo the elephant in Britain, before the animal was sold to Barnum. I liked this story because it makes the reader a character in the story, and the character you play is.... the elephant! The second story which really stood out for me was \"Daddy's Girl\" in which a young lady is mourning over the body of her dead father, the very famous democrat, Murray Hall, whom, posthumously, was revealed to be a woman.Each story is followed-up with a quick postscript that explains the historical accuracy of the preceding story and provides further context to why the author chose to tell the story.Ultimately, Emma Donoghue is a brilliant writer. Each story has a nugget of mystery at its core, and most of the stories are told from an unconventional perspective which draws the reader in.... again, I am thinking of the Jumbo the Elephant story. Her unique voice and style puts Emma Donoghue at the top of her writing class. The stories in this volume are so finely crafted, that readers may have difficulty putting the book down once it is opened.

I will definitely be spending some time researching some of the information/sources that the author based her stories off. *Some Spoliers* Man and Boy: Jumbo the elephant and his loving zoo keeper are about to travel to the US. Onward: A lovely story of second chances and a promise of a clean slate through immigration. The Widow's Cruse: The widow is not what she seems and plays the lawyer beautifully. Although you never find out why she did it- I was rooting for her to escape. Last Supper at Brown's: Another story of an unlikely duo getting away with a crime. Counting The Days: So, so sad. The couple was so close to being reunited and there was no way to get a message to the wife to tell her what happened. The letters between the two showed both a loving but realistic marriage. Snowblind: A Yukon Brokeback Mountain story. The Long Way Home: A melancholy story of the limited options many women had and how they suffered because of their men's choices. At first I misinterpreted the last scene between Mollie and Jensen, but even after I understood, I didn't know why Mollie would want that. The Body Swap: A crime against President Lincoln's tomb is thwarted. The Gift: Heartbreaking story about adoption through the Orphan Trains. I saw both parent's perspectives and had sympathy for both view points. The Lost Seed: Plymouth era story of a closeted gay man who projected sins onto others and tried to cast blame on them. Vanitas: Selfish, selfish family. I cringed at the breeding comment about the slaves they owned. The Hunt: This was the most difficult story to read for it was about systematic rape that some English soldiers inflicted on women in NJ during the Revolutionary War. The men were a pack of rabid dogs and no one in command stopped them -sickening but historically accurate. Daddy's Girl: How did any one not know? What Remains: A long-term friendship between female artists and the partnership they forged ends when one of them 'leaves' through her dementia."}, {"userName": "Meg - A Bookish Affair", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132408-meg---a-bookish-affair", "userReview": "3.5 stars. I was really excited for this book! Donoghue's \"Room\" was one of my favorite reads last year so when I heard that Donoghue's Astray was coming out, I knew that I had to read this book. Now short stories are not usually my favorite but because of the writing in \"Room,\" I gave this book a shot. I was definitely pleased and I know that in the future, Emma Donoghue will continue to be on my must read. Now to go back and read her backlist...This book is all about journeys of all different kinds. The stories take place across all different times and different places. What I found really interesting is that after each story, there is a small sort of \"afterword\" about where Donoghue found the inspiration to write each different story. I often find myself wondering where authors come up with their stories so I loved each of these \"afterwords.\" Perhaps even more interesting is that most of the stories are rooted in non-fiction stories.The writing that drew me in to \"Room\" was still present in \"Astray\" but this is a very different book. I liked some of the stories better than others. All of the stories are very different from each other and there are not really any connections between them other than the theme of journeys. I wish there had been more ties between the different stories. One of the most interesting to me was about a woman who is forced to give up her daughter due to really terrible life circumstances. Her daughter goes to the orphanage and then on one of the orphan trains that were so popular long ago. The mother keeps up a correspondence with the people who ran the orphanage to try to get news about her daughter throughout her life to no avail. It was very sad!Bottom line: Good writing!"}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "I loved this book. I'm a short story fan. In the hands of a capable writer, they are a form that can produce a great impact. Emma Donoghue is a more than competent writer, and the stories in this book are absolutely brilliant. Astray is about drifters, people who are floating through their lives, arriving to or departing from places. Donoghue herself is an immigrant, so it makes sense that she would pick people who don't belong anywhere to headline her stories. The characters are interesting without fail, the language exquisite, and the emotion depicted real. What makes the collection special is that Donoghue bases her stories on factual, documented accounts, and at the end of each story provides a historical note. I got a kick out of the notes as much as I enjoyed the stories themselves.My absolute favorite is \"The Hunt\", set in New Jersey circa 1776. A young German soldier is fighting for the redcoats for nothing but the coat and boots. His fellow redcoats rove the country searching for women to rape. He resists, and has noble intentions towards a girl he finds hiding in a farmhouse, but for how long? The final passage is quietly devastating. The stories \"Counting the Days\", where a young wife travels from a potato blight struck Ireland to Canada to meet her husband, who is impatiently waiting for her before tragedy strikes, and \"Vanitas\", where a young girl tries to understand the price to pay for vanity, are equally amazing."}, {"userName": "Magdelanye", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5208681-magdelanye", "userReview": "In each of these 14 historically dated stories of people in various stages of transition, ED has taken as her inspiration the often slender documentation of their passage in newpapers and magazine references. A few of the stories that have more extensive documentation seem the most far-fetched, like the first story which tells of the bull elephant Jumbo and his mahoot, and Daddy's girl (Oh, Daddy, was any of it true?) A few of the stories are apocryphal, and these are the most disturbing stories of all.In fact, I hated three of these stories, but they may be the most important. ED does seem to love to disturb. Her penchant for the oft-derided and misunderstood characters allows the reader to see through their eyes and her concise portraits give much food for thought.The result here is a fascinating stew of experience dished out with fearless candor and a generous empathy."}, {"userName": "Tuck", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565487-tuck", "userReview": "ripped straight from the local museum newsletter in prescott arizona and the headlines of london 1898 newspapers, very put-together short stories all based on quirky or affecting historical happenings, like jumbo moving to nyc, Tammany hall big wheel who was really a woman in disguise, and child soldiers raping and pillaging in 1776 new jersey. i predict donoghue wins the biggest awards with her next novel."}, {"userName": "Ruth Seeley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3303646-ruth-seeley", "userReview": "This book of historical documentary fiction - a series of short stories imagining the lives and significant events of real lives - has redeemed Emma Donoghue for me as a writer (wasn't a big fan of Room at all).

For example, in Empire of Dust: Settling and Abandoning the Prairie Dry Belt David C. Jones recounts the story of a woman settler whose husband died while he was digging a well for their homestead. The nearest water was was several miles away, and she had two small children that she would lock in the house while she walked to fetch water. One day, while she was gone, the children upset the syrup bucket, and made an incredible mess. (Can you imagine cleaning the up when you had to walk miles for water??) From then on, she would tie them to chairs so they wouldn't make a mess while she was gone. It was dangerous though, because they couldn't escape from rattlesnakes if any got into the house. Still, it seemed the most prudent thing to do.I would love to know more about that woman. Where did she come from? What was she expecting to find in her new home in Alberta? How did she live through losing a husband and living completely alone except for two totally dependent children without breaking down?Anyway, it seems like Emma Donoghue might share my curiosities. This book of short stories explores moments of history through the minutiae many of us leave behind. Using newspaper clippings, autobiographies, and place, Donoghue takes a piece of the past and fleshes out a story. They're all very personal, digging into the mind and experience of the individual. I suppose my only complaint is that she didn't ask me which historical vignettes I wanted her to write."}, {"userName": "CaseyTheCanadianLesbrarian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10463035-caseythecanadianlesbrarian", "userReview": "London, ON-based Irish writer Emma Donoghue\u2019s Astray is nothing if not a diverse collection of short stories. Although each story is historical and has some kind of fact such as letters or newspaper articles that serve as a catalyst for Donoghue\u2019s imagination, the times, places, and contexts are about as far-reaching as you could imagine. One, for example, takes place in the seventeenth century Puritan America, whereas another is set in rural Ontario in 1967. I love the idea of taking brief mentions of eccentric characters in documents of the past and fleshing out and imagining their lives. In particular, Donoghue focuses, as the book\u2019s title suggests, on characters who are on the move and out of place. However, what happened as I read through this assortment of stories is that I discovered I often liked the concept of what Donoghue was doing more than the execution\u2014in other words, the stories themselves...See the rest of my review on my website: http://caseythecanadianlesbrarian.wor..."}, {"userName": "Tracy Hanson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5109099-tracy-hanson", "userReview": "Definitely one of the best story collections I've read. I sometimes find with story collections there are stories I love, ones I think are \"OK\", and others I don't particularly like. Not in this case. Every single story is brilliant in its own way. There is enough variety in Astray to keep everyone happy. I particularly liked the last one which is a particularly interesting read considering the choice of characters (shall allow people to read that and judge what I mean). I loved the opening story about the elephant, it was touching to read. There are characters in very story which the author has got into the heart of and they all seem \"real\" and not just a \"person in a book\". Loved the use of the different characters in different places and circumstances. I loved the \"Afterword\" and am almost tempted to say \"read the Afterword first\" as it explains a lot. Enjoyed the historical details in the stories and it showed they were well researched and made the stories interesting and you weren't bombarded with facts and figures.Will definitely be reading more of this author's work and highly recommend anyone wanting an interesting read."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931709-katie", "userReview": "I have to say that I really hated Room, but after making a book discussion guide for it, I had a feeling that I would really enjoy some of Emma Donughue's other work, and I was right.Astray appealed to my archivist tendencies. She sourced each story from a little snippet of history - a letter, a newspaper clipping, or the mention of a historical figure in a book. While many of the characters were real people, little about them was known. It was completely obvious to me that she delighted in the research for these stories, as they were well thought out, yet didn't get caught up in the details and the exact recreation of the language of the time (ahem Caleb's Crossing, ahem).

They travel for love or money, incognito or under duress.With rich historical detail, the celebrated author of Room takes us from puritan Massachusetts to revolutionary New Jersey, antebellum Louisiana to the Toronto highway, lighting up four centuries of wanderings that have profound echoes in the present.
