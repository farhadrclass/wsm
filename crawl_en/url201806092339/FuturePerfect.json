Do not give them that foothold.She\u2019s not wrong. There really are people in the world who have ready a list of adjectives about a fat person\u2014including lazy, stupid, messy, incompetent\u2014that they are certain describes her before she ever opens her mouth. And that is unimportant, because I won\u2019t let it be important.\nThis is a beautiful, touching book that deals with body image, and the issues in it are things I think all women (and some men, although they won't admit it!) will understand and relate to. What I love about it is that it addresses the concept of perception. Like it or not, society has a negative perception about people who are overweight. The main character is a wonderfully strong and smart person, but people will not always see that when they look at her, due to her being overweight. Her grandmother is aware of that societal prejudice, she does not want anything to hold her granddaughter down. First impressions matter, and appearance matters, however sad the reality is.\nI run through the idea, the seductive, twining, choking-vine idea that everything could be easier. Everything could be simpler. That I never have to feel like this again. That skinny is so much easier than fat.\nAshley Perkins is fucking awesome, and she knows it.\nI am also valedictorian, class president, former volleyball team captain, and was voted both Most Likely to Succeed and Best Personality two years in a row in our school\u2019s yearbook, which is really more of a pamphlet. I scored the winning point during the state volleyball finals last year. Unfortunately it was because I spiked the ball into the face of our rival captain, but still. I have a Platinum Star (which is an A plus at normal, less weird schools) in AP Organic Chemistry.\nAP Organic Chem! That's some serious smarts right there (from a person who has gotten...not quite an A in Organic Chemistry). So she's smart, she's popular, she's fantastic! But she also has a grandmother who only sees one thing about her...She's fat. And her ever-loving, ever-concerned grandmother feels like that is the one thing she should focus on changing, because that's the one thing that initially matters.\nBut my grandmother thinks that not being fat is the part of me I should focus on. That being a size 18 (or sometimes 20) will ruin my life. She says, \u201cYou do not deserve to be automatically dismissed for utterly arbitrary aesthetic reasons that have nothing to do with your worth as a human being.\u201d\nHer grandmother is not some random, cranky old grandma, she's as perfect of a person as one could ever expect. Her grandmother is perfect. Beautiful, elegant, smart...she's a surgeon, for god's sakes. As much as Ashley doesn't want to listen to her grandmother, her words are hard to ignore. Ashley was never even aware that she was anything but normal until her grandmother mentioned it to her when she was thirteen.\nThat\u2019s when the word fat became something real. Something that would follow along behind me and settle in dark corners and slither around the back corridors of my mind. Whether or not I acknowledged it, the idea was inside me.For my birthday that year, she gave me my body. Or her idea of it.\nEvery year since, on her birthday, her grandmother has given her a coupon good for one shopping trip per every 10 pounds lost. Every year, the bribes increase in value, from a shopping trip to a trip in Paris, to a new car. But this year's gift...and bribe, trumps them all.\nAshley Maria Perkins. Weight-loss surgery in exchange for four years of tuition at Harvard University.\nHarvard University is her dream come true. Seemingly, weight loss surgery is an easy way out.\nA dieter can try and a dieter can fail\u2014and does most of the time\u2014and dieting doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s more than calories in and calories out, these journals tell me. Dieting doesn\u2019t work but it\u2019s not the dieter\u2019s fault that they\u2019re weak. And it\u2019s not the fat person\u2019s fault they\u2019re fat. But that can be fixed and that can be rearranged\u2014literally\u2014and everything and everyone can live happily ever after.\nAs much as she doesn't want to change herself, as much as she doesn't feel the need to conform to what her grandmother feels she should look like, an idea once implanted, will take seed, and that idea keeps nagging and bothering Ashley. Is losing weight really that bad? What is she willing to do to reach her dreams? In making her decision, Ashley is going to have to confront some demons within herself.\nHaving to prove myself, over and over.I have never allowed myself to acknowledge this, not really. More important, no one was ever supposed to know. Somehow, I really believed no one ever suspected I had this frantic, terrified center, a churning, overheating engine constantly propelling me forward. The energy behind everything I do. Everything I am.\nI like that her grandmother is not a villain. She is strict and adamant in her beliefs, but while unreasonable, she is not evil. She is a perfectionist, she has only the best intentions, and she has a heart, we see it, especially when she is dealing with Ashley's friend Jolene. She is cruel at times, but I feel like she is unintentionally so, with the kind of ignorance that comes with thinking \"I'm only doing this for your sake.\" Her cruelty isn't so cruel as it is, more or less, a well-intentioned love of sorts, however ignorant.\nShe checks her lipstick in the rearview mirror, and then smiles at me again. \u201cYou finally know how important this is. You\u2019re better than your mother ever was, and I am determined to give you every possible advantage.\u201d She opens her door and slips out, taps up the stone path in her kitten heels.\nIn case I haven't made this clear throughout my review, I thought this book was fantastic. It was well-written, the main character is just a person. Weight is always a sensitive issue and this book never made me feel like I was reading a book about a fat girl. She is a person before she is her size, she is not defined by her size. She is defiant, funny, interesting, not a pitiful character by any means. This book makes the main character a strong person by her own rights, it makes her personality, what drives her, a more significant issue than her weight. This is not a book about losing weight, it's a book about finding yourself.All quotes were taken from an uncorrected proof subject to change in the final edition."}, {"userName": "aria [dear darling reader]", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5769334-aria-dear-darling-reader", "userReview": "I WOULD LIKE TO THANK HARPER TEEN FOR PROVIDING THIS eARC IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.\n\n\"Nothing will get easier. And nothing will be better. Don\u2019t change your mind.\"\n\nI don't think I've read any books that dealt with the subject of self-image and acceptance. And now I realize how much I should try and read more about the subject because I have been struggling with a similar problem.I thought this book touched on the subject pretty well. It was a delicate subject that was handled in a way that wasn't preachy. It was done in such a way that you'd take something out from the story while at the same time enjoying the book.\nTHE GIST\n\n\n\"Every year on my birthday, my grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, the woman we owe our whole lives to, reminds me that I am risking everything.\"\n\nAshley Maria Perkins is fat. Or at least that's what her grandmother thinks.\n\n\"The issue, my grandmother will be quick to tell you, is that I am fat.\"\n\nShe knows she isn't skinny, but she was okay with that. She is fine with the fact that she is on the heavier side. She knows she's amazing because there's a lot of things she could do. She believes in herself. She doesn't understand why her grandmother could not see how being skinny wasn't at all important to her.Her grandmother always gives here these cards wherein she gives her something in exchange for losing weight. She didn't really care about them. She always declined.At least, until her grandmother gave her something that she really really wants.\nTHE PROTAGONIST\nAshleyI really liked Ashley's character. She is confident, smart, and knows what she wants in life. She is something I am not.I have been described as ambitious, smart, outgoing, driven, stubborn, and sometimes bossy by people who love me, though that last one is not true. I\u2019ve also been described as fat by my grandmother and select others, which is true.\n\nI've always been an insecure girl. I have a lot of issues with how I look like. Especially how much I weigh. I always find something wrong with myself, even with the smallest things that no one else really cares about. So when I read this book, I realized how badly I've been treating myself. How I should be more confident with what I have and who I am.\n\nEven when she was on the heavier side, Ashley didn't take crap from anyone. There's this girl who always tease her about her weight, but she doesn't take that shit from her. She doesn't allow the bitch to reign over her. She have friends who love her and support her but she doesn't need them to defend her. She is more than capable of doing so herself. And I envy her of that. There was a time though when she was at her weakest (who doesn't though). When she almost gave in to what she doesn't want to do, to get what she wants the most. But she realized what is really more important.Ashley's an amazing character and I love reading her perspective. I wish I could be more like her.\nROMANCE\nRomance did not have a big part in this story. Thank heavens. It played a very tiny role. I thought there was going to be cheating but I was so wrong. I'm glad the romance part turned out the way it did. It was unexpected. I thought it was the best way to go about with the story.\nPLOT DEVELOPMENT\nI liked how the story went. The plot was pretty easy to follow and straight to the point. This was a book about self acceptance and that is what we got. There were minor subplots with Ashley's friend Laura and Jolene, but all of them had to deal with the central theme of the story so it does not take away anything from the main story line.\nQUOTABLE QUOTES\n\u201cYou do not deserve to be automatically dismissed for utterly arbitrary aesthetic reasons that have nothing to do with your worth as a human being.\u201d\u00a0\"Your body isn\u2019t her business.\u201d\u00a0\"I am the sum of my parts. Everything I\u2019ve ever done and everything I\u2019ve ever achieved and everything I have ever been. Fat and smart and afraid and fierce and angry and brave all together right here, and every piece of the puzzle fits the way it\u2019s supposed to and I can\u2019t pretend anymore. It\u2019s always been true, no matter what I\u2019ve told myself or hoped or tried to believe.\"\u00a0\nTHINGS I LIKED\n  The story itself was something I easily could relate to and a lot of people would be able to relate to. Maybe not with Ashley's character, but maybe with Jolene or Laura. \n   I liked Ashley's character. She was as real as you can get. There was nothing fake about her. All her reactions to the things she went through were realistic. \n   The writing is very easy to get through. \n   There are some great lines on this book. \n   Ashley's grandmother is also a great character. She wasn't exactly an antagonist because you understand why she does the things she does. I think that's very important. \n   No fucking instalove. Romance is not a key player in this story. It focused more on the friendship than the romance. \n   The cover is so cute. \n   How realistic the topic this book touched on. \n   \nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE\n  Probably the slower parts. But there wasn't a lot of them \n   Although I don't hate her Grandmother, I despise the way she treats Ashley. She was forcing her to do the thing she wants her to do by blackmailing her into giving her something she wants. I get that it happens. But come on. Give the girl some slack. She is doing the best she can with her life and you have to go around and point out to her that she will never get anywhere because she's fat. Come on lady. So not cool. \n   \nFINAL WORDS\nI was cheering Ashley the entire time while reading this. She doesn't deserve the crap that her grandmother is putting her through. She owes her a lot, but damn, she has to live her own life the way she wants to. It was unfair of her grandmother to blackmail her. But I know it happens not the exact way as it has in the book, but the part where kids or teens are not allowed to choose what they want to be. I could relate to that in a way.I loved this book. I would recommend it to everyone who would like a good contemporary read that would leave you with something to really think about."}, {"userName": "Jen Larsen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/607659-jen-larsen", "userReview": "In Future Perfect, Ashley is beautiful, confident, and fat.

First of all, I wanna banish the thought that books that are about fat protagonists is meant for people who are experiencing the same thing only. NO! I actually think that books like this are meant for everyone! Every gender, age group or whether you're experiencing the same thing or not. Everyone will finish this book with a powerful message received. And that is simply being happy and finding acceptance. That may seem very simple but Jen Larsen written it all in the most beautiful way. Ashley is very refreshing. Its great to be inside the head of a fat protagonist that is not unhappy or not feeling bad about the way she look. Ashley is smart, driven and most of all, she's real. She's like an eye opener to everyone who thinks that all fat people are miserable or sad about their life. Ashley tends to ramble though which is my least favorite thing because it makes the book slower for me to read. But other than that, Ashley is nothing but inspiring. She's admirable in every way and her character growth is just superb!  Other characters are completely well done as well and their subplots played a huge role in the story. Her grandmother which seems mean and the villain of the story is one of my favorite character. She's just so complex. I am really impressed by Jen Larsen's characterization and her writing. The story was set in a pace where you feel like you're jut there... with Ashley. You will sympathize, you will feel and you will also learn. Romance wasn't a huge part of the story but it was still there. I can't really say anything anymore except that it was not cliche and that it was just all...real. Overall, I highly recommend Future Perfect. It doesn't matter what kind of reader you are or that you feel like you've already read books like this before, YOU NEED THIS BOOK in your life."}, {"userName": "Shannon (It Starts At Midnight)", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8652150-shannon-it-starts-at-midnight", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on It Starts at Midnight Le sigh. I wanted to love this one\u00a0so much. The concept appealed to me on a ton of personal levels, and I was anxious to see what direction it took. I feel like some of the problems I had with the book are almost opposite of problems that others have had. For instance, I have seen a lot of reviewers completely shocked that a grandmother would bribe her granddaughter to lose weight. That didn't shock me in the least. In fact, I know a few of you knew about my BEA dilemma- that I hadn't lost enough weight for my mom to agree to pay for it- and how devastated I was, that even though I\u00a0had worked to lose it, it wasn't enough. So yeah. Ashley's story is a real thing, and it\u00a0does happen. If you are appalled by it,\u00a0good. Thank you. I appreciate your outrage. You're right!I enjoyed the setup of the book, basically. The part where we learn Ashley's history, the story behind her grandmother's ridiculousness, Ashley's perfectionism, her awesome friends, and her family dynamic, as well as the weight stuff.But then... I don't know, it really lost momentum along the way for me. The story took some kind of random, kind of ridiculous/unbelievable turns. I can't really say\u00a0what happens of course, but it didn't feel like it had much to do with the original story at hand.There was romance, but not a ton of it. There were two guys, but I assure you it was not a triangle, so that's good news. I just wasn't super invested in either one, but they were both pretty stand up, decent guys, so at least that part wasn't terribly annoying.My problem with this book was pretty much threefold: The aforementioned random plots. These really could have been left out and nothing would have been lost from the book. In fact, maybe had the random side plots been fewer, I would have had more of a connection to Ashley. Which I did not. \n  I got kind of bored/didn't care. It wasn't that I wasn't worried about the outcome it was just that it seemed to take a long time to get there. And I wasn't feeling much emotion from Ashley, which made it even harder for me to care about her. Like, I was genuinely more concerned about her friend than I was about Ashley for a good portion of the story, and I doubt that was the point. \n   (And this is kind of the biggest) I really don't see a physician in good standing even consenting to perform a bariatric surgery on a teenager with no other health problems who isn't even\u00a0that overweight. Add to that that it's abundantly clear that Ashley doesn't\u00a0want this surgery, and it would be even less likely. There's usually a significant amount of counseling to ensure patient cooperation and motivation. Proof? Yeah, I have that.\u00a0\nBottom Line:\n Look, I like what the author is trying to do here, and I absolutely agree that families can play huge (and often quite negative) roles in our self confidence, how we feel about our appearance, etc. I love that Ashley was so successful, and that we were taken on her journey. I just can't look past the meandering story and implausibilities.\u00a0*Copy provided by publisher for review"}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22104588-drew", "userReview": "\u201cWhy do you need to be different from how you are now?\u201d\nWith such an intriguing premise, I expected this book to be one of those wowing, spectacular reads. First of all, I want to applaud the author for writing about such a delicate topic, especially when it's one that affected her personally.Every year on her birthday, Ashley's grandmother gives her a card. Ashley has been promised dazzling presents ever since she was little, but the cost is always the same: In order to receive these gifts, she has to lose weight.Ashley has always accepted her size and always refuses her grandmother's \"birthday cards,\" but this year she is being offered something she can't turn away. Now she is torn between doing what she believes is right and giving in to her grandmother's demands to get weight loss surgery.The reason I couldn't connect with this book was because Ashley wasn't a very interesting character. In the beginning she was categorized by her friends as inspirational, bossy, sweet, and smart. But when I tried to get a sense of these qualities, there just wasn't much evidence to showcase it.What I really, really wanted was for this story to evoke sympathy from me and help me understand Ashley's emotional struggle. Instead I felt distant toward her, which resulted in me yawning when she was being mistreated because of her size, rather than making me angry or worried.Ashley actually had a nicely fleshed out character, but I felt like she was representing a problem bigger than the rest of her life. Instead of subtly inserting the issue of pressurized weight loss surgery, Ashley was her problem. This resulted in her character feeling bland and lifeless.If this book were a movie I would call it a documentary, as the story followed Ashley around mechanically. Facts were served up on a cold platter but there wasn't much emotion to go along with it.There were a couple other issues I had that I won't bother going in to, including a stereotypical mean girl and Ashley salivating over another guy when she already had a boyfriend.Over all I liked the message about how your body is your own and you don't need anyone else to \"approve\" it for you, but I'm afraid this powerful point was lost in a cast of dry characters and a plot lacking in excitement."}, {"userName": "Milka", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1982249-milka", "userReview": "\"I am the sum of my parts. Everything I've ever done and everything I've ever achieved and everything I have ever been. Fat and smart and afraid and fierce and angry and brave all together right here, and every piece of the puzzle fits the way it's supposed to and I can't pretend anymore.\" Future Perfect was a perfect example for me of a book that I had to form my own opinions of despite the somewhat mixed early reviews. I love Goodreads, but I feel like too often I rely too much on the ratings there. If something is rated below 3.5 I often decide to lose interest rather than make my own judgments. I am happy that I requested this one for review before I read any reviews because I felt obliged to read it because I definitely ended up liking this one A LOT more than I expected. For the past couple of years, Ashley has received a card from her grandmother. Though the text is different every year, the message is the same: lose some weight and I will buy you something that will make you happy. Ditching the previous cards has been somewhat easy for Ashley, but when on her 17th birthday she gets a card that could change everything for her, Ashley starts to think that maybe her grandmother is right. Maybe she can't find true happiness and respect if she is fat. Ever since Ashley was a little kid, she has dreamed of becoming a doctor and studying at Harvard. But tuition's not cheap, and when her grandmother gives her a card telling that if she agrees to go to a weight loss-surgery, she will get Harvard paid. Should Ashley see this as her savior, as something that makes her dream come true, or in fact, is it a bribe, something that makes her dream seem a little less, like something that she cannot reach as herself but as someone else. Though Ashley's grandmother sounds like a villain from your worst nightmares, I liked the fact that Larsen does not describe her as completely evil entity. The cards and the way the grandmother treats Ashley is veiled as her \"caring about\" Ashley, and as the book processes, in some weird way you can see the logic behind the actions. As a fat girl, as someone who has been told that life will be harder for me if I don't lose weight, I found the cards and the way Ashley is treated hurtful, much like Ashley herself. But I guess there's also a part of me that understand why someone would say that, especially someone from an older generation. So despite the fact that I did want to hate the grandmother, I couldn't do it without thinking about it more. One of the most interesting aspects of this novel are the supporting characters, especially Jolene, Ashley's transgender friend. It is with Jolene that we see a whole new side of Ashley's grandmother, who makes sure that Jolene can be whoever she wants to be despite the criticism and ignorance by Jolene's family. The problems Jolene goes through with her identity are somewhat mirrored with what Ashley goes through, but I did respect the distinctions between the two stories made by Larsen and somewhat through the character of Jolene herself - though both struggle with finding themselves and their place in the world, their situations are not the same. Ashley is an interesting character to read about. She is likable, but also does and says things that made me question her actions. She is struggling, confused and hurt, and sometimes that leads her to saying things that she would not necessarily say otherwise. I enjoyed the development Ashley goes through during the novel from someone who's very confused to someone who has an idea of who she is. The realization she goes through about her body and the way she presents herself to the world felt empowering in the sense that she learns that despite the opinions of others, it is okay for her to be herself.Like a good contemporary novel, Larsen's Future Perfect blends together family drama, friendships, self-discovery and growing up and a little bit of romance. Though I am all for romantic contemporaries, I liked the fact that this one focused more on Ashley and the other relationships in her life, most importantly the relationship she has with herself. Also, as a massive dog person, I loved how big of a role the dogs Ashley has were in this book. Future Perfect is a proof that dogs make everything better."}, {"userName": "Melissa Posten", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/241642-melissa-posten", "userReview": "Fantastic debut by someone who, I think, has a long future in YA."}, {"userName": "Bibi Rose", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6516706-bibi-rose", "userReview": "This is a WALLOP of a teen book and I can't wait to sell it!

The book takes you a LOT of places in 200 pages and reflects the way life starts zooming ahead at that age. I like it because it deal with issues but is not an \"issues book.\" A lot of it feels like attending a party-- hanging out with cool people who are characters with real depth. The voice is breezy and assured and very teenage. That made the profound betrayal-- horrible, but sadly realistic-- by some of the adults come as even more of a shock. But the main character's reaction to all of it feels very plausible.By the way, the book deals with weight issues but they are folded into typical high school academic, achievement and dating issues-- in addition to family issues-- in a way that I think will make it pretty universally appealing."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/913689-molly", "userReview": "Huge thank you to the publisher for letting me read an advanced copy of this bookWow this book took me by surprise! I actually liked it a lot more than another book that's coming out soon that is also about big girls and body positivity. First off I need to say that I've seen a lot of outraged reviews crying HOW CAN A LOVING GRANDMOTHER DO THIS TO HER GRANDCHILD?! Well... the Grandmother in this book is not the type of cookie baking, present giving, snuggly grandmother, Nana, Granny, what have you that comes to mind when you think \"Grandmother\". The Grandmother in this book is a hard, ambitious woman who grew up, worked and thrived in a world older than ours. With different expectations. In our more progressive, contemporary society body image and the fight for body positivity is NOTHING LIKE what this woman had to deal with. Grandmother is a female surgeon who succeeded in a field during a time when it was difficult for women to do so. And being pretty was a way to get ahead, gain respect, and be taken a little more seriously (I mean come on, this woman must have been working in the 70-80s!) So I think that if we take a moment to think about what Grandmother is REALLY like in this book then, yes, she COULD do this to her grandchild.Every year for her birthday Ashley, our MC, gets a card with a coupon in it from Grandmother. Lose 50 pounds and you get a new car. Lose 80 pounds and you get a shopping trip in Paris. Finally on her 17th birthday Ashley gets the ultimate coupon: get weight loss surgery and you get 4 full years of tuition to Harvard University. Harvard is Ashley's dream. She wants to be a doctor and she works hard to get in to such a prestigious school. Now Ashley is a big girl, but she's SUPER confident and okay with her body. She attends a small alternative school with her best friends and boyfriend, she's the Valedictorian, plays volleyball, and she's happy. Her home life could probably use some work (mother walked out on them, father is pretty hopeless, Grandmother takes care of them), but she's happy. And has no issue with her size. Until her Grandmother makes a point of it. Sure she confessed to her longtime crush and he turned her down because she \"wasn't his type\" and she knew he really just didn't want to date the fat chick, but she moved on!So when Ashley is presented with this ultimate choice she doesn't know what to do. Her friends are against it and Ashley doesn't want it. She doesn't understand why her Grandmother can't see that her weight is NOT holding her back. Grandmother thinks that people wont take Ashley seriously because of her weight, that they'll discredit her or not even give her the time of day. Grandmother thinks that being thin will get Ashley ahead. See what I mean by old fashioned thinking?Now, I was rooting for Ashley to do what she wanted. This book is about body positivity but it's also about CHOICES. And I liked that. Everyone has the right to choose what to do with their own body. Yes some people choose to treat their bodies like crap, but others choose to be happy in their skin no matter what their size. Or gender. See, there was this lovely transgender subplot that was so seamlessly woven in that it didn't even really register with me until like halfway through the book. One of Ashley's BFF's, Jolene, is transgender. Has been since 4th grade. And ironically her biggest supporter is GRANDMOTHER! I loved this so much. As old fashioned as the woman is, she just wants people to be happy in what she believes is their best body. And while she doesn't think that Ashley's size 20 is her best body, she does believe that Jolene being a girl rather than a boy is her best body. And she fights hard to protect Jolene from her awful parents. There's a very interesting juxtaposition between the two different types of body modification surgeries talked about in this book and Jolene's parents are pushing her to choose to move forward and do something about her ~transition~ and she's not sure if she wants to go through the physical surgical change and I loved so much how the message regarding both Ashley and Jolene was IT IS YOUR CHOICE AND NOBODY ELSES.So what does Ashley choose? Read the book, go on the adventure with her and her friends and find out! Explore her choices and root for how awesome she is because Ashley is an awesome girl!One final thing that I really enjoyed about this book was the writing! It was so full of energy and a bit frantic at times and I just really enjoyed all the little things, the character quirks, ALL THE CUTE PUPPIES. Yes. ALL. THE. CUTE. PUPPIES."}, {"userName": "Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2614253-brandi-kosiner-brandi-breathes-books", "userReview": "3.5 stars (liked it a lot) I wanted to read Future Perfect because the premise. Her grandmother offers big incentives to try to get Ashley to lose weight, and a college ride, this year's offer, is extremely hard to pass up. But Ashley is okay with how she looks, she knows she is bigger than the average person, but she is smart, funny, and motivated, and she wants that to be enough.  I am a larger person, and I do not have near the confidence and acceptance of my body as Ashley does. And I think that is a beautiful message-- weight just being a number, and really accepting that what makes you who you are is on the inside, your personality, and your drive in life, and she doesn't want to let what is on the outside, her size 20 to define her. But she faces pressure from all sides, her friends, teachers, her grandma to accept this. She understands they are just trying to help, but that is a hard thing when no one seems to be able to just let it go, and love her for who she is, not what she looks like.  I liked how she was strong, and put on her brave face. Ashley surrounded herself with her friends, and family, and she is able to stay pretty confident about who she is. She is a people pleaser when it comes to her grandmother, and it turns out that she feels obligation to her because of how much she has done for her dad, her and her brothers. I appreciate that at one point, she tried to see it from her grandma's point of view as well as how it might change her health and future. But she realized a lot about herself, and that it is okay for her to stand up for it.  The premise played out well, and I liked how the romance wasn't the main thing. She does have a boyfriend, and I appreciate that he didn't seem to care about her size, rather who she is and her personality. Rather, her friendships and family as well as her college dreams and decision about her birthday proposition.  While it dealt with some heavy issues, it didn't get bogged down. It was all about the characters and their development.  The ending was well done, and I liked the way Ashley made decisions for her best future.

When Ashley\u2019s own grandmother bribes her with things like cars to lose weight, Ashley doesn\u2019t give in or let it get to her. I really admired this about her, because a lot of YA books have weak characters that give in to harassment, which can be a bit irritating. Characters that are strong really make books relatable and enjoyable to read.Though I did enjoy the positive message and plucky main character, I really disliked Ashley\u2019s grandmother. It is not okay to bribe your own granddaughter to lose weight, especially when she rejects the offers many times. Because of this cruel character, Future Perfect wasn\u2019t as enjoyable as it could have been. It was a disappointing aspect of this story that really did not sit well with me.Future Perfect is so encouraging with its motivational message and a main character that is very confident about her body.

She doesn't explore alternative financing options - e.g. student loans - doesn't consider the possibility of other schools, and doens't really think of just telling her grandmother to sod off.

The story follows a girl named Ashley who is considered overweight, though that doesn't define her. She is valedictorian at her school and is on track to go to Harvard, so she has a lot going for her. She also has a boyfriend named Hector and the two of them are very cute together. However, every year on her birthday, Ashley's grandmother offers her a huge present in return for her losing some weight. One year she was even offered a car. This year, she is told that she could get full tuition to Harvard for four years (which she is in dire need of) if she gets weight loss surgery. News of this spreads around the school and the book is basically her deciding if she should do it or not.I really liked Ashley as a character. I think my favorite thing was that Ashley was very smart and realized that she was more than what she looked like, so I found her to be a very awesome person because of that. I liked her friends too; they were pretty sweet. I also really liked Hector. That being said, I absolutely hated her grandmother. It's cruel to bribe people to lose weight like that and it's just such a turn away because I'd never want someone in my life who acted like that. In the end, I found this book to be pretty enjoyable.

Remember when I reviewed Dumplin' and told everyone that \"I'm all for the YA literary trend that relates to perfectly imperfect characters such as Willowdean Dickson\"? It was actually from that realization that made me want to read Future Perfect, seeing that Ashley Perkins, the main character of this book, happens to be experiencing the same troubles that Willowdean did. She, too, was overweight and the story seems to revolve on that specific idea. I happen to love Dumplin', and I, too, happen to be overweight. That's what enticed me to read this book as well. One of the many reasons why I read books is that I want to relate to the characters that authors introduce me to. As for the case of Future Perfect and Ashley Perkins, it wasn't like that at all.I feel like there's too much conversation in this book and it led the story away from the reader. The author seems to have focused on writing a story based on conversations rather than giving due importance to other elements of a good story like actual character developments, mid-story plot twists, etc. I mean, most of the time, I personally tend to look for an actual dialogue so that I could vividly understand a story, but in the case of this book, there was just too much of that. Unnecessary little stories were written when there was no actual relation to the story. I don't know if I'm perfectly able to put my thoughts about this into writing, but, the point is there were just too many dialogues.As for the characters, I don't know if it's just me or there were also too much characters who I, as a reader, wasn't even introduced to. It was utterly confusing for me, since I didn't even know who the main character was talking to most of the time. I had to backtrack several times so that I could comprehend what was actually going on. This could have been great if the author tried a little harder to make her characters a little more identified.One more thing I want to add is that the premise of this book could have been great if the writing style was more vivid and creative. See, the story was about a girl who had it all: a brain, a social life, and even a boyfriend. Her only dilemma was that she was overweight. Now, I don't know about you guys but that to me seems like a great story in itself. The author just had to make things a little more interesting so as to keep the readers hooked up. Unfortunately, I wasn't kept interested enough to at least finish this book.But of course, that\u2019s just me. You could always check out Future Perfect by Jen Larsen and it may work out for you. It is already out, and you should check out your local book stores to see if they have it.

At times I struggled a bit with the story because of how it was a bit scattered and such, but it wasn't like that in a bad way, I feel like it totally fit in with the characters, and was how the story was meant to be told.

A GIVEAWAY OF THE BOOK AND OTHER AWESOME SWAG IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW, EVERYONE!  *3.5 star rating* Future Perfect blew me away in one of those ways that I wouldn't change for the world. It's life-changing, heartbreaking and too relatable to me that I can't think about anything else anymore. It's unique, though troubling at times, especially for the main character, Ashley, who is put under constant pressure of being manipulated to lose weight and lose all of her self-confidence that she continued to have throughout the book. It's pretty horrible to have someone at your side constantly putting you down and making sure that you are going to change somehow. I'm not saying that I've put in Ashley's situation\u2014no, never. But I'll tell you that I could relate to Ashley Ms. Overachiever than anyone else.Ashley's grandmother is a good person, but a total worrier about too much. Every year on Ashley's birthday, she offers her a new thing or gift to make her lose weight. Disneyland, a shopping trip to Paris, you name it. This year, on her latest birthday, her grandmother offers her full tuition to Harvard if she goes for weight loss surgery. Ashley's weight never bothered her, but things are getting weird as she knows that this is the only chance she'll get to fulfill her dreams. She's going to be a legacy at Harvard, since her mother went there and followed her dreams as well. But of course, things get in between which could damage that \"perfect future\" forever.\"My hands shake and I hate every tremor. She wants the whole world for me, and this is the only thing I have to give her in return. She tells me this without actually saying the words. This is the only change I have to make.\"Yes, this is the \"only change\" she has to make. At first, Ashley's transition begins as a small thing that doesn't seem like a big deal. She initially doesn't get the message that her grandmother is practically tormenting her in embarrassment that her granddaughter is overweight and needs to change her image. It's like bribery and blackmailing\u2014that's what this book has. It's horrible in Ashley's situation, but it's amazing for readers since we were given the chance to read about such a pleasureful story that we won't ever be given the chance to read about again in the near future. There's no book out like this in the world, that's for sure.I'm an overachiever, and kind of proud? Ashley has dreams, she wants to be a doctor and attend a good school. That's kind of what I've been beginning to think about, and I spent the summer researching and going crazy about what I'd like to do. It's a crazy deal that Ashley's grandmother has put Ashley in, but I kind of get it. It's not right for a family member, or anyone to be tormenting you, making deals with you to change your image. It's not like Ashley has any kind of a horrible personality. No. She's happy, and that makes readers and everyone happy. She's not a miserable protagonist, she's living life and doing the things that everyone should do, like a bucket list in a way, except it's one before college. This doesn't have any romance at all. At least, not really. Ashley does have a boyfriend, whose name I won't mention because some spoilers could absolutely sprout up out of nowhere. But I'll tell you\u2014she doesn't deserve to be treated the way she was by her friends, acquaintances and everyone around her. To be honest, her family was the worst out of everyone, which isn't just at all. \"Everything here is familiar. It is easy to settle into the things I know and the things I understand. Things that are real, unequivocal. Things that can't be broken.\"I'm so proud of this whole novel because it hits readers' hearts. I can't stop thinking about it, smiling over the little lines and phrases that Jen Larsen provided us with, and I need more. More about this subject and more contemporary that focuses on so much more than your average, ordinary tale. The plot is fast-paced here and there, but it slows down. That's my only complaint, but I'd rather not focus on that since everyone could have a different opinion on that. The most important thing to me is that there's feels sprouting up from me and that I feel like this story could influence others and make them happy, even if there are some unfair and sorrowful parts of it.I'm now happy and could call this a success because Ashley turned out to be happy. \nI've been waiting for this book for ages, and I feel have read it and am satisfied.\n Future Perfect is everything you've been waiting for this whole year, and after it, you'll just expect more to be flying towards you. Standalones hit me hard when they're looked upon at with tough subjects, but this was definitely a more positive, different look at teenagers stuck in the situation of being \"fat.\" Some things are only stereotypes, but this book screws the stereotypes and goes through a new perspective that's worth reading and waiting for."}, {"userName": "Rabiah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3177566-rabiah", "userReview": "**3/3.5 stars**Originally posted at: http://iliveforreading.blogspot.com/2...I don't think I've read a young adult novel that features a larger protagonist and focuses on weight-loss before! This was as interesting topic at hand for me, particularly because I'm definitely a larger girl, and it's sad that I really haven't explored this topic in fiction. Future Perfect seemed like a great book, but while I did love the core of the story, I had a few issues with the plot.Some of the story was pretty unnecessary. I almost felt like giving up at points, but I really wanted to find out what Ashley decides to do in the end, which is why I kept on going. It was an intriguing read, but sooooo much filler. The weight-related content was good. A-plus reading! The other stuff just felt like the author was trying to unnecessarily drag on the book for a while. Like the party scene? While, like, one part of it was totally related to the plot, it just...didn't seem to fit with the message of the book. It actually made me not like Ashley, Jolene and Laura's characters all too much.The characters were really diverse though. Not only do you have an overweight half-white half-Latina character, you also have Jolene, who is transgender, and Laura, who is black. A great cast of characters for sure. And all super complicated too. I was on the fence between liking them and despising them though, because I would often get annoyed at how adamant and snappish they were towards each other, as well as the whole escapade they get into as mentioned above. Friends help friends! Friends don't flake out or take it out on others without good reason. Ashley's grandma was probably my favourite character, because despite the terrible bribery on her part, she's such a good person. Ashley herself is a pretty good character\u2013I liked her conviction and strength, as well as her weaknesses and vulnerable side. This girl doesn't let her weight alter her outlook on life, and she's top of the class and knows how to hold her place.With Future Perfect, I wish two aspects were examined further. One is family, because I mean, her mom leaving was a pretty big part of her life, but I felt the book didn't go too much into it for some reason. While I liked that it didn't take over the entire plot, I just felt that it was somewhat incomplete. Second aspect? Romance. It kind of leaned more towards the filler part of the novel, because some of it was unnecessary and it unbalanced the plot a teeny tiny bit. However, I did love that it completely ruined the ugly opinion that some people have, which is that fat girls can't find love. Um, excuse me? WE TOTALLY CAN. Ashley proves it, amongst the bajillion other \"fat\" girls who supposedly can't get with a guy because of their size.Inspirational and moving, Future Perfect, amidst its flaws, was powerful at the core. It brings me so much joy to see a protagonist, labelled a \"fat\" girl, accomplish and do so much, despite the negative opinions directed at her and her body. Jen Larsen delivers a strong message about body positivity, which, despite my hesitancy to like the story in its entirety, makes this an important novel for young adult readers."}], "description": "Every year on her birthday, Ashley Perkins gets a card from her grandmother\u2014a card that always contains a promise: lose enough weight, and I will buy your happiness.Ashley doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with the way she looks, but no amount of arguing can persuade her grandmother that \u201cfat\u201d isn\u2019t a dirty word\u2014that Ashley is happy with her life, and her body, as it is.But Ashley wasn\u2019t counting on having her dreams served up on a silver platter at her latest birthday party.
