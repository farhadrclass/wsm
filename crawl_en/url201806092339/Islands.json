People must have bought it for the author's name.This is the second Siddons book I've read. I wasn't pleased with the first either. When the story started out in \"Islands\" I thought it had potential. I was in the world of Charleston and I learned a few things yet never quite felt I was \"in\" the lives. I liked the idea of the \"Scrubs\" - of a group of friends who became family and vowed to stay together and take care of each other. But the idea fell short. When the story began to unravel and the reader realizes that this group who seems untouchable and a bit unreal is in fact touchable and very much real - it was a let down. The way their threads unraveled all the more was even more of a let down. (There were several let downs for me in this book - the biggest of all the ending) I read another review where it spoke of little character detail. I agree with this very much. We really never got into the minds of the characters. Overall, the book was a struggle to read and a struggle to finish. I was quite disappointed by the \"surprise\" ending and the way it just popped up. For me, the book was a somber tale of could be friendship with very little substance."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike", "userReview": "So, how do you write a review for a book for whom you clearly weren\u2019t the intended audience, but you read it anyway? I read it because I was curious about the genre, even though I can\u2019t really say what the genre is. I\u2019m not even sure I know what the theme of the book was. It seems, on the surface, to be about the very ordinary lives of members of Charleston\u2019s privileged society. When I was growing up, one of the favorite jokes in my house was how unrealistic television families were. But, we\u2019d always counter, who would want to watch shows about normal people? The same thing applies to this book, why would anyone want to read a book about such normal people, as they lead their normal lives? They are loyal, or they have affairs. They survive hurricanes, and rebuild, or not. They mourn their dogs. They age. They drift apart and come together. The only conclusion I can come to is that the book is about feelings. This is the ultimate book of introspection, and if you\u2019re really interested in how really ordinary people are feeling about everything and everybody, you might like this book. On the other hand, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time I totally missed the point of a book.I must say something about the writing. I never realized how sensitive I am to an author using the same phrase more than once in a book, probably because no other author has tested me this way. You wouldn\u2019t think that out of the thousands of words in a book, you\u2019d remember every one, but I think you do. In this book the author repeats her words, and it\u2019s grating. The first time I read that someone felt \u201cobscurely angry\u201d, I was just puzzled, but when I read later someone was \u201cobscurely fearful\u201d, it bothered me. Same for \u201cwith every atom of her body\u201d, \u201cshe was a Lolita\u201d, and his heart was \u201chammering\u201d."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2247257-dana", "userReview": "I didn't care much for this book. I didn't feel she went into detail enough about any of the characters. I felt more like the places were the main characters instead of the people. I didn't like the characters, I found them to be weird. A group of successful people with lots of money, several homes and families but they were all obsessed with an old dilapidated beach house and the crazy possessive Camilla. None of them seemed to have a connection with or cared much for their children or grand children. They all just wanted to pile up together at this beach house that they all owned together but crazy Camilla called all the shots. Very weird book. I would like to give the book negative 3 stars. The only thing going for this book was the plot twist at the end and if you paid close attention from the beginning you suspected this sort of thing to happen."}, {"userName": "Tarah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10571513-tarah", "userReview": "I have had this book for years now and kept reading the story synopsis then would put it back on the bookshelf, finally I was all out of other books so read this. Wow did I ever waste time waiting! This book was great, such a journey through life with all the characters. Never thought the ending would be so twisted but clever and it also answered questions u had throughout the story. What a wonderful book, tears and laughter, I really became invested in the characters! Loved it!"}, {"userName": "Peg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2677626-peg", "userReview": "I'm not sure the review I wrote went through, so I thought I would try again. This book seemed to go on and on with little real purpose. It is a story about a group of people, several of whom have known each other since childhood, who own a beach house together on Sullivan Island near Charleston, SC. The setting was interesting to me because we visited that area earlier this year.The group vows that they will love and care for each other forever. Through the various tragedies and stages of their relationship, this vows holds firm. I felt little investment in the characters, and even though the ending was surprising, I was glad to come to the last page. Perhaps if I had read this more quickly (like on the beach or other vacation spot), I would have enjoyed it more."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3767267-susan", "userReview": "Islands is the second title I have read by ARS (Sweetwater Creek being the first). I did not enjoy this storyline and was disappointed with the ending. Islands follows the lives of the \"Scrubs\", 4 Charleston couples who are close friends and in my opinion - way too needy of each other. They all own antiqudated old homes, as well as other assorted houses, but find they are most happy at the beach house. The story follows them through the times that they spend together at the beach house and the Lowcountry - and a few tragedies. I found these characters uninteresting and whiney. The only character I really did enjoy is Gaynelle, a strong young woman who is hired to care for one of the scrubs who is ill. I really don't know if I will read any more ARS novels. Just not my thing."}, {"userName": "Cynthia Thomason", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5470982-cynthia-thomason", "userReview": "I am a true Anne Rivers Siddons fan. I love most everything of hers I read. This book fell a little flat for me. It is written in the typical Siddons lyrical style with wonderful phrasing, elegant descriptions and her usual passion for her low country setting. My problem was with the plot which seemed to drag. I read to page 150 and stopped. I just wasn't engaged in what was going on with these characters. The initial romance was under developed. The group dynamics of the \"Scrubs\" was too narrow in focus, showing the group either grieving or whining over some incident. I kept waiting for something to happen that would make me want to turn the pages. Hate to give up on any book, especially a Siddons, but with all the wonderful books out there, well... sometimes it happens."}, {"userName": "Kw", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2206216-kw", "userReview": "I loved it. The prose is simply flawless as it soothes and sparkles and shines and just makes me feel good. I enjoyed the story, was astonished at the surprise ending, and feel as if I've OD'd on shellfish. The menus sound fattening, but the people never gain weight. And I really do hope that only imagined characters drink so much!But still, its great. If you don't want to read it, at least read about Gladys' epiphany (page 233 in my copy) and the arrival of Gaynelle on the scene (p. 284). Wonderful writing.

I was drawn into the relationships between them and the seemingly sustaining force between them. I enjoyed the dynamics between characters and the descriptions of the settings. The ending was surprising (which does not happen too often in books for me), and I enjoyed that. This book also displayes the goods and bads of deep relationships and the way the relationships develop and unfold."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4427991-mary", "userReview": "Anny Butler has always been a caretaker, a nurturer, first for her own brothers and sisters, and then as the director of an agency devoted to the welfare of children. What she has never had is a family of her own to care for. That all changes when she meets and marries Lewis Aiken, an exuberant surgeon fifteen years Anny's senior.When they marry, Anny finds her family - not a traditional one, but a group of childhood friends from Charleston who are inseparable; who are one another's surrogate family. They call themselves The Scrubs, and they all, in some way, are connected by the cord of family. Instantly upon meeting them at the old beach house on Sullivan's Island, which they co-own, Anny knows that she has ultimately found home and family. They vow that, when the time comes, they will find a place by the sea where they can live together.Bad things begin to happen - a hurricane, a fire, deaths - but still the remaining Scrubs cling together. They are watched over and bolstered by Camilla Curry, the heart and core of the group, always the healer. For the first time in her life, Anny allows Camilla to enfold her and to care for her with a kind of love and support that Anny has never experienced.I loved this book; it was one of those books that you can get lost in the storytelling of it. I'm really beginning to enjoy Anne Rivers Siddons as an author and look forward avidly to the next book of hers that I read. I have added three more books by Anne Rivers Siddons on to my Wish List and give Islands by Anne Rivers Siddons an A+!"}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1119467-diana", "userReview": "This book was ridiculously well written!

They stay at the beach house each weekend and life happens all around them. Hurricanes, fires, deaths. Fabulously story of friendship and their chosen \"family\".
