That is my face now as I finish this book. That was my face every step of the way.I heard somewhere while reading this that Gaddis is praised for this work in that he made it the ultimate challenge for the reader. Yay! Let's make reading hard! #sarcasmYou know how you might read a book with 5 storylines that will change each chapter. It might be a bit confusing, but at least chapter breaks give you the chance to regroup. This book frequently mixes many storylines, changing paragraph to paragraph with no break - it is up to you to figure out which one is going on! To add to this, there are no quotation marks for dialogue - good luck figuring out who is talking.In response to one of my updates while reading this, someone posted an article about this book (I am too exhausted from this book right now to find the article and directly quote it, but if you Google \"Why are large, painful books considered classics?\" and you will find it.) The gist of it is that people tend to rate these books highly because they are rating their accomplishment of finishing a chunky tome and not necessarily the quality of said tome. I can definitely see that being the case with The Recognitions.Another thing that I read was that the book was not well received at first, but then it started getting accolades later on because of its complexity and difficulty to read. I am not sure why that is a good thing, but it was enough for it to become a staple on many \"must read before you die\" lists.Summary - I am glad this is over. I only recommend it if you like difficult and painful reading experiences - or so you can check another book off a list."}, {"userName": "B0nnie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7355135-b0nnie", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Garima", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7915003-garima", "userReview": "Images surround us; cavorting broadcast in the minds of others, we wear the motley tailored by their bad digestions, the shame and failure, plague pandemics and private indecencies, unpaid bills, and animal ecstasies remembered in hospital beds, our worst deeds and best intentions will not stay still, scolding, mocking, or merely chattering they assail each other, shocked at recognition.\n Shocked, surprised and mesmerized by these Recognitions. Sometimes reading of a book happens without any noticeable event while other times, a single sentence affords the brilliance of a memorable experience. The perceptible sameness of things stimulates an unalterable change, a connection emerges out of nowhere and the voice of a stranger becomes familiar and captivating since it seems to carry the virtues and vices of the whole wide universe within it. This all happened for me after reading Gaddis\u2019s tour-de-force and I can vouch for the same simply because:There are words- Words which are in perfect harmony with each other and words which constantly try to find a visible shore for themselves amidst the sea of inadmissible emotions. Everything from the lucid description of a private space to the reckless telling of bared thoughts is done so masterfully here that one can\u2019t help but wonder at the images that are born out of the revelation of retrospective truth and concealment of destined lies. In between, I found poetry too.There are colors- Colors of the patient sky and impatient homes. Colors of Flemish paintings and forged wonders. Colors of innovative minds and frustrated hearts. Colors of a colorful history and colorless present. And a quest. A quest for identifying real and fake behind the several layers of these colors that emphasize the purity of a blank canvass and the misery of a disquieted soul. I became acquainted with many new shades whose existence was unknown to me. There is music-  In this Flamenco music [there is] this same arrogance of suffering, listen. The strength of it's what's so overpowering, the self-sufficiency that's so delicate and tender without an instant of sentimentality. With infinite pity but refusing pity, it's a precision of suffering. I listened.There is nature- A customary meeting that takes place between sun and moon to greet a new dawn and dusk is an essential and my most favorite part of this book. I have never read any writer who embraced nature so intimately and unifies it effortlessly with the emotional upheavals experienced by mankind. \nThe lust of summer gone, the sun made its visits shorter and more uncertain, appearing to the city with that discomfited reserve, that sense of duty of the lover who no longer loves.\n Wherever Gaddis took me, he offered the sublime company of warm rays and bright moonlight and during the instances of foggy days; I relished the unusual beauty of a silent landscape. I walked.There is noise- People meet everywhere here. At a random caf\u00e9, at causeless parties, on busy streets, in desolate apartments and in distant lands. They always have so much to say to each other and there is so much which is left unsaid. Chaos prevails, which overwhelms at times but otherwise these voices convey the most profound, entertaining and sarcastic elements that present human psychology both as fascinating and a pitiful spectacle. The trick is to find a comfortable sitting position that will give you the best view possible.\u2014We've had plenty of experiences to write home about already, said the woman with the ring at the long table where lunch had just commenced.\u2014We even got held up by a highwayman, her husband confirmed.\u2014It was on a train.\u2014You still call it a highwayman anyway, her husband said patiently, smiling his cheery smile. \u2014And he even talked English.\u2014It was broken English. And what do you think he told us? That we're just as much to blame, because we're there, that the victim abets the violence just by being there, he said, and he even made a quotation to prove it.\u2014From Dante he told us. He took all our money, at gun-point. I laughed.There is meditation- The Recognitions screamed \u2018challenging\u2019 from every angle. It is. The challenge lies not in following the thoughts of countless characters or placing the source of various cultural/religious references but rather not bothering too much about the same. This book is mainly made up of numerous moments, each bearing a significant thread to a central message. There are things which will remain incomprehensible and elusive due to different reasons for different readers, so going-with-the-flow worked pretty well for me. With a little concentration, a little acceptance and a little surrender, it was all akin to a sort of meditation. I was at peace. There is everything- Including a plot which I didn\u2019t describe and several names which I didn\u2019t take, the beauty which is inexplicable and ugliness that is inevitable, a madness which is the sanest and sanity which is fatal; this book certainly have everything to give a reader small but substantial rewards which slowly and steadily culminates into a nonpareil experience.Do recognize these Recognitions. What greater comfort does time afford, than the objects of terror re-encountered, and their fraudulence exposed in the flash of reason? Triumph! as though it were any cleaner, or happier, or more bare of disappointment, than the deadening shock of re-encounter with the object of love."}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "This book clearly influenced Pynchon and DFW and I would imagine Cormac McCarthy as well, but it is pretty damn unreadable. Looking behind The Recognitions, many level that criticism at Ulysses. Well, Ulysses does require some work, but the difference is that Stephen Daedalus as well as the Blooms are fantastic deeply moving and well-drawn characters and we WANT to see them succeed. In The Recognitions, there is a plethora of characters, but none of which I could have more than a shred of sympathy for: Otto is too pathetic, Wyatt is too broken, Recktail disappears before the end...and the characters around the have amusing characteristics (like the guy measuring the cracks in the ceiling, but I was like, so what. As for comparing it to the next of post-moderns, I think that Pynchon tells a more interesting story, that DFW draws more interesting characters and McCarthy doesn't overload his novels with 1000s of irrelevant characters.The book is written as a triptych where, for me, the first part starts clean and becomes incoherent, the second part is incoherent and the 3rd parts starts coherent and makes a tiny bit of sense at the end. This generates quite a lot of stress to me as a reader.The term \"recognition\" is used a lot in part 1 and then disappears which left me a bit rudderless.I think this book is interesting only in the historical part it played in influencing other writers, but as a standalone piece of art, it does not hold much appeal."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "100 Words in Search of PrecisionThe purpose of both Religion and Alchemy is to realise Perfection.Christianity places an obstacle in the path: Original Sin.

The novel seems destined to unravel as an absolute masterpiece after the evocative opening in Spain and small town New England, followed by a quick stay in Paris before descending (in the Dantean sense) into New York City for the majority of the book. But then it begins to meander while taking on a new agenda, one less of allusion-heavy storytelling than of society satire sans commentary: Gaddis lets large swaths of the book unfold in dialogue, with varying results in story-telling clarity and appeal. This change in focus isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it outstays its welcome so that its initial power commences to slowly dissipate, over a few hundred pages in the days just before Christmas 1949, along with any claims to sardonic subtlety. Things pick back up when the major characters head out of New York to Europe and South America, but ultimately the book either needed to say more or stay shorter to achieve the level of impact and greatness to which its author aspired. Regardless, there\u2019s a lot to love: the discussions of art, of old masters of the 15th and 16th century Flemish variety, is particularly fascinating and nuanced. Big money art forgery/theft is one of those topics\u2014like religion, sex, and pirates\u2014that\u2019s interesting just because...just because it is. And when Gaddis is on with his dark humor, he is on and is able to provoke plenty of wry smiles by cleverly deriding the religious, the faux-intellectual, and the materialistic. His writing style is cold but extravagant: flowery, but in a German sort of way. Many sentences, especially those at the beginning and the end of chapters, are quirky and knotted, requiring a few minutes to unwind and comprehend-something that I generally, masochistically enjoy. Furthermore, I\u2019m very sympathetic to Gaddis\u2019 overarching point about falsity, about the counterfeit nature of the world from which it\u2019s nearly impossible to escape into a life of integrity-fueled deliberateness, particularly given the excessive materialism/ advertising/ bullshitting that goes on. Very sympathetic to this. In fact, I love the theme. But it becomes repetitive and occasionally over-obvious: some of the absurd dialogue, which can be very funny, often devolves into a game of point-and-laugh at the idiot that eventually makes you and the author feel like the only genuine, intelligent, and well-meaning people in the world. I.e. you get your ego stroked, but well past the moment of climax until it becomes uncomfortable and even painful. You are conditioned to see fakers, forgers, and counterfeiters everywhere\u2014and you will\u2014but you begin to realize that the book doesn\u2019t have much else to say. And though it does take us on an interesting journey to another time and other places, very little is suggested for avoiding the ever-present trappings of a bullshit life.Most of the large cast of characters exist to be mocked by Gaddis via their own unsubtle dialogue, and while this provides a significant portion of the book's humor (which, unfortunately, can disappear for hundreds of pages at time), it gets tiresome. Gaddis was clearly influenced by Proust's aims to document and expose certain social classes of his time, and he attempts something similar to Proust\u2019s handling of the Faubourg Saint-Germain with New York's post-war Village art scenesters. Multiple long parties pervade the book\u2019s middle section, including one (short by Proust standards) that nears 100 pages, and they consist mostly of dialogue designed to bring scorn upon the pseudo-intellectual and the bourgeois. The ethical incuriousness, the intellectual vacancy, and the self-serving idiocy are soon fully apparent. And then remain apparent. Still. Over and over. Again. And while this kind of thing can work in the right hands (Proust\u2019s), Gaddis' writing talents, while impressive, aren't able to arouse and maintain the same level of interest in the characters and their petty lives. We\u2019re left with a scathing and prescient indictment of a social class and movement, but one that doesn't translate into the most compelling fiction. Thankfully some of the novel\u2019s most memorable and inspiring characters come out of this quirky social group, including my personal favorites: Stanley, the painfully na\u00efve and devout Catholic who\u2019s working on an ambitious organ piece; and Anselm, the conflicted, crawling and acne-riddled wild card. The criticisms mentioned so far have been relatively minor; the real problems exist with the protagonists. Recently I've run into the dilemma of reviewing books that impressed me while leaving little room to fall in love. Or, more accurately, too much room\u2014a remoteness from the major characters and a lack of palpable humanity or believable human insight. After spending hundreds of pages with Hal Incandenza from Infinite Jest or Tyrone Slothrop from Gravity\u2019s Rainbow, I can\u2019t say that I got to know them or believe in them as real people with truly human concerns and motivations. I didn\u2019t love, hate, like, dislike, or care much about them. I can now add Wyatt Gwyon and even the more recognizably human Otto from The Recognitions to this dubious list of protagonists from sprawling 20th century white man epics. Wyatt, like Slothrop after him, is an unpredictable semi-human, someone to marvel at rather than learn from, always maintaining a safe distance from the reader with his extraordinary talent and bizarrely antisocial behavior. The failure to connect meaningfully with the protagonists in these novels is paradoxical given the time spent with them, page by page. A 200-page book with big type, wide margins, and healthy spacing can make me cry, but The Recognitions\u2019s most prominent player feels as remote and inhuman as Keanu Reeves in (______). That doesn\u2019t seem quite right. I\u2019m not looking for visceral thrills here, but I\u2019m also not reading fiction just to learn things about things. I\u2019m trying to gain exposure to those with a gift for prying open humanity to look into some small part of its multifaceted and contradictory glory, those who can maybe lead me toward piecing things together-about me, others-that I\u2019m too stupid, lazy, or unaware to figure out on my own. Unfortunately The Recognitions joins my growing shelf of impressive and impressively un-emotive books. Which isn't to say that this book or the two mentioned above don't have many rewarding or exciting aspects. It rarely felt like a chore to read, and I probably hold longer books to a higher standard, if for no other reason than that they require a greater investment. The fact that this book is good in so many ways serves to increase my disappointment with the characterization. Wyatt, the protagonist, spends most of the book balancing on the edge of sanity while spewing hyper-erudite musings on ancient religions and painting details in a mostly disconnected, stuttering fashion. His stream of consciousness often feels so divorced from sanity that it\u2019s complete gibberish to anyone without a serious background in ancient religions, alchemy, and other esoterica (i.e. pretty much everyone). Without the knowledge to contextualize Wyatt\u2019s or his father's mutterings, these often read like foreign languages-which, I should point out, are used quite liberally throughout the text. Gaddis certainly doesn't wear his knowledge or sources lightly, and a cynical person could say this untethered recondite regurgitation may have been employed to mask laziness or limited understanding on the part of the author. Additionally, and I don\u2019t say this lightly, Gaddis\u2019 use of language often leans toward the pretentious. George Eliot (if I remember correctly, one of Gaddis\u2019 literary heroes) could have been speaking about Gaddis himself when she writes teasingly in Middlemarch: \"Things never began with Mr. Borthrop Trumbull: they always commenced.\" Without fail, Gaddis substitutes \u201ccommence\u201d for \u201cstart\u201d or \u201cbegin\u201d, and it creates a somewhat strange, if memorable, reading experience. One reason why some of the characters failed to work for me is that they seem to exist primarily to carry out the literary, medieval, magical, and religious allusions in strikingly literal terms (e.g. sex with a bull, self-castration, Mithraism church service, crucifixion, animal sacrifice to please/plead with God), which can feel overdone and distinctly inhuman. Sure, you could argue that these are the areas where the book bridges realism and modernism with postmodernism, part of what makes this novel so unique. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d characterize this book\u2014mostly pre-modern in feel\u2014as such a bridge, and regardless, this approach doesn\u2019t work. While Gaddis derides a novelist overheard in Rome toward the end of the book who claims that his \u201cnovel is written, I just have to add the motivation,\u201d I think that his own approach-the exact opposite-is equally problematic. He started out attempting to rewrite Faust within the modern age, and much of that story still exists in the text, but in addition, his characters frequently behave in ways that only make sense in the context of the sources that Gaddis weaves into the story. This is backwards. When Wyatt steals the gold bull from Valentine, this should have been in service of the plot of The Recognitions. It isn\u2019t really, and confusion only subsides with a little allusive sleuthing: the gold bull is a \u201csymbol of creative force, breaking the egg to give birth to the earth\u201d, and you realize later that this theft coincides with the end of Wyatt\u2019s amazing forgery work. So his creative force is taken out of the service of Brown and Valentine, perhaps to be recommenced elsewhere. Clever, but the action itself is simply bizarre and explained away as a sequela of Wyatt\u2019s temporary insanity. This is the manner in which the plot often unfolds, with characters in service of the novel\u2019s sources rather than the other way around. Gaddis began with \u201cthe motivation\u201d and forgot that living, breathing characters were just as, if not more, important. It just occurred to me that there's probably a reason why this book is little known and little read, even by cult epic standards. Gravity\u2019s Rainbow and Ulysses are more difficult and Infinite Jest is certainly longer, but each of these books enjoys more popularity than The Recognitions. So while I think it\u2019s a good book, its place (or lack thereof) in 20th century literature 55 years later is probably justified and unlikely to change significantly in the future. I wouldn\u2019t try to talk anyone out of reading this, but I\u2019d suggest you try many of the other books you\u2019re \u201csupposed to\u201d read from this century first. As the The Recognitions itself suggests: if you think that you may have stumbled upon a rarefied, out-of-the-way masterpiece, a scenario that appears just too good to be true\u2026well\u2026yes."}, {"userName": "Erik F.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7324260-erik-f", "userReview": "Overlong? Probably. Grandiose? Almost certainly. Brilliant? Most definitely. This swollen, acerbic cult classic bursts with such wild imagination, vivid characterization and profound eloquence that I couldn't help but love it. Its many characters swirl in and out of each other's lives throughout the nearly thousand-page text, their paths and conversations overlapping like a most rambunctious Altman ensemble film (though with Gaddis's relentless and sometimes hallucinatory skewering of organized religion and the bourgeoisie, it might seem closer to a Bu\u00f1uel satire).The novel is a literary triptych, divided into three distinct segments that focus on various forms of art and forgery, and the perpetually blurred line between reality and illusion (not to mention the poisonous relationship between art and capitalism). The art world is not the only subject to be impaled upon Gaddis's eviscerating pen: the realms of business, politics, and religion also get their fair share of (often well-deserved) scorn and cynicism. The book's second and largest segment, set mostly in a feverish, forbidding vision of New York City, hinges together the smaller outer segments which mirror each other in many ways. Within this framework the reader enters a social whirlwind containing sinister art dealers, eccentric writers, struggling musicians, corrupt clergymen, con artists, counterfeiters, advertising agents, hitmen, WASPs, bohemians, transvestites, desperate housewives, and so forth, as they talk, travel, eavesdrop, cheat, steal, murder and deceive their ways through their pointless days. Gaddis captures a culture of people too self-absorbed to perceive any sort of higher truth, and too emotionally atrophied to form meaningful connections with others. While the obsessive artists yearn to transcend modern humanity with their works, everyone else sinks deeper into a fog of fraud and miscommunication. The transatlantic voyage that many of the characters take in Part III dispels this fog for some, but thickens it for others, as the novel builds toward its tragic yet strangely triumphant conclusion.The Recognitions is remarkably dense and erudite; Gaddis has a striking way of intertwining historical, artistic, literary, theological and mythological arcana and symbolism with his descriptions, crafting multilayered allusions that resonate throughout the text and across centuries of human thought and creation. When he succeeds at this, it is stunning. When it seems a little strained, well, it's still educational. Readers flustered by his range of esoteric knowledge can still find much to admire elsewhere; his sardonic sense of humor will appeal to a certain audience, and his often breathtaking writing skills will appeal to anyone who loves language. So, whether or not this fiery novel is truly the missing link between literary modernism and postmodernism, it simply must be experienced on its own terms \u2014 even when it threatens to collapse under the weight of its own obese ambitions."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "I found a great article onLITERARY STOCKHOLM SYNDROMEby Mark O'Connell which uses The Recognitions as its main example - here is the bit I liked, but the whole article is worth a read (http://www.themillions.com/2011/05/th...)the greatness of a novel in the mind of its readers is often alloyed with those readers\u2019 sense of their own greatness (as readers) for having conquered it. I don\u2019t think William Gaddis\u2019s The Recognitions, for instance, is nearly as fantastic a novel as people often claim it is. But it is one of the most memorable and monumental experiences of my reading life. And these are the reasons why: because the thing was just so long; because I had such a hard time with it; and because I eventually finished it. (I read it as part of an academic reading group devoted to long and difficult American novels, and I\u2019m not sure I would have got to the end of it otherwise). Reading a novel of punishing difficulty and length is a version of climbing Everest for people who prefer not to leave the house. And people who climb Everest don\u2019t howl with exhilaration at the summit because the mountain was a good or a well made or an interesting mountain per se, but because they\u2019re overawed at themselves for having done such a fantastically difficult thing. (I\u2019m willing to concede that they may not howl with exhilaration at all, what with the tiredness, the lack of oxygen and very possibly the frostbite. I\u2019ll admit to being on shaky ground here, as I\u2019ve never met anyone who\u2019s climbed Everest, nor am I likely to if I continue not going out of the house.)And there is, connected with this phenomenon, what I think of as Long Novel Stockholm syndrome. My own first experience of it\u2014or at least my first conscious experience of it\u2014was, again, with The Recognitions. With any novel of that difficulty and length (976 pages in my prestigiously scuffed and battered Penguin edition), the reader\u2019s aggregate experience is bound to be composed of a mixture of frustrations and pleasures. But what I found with Gaddis\u2019s gigantic exploration of fraudulence and creativity was that, though they were greatly outnumbered by the frustrations, the pleasures seemed to register much more firmly. If I were fully honest with myself, I would have had to admit that I was finding the novel gruelingly, unsparingly tedious. But I wasn\u2019t prepared to be fully honest with myself. Because every couple of hundred pages or so, Gaddis would take pity on me and throw me a bone in the form of an engaging, genuinely compelling set piece. Like the wonderful episode in which one of the characters, under the impression that he is being given a gift of $5,000 by his long-lost father whom he has arranged to meet at a hotel, is in fact mistakenly being given a suitcase full of counterfeit cash by a failed confidence man. And then Gaddis would roll up his sleeves again and get back to the real business of boring me insensible with endless pages of direct-dialogue bluster about art, theology and the shallowness of post-war American culture.I kept at it, doughtily ploughing my way through this seemingly inexhaustible stuff, holding out for another interlude of clemency from an author I knew was capable of entertaining and provoking me. At some point towards the end of the book it occurred to me that what I was experiencing could be looked at as a kind of literary variant of the Stockholm syndrome phenomenon, whereby hostages experience a perverse devotion to their captors, interpreting any abstention from violence and cruelty, however brief or arbitrary, as acts of kindness and even love. Psychologically, this is understood as a defense mechanism in which the victim fabricates a \u201cgood\u201d side of the aggressor in order to avoid confronting the overwhelming terror of his or her situation. Perhaps I\u2019m stretching the bonds of credulity by implicitly comparing William Gaddis to a FARC guerilla commander, but I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s something that happens when we get into a captive situation with a long and difficult book that is roughly analogous to the Stockholm syndrome scenario. For a start, the book\u2019s very length lays out (for a certain kind of reader, at least) its own special form of imperative\u2014part challenge, part command. The thousand-pager is something you measure yourself against, something you psyche yourself up for and tell yourself you\u2019re going to endure and/or conquer. And this does, I think, amount to a kind of captivity: once you\u2019ve got to Everest base camp, you really don\u2019t want to pack up your stuff and turn back. I think it\u2019s this principle that explains, for example, the fact that I\u2019ve read Gravity\u2019s Rainbow but gave up halfway through The Crying of Lot 49, when the latter could be used as a handy little bookmark for the former. When you combine this (admittedly self-imposed) captivity with a novel\u2019s formidable reputation for greatness, you\u2019ve got a perfect set of conditions for the literary Stockholm syndrome to kick in.In order for a very long novel to get away with long, cruel sessions of boredom-torture, it has to commit, every so often, an act of kindness such as the counterfeit cash set piece in The Recognitions. This is why Ulysses is so deeply loved by so many readers\u2014as well it should be\u2014while Finnegans Wake has been read almost exclusively by Joyce scholars (of whom I\u2019m tempted to think as the Patty Hearsts of literature). After the grueling ordeal of the \u201cScylla and Charybdis\u201d episode, in which Stephen stands around in the National Library for dozens of pages boring everyone to damn-near-literal tears with his theories about the provenance of Hamlet, we are given the unrestrained pleasure of the \u201cWandering Rocks\u201d episode. Ulysses might treat us like crap for seemingly interminable stretches of time, but it extends just enough in the way of writerly benevolence to keep us onside. And this kindness is the key to Stockholm syndrome. You don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to come, or what form it\u2019s going to take, but you get enough of it to keep you from despising your captor, or mounting a brave escape attempt by flinging the wretched thing across the room."}, {"userName": "Geoff", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126266-geoff", "userReview": "Gaddis\u2019s first novel is a big, ambitious thing, a juggernaut, overwhelming, a planetary body\u2019s worth of kinetic energy packed into its 956 pages. \u201cPlanetary\u201d is a descriptor I come back to again and again while thinking about this book- it not only reflects the geographic scope of the novel, which unfolds across oceans and continents (though for the greater part we do not leave the microcosmic nocturama of New York City), but also the attempt to put a world\u2019s sum of knowledge and history into one work, to recreate the world of accumulated human experience within this massive triptych\u2019s unity. \u201cUnity\u201d is another word appropriate for The Recognitions, for as multifaceted and hydra-headed and sprawling as the novel appears, the book is affixed to a structure as deliberate as a map of the stars for any particular season- warp The Recognitions back in on itself, make of it a mobius strip, and I believe one would find the beginning and ending of the novel conversing with each other, events unfolding in parallel, phrases and images resurfacing at precise moments, which of course adds depth and resonance to that all too perfect title. As you sail your way across the churning ocean of this book, you will have your moments of recognition, not only within the reflexive texture of the text, whose component parts speak to and among each other, but your own personal world, the world outside, will begin to engage a conversation with the novel. For there is something mysteriously breathing about this book, and descending into it or rising out of it is akin to what it must be like to penetrate the atmosphere of a planet and fall into the rich air of earth, for those who have spent a stint on a space station. Or, more apropos of the novel, like the emergence from the abyss of the sea into the fecund air and bright blue cloud-ripped sunlight sailors on submarines must experience when returning home- a world retrieved- brought from the depths into the air as if fished for. Going into or out of the novel, from its world into your own or vice versa. Ascent and descent. Emergence and recognition.Of course, everything is achieved through language. Gaddis\u2019s use of language in The Recognitions, the style of The Recognitions, its mythologizing and allusion-laden style, is where the \u201cAmerican heir to Joyce\u201d comparison is validated. Gaddis appears especially like the Joyce of Ulysses in this context, but we must delimit and narrow this comparison, because the similarity in the appropriation and layering of mythical, historical, and religious language and imagery into the text, and a certain kind of \u201cwriting around scenes\u201d, where important narrative points are told obliquely, is where the similarity ends. Gaddis is not playing the parodist of styles that Joyce is in Ulysses, Gaddis is not interested in interior dialogue, stream of consciousness, in fact he remains distinctly exterior to his characters, eliding dialogue with ellipses and fragmented sentences, leaving much to be completed by the reader, assumed, read into- there is no interior representation of Gaddis\u2019s characters, only their actions are shown and their broken voices remade into mosaic. If one had to compare the Gaddis of The Recognitions with Joyce, it would be, I think, more the Joyce of A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man. There is the same obsessive infiltration and exploration of Catholic ritual, that ritual extended into the secular world, there is the same brooding over the spirit and the Ideal as represented in religious texts and contrasted with their representation and use in secular artworks, there is the exploration of the suffering caused by seeking perfection and coming into contact with beauty, the suffering of the artist and the conflict of attempting the spiritual within the material world. The allusion-heavy, mythologized language in The Recognitions serves to eliminate centuries, to collapse the intellectual history of humanity, so that into these moments in the months surrounding Christmas 1949 in New York City and the world at large, the eternal can flow through the gestures of these characters. It gives a seemingly limitless depth to the reading experience, as allusion and reference bloom into recognition, as image and word create resonance that echoes beyond the walls of the specific place of 1949 America. Gaddis, like Joyce, universalizes the mundane, very effectively, through precise reference. And while The Recognitions is most certainly a (postmodern?) comedy, a scathing satire and a polemical cultural critique of the shallow products of \u201cThe Age of Publicity\u201d, it shares a great deal thematically, and in its tone, its prose-hues, with the Russian-Christian morality epics of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. The spiritual struggle at the heart of the book, the manner of characterization, the moral dilemmas it presents, even the descriptions of New York City as a frozen winterscape, recall vividly moments out of Crime and Punishment or The Brothers Karamazov, even to some extent the social satire of Anna Karenina. The same kind of weary, exhausted late-Christian conflict, searching representations of eternity for something to validate the finite, flawed nature of human life, and coming away empty-handed and with no answer wetting the lips, pervades.And so The Recognitions is about art and art forgery, about authenticity and (the impossibility of) originality, about the crisis of the individual in a universe at best indifferent and at worst openly hostile to dignified living. It is a brilliant, necessary cultural critique that emerged from mid-20th century America, dripping with that thick black blood (sangre negro de mi coraz\u00f3n) that courses coldly through the mechanized American heart, that seems now to ring more true than ever (especially in the party scenes composed of the overlapping babbling of voices ultimately testifying to nothing but the vanity of the speakers, a prophecy of the social media age if ever there was one), a satire of the narcissism and shallow preening of contemporary mores, which have since only progressed further into fragmentation and alienation, an excoriation of the money-driven society, of blind faith in technology, market forces, media, the myth of \u201cprogress\u201d and the vulgarization and commodification of personality, religion, art, conversation, relationships, information. It is howlingly funny and at the same time bleakly pessimistic. It reaches to find meaning in the higher pursuits of man, but collides only with layer upon layer of fraud. It finds the reek of money at the heart of everything. It is an epic of a fallen, sunken world, a world submerged, where everyone is already drowned and trying to claw their way out of personal purgatories and into the light of a sham sun in the sky that might as well be the fires of hell in the underworld. It is two mirrors turned to each other and the retreat of the face reflected into the winnowing abyss, but all the reflections have something to sell, and are thus validated as real, here in this chimeric world. It pursues the pursuit of redemption and atonement. As much as it is about Art and Artifice it is about Death, as much as a painting (or a book) is dead as soon as it is completed, and feigns eternity, and feigns timelessness, as do all of our higher aspirations.The dedication that opens the book, to Gaddis\u2019s daughter Sarah, is from TS Eliot\u2019s poem \u201cMarina\u201d. It is a thing of great beauty itself, and any reader of The Recognitions will find in it echoes of that text, those texts communicating, so why not, in the spirit of appropriation, reproduce it here in full, if for no other reason than to beautify my own work with someone else\u2019s labor.MarinaQuis hic locus, quae regio, quae mundi plaga?What seas what shore what grey rocks and what islandsWhat water lapping the bowAnd scent of pine and the woodthrush singing through the fogWhat images returnO my daughter.Those who sharpen the tooth of the dog, meaningDeathThose who glitter with the glory of the hummingbird, meaningDeathThose who sit in the sty of contentment, meaningDeathThose who suffer the ecstasy of the animals, meaningDeathAre become unsubstantial, reduced by a wind,A breath of pine, and the woodsong fogBy this grace dissolved in placeWhat is this face, less clear and clearerThe pulse in the arm, less strong and stronger\u2013Given or lent? more distant than stars and nearer than the eyeWhispers and small laughter between leaves and hurrying feetUnder sleep, where all the waters meet.Bowsprit cracked with ice and paint cracked with heat.I made this, I have forgottenAnd remember.The rigging weak and the canvas rottenBetween one June and another September.Made this unknowing, half conscious, unknown, my own.The garboard strake leaks, the seams need caulking.This form, this face, this lifeLiving to live in a world of time beyond me; let meResign my life for this life, my speech for that unspoken,The awakened, lips parted, the hope, the new ships.What seas what shores what granite islands towards my timbersAnd woodthrush calling through the fogMy daughter."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward", "userReview": "What I get a kick out of is serious writers who write a book where they say money gives a false significance to art, and then they raise hell when their book doesn\u2019t make any money.- William Gaddis, The RecognitionsI\u2019ve never seen novel by William Gaddis available in any library or bookstore, and the fact that he is not more widely known is something of a crime. You could compare his prose against that of any of the great writers of the last century without exception, and it would more than hold its own. And a titanic novel like The Recognitions demonstrates his talent not only through its wonderful prose, but also in its astounding diversity and scope of ambition. Take this description of Madrid\u2019s Retiro Park, seen through the eyes of Reverend Gwyon, early in the novel:\nIn that undawned light the solid granite benches were commensurably sized and wrought to appear as the unburied caskets of children. Behind them the trees stood leafless, waiting for life, but as yet coldly exposed in their differences, waiting formally arranged, like the moment of silence when one enters a party of people abruptly turned, holding their glasses at attention, a party of people all the wrong size. There, balanced upon pedestals, thrusting their own weight against the weight of time never yielded to nor beaten off but absorbed in the chipped vacancies, the weathering, the negligent unbending of white stone, waited figures of the unlaid past.\nWhat a tremendously vivid description, awash with desolation and meloncholy, which yet evokes a sense of the eternal and the mythic. There\u2019s something about the syntax, the word choice and the mood created by these kinds of passages are reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s style. But that\u2019s not to say that Gaddis writes like McCarthy (or more accurately, vice versa). What is striking is his ability to adopt changing styles; these vurtuosic shifts from poetry to realism, to dream-like surrealism; in one moment colloquial, in the next erudite, in a way that is masterful, surprising, and constantly challenges the reader. How about this account of Stanley\u2019s frantic sexual desire, suppressed by religious proscriptions, and made manifest:\nDirectly he was alone, he was assailed by her simulacra, in all states of acute sorrow, or smiling, of complete abstraction or painful animation, of dress and undress, as he had seen her these last few days: directly he was alone, the images came to mock everything he had seen. Her sadness became shrieking grief, and her animation riotous, immodest in dress and licentious in nakedness, many-limbed as some wild avatar of the Hindu cosmology assaulting the days he spent copying his work on clean scores, and the nights he passed alone in his chair where, instantly the lights went out, everything was transformed, and the body he had seen a moment before with no more surprise than its simple lines and modest unself-conscious movement permitted, rose up on him full-breasted and vaunting the belly, limbs indistinguishable until he was brought down between them and stifled in moist collapse.\nGaddis has blurred the line between reality and fantasy, and we are never really certain of precisely what is taking place. There is more going on here than is initially apparent to the reader, and this is a constant feature of Gaddis\u2019s writing. If you happen to dislike Faulkner for his obfuscatory style, you will find Gaddis infuriating. Each new chapter is an exercise in reasoning and deduction: it is not unusual for main characters in a scene not to be named and for dialogue to be unattributed, with the expectation that the reader should be able to infer the necessary detail from clues in the context, and from the distinct personality and voice that Gaddis has imbued each character. This presupposes that the reader has been paying very close attention, and is able to fill in the gaps without exposition. Much of what occurs in this book, then, occurs between the lines. Take this wonderful description of Mr. Pivner, in a rush:\nOver and under the ground he hurried toward the place where he lived. No fragment of time nor space anywhere was wasted, every instant and every cubic centimeter crowded crushing outward upon the next with the concentrated activity of a continent spending itself upon a rock island, made a world to itself where no present existed. Each minute and each cubic inch was hurled against that which would follow, measured in terms of it, dictating a future as inevitable as the past, coined upon eight million counterfeits who moved with the plumbing weight of lead coated with the frenzied hope of quicksilver, protecting at every pass the cherished falsity of their milled edges against the threat of hardness in their neighbors as they were rung together, fallen from the Hand they feared but could no longer name, upon the pitiless table stretching all about them, tumbling there in all the desperate variety of which counterfeit is capable, from the perfect alloy recast under weight to the thudding heaviness of lead, and the thinly coated brittle terror of glass.\nThis is a complex metaphor worthy of Pynchon. It\u2019s mostly incomprehensible on initial reading, and the first clue comes several pages later when it is noted that the population of Manhattan is eight million people, and we have confirmation for the first time of the setting for this scene, and upon rereading the above passage can begin to unpack what it might be implying about these eight million inhabitants who spend themselves as counterfeit currency there. The metaphor roots itself in the core themes of the novel: counterfeit, forgery, plagiarism, imitation. The Recognitions explores imitation and originality as moral ambiguities within the overall context of art and life. It explores artistic ambition, genius and mediocrity, and the surprising consequences of each. There is Wyatt\u2019s genius for imitation, which is accepted as original; Otto\u2019s mediocre originality, which is seen as plagiarism (of Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, of all things), and there is Stanley\u2019s drive to create an original musical piece that encompasses everything: we see the disastrous effects of his ambition, and the paltry products of his success. All lives are revealed to be driven by counterfeit representations, counterfeit desires, counterfeit personalities, deteriorating to the final inevitable condition: the trading of counterfeit identities, and finally, counterfeit human bodies.The Recognitions is dripping with postmodern self-awareness. There are recurring leitmotifs (a tale of an anchor dropped from the celestial sea, the song Return to Sorrento), as well as references to real-world books (The Sound and the Fury, Nightwood), and people (A Big Unshaven Man who may or may not be Ernest Hemingway): Gaddis infuses his novel with an awareness that he himself as an artist and his novel as an artistic work are subject to the same rules and criticisms as those of his characters. There is an acknowledgment that true originality is an impossibility, and that art by necessity must draw from its predecessors in order to be recognisable and accepted. Gaddis realised that comparisons to other writers (Joyce and Faulkner, for example) would be inevitable, and by including these references in the book and writing with such clear self-awareness he both anticipates these criticisms and expands the The Recognitions into a kind of metafiction: an exploration of art and the artist in a way that manages to transcend the natural boundaries of the novel form."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg", "userReview": "I've been meaning to read one of Gaddis' big novels for years now, ten or so actually. I'd always been drawn more to trying my hand with JR, but after reading Franzen's essay a few years ago on Gaddis I sort of changed my mind, and decided that if the day ever came when I'd read Gaddis I'd start at the beginning of his work. Then of course at some point I realized that being the type of person I am I had to read this book because it fills out the lower rung of the trinity of difficult post-1950 American novels. A lot of good things can be said of this book, and for the first about six hundred pages it's really fucking good and then Gaddis decided to get a little weird. Is this a spoiler coming up? I don't know. Around the page of the beast he starts killing off characters, and about the same time he decides that it's best to kill them off sometimes with it being very difficult for the reader to follow who is dying, and even in the non-death parts, and who exactly is taking part in scenes. At the book's worst it turns into the awful dialog parts of the Left Behind novels, where the only way to tell which character is speaking is to count back the paragraphs, in the Lahaye books though the characters and the form of the writing don't have silences to mess up the count. So at a certain point I got a little lost, I started to feel like I felt when reading the first chapter of Ulysses when I had no idea what was going on, or even a point of reference to place the text in, unlike in Joyce though, when everything feels like it is all coming together in this book it begins to move towards entropy from about 2/3's of the book till the end.Reading the book at the time it came out must have been something though. A few years later the Beats would supposedly smash up American Literature with their little revolution, but seeing what Gaddis did in this book was much more defining of American serious literature than the half-assed autobiographical masturbatory 'look how cool me and my friends are' books that would categorize the high points of Beat literature. There is something in this book that is aspiring to the high Modernism of the works of Joyce and Proust, but then there is something leaning towards the meta-fiction to come on the scene in the next decade. It is this position the book straddles that makes for a particular unease and I think, in historical retrospect, a kind of failing. Gaddis is on the path to something new, but he doesn't quite pull it off. This doesn't make any sense probably. I guess what I'm meaning to say is that he is paving the way for some of my favorite books to be written, and he's obviously an influence of some kind on Pynchon and DFW and their ilk, but in his own masterpiece he falls short of achieving what they would be able to, but at the same time he is out of touch just enough with what came before him that this novel sits uncomfortably between two difficult styles.

Then it rained again, and the whole creation was transformed into cold slop, which made walking adventuresome. Then it froze; and every corner presented opportunity for entertainment, the vastly amusing spectacle of well-dressed people suspended in the indecorous positions which precede skull fractures.\u201d  Humour/beauty/sadness/rage. Look at that technique: the alliteration, the bounce of buried n's, the repetition of \"evenly\", the choice of \"smoke-fall\" and \"adventuresome\" and \"indecorous\" and \"cold slop\". This is how one makes a clich\u00e9 come alive \u2013 for how can the snow/slop/yellow-dog-piss/slipping be anything but a clich\u00e9? \u2013and make it funny (it is the use of \"indecorous\" which does it, I think). Gaddis, with his ruinous Cassandra complex, places pins precisely and most exquisitely painfully in the torso of our society, as it was then, is now, and shall be forevermore. We are facile, self-absorbed, cruel creatures, wilfully gullible, deafened by the monotony of our own voices. We are to be pitied and to be laughed at. And yet, any attempt to judge from the side-lines must always already be a failure, and only by straining towards the authentic can we even approach that which lies outside our-Selves, though we must be prepared to drown in the process.  This story was about some people coming out of church, and they saw an anchor dangling by a rope from the sky. The anchor caught in the tombstones, and then they watched and saw a man coming down the rope, to unhook it. But when he reached the earth they went over to him and he was dead\u2026He looked up at both of them from the glass. \u2013 Dead as though he'd been drowned.  Gaddis says in an interview somewhere that he re-read this novel after its publication and was embarrassed by its youthful arrogance, its narcissism, its desire to demonstrate great learning. He is correct, I think. But I love it for that. I love that he just goes all out, strips himself naked and streaks across the pitch. And when what is being put on display is so damn beautiful, and so damn interesting, who can care that the rules of decorum are breached, that the police (with Mr Franzen in their midst, his hipster-dark glasses slightly askew) are hot on his heels with blankets to cover and smother and bury him deep. I shall stick out my legs to trip them. I shall eternally cheer him on from the side-lines. But how, as an atheist, can I feel so strongly these struggles with Christ? It is because there is something wonderfully, and devastatingly, human in these lacerations of the heart. How must it be to live in a universe rich with God? How must it be to truly feel all this, as Marlow did:  \"See, see, where Christ's blood streams in the firmament. / One drop would save my soul, half a drop. Ah, my Christ!\". The pain is real, and the suffering runs deep, the fact that I may see only man fighting Fight-Club-style with himself is entirely beside the point. One more thing. I kept regular \"updates\" here to disprove the theory that 'big' and 'difficult' (big compared to what? difficult compared to what?) books are loved solely in hindsight, that the euphoria felt at Everest's summit blinds us to the struggle of the climb. This is simply not true. There was not a single damn page of this book that was not pleasurable, interesting, engaging and heartfelt. I knew from less than 20 pages in that I was in the presence of a Master, and one whom I could trust with the long journey ahead. Not once did this trust seem misplaced, and not once did I notice the blisters. Of course it is not perfect, nothing is, and of course one could point to paragraphs where the cogs can be seen, but this does not matter in the least, and does nothing to diminish the Work. I have my personal Pantheon, those few books I place above all the others: The Death of Virgil; The Waves; Doctor Faustus; Poems of Paul Celan. This novel joins them. I intend, before the year is through, to read all of his novels and the letters. Thy Will be done, on My shelf as it is on Yours. Or, to put it another way, this novel is chavenet, totally chavenet.  Let mind be more precious than soul; it will not Endure. Soul grasps its price, begs its own peace, Settles with tears and sweat, is possibly Indestructible. That I can believe. Though I would scorn the mere instinct of faith, Expediency of assent, if I dared, What I dare not is a waste history Or void rule. Averroes, old heathen, If only you had been right, if Intellect Itself were absolute law, sufficient grace, Our lives could be a myth of captivity Which we might enter: an unpeopled region Of ever new-fallen snow, a palace blazing With perpetual silence as with torches.

Zimmerman changed to Dylan...What is Authenticity then?The dictionary definition: true to one\u2019s personality, spirit, or character.The Recognitions is many things, but ultimately, it's an artist\u2019s quest of for an authentic self, told stylistically through satire and the exploration of forgery on all levels.Wyatt Gwyon is an artist, who after meeting a rather dubious character with a fabulously dubious name, Rektall Brown, makes a Faustian deal to forge the paintings of the Flemish artists. And so begins Wyatt\u2019s psychological odyssey to define his sense of self as he wrangles with a sentiment inherited in his youth and religious upbringing, \u2018to sin is to falsify something in the Divine Order\u2019.Although Wyatt\u2019s quest for an authentic self is at the core, he is \u2014like the Infinite Jest cartridge of its namesake novel\u2014 largely absent throughout the story; a phantom protagonist or as in a painting, a negative space to accent other areas. The remains of the story are narrated in several varying styles from several different points of view and characters.Many of these characters undergo significant changes, including their names \u2013like Mr. Robert Zimmerman\u2014 that can go unrecognised and it\u2019s not until later on in the text that one recognises their voice, their tone and character. Their reappearance, in their different guises, pulls one's attention into focus, as you being to realise \u2014like scrutinising a painting up close\u2014 you could be missing the wider effect and to pay greater attention to the these amorphous characters.Echoes, motifs and repetition of statements, phrases and even dialog reinforce these multiple viewpoints and encourage one to scrutinise who is the originator of the thought and the theme and reiterates the question of authenticity. And several times I questioned my sanity... Did I read that already? Was this something I read elsewhere, both in the book or otherwise?The book is structured in three parts and with many layers of interest such as multiple languages and cultural history; and like Gravity\u2019s Rainbow, in it\u2019s complexity of form, draws upon numerous esoteric forms of reference such as art history and religion, mythology, meta physics, astronomy, mummification and even witchcraft. While the entire book is incredible the two opening chapters are especially captivating and I knew early on I was reading a writing style which is the DNA of so much of the writing I admire. It\u2019s the prototype of Delillo, Gass, Pynchon and Salinger. Especially Delillo.While Delillo has a more visual style, it\u2019s Gaddis\u2019s style of character dialog which unites them in tone and texture. In numerous party scenes speech is grammatically incorrect, colloquial and frequently truncated. Characters constantly interrupt each other, directly and in passing, as well as disruptions from external ambient invasions such as radio chatter, telephone calls, televisions, and nearby music. It\u2019s a stimulating and heady cacophony of vernacular voice and measure and creates drama and momentum. And like Delillo, Gaddis draws out tremendously genuine and real subtleties, nuances and character traits which in turn depict the societal pressures that drive people to change their names, project their alter egos and wear their masks. Masks and alternates selves are a recurring theme throughout.In a mythic novel nothing is inconsequential. And it becomes apparent through the repetitions, recursions and recognitions that Gaddis cross references myth, religion and world literature, but never does he compromises the sophistication of storytelling or the craft of his prose style - of which is compact and taut in description and poetic in form. The Recognitions is funny, tragic and moving. It\u2019s a fierce satire on authenticity in art and the act of creation; on fraudulence and fakery at all levels\u2026Since 1958 to 2013 Art and the art world has undergone significant change. Painting is no longer deemed as important, or as key an artistic medium as it once was; media, technology and the internet-of-things, apps, connectivity and social media are all impacting how we define and project ourselves. The masks we wear, consciously or subconsciously, are even more complex and multifarious. William Gaddis was only 30 when this, his debut novel, was first published in 1958.

I'd be wondering, hmmm, what should I read now, and there it'd be, the biggest book on the shelf. And I'd say....nah. Until finally I decided to stop being a bitch and actually read it.And you know what? It's pretty good. Definitely a work of genius, extremely well put together, chock-full of symbolism and flattish characters and all sorts of other pomo English-majory stuff. Endless riffs on fraudulence and forgery in all their incarnations. There are counterfeiters, quack doctors, plagiarists, and admen. And all that stuff is good, even if a certain distance concerning the characters makes it a little difficult to really like any of them. But what I can't figure out (and this is also the reason it's not one of my favorite books) is why The Recognitions has to be so fucking hostile.Wait, no. First, a few examples of what passes for the \"dazzling wit\" for which The Recognitions is (un)known. And it's not that these aren't funny; they are. But they are so stubbornly academic that it becomes a turnoff after a while.\"--Scatological? --Eschatological, the doctrine of last things... --Good Lord, Willie, you are drunk. Either that or you're writing for a very small audience. --So...? how many people were there in Plato's Republic?\"\"She offered salad; but they were out of whisky.\"\"If it is Meniere's syndrome, we'll have you up staggering around in no time. Of course I don't know where you'll stagger to, with no papers. What's your name? We can't name a disease after you if you don't have a name.\"\"...the Virgin stark in an icon looking like a playing-card queen, the Infant with a hand out as though hailing a passing cab.\" (nothing is safe from Gaddis)\"The separate words were in capital letters, and included: FAITH HOPE CHARITY CONSCIENCE FAIR PLAY COURAGE and HUMBLE.\" (this being, apparently, a joke about less educated folks not using parallel structure on their signage)And yeah, all that stuff is funny, but it's usually buried in mountains of obscure art and literary references and painful line-by-line descriptions of insufferable party-goers and parties. It's really easy to miss stuff. I don't mind a book that demands a second reading, but it should deliver at least some of the proverbial goods the first time around.But Gaddis is also profoundly and obviously misanthropic, and that makes it difficult to get involved with the story, since the story is basically at the expense of all the main characters. And they're all so goddamn pathetic. Wyatt is more or less insane for large parts of the book, Esther is a succubus, Otto is basically the same character as Keating from The Fountainhead, and most of the other characters are either neurotic or criminal. And pretty much none of their arcs conform to the basic plot arcs with which we're so familiar. How clever on Gaddis's part. Too bad no amount of cleverness can replace empathy.But there's no denying that The Recognitions now has a presence for me in a way that only Big Ambitious books can. It was memorable, and carrying it around for 3 months was memorable too, although not in as good of a way. And it both demands and deserves rereading."}, {"userName": "Szplug", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug", "userReview": "The Recognitions\u2014my favourite Gaddis, although he wrote several wonderful books\u2014delves deeply into the theme amongst the most intriguing to me in a novel: exploration of the dichotomy between the increase in both man's material well-being and his spiritual anguish in this, the modern age of consumer capitalism and progressive democracy; an age in which even the sacred and the beautiful are debauched by being made to sell themselves in the ubiquitous marketplace.The principal characters in Gaddis' world are continually forced to make the choice between embracing searing, difficult truths or being seduced by the painless blandishments of an endless parade of fraudulence and forgeries\u2014the latter aptly represented by the constant references to people enthusiastically endorsing Dale Carnegie's seminal mask-making handbook How to Win Friends and Influence People. What is art in the modern age? Is it determined by mass appeal, by those who care less for the inspiration and universality and beauty of a particular piece, and more about whether the in crowd has embraced it, whether it is popular? In such a world, what separates the forger from the creator? Does such a distinction actually matter? Indeed, since even the greatest of artists have stolen from the past, does forgery exist any more as a crime? What is authenticity? Does it become great art if it is born from suffering? Can a world seeking anodyne similarity acknowledge the blood-price and soul-rendering required to capture moments of subcutaneous truth? Do we require God for art to truly exist? It is into this hazy world that we are plunged.And what a terrific stock of characters Gaddis has created for us, too: Wyatt Gwyon, the master forger and tortured soul, sweating blood to make money for himself and others; his father Reverend Gwyon, who, not finding the answers and solace he seeks in Christianity, turns to the worship of the sun-god Mithras; Otto, a plagiarist and dilettante would-be writer and na\u00eff-reedemer, a self-portrait of the author brilliantly realized; the book-ending forger and event-initiator Sinisterra; pious musician Stanely, a spiritual-seeker and creator of a requiem-mass (spoken of highly, though seldom-played); Esme, painter, poet, beauty, the perfect manifestation of the desired virgin-whore; and this just scratches the tip of the rich palette of personalities we are given.The text itself alternates from labyrinthine paragraphs of rich and complex prose, to page-after-page of rapid-fire dialogue\u2014ringing absolutely true, at times disorienting and difficult to follow\u2014the latter a style that would comprise almost the entirety of Gaddis' two-decades-later followup JR. There are many works which tackle this subject, but few which succeed so masterfully, are written in such dense, probing, magnificent language, and are so capable of being both riotously funny and intensely moving as The Recognitions."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher", "userReview": "No, I cannot review this.

What really spurred me on to read it was a fellow Goodreader; Bonnie, whose review of this book is magnificent. Sadly Bonnie died last year and I still miss her wit, wisdom and perspicacity; she survives in her reviews and I would recommend you read her review of this.This is not a book that you can pick up and casually read; it demands work of the reader. However erudite or well read you are you will not get all the references because they are so varied. There are sites available which provide annotated notes so you can follow the references and I would recommend one of these as you can get more out of the whole experience. Gaddis quotes Shakespeare a good deal; there is also a lot of T S Eliot, especially the Four Quartets and The Wasteland. On reflection it is more difficult to list things that are not included! As there is a religious theme running through the book knowledge of the Early Christian Fathers and varieties of theology (not to mention the cult of Mithras) is a necessity (hence the need for a guide). Gaddis also makes reference to a great deal of early twentieth century popular American culture (songs and popular novels). Goethe\u2019s Faust is a backdrop and starting point and the relationship between Wyatt and Recktall Brown is fascinating. The Faust legend goes back to Clementine literature, supposedly written by an early Pope called Clement. Part of this literature is the Clementine Recognitions (hence the title) and here is found the story of Faustus. There are myriads of other references and it is a complex and enthralling work. The story itself is fairly simple; Wyatt means to follow his father into the Christian ministry, but takes to art and forgery for a dealer called Recktall Brown. He becomes disillusioned, his father becomes attracted to Mithras and goes mad and there is a supporting cast of many interesting characters who revolve around Wyatt and his doings. Most of the story is set in New York around Christmas. As stories go it is ok and would rattle along nicely in a 200 page novel. There is humour; the suit of armour, counterfeit money (forgery and what is real figures a lot) and there is tragedy; all the necessary ingredients. The minor characters are excellent; Otto in particular, Agnes Deigh (the play on words of course has meaning). Anselm is fascinating and there is a self-inflicted Abelard moment in a public toilet. So far I\u2019ve managed to avoid saying what I thought of it. The Recognitions is undoubtedly a great novel and it was fun and challenging to read. I loved the trails that Gaddis leaves and following links and it is undoubtedly a literary masterpiece, worthy of its place in all the lists. The \u201cbut\u201d you are sensing is that although I thoroughly enjoyed reading it; I didn\u2019t love it. It didn\u2019t invoke the passion that my favourite novels have, great though it is.

I can't finish reading my reviews the whole way through to even spell check them. I want to write what I mean and be understood. Is there a way to tell the truth as a bell? I want faces, lives, stories, truths, people being real, other people, places. Touching, not owned, not my life. It is my not alone. I know the world is fake, cold, spent.

There was nothing God did not watch over, nothing, and so this \u2026 and so in the painting every detail reflects \u2026 God\u2019s concern with the most insignificant objects in life, with everything, because God did not relax for an instant then, and neither could the painter then. Do you get the perspective in this? he demanded, thrusting the rumpled reproduction before them. -There isn\u2019t any.\u201dI want to tell you that I want this. I think about this all of the time. I write about this all of the time. It's my running into my fire even though I'm going to be wrong, it's going to get me no where. I just want stories to be real. Stories are real. They are everywhere. Some people see the perspective in everything and they can tell that truth.It was the uncircumscribed, unbearable, infinitely extended, indefinitely divisible void where she swam in orgasm, soaring into a vastness away from the heaving indignity of the posture she shared; the world of music so intensely known that nothing exists but the music; it was the world of ecstasy they all approximated by different paths, one world in which temporary residence is prohibited, as the agonies of recall attest: \u201cLove\u2019s dart\u201d that wounds but does not kill; the ill complained of, but prized above every joy and earthly good; \u201csweet cautery\u201d, the \u201cstolen heart,\u201d the \u201cravished understanding,\u201d the \u201crape of love\u201d: in Provencal, conoscenza.

It isn't as bad as people doing work they have no respect for at all. Everybody has that feeling when they look at a work of art and it's right, that sudden familiarity, a sort of... recognition, as though they were creating it themselves, as though it were being created through them while they look at it or listen to it and, it shouldn't be sinful to want to have created beauty?This is all I have ever wanted.Tell them, as the composer predicted, there's nothing left but knowledge and evidence, and art's become a sort of tailbone surviving in us from that good prehensile tail we held on with then.No, people die. There will be another eye, another feeling and God is not dead. I wanted mirrors. I wanted to see something. When they become real to me and people who are real become more real to me because it is all together in me of things that happened. I would want to read How to Make Friends and Influence People to make friends too. The burned sun spots on the retinas when your dream is allowed like when Stanley is alone on the ship to see hard and arms and fire. When you are alone with the god dreams art and you are painting it yourself. It's when you dream your life away instead of what really happens like romantic encounters that never actually happened. You want this, you expect this. Maybe they don't really want the world. Maybe people don't actually want to pry into anyone's life. It doesn't have to mean that. I want the enough part that's not suspicion. I guess they say that this is a girl thing to do to analyze encounters to death until they don't resemble what transpired. It's playing a song in your head until you can get home to listen to it on repeat for hours. One way is painfully better and the other is not enough and it is the best you've got. It's making your own life. Maybe it's wrong or maybe it's trying to live on separate planes. One isn't always as hard as the other. I liked reading about the people interactions and seeing the two sides, like different places to live that's not always as hard as the real one. Who am I kidding? I never want to get married. I love art. I never gave a shit about what anyone expected to happen once they made the art. I'm copying and copying and not living and living for what could be good enough. I want to tell you that is what art is to me. It's a way to not be suspicious. To capture a lost moment, without being suspicious. I want to recognize and make art so that everything can always be like that. I would copy and not even know I was doing it. I'd repeat their faces and try to find everyone. I don't blame anyone.\u201cTragedy was foresworn, in ritual denial of the ripe knowledge that we are drawing away from one another, that we share only one thing, share the fear of belonging to another, or to others, or to God; love or money, tender equated in advertising and the world, where only money is currency, and under dead trees and brittle ornaments prehensile hands exchange forgeries of what the heart dare not surrender.\u201dI'm awfully tired of me going on about what I wanted to say, what I couldn't say, what I meant to say.

After much deliberation, I've settled on 4 stars if only for the simple reason that among the \"must-read, difficult, long novels\" that this book is usually grouped with, I enjoyed it much more than Ulysses (which I gave 3 stars), yet not quite as much as Infinite Jest (which I gave 5 stars). As far as being a difficult read, I found that it also fell between these two novels.Reasons for a 4-5 star rating:1. The audio book by Nick Sullivan was absolutely fabulous. I started reading the tree book and got through about 200 pages before I was afraid I would not be able to keep up the pace and I switched to the audio. I'm so glad I did because the narrator brought these many characters to life. I laughed out loud so many times simply by imagining these characters in my mind as I listened. (Ed Feasly, I'm thinking of you first and foremost!) However, even after listening to the audio I would routinely go back to the book and reread scenes to make sure that what I remember I heard was correct, or for the simple fact that the scene was hilarious and I wanted to reread it. I think the audio and text versions of this book nicely complimented each other.2. I thought this novel was going to mainly be about Wyatt and his forgeries in the art world. Beyond that, I didn't really know what the novel was going to entail. What I got in this novel, though, was a cast of many (supposedly 50+) characters, all somehow involved in their own forgeries - art, writing, advertisement, personal self, and so on. The scope of this novel, the many plots that wound, intersected, and rewound was impressive, to say the least. Some of my favorite scenes in this novel were where parties are being thrown and we get to listen in on the multitude of these characters with their various backgrounds converse with each other, while the night continues on and the liquor flows. 3. Some of the situations the characters found themselves in were just so completely hilarious, I couldn't believe what I was reading. I was pleasantly surprised by the humor in this book.4. I finished this novel a couple of days ago, and I'm still thinking about the fate of the characters and specific scenes. Some were left in the most ridiculous comedic situations, others were left with pathetic sadness. I suspect I will be thinking about these characters for a long time to come.5. Otto.6. Ed Feasly.7. Subplots involving mustaches, severed limbs, Huki-lau's belt, \"Chr-ast\", Fuller's suspicions, arm slings, the list goes on.Reasons for a 2-3 star rating:1. There is a lot of religious stuff in here that just went right over my head. Even referring to a website that contained annotations of the many references, I still didn't understand. I feel like it would be a full-time research project just to understand all of what was thrown in here.2. There were sometimes pages of narration, letters, or monologues where I had absolutely no idea what what being said. It was like I understood the meaning of the individual words, but I didn't understand them strung together as sentences, let alone paragraphs that bled into pages.3. If it were not for the audio book, I probably would have had no idea who was actually speaking in some of the dialogue. There were times where I wondered, after going back to reread sections in the book, how the narrator even knew whose voice he was supposed to be using. I'm sure upon a reread it might become more obvious after having a sense of the cast of characters already on hand.Why I waffled between 4 and 5 starsBecause I can already see myself going back to this book to read (or listen) to certain scenes, chapters, or even big chunks of the book someday.

Gaddis is a major literary talent who hasn't yet even begun to receive the following of which he is worthy. This novel concerns the discoveries, both major and minor, of what is authentic in life: The Recognitions is enlightening, almost beatific, in the way in which it focuses upon the shortcomings and moral lapses of humans in pursuit of true art. From the starving painter whose unappreciated genius leads him to forge Flemish masters to a musician whose copied work played upon a great pipe organ brings down a chapel to counterfeitors of money and plagiarists of drama, this of work of Gaddis is the real thing. It is brilliant, witty, original and his command of the language is breathtakingly stunning in its execution. One can see the influence of James Joyce throughout the writing in an experimental style that is breakthrough. It is incredibly inventive and funny and astonishingly intelligent. It's no wonder that The Recognitions went unrecognized for so tragically long -- Gaddis is, without doubt, one of the top half-dozen of American literary novelists of the 20th century ranking with Bellow, Barth, Vonnegut, Hemingway and Faulkner. The writing is work by a fellow of verifiable genius: I strongly recommend that you to discover Gaddis -- he will enrich your life and help you better understand the nature of the personal epiphanies that give meaning to life."}, {"userName": "Jonfaith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327886-jonfaith", "userReview": "We live in Rome, he says, turning his face to the room again,-Caligula's Rome, with a new circus of vulgar bestialized suffering in the newspapers every morning.

Gwin? Gwy-yon?\u201d (you suddenly realize you don\u2019t really know how to pronounce his surname) \u201cand he forges paintings and is rather strange and...\u201d And you give up. Not to say The Recognitions is plotless, but it definitely doesn\u2019t have a clear direction and is a dense, highly ambitious and probably voluntarily confusing work.The opening chapter is one of the most extraordinary pieces of literature I have ever read. Combining lyrical beauty with a moving study of a child gradually alienating himself from other people whilst learning to paint all by himself, seemingly forgotten by his father, over-shadowed by a bigoted aunt and with only a photograph of his dead mother to remember her. All of this sprinkled with short jabs of satiric humour. I thought to myself: if this holds up for 900 pages this could well become my favourite book. Since you probably saw the three stars I gave it, you can deduce that this was not the case.William Gaddis is undoubtedly a talented writer. There are long polyphonic dialogues that never lose the reader, and an almost surreal humour at times. The way faking paintings becomes a mirror of the hypocrisy of social interactions is an interesting and original theme, you have to admire the research Gaddis went into in order to make the faking process believable.However, he is not always as funny as he thinks. At one point, a movie mogul brandishes his cheque book explaining to one the characters that it once stopped a bullet, thus saving him. It made me laugh, but it also points to the sometimes glaring lack of subtlety and heavy symbolism that pervades the novel (money is the new religion!!! :o :o :o ). This is especially true of the secondary characters, who are more or less allegories of societies' various faults, rather than actual characters. This enables the author to frankly indulge in some very obvious satire, with characters saying stupid things, often trying to pass off as cultured by misquoting something, giving the reader the very uncomfortable feeling of being superior to these characters, whereas in the novel\u2019s best moments (which in my opinion are too rare), it is the reader himself who feels criticized.Some of the main characters are more interesting. Otto especially is a hilarious portrait of a would-be artist and in general his plotline is a great 101 course on what not to do if you want to be a writer. Apparently some of the ridiculous things he does (pretending to have witnessed a revolution in Central America and on his return walking around with an unbroken arm in a sling), are things Gaddis did. Otto\u2019s father, although not often there, is a wonderfully touching, comically tragic character, and also has parallels with Gaddis' father. This doesn't stop Gaddis from being cruel to both of them. Wyatt Gwyon is intriguing at first but is so undecipherable it becomes tiresome. Stanley, a composer working on a mass, seems rather contrived among the other would-be artist figures. Esme come across as extremely irritating. She plays the typical Ever-Elusive Mysterious Female, full of \u201cdisarming\u201d comments, pursued by each artist character because he persuades himself he needs her as his muse (her name is even sort of an anagram of muse, isn't it? isn't it?) or something (except Wyatt coz he's so cool he's the one eluding her). Clich\u00e9d and groan-inducing. The plot itself starts off rather focused but goes all Game of Thrones towards the end: characters jump out of windows, stab each other and emasculate themselves, or else go mad if they aren't already mad. Seems like an easy way to end plotlines to me.Regarding the style, another reviewer pointed out that a character in a George Eliot novel always writes \u201ccommenced\u201d instead of \u201cbegan\u201d. Well, Gaddis does the same thing and it feels pretentious and unnecessary. Much like the tidbits of French (which luckily I understand) and Hungarian (which unfortunately I don't) which seem thrown in to impress the reader more than anything else. I would like to point out that I have nothing against demanding books. I thoroughly enjoyed long and complex works such as Ulysses and Gravity's Rainbow, works that The Recognitions is often compared to (which is why I came to read it), however I always felt that their difficulty and erudition were necessary, whereas here it sometimes (not always) felt superficially tacked on, much like what the characters it is heavy-handedly mocking do.This brings me to another gripe: The Recognitions, to me, is a work of bitterness. There is nothing wrong with being bitter per se if you can communicate it in an entertaining way and make the reader feel that this bitterness is justified, giving the reader a heightened sense of lucidity. Many great satiric works are ferociously, wickedly, viciously funny, such as Catch-22. Yet with Heller, there is a certain warmth and, more importantly, a sense of necessity in his condemnation of warfare and how it is organized. Gaddis' attacks feel often misguided, evil-minded, and so caricatural that they come off as artificial (all atheists are science worshippers), stemming more from Gaddis' personal problems than from reality.To me, The Recognitions, as much as I wanted to like it (especially after that glorious first chapter) is not the scandalously overlooked masterpiece it is hailed as, but an ambitious work by a gifted author who paradoxically seems already full of bitterness from not having had the recognition (no pun intended) he might have deserved, before having actually published the book. I might get back to Gaddis some other time, because The Recognitions is far from being an uninteresting book, but not right now."}, {"userName": "Declan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5848260-declan", "userReview": "Given that The Recognitions ends on Easter Sunday, this would seem to be the perfect day to review a book which is suffused with references to the bible and to manifestations of religious impulses, delusions and repudiations. Somewhere in the rites and wrongs; the tribulations and transubstantiations there is a story about the impossibility of being who we want to be; a profound and, however bizarrely presented, convincing examination of the ontological turmoil which is our lot. More important than the questions raised, on a first reading in any case, is the form the novel takes. Teasing is central to the Gaddis style, both in the sense of teasing out meaning from abstruse references and in the sense of teasing the reader. He pushes us to try harder than we would have to do with a conventional book, but by God, and by Gaddis, it is worth it. As in life, that which is hard-won is appreciated far more than that which is merely given. Nothing in The Recognitions is a given. Almost no detail is delivered without ambiguous implications or an allusion to the shadowing forces of myth, religion or art. Indeed ,you could almost say that, in this 956 page book, nothing is ever said directly; all is implied. Dislocation recurs throughout the novel and doubt is constant: the search for authenticity is central to every action:\"-and so when you're working, it's your own work, Basil Valentine said. - And when you attach the signature?. . .-Yes when I attach the signature, he said dropping his head again, - that changes everything, when I attach the signature and. . . loose it.\"Or, later in the book:\"The love I have from others is not love of me, but where they try to find themselves, loving me. I dream and I wake up, and then at that moment you are somewhere being real to other people; and they are part of your reality; and I am not. . .But you are the only person I am real with. . .\"That desperate search for authenticity is also often demonstrated by very funny displays of inauthenticity:\"Once in my convent school, I remember when we were all sent to look at a reliquary. It was. . .I don't know, a splinter of the cross, or a crumb of something. They even had one they said contained a bit of the original darkness that Moses called down on the world, imagine.\"There is especially sharp humour in the way Gaddis portrays the malleability of his characters presentation of themselves at several large gatherings; terrific set-pieces replete with misunderstanding, pretensions, arguments and people straining beyond their limits to succeed in impressing those they are speaking to. I especially enjoyed the deliberate undermining of these occasions by one set of characters who, before going out, decided on their \"latest arcanum\", a made up word which they would use in several contexts:\"Chavenet. It really doesn't mean anything, but it's familiar to everyone if you say it quickly. They mention a painter's style, you nod and say, Rather. . .chavenet, or, He's rather derivative of, Chavenet, wouldn't you say? Spending the summer? Yes, in the south of France, a little villa near Chavenet.\"A multitude of voices endeavour to be heard above the background drone of other voices, radio ads and music (the soundtrack to this book would be a superb selection of early, baroque and classical music, with some folk and popular songs along the way). Amidst them all, and central to the novel, is Wyatt, painter, forger, never-to-be preacher - almost nowhere called by his name - and unable to form a complete sentence or a coherent, communicable thought. Lost, as all these characters eventually are in - if I may dare to emulate Gaddis for a moment - Fuller's \"black dismal dungeon of despair\" (that's William Fuller (1608-1675), not Fuller the character in the book who works as slave/servant for the indelicately named Recktall Brown!). It is, ultimately, a grim read, but an utterly engrossing and intricate read too. So much of what is possible in a novel is given real, expansive form here and while it may be necessary, sometimes, to read a paragraph twice to untangle its meaning, I always found a basic, underlying coherence in everything Gaddis wrote. Persistence was always rewarded and there is invaluable help here: http://www.williamgaddis.org/. How drab and unimaginative many books will seem after this. The Recognitions is chavenet, utterly chavenet."}, {"userName": "Eddie Watkins", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1131783-eddie-watkins", "userReview": "I'm actually not finished reading this yet. I'm saving the last hundred pages or so, just to savor them. I did the same thing when I read through all of Proust. Sometimes I just don't want to finish a book.This thing sat on my shelf for almost 20 years before I read it. I was intimidated by it, but I also wasn't too turned on by sections I would occassionally read. So it took me 20 years to recognize how wonderful it is. And what's strange is that it was a Recognition. I read somewhere that Harold Bloom called the book uncanny, how strange things happen around it, and then he went on to tell how a copy of it mysteriously ended up in his briefcase. I had a couple uncanny things happen while I was reading it too. Like finding details from dreams of mine from the night before in the book while reading in the morning. And then one time my wife wanted to know how I'd know to come home from a party when she wanted me to come home. I told her I'd wear an alarm clock around my neck set to that time. The day after I told her this a character was introduced in the book whose distinguishing characteristic was that he wore an alarm clock around his neck. It doesn't necessarily mean anything, but I'd still call the coincidence uncanny."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah", "userReview": "I originally wanted some extra time before my comments because I wanted to review the annotations. This is an incredibly confusing book and to be honest, the annotations didn't actually enlighten me. I feel like this is a book that would be impossible to get the most out of without repeated readings. I do believe that I need to reread it at least twice. In ten years or so. It was crazy confusing.I listened to the audio, which was one of the most amazing audios I've listened to. The guy had to narrate 50+ voices and it rarely got confusing. Not only that but when you look at the book it's actually very difficult to figure out who is talking. I can't even imagine the notes and concentration and knowledge that had to have gone into his narration.

I am not an able enough reviewer to really do this book any kind of justice. So I'm just going to say that I loved the experience of reading this. I had both a physical copy and an audiobook. The audio is fantastic. It is narrated by Nick Sullivan and he made the parts of dialog much more understandable but I'm also really glad I had the book because I ended up either reading along with or re reading most of what I listened to. Other books that I have read that come to mind as similar to this are Infinite Jest, Ulysses, and Against the Day. I'm thankful for my friends that I read this with.
