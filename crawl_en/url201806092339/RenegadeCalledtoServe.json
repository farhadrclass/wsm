Renegade is not the type of book I gravitate to (ya think?), and yet it\u2019s so superbly crafted, so flawlessly executed, that I can\u2019t do anything other than give it full marks.Protagonist Pike Morgan is not your ordinary hero. A former foster kid, hidden by the Witness Protection Program, and a Marine, Pike is more than a little rough around the edges. What makes him appealing, though, is how hard he tries to deny his human need for companionship, for relationships, for love. Unsuccessfully, as it turns out. Though his circumstances are about as tough as anyone might imagine, caring people around him draw him inexorably into transformation\u2013into a better version of himself.Renegade, surprisingly, is about the transformative power of love. I know. You wouldn\u2019t guess it by the cover, would you? But this story is about what can happen when genuine compassion surrounds a tough nut\u2026until he cracks. Beautiful.With smooth prose that\u2019s a pleasure to read, Renegade captures a story in a real-world setting, hitting on contemporary faith issues and relevant current events. Really, an altogether impressive read.Thanks to Tyndale for providing me a free copy to review. All opinions are mine."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2623915-patricia", "userReview": "I enjoyed this less than the other military series (Mel Odom's NCIS series) that I just finished. Granted, I didn't read book 1 of this Called to Serve series, so I wasn't as attached to the characters in this book. This seemed more violent than the other series, too. However, there wasn't as much of the weapons' description this go'round, either. Note: there was supposed to be a book 3 released in this series in 2014.

This installment continues the coverage of the Marine Reserve unit introduced in book one but with the focus on Pike Morgan. We learn more of his history and his life outside of the Marines. You will struggle along with Pike as he tries to figure out where he fits into the world. As he struggles with his personal battles he must also battle terrorists in Afghanistan. There is plenty of heart pounding action in this book to keep anyone on the edge of their seat until the final page is turned."}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16793358-deborah", "userReview": "Pike Morgan's childhood in the foster care system has made him rebellious, cynical and hard. His rough exterior and disregard for the judicial system has the police department on his doorstep more often than he would like. With his faith in vigilante justice and himself, Pike is part of the Marine Reservists and it gives him a sense of purpose he wouldn't otherwise have. Eager for another deployment, he is anxious for another tour.When his deployment finally comes, he and his team find themselves in a peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan. What they find is a war zone in a country reaching it's breaking point. When an American journalist is kidnapped, finding the al Qaeda terrorist responsible becomes their top priority. When the terrorist makes a break for neighboring Pakistan, will Pike find himself alone in completing his mission? Or is it too late to save the hapless journalist and convince his team that completing the mission is vital?This was a great second installment in the Called to Serve series by Odom. I was very excited to read a book with Pike being the primary character, and Odom delivers all the fast paced action and adrenaline rush I've come to anticipate. I love how we get a look into the \"bad guys\" perspective and point of view. Everyone has their own reasons for doing things and you almost sympathize with both sides of the story; and at the very least understand what drives and motivates them to action. This is the kind of book you don't want to end because it just was that good.This book was provided by Tyndale House Publishers for free in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8092857-melinda", "userReview": "Renegade by Mel OdomOdom follows Deployed with Renegade. We pick up a few months later and follow Private Pike. He's in Witness Protection trying to bring justice for the death of his only friend. He's a tough case though. He's a Marine Reservist and isn't easy to get along with. The marshals have frustrated him with their procrastination on bring Petey's death to a close. He holds himself aloof from everyone because history proves they won't care for him in the long run.Until a young boy named Hector begins to weave his way in through the few cracks that Pike has. Pike begins a tough battle within himself as he slowly begins to care for Hector, a few fellow Marines, and the occasional person who appears in his life. It's easier to shut his emotions down, but shutting down his emotions creates a monster. Orders to Afghanistan separate him from Hector only to bring him in direct contact with Bekah Shaw. When Pike finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, he determines to shut himself down for good. The problem is that Bekah won't let him close that door.I really enjoyed the story, but I liked the analogy that Odom drew even more. Without losing his story or getting preachy, Odom points out bluntly that you can't have it both ways. You have to choose to care or choose to not care. You can't live forever in a state of flux. Caring leaves you susceptible but it also renders great rewards. As with Deployed, there are still loose ends in Renegade. I'm hoping we return to Bekah, Pike, and Shaw down the road."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21087038-elizabeth", "userReview": "In Renegade, Pike is a tough guy with a past that he keeps hidden. Because of crimes that he and his friend committed, his friend was murdered causing Pike to be in the witness protection program. Pike has been assigned to a neighborhood in Tulsa and though he is a loner, he has become close to a few people: Monty, who is his mechanic boss, Monty\u2019s family, and a young boy named Hector. Pike is also a Marine and he has been assigned to work in Afghanistan to battle the terrorists that have been causing trouble there. While serving on duty there, Pike helps train new Marines, faces combat that tests his mettle, and gets himself in serious trouble when he kills a crooked Afghan Police Officer. Pike is arrested and is thrown into the Brig while the situation is investigated. When it is discovered that the officer was in cahoots with the Russian Mafia, Pike is released to continue to serve the rest of his duty. As Pike and his fellow Marines get closer to finding the terrorist leader, Pike is thrown into combat that cause him to face the affects of his troubled childhood, best friend\u2019s death, and his life in Tulsa. What will Pike do, however? Will he run away from his responsibilities and leave his fellow Marines in the midst of combat? Will Pike deny that he belongs in Tulsa with Monty, Monty\u2019s family, and Hector? Or will Pike find a way to overcome his inner demons and return to Tulsa a changed man? These are just some of the answers that will be answered when you read Renegade."}, {"userName": "Beckie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4780389-beckie", "userReview": "\"Renegade\" by Mel Odom is book two of the Called to Serve series. I haven't read book 1, and though it sounds good, it isn't necessary to read before this one. In \"Renegade\", Pike, a low level criminal is in the witness protection program to testify against the killers of his best friend, Pete. He has been there for three years. Strangely, the witness protection has given him the most stability he has ever known and Pike isn't sure how he feels about that. Pike is also in the Marine reserves. In book 1 of the series, the main character is Bekah, who is Pike's partner while deployed in Afghanistan in book 2. The book takes turns in focus chapter by chapter with Pike being the main character, but the reader is also introduced to Bekah and Yaqub, an al Qaeda leader. Yaqub has kidnapped US CIA agents. The three characters become entangled in the war in Afghanistan.I really liked this book. It is well written, the characters are clear. Pike, though a criminal is still a likable character that the reader becomes invested in. Macho is his middle name. Yaqub is even humanized and clear. I will be reading Book One to catch up and if there is a book 3, I'll read that one too. B+. I received this book from Tyndale Publishing."}, {"userName": "Rayleigh", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23929841-rayleigh", "userReview": "First of all, I want to thank Tyndale Publishers for sending me this book so that I could write this review.Now, this was a very good book. I loved the way it was written and it caused an incredibly crazy and insane adrenaline rush in every chapter! I mean how many people have adrenaline rushes sitting on their bed?!This is a Christian book and has quite a few Christian characters in it that are all telling Pike Morgan, who thinks he is better off without anyone in his life, in different ways that God is in control of his life, although he doesn\u2019t believe it.I have to say that my favorite character is a little boy named Hector. I think he is supposed to be 10 years old, and Mel Odom (the author) gave him an excellent role to play in Pike\u2019s life, as the little boy that makes Pike second guess his solitary life and want to almost forget the past that he wants to dwell in the rest of his life.I would not recommend this book for kids under 13 or 14 years of age, or maybe even 15 based on their maturity level. It is kind of violent and pretty descriptive. However, there was nothing sexually impure in this book, just lots and lots of guns.So, if you like reading about the war and Marines, I recommend this book as good read!"}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19171653-alan", "userReview": "While the story and plot line were very good, I had issues with the technicalities for this book. It seemed as though the author did very little research in to the Marine Corps. Having been in the Marines, as well as my sister, 2 uncles, and grandfather; this made it difficult to not get frustrated. Minor details I can deal with, but there were some glaring issues. A few of them include a female in an infantry unit (this does not happen in real life), Velcro on the uniforms (this happens in the Army, but the Marines do not, because if the patch was caught it would tear away and make noise breaking tactical silence), \"stripes\" for a private (again, this is the Army, and the Marines Corps does not use any insignia for a private, but does use one chevron for a PFC), and an M60 used in Afghanistan (the M60 has not been used since Vietnam, and was replaced by the 240G). There are quiet a few others, but I felt these were the ones that should likely stand out to anyone who did at least a little research."}, {"userName": "Trinity Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3546781-trinity-rose", "userReview": "Renegade by Mel Odom is book two in the series Called to Serve. I didn\u2019t get to read book one and would have liked to. It really would have made the reading experience richer. I enjoyed Renegade and how it showed that war is not a game or something that is just part of life. War is really about death and evil, but sometimes you have to fight to rid the world of evil. If you don\u2019t like war stories or hear about a lot of death then you shouldn\u2019t read this book. I myself usually don\u2019t read about wars, but this one was unique. It shows how some people are driven by their past and how life isn\u2019t always neat and orderly.  Renegade is a modern day war story that is really accurate. I recommend this book for all that love to read about war and things that happen. It is quite an interesting book.Thanks to Tyndale House Publishers for providing this book for review.

This book centers on Pike. Growing up Pike was in and out of foster homes, getting into trouble with his friend and eventually ended up on the witness protection program. He lives in a rough area and takes it upon himself to take care of drug dealers, yet finds time to help a young boy with his homework. Pike is also a Marine. In this book he is deployed to Afghanistan where he is involved in fighting and searching for a terrorist leader. I like this book, is it a little slow moving in the beginning but picks up once Pike is deployed. Other key members in the first book are brought back in this book. There is violence but also caring in this book. This book leaves a lot unanswered, it advertises a conclusion book to be printed in 2014, however, I cannot locate it anywhere. I hope it is printed soon."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6898915-hannah", "userReview": "Renegade by Mel Odom is the second book in the Called To Serve series.
