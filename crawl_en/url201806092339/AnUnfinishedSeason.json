A 60-year-old narrator in the early 1990s recalls a summer in the 1950s in a voice that sounds like F. Scott Fitzgerald memorializing the 1920s. It's not so much that you can't put it down, but that you shouldn't put it down because the moment you stop reading, the spell breaks and you're left with the aftertaste of pretentious insight.For Wilson Ravan, the summer before college was a time of momentous change. His wealthy family lives in a rural town on the North Shore of Chicago, removed from both the high society and the industry of the city. His father is a powerful man who owns a printing company. His mother is a brittle woman with nothing to do but cook and knit.After years of paternalistic management, the printing plant suffers a strike that shocks Mr. Ravan and breaks his confidence. Cold-war paranoia quickly transforms a dispute about salaries and bonuses into a cosmic battle, a face-off between a hardworking American owner and godless strikers controlled by their evil bosses in the Soviet Union.With his liberal prep-school education, 19-year-old Wilson sees all this as political hyperbole, but when his father starts carrying a gun and a brick flies through their window, his amusement is displaced by awe. \"I was watching him,\" Wilson says, \"in order to learn what it was to be a man, with a man's burdens, how to behave in adversity.\"That's a typically slippery comment from this maddening narrator, who oozes earnest sincerity and weighty import. Yes, he watches his father to learn what it is to be a man, but only the way Jane Goodall watches gorillas. No matter how much Wilson admires the man's strength or cherishes his advice on alcohol and women, he remains fundamentally superior. Even when he laments his own ignorance, it's in such grandiose terms that he sounds burdened with special wisdom.Wilson is that most treacherous of friends (and narrators), the humble, self-effacing observer who wants only to witness and understand the challenges other people face. Through his father's connections, he gets a summer job at a scrappy downtown newspaper where he relishes the wheeling and dealing of city life, soaking up the secret details of stories that never make it into print.But there's a craving, unseemly quality to how much he loves this job, watching the \"carnival of love nests, revenge killings, slumlords, machine draft, and Communists deep in the apparatus of state and national government.\"After work, he lurks around city bars, listening to jazz with soulful sensitivity no other white man could match.And in the evenings, he adopts his bon vivant persona, dons a tuxedo from Brooks Brothers, and attends an endless stream of debutante balls lifted from \"The Great Gatsby,\" complete with a revival of the Charleston.At one of these parties, he falls madly in love with a similarly precocious young woman and gets swept up into a family tragedy from World War II that's completely beyond his ability to comprehend or negotiate.Wilson claims, \"I was inhabiting three parallel worlds: the newspaper, the parties, and the house.\" But in fact, he inhabits only one: his own romantic voice, full of gorgeous despair, a bubble of sepia tones.\"I knew I was traveling from one realm to another, crossing the line that divided youth from maturity, and that this moment had tremendous weight and that I would refer to it often and that later on it would have more than one meaning.\"Tremendous weight, indeed. Poor Wilson carries a load of such moments, polished into little gems from years of fondling. What's most unnerving about this novel is that the author so rarely tips his hand or breaks through his narrator's overwrought sensitivity to let us know that he, too, finds all this a bit rich.\"I shivered in the chill,\" Wilson says, \"looking at the constellations and Chicago's sulfurous glow on the Southern horizon, wishing to God I was five years older.\" But with a voice like this, if he were five years older, he'd be collecting Social Security.It's such a pleasure when, on Wilson's last day at work, the editor turns on him suddenly and unleashes a biting critique of the young man's disdain for concrete information, his affection for mystery and affect. Utterly unfazed, Wilson walks away from the newsroom, rhapsodizing the wonders of gritty Chicago life, and spends the afternoon looking at Impressionist paintings at the Art Institute. It's a wonderful irony, completely lost on Wilson, who knows so much and so little at the same time.An epilogue 40 years later shows Wilson as a career diplomat for the United Nations, the perfect job for a man burdened by a sense of superior insight and the desire to mediate others' complex lives.\"I have never had the slightest illusion that I could bend the world to my will,\" he tells us in the closing pages, \"and I refused to bend to the world's, so I have lived a kind of shadow life.\"I want to think that Just intends the irony here, but the luxurious lines that Wilson gets to deliver all the way to the end about the romantic tragedy of his life suggest otherwise. \"I was the mariner who had seen the surface of the sea,\" he sighs, \"but had no knowledge of life beneath it.\" If you fall in love with that voice, as the author did, \"The Unfinished Season\" is a moving and beautiful reminiscence of a time of great change.\"I was 19 years old,\" he writes, \"and that was my view of things after my circus summer.\" The self-conscious artifice of this testimony makes that an essentially dishonest claim.http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0706/p1..."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3548900-lauren", "userReview": "Set in 1950s Chicago (and its environs), this is a coming-of-age tale that hints at being something great but instead falls into worn-out plotlines (in the past year, I can recall reading at least two other novels with similar plots and resolutions). The story of nineteen-year-old Wils Ravan hits the ground running with a unique style and a plot and setting interwoven so as to suggest a richly nuanced story. The promising start, however, gives way to drawn-out introspection and wisps of something substantial before sputtering to a clich\u00e9d ending. There\u2019s some truly beautiful writing here and some keen insights into the tension of the 1950s, but they\u2019re little more than window dressing. If anything, as a reader, I resent a writer thinking a few bells and whistles will make me consider a book serious literature when it has all the trappings of a nighttime soap opera. In short, this is merely one more story about rich teenagers encountering Real Life and discovering Real Life is harder than it seems. Not recommended."}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie", "userReview": "I love the work of Ward Just. Every work I have read of his has been a gift, a wonderful surprise. An Unfinished Season is another example of his amazing skill and talents. It recounts the summer of 19 year old Wils, a North Shore Chigoan in the 1950s. Wils has a summer job working for a newspaper before going to the University of Chicago. He falls in love with Aurora Brule, a sophisticated and strong-willed young woman. In the background are the parents-Wils' father, fighting the union at his factory and Aurora's father, a successful psychiatrist who speaks little but whose presence powerfully shadows Wils and Aurore's relationship.The book is about the choices we make before we are experienced enough to understand what we're choosing and choices we make when we're overwhelmed by the experiences we have had.Just is a subtle and perceptive writer. Beyond that, his prose is exquisite. I don't understand why Just isn't more fussed about-he's about the most fabulous writer I've read."}, {"userName": "Hol", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/979843-hol", "userReview": "I was slow getting into this, in part because of style. A paragraph can last a couple pages (in one case, a chapter\u2019s length); at times I found myself drifting into Editorial Mind, imagining where I would break it. Also, the author doesn\u2019t set off dialogue with quotation marks, so it can be an effort to differentiate it from other text. But my larger problem was that the first half of the book felt like it was populated with male \u201ctypes\u201d--the taciturn father, the salty guys in the newsroom, etc. Yawn. Later, however, when the narrator meets his girlfriend and her father, the story felt suddenly alive and engaged with larger themes. After that I was engrossed. I wish I didn\u2019t have these complaints, because Just is such an accomplished writer; the setting (Chicago in the 1950s) is magnificently realized. There\u2019s also an epilogue set decades later, almost epic but done with a light touch, that was so good it nearly overrode my earlier ambivalence."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134021-david", "userReview": "A story of a young man coming of age, caught in between worlds, incapable of using quotation marks."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4154828-susan", "userReview": "\u201cAn Unfinished Season\u201d is the third of what Just calls his \u201cIllinois cycle\u201d of novels. Published in 2004, it was a finalist for the 2005 Pulitzer Prize.Set in the Eisenhower/McCarthy Era years (Adlai Stevenson and Marlon Brando make cameo appearances), first-person narrator Wils lives with his mother and father in Quarterday, Ill., in the same direction from Chicago and the opulent North Shore suburbs as the real Half Day, Ill. Even though he is decidedly middle class, Wils has attended an exclusive North Shore prep school and spends his summers as the guest of various wealthy families hosting the traditional rounds of decadent summer parties.Wils lands a summer job after prep school graduation at a Chicago tabloid where he learns enough insider daily gossip to entertain others at the parties. As Wils tells the reader, \u201cNorth Shore girls knew nothing of the ambiance of a big-city newspaper devoted to sexual mischief, crime, life\u2019s terrors, a chronic melancholy among the city\u2019s down-and-out.\u201d But he could enlighten them.While making the party scene rounds, Wils meets Chicago-dweller Aurora, graduate of an exclusive Chicago school \u2013 probably Frances Parker, though Just does not name it. Wils' relationships with Aurora and her father, a divorced psychiatrist Aurora has chosen to live with over her mother, affect Wils as no other relationships have. He says he feels like the King of Chicago and finds himself addicted to her, making plans for the future despite her going to an East Coast university in the fall while Wills will enter the University of Chicago.As the first-person narrator, Wils lets the reader into his innermost thoughts and I often wondered to what degree these reflective sections are autobiographical to Just. For example: \u201c\u2026I was preoccupied with my own life, my summer job at one of the newspapers downtown, and my strenuous after-hours carousing. The summer had turned out better than I ever imagined, and I realized soon enough that I was inhabiting three parallel worlds: the newspaper, the parties, and the house in Quarterday.\u201dThe final chapter is a kind of Epilogue, catching up with Wils 41 years after the bulk of the novel takes place. In this chapter, one character says, \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to infer the author\u2019s life from the author\u2019s fiction.\u201d Here, perhaps Just answers my question about the degree of autobiography present\u2026or perhaps he just protests too much.For me, \u201cAn Unfinished Season\u201d is a coming-of-age novel reminding me of Holden Caulfield and Jay Gatsby. I\u2019m fascinated by Wils and his experiences in the city and suburbs in the decade and some before I moved to the Chicago area. There\u2019s enough about journalists to keep me interested and not too much about politics to put me off. And there\u2019s lots and lots about a young man sorting out his identity.The Pulitzer folks got it wrong in 2005. They selected Marilynne Robinson\u2019s \u201cGilead.\u201d I would have chosen \u201cAn Unfinished Season\u201d in a heartbeat."}, {"userName": "Timothy Bazzett", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5491319-timothy-bazzett", "userReview": "Ward Just's AN UNFINISHED SEASON is not at all what I'd expected. It was better. It is a coming-of-age kind of story, but several cuts above most books of that sort. Just brings a kind of sophistication and artistry seldom seen in books about growing up and falling in love. Granted there is the knowledge and heartbreak that often comes with hindsight in such matters, but (and I wish I had a little more sophistication in describing this beautiful book) Jeeze, this is one helluva story!Set in Chicago and its northern suburbs in the early fifties, the McCarthy years, the Rosenbergs, Boss Daley, the heyday of great newspapers and reporting - all that stuff is in here, along with a fine and varied cast of complex and realistic characters, from its young hero, Wils Ravan, his parents, his bosses at the paper, his girlfriend, Aurora, and her sad and disturbed psychiatrist father (a survivor of the Bataan death march). And it all flows together so naturally. It keeps you pausing to consider a particularly good turn of phrase, but also keeps you turning the pages to learn what will happen next.Just's uncanny ability to recreate a sense of place and era brought to mind at least two other writers I have read with great enjoyment - one is the late Frederick Busch, who was, I believe, a close friend of Just's. The other is Larry Watson, closer to my own age, but whose skill in the aforementioned skills of place and time - as well as fascinating and fully realized characters - were so very evident in his first and most recent novels, MONTANA 1948 and AMERICAN BOY. But Ward Just is also totally unique in his style and subjects. I'm only two books into his works so far - so many more yet to read, I know. But I'm sure gonna try.

Ward Just could be compared to some of the greatest...F.Scott Fitzgerald, D. H. Lawrence, Graham Green, just to name a few. Just is extraordinary at capturing a vocabulary that takes you into his story where you feel intimately involved with his characters. The Unfinished Season gives you a masterful look at what deb parties and the high society looks like in the early 1900's Chicago. The main character Wils is 19 years old, a senior and a college bound kid. The story takes us into his life and the intimate details of what a 19 year old sees in his parents, relatives, neighbors, friends, society, government and the world, The read is mesmerized by his innocence and perceptions on his world. The book is rich with lines that describe how Wils life is shape by his parent yet you feel his pulling away and his need for independence like every newcomer to College. Just allows the reader to take a part in the richness and innocence of his newfound friend Aurora, who has a dream to live in Greenwich Village. Just seems to remind us of how precious our relationships are and how fleeding they can be.

A coming-of-age story written as if Hemingway and Fitzgerald had a precocious yet clueless love child, this self-conscious dip into class, family and culture issues in 1950s Chicago and the North Shore is narrated by a strangely middle-aged nineteen year-old who speaks like no other nineteen year-old ever has or ever will. Much is supposed to be gleaned from very little plot, so the whole thing feels portentous without any actual portent. Unfortunate, really, because apart from the faux Nick Adams tone some of the writing is nice."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "Just, Ward. AN UNFINISHED SEASON. (2004). ****.\tJust is one of those writers who makes sure that he has exactly the right word for what he is trying to tell the reader about. In this novel, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2005, Just tells the story of Wilson (Wils) Ravan, a nineteen-year-old young man who lives in a Chicago suburb called Quarterway. Wils has just completed high school and plans to move on to the University of Chicago. The summer of that year, a year in early 1950s, is the last one he will have before the realities of life begin to weigh on his existence. Wils\u2019 family is reasonably well off. His father owns a printing and stationary company which is doing quite well. The first tragedy to strike, however, comes in the form of a workers\u2019 strike against his father\u2019s company. The strike escalates and the family is threatened, with phone calls being made anonomously and a brick being thrown through the window of their house. This changes the tone of the relationships within Wils\u2019 household, and forces Wils to take a close look at his own sense of values that guided his life and choices thus far. One of Wils\u2019 major activities during this summer was attending debutante dances for all the emerging young women of stature on Chicago\u2019s North Shore. He is even fitted out with dancing shoes. At one of these events, he meets a young woman, Aurora, who fits seamlessly into Wils\u2019 core beliefs about life and distinctions about right and wrong. Aurora lives with her father, a psychiatrist who, we later learn, was a survivor of the Bataan Death March. When Wils meets her father, Jack, he realizes that he has encountered a man with secrets, but one with profound insights into human behavior. There was only one meeting, but its effects on Wils were profound. We follow the relationship between Wils and Aurora through the summer, until tragedy strikes, and both of them have to re-evaluate themselves vis-a-vis their partner. Just manages to peel back the outward behavior of his characters to reveal a great number of inner truths about them and of people in general. All of this is done within a framework of a historical period in America where the country was also looking for truths to live by.

I had yet to find a narrative to my life, certainly no narrative that advanced in any coherent order or in which I played anything but a winning cameo role, kid brother or newsroom ranconteur. It did not seem to me that you could fashion a life until you could make the decisions that governed it. Until that time you lived quietly in your father's house.\"As I started reading this book, my first by Ward Just, I just kept saying to myself \"this book is beautifully written....and I couldn't care less.\" Initially, reading this book was painful. A couple of pages a day here and there until one day I realized I was on page 50 and didn't want to set this book down. I can't say that there was a specific inciting incident that made the turn from boredom to interest. It crept up on me slowly. Much like when summer is coming to an end and you realize nightfall comes earlier each day. You don't notice it happening, you just acknowledge it as a fact.This is the coming of age story of Wils, set in the Eisenhower Midwest. We view his family, community, daily events and first love through his inexperienced eyes. You have preconceived ideas about your parents and their relationship, think that no one has had thoughts or feelings as original as yourself, and plan for the future as if you can see it clearly, plotted on a map. Little do you know at 19 what awaits you and how little control you seem to have at times.\"naturalness was as elusive as smoke - so vivid one moment, vanished the next - and you remained in your own bed alone, waiting for something magical to happen, as surely as it would, tomorrow or the next day. The Midwest was so furtive, so enormous, the horizon line stretched to the limits of the known world. But there was no space to breathe.\"I have only two complaints that forced me to rate this book3 stars.The first was as previously stated, the seemingly long build up to any sort of plot at the beginning.Secondly, I could have completely done without the ending. I would have been much more pleased if the storyline ended with Wils return to his home late at night after the death of his girlfriend's father. I absolutely did not care for the fast forward to Wils seeking out and visiting Consuela 40 years later. I didn't need to know what happened in the future to these characters, what the fight between Consuela and Aurora's father was about, etc. It added nothing for me and felt a little like the author was trying to give us insight and complexities to the characters that really was not needed.Having said all of the above, I am intrigued enough to look for and read another Ward Just book. After all, I love his phrasing and word choices- again beautifully written!\"Everything came with a cost, and the cost was not always apparent. Win the girl, win the lottery, win the golf match, win the strike; and always there was something leftover, a residue you did not count on or even imagine. Winning was never the only thing; often, it wasn't anything.\""}, {"userName": "Nicholas Bouler", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59864341-nicholas-bouler", "userReview": "I would call this, as a compliment, an old-fashioned novel.

The narrator, Wils Ravan, is a priviliged nineteen year old who is spending his last summer of adolesence before starting college in the fall. Wils moves uneasily between three distinct worlds--his family homestead at the fictional, semi-rural Quarterday; the upscale North Shore communities of Lake Forest and Winnetka and their high society functions and debutante balls; and the raucous, vibrant, no-holds-barred city desk of the dying scandal-sheet newspaper where Wils works a summer job as a go-fer. He never feels fully comfortable in any of the three worlds--not at home, where he feels the widening distance between himself and his parents; not on the North Shore, where he's considered somewhat of a country bumpkin, despite his family's wealth; and not at the newspaper, where the editor and reporters think of him as just a spoiled rich kid who's slumming in the job he got through family connections. The closest he ever comes to being fully comfortable is with his first real girlfriend, Aurora, with whom he moves easily through the streets of the Gold Coast, even as he fears for their future in the fall, when he will enroll at the University of Chicago but she will depart for college in New York.Just's characters are masterfully drawn. Besides Wils, there's his dominating father, owner of a highly successful printing plant whose faith in his business is shattered by a bitter labor strike; his mother, an East Coast elite who has never been wholly comfortable in a Midwestern backwater like Quarterday; the headstrong, uncoventional Aurora, to whom he's first drawn to as neither totally fits in amongst the North Shore socialities; Aurora's father, Jack Brule, a renowned psychiatrist (albeit at a time when \"head doctors\" were still viewed with suspicion) and WWII hero who's still fighting the emotional damage of surviving the Bataan Death March; and Jack's exotic, Cyprus-born girlfriend Consuela. Even Just's minor characters stand out, particularly several of Wils' older colleagues at the newspaper.In a novel which is full of beautifully rendered scenes, one stands out to me, in particular. Having missed connections with Aurora at the Art Institute, Wils finds himself in one of the galleries, pondering over the works of the great impressionists.I had the newspaper office in mind and regretted that Manet or Degas was not familiar with the m\u00e9tier, tobacco smoke in the air, phones ringing, the floor trembling when the presses began to turn, the reporter with his long fingers resting on the keys, the letters of the alphabet motionless as corpses on slabs until the reporter's fingers began their tango. From the look in the writer's eyes, an artist might suggest the life behind the m\u00e9tier and from the frayed shirt cuffs something else and from the shapeliness of his wrists something more still, and at once a world was illuminated...I looked at the faces and tried to find a newspaper reporter, but the only face that fit was the barmaid's. She had seen much of life and that included her own life, and what she had seen was not encouraging. I had noticed the thousand-yard stare on the faces of reporters trying to compose the first sentence of their \"piece,\" the \"lede\" that would bring a look of sour satisfaction to Ozias Tilleman's face; and then the editor would correct a word and add a comma, brushstrokes from the master of the number one pencil.Just's close familiarity with his characters--several of them clearly drawn from real life--and his Chicago settings show his obvious love for both, and serve to create a rich, vibrant novel of a bygone era. An Unfinished Season is simply lovely, one of the finest novels it has been my pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "I felt a little cheated by this book. It started so well. The rich brat of a narrator's father faces union trouble in his publishing business in the height of the red scare, in the 50s. His fellow businessmen watch like hawks, since it might be them next. The narrator is 19, about to go to college, but he has landed an unlikely summer job at a newspaper, where he gets to work with blue collar men whose way of living he knows nothing of, reporting about Chicago's unending nightly bloodletting.About a quarter way through the book, the strike comes to nothing. The parents take a vacation in Havana, and the narrator introduces us to the person he says has changed his life. And given all the options above, I didn't figure it would be a garden variety manic pixie dream girl. That's exactly who it is, though. I would have understood if she turned him around from his privileged life and made him a labor leader or something. But, he goes on to do the very things he was supposed to have done in the first place, so I didn't even see how she changed his life.It was disappointing, because I really did like Just's style of writing, when he was writing about a seedier Chicago. I might have cared for the narrator and his nightly stream of parties if there was something more to it than that. The girl had an interesting background, and it somehow comes to naught. She turns him away for reasons I couldn't understand, as grandiose as it was made to sound on paper, to me it came across as overwrought.

Initially I worried the novel was going to be a Midwestern take on Fitzgerald, but it turned out to be more original than that. My favorite part of the book wasn\u2019t the plot--this is a coming-of-age novel--but the style. There are no quotations throughout which could be confusing.

Perhaps he had said all he had to say about the way of the world and how a man conducts himself in it, or anyhow all that could be said over a hand of pinochle to a nineteen-year-old.

Who would not wish that it were so? With today's emphasis on life planning and bucket lists, we seem to be more convinced of a conscious shape for the future and a better chance to make up for the past. Maybe so.Ward Just may not see it that way. In this very compelling book, a now mature man looks back at his 19th summer, his first love, his first job and his parents and tries one last time to tie it all together. What is \"unfinished\" here? His father's dreams as he skates on the pond behind their home thinking of the confident convictions of his own youth? His mother's dogged determination to clone the world of her privileged childhood? The boy's own attempt to give meaning to a singular moment in life? Even the city of Chicago, raw and boisterous, looking to the sophisticated meccas of San Francisco and New York? So as you read this absorbing novel, you have the privilege of also wondering how much life is linear and how much is a circle that can be closed. I am a fan of Just's, who captures perfectly for me American culture for the upper classes in mid-20th century. He does that because it is a world that he knows, not because he wants to hold a class or individuals up to ridicule, but because they have lives full of love, hope and failure that he knows how to describe very well."}, {"userName": "Alison Hardtmann", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28105228-alison-hardtmann", "userReview": "An Unfinished Season is Ward Just's coming of age story set in Chicago of the 1950s. The year before Wils goes off to college is the year his father sees his control of his business challenged as his workers strike. His mother is frightened and his father begins carrying a gun in a duffel he carries everywhere with him. Wils gets a summer job at a local Chicago paper and spends his time juggling two worlds; the gritty, hyped up atmosphere of the newsroom and the genteel debutante parties he attends several times a week. He's not sure what he wants to do with his life, but he knows he doesn't want to follow along the well worn paths set for the well-heeled sons of the affluent families of the North Shore. More than the story itself, the center of this book is the city of Chicago and the atmosphere of the 1950s. Just writes beautifully, and here he puts his skills to work describing the politics and manners of a world just beginning to change. Wils is less important than he thinks he is, but what nineteen-year-old is, and its through his eyes we get a snapshot of the world at a very specific time and place. Just is an underappreciated writer of great skill and heart and I'm always happy to read one of his books."}, {"userName": "Armand", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188248-armand", "userReview": "For some reason it took me a while to get into this one \u2013 I must have read a few pages and put it down a dozen times. I don\u2019t know why, exactly. The writing is tight and I\u2019m a sucker for a story with a strong sense of place (here, Eisenhower-era Chicago). Thankfully something kept me coming back, and by the end, almost without my noticing, Just had built a taught, emotional story, with characters I cared about deeply. There\u2019s a melancholy to Just\u2019s portrait of a summer in Chicago and to the main character\u2019s otherwise bright station: 19 years old, on the cusp of his freshman year at the University of Chicago. But this isn\u2019t an ordinary 19 year old; he sharply processes his different worlds, from debutante parties on the North Shore to the newsroom where he interns, to say nothing of the tenuous emotional landscapes of his parents\u2019 home or his new girlfriend\u2019s family. He is privileged, but drawn to underworld jazz clubs and stories of the oppressed. This is a smart novel that manages to elegantly address the slow-building intensity of growing up and the creeping feeling that some events may linger a lifetime. Definitely recommended."}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6954319-joanne", "userReview": "I am so pleased to have discovered author, Ward Just. Loved this book which is set in Chicago in the 50's as young Wil is spending the summer working downtown Chicago for a newspaper.

Finds he doesn't fit in, as the newsroom crowd view him as a party going rich kid headed to the University of Chicago.Tales of Wil's coming of age as he attends many parties and finally meets a girl he thinks is \"the one.\"Wil continues to try to find out what makes the world and society tick, and is frequently baffled at the actions of people and the stumbling blocks of people with money and the working class.You have only to read page one, and you realize this author is a cut above.

His father's business (and reputation) is floundering as the result of a nasty labor strike at his printing business and his mother is alienated by a distant husband and the terminal illness of her father. What lies ahead during the summer in-between graduating from high school and his Freshman year at the University of Chicago is an exotic (to him) job as a go0fer at a third-rate tabloid newspaper and a dizzying round of debutante parties in the north shore Chicago suburbs.At one of these parties he meets Aurora Brule, the daughter of a prominent psychiatrist, but also the product of a dysfunctional family. Of course they are destined to come together. However, when tragedy strikes, Wilson must grow up quickly, and he finds that life hardly ever turns out to be like one dreams it will be.Ward Just gets the period atmosphere just right & tells this coming of age story with perception and grace."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9141677-paul", "userReview": "A pleasant, but not especially exciting, book. Reading it is like having dinner with a self-absorbed academic in late middle age -- interesting if you pay close attention, but your host seems so content with his own company that you wonder why he bothered to invite you. The novel concerns the 19th summer of Wilson Ravan, an upper-middle-class kid from Chicago's northern suburbs (but not the North Shore -- he takes pains to make the distinction) who observes his parents endure marital difficulties, works at an urban newspaper, and dates an unhappy debutante with a neurotic veteran for a father. That's a lot of detail, but the book never feels dense or rushed, in part because Just writes such smooth, breezy prose, in part because Ravan is so detached from all these occurrences that they never become vivid. In fact, young Wilson is so cognizant of the transience of his experiences that he doesn't seem to change at all. Not really sure why this book was a Pulitzer finalist, unless Ward Just has a lot of friends. Maybe. He seems like an okay guy."}, {"userName": "Kurtis T.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25893862-kurtis-t", "userReview": "Kurtis T. BellBook ReviewAn Unfinished SeasonAn Unfinished Season is an American novel by Ward Just. This novel is a very deep novel, feels just like a Soap Opera . During the Eisenhower era, a teenager soon to be adult name Wildrow Wilson grows up learning for his father and personal experience en route into becoming a man. This novel will resemble the liking of a movie as you read it.\tWhat I like about this book, is how realistic the dialogue, it actually seem like the book was non-fiction and autobiography. Plus the book dealt with real situations at the time Post WWII and the Mob in Chicago. What I also like about the novel is the growth of Wildrow, how he became a teenager trying to have fun into becoming a successful man. What I dislike was how the book has mix emotions.\tAt the end of day, this was a good book overall. This book is actually an adult book and is for adult. I recommend this book to late \u2013teens and adults."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/214910-sarah", "userReview": "Beautiful.

It took a long time for me to get going with this book, owing mainly to my drowsing off after 3 pages when I would pick it up just before bed.But a conveniently timed trip to Atlanta gave me the good solid chunk of hours needed to get going, and once I got passed the narrator\u2019s initial account of his family life and to the main story, which is that of his experiences over one summer attending debutantes\u2019 balls on the North Shore of Chicago while working in the seedy newspaper business, the book became much more palatable.

He gets involved with a girl also headed off to an expensive University and all the drama that comes with the social scenes of the young living in a pampered reality. The story seemed to meander from business troubles with a strike, his parents marriage struggles, a death of a relative to romance and death. Once the climax of the story happened, the author seemed to take his tale until he ran out of paper. The ending was very dissatisfying and left me wondering why he chose the angle he did.

Even the small-town family could not escape the nationwide suspicion and dread of \"the enemy within.\" In rural Quarterday, on the margins of Chicago's North Shore, nineteen-year-old Wilson Ravan watches as his father's life unravels. Teddy Ravan -- gruff, unapproachable, secure in his knowledge of the world -- is confronting a strike and even death threats from union members who work at his printing business. Wilson, in the summer before college, finds himself straddling three worlds when he takes a job at a newspaper: the newsroom where working-class reporters find class struggle at the heart of every issue, the glittering North Shore debutante parties where he spends his nights, and the growing cold war between his parents at home. These worlds collide when he falls in love with the headstrong daughter of a renowned psychiatrist with a frightful past in World War II. Tragedy strikes her family, and the revelation of secrets calls into question everything Wilson once believed.From a distinguished chronicler of American social history and the political world, An Unfinished Season is a brilliant exploration of culture, politics, and the individual conscience.", "title": "An Unfinished Season", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123618.An_Unfinished_Season", "average": 3.45, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348819526l/123618.jpg", "reviews": 116, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/150037.Ward_Just", "name": "Ward Just"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Novels", "Young Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123618.An_Unfinished_Season", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1292470.An_Unfinished_Season", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2365979.An_Unfinished_Season", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169551.Forgetfulness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169556.Echo_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18222776-american-romantic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9673935-rodin-s-debutante", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6251346-exiles-in-the-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
