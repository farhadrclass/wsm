Both grew up in very different ways and expected to live their lives accordingly. There was quite a bit of character growth as we see Jack struggling to come to terms with so much of his life and his past. Bobbie just graduated from Smith where she was meant to eventually marry a man of means to take care of her. She decides that she'd like to eventually be President of the United States. Meanwhile she has a job at Larkin and eventually working for the boss. She uses her knowledge and seems to find her niche. Except she seems wishy washy at times and second guesses herself. She's quick to just up and leave instead of confronting a problem. When sparks fly between the two can they get over their differences to find out what things they share in common? Can Jack trust Bobbi to really let her in on his deepest secret? Can the richest man under 40 find true love? His way of life is so different than she's been used to. Will she lose herself and her ultimate dreams in all of this, or will she finally choose herself and what she wants? Can they compromise and both get what they want or is that possible?While I enjoyed the book, it was not one of my favorites. It was worth the read. I would like to mention that it did not end like I thought it would. Which was a good in this case because I could see the infinite loop of how things would always play out. I did like to see the growth in their characters and how they were able to make good choices for themselves and others around them."}], "description": "It is 1968, everyone is young, and the boy who was dubbed by Time magazine the richest American under the age of forty when he was only twenty-six is still waiting to take control of his inheritance. Into his sheltered and sadly damaged life comes Bobbi Christian, fresh out of college, lovely and carefree and full of dreams. Alone among the girls who are rotating through Jack Richardson's employ, Bobbi - he soon renames her \"Vixen\" - is not impressed with him. She treats him like a normal boy, and she treats her job with him as an opportunity to learn a lot as she prepares to go to law school so she can become the first woman President of the United States. Then Jack and Vixen fall hard for one another. As she assists him in managing his final trusteeship year before he claims his inheritance at thirty, they fallever more intensely in love. She helps him begin to overcome the disabling effects of a traumatic childhood, and she is instrumental in effecting the healing that allows him at last to step into and claim the wealthy life that is his birthright. As Jack becomes more fully the man he always has known that he was born to bo, his beloved begins to reconsider her own dreams.", "title": "Jack in Love", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33114620-jack-in-love", "average": 4.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1479921451l/33114620.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/589440.Roberta_Grimes", "name": "Roberta Grimes"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33114620-jack-in-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9243116-the-fun-of-dying", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26842432-liberating-jesus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28486708-the-fun-of-dying", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20299989-my-thomas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23136458-the-fun-of-staying-in-touch"]}
