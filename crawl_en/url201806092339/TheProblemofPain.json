It was called Happy Valley, and it was ruled over by a wise old king called Otto.

The Problem of Pain focuses on one question, but thoroughly argues on every aspect.\n\"If God were good, He would make His creatures perfectly happy, and if He were almighty He would be able to do what he wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\"\nIn other words, why would an all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-loving God allow people to experience pain and suffering?Firstly, Lewis set his arguments by identifying God, as conceivable as possible, and his purpose through the subject of divine omnipotence and divine goodness. He argued that since we are beings of free souls and have the luxury of free will, we take advantage of the fixed laws of nature to hurt ourselves and one another. Yet, even though God is omnipotent and can do whatever he pleases, removing pain leads to a meaningless universe.\n\"Nonsense remains nonsense even if we talk it about God.\"\n\n\"Try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free-wills involve, and you will find that you have excluded life itself.\u201d\nGod\u2019s idea of good is unlike ours; His moral judgment must, therefore, differ from ours. Where God means love, we only mean Kindness. But love is not mere kindness. Let us have a mental note how much confusion between love and kindness is related to our modern thinking.\n\"Kindness cares not whether its object becomes good or bad, provided only that it escapes suffering\", while Love \"would rather see [the loved ones] suffer much than be happy in contemptible and estranging modes\".\nRecognizing the distinction between love and kindness illuminates what it means to be the object of God\u2019s love. Because God loves us, he will not rest until we are purely lovable. To not want pain, therefore, is to not want His love.\n\"Love, in its own nature, demands the perfecting of the beloved; that the mere 'kindness' which tolerates anything except suffering in its object is, in that respect, at the opposite pole from Love.\"\nNext, he establishes his argument for the total corruption and the sin nature of man, as without a sin nature there is no reason to be corrected. How a bad creature could come from the hands of a good Creator? The most obvious answer is that it did not: man, and the rest of creation, was initially good, but through the abuse of freedom, man made himself an abominable, wicked creature he is now.\n\"The world is a dance in which good, descending from God, is disturbed by evil arising from the creatures, and the resulting conflict is resolved by God's own assumption of the suffering nature which evil produces. The doctrine of the Fall asserts that the evil which thus makes the fuel or raw material of the second and more complex kind of good is not God's contribution but man's\".\nPain, through trials and sacrifices, teaches us to rely on God, to act out of spiritual strength, to act for purely heavenly purpose and to accept our discipleship.\n\"Human will becomes truly creative and truly our own when it is wholly God's, and this is one of the many senses in which he that loses his soul shall find it.\"\nIf distressful feelings disguise itself as thought, all nonsense is possible- faith in God is challenged, we object to His goodness, and worse, we doubt His existence. All of those seemed valid to a suffering soul, due to the sway of unbearable pain.\n\"We are not merely imperfect creatures that need improvement: we are rebels that need lay down their arms\".\nIn conclusion then, pain is not a mere influence to make a creature's submission to the will of God easier. Remembering Prophet Isaiah\u2019s words in the Bible, chapters 46-53, God has called him prior to his birth. He was molded and polished through physical pain, trials and humiliation to be equipped for God\u2019s divine purpose.When I first considered reading this book, I asked myself if I am lucid enough to absorb Lewis\u2019 arguments. I ended up quoting him and taking notes more than I usually do. But then, I realized that I am merely to review, not write an abridge version. The Problem of Pain is a difficult read; it is not for the casual reader and you should expect to be intellectually challenged. But the big difficulty is much smaller compared to the bigger lessons within."}, {"userName": "Traveller", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3145526-traveller", "userReview": "< -<-<- < -<-<- This or.... This or...this->->-->->- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPoRn...Personally, I lean more towards the latter camp. Lewis does at least make a good, solid, and sophisticated effort to address the problem of: \"Why does God allow so much pain and suffering, if He is really a loving God, and if He really does exist?\"; - which is why Lewis gets 3 stars, even if I don't completely agree.I remember quite liking his argument at the time I read it, which was quite some time ago. He seemed to be saying that pain is sent to test a person, to make you stronger, to help you grow spiritually so that you could become a more spiritually evolved and aware person.But, I have in the meantime started wondering: on the other hand, what kind of cruel deity would devise such a system, that includes such horrible suffering as the world has seen? Even if it is to make them 'stronger', or cause them to grow spiritually.Lewis's argument, IMO, would hold water better if you reckoned re-incarnation into the system. Then it would make more sense to throw obstacles into the path of a soul in it's evolutionary journey towards Nirvana...but in the Christian world, where the most common doctrine I have heard, is that all you need to do is to proclaim Jesus as your savior to win an automatic seat in heaven, no need for you to grow spiritually, it doesn't seem to fit in quite 100%. I must admit that I do like the idea of spiritual growth, such as presented in this book, and in The Pilgrim's Progress, for instance.Unfortunately, now that I am older, wiser, and seen more suffering in both myself and others, I'm not quite as inured to Lewis's arguments, and not quite so eager to welcome pain and suffering.PS. After reading a bit of Thomas Aquinas, I realized that Lewis borrows a LOT from him."}, {"userName": "RC", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63114-rc", "userReview": "It says something that after so many years C. S. Lewis is still one of the foremost Christian apologists of our time. The Problem of Pain is a difficult question every religion has to deal with, and one which has been especially difficult for Christianity. Some religions have the luxury of explaining pain as something deserved - a result of bad behavior from a previous life, or perhaps pain and suffering are caused by a malevolent deity in opposition to a good and loving God. Christianity has no such option. \u201cIf God were good, he would wish to make His creatures perfectly happy, and if God were almighty He would be able to do what He wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\u201d Lewis presents a very readable and widely accessible solution to this problem, covering the origins of human suffering, incurred in the fall, what divine omnipotence and goodness really mean, and why they allow for the existence of pain in creation, heaven and hell, and a topic not often treated but important - the existence of pain in animals who are in every sense innocent. Particularly useful is Lewis' distinction between kindness and love. Lewis reminds us that real love, a love that looks out for the best interests of the beloved, sometimes requires the inflicting of painful experience. From the perspective of the one undergoing the experience, this may not seem like love, but any parent, teacher, or anyone tasked with the guidance of the young will understand that this sort of \u201ctough love\u201d is often necessary if one does not want a spoiled child to grow into a spoiled adult."}, {"userName": "Toe", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe", "userReview": "Apology for the existence of pain and suffering.

When we fall in love with a woman, do we cease to care whether she is clean or dirty, fair or foul? Do we not rather then first begin to care? Does any woman regard it as a sign of love in a man that he neither knows nor cares how she is looking? Love may, indeed, love the beloved when her beauty is lost: but not because it is lost. Love may forgive all infirmities and love still in spite of them: but Love cannot cease to will their removal. Love is more sensitive than hatred itself to every blemish in the beloved...\" - C.S.

Unless one is morbidly naive, or has yet to encounter the counterarguments to Christianity in particular and theism in general, I honestly cannot see where his appeal lies.How CS Lewis should have died.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9EQS-...The Problem of Evil is an insurmountable one for Christians (and all other theists who believe in a perfectly loving, all-powerful and all-knowing god). There have been intense and motivated efforts over the past two millennia to defend such a position rationally, and they have all failed. Miserably. Utterly. And in many cases, dishonestly.Some approached involve invoking an unknown \"greater good\" defense (which throws god's omnipotence under the bus. An omnipotent deity could simply actualise a desired goal without needing to use suffering as a \"middle man\"). Attempts to shift the problem by asserting that human happiness is not the goal of life (but knowing god is) removes the omnibenevolence and omnipotence of god (if you love someone, you don't want them to suffer. It really is that simple). On page 104, Lewis concedes that not everyone suffers equally. He does not give a reason for this, and indeed, admits that our puny human minds cannot understand why god would allow some to live decades in comfort and luxury while others suffer for months or years on end. To quote Lewis himself: \"The causes of this distribution I do not know; but from our present point of view it ought to be clear that the real problem is not why some humble, pious, believing people suffer, but why some do NOT (emphasis Lewis', in italics). Our Lord Himself, it will be remembered, explained the salvation of those who are fortunate in this world only by referring to the unsearchable omnipotence of God.\"That's not an explanation. Lewis is falling back on the ancient and ubiquitous appeal to ignorance. God's mysterious ways are beyond us. Well, by that \"logic,\" he could send all Christians to hell and everyone else to heaven, and Lewis, by his own admission, would just have to suck up an eternity of torture.The old canard of free will is often invoked. Unfortunately, free will is meaningless unless everyone has an equal amount of it. This is undeniably NOT the case. Not everyone is given the same lifespan, physical strength, mental acuity, political clout, financial resources, and so on. Lewis is pontificating from the luxurious confines of his residence, funded by conveniently gullible sheep. This has certainly damaged his ability to empathise with the billions who live on less than a dollar each day. And the thousands who starve to death every time the Earth completes a full rotation.Lewis also, perhaps unwittingly, advocates a social Darwinism in which the rich and physically powerful are able to murder, rape and steal from weaker individuals (and are therefore less able to exercise their own free will to prevent their own suffering). Lewis worships a cosmic pedophile who revels in granting freedom to abhorrent individuals while getting his jollies from seeing the most vulnerable suffer and die in agony (only to get thrown into even more torture in the Christian vision of hell).Lastly, a loving god would take away free will from those who would willingly surrender it in return for a life without suffering. Funnily enough, Lewis seems to believe in a heaven without suffering but with all the bells and whistles of freedom. So why not create that universe from the get-go and stick with it? Why create a universe with even the possibility of corruption? It certainly is not something a perfect god would do. Then again, a perfect god would not blackmail beings he supposedly loves for eternal worship.While Lewis is usually a good writer, capable of spinning yarns to attract the attention of children and young teenagers, he also assumes that there is a deep, overriding purpose behind suffering. This purpose is so important that it is more critical to his god to NOT end suffering now, but to let things run their \"natural\" course until his plan is complete. In service of this goal, he creates a short story that is akin to an essay on theistic evolution, and how man is ultimately responsible for the Fall and his own corruption. If god knows everything, including the future, then he orchestrated the fall (and everything else) before setting his plan into motion. Arguing that god exists outside of time is a lazy copout, nothing more.As a 'loudspeaker' for the Christian god, pain has done more to drive people away from him than anything else. An all-knowing, all-powerful and all-good god would not allow any suffering, even in the service of a so-called \"greater good.\" And if such a god desires suffering for a greater good, then it would follow logically that his followers should cause suffering to convert more people. After all, that is god's best tool for getting our attention, is it not? Fortunately, CS Lewis and most Christians today do not follow this logic to its end point. Those who do open hospitals and hospices and waste money on bibles rather than food (explaining why only 25% of tithes go to benefit indigent people around the world). CS Lewis realised this, which is why he asserted, in chapter 7, that while evil acts can lead to \"greater\" goods such as pity and compassion, the individual who commits evil is not justified simply because positive benefits will flow.The hypocrisy here is glaringly apparent when Lewis moves on to depict his god as using good men as \"sons\" and evil men as \"tools\" to achieve his goals. Such an obvious double standard is patently hypocritical and serves to do little except expose Lewis' advocacy of divine fiat for what it is - blind obedience (which is the antithesis of sound moral reasoning).His childishly puerile attempts to justify hell are perhaps the only thing worse. According to Lewis' theology, pain is used by god as a teacher, a \"flag of truth in a rebel fortress\" (p. 122). This obviously misses the point - an omnipotent god would not need to use pain. If a tri-omni deity knows good from evil without needing to suffer, why couldn't he have simply created humans who were likewise omniscient? This is yet another obvious point that is glossed over by a highly overrated apologist."}, {"userName": "Kjersti", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3994223-kjersti", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this book.

Thus, there were some parts I read through without the attention I probably should have devoted to it. I don't usually like writing reviews where the fault is with me; but alas, here I am.As for content, CS Lewis has, as always, very well thought-out arguments and a logical approach to his content. There were a couple minor instances where I disagreed with ever-so-slightly, but I had no concerns even close to major. If you want to compare this to his other works, I find it's slightly weaker than his later books.. But that does in no way mean this is poor craftmanship. Surely, to improve with time is a positive thing, and you cannot hold that against him.

How I got to C.S. Lewis, however, is a long story that I'll reserve for another post/review.Anyway, I loved the The Problem of Pain when I first read it. I couldn't put it down. When I started clearing my bookshelves last year in attempt to de-clutter, I came across my old and dusty copy of the book again and started to re-read. What I love about The Problem of Pain - actually, all of Lewis' books I've read - is his use of language and his use of similes, which make it easy to follow his argument.In The Problem of Pain, Lewis elaborates on the meaning of divine goodness, human pain, animal pain, heaven, hell - not necessarily in this order, though - and tries to explain from his Christian point of view what divine love is, what pain is, why humans can feel pain, and that there is a divine purpose to suffering.When I first read this almost twenty years ago, I could accept the possibility that there may be a substance to the arguments he puts forward. Having re-read this now, I still admire Lewis' use of language and the elegance of his argument but I find it very difficult to be persuaded by it. Now, the argument that there is a purpose to suffering that allows the individual to grow or improve spiritually seems little more than wishful thinking.Of course, my take on this may sound rather pessimistic. However, where Lewis draws from Thomas Aquinas and other sources of formal religious Christian teaching, I feel much more aligned with other schools of thought that would choose kindness towards living beings over the particular form of patriarchal tyranny of divine love that Lewis describes.(Sidenote: Btw Jack, how dare you say that the newt has no self! For all we know, he might.Seriously, I'm not impressed by an argument that starts with the notion that we cannot know what God's intentions are or indeed know anything that is outside of the human experience, and which then categorically denies that non-human living beings have a notion of the \"self\". )"}, {"userName": "Amelia, the pragmatic idealist", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1852293-amelia-the-pragmatic-idealist", "userReview": "*Just* as good as Mere Christianity, but not quite as easy to understand. I would say that this book is probably more relevant in our culture now than when it was first published. I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone, because it seeks to give answers to questions that everybody asks at some point. The idea behind this book is \"why do we have pain in our life?\" or more specifically, \"If God is supposed to be good, and powerful, and \"in charge,\" why does He allow suffering?\" If you're just a little like me, you may find it easy to rattle off questions and then...not exactly look for an answer. There's a kind of self-preserving security about being able to ask questions that you may or may not actually want answered. But I took a CS Lewis class in college (yes, there is such a thing! And even cooler - one of our sister schools has a class on Tolkien!), and this was required reading. Lewis had a gift of taking abstract and complex subjects and making them understandable. Granted, you may have to read his sentences a few times before you get what he's saying, but the idea itself is easy to understand.We had to give chapter presentations on this one, and of course, I had to do the \"Hell\" chapter. So if you read this book and get to the Hell chapter, you can think of me :P The thing that I love about Lewis is that he always backs up his points. It's never this, \"Oh, well I have all the answers and here they are!\" You may not agree with his interpretation (and some of the times in this book, I didn't really see things the same way he does) but I understand where he's coming from.

This book was a really interesting and poignant analysis of pain and the Christian response to it. I read it alongside A Grief Observed because I wanted to know if Lewis's \"intellectual\" answers stood alongside his \"emotional\" ones. (That is one of the greatest oversimplifications of either book I could possibly make but that is how I started out.) I quickly realized the two are almost incomparable. They aren't intended to be comparable. While A Grief Observed was a heart-wrenching and yet inspiring read, The Problem of Pain was almost more so. His description of heaven and hell really impacted my understanding on a subject I thought I was pretty comfortable in. It isn't a 5 star book. I disagree with some of his conclusions and theology. It wasn't a book that necessarily \"blew my mind\", yet at the same time it challenged and restructured a lot of my thoughts. One of my favorite thoughts in the book is this from page 116: \"The Christian doctrine of suffering explains, I believe, a very curious fact about the world we live in. The settled happiness and security which we all desire, God withholds from us by the very nature of the world: but joy, pleasure, and merriment, He has scattered broadcast. We are never safe, but we have plenty of fun, and some ecstasy. It is not hard to see why. The security we crave would teach us to rest our hearts in this world and oppose an obstacle to our return to God: a few moments of happy love, a landscape, a symphony, a merry meeting with our friends, a bathe or a football match, have no such tendency. Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns, but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.\""}, {"userName": "Elevetha ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11828657-elevetha", "userReview": "4.5 stars.

And then I came upon the chapter \"Heaven\" and, nearly immediately, I knew that it would be my favorite chapter.

But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\"As a Christian, I've often wondered about this issue, especially when friends are diagnosed with cancer or the country suffers terrorist attacks. It's a difficult question, and although I accept the explanation through faith, grasping it rationally is another matter. Lewis does a good job dealing with the matter from both perspectives. However, I doubt many non-Judeo-Christians would be persuaded by this book. Lewis wouldn't be entirely at fault for that.The main place where I disagree with Lewis is on the Creation and Fall of man. He rejects a literal interpretation of Genesis, including a 6-day creation, Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, forbidden fruit, and temptation by Satan. Instead, Lewis believes that humans evolved from apes or more primitive life forms, and that the Genesis account is a myth. I was surprised by this, because he references creation accounts and Adam and Eve in other works like The Chronicles of Narnia and Perelandra, from his Space Trilogy. Perhaps he considers them all equally fictional stories.The other reason I find Lewis' rejection of a literal interpretation of Genesis surprising is that it causes many inconsistencies in the Bible. Both the Old and New Testaments contain references to the 6-day creation and the Fall, and how the Fall affected not only humanity, but the rest of the planet as well. Jesus Himself talks about such issues. Lewis accepts the modern scientific view that pain and suffering existed on Earth for millennia before humans appeared. So much for \"God saw that it was good\".Despite such disagreements, I thought Lewis presented a thought-provoking case for why God allows pain to exist. My favorite reason presented is that pain distracts us from our comfortable lives where we're all too eager to forget about faith and God, and forces us to become closer to Him and other Christians.NotesWhen we say God is omnipotent (all-powerful), we mean He can do anything that's intrinsically possible. It's nonsense to claim He can do what's intrinsically impossible or self-contradictory.The possibility of suffering is required by nature and free wills. To exclude it is to exclude life itself.We were not made primarily to love God, but for God to love us. 1 John 4:10.Because God has and is all, He only loves us and is grieved by us because He chooses to.We sin not because of ignorance or inability, but because we aren't truly intending to avoid it.Lewis rejects Total Depravity because, logically, we wouldn't know our depravity if we were totally depraved, and because he sees so much goodness in human nature.The question, \"Was it better for God to create than to not create?\" is meaningless, because the reality that allows us to even pose the question requires that God did create. If the question did have any meaning, the answer must be yes, simply because God did create.Lewis believes that humans descended from animals, and that God granted them consciousness once they were sufficiently advanced. The Fall was an act of self-will or self-interest (and thus, rebellion against God) exhibited by these early humans.The Fall didn't surprise God. \"God saw the crucifixion in the act of creating the first nebula.\"Lewis' theory for the origin of disease and death: Before the Fall, God ruled the human organism through the human spirit.When man rejected God, the human spirit lost control of the human organism, and biochemical and environmental forces brought pain, senility, and death.Lewis rejects the notion that we inherit Original Sin or moral responsibility from Adam (or some other remote ancestor). He says we're members of a \"spoiled species\" by our own will and actions.If the omniscient (all-knowing) God knew that Abraham would obey him, why the needless torture of testing his willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac? Because even what God foresees/predestines hasn't actually occurred until the human performs it.God uses tribulation to take our attention off our lives and toys, and forces us to focus on Him. Thus, tribulation must continue until we are remade (or our remaking is hopeless, in the case the unsaved).Because tribulation is necessary for redemption, no economic or political reform can bring about heaven on earth. However, we must still attempt to remove the evils of this world simply do to a strong sense of common miseries.\"You will certainly carry out God's purpose, however you act, but it makes a difference to you whether you serve like Judas or like John\".People go to Hell because they chose to. They exercise their free will to reject God. \"The doors of hell are locked on the inside\". You can't expect God to do more to help humans avoid Hell than he already has by dying on the cross at Calvary.Lewis believes that non-human (plant, animal, etc.) life was corrupted by Satan or some other non-human entity before humans existed. Carnivorousness and animal \"suffering\" existed prior to humans.Animals and plants can't truly suffer because they aren't sentient.God created individuals so he could love each differently, and that each could love and worship Him differently.Heaven isn't a bribe. \"There are rewards that do not sully motives. It is safe to tell the pure in heart that they shall see God, for only the pure in heart want to.\""}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4740264-chris", "userReview": "This was my 50th read of the year, and it should have been my first. Well, I also read Mere Christianity this year, so perhaps this should have been my second. At any rate, wow. I was reading someone else's reviews (of a different book -- I don't remember which) where they stated that they only give 5 stars to \"life changing\" books. That is indeed what I am doing in this case, or at least, what I hope I am doing since only time will tell if my life has really been changed.My wife has a chronic illness with which, much of the time, the pain and fatigue is so intense and persistent that it keeps her bedridden. Seeing her in all that pain and being utterly helpless to do anything substantial for her is superlatively difficult. I think, \"God, why are you allowing this to happen to her?\" Then, while I'm trying to fill in for what she is unable to do on her own, I (selfishly, and with plenty of guilt afterwards) get overwhelmed and frustrated and find myself thinking, \"God, why are you allowing this to happen to ME?! What did I do wrong or what am I not doing right? What good can possibly come of this whole situation? What good is it that I try to be an obedient Christian if I'm still left with this misery?\"Of course, there are the quieter moments, when at least part of the house is clean, we don't desperately need to make a trip to the grocery store, all 4 kids aren't screaming and I start to feel some peace. In these moments I think, \"Ok, God. I think I might see at least one angle here. Maybe you're trying to show me that I can make it through this in one piece because something even bigger that I would have previously thought impossible or at least insurmountable is coming up in my life. Maybe you're showing me that I too can be content in all things. Maybe that's the point here, at least for me.\" This thinking is (at least) incomplete and (at best) partly wrong (knowing me, it's probably wrong on multiple levels, but it's only part of my story so let's keep moving).Reading The Problem of Pain helped me to put together a bunch of pieces that I had previously learned and combine them with some new things hadn't quite sunk in before, and made me realize that I was focused on the wrong thing: me. Certainly there's the fallacy of self-sufficiency to consider: \"The creature\u2019s illusion of self-sufficiency must, for the creature\u2019s sake, be shattered; and by trouble or fear of trouble on earth, by crude fear of the eternal flames, God shatters it \u2018unmindful of His glory\u2019s diminution\u2019.\" (pg.95) But more than that, I was focused on what all this means for me, when the fact that there is pain and the fact that I am not perfectly comfortable in life does not have to be about a lack of faith on my part or a lack of provision by God -- it's actually part of an unimaginably intricate and complex process by which my wife, me, my kids and all those encounter us are also being changed in some positive ways. God may not have \"brought this on us\", but he is certainly using everything to further his Will, even our situation. Besides, if we were all comfortable here, how would we feel any desire for heaven?\"The settled happiness and security which we all desire, God withholds from us by the very nature of the world: but joy, pleasure, and merriment, He has scattered broadcast. We are never safe, but we have plenty of fun, and some ecstasy. It is not hard to see why. The security we crave would teach us to rest our hearts in this world and oppose an obstacle to our return to God: a few moments of happy love, a landscape, a symphony, a merry meeting with our friends, a bathe or a football match, have no such tendency. Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns, but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.\" (pg. 116)Reading this book helped me get to the point where now I really do believe that my job is simple: realize that I'm just a human that is reliant on Him, ask Him for help with all of it (little and big), and remember that this life isn't the end -- as a forgetful person I need constant reminders that there is something unimaginably better waiting for me and my family. The tougher moments are my reminders, and now I will try to think more about the purpose of the reminder and what is on the other side."}, {"userName": "Victoria Mars", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3999864-victoria-mars", "userReview": "1- Pens\u00e9 que nunca iba terminar este libro.2- Me cost\u00f3 introducirme totalmente en la lectura.

Me pongo a pensar ahora en todos esos ni\u00f1os al cuidado del Sename. Ni\u00f1os abusados, maltratados, sin amor ni educaci\u00f3n. Ni\u00f1os abandonados que son arrojados en una misma sala con delincuentes menores de edad. Ese dolor nos deber\u00eda desesperar. Ese dolor deber\u00eda hacer que el gobierno sin apellido pol\u00edtico actuara sin descanso para asegurar la integridad f\u00edsica y mental de tantos desprotegidos. Miles de ni\u00f1os en este pa\u00eds y en todo el mundo son arrojados a la jaula de los \"leones\" todos los d\u00edas. Millones de personas en el mundo son devorados por \"leones\" d\u00eda tras d\u00eda, pero pocos son capaces de hacer algo para salvarlos de las mand\u00edbulas de una sociedad individualista y cruel. Del dolor pueden surgir muchas cosas pavorosas, como arrojarse a las fauces de un le\u00f3n, pero tambi\u00e9n puede florecer lo mejor de una persona si es que cuenta con la compresi\u00f3n de su entorno o al menos con la empat\u00eda del resto.

So much of what he said about the way the Lord uses difficulties in the lives of men to produce good in and for them, and about how dying to self is the only path to genuine life, was so true, and so well and beautifully expressed -- but I have huge, huge problems with the way he handled the creation story and the fall. It's actually a great (although sad and disappointing) example of how denying the literal meaning of the Genesis story introduces wild inconsistencies into Christian thought, and necessitates turning to absurd speculations to fill the gaps. His view of man's corruption is also sketchy; he even says in one place that he denies Total Depravity (from his explanation, I think that stems more from a misunderstanding of what the term means than anything else, but at best, I still disagree with him). His view of free will is definitely incorrect and some of his statements regarding that, unless I misunderstood him completely, were outright falsehood.Really a 2.5 rating... giving it a 3 because, again, there were bits that were incredibly good.\"Man is not the centre. God does not exist for the sake of man. Man does not exist for his own sake. 'Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure the are and were created.' We were not made primarily that we may love God (though we were made for that too) but that God may love us, that we may become objects in which the Divine love may rest 'well pleased.' To ask that God's love should be content with us is to ask that God should cease to be God: because He is what He is, His love must, in the nature of things, be impeded and repelled by certain stains in our present character, and because He already loves us He must labour to make us lovable.\""}, {"userName": "Grace Crandall", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48985935-grace-crandall", "userReview": "There's something incredibly comforting about C.S. Lewis's writing style. He explains things well and clearly, but on the points he's unsure about he's honest. (Actually he's always honest, blazingly so, in a way that's doubly endearing and challenging, but perhaps that's beside the point). Though it's technically a point-by-point defense of Christianity against the 'pain and suffering in the world proves the absence of a good god' argument, The Problem of Pain never seems like just a bit of apologetics. It's logical, but not without emotional weight, and even while attempting to prove the necessity of pain Lewis retains a great deal of sensitivity and compassion. The book is a conversation more than an argument, and a pretty jovial conversation at that. The clarity of each individual point, and the fluid way all the points came together into conclusion after conclusion, was staggering. Theology is a heady, mystifying subject at the best of times, and I'm eternally in love with how Lewis can somehow admit the mystery while making graspable what parts of it really are open to view. It was also balanced, incredibly so; justice was talked about and mercy never forgotten, free will was put forth as the necessity it is while the ultimate sovereignty of God constantly reinforced. There's a kind of high-flying joy and grounded solemness sandwiching the narrative, and the points where the joy and wonder of it all were brought into focus took my breath away. This is a beautiful, excellent book and I'm definitely going to be reading it more than once :)"}, {"userName": "Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22315959-morgan", "userReview": "I don't agree with everything, but still, there's a lot of good to be learned from it.

The issue is so deep and all-consuming for humanity and Lewis' approach so detailed that I cannot possibly take it in all at once. He unabashedly asks tough questions and explains logically his positions so that one cannot argue with his thoughts because they certainly make sense, even if one does not agree with all his theology. Yet he is wise enough not to venture answers to questions that either have no answers, answers he personally did not understand, or are beyond human understanding altogether.

Also, this review is written from an orthodox Christian standpoint--I'm not qualified to offer any other.)\"If God is good, why does he cause or allow us to experience painful circumstances? Perhaps he is not good. Or, perhaps he just isn't powerful enough to protect his creatures from pain.\" These are the difficult questions, natural to many of us, that C.S. Lewis attempts to address in this book. It is one of his earliest works as a Christian, predating Mere Christianity by three years. Because of this, and because he takes a mostly-apologetic stance rather than simply addressing what the Bible has to say about pain, a significant number of his ideas reflect his secular academic background imposing itself upon the supernatural. But I will start with the positives first:The chapter entitled \"Divine Goodness\" is truly excellent. It addresses the idea that God's goodness and the fact that He perfects his children through trials go hand-in-hand. It brings into perspective our cultural tendency to assume that God must be a \"senile grandfather-type\" who just wants everyone to have a good time. His arguments are intellectually and scripturally sound, and I believe this chapter can stand alone for many believers struggling with trials of various sorts. Secondly, I appreciated the times when Lewis qualified his views as \"simply opinion,\" \"a layman's ignorant perspective,\" \"subject to correction by real theologians,\" etc. This is a message he sent often in Mere Christianity as well, and it shows a measure of humility that (from what I learned in Surprised by Joy) did not come naturally to him. On the other hand, in this early book, the places where Lewis so qualifies his opinions are rather few, and he presents some things as fact which most Christian theologians and a respectable number of scientists deny. Most prevalently, his belief in the Theory of Evolution permeates two chapters of this book--\"The Fall of Man,\" and \"Animal Pain.\" In the first, Lewis treats the Biblical account of Adam and Eve as a doctrine rather than a narrative, and posits that somewhere in the evolution of the species, mankind (in whatever number) were given souls and became \"Paradisal Man.\" At some point, by some means, Paradisal Men fell. The tragic result of Lewis' false assumption is that he consequently has no understanding of the Scriptural concept of a federal head--\"as 'in' Adam all died, so 'in' Christ we can be made alive together with Him.\" If Adam is just the mythical name for \"Paradisal Man,\" that \"in\" really doesn't make any sense, and the word \"in\" is admittedly mysterious to Lewis. The second chapter (on \"Animal Pain\") argues that the animal species cannot have experienced its first pangs at the fall of man, since the evolutionary record shows us that carnivorous behavior in animals predates humanity. He posits that perhaps Satan, who seems to have fallen before the creation of mankind, might have corrupted creation first, and mankind second. Again, this completely ignores the narrative of biblical creation, which bears no trademarks of a parable or myth as far as Scripture goes. I realize it was not Lewis' intention to be cavalier about Scripture, and indeed many of us in modern Christendom have at one time or another been deceived by compromising doctrines that claim to be intellectually superior to orthodox Christianity. However, Lewis' belief in Evolution was not the only area this type of deception occurred. He also posited that, because Christ lived in a human body, with a human brain of an average size, He may well have spoken historical or scientific error without impugning his Deity. In this context, Lewis mentions that we might take as truth Jesus' teachings about the Devil because they don't contradict any verified scientific findings, only our cultural beliefs. Truly, it is a great mystery that Jesus \"grew in wisdom\" as well as in stature, and we know He was not always or perhaps ever omniscient in the body before being glorified at His resurrection, but we also know that He possessed knowledge well outside the reaches of the human intellect (many places in Scripture tell us that he knew people's thoughts), and I cannot easily count the number of references to the Christ as \"perfect.\" Add to that the fact that Scripture declares itself to be perfect (2 Timothy 3:16), and it becomes clear that the idea of Jesus' having spoken error at all, and that error then being recorded forever to misdirect us in the infallible Word of God, is quite contrary to the precepts of our Faith.These compromises with the secular climate in which Lewis lived were disheartening, and at times as I read I actually felt sick to my stomach. The chapters that were neither excellent nor nauseating seemed at times beneficial and at times self-indulgent. I don't believe I would have felt so strongly if I didn't so respect the man God made Lewis as he continued his Christian life. I'm so thankful that his reliance on Scripture certainly grew as he matured in his walk, and his likeness to the world around him lessened. I reassert the value of the chapter entitled \"Divine Goodness,\" but urge extreme caution and a discerning eye when reading the rest."}, {"userName": "Issabella", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50341326-issabella", "userReview": "This book is one of C.S.
