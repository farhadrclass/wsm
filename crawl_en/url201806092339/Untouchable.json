Untouchable kind of reminds of Aleatha Romig books, like Insidious and K.A. Tucker\u2019s Burying Water series, in the sense Untouchable is not full of romance, but more suspenseful and a little taboo. Stella is an escort. She is good at her job and she doesn\u2019t have any intentions of giving up the profession. What I found so fascinating about this read was that this book touched the not so glamorous side of prostitution. Not every client is an attractive billionaire and this really got me interested.The beginning starts with a mini prologue, if you are like me and you don\u2019t like to read any foreshadowing, I suggest you skip this part. It won\u2019t take away anything from the story. I was instantly hit in the face with story from chapter one.I wouldn\u2019t say Untouchable is graphic, but there\u2019s detail where you get the full picture. It\u2019s a very descriptive book. For example, Stella also works at parties with other escorts and there is a scene with multiple partners and drugs. It was really really really fascinating to read. The guys were kind of rough and the girls went into it as a \u201cjob\u201d.A girl is murdered and Stella is all of sudden in the middle of it. She doesn\u2019t understand why her friend is killed and Stella can\u2019t help, but pursue the mystery. Throughout the book Stella takes on clients and starts different kind of relationships with them. Like I said, the book isn\u2019t overly romantic, but there is a tiny part of it and that kept me in the story. What I really enjoyed was how different this book was. I liked how it was a little dark, taboo and suspenseful. With every client Stella meets, I was always wondering how this guy would be different and how he would interact with Stella.If you are into darkish reads with suspenseful plot, then this one is for you.

Right away you realize that Stella is trying to forget her previous life, one where she had a \u201crespectable\u201d life and job, and getting down to the bottom of what happened is just one of the mysteries. It was fascinating being the \u201cthe fly on the wall\u201d as Stella takes on clients and gets through this type of life; the way she stayed detached and approached her job almost in a clinical manner. Still, there is a client or two that get under her skin, and I had romantic hopes for one of them. Things become dangerous and a lot more interesting after one of her professional girlfriends is murdered. Stella is shaken and jolted awake by the murder, and she\u2019s no longer able to drift along in numb avoidance of her past. Stella really did get herself into the middle of a frightening situation, and I wondering how she\u2019d find a way out, but I was pleased with her clever thinking. I found Stella to be a sympathetic character, but I did want to shake her a few times when it was clear her lifestyle was part escape/part penance over her past, especially when her choices hurt the people that cared for her. \u201cYou convict yourself without a trial. Now you\u2019re living out the life sentence you gave yourself.\u201dIt seems most of us are our harshest critic or judge, but at some point it\u2019s time to move on and realize there\u2019s nothing you can do about the past. While I wasn\u2019t happy her friend was murdered, I\u2019m glad Stella didn\u2019t just go about her life like normal after. Untouchable was a different sort of read for me. Yes, I\u2019ve read countless mysteries/thrillers, but never one with a call girl at its center. To be honest, I was a little hesitant to pick up the story for that very reason. The thought of reading about a working girl didn\u2019t appeal to me, but the story was captivating and not off-putting like I thought it might be. I will say some scenes were graphic and gritty, fair warning. Even though it wasn\u2019t the central focus of the story, there is a romance. Ben was delicious and their time together was very sensual. Their chemistry was palpable, heated, and it felt like something that had long term potential. You know when a couple just clicks? I felt that with Ben and Stella, so I of course was hoping for a happy ending with them. \u201cJesus, Stella. I\u2019ve been thinking about you\u2026about this, for weeks. It got so I thought I must be imagining how good it was.\u201dAva Marsh\u2019s debut was engrossing, suspenseful, and beautifully written! I thought the setting of London with its moody weather was perfect and atmospheric for this thriller. I\u2019ll definitely be on the watch whatever Ms. Marsh writes next.

Imagine if Belle du Jour and Martina Cole teamed up to write a thriller together the result would be Untouchable, a dark and sexy thriller with flawed but likable heroine. The book Untouchable is fast-paced, compelling and deserves to be a huge hit. With out question Untouchable is a gritty commercial thriller with an addictive blend of sex. The story is based on considerable research into the oft ignored world of high-class escorting. Untouchable offers authentic and insight into a dangerous world intriguing world we are not often privy to. It challenges traditional cliches of the thriller genre, and highlights controversy surrounding feminism and the sex industry. Attraction can be fatal when a call girl is murdered.

I wouldn't say it was a disappointment per se, but it didn't really live up to what I expected when I read the blurb either. It was one of those middle ground books for me.I was expecting something more exciting, more intriguing, more twisted, more... well, thrilling, but it turned out an underwhelming read.:( While the idea was interesting and very original, the story itself didn't quite hold me invested. I kept zoning out; sometimes it really dragged and felt like it was going nowhere. To be brutally honest here, it felt quite dull. Part of my brain was anticipating getting all the answers and seeing where all those 'twists' could go, if the heroine will find redemption and end up with one of those men, but other part of my brain was, simply put, bored. Does that make any sense? It was frustrating because I really wanted to like it, I loved the idea of it, but not so much the little facts or the execution. I needed more to really pull me in... The heroine and her story were definitely unique (how often do we read a book from an escort's POV? A working one at that, who was dealing with her fair share of drama and weird clients too, beside the little mystery crime thing she dragged herself in). But...I didn't really feel it. All the sex scenes felt so clinical (probably because of her profession?), even with the 'love interest', and the plot twists were unimpressive and the end anticlimactic... Where's the emotion, the passion, the feeling, the depth, the anticipation that should come with this type of books?I didn't really want to straight up DNF it, but I wasn't all that into it either. Just meh. It had its ups and downs, but overall, it wasn't very impressive for me.

Stella is paid for sex and seems to rather enjoy the way she makes a living. We see her entertaining men and working prosaically on her tax return. Stella finds her life turned upside down, when her friend and fellow prostitute Amanda is murdered. Who would want to kill her and is Stella also in danger?The first part of this novel felt like \u2018The Secret Diary of a Call Girl\u2019. Stella shows us her life, in all of its explicit glory. Steamy encounters and a rather explicit sex party scene are thrown in for good measure. If you\u2019ve read \u2018Fifty Shades\u2019 or anything similar, you won\u2019t find yourself blushing too much. Stella seems to have chosen this way of life, keeping men at a distance. The male clients were entertaining and some of their excuses for using the services of Stella made me chuckle. There is more to Stella than just sex, as soon becomes apparent after the death of her friend. Stella comes into her own and starts to fight for the truth. I really found myself warming increasingly to Stella and her gutsy ways. She proved to be a hero.This is definitely one for those who don\u2019t mind explicit sex in their crime reads. It does work though, and I found myself drawn into Stella\u2019s life from the word go. There is a lovely mix of intrigue, revenge, murder and blackmail.

When another girl is found murdered Stella becomes embroiled in the mystery of her death and as she moves ever closer to the truth, things are about to get very dangerous.What I loved most about this is the beautiful mash up of mystery, thriller and real life drama and the sheer depth of character Ava Marsh brings to the people you will meet within the pages. It is dark for sure, unrelenting in its descriptive prose, with an authentic look at life for a call girl, touching on realistic issues and yet also managing to tell a stonking good story at the same time.Multi-layered, it is endlessly fascinating as we peel away the surface to what lies beneath especially with relation to the motivations and personality traits of the characters. Grace is such an alluring and provocative character to follow as she tells her story and you begin to understand her more.If you are not a fan of graphic sexual content this one will definitely NOT be for you. The author has not pulled any punches when it comes to the realism of the world she is showing you, whilst it is never gratuitous and always speaks to the story, it IS gritty and honestly described which some may find disturbing. For me it was extremely necessary to the plot and indeed gave the whole tale a definitive and credible edge which would have been lost should the author have tried to mollycoddle. Overall a really really terrific debut - almost impossible to put down once you start I sincerely hope that we will meet Grace again. She has, I think, a lot more to say.Highly RecommendedHappy Reading Folks!"}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4155740-claire", "userReview": "Review: Untouchable by Ava Marsh \u00a0Published by:\u00a0Random House UK, Transworld (13th August 2015)\u00a0ISBN:\u00a0978-0552171205\u00a0Source:\u00a0NetGalley\u00a0Rating:\u00a04.5*\u00a0Synopsis:\u2018If you start feeling anything for a client \u2013 and it does happen \u2013 count the money.

Certainly once I got into it I didn't want to put it down. This is a story about Stella, a lady with a profession that some might not like, who has been running from her past for some time and lands herself in trouble in her present. To say more would be to give spoilers away but what I will say is that due to the nature of what Stella does there are a lot of sex scenes within the book. I, for one, found them tastefully done and very much intrinsic to the storytelling (the party scene, say no more!!), but it may not be to everyone's taste, so if it's really not your thing, perhaps this one isn't for you.The story itself is told well, it's pacy, well characterised and really draws you in as a reader. There were times when I questioned plausibility but these were minor quibbles because the character of Stella is really engaging and it's very much her story told from her point of view.If you're looking for a pacy read with, um, a fair bit of the racy stuff but is equally thrilling as a story, then look no further!!

I purchased Untouchable a while ago when everyone was raving about how good it was. A short while after I had started reading, I had made a 30% dent in my Kindle and it felt like I'd been reading for no time at all. It would have been rude to stop reading and so I carried on, and finished the book in one sitting. Untouchable is an addictive read that had me glued to my Kindle. It's also a book very different to anything I've read before, and that's probably one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much.It's hard to know where to start with a book like this, but I guess with our main character, Stella. Stella is a prostitute, albeit one that doesn't have to parade her wares on a freezing cold street corner. Instead she commands \u00a3250 an hour. Seemingly lucrative work if you can get it. I think what intrigued me the most in the beginning was Stella herself. From how she viewed her clients, and her 'job' overall and then comparing that with her previous life. Stella isn't your typical escort, and in fact had a previous 'life' where she had a family and a successful career. Ava Marsh portrays a brutal picture of life as an escort and it's an extremely explicit read in places. That said I think it's all relevant to the story, and helps you to understand the women more. Stella is a mysterious character that we learn more about as we discover her history and I'm always impressed when a writer has you experiencing real feeling and emotion towards a fictional character, especially one that you can't really relate to, and I really felt that with Stella. She felt like a 'real' person. When a fellow escort is murdered, Stella is faced with a dilemma. She must decide whether to fight for justice for her friend, or to ignore what she's seen. It's hardly a spoiler to say that she doesn't just walk away as it'd be a pretty dull book if she did. Instead we get to witness Stella's quest for vengeance and she becomes a very easy character to like and root for, especially as she's up against some truly horrific human beings. And it just serves to show that you face danger just as much as a high-class escort as you do a low-renter on a street corner. A rather sedate build-up in the beginning leads nicely into an action-packed second half and this is a thriller in every sense of the word. My excitement and anticipation heightened by not knowing what was coming next, and I felt a strong emotional connection towards Stella and so I was right there next to her on her journey. Untouchable is a first-rate debut thriller and I'm very excited to read more from Ava Marsh."}, {"userName": "sue", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377874-sue", "userReview": "First  let me say this is an 'unputdownable' read.

A high-class call girl, but a call girl all the same and she tells you about the jobs she's doing. You get the descriptions of her work. It's not erotica, its plain English factual dialogue about what is happening and that won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're ok with most crime novels then you should be ok with this and if you are, then you will love the book.It's a book that is different in the crime genre. An escort who is the protagonist? Who you root for? Absolutely! It works and it works really well. Stella has her back story, her reasons, her past. She also has a sensible head on her shoulders and when things start to go wrong she knows it and she knows she can't stand back and do nothing. But what can an escort do? You'll just have to read this to find out and I recommend that you do. Marsh has created a brilliant and believable character in Stella, her fellow escorts and the men she services.

So, was it worth the top billing? Absolutely!Untouchable opens with an ominous threat, 'Michael says hello' being delivered to high class prostitute, Grace, but how on earth does the man know her real name? Opening three years earlier Grace Thomas aka Stella turns her first trick, sells her body for sex and with 'no more than a vague sensation of having lost my virginity all over again' she enters the world of high class prostitution. From then on a line had always been crossed in Stella's mind and there was no going back. Fast forwarding to the present day Stella is dealing with the altogether more mundane task of filing her tax return, describing in a perfectly matter-of-fact way what she can possibly claim for as expenses and how she can describe her business to the Inland Revenue. There is something fragile is Stella's narrative from the off, a sense that she is barely keeping things in check under a flinty exterior. As she goes about her day to day 'work' it becomes clear than she is a woman of contrasts, from reading Murakami to volunteering at a rape crisis centre. Her self aware narration and wry sarcasm has a huge appeal and helps to convey the impression that there is a seriously determined personality bubbling under the surface, and the clinical detailing of the sex reduces her line of work to just another occupation. There is nothing gratuitous about the sex scenes in Untouchable, rather Stella's observations are reduced to a sterile description and the details I craved were of the real woman hiding underneath it all. Stella is a fascinating protagonist and has an unerring sense of being wonderfully grounded, all adding to the impression that she is a remarkably intelligent woman. Stella is astute enough to recognise that she is running from her former life, trying to escape the misery of a past which has been lost to reproach and never being able to forgive herself for the one fatal misjudgement she made. Whilst Stella sees prostitution as her escape plan from her old life, you sense that she is an inner ball of tension, threatening to go off kilter and spiral out of control. There is an element of her actively alienating clients; not caring what they think or even worrying about the repeat business and 'user' reviews which means that the events which follow seem almost inevitable and that Stella was already leaning towards change. When a few days after a birthday party for a client, one of the two other girls who has entertained alongside Stella is found murdered in a shabby hotel room, Stella smells a rat. Despite only having worked with the murdered girl, Elisa, half a dozen times, Stella feels an obligation to not simply lie down and accept the whitewash verdict. Going to see Elisa's long term partner was a step too close to the heart of the trouble and after what she learns there is no turning back. Apparently Elisa hadn't recorded the appointment in her diary, hadn't told her partner and even paid for the hotel room where she was discovered herself. The police say that Elisa has sex in the hotel room, but why then, is there no DNA evidence of her murderer? That Stella had previously encountered the most enigmatic and self contained of the four men at the party and had seen the signs that he could spell danger certainly raised the stakes.Why does Stella go all out for justice for Elisa? Maybe because she has let herself be reduced to a shell after her own mistake and she has finally accepted that she deserves more than the misery she has been inflicting on herself relentlessly for the last five years? As it becomes clear that Stella has now become 'fair game' thanks to her active pursuit of the investigation, she finds herself in a very vulnerable position. Untouchable is a thought provoking novel about corruption and revenge, yet the most striking point was that at the end of the day, prostitution is no worse and certainly nothing different to taking any old Tom, Dick or Harry home from the pub or club for a one night stand. Taking risks shouldn't be regarded as the territory of prostitution any more intrinsically than any other casual hook up, yet it often is. Stella's volunteering at the rape crisis centre also forced me to consider the instances of rape and domestic violence which go on behind the closed doors of many marriages,Untouchable is a blood pumping, anxiety raising thriller and whilst pulling this off in real life might not be plausible, it is one hell of a ride! Whilst throughout Untouchable it is fairly clear to gain an idea as to what has sent Grace Thomas fleeing her old life and the corruption at the centre of Elisa's murder, it is altogether less clear cut how Stella will respond!! The gloves are off, Stella is fighting back from her own past and there is a wonderful sense that with this closure, Stella can return to some version of her former life. A well thought structured and all consuming read.. Now for Exposure.. A four star crime plot delivered with a five star gut wrenching thrill which had me hooked. I would hope that Untouchable is not the last appearance that Stella will make in a novel as her character has endless potential and is a very strong leading lady. I am lobbying for Stella to feature in another story, perhaps a short story catching up with her life in five years time? Hands up those in agreement?!"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5028591-andrea", "userReview": "\"This is what I do. Provide a screen for men like you to project their fantasies on. It's not about the sex \u2014if it were just about the sex you'd be happy with a quick wank. It's all about the fantasy, Ben, age you're paying me not to let the reality of myself intrude on that.\"I really enjoyed Untouchable! I wasn't quite sure what I was getting in to when I began, but I did believe it had the potential to be a fascinating read. And it was, in my opinion. Untouchable provides a stark depiction of the life of high call escorts, who are paid hundreds of dollars/hour for their time and body. The book never tries to downplay the immorality or become judgmental, it's just...real and messy (ha?), and I liked that. What Untouchable really is, though, is a thriller. When a fellow escort is murdered, with no trace of a killer, Stella/Grace reluctantly but resolutely decides to find justice for her friend. What ensues is a trail of corruption and shady dealings involving some of the most powerful players in government. And they don't take Grace's personal investigation too well. I thought the thriller aspect of the book was great. I will point out that there were a few times I became really uncomfortable reading Untouchable. There were a few times the lines between paid sex and assault were crossed, but only in order to serve the story. I did have some difficulty grasping the big mystery of Grace's past. The details are sparse throughout most of the book. I'm not sure the \"equation\" totally adds up, but it wasn't enough to completely lose me in the end. Untouchable probably won't be the book for everyone, but for me, it was a very good read."}, {"userName": "Christy LoveOfBooks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390723-christy-loveofbooks", "userReview": "Whores, murder, blackmail \u2026 of course I jumped at the chance to read Untouchable!Stella is an escort with an interesting background, and we gradually learn her full story as the book progresses. As that unfolds, she gets mixed up in a very deadly situation with some extremely powerful men, and we see how the past and present collide.There isn\u2019t much of a mystery because we know who did what and why, so it basically comes down to seeing how exactly Stella will go about handling everything and whether she\u2019ll make it out of the situation. And while it\u2019s somewhat slower at times and not as \u201cthrilling\u201d, it had a way of pulling me in and holding my attention. I blame the sex. Not really, but there is quite a bit of her escort duties involved, and I love that it wasn\u2019t glamorous or played up.Untouchable is gritty and a little darker, which I really like. Listen, I\u2019m not normally squeamish and enjoy some good effed up revenge, but I have to say, even I had to \u201clook away\u201d at one point. Not that it wasn\u2019t deserving, it just \u2026 *shivers* Stella certainly goes down a perilous path, and I kept wondering just how far she could go.So overall, Untouchable is a good book, and I look forward to more by this author."}, {"userName": "Talk Supe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5773665-talk-supe", "userReview": "Fascinating premise and a quick read. I liked that Marsh kept the plot centered on the dangers of being a working girl: STDs, being with a stranger, obsessive clients, murder, and rape. There were sexual scenes, but Marsh didn't romanticize or glorify escorting. The sex was part and parcel of the job, it's not intended to titillate.Untouchable wanted to be a thriller. It didn't quite cross that line for me. Stella was up against powerful men yet where are the threats? Where's the chase? She got off too easy with her scheme and with little consequence. I also wished that Stella's backstory was revealed earlier, maybe after she got intimate with Alex as clearly there's an attraction there, versus revealing it almost at the end. The result was I didn't get enough time to get invested in Stella. She just came across as a do-gooder and a loyal friend who wanted justice. Admirable but not convincing enough to put oneself in mortal danger. Lastly, WTH is up with the pseudo romantic HEA in the end? That came out of left field for me, not enough build up to convince me that it's going to work long term."}, {"userName": "Sue McQuaide Kitt", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11818738-sue-mcquaide-kitt", "userReview": "Untouchable was such an unexpected pleasure, I started reading this with no idea what to expect and really loved it from beginning to end.Stella/Grace is a high class professional escort who caters to the whims of very rich and powerful men.

My ReviewThe first page opens with an intimidating scene, he has his hand around her throat and a message for her. We flip back to three years prior, Grace aka Stella is an escort, prostitute, working girl, a harlot, words Grace uses to describe herself. We slip into Stella's world, sex, drugs, debauchery & danger. This is what Stella does, this is what she is good at, this is her worth in the world. One of Stella's friends ends up dead, murdered and Stella can either let it go or put herself and those around her in grave danger, will she? The story is dark, gritty and has some explicit sex scenes so it is definitely not for the easily offended or faint hearted. You are drawn into Stella's dark world, trying to work out how she ended up there, there are small clues to her former life, you know something bad happened that she is punishing herself for, but what? Your kept on the edge of your seat, there is danger from the opening page and your never sure what is coming next.A strong debut novel, packs a punch and is lined with danger, action and keeps your interest. This is my first dance with this author, I will look out for her next. A strong 4/5 for me this time, will be recommending it to friends.

I really loved this book. I was drawn to it as it sounded a bit different with a unique take on the prostitute/thriller theme-rather like a cross between a Martina Cole and Diary of a Call Girl.Grace is a high class prostitute using the name of Stella, who is well educated and conscientious. She has a \"party piece\" that makes her rather popular but you get the sense from the start that this life is her way of hiding from her past. A fellow prostitute is found murdered and Grace realises that a party they attended together is the key to the murder. Can she work out why Amanda was killed without putting herself in more danger?I really loved this-its strength lay in the main character of Grace/Stella who was a realistic, emotionally damaged woman that I really cared about. Her friend Rachel did exactly what I wanted to do, get her away from escorting into a normal life before it destroyed her. The plot wasn't predictable, I wasn't sure which way Grace was going to go right up to the final pages. Some of the scenes were quite sexual in nature (not surprising really given the premise of Untouchable!!) but I didn't find them gratuitous or distasteful. For a debut novel I found this to be of a very high standard and it keep me glued to my sofa for an entire afternoon totalling absorbed in Graces life and the moral choices she had to make. I finished it within a day-always a sign of an addictive read for me!

It was like the author was holding a carrot by a string and slowly pulled it away once I got a little information only to be keep stringing me along. It was so worth the anticipation as this book was exciting and emotional. Grace aka Stella has a past that haunts her everyday. She made some drastic changes within the past five years; she changed her name, volunteers at a rape crisis center and became an upscale call girl in London. She earns her living by providing powerful men their ultimate sexual fantasies for an hour or two. Stella is a hero with heart and a victim of her occupation; however, she\u2019s also a woman trying to live life away from her demons and the evil men she comes across.

The story revolves around Stella, a well paid escort. As the book progresses we find out about her life, past and present, her relationships, past and present and when a colleague dies soon after a \"party\" with some influential people things get messy.I was gripped by this story from the beginning and finished it within 24 hours reading at every moment I could. I loved the writing style, felt engaged with the characters - especially Stella, and I really liked her relationship with her friend Rachel, which felt very realistic. I felt that the unlikeable people in the book were also well portrayed except perhaps Harry, although this might be because he had no redeeming features at all as far as I could tell and I really didn't like him. My emotions were all over the place as I read this, feelings of empathy, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear are all so well written that you feel the effect physically, just as Stella herself does at times, gasping for air.There are some well written sex scenes in the book but they are not intrusive and fit well in the narrative, and although at times explicit, and visual, they take the story forward too, and are not salacious. I would rate this book 9/10. There was just one thing in it that I found difficult to believe, and that slightly grated on me, but I won't say what it is as it will give some of the story away.
