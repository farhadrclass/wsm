I've spent the last 24 hours thinking about it, trying to figure out a way to point out the good and the bad, instead of just listing all the things that annoyed me. Here\u2019s my conclusion: the only remotely fair thing to do is to write two separate reviews: one of the first and one of the second half of the book. First half: ***** (five stars)The first half of Ashes was one of the best things I\u2019ve read recently, and that\u2019s saying a lot! It was amazingly well written, fast paced, with interesting, layered characters and a compelling plot. Alex is a 17-year-old girl with a brain tumor. She\u2019s lost her parents a few years back and is now living with her aunt, but she spends most of her time in the hospital. At the beginning of Ashes, she is out of the hospital and has just decided not to do any more treatments, seeing as they are not helping her in any way. Instead, she chooses to go hiking in the wilderness. There she meets an old man and his granddaughter Ellie and shares a meal with them. Shortly after that, an EMP wipes out every electronic device and kills the old man in the process. That leaves Alex with the 8-year-old girl to take care of and some new abilities she doesn\u2019t fully understand. After only a short walk, the girls stumble upon two teenagers who are eating another human. It becomes pretty obvious that the EMP affected human brains as well as the electronic devices. But why then did Alex and Ellie remain unchanged?!Ok, so we have a great plot, interesting characters, a subtle love story AND zombies eating intestants and gouging out people\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s no wonder we were all so thrilled. But then the second half came\u2026Second half: ** (two stars)I can pinpoint the exact moment where it all went wrong. From the end of one chapter to the beginning of the next, everything changed. Ashes went from being amazing to being utterly unimaginative and even boring at times. I had to force myself to finish it. It picked up the pace again on the last 50 pages or so, but only to make the most horrible, cliffhanger ending possible. Here are some of my problems with the book:- Alex is 17, but she is far too skilled and mature for that to be believable, even more so because she's been very sick for a very long time. People who spend years in the hospital usually don\u2019t know that much about surviving in the wilderness. She could have been book smart, sure, but building fires?!? I don't think so. She kept saying that her father taught her, but he was dead by the time she entered her teen years. - I had the same problem with her knowledge of medicine. Apparently her mother was a doctor and they used to spend their time together stitching up chickens. Honestly, I don\u2019t know a single teen or pre-teen that interested in his/her parent\u2019s work. - I hate cliffhanger endings, and this was the mother of them all! I don\u2019t understand why authors feel the need to do that! A cliffhanger ending will make me less likely to read the next book, not more! And this particular author likes cliffhangers so much, she even ended a few chapters with them. When you end a chapter with a cliffhanger and start the next one with the words \nThree days later\n, you can count on losing a few readers. Maybe Ilsa J. Bick is a pseudonym for two people, much like Ilona Andrews, only these two people don\u2019t get along as well?!? I will still read the next book when it comes out, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m too happy about it. Michelle R., Wendy Darling and Bonnie have made this experience much better than it would have been without them.

She does not want any more treatments, is tired of hospitals, treatments, and false hope. So, when you are questioning your own survival, what do you do? You go on a \u201csurvival\u201d trip! Ok. We straight here? Good. So, Alex is in the woods. She is just minding her own business, being the withdrawn, moody teenager, when she meets 8 year old Ellie and Ellie\u2019s grandfather. We don\u2019t need to go into the details of Ellie but let\u2019s just nickname her \u201csuperbrat\u201d. Ok, so big zap, WTF, weird electrical zipzap stuff happens and this big bad pulse kills Ellie\u2019s grandfather. Oh shit. Ellie survives the zap, and Alex not only survives the zap but also regains her sense of smell, (which she had lost due to her brain tumor). But oh no, just wait, now she is a living bloodhound. Her sense of smell is off the charts. She can sense more than your basic BO, let\u2019s just say Alex\u2019s nose knows all! (sorry couldn\u2019t help it). Ok, nothing wrong here. Alex and Ellie, I mean superbrat, are surviving, moving along, surviving when they run into other teens. But wait, these aren\u2019t your average everyday teens, they are zombies! Yikes! Seems there are 3 outcomes to the big zap, 1) you survive with no side effects or heightened side effects, 2) you die or 3) you become a flesh eating zombie. And here is my warning to you- these zombies love slurping gooey eyeballs, sucking fresh intestines right out of the dying body cavity and it is all detailed in black & white. So, if you don\u2019t have a strong stomach (or intestines) you might want to skip this book. Now, don\u2019t worry, we have a boy coming into the story (it couldn\u2019t just be two young girls surviving, that would be boooorrrrinnng right?). Let us introduce Tom, he happens to be a explosive ordinance disposal expert. No problem, we\u2019ll need a bomb expert later in the book. It\u2019s a good thing one survived! Oh, and if you are worried about medical problems or surviving in the wilderness, don\u2019t you fret! Our girl Alex happens to have a Mom (sorry she is dead now) that was a doctor and a dad (that was a cop, also dead). What does that mean? Alex is skilled in sewing up her dinner (long story) and shooting guns, rifles and other weapons! It is amazing how these characters always have the perfect past to survive in these dystopian novels. Ok. So no problems here. Ellie, who is no longer superbrat, she is now a halfway decent kid, Alex, and Tom make a decent living in the woods. All is fine and the story is not that bad. In fact, up until this point\u2026.. 4 stars. AND THEN THE BOOK GOES TO HELL! After Ellie and Tom disappear (long story), Alex finds herself in this weird cult. I cannot even tell you what the hell the 2nd half of the book is about but it was so strange, and so WTF, that I kept thinking it must have been written by someone else. Overall I don\u2019t know what happened to this book. It was fine. Not the best I\u2019ve read, pretty predictable, very unrealistic but I\u2019ve come to expect that in dystopian novels. The 2nd half of the book just was awful. Simply awful.

There's a castle and a little treasure chest that opens up to send bubbles shooting up in the water. One fish is bright blue and the other is neon orange. They're about the same size and they definitely look like they'd swim around together in the ocean if left to their devices. Now imagine the very strange owner hacking the two fish in half and stitching the top of the blue fish to the lower half of the orange fish with crude Frankenstein-esque stitches. Jarring, yes?Ashes felt like reading two stories spliced together -- and not in a good way. Thankfully, both of the stories fit with the world building. Hence my two fish comparison, had the world building not matched you would've been greeted with a much weirder splicing. Still, the first and the second halves of the book are so different that I felt cheated out of the book I started reading. I felt like I was reading a choose your own adventure book and I'd chosen wrong! I kept wanting to go back to the place where Alex and Tom decided to leave the ranger station and choose another path for the story to follow.I'm getting ahead of myself though, as I so often do. Also, now might be a good time to throw out there that I have a terrible cold and cannot be held responsible for the coherency of this review.Ashes is a pretty decent end of the world book. The event isn't quite as standard as most \"zombie\" novels. The book's monsters are the author's own unique take on zombies, which are scarily more intelligent, durable, and instantly more numerous than Hollywood's version. The narrator, Alex, is self-reliant and easy to relate to. I wasn't thrilled with how she initially treated Ellie, the little girl she happens to be with when the world starts to come to an end, but she makes up for it and eventually their relationship became one of the things that interested me the most.For the first half of the book, Alex is a terminal cancer patient who has gone AWOL on her latest useless treatment for a retreat into the woods. It's one of those live because you're dying trips. She's in the woods to scatter her parents' ashes and find herself a little before she loses herself altogether. The end of the world event seems to be some sort of electromagnetic pulse. I don't think the author really knew what was going on there so she kept it as vague as possible, but I've said it before and I'll say it again: I don't expect too much in the way of big world explanations from an intimate and limited POV story.Alex is with an older man and his granddaughter when the pulse occurs. The old man dies right along with all their gear. Alex decides they have to push forward toward the ranger's station because 1. they're equally distant from the road and her car and 2. she doesn't think her car will work anyway if they get there. At first Ellie does not want to come and Alex feigns leaving her. She travels slowly so Ellie can catch up, but Ellie almost falls off the fucking mountain trying to catch up, costing them their limited supplies. At this point they haven't traveled too far from the grandfather and his bag of supplies. I was frustrated Alex didn't double back to get it, even if it meant killing the dog who guarded the old man's body. It's not like she didn't have TWO guns.Anyway, Alex and Ellie face dehydration, starvation, people who were changed in the pulse from perfectly normal to man eating, and packs of wild dogs. They are saved from one of the changed people and a pack of wild dogs by a guy named Tom. I would have liked to see Alex pull it all together, but I liked Tom all the same. They make it to the ranger station which is mysteriously abandoned. They hang out there for a few weeks. A tentative romance begins to bloom between Alex and Tom. They are safe with enough supplies to make it through the winter. For some reason Tom thinks it's a good idea to abandon that security because one of them might get hurt and there'd be no one around to help. It is, however, a nice change of pace that the guy is TSTL instead of the girl.They go along their merry way after some grim foreshadowing about how nothing was ever okay after that. This is a pet peeve of mine, authors. Please don't take a time out to warn me of scary things in your best Doomy Gloomy voice. I don't even think this counts as foreshadowing because it wasn't hinted at lightly. The author flat out told you things were going to get fucked up from here on out. This, my friends, is the end of the blue fish and the beginning of the strange orange fish.After a few days on the road they get robbed. People take their supplies and steal Ellie because children are a golden ticket into some towns. Tom tries to save Ellie and gets shot in the leg. Alex and Tom are left without supplies and without weapons. They limp along for a few miles, all while Tom becomes sicker and sicker. They bump into a town. Alex sets Tom up in a grocery store so she can go get help. When she gets back with help, Tom is mysteriously gone. Sad face. Of course, she got attacked by some creatures just outside the store where she left him and didn't think to move him after...The people Alex went to for help are a sort of religious cult that keeps the young people around for breeding. Alex isn't allowed to leave. She spots one of the men who took Ellie while she's there. The man says Ellie got away and ran off into the woods, blah blah blah. They shun the man out of the society.Alex just wants out of this crazy place, to find Ellie and Tom. She thinks about Tom obsessively and worries about Ellie, who is in all likelihood dead. I think the latter half of this book could have been more connected to the first half if either Tom or Ellie had remained a consistent presence throughout the book. Instead, Ellie is swapped out for teenage girls in the same situation as Alex and Tom is swapped out as a love interest for Chris, the grandson of the leader of the weird cult. More weirdness ensues including a trippy ending that made very little sense. (I don't think it was supposed to make sense so that the cliff hanger would be bigger.) Honestly I can't be bothered to recap it. I just kept wanting to go back to the first half of the story and get Tom and Ellie back. I couldn't get invested in anyone new because I was terribly distracted.The first half of the book is a solid four stars. The second half is a sort of flat two stars. Three it is. I might read the next book to see if it gets back on course, but I think the erratic writing is not something one can easily recover from."}, {"userName": "Anagha Uppal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4458145-anagha-uppal", "userReview": "Review also posted on my visitable blog!A fast-paced, riveting read.\u201cIt was that stages-of-anger thing. I was shocked and then I got pissed and then I fought like hell \u2026 and then I went numb. They called it acceptance, but it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s what happens when you have only two choices: live with the monster, or kill yourself.\u201dAlex thought the shrink was full of shit. Her parents were dead.She knew that. The dream was all about her life jumping the rails,blowing up in her face, leaving her with nothing but ashes.If I had to pick my favorite dystopian reads, Ashes would be right up there at the top of it (along with Hunger Games, 1984, Blood Red Road, Gone, and Enclave). I've read Ashes twice, and each time, it gripped me with an iron fist until the end (and even after). When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about the latest twist in the story and after finishing last December, I obsessed about the crazy cliffhanger for months... actually, right up until the the day I got my hands on the sequel!!Ashes starts out with an almost-teary goodbye with Alex's aunt on the phone because she's about to hike out into the mountains for a week-long trip before she becomes too weak (she has terminal cancer - heartbreaking, I know). But of course, our resourceful protagonist can't just die! She meets this old guy and his 8-year-old granddaughter while sitting on top of a mountain, and suddenly, some kind of invisible laser of intense pain (you'll have to read Ashes to find out what it really is!!) attacks all of them, leaving the man dead, Ellie weeping, and Alex... different. Cancer had taken away her sense of smell but somehow, she can now smell everything around her, including things normal people can't smell like fear and lies. What's more - most teenagers have reacted to this beam by becoming flesh-eating zombies - the alive, fast, and insanely dangerous kind.If you like horror movies or shows like The Walking Dead, you're definitely going to enjoy Ashes. Not only is it fast-paced and gritty, it is also super gory (guys, if you're looking for a book, this was made for you). Those who might be squeamish about reading explicit descriptions of regular-looking people renting human flesh, rupturing bellies, and enjoying the meal, close this review and don't look back. My favorite scenes of this book were two of the most spine-tingling moments I've ever had the pleasure of reading - even I turned my head in disgust. The rest is pure evasion and fighting to live through the horrifying circumstances.Instead of banding together, the survivors (mostly elderly people) grow desperate and steal and kill each other for their goods. It's a dangerous world, but Tom, Alex and Ellie (who's just the best character in dystopian lit - she's so small and goes from a whiny, snot-filled kid to a survivor) manage to navigate it... well, that is until a small gang steals Ellie and their supplies, and injures Tom (possibly fatally). Then, Alex must travel alone to find help from the nearby town of Rule... leading to Part 4 - Rule!This was the dullest part of the novel, and in my opinion, the portion that could have been much shorter. It's all about her getting to Rule, finally finding safety, and falling instantly in love with a dude called Chris. They're all passionate and lovey-dovey, in contrast with the rest of the book where there were at most two kissing scenes. This portion served mostly to create an unnecessary love triangle. BUT this part totally and utterly redeemed through the aforementioned cliffhanger, where Alex realizes just what the town leaders are up to. And I can't say anymore in fear of spoiling this fantastic book :DI CANNOT wait to start Shadows (the sequel).

While out in the wilderness, an event occurs that prevents the use of her electronic devices; she later discovers that an EMP had gone off and had not only shut down all electronic devices but killed billions. She begins caring for 8 year old Ellie as her grandfather was one of the first people killed by the EMP. Alex begins noticing that she\u2019s changing in ways that she can\u2019t explain. For one, her brain tumor had caused her to lose her sense of smell and taste but following the EMP those senses not only come back to her but they are heightened like never before. The changes continue in her throughout the story.First impressions? Alex was not an immediately likable character but she does grow on you after some time. I\u2019d say around the time the other main character, Tom, is introduced she starts acting like a likable human being.Second? This CANNOT be a young adult book. This was one of the most gruesome books I have read in a LONG time. Not to say it wasn\u2019t amazing, because it was, but planning meals around reading this book to make sure that you\u2019re don\u2019t have food in your stomach and/or are about to eat was essential. (I can stomach most things, I\u2019m not exactly squeamish, but man can this author describe your internal organs. Lol)One main issue I have with this book, which actually is an issue I have with many \u2018YA\u2019 books, is the situations that the author puts the characters in and how these characters act in these situations does not fit their age. The way that Alex acts in this book does not fit a 17 year old I don\u2019t care how mature you are for your age. Tom was a bit more believable because he was in his 20\u2019s and he had been in the army and had proper training and such.Possible spoilers\u2026My second issue was the fact that the first half of the book was super exciting and I loved every minute of it. It seemed like as soon as I hit 50% it just went immediately downhill. She got to the town Rule and I got seriously lost because all of these new characters were thrown in the mix and I got so confused keeping everybody straight. Plus? No zombies. No gruesome gory internal organ comments. Just life in this weird religious cult amish society. Just weird. I was trending on 4 stars up until the second half. And I missed Tom. No Tom, no zombies, the second half sucked. The author seemed to be following an interesting path in the storyline but then at the half mark she went in a completely different direction and I didn\u2019t like it one bit. It seemed to me as if the first half was about survival and the bonds of friendship and such, and then the second half turned into some weird love triangle and it was completely inappropriate as far as I\u2019m concerned. Didn\u2019t fit at all with the rest of the story.Compared to the many other dystopian novels I\u2019ve read recently, this one lacked the realism that many others had. Ashfall, for example, was believable and you could imagine each and every eventually happening. With this novel, I don\u2019t know if these characters just had bad luck but it just seemed to me like they were constantly dealing with a ridiculous amount of shit. Sure the world has gone to hell, but these damn kids just could not catch a break. Maybe that\u2019s the way it\u2019ll truly be if things like this ever happen, but for me it just didn\u2019t seem realistic.It\u2019s not often that I will read a book that is the start of a new series and not want to continue. There\u2019s either a cliffhanger that forces me to or an overall desire to see what happens to the characters. The ending of this book did not have me feeling the need to continue, the last half of the book just ruined the good parts, very disappointed!"}, {"userName": "Jake Rideout", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2518097-jake-rideout", "userReview": "This book was completely not what I was expecting. Although, rereading the back, I'm not sure why I was so surprised. The back cover reads: An electromagnetic pulse sweeps through the sky, destroying every electronic device and killing billions. For those spared, it's a question of who can be trusted and who is no longer human...Desperate to find out what happened and to avoid the Changed, Alex meets up with Tom--a young army veteran--and Ellie, a young girl whose grandfather was killed by the electromagnetic pulse.This improvised family will have to use every ounce of courage they have just to survive. My first surprise was the writing. It seems like there are dozens of post-apocalyptic novels getting published these days, in the wake of The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner, and quality of writing is not always the first consideration. This book, though, is actually well-written. Ilsa J. Bick obviously has a vast knowledge of guns, wilderness survival, emergency medicine, and human biology, and her descriptions are detailed yet accessible. It's not all about the action, though--Alex's emotions are vivid and real.The second surprise was the scope of the novel. This is no cookie-cutter action book, where monsters keep popping out of nowhere and the characters are running helter-skelter from one disaster to the next. There are quiet periods. A realistic amount of time passes. I was not exhausted and glad to be finished with the book when I came to the end. And the world is complex, well thought-out.There is one similarity with other post-apocalypse novels: the cliffhanger ending. I should have been ready for it, since I was very clearly approaching the end with no resolution in sight, but I was still thrown for a loop.

I tend to get bored and zone out when confronted with pages and pages of endless action, but I\u2019m in a book club now and I\u2019m trying to be good. I felt especially obligated to read this one because I already skipped the one from last month. Even though this book is very decidedly an ACTION, gore, survival, DRAMA read, I\u2019m glad I tried it. The best part of this book for me was that it was narrated by Katherine Kellgren. She\u2019s one of my all-time favorite audiobook narrators, and as Flannery pointed out, I may or may not have somewhat of a crush on this woman. (The most awesome thing is that if we got married and had the same last name, except for our first initials we\u2019d essentially have the same name. That would probably come in handy for taxes and stuff.) The worst part of this book for me was the ACTIONACTIONACTION, which is about 75% of the book. Thankfully, when Katherine Kellgren is narrating those parts she reminds me so much of Anne Shirley reciting The Highwayman in the Kevin Sullivan adaptation of Anne of Green Gables that I couldn\u2019t help smiling through my utter boredom. The book begins with the main character Alex heading out for an extended camping trip in the wilderness. She has been struggling with cancer for several years and finally decides to seize what life she has left and enjoy it \u2013 in the woods. Which, except for the seclusion, is completely not how I would choose to spend my remaining days. Give me a nice hotel room with a well-stocked pantry, internet access, and a giant library so I don\u2019t need to speak to anyone and we\u2019re golden. Or failing that, how about indoor plumbing? I feel like indoor plumbing is a necessity for my final days. Anyway, it turns out that Alex made the right choice in this situation because a few days into her trip an electromagnetic pulse kills off the majority of the adult population, leaving behind only a handful of the elderly and many large hordes of teenage cannibalistic killing machines (why this strange pulse kills some and zombifies others is never really explained). Alex is one of the few teenagers left \u201cspared\u201d and with Ellie, a young girl she meets at her campsite and Tom, another spared, she struggles to navigate this new world.This book is wilderness survival from start to finish, but the electromagnetic pulse-activated zombie teenager survival and controlling cult society survival (which she throws in at around the halfway point) really kept me interested. Water rationing/shelter building/foraging for food can only entertain me for so long \u2013 but give me twisty/dark psychological action and survival and I can hang in there. Ellie is one of the most annoying little girl characters in the entire world, and this is coming from someone who has the kind of tolerance for little girl whining that can only be gained through almost seven years of constant exposure to it. I also had a hard time with Alex\u2019s feelings for Tom (as if you didn\u2019t see that coming). Her perceived connection to him felt way too sudden for me, although; by the end of the first half I could see why they would be fairly close.It\u2019s mainly for these reasons that I am probably the only person(if all of my friends\u2019 reviews are to be believed) who actually liked the second half of this book more than the first. Number one, I was quite happy to see Tom and Ellie exit the stage. Number two, the crazy claustrophobic and misogynistic environment of Rule was so much more interesting to me than the woods. However, by the end Alex\u2019s voice really started to grate on me - to the point where I actually started longing for a little Ellie time. I felt like Alex spent every single moment when she wasn\u2019t engaging in ACTIONACTIONACTION either debating with herself about hypothetical details or making wild conjectures about Rule \u2013 all without spending any time actually looking for evidence that would support her theories. She just makes assumption after assumption after assumption. It drove me insane. Her actions at the end of the book make absolutely no sense to me.Overall, this was an entertaining read with a fantastic narrator that kept me going through the more tedious portions of my life. It ends on a massive cliffhanger, so be prepared for that. I was unable to stop myself from requesting the sequel and plowing right into it. I\u2019ll be posting a review for Shadows later this week!

I loved, loved, LOVED Draw the Dark so much that Ilsa could have written PUDDING!!! in blue crayon for 180 pages and I still would have wanted to read it. Guys, I don't love books like this very often but DRAW? OMFG love. So I saw a chance to jump at ASHES and I took it.After some back and forth I ended up with a copy and my ultimate goal was to read it before BEA and then gush about it here and send my attending readers over to her signings to get copies. Obviously I'm just reviewing it now but gush I did already. And I hadn't even finished it at that point. Now that I've finished it, I want to consume it piece by piece, perhaps marinated in a nice remoulade sauce, so I an absorb her talent for my own.Srsly, ASHES is an apocalyptic/dystopian novel that all other YA apocalyptic/dystopian novels should aspire to. None of those lazy worldbuilding, OMG lurve triangle piles of horse poop. Well, there's a little bit of a love triangle but it's more like two disjointed lines that haven't connected yet that are on like 25% opacity in Photoshop. It's all about the world and the characters surviving in it. Everything is so expertly figured out that it's hard, if not impossible, to find loopholes in the logic. The shit that should happen does. Nothing is conveniently explained away. There are no fades to black and then POOF everything is better. Logic rules. Science rules. This all makes the story pwn.Alex is one hell of a strong, resilient character that almost wasn't. To keep this review spoiler-free, I won't say why but I will say when this girl needs to keep pushing forward, there isn't much that'll be able to stand in her way. And just when you think she gives up, she slaps you upside the head and proves you wrong. Ellie is the type of character you want to slap. Yeah she's young and scared but Alex is a better person than I probably would be if our roles were switched. Would I leave Ellie behind? No. Would I slap the snot right out of her when she gets petulant? Probably. At the very least be screaming my head off. My patience with children is pretty low under normal circumstances. And Tom. Dear Tom. What a saving grace he was. A perfect compliment, filling in the gaps in Alex's survival knowledge. And I loved how Ilsa balanced that relationship that, for the most part, wasn't there like it is in many other similar books.One of the reasons why I liked ASHES so much. Romance isn't the focus. It's hardly even a blip on the radar. The book is about the world, the destruction of it and these characters' subsequent survival. Romance is tertiary at best and that's how I like it. There's just enough in there to spark something but she has you so sucked into the world that it doesn't really matter.Ilsa's writing is detailed almost to a fault. There were a couple of places where it went on a little too long and gave a few too many details that probably wouldn't have hurt the story if they were removed but ultimately I didn't mind. All that detail played well when it mattered. Again, no spoilers but I will recommend not reading this book while eating anything. There were many times I found myself a little nauseous reading some of the things that happened. In a good way, if that's possible.I alluded to it before but I'll say it straight out: Ilsa is merciless with her characters. She shows them no mercy. Anything that can happen to them will. They don't get reprieves, they don't get spared, they don't amazingly escape dangerous situations without some damage done at least. Logic holds strong to these characters and just because Alex is the MC doesn't mean she's boo-boo free. Holy hell no. If anything she gets it the worst. Ilsa does everything with her characters that I hope to do with mine. It takes true bravery to submit your babies to this kind of torture and I commend her for it. Not many authors do this and it makes her work all the stronger for it.And last but not least, there are zombies. Sort of. They're not the already-dead-and-then-alive type of zombies. They're Changed. And evolving. Oh man they evolve and that makes them all the more terrifying.Seriously, this book is terrifying. It will have you looking up at the sky and wondering what if. Because it could happen. It makes sense. So why wouldn't it? Truly frightening that at any second ZAP! Gone. And what then? ASHES is the type of apocalyptic/dystopian novel that gives other like-minded novels complexes. It puts them to shame in terms of worldbuilding and character development. And the ending? GAHHHHHHHHHHHH! If you don't want to read more after that ending, then go to a hospital and have them check your pulse because I think you might be dead.Read ASHES. Now. Or when it comes out. You will not regret it."}, {"userName": "Schokigirl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27136310-schokigirl", "userReview": "Sind jetzt doch nur 4,5 Sterne geworden, weil es an der spannendsten Stelle einfach abgebrochen wurde & weil Alex mir gegen Ende zu lange absichtlich auf dem Schlauch stand.

She does not want any more treatments, is tired of hospitals, treatments, and false hope. So, when you are questioning your own survival, what do you do? You go on a \u201csurvival\u201d trip! Ok. We straight here? Good.So, Alex is in the woods. She is just minding her own business, being the withdrawn, moody teenager, when she meets 8 year old Ellie and Ellie\u2019s grandfather. We don\u2019t need to go into the details of Ellie but let\u2019s just nickname her \u201csuperbrat\u201d.Ok, so big zap, WTF, weird electrical zipzap stuff happens and this big bad pulse kills Ellie\u2019s grandfather. Oh shit.Ellie survives the zap, and Alex not only survives the zap but also regains her sense of smell, (which she had lost due to her brain tumor). But oh no, just wait, now she is a living bloodhound. Her sense of smell is off the charts. She can sense more than your basic BO, let\u2019s just say Alex\u2019s nose knows all! (sorry couldn\u2019t help it).Ok, nothing wrong here. Alex and Ellie, I mean superbrat, are surviving, moving along, surviving when they run into other teens. But wait, these aren\u2019t your average everyday teens, they are zombies! Yikes! Seems there are 3 outcomes to the big zap, 1) you survive with no side effects or heightened side effects, 2) you die or 3) you become a flesh eating zombie.And here is my warning to you- these zombies love slurping gooey eyeballs, sucking fresh intestines right out of the dying body cavity and it is all detailed in black & white. So, if you don\u2019t have a strong stomach (or intestines) you might want to skip this book.Now, don\u2019t worry, we have a boy coming into the story (it couldn\u2019t just be two young girls surviving, that would be boooorrrrinnng right?). Let us introduce Tom, he happens to be a explosive ordinance disposal expert. No problem, we\u2019ll need a bomb expert later in the book. It\u2019s a good thing one survived! Oh, and if you are worried about medical problems or surviving in the wilderness, don\u2019t you fret! Our girl Alex happens to have a Mom (sorry she is dead now) that was a doctor and a dad (that was a cop, also dead). What does that mean? Alex is skilled in sewing up her dinner (long story) and shooting guns, rifles and other weapons! It is amazing how these characters always have the perfect past to survive in these dystopian novels.Ok. So no problems here. Ellie, who is no longer superbrat, she is now a halfway decent kid, Alex, and Tom make a decent living in the woods. All is fine and the story is not that bad. In fact, up until this point\u2026.. 4 stars.AND THEN THE BOOK GOES TO HELL!After Ellie and Tom disappear (long story), Alex finds herself in this weird cult. I cannot even tell you what the hell the 2nd half of the book is about but it was so strange, and so WTF, that I kept thinking it must have been written by someone else. OverallI don\u2019t know what happened to this book. It was fine. Not the best I\u2019ve read, pretty predictable, very unrealistic but I\u2019ve come to expect that in dystopian novels. The 2nd half of the book just was awful. Simply awful.

Es una novela post-apocal\u00edptica con una ambientaci\u00f3n interesante y con una idea general que me ha gustado mucho. Empec\u00e9 a leerla sin saber qu\u00e9 esperar de ella, el tema zombies me gusta mucho pero lo cierto es que la contraportada y la portada no me llamaban demasiado la atenci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, me ha sorprendido positivamente.Por un lado me ha gustado mucho la ambientaci\u00f3n de Cenizas porque, si bien es cierto que es muy t\u00f3pica, est\u00e1 muy bien descrita y sit\u00faa perfectamente a la lectora en la historia. Es muy t\u00f3pico el bosque post-apocal\u00edptico -por no hablar del tema de los zombies en s\u00ed- pero la autora le da a todo un lavado de cara. Los zombies ya no son lo que eran y lo convierte en algo original e innovador. Esta punto me ha gustado mucho.Tambi\u00e9n me ha gustado el ritmo trepidante que tiene y c\u00f3mo la novela absorbe a la lectora. Me enganch\u00e9 desde el primer momento y le\u00ed las 200 primeras p\u00e1ginas en una hora a las tres de la madrugada. No pod\u00eda parar de leer y cuando lo hac\u00eda era porque ten\u00eda que dormir o deb\u00eda dejarlo por alguna raz\u00f3n. Porque sinceramente, esta novela me ha atrapado much\u00edsimo.Lo que m\u00e1s me ha gustado ha sido la primera mitad de la misma porque a partir de la segunda todo empieza a decaer un poco. Las cosas pasan demasiado r\u00e1pido, la trama da un giro extra\u00f1o y no termin\u00f3 de convencerme.Hay detalles que se me han quedado fuera de lugar. Por ejemplo, el tumor cerebral de Alex lo veo fuera de lugar y poco necesario. La protagonista no necesitaba ese tumor y se queda descolgado en la trama. Me parece a\u00f1adirle un drama absurdo que est\u00e1 de adorno en la novela.Los personajes tampoco los veo muy bien trabajados. Alex es muy plana, Tom y Ellie tienen poca profundidad. Espero que esto cambie en las pr\u00f3ximas novelas.El tema de los zombies me gusta mucho y me encanta c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n tratados en esta novela y qu\u00e9 explicaci\u00f3n va dando a todo la autora. Me ha gustado, lo he disfrutado much\u00edsimo y me deja con ganas de saber m\u00e1s de esos zombies.En resumen, es una primera parte de trilog\u00eda buena, que tiene un ritmo incre\u00edble, que me ha atrapado como no lo ha hecho ninguna otra novela en mucho tiempo, que tiene ciertos detalles que espero ver mejorados en su segunda parte y que me ha dejado con ganas de mucho m\u00e1s.

This book has easily become one of my favorites. I had Ashes sitting on my shelves for almost a year when I decided to pick it up. I finished it in less than a day and went straight to the bookstore for the second book. The characters are great. Alex has a tough background and when she is partnered up with an 8 year old with a bunch of attitude it makes the story great. Then a mysterious ex-army cadet is introduced and it makes it amazing.

It changed the whole plot of the story and at first I was disappointed but when I finished the book it made me think, how often does a book manage to surprise you?

Bick seems to create a well fleshed out character in Alex effortlessly. She is vulnerable for reasons I don't want to spoil, yet capable and independent. Like Alex, Tom quickly comes across as a real person, a genuinely good, real person. And Ellie. Ellie is a kid with issues. (I actually pictured Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl from the movie Kickass--attitude, not violence--when I read Ellie.)Not only are the characters intriguing and unique, but the plot! The plot is so different from what I've come to expect in the YA genre. It is gritty and suspenseful and plausible enough to willingly suspend my disbelief. It basically starts right before an apocalyptic event that changes most of the population in a catastrophic way and takes us beyond it into the very new post-apocalyptic landscape. The problem with this book (why I didn't give it 5 stars) comes in just past the middle. I'm not exaggerating one bit when I say it reads like Bick had two VERY different versions of this manuscript and just spliced them together. Midway through everything about the focus of the book shifts. All of the existing plot threads and characters (with the exception of Alex) are basically cut and all new ones manifest the way they should in the beginning of a book. For me this was a huge let down for the plot. Because the initial story arc basically gets severed, the resolution at the end of the book only addresses the new arc, challenges, and characters introduced halfway through the book. Another problem, that may just be personal preference, is that the first half was far superior to the second, so the drastic shift was even more disappointing. Also the strength I loved in Alex through the first half seemed conspicuously absent in the second half.It's hard for me to discuss the details of this book without giving too much away, and half of the enjoyment for me with this story was the discovery. It's part sci-fi, part post-apocalypse, part zombie, part wilderness survival, and the telling was extremely visual and well-paced.This is the strangest 3 stars I've ever given a book. What it really breaks down to is 5 stars for the first half of the book and 2 stars for the second half. I am very optimistic for the next book, hoping Bick can get the story back on track, and personally hoping she returns to some of the characters and plot threads she ditched halfway through."}, {"userName": "Matt Mead YA Librarian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4553401-matt-mead-ya-librarian", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to get my hands on an ARC of Ilsa Bick's fantastic new book Ashes, which is scheduled for publication in September.I enjoyed Draw the Dark, but this book totally blew me away. I'm almost sad that I got it as an ARC since now I'll have to wait longer for the sequel than I would have had to wait if I had picked up this book in September. The plot is original and well paced. There are structural similarities to the Hunger Games and Dashner's The Maze Runner that give this book a read-alike feel and should appeal to fans of both of those series. The story centers around Alex, a teenage girl who is hiking in the Upper Peninsula, when a catastrophic electromagnetic pulse destroys all electronic devices and apparently the brains of most people in the area if not the whole world. Some people simply died when the EMP occurred, but a number of people, particularly people around Alex's age have turned into raging cannibalistic zombie types referred to as \"the Changed\". She meets up with other survivors and together they attempt to find safe haven, but that's hard to do when even other survivors are likely to shoot teenagers on sight in fear that they are changed. Twists and turns appear at just the right places, a love triangle is set up (a la Peeta and Gale) and the cliffhanger ending is so perfectly unexpected that the anticipation for the next volume in this series is almost painful.

Bick earned the one start rating. I disliked it, and anyone who has been around me for the last few weeks can testify to this fact. I was very verbal about it. But I had to finish it, just so I could give you a complete picture on why this story irks me to my very core.Don't listen to them, because trust me, this is not any foreseeable future. It's science fiction, plain and simple, not any accurate description of what would actually happen in the case of an Electra-magnetic Pulse. I don't care that this fact is true (even though a lot of the logic behind it seems quite flawed and ludicrousness), it just bothers me that everyone keeps saying stuff like \"a glimpse of what our world can turn into at any moment\"--which its not.Second myth I'd like to personally dispel about Ashes: It doesn't have zombies. I know, all you Ashes fangirls and fanboys just went \"Yes huh! There are totally zombies.\" First of all, the only thing the cannibalistic kids have in common with zombies is that they smell like rot and they eat human flesh. I am not a zombie purist. I am okay with the zombies being able to run or climb or have fine motor skills or whatever but these are NOT zombies. 1. They do not infected others. They just eat them. 2. They are not DEAD. They smell dead. But they can freeze to death, and even can starve and can be killed very easily. 3. They are smart. Zombies are primitive at best. What ever these creatures are, that are not primitive, they are smart and organized. So they are not zombies. And this isn't even Bick's fault because not once do I think they actually call them zombies.Moving on. Beyond the fact that this book was severely unrealistic, the main character being unlikable, and how desperately boring it could be, it was radically inconsistent. The beginning seemed (while completely misleading) a story about survival and being among the last survivors. The second half of the book was completely different. It was about cults and society and church and rights. It felt like I was reading to entirely different stories. And might I add that the second half of the book was just stupid. That is the only word I could think to use. It described a society that had apparently already set up a new system: said screw the US we are going with our backward hick, Christian view, we got the Council of Five and all our obscure one word titles for things like The Changed, The Awakened, The Spared, blah blah blah. Trust me, if you read it, you will agree with me on this fact, it was stupid.The saddest part of this book is it falls for the saddest YA trope of all time: the love triangle. I should call it the appending love triangle because it hasn't really become an issue yet, but it is so clear. I could sense it since the moment she met the second love interest. I don't understand if this is a ploy to get little hopeless romantic teenage girls to gobble up books, or if Bick sincerely thought she was original. Ilsa J. Bick, if you read this, let me just say this one thing to you: this was the single most unoriginal thing in the entire story and ought to have been rethought completely. Who told you this was a good idea? It's not.Finally, the writing was terrible. I appreciate diction, syntax, figurative language, and all of those fun literature words. But Ashes lacked those things or they were very poorly done. I strongly urge you to skip this one."}, {"userName": "Leigh Collazo", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4141951-leigh-collazo", "userReview": "More reviews at http://readerpants.blogspot.comWhat I liked: More, please!!! The Stand, The Hunger Games, Chaos Walking, and now Ashes. I do love me some apocalyptic fiction, and I read Ashes compulsively. I read it at the breakfast table, in the closet waiting out a tornado warning, in the bathroom, in the car, at the eye doctor, at the gym. I even skipped the American Idol Finale to finish it. When I wasn't reading it, I was talking it up to others or thinking about it. Quite simply, literary euphoria. While there are relatively few characters for much of the book, the main three (Alex, Tom, and Ellie) are complex, courageous, and believably flawed. Alex's sardonic references to her brain tumor show that while she accepts that the tumor will eventually kill her, she won't be going down without a fight. She's a survivor who can navigate the wilderness and isn't at all squeamish around guns and knives. While at first Tom seems a bit too good to be true, he's clearly battling his own demons and, like Alex, does not back down from doing what's necessary to survive. Little Ellie is understandably bitter and has been through more than any eight-year old girl should; readers will easily forgive her bad attitude once they learn more about her struggles. She's only eight, after all.Bick sets up a love triangle that I can't wait to see develop in second book. While both romances are a bit predictable, the leading men are likeable enough that many readers will root for them both. Bick left herself lots of room to expand both male characters in later books; there is more to them than meets the eye.What I didn't like: The events of the last 50 pages happen so quickly that they are confusing. I closed the book and thought, \"What just happened there?\" Like Alex, I have lots of unanswered questions, which leaves me anticipating the sequel even more. Content: Language: mild-medium; language is sprinkled throughout, but it is not at all gratuitous Sexuality: mild-medium; some kissing, talk of young women being necessary to continue species; a couple of references to menstruation Violence: extremely high; very graphic descriptions of \"The Changed\" eating various human body parts; several murders; lots of gore and blood. Not for weak stomachs. Drugs/Alcohol: nothing more than aspirin, ibuprofen for pain; medical drugs in surgery and cancer treatmentsStatus in my library: Oh, the conflict! I would love to get this one and can think of several students who would definitely love it. The gore is my main concern, and I rarely reject a book for the library based solely on violence. I do get tons of requests for \"the scariest book in the library\" or \"a book with murders,\" and Ashes would fit both. Requests for \"zombie books\" can be difficult to fill, and this would satisfy that niche as well. As gory as it is, I do believe there is a middle school audience for Ashes. As a former middle schooler myself, I know I would have loved it."}, {"userName": "Katrina Passick Lumsden", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1964146-katrina-passick-lumsden", "userReview": "Realistic, likable characters and an intriguing plot line. What more could you ask for? How about religious undertones (both for and against), a little romance, science fiction, modern warfare, survivalism, mysterious superpowers, and honest-to-god zombie teenagers? I can't help it, I love this book. Alex, our heroine, isn't some simpering, helpless idiot. Sure, she doesn't make the brightest decisions at times, but she knows how to take care of herself. Finally, a protagonist my inner feminist doesn't have to shy from or be ashamed of. The peripheral characters are surprisingly well-written. Ellie is like a small mirror image of Alex, but with her own unique twist. Tom is the valiant hero who has issues but, refreshingly, doesn't wallow in self-pity like certain other YA men. The trauma and dangers encountered are realistic enough that I didn't feel like it had been whitewashed for the sake of sensitive readers. After all, those of us who are most interested in these stories usually aren't super sensitive to gore and violence. I found myself actually relating to the characters in a way I'm not often capable of. This book had me alternately tense, confused (in a good, effective way), heartbroken, and incensed (also in a good, effective way). I couldn't help but root for Alex as she tries, against some fairly insurmountable odds, to do what she believes is right. I've read a lot of reviews on this book and I see a lot of people were disappointed with the way the story shifts in the middle. To this I say....annnnd? All stories have turning points, this just happens to be the turn this story took. You either like it or you don't, I guess. It didn't bother me. Sure, I stared at the chapter after the cliffhanger with a little incredulity, but it's not like it was difficult to catch up, and the situation Alex finds herself in later is the set-up for the rest of the series, sooo...yeah, I guess I just don't get the anger.

So that's says something about how much I liked this one."}, {"userName": "Aoife", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16768476-aoife", "userReview": "I devoured Ashes..Re-Read 07/08/13It is written in a way that you almost don't realise how quickly you're making it through the book, the chapters are short and easy to read.The plot is simple to understand and Alex's telling of it doesn't mix words around. She tells it as it is, blood and teeth scattered across the ground, entrails being sucked like spagetti, eyeballs being popped out and eaten...it's almost refreshing in a gruesome and 'thank god it's only a story way'.I do agree with other reviews in that the book is separated into two different parts, there is the fast paced half with Alex travelling with Ellie and Tom and then the second half when she finds the Amish like town with strict rules and regulations and with people who are very unlikable.The ending of the book, for me, was great. It made me gasp out loud and unfortunately for me, I had read Ashes shortly after its publication, meaning I was rocking back and forth in anticipation for a whole year before Shadows..It is a good book...and besides how can you not like a book where dogs are the best things to have by your side!"}, {"userName": "Carol (StarAngel's Reviews) Allen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6294320-carol-starangel-s-reviews-allen", "userReview": "OK...so another YA apocolypse zombie/changed but this one gripped me and it held my interest! I want to know more after finishing but....a few reasons why I will stop with this one.1. A love triangle2. Multiple POV's (yeah curiousity got me and I snuck a few peeks)I like Tom and I like Chris....one of them is going to get hurt...and that's where I have to draw the line on reading further. I'll only be setting myself up for disappointment.Other than that....this definitely was an off beat story with a different twist to the apocolypse. Kudos to the author for thinking of that different type of spice to add to the story!Full of action and sadness...I did almost catch myself tearing up a few times!"}], "description": "It could happen tomorrow . . .An electromagnetic pulse flashes across the sky, destroying every electronic device, wiping out every computerized system, and killing billions.Alex hiked into the woods to say good-bye to her dead parents and her personal demons.
