I was hoping for an engaging narrative of life as a French Resistance fighter during WWII and this fell far from the mark. I wanted to hear about the hardships and underground tactics, the struggle of the people and their sacrifice. I got a little of that, but mostly I got a whole lot about a rich French family and how they didn't really want to talk about the war. Certainly this family suffered tragedy at the hands of the Nazi. Torture, incarceration and death was indeed the cost of their courage. But sadness and loss alone do not make much of a book. There's a reason obituaries are short. Description of the family's struggle are minimal or occasionally inconsequential. Details of the war in general are used as lengthy filler. It feels like this book was stretching out what little story it possessed. One of the principle participants wrote a \"dry\" memoir of 45 pages on the topic of her and her family's involvement in the resistance. Charles Kaiser didn't think that was enough, but I think she got it right.I listened to The Cost of Courage via audiobook and that was a bad choice. For some reason, the author decided to read this himself and he is a terrible reader, one of the worst I've encountered on a professional production. Much of the book is written in present tense. I guess that was Kaiser's attempt to make the history more exciting, to make it feel more immediate, in hopes of turning passive prose into something actively impactful. It didn't. Honestly, listening to him it sounded more like he was reading the scenes and actions from a movie script: \"Jack and Jill go up a hill to fetch a pail of water. Jack falls down and breaks his crown. Jill comes tumbling after.\"What made it worse was Kaiser's habit of trailing off at the end of each sentence. Imagine reading the Three Little Pigs like this: \"AND THEN THE BIG BAD WOLF HUFFED!!! AND PUFFED!!! and blew the house down.\" *whooosh!* goes the wind right out of the damn sails."}, {"userName": "Skip", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1389748-skip", "userReview": "I won this book as a Goodreads giveaway (yay!) It is non-fiction book about Occupied France, although the central focus is the Boulloche family, who three children were members of the French resistance, who actively opposed the German occupation and Vichy government. I would have preferred more details about the family's activities and less history, but I think their modesty kept much of their contributions secret. In fact, Kaiser's perseverance in gaining the family's trust was extraordinary by all accounts. I was less interested in the Normandy invasion and the key role the resistance played in distracting the Germans and disrupting the flow of trains and tanks to battle the Allies."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "3.5 or a little more.Disclaimer: ARC via Netgalley\tAt the end of his book, Charles Kaiser writes that the average American doesn\u2019t know anything, if much, about the French Resistance. He\u2019s most likely correct. The Cost of Courage details the struggles that the Boulloche family went though during the Second World War when France was taken over by Germany. Three of the Boulloches, Christiane, Jaqueline, and Andre- join the Resistance while their parents and elder brother do not. The emphasis is on the family during the war, though the second part deals with the surviving family members\u2019 lives after the war.\tThere is one crucial element to Kaiser\u2019s style that will no doubt put some people off. He writes in present tense. This might have been done to make the story seem more real or to have a stronger connection with the reader. It doesn\u2019t work for me, and this is a matter of personal taste.\tIn some ways, Kaiser\u2019s book is similar to Corrie Ten Bloom\u2019s Hiding Place, though it lacks a religious underpinning and the Boulloches resisted more due to patriotism and a sense of justice. It is the idea of justice and morality that connects the Boulloches to the more devout ten Blooms. \tThe story of the Boulloches is interwoven with a more general history of the war. In some ways this is understandable, it places the events in a wider context, but at the same time it distracts from the central story and feels, at times, like so much filler. Perhaps this could have been alleviated somewhat by a closer focus on France during the War instead of Germany and France. While Kaiser is correct in that history does tend to gloss over French and German resistance to Hitler (few Americans, for instance, can recognize the White Rose, despite the fact that the group does get some attention in the United States Holocaust Museum), trying to correct both those issues in one short book doesn\u2019t work simply because of space. In many ways, keeping the focus on the French Resistance would have been better.\tKaiser no doubt will also receive some criticism for his lack of dealing directly with Holocaust, but it is unclear how much of the genocide he could have brought in considering that the Boulloches seemed to be motivated by French patriotism and were not Jewish. Kaiser does mention that Christiane disliked a Jewish teacher losing her job due to the regulations, but he also makes it clear that this was not the impetus for her to join the Resistance. Additionally, the treatment of the Jews by the French during the Occupation also does not have a role here because of what the Boulloches did. While a more detailed overview might not been amiss, Kaiser does refer to the book Vichy France and the Jews, making it clear that it is the place to go to track down more information. The only way he could have been clearer would have been to say \u2013 go buy it now. (Though I have to wonder why a David Irving book is in the source listing).\tIn short, while this book could have more depth, Kaiser\u2019s writing style is enjoyable enough (regardless of the verb issue) that it should spark a wider interest in the reader in regards to France under Occupation."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate", "userReview": "\"Courage is more exhilarating than fear an in the long run it is easier. We do not have to become heroes overnight. Just one step at a time.\" Eleanor Roosevelt.This is the story of the Boulloche family, an highly educated uppermiddle class French family who had a deep sense of patriotism. The Father Jacques was the Director of Highways, his wife Helene and their eldest Robert an Inspector and Minister of Finance and the three younger children Andre 24 when the war broke out, Jacqueline who was 20 and their younger sister Christiane who was 16 at the start of the war. Andre became involved and very active in the Resistance soon after France was occupied. He was not an ideologue as many of those in the Resistance were, he had a deep ingrained feeling of regard for his country and a need to take action against his country's enemy and occupiers, Nazi Germany.The parents and the eldest son Robert felt that the best way to serve France was to do their jobs and while they did quietly assist others and were aware at some level of what the younger children were doing their was never any real family discussion of it.The life of anyone in the Resistance was generally very short as there were many who to curry favors with their occupiers were only to glad to report any suspects to the Nazis. Few lasted longer than 6 months. Andre with others coordinated Resistance activities, and recuited his younger sisters to run guns, transport radio equipment, and collect reports from various Resistance members that could be relayed to Britain. Andre survived a very long time for people in his position but was eventually betrayed in 1944 and was shot and arrested by the Gestapo. As was typical of Nazi policy his parents and eldest brother were also arrested, his mother tortured and all of them were sent to various concentration camps. None betrayed the youngest sisters who continued to work in the Resistance through the final liberation of France.It is an amazing family story and Andre, Jacqueline and Christiane would continue in life to serve their country and the citizens of France through their activism.We often imagine how we might behave if our country was truly at risk, would we risk life and family to serve? It seems that effective courage is a quiet thing, there is no bluster to it as some might believe because of the books and films that make spies and Resistance fighters look like rugged uber macho figures. The most successful were ordinary and inconspicuous men and women who quietly and methodically went about the job of resistance. These people are much like the military soldiers who often do the most astounding things under fire, it is the quiet men who often exhibit the most courage and are willing to risk the most.Very moving story of a family whose moral courage was ingrained in their beliefs."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean", "userReview": "This is the exciting story of Jacques and Helene Boulloche and their four children Robert, Andre, Christiane and Jacqueline. Kaiser\u2019s uncle was billeted with the Boulloche family in Paris when he was in the U.S. Army in 1944. The story starts in 1939, and follows the Boulloche family, who were prosperous Parisians, throughout WWII. The book covers each of the family member\u2019s roles in the French Resistance throughout the War. The book reads like an action packed thriller as it follows each member of the family in risking death to impede the Nazi war effort. The French Resistance played a vital role in the War. Theirs is the \u201cCourage\u201d in Kaiser\u2019s title; the greatest cost fell on the family members. The parents and eldest son Robert were arrested and deported on the last train to Germany near the end of the war and were sent on to the camps. The rest of the family continued to fight on.The book is beautifully written, meticulously researched and reads like a thriller. Interviews included Francois Delattre, the former French Ambassador to the United States and current French Ambassador to the United Nations. He is the great nephew of Andre Boulloche. The book is a mixture of history, biography and memoir. The author manages to bring the French Resistance to life. When I finished the book I asked myself \u201cCould I ever be that courageous?\u201d I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. The author narrates his own book."}, {"userName": "Randy Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11075638-randy-johnson", "userReview": "I broke my rule against audiobooks read by the author when I bought this book. It's a good rule. But despite the spotty narration, this is a solid book about the French Resistance, what they did and how they survived - or, more often, didn't. The focus is on the members of a single Parisian family, some of whom joined the Resistance, while others did not. Accordingly, scope is somewhat limited by structure, but it's definitely a worthwhile read if the subject interests you."}, {"userName": "Olivia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1320825-olivia", "userReview": "2.5 stars.

For instance, my husband once asked a French friend how the American Revolution is taught in France. His response was \"you could not have done it without us.\" At first we thought his answer to be humorous, but Layfayette, Rochambeau ,as well as the financial backing, were instrumental in the victory and therefore our friend's response was not totally incorrect. The French also give great credence to the role of the French Resisitance in World War II. American history touches on the positive aspects of this movement, but I am not sure we have documented their level of assistance. I am very happy that Charles Kaiser told the true story of Boulloche family and their part in the history of World War II.

I would have given it 5 stars, but in the Afterword the author states that American citizens at home never had to risk anything the way the French did.

It is not written as a romantic adventure, as portrayed in some films, and you realise the fear of people living every day in an occupied country. This is probably the reason so many did not resist and collaborated, even if it was just by meekly doing what the Germans ordered without question. There is a lot of information in this book that is generally unknown, such as 50,000 resistance fighters being deported to Germany, which makes you realise how many in total there must have been fighting surreptitiously against the occupiers.

Of course we studied it in high school. Everybody has read The Diary of Anne Frank and the current generation has read The Book Thief. When I was twenty one I read the entire Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and over the years I have watched various movies from Bridge on the River Kwai to The Great Escape to The Guns of Navarrone. I even had the privilege of hearing the 80 year old Elie Wiesel at the Chautauqua Institute speak about his experiences in German concentration camps during the war. I reread my purchased autographed copy of Night between his two talks (so I could save a good seat). I grew up in a Brooklyn neighborhood where some of my friend's parents had visible tattooed numbers on their arms as evidence of their war experiences. My father was a mine sweeper in the Pacific and survived two sinking ships, pulling one to shore and earning a medal for saving the Captain's life. (My dad died less than twenty years later from a weak heart - the after effects of malaria and chain smoking). So even though, in a way, I grew up surrounded by the war, in reality, my knowledge is limited. When I began reading The Cost of Courage by former New York Times reporter Charles Kaiser, it was like reading a science fiction novel full of fantasy. Although I knew about the French Resistance, I didn't know the particulars as retold by the author. Here is the down and dirty side of the French occupation by the Germans, not a story coached in politically correct descriptions, but an honest accounting of what happened from the eyes of the people involved. Just as my father rarely spoke of the war (and never to me), these folks were tight lipped as well. The horrors they experienced remained a taboo subject. Luckily Kaiser was able to convince them to share their memories as members of the Maquis, a tale which will all-to-soon be lost resulting in a world ignorant of the nitty gritty details of that era - a time which needs to be chronicled if only to allow us to understand how our past is effecting the future. Nobody else could have written this book. Charles' Uncle Henry Kaiser was an American Lieutenant who was invited to stay at the Boulloche home in Paris in 1944 after the Liberation of Paris and the return of Charles de Gaulle. Over the year he remained, Henry head the stories of Christiane, Jacqueline, and Andre and their experiences as a part of the French Resistance, which he later conveyed with a dramatic flair to his young nephew. Charles Kaiser first visited the Boulloche family in 1962 when he was eleven and over the years was able to frequent their gatherings. He considered the Boulloches his \"French cousins\" and became an \"adopted\" member of their extended family. Charles noticed that the past adventures relayed by his uncle were never mentioned. It is not surprising that after the senseless death of their parents (Jacques and Helene, and their older brother Robert) and the end of the war, the surviving three siblings married and started life anew, leaving the horrors of the war behind. Finally, nearing the end of the century, Charles was able to convince Christiane, the only surviving sibling, that if her tale was not told the history would be lost to future generations. It would simply disappear if she failed to record it. For her it was a sense of obligation, so, at the age of 71, she began the emotionally difficult task of transcribing her experiences in a forty five page manuscript for her children and grand kids to read. Charles used this memoir, completed in 1999, as a starting point. He spent two and a half years in France researching and interviewing key players in the drama. This is a book which was fifty years in the making, beginning with the \"stories\" as retold by his uncle on up through to 2015 when this tome was finally published. Charles, a journalist, relates the specifics of the European War from the rise of Hitler and the reactions of England and France to the German invasion of France to the Battle of Normandy where the allies began defeating the Germans to the final retaking of Paris continuing up until the end of the war. Within this historical background is the story of the French Resistance and the role the Bollouche siblings played in bringing down the Nazis. This book takes a straightforward unapologetic view of the reactions of the French citizens, especially the Parisians, to the German occupation. If this topic intrigues you there is also the 1969 documentary - The Sorrow and the Pity - which explores European life during this era. Despite the revealed depictions fraught with tragedy (all man made), there are also moments of success and ultimate victory. Kaiser rounds out this book with details about the postwar lives of the Boulloches and includes a list of characters, acknowledgements, notes, a bibliography, and an index along with an afterward and preface. The included photographs were a nice touch.The author writes the story as if we are there and life is unfolding as we read. This telling in the present tense might be jarring for folks who would rather read about the past and not feel as if they were reliving events as they happened. It is, however, an effective tool to immerse the reader into the story to get a touch of the gut wrenching horror felt by the participants. In any case, while fascinating and well written, this is not an easy book to get through simply because there is just too much to take in. Just as when I read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, I concede that even if I reread it a second time, I still would not be able to retain all the information. Yet, I perceive its essence and that is good enough for me. God bless Christiane, Jacqueline, and Andre (and their cohorts) for their fearless work on behalf of the French nation as well as the rest of the world. Thank you!
