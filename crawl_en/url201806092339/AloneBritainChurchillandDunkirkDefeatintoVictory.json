Behind them gather a group of shattered states and bludgeoned races, the Czechs, the Poles, the Norwegians, the Danes, the Dutch, the Belgians--upon all of whom the long night of barbarism will descend unbroken by even a star of hope, unless we conquer--as conquer we must--as conquer we shall.\u201d----Winston Churchill\nWinston Churchill addressing the nation, nay the world, he was trying to save.If you ever feel the need to be inspired about humanity again, take the time to read or listen to the wartime speeches of Winston Churchill. He was not only a gifted writer, but a brilliant orator. He could move even his most ardent enemies to tears. I can\u2019t imagine the world would be the place it is today if Churchill had not become Prime Minister of Great Britain at one of the most critical eras in the history of the World. There were many moments, especially during the early part of the war, when he took the fears of his whole nation on his back and molded that fear into an unshakeable resolve. \u201dWe shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender and if, which I do not for the moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, will carry on the struggle until in God's good time the New World with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and liberation of the Old.\u201d----Winston ChurchillMichael Korda was a young boy of privilege during WW2. The actress Merle Oberon was his aunt. The great director and producer Alexander Korda was his uncle. His father was an art director in the movies, and his mother was an actress. When the war started coming to the shores of England, the Kordas were in America making movies, like That Hamilton Woman (1941), as propaganda films to raise morale in England. There is no better way to bring a tear to the eye of an Englishman than to evoke the name of Horatio Nelson. The movie, which stars Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, is actually really good, so do watch it if you get a chance. Korda\u2019s mother always felt guilty that they did not suffer in London with the rest of their friends, as if avoiding the pain and danger was somehow shirking the duty of her heritage. A few years ago, I read this diary of a German soldier, and he wrote about how the Germans had such a hard time catching up with the French because they were fleeing like rabbits in front of them, but they knew instantly when they hit the British line. They weren\u2019t running. They were there to fight. The blitzkrieg was blowing through countries within days that should have taken months. The French had one of the largest standing armies in the world, and the Germans were going through it like tinfoil. \u201dIt was not for lack of brave officers and soldiers that the French Army was collapsing; it was more because of the fatal strategic misjudgment, paralysis of will, helpless pessimism, and political intrigue at the top, combined with certain areas in which the French armed forces were poorly equipped for a modern war, especially an inadequate and obsolete air force.\u201d There was the lure of Paris, a mere 30 miles in their rear where their beautiful girlfriends/wives, good food, and bottles of wine were waiting for them. Korda commented that the French soldiers also felt like they were doing all the dying for the British. This bothers me given the fact that these French soldiers were defending their own soil. If that was their attitude, I can see why morale was an issue. \nI can only imagine how terrifying it must have been to see a division of Panzer tanks coming down the hill towards me.There were opportunities. The German tank blitzkrieg was running so far ahead of the German foot soldiers that some organization on the part of the French could have punched holes in the German line and cut the tanks off from their support and inflicted some defeats on an army that was starting to feel unbeatable. When I watch football and the defense is blitzing the quarterback, I always think about the opportunities that overcommitment from the defense has for a steely nerved quarterback who can hang in the pocket long enough to find those open receivers. The French needed that one guy who could provide the leadership to achieve victory out of defeat. Meanwhile, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) were doing all they could to slow the Germans long enough to find a way back to England. No one had expected the French army to be crushed so easily. As the BEF slowly compressed backwards onto the beaches of Dunkirk, the situation was dire; in fact, if the Germans managed to capture the British Army, the war would most certainly be over. The appeasers in the British government would gain the power to negotiate a peace settlement, which would have been dire for France, but would have most certainly gutted the British of their pride and joy...the navy. Hitler would have wanted that glittering array of ships.Who would have stood in the way of Adolf Hitler? The title of this book is apt\u2026Alone; that is the situation that Britain found herself in, with the flower of her army trapped on a beach a mere thirty miles from the white cliffs of Dover. \n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen Dunkirk (2017) directed by Christopher Nolan, please do so. There are scenes in that movie that are going to haunt me for the rest of my life. It is simply brilliant. The quiet, the building tension, the desperation, and the moments of true heroics are just so splendidly balanced to leave the viewer completely emotionally wrung out by the ending credits. I\u2019ve always been emotional about Dunkirk because I feel it is quite possibly the grandest moment in world history. When the call is made to the British civilians to go get their boys off the beaches of Dunkirk, 850 crafts, a flotilla of shallow draft boats that could reach the beach, were launched. Everything that floats.I can only image what it must have looked like to see those tiny boats appearing on the horizon. They must have looked so fragile bobbing out on that big ocean. They helped save 198,000 British soldiers and 140,000 French soldiers.\nThe Little Boats of Dunkirk.Korda will take you through it all, step by step. You will experience Churchill\u2019s battles in Parliament and the rearguard action of those who slowed the German advance to give the men on Dunkirk beach a chance. The book is loaded with photographs, sprinkled throughout the text the way I like them best. Korda will also show you the important, baffling moment when Adolf Hitler... blinks... that allows Britain the slenderest of hopes of fighting on. They had to hold on until the New World could once again come and save the Old World.

This is a two layered story.......one about Dunkirk coupled with a partial autobiography about Korda's family during this very tense time in Britain. The author's father and uncles, Hungarian by birth, were in the top echelon of the film industry and were friends with the Churchill government which added a bit of color to their lives and to the book.Lots of pictures of everyone from Rommel to Merle Oberon (the author's aunt by marriage) and maps of the movement of the German army as they slowly caught the BEF and French armies in a pincer movement which forced them to retreat until the sea was at their back. Over a million soldiers were trapped on the beaches under constant fire from German troops and the Luftwaffe. How to save the BEF was probably one of the hardest decisions that had to be made by the British and their solution was, to say the least, unusual.........the use of the \"little boats\", everything from ferries to privately owned yachts were gathered at Dover from all over the island and, accompanied by a limited number military ships, they set out for Dunkirk to rescue the trapped troops. It certainly sounded like an impossible task but instead turned a disaster into a victory. The author includes many personal stories of the rescuers/survivors which may be one of the reasons that the story is so appealing. There is even a connection with the ill-fated Titanic!I highly recommend this book, even if you have made a study of the Dunkirk experience. Fascinating."}, {"userName": "Sean Smart", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5866059-sean-smart", "userReview": "A good introduction to the Dunkirk story and the fall of France in 1940 and very well illustrated but I found some errors and was not too impressed perhaps because it was written with an American audience in mind."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean", "userReview": "So much has been written about Churchill. Historians and authors are challenged to present information differently. Recently there have been several books published about Churchill.Michael Korda combines military history and memoirs in a unique manner to tell of the beginning of World War Two, the fall of France and the miracle of Dunkirk. Korda has stories within stories of tragedies and heroic acts. Korda states the French Army collapsed because of fatal strategic misjudgments, paralysis of will, helpless pessimism, political intrigue and lack of leadership. The author reminds us that the British had a courageous, canny, inspirational leader in Winston S. Churchill. The book is well written and researched. This is definitely a British story. I enjoyed that the author included his family\u2019s story into the mix of civilian stories. The story\u2019s main thrust is of the British Expeditionary Forces retreating from the Nazi Blitzkrieg that leveled Belgium then turned toward Paris. Korda focused on the key players of Chamberlain, Churchill, Hitler and Admiral Bertram Ramsey. If you are interested in Churchill or World War II, you will enjoy this book.I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. The book is thirteen hours long. John Lee does an excellent job narrating the book. John Lee is one of my favorite narrators. Lee has won multiple Earphone Awards. In 2009 he won the Golden Voice Award and he has won a number of Audies in different genre over the years."}, {"userName": "Scott Bruun", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7213194-scott-bruun", "userReview": "There\u2019s a ton (literally) of good Churchill biographies. The problem is that his life was so enormously full and important, traditional biographies must necessarily give single events or small time periods within his life briefer treatment than they deserve. The crowded events of May 1940 and Dunkirk are among those. Thankfully, two recent movies (Dunkirk and The Darkest Hour) have brought deeper public attention and interest to that critical time. \u201cAlone,\u201d by Michael Korda, does an excellent job of providing the deeper story, including detail around the build-up, actual events and strategic implications of the Dunkirk evacuation. The book is comprehensive but still very readable. It flows steadily and keeps the reader engaged. Like any good history, Alone blends the big-picture with individual human stories -- from homes in England and battlefields in Holland and Belgium, to a massively complicated evacuation of over 300,000 soldiers from a beach in France. Yet for all of it, the one theme that can\u2019t help but emerge from the book is the singular courage of Winston Churchill. A truly amazing human yet not without his fair-share of human flaws and contradictions. Churchill himself wrote that courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees all others. Thank goodness for Churchill\u2019s courage, for the world even today would look much different without it. Alone tells that story well."}, {"userName": "Peter Mcloughlin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-mcloughlin", "userReview": "This is both a history of Britain's most dire moments in the early part of WWII and a personal memoir. It is a tale of hope coming in desperate times when evil seemed about to triumph. It has all the elements of a great drama yet it really happened. Britain really did hold out against the enveloping tyranny surrounding them. The good guys actually saved themselves through sheer tenacity. No wonder it is burnt into British consciousness. it is a great story."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen", "userReview": "Judging by most World War 2 histories, the war only heats up once Hitler's rapid takeover of northern and western Europe is accomplished in the spring of 1940, and England is left facing a continent controlled by two execrable men and Mussolini. The fall of the low countries and the fighting retreat of the Allied army happen so quickly that they're dispatched almost as a prologue to the greater drama. Alone takes that prologue as its subject, opening at Munich and moving quickly to the invasion of Poland and the state of war which followed. Readers witness stiff desire not to fight again quickly replaced by a mixture of chivalrous indignation and less chivalrous resignation, as England again dispatches her army to Europe to check the German advance, standing alongside the even more resigned French. Here too are chronicled the desperate struggles by the Dutch and Belgian armies, who though colossally outmatched, refuse to yield . The finish, of course, is the great drama of Dunkirk, where the men of the British expeditionary force are surrounded by the German advance, but escape to safety by means of a fleet of civilian ships, a brilliant of example of England expecting every man to do his duty -- even men out of uniform. Korda notes that the triumphant escape of Dunkirk sometimes overshadows the sheer awfulness of getting there and enduring it: some regiments lost as many as two-thirds of their men, and the beach itself was a spectacle from Dante, filled with burning debris, scattered bodies, and the stench of both. Alone is a personal history as well, as a very young Michael Korda was just old enough to realize something bad was happening; the Korda family's involvement in British and later American film industry adds an interesting flair to a more familiar subject. Korda strikes a good balance between narrative and detail, and includes a generous amount of in-text illustrations of personalities and movements.

A good, popular history that presents no great surprises or new insight. I thought the best sections were the ones dealing with individual relationships in the backroom political life; and the all too infrequent stories related to the author's own family's place in the story. In fact, I really think the author wrote the wrong book. What would have been much more interesting, and which has not been much covered, would have been the story on how three Central European brothers established themselves in a still very class bound country. And not only established themselves, but became powerful in their own right, with connections in all the right places both in England and the United States."}, {"userName": "Dell Hilton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22891221-dell-hilton", "userReview": "Truly enlightening. Michael Korda has done a great job in writing this history of a pivotal time in the history not only of England and WWII, but also of the world."}, {"userName": "Nestor Rychtyckyj", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15762746-nestor-rychtyckyj", "userReview": "2017 was definitely the year to get a deeper understanding of the momentous events that took place in Europe in the early stages of World War II. Two excellent movies (Dunkirk and Darkest Hour) have already shown this on the big screen and this new book by Michael Korda continues this trend.Michael Korda has a unique perspective as he was a 7-year old child living in the UK during this time. The book is strengthened with his personal memories and observations of the time when many thought that England would soon be surrendering to Germany. Winston Churchill of course plays the major role here, but Korda skillfully weaves many different story lines into the narrative including the perspectives of Hitler and his generals, the French, Belgians and Dutch as well as the the British. We all know how the story ends but this 462-page book fills in the blanks that \"Dunkirk\" and \"Darkest Hour\" could not cover.An interesting and quite disturbing episode that is not discussed much anymore was a program by the British government to remove children from their parents and send them away to rural areas or even to Canada was certainly not the proudest moment for Churchill, but desperate times lead to desperate and indefensible measures. This was demonstrated again and again including the internment of Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor.This is an excellent book and highly recommended to anybody looking for more details about the time the England stood alone against Hitler."}, {"userName": "Nathaniel", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-nathaniel", "userReview": "For the most part, I didn't really understand the point of this book. It's a recounting of the early years of World War II, from just before the war to the fall of France, told from the perspective of the British with a few personal notes by the author about what his father (a designer for major films of the time) was up to. In this regard, it felt very generic. Sort of like a (very) diluted version of The Guns of August.There were two aspects that I found very interesting, but they got very little play. One was about the Hungarian immigrant community. I lived in Hungary for two years and I speak Hungarian, so I've got a personal interest in that. The author's family was Hungarian--and this was mentioned often--but I really wanted to hear more about their background and about the Hungarian community in general. I can see why that wasn't included--everyone forgets about Hungary--but I would have liked to hear some more.Another one was, for lack of a better word, the socio-psychological explanation of the Dunkirk mythos. Example:King George VI spoke for the whole nation when he wrote to his mother Queen Mary after the fall of France, \"Personally, I feel happier now that we have no allies to be polite to and to pamper.\" Dunkirk is not unrelated to the emotions of those who demanded \"Brexit,\" the British exit from the European Union in 2016. There was a national sense of relief in 1940 at leaving the Continent and withdrawing behind the White Cliffs of Dover.So, yeah: that's really interesting. Tell me more about the particular spirit of the English and how it relates to Dunkirk and Brexit and (ideally) much more beyond that. Well, not so much. There were only a few words on that subject at the very end.A history book has to do something something to be really interesting. There are lots of options:- overturn a popular narrative everyone thought was true- show a famous event or person from a new perspective that changes how we see them / it- show how a non-famous event / person actually had a much greater impact than we thought- use the historical narrative to advance an interesting thesis about science, religion, philosophy, etc.I don't even know which this book was trying to shoot for. It just seemed like a recounting of a familiar story with slightly more detail.If I learned anything from reading it, it was the reminder that all stories are wrong. There's a famous quote from statistics / math: \"All models are wrong, but some are useful.\" Similar idea applies here. No matter what you were taught in school, as far as history goes, it was wrong. If you look closer, you will find that what you were taught was a simplified, often moralistic version of what actually happened. Studying World War 2 in the late 20th century and early 21st, you get the impression that the Germans invaded France, the French collapsed, the British got pushed back to Dunkirk, and then thousands of small boats rescued them. But there was actually a lot of fighting before the French collapsed, and their defeat didn't seem a foregone conclusion at the time. Moreover, most of the British forces were evacuated by destroyers, not small boats, and many tens of thousands of French soldiers were also evacuated. At this point, I don't really know what history is. With science, the \"all models are wrong, some are useful\" is self-explanatory. If you ignore wind resistance in a physics problem, you're wrong in a technical sense, but you can probably still make predictions that are accurate enough in a practical sense. There aren't really any deep, philosophical quandaries here. You can certainly go off in that direction if you feel so inclined, and read The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, but--while you're waiting for total enlightenment about the nature of truth in a world where every model we have of the universe is wrong--there are no doubts that the abstractions are useful.But it's not at all clear that historical narratives (which are also models / abstractions) are useful in the same kind of way that physics models are. Of course the idea of total historical ignorance sounds bad. The idea of never having heard of World War 2 sounds repugnant, and recent stories that Millennials don't know what the Holocaust is show that we're all pretty secure in our assumptions that we should know something about history.But is that actually a good assumption? The thing is that with physics models there is such a thing as \"good enough\". That's because most physical systems that we're interested in are relatively simple. If you want to know how much bungie cord to use before jumping off a bridge, you are dealing with a simple (i.e. non-chaotic) system where you don't need to be accurate to the milimeter (because you're going to want a bigger safety cushion than that) and where small changes in your answer will equate to small changes in the actual results. But historical systems are chaotic and fractal. Which is to say: no matter how closely you look at historical events, the level of complexity seems pretty constant. It's very, very hard to understand precisely one person's worldview and predict their actions. It doesn't seem obviously more or less difficult to understand an entire nation's worldview and predict its actions. So, in physics, it's pretty easy to see that ignoring wind resistance is (in most cases) just fine and ignoring gravity is (in most cases) not acceptable. But we have no such useful guideposts in history. If we want to understand the past and/or have some foresight for the future, there's no useful benchmark for how much approximation is acceptable. Which is why we make tremendous strides in applied physics--from air travel to microchip design--year over year and in history we can't even settle the most basic and fundamental questions. Do \"great men\" influence history? Or are they just the randomly-selected chaff that rises to the top of the turbulent stream of history that is governed by deeper and more abstract forces? Did Karl Marx create something singular and unreproducible with the Communist Manifesto that changed the whole course of the 20th century, or was someone like Karl Marx and something like Marxism basically inevitable given all that had come before? There are imponderable questions in physics, too. Have fun with Spooky Action at a Distance: The Phenomenon That Reimagines Space and Time\u2014and What It Means for Black Holes, the Big Bang, and Theories of Everything, for example. But physics remains useful to us in quantitative, practical ways regardless.I'm not sure if history does. Which seems to make it more like philosophy and literature than like engineering or medicine."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7028366-emily", "userReview": "In all the books that I have read about WWII and even in the college course I took on WWII left out much of the non-American version of the war. Having that background made Alone very cool. It was nice to see the war from the perspective of an English citizen. Although Micahel Korda was very young when he experienced the war, the book being very well researched, he also mentions much of what he and his family were experiencing. His family were in the movie and theater businesses so international and inter-European travel were frequent occurrences and kept them up to date on most prewar activities. Korda's book starts with the appeasement process. The world had just been at word not twenty years earlier, so even though Germany was breaking the disarmament terms of the Treaty of Versailles, other countries were bending over backwards not to get involved in another war. As appeasement dragged on through the invasions of the Sudetenland and up through Poland, Korda recounts the tepid British response and slow rearmament. The French, counting on the Brits to be their allies, were also woefully underprepared for the onslaught brought by the German invasion of Belgium and France. By the end the first offensive, the Belgians were all but disbanded, the French were falling apart, and the British were being cornered in Dunkirk, as the ports at Calais and Boulogne had already fallen. General Ramsey had the forethought to assemble a seafaring rescue operation even before the BEF thought it would be necessary. Finally, when pushed to the English Channel the BEF retreated via the beach at Dunkirk.Rather than glamorize the retreat, as many are prone to today, Korda tells the gritty tale of soldiers lined up on beaches, dying of thirst, getting shelled consistantly, and being carted off haphazardly by a fleet of Naval and civilian forces. Nothing about the evacuation was glamorous and Alone did a wonderful job of summing up Operation Dynamo and it's lasting effect on the war."}, {"userName": "Anne Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52107849-anne-morgan", "userReview": "Michael Korda's new book Alone: Britain, Churchill, and Dunkirk: Defeat into Victory examines the the early days of World War II. Alone covers a lot of events, mostly from the British point of view but also French and German: Chamberlain's failed appeasement policy, France and England reluctantly being drawn back into war, Churchill becoming Prime Minister, Germany rewriting the use of tanks in warfare, conflicting personalities and agendas among allied generals. All leading up to the evacuation of over 300,000 English and French troops from the beach of Dunkirk, late May 1940. Scattered throughout the researched history are personal stories and a bit of family history as Korda reflects on his own memories as a 6 year old in a wealthy family of actors and movie makers.Based on the book blurb for Alone, I had high hopes this would be a World War II history along the lines of Lynne Olson's Last Hope Island- meticulously researched, written with vivid detail and an eye for making individuals and their experiences leap off the page and into your mind. Alone is certainly well researched. I now have a much better understanding of the creation and purpose of the famed French Maginot Line after reading the early part of Alone. The research into the French and British military leaders, their different approaches, their conflicts among themselves, and the difficulties they had in communicating with each other (not only with radios, and phones, but personal dislikes that often meant one man in charge wasn't on speaking terms with another) was well done and gave you a sense of what the chaos on the ground must have been like. How they accomplished any successes with so many personal clashes going on is (as is the case in most military histories I've read recently) amazing.The Korda family moments interspersed within Alone were occasionally interesting, but generally felt like they belonged in a separate book. Instead of showing what life on the home front was normally like, more often than not they showed how money could soften difficulties. Korda frequently mentions how his uncle Alex worked with Churchill and the government to make his (then current) movies into subtle propaganda designed to gain the sympathy and support of the United States. The Thief of Baghdad and That Hamilton Woman were eventually made in the US to seem like 'regular' big budget Hollywood movies instead of British propaganda. But the reader never gets an idea of what that meant, or if it worked- which would have made me much more interested in it. The actual telling of the evacuation from Dunkirk only takes place in the last 100 or so pages of Alone and often seemed scattered and disorienting. I'm sure that this is what the people on the ground experienced at the time, but I was hoping for a more coherent and understandable account to this interesting and unique moment in history.Overall I was disappointed in Alone. Instead of being a vivid account of a slice of history it was often repetitive, and choppily written. Personal family stories didn't blend in to give us a better feeling for the time but mostly jarred the reader from the military narrative. Military leaders and personalities blended together, making it hard to remember who was who (often even what side they were on) and even Winston Churchill didn't spring to life here. The evacuation story itself almost seemed like an afterthought, with a few good, clear moments. People who have seen Chris Nolan's 2017 movie Dunkirk will recognize the inspiration for the \"sea\" story of The Moonstone, and find the original story ( in my opinion) even more interesting and gripping- one of the few moments I could say that about Alone.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest reviewFor my full review, go to:https://bookwyrmreader.blogspot.com/2..."}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10243959-ben", "userReview": "For those who saw the recent movie \"Dunkirk\" and thought that it was exciting, I recommend that you read \" Alone\" by Michael Korda. I saw that movie and was appalled at the simplified, dumbed-down portrayal of what occurred there. There was very little sense of the disaster that had befallen the allied armies and the horrifying conditions of the beaches of Dunkirk. The movie showed some little straffing and bombing , not the almost constant German attacks , and gave no information as to what had happened to put the Brisish forces in such a dire situation. The movie was, as most movies are these days, a mosh-mash of SFX, sketchy history, juvenile writing and hammy acting.This book is a necessary antidote to that.\"Alone\" by Michael Korda, is a well-written, easily accessible history that covers the events leading to the beginning of the war, the speed and devasting power of the German army on the ground and in the air and the tenacious , though doomed, efforts of the allies to stop their advance. The book is filled with personal stories of both General's and common and common soldiers, including the famously idiosyncratic British trait of coolness under pressure ( a soldier reading a Gertrude Stein novel in a ditch while being shelled is one I recall). Churchill, often idolized , is in the book is shown as a master politician, cheerleader, negotiator and fiddler with the General Staff's war plans ( a trait he shared with Hitler, by the way, though not to Hitler's extent.) Churchill maneuvers politically in Paliament to keep Britian' s morale up even as the army retreats. He is shown as every bit the tenacious bull dog, a trait shared with his fighting men. Truly a man who was where he had to be , when he had to be.But this is not a political book. Nor is it a military history. It is a popular history written to be enjoyed by everyone with an interest in what, why and how Dunkirk came about and why it was so important to the long war ahead. There are plenty of picutures and maps for the reader. Mr. Korda also inserts brief , but interesting vignettes of his family life . He is a seven year old son of a family of Hungarian background all of who were involved in the movie industry . He uncle, Alexander, was a director who created films in Britain and the US , not to mention France and Germany before the war. An interesting aside was that the Korda family gave financial assaisstance to Churchill when during his \"out\" years by finding movie script jobs for him, to be rewarded while he was PM by his, or the British film board, financing some Hollywood movies / pro- British, of course. Korda's production company was also used by British secret agents as a front from which they worked to speed US involve the into the war.

It\u2019s an excellent history of Hitler\u2019s movements, plans and exceedingly good luck at the beginning of the war and the pitiful defense Poland, Belgium and the French were able to put up. Only the Dutch made them pay for every acre of ground secured.Dunkirk was an absolute miracle well thought out, planned and prepared for. Hundreds and hundreds of small civilian boats rushing to the rescue of the British and French forces as Hitler\u2019s army squeezed them to almost destruction. 400,000 troops were saved, a 160,000 of them French. And most importantly, it convinced Churchill England could win alone if necessary.The two mistakes Hitler made that lost him a victory at Dunkirk were real failures in judgement and refusal to listen to his military, something he would do again and again throughout the war.First, the Panzer tank divisions were a new way of warfare and he (nor his staff) was convinced of the efficacy. They wanted them to move slowly so the infantry could keep up while the Panzer commanders found by moving quickly it paralyzed the enemy who had nothing in the way of weaponry to stop them. Allied troops fled away from their advance leaving their weapons behind joining the throngs of refugees filling the highways attempting to escape their advance.Finally Hitler put his foot down ordering them to stop for several days for \u201cservicing\u201d just like the cavalry had to rest their horses even though the tank commanders had told him the German troops serviced them every night before going to bed. This several day delay allowed the French and British to retreat to Dunkirk and begin there escape.The second mistake was in deciding to first defeat the French before turning his attention to England. Once again this provided the British time to execute and escape plan.Finally what convinced Churchill of British success is summed up in the following sentence:\u201cSo long as the fight was at sea or in the air, Britain still had a chance to survive, and no German invasion was likely to succeed without German command of the sea and air over the channel.\u201dHis prediction proved correct though the entrance by the United States certainly helped. But reading this book, I am convinced had we never entered the war the British would have defeated Germany simply by the act of will.A good lesson for us all against our enemies."}, {"userName": "Bob Mobley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4040326-bob-mobley", "userReview": "Michael Korda\u2019s excellent look at the history of World War II, leading up to the Dunkirk evacuation, is well worth reading. Korda is a gifted author, as well as the former Editor-in-Chief of Simon, Schuster. He understands the power of language, and how to write in a style that is engaging, drawing you into the story he is telling, holding your interest and making it an exciting journey. In his story of Dunkirk, Alone, Korda combines the chronicles of the outbreak of the Second World War, and the great events leading to Dunkirk, with a fascinating look inside his own rich family stories. Alone is indeed a very moving book, bringing to life world leaders and generals, and the ordinary citizens who fought on both sides of the war. Korda relates what happened and why it occurred in a manner that builds to an amazing outcome, which supports his point that Dunkirk may well have been the pivotal turning point in World War II. It was Dunkirk that showed the Germans and the rest of the world that the British were not going to roll over like the French, and surrender, but instead, would fight to the bitter end. One of the truly amazing outcomes that stands out in Korda\u2019s book, is the manner in which Dunkirk was transformed in one of the greatest defeats the British army has ever endured to becoming an almost legendary victory. The \u201cSpirit of Dunkirk\u201d that was to become engrained in the British consciousness, was set in motion and made possible by Churchill\u2019s mastery of the English language, and the fact that as Prime Minister, he took words to war, and created within the British people, a powerful willingness to sustain themselves and resist the Nazis. Alone is a book that is well worth reading for its lessons in leadership and character. It is interesting to think of Korda\u2019s book in terms of two other events that have taken place recently that have had an enormous influence on viewers. The first is the movie, Dunkirk, and the second is the movie, Darkest Hour. When combined as a retrospective trilogy on this dramatic period of history, great truths and lessons emerge. One of them is clearly that there is no substitute for courageous leadership built on clear values and a strong belief in the Faith that can come from a higher power."}, {"userName": "H.W.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31279642-h-w", "userReview": "This was one of those books the library had on display. It is newly out and popular, so I was lucky to get a copy to check out. Being a student of history, I've been familiar with the general activities that led up to the British evacuation at Dunkirk, but I've always been starved for details. How did the British manage to get all those men out? How many made it? What about the French? Why wasn't the German army able to stop them? Did the small boats really help all that much? This book is well-researched and does a great job of answering those questions. It also, importantly, introduces the politics--domestic and military--that maneuvered Britain into the situation in the first place. Along the way, Michael Korda weaves a compelling narrative with a information-rich but eminently readable style.He manages this by interweaving personal points of view into the story, with his parents and extended family doing their best British best to get on with their business in the midst of warfare. In fact they were almost caught by the battle on the continent (like most well-off families, they were vacationing in France that spring). Another aspect of Korda's success is his storytelling. Every chapter tells a story, and each story hangs on a salient, unexpected fact--for example, the indomitable control Chamberlain had over his party. Whereas we Americans often see him painted as weak, a sop to Hitler, Korda paints the picture of a man so in control he perhaps missed the bigger picture. He also fills in the blanks of what Chamberlain did after he fell from the prime minister's position.more detail here https://wp.me/p4S3cq-qm"}, {"userName": "Grommit", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55582867-grommit", "userReview": "Another Dunkirk book, to accompany the Summer 2017 movie. All three recent titles were well done. This book includes analysis of Chamberlain's success at temporarily appeasing Hitler and the very positive reaction among the Parliament and citizens. Excellent analysis follows of the Chamberlain-Churchill parliamentary maneuvering in response to Hitler's invasions of Finland, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Along the way we benefit from a concise assessment of French military mindset: they did not want war, did not want to invade anyone. This mindset explained the willingness to seek Mussolini's aid in avoiding outright war (oops...wrong guy!) and the Maginot Line (hey...let's build a wall and keep out the bad guys...hmmm...where have I heard that one.) And apparently the French military reputation was earned in the past, but no longer valid. In fact, the author reports many incidents ridiculing the French willingness to cooperate and fight. Another highlight: the clear explanation of how the German invasion plan (through the \"impassable\" Ardennes forest), its planing, revisions, and brilliant execution. This analysis is accompanied by the several explanations for the temporary halt. Of course, we finally get to the actual Dunkirk scenarios: the bitterly defended perimeter accompanied by the armada of little boats (most expertly handled as a collaboration with the British Navy. Some observations might be questioned by other authors, but Korda provides sources."}, {"userName": "Jim Zubricky", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36829-jim-zubricky", "userReview": "After this summer's blockbuster film, \"Dunkirk\", I wanted to read whatever I can get my hands on to know more about the story. One of the books that Amazon pointed me to was this book. I was excited because of the picture of Churchill on the cover, but I thought for sure, this would be a great book. When I started reading the review on Amazon - this this history would be interspersed with family stories - I thought, well... this could be... interesting. And it was. The first half of the book flew by. If you're interested in the British version of how World War II was declared, the Phoney War, the Norway campaign, and how Churchill became PM -- Read this book! You will not be disappointed. If the book ended here, I would give it 5 stars - easily.Once the main story of the book began - the Fall of France and the BEF evacuation at Dunkirk - the text took on a really sluggish, haltingly pace that does not match the first half of the book. In fact, you might be able to argue that there are two separate works trying to be stitched together. The second half was okay. Honestly, I found Walter Lord's work on Dunkirk was a bit more informative.

Korda writes with great clarity and offers sound insights. I've read three of his other book - his excellent biographies of T.E. Lawrence and Robert E. Lee and his history of the Battle of Britain - and they have all been very worthwhile. His account of Dunkirk, while not ignoring the mythic small boat aspects, give great credit to the Royal Navy and the superb planning and foresight of Admiral Ramsey and does not shy away from the less heroic aspects of the story, e.g. the swamping of small boats by panicked soldiers.Korda comes from a fascinating family of movies producers, actresses, and art directors, etc. and his memories of his family are as compelling as his larger theme.

Very readable. The story of the efforts to bring the soldiers back to England and the role of the little boats remains inspiring no matter how many times told. I was interested to learn that Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsey started to develop a plan to bring the soldiers back to England if required only five days after the German attack. It started with an ad in the Times of an Admiralty order for all owners of boats between 30ft and 100ft in length to send particulars within 14 days.I was surprised that of the about 140,000 French soldiers taken to England only 3,000 would eventually choose to join de Gaulle's Free French Forces. The rest were repatriated to France and mostly ended up in German prisoner of war camps for the remainder of the war. These figures are recited twice within a few pages.

The chatty, almost tabloid tone of parts of the book (for example, the mistresses of the two French PMs hated each other and thwarted war efforts) keeps the stories moving. I would have liked a little more info on what happened at Dunkirk-- were there British troops left there? Our understanding of the war, especially in Europe, is colored perhaps too strongly by Churchill's books.

If you've seen the movie about Dunkirk, this book will provide a somewhat different account of what actually happened there. I most enjoyed the author's personal account of what he remembers from the age of 6, and that of his famous and connected film family. I wish there would have been more on that. The book is well written as the author is a noted historian. My takeaway is that war is a mess, it's ugly, and oftentimes leaders are clueless. The relationship between France and England was never great and the cultural differences manifest themselves it seems forever.
