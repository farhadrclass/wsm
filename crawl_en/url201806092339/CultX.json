He has written a number of dark, obsessive works that are quite terrific. \u201cThief\u201d especially stands out as a work that encapsulates isolation, distance, and feeling like an outsider. It\u2019s poetic prose weaves a silky web around the readers, drawing them in. \u201cCult X\u201d is Nakamura\u2019s latest work, a kind of magnum opus focusing not just on cults, but showing how it feels to be ensnared by a cult\u2019s devious web, where sex, power, isolation, and psychology, render the followers susceptible to many suggestions. Together with a taste of recruitment techniques, the leader\u2019s lectures are set forth throughout the text. I read this with high expectations based on reading \u201cThe Thief,\u201d but it was a difficult book for me to stay interested in, perhaps because of its non-traditional presentation."}, {"userName": "Akylina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11414770-akylina", "userReview": "Seems like 2018 is the year of long, complicated and difficult-to-review books.Full review to come soon."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "Must have think time on this one.

Initial thoughts:1. I think this book destroyed me. 2. I'm normally a 200 page a day kinda girl on my days off. This had me at 50 pages a day because it's so deep.3. I could see this being a book I re-read every year. I could see it having a cult following (no pun intended).4. I impulse bought all of Fuminori's other novels after 150 pages of this book. 5. There's a lot of sexual content? Not really going to touch on that in this review, but if you're not here for it you should know that as of the review copy, there's just a whole lot of sex scenes and graphic detailing of orgies at certain points in the book.Full review:H o l y mackerel.This book is so good that even though I finished it 3 weeks ago, I'm still hoarding it in my room and ruminating over what to put in the review. I don't know how to collect and organize what I feel about this one, in a good way. Cult X is so deep and thoughtful and intricate and just... everything?? I would call it a masterpiece.The problem is, I don't know where to begin with this one. It tells the story of two cults (well, really 3, but I can't get into that without spoiling things, soooo you're just gonna have to read this book), one of which isn't really a cult, and another which is most definitely a cult. And the whole book is just exploring this idea of why people become radicalized and what makes people - regular, ordinary, everyday people - into cult members. Why do people make the decisions they make? That's essentially the exploration.And I loved getting into all of that philosophy. I tend to shy away from deep, philosophical books, I'll admit it. I tend to read a lot of brain-check-out books. But this... This book doesn't hold back. It has entire lectures from the fictitious cult leaders, exploring the fundamental similarities between Buddhism and like, astrophysics. And although that may sound intimidating or boring, it's neither. It makes for one of the most interesting books I've read this year. I also really enjoyed the essential arguments of this book. One of the topics brought up was whether humans really act based on logic or emotion; logos vs pathos. And even a full three weeks later, I still find myself thinking: which one is it? When I'm talking politics with people who don't side with me, for example, what's driving our opinions--logic or emotions? And it keeps drawing me back to Cult X. As soon as I finished this book, I wanted to read it again. If I didn't have so many more books to read, I'd probably start it again right now--and it's not even out yet. I'd highly, highly recommend it, although I wouldn't call it an easy read. It's fodder for the brain, but it's also accessible and won't go over your head."}, {"userName": "Tianna Moxley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77062733-tianna-moxley", "userReview": "The deep, dark depths of the human condition are explored at a remarkably dangerous scale in Fuminori Nakamura's latest novel, Cult X. What begins as a seemingly simple missing persons case turns into a wildly divergent journey that will have you critically thinking about your government, your society, and your own motivations by the time you put the novel down. With deceptions so real they have even you fooled and characters whose true nature is a question even to themselves, you will never see your world the same again."}, {"userName": "Theunis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77201748-theunis", "userReview": "Gave up after 100 pages. Boring."}, {"userName": "Don Hackett", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126934-don-hackett", "userReview": "41/2 stars. Published in the US by Soho Crime, written a known crime writer, this turned out to be so much more than I expected. The story is set around two \"cults\", one a revisionist Buddhism preached by a benign leader, the other nihilistic and hedonistic preached by twisted, manipulative leader who plots a terrorist attack. It has parallels with Dostoyevsky--not Crime and Punishment but the foundational noir The Brothers Karamazov. In a central place is not the tale of Grand Inquisitor, but the last sermons of the two cult leaders. (Dostoyevsky is mentioned several times, letting you know the parallels are not accidental.) In part the book seems to be in dialogue with Dostoyevsky's Christianity. Don't let \"Dustyevsky\", as he is called in Look Homeward, Angel scare you away; there is action, suspension, violence, and some explicit, unsentimental sex.

As he progresses in his quest, the reader is exposed to a variety of topics, ranging from sex and violence to religion, astrophysics and neuroscience.This gives the author the opportunity to write about all kinds of subjects, with long discourses ranging from good and evil to Japanese politics, from war criminals to peace. Perhaps inspired by the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, the novel is an examination of what attraction extremism has to most people.The reader has to plow through more than 500 pages of this material, struggling to grasp all the meanings and context in what starts out as a simple love story. And the task is hardly easy. It takes a lot of effort and for that reason it is rated lower than one would expect a book written by this author, whose past works received [deservedly] higher ratings. Nevertheless, Nakamura pushes us to the limits in his writings, which have made him one of the top Japanese authors. For this reason, for those willing to stick with it, Cult X is recommended"}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616058-annie", "userReview": "I found Fuminori Nakamura\u2019s Cult X (translated by Kalau Almony) infuriating. I requested it because I am fascinated by cults. Being an atheist, I want to understand what draws people to religion. Cults are the most extreme versions of religion; charismatic leaders with a good story suck people in for various reasons and followers stay even if it all goes wrong. What leads people to do that? Cult X does answer that question, as well as tries to answer what it is that drives those charismatic leaders to try and lead people off the cliffs with them. My problem with the book is that it is packed with lectures by male characters, with barely any attention paid to the women who appear in the novel. By the time I got to the end, I was sick of mansplaining and female characters who were treated as little more than sex dolls. There were some interesting ideas here, just not enough to make up for those two major problems...Read the rest of my review at A Bookish Type. I received a free copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley, for review consideration."}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24119964-christie", "userReview": "I find this a difficult book to rate/review. As a fan of Nakamura's other works, I was hopeful starting out. I enjoyed the first parts of the book, especially Matsuo's lectures relating to philosophy, physics, and metaphysics, but the book quickly went in directions that I didn't find myself enjoying. I liked the overall ideas within/behind the plot (the psychology of trauma and societal alienation, cults and brainwashing, governmental/corporate/humanitary injustices), but I ended up dissatisfied with the execution overall. As opposed to characters in other books by Nakamura, I found the characters in this book to come across as more one dimensional. There were several \"wtf\" moments for me while reading this book.....I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is uncomfortable with detailed explicit/graphic sexual content and descriptions of rape. Overall, I debated whether my personal rating should be 2 or 3 stars....I was compelled enough to see my reading through to the end but I wouldn't say that I \"liked\" the book. For me, it was just ok. I will definitely continue reading works by this author but this is definitely not my favorite."}, {"userName": "Sherwestonstec", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5994732-sherwestonstec", "userReview": "An intriguing book about politics, religion and sex. One leader Matsuo, who is good, and the other Sawatari a hideous evil man. Throw in a missing girlfriend, Ryoko who goes by many names, a few government agents, many sex scenes and you have a very confusing novel at times. The ending does clear everything up and rounds out the story well. The book jacket says \u201cInspired by the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, Cult X is an explorations of what draw\u2019s individuals into extremism. This multifaceted novel is nothing less than a tour de force, capturing the connections between astrophysics neuroscience, and religion. It is an invective against predatory corporate consumerism and exploitative geopolitics, and it is a love story about compassion the the face of nihilism.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Angie Boyter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter", "userReview": "My Goodreads rating reflects my personal reaction to this book, but many people might enjoy it.

He finds that there opposing groups that each have separate purposes. The reader is taken on the journey deeper into the worlds of the cults as the main character tries to find his friend. Nakamura tells this story through a 3rd person narrator, transcripts of the lectures from one of the gurus, and the diary entries. I have read a lot about the Aum Shinrikyo cult (Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche) and Charles Manson (Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson); this book gave a unique fictional portrayal of how these cults can thrive. Nakamura touches on several questions as the narrative unfolds: How does the leader manipulate and fill the perceived needs of his or her followers? What role does history, a society's taboos and mores, and a person's individual situation have in their search for personal and universal meaning?Ultimately, this book is challenging. It's dense and far from a pager-turner at times. It can be especially rough when going through the leader's lectures that comment on formal religion, physicals, cellular biology, evolution, and many other topics. And a warning: there are several very graphic sexual scenes. This is not a book for a young person or one who is uncomfortable with reading content of that nature."}], "description": "The magnum opus by Akutagawa Prize-winner Fuminori Nakamura, Cult X is a story that dives into the psychology of fringe religion, obsession, and social disaffection.When Toru Narazaki\u2019s girlfriend, Ryoko, disappears, he tries to track her down, despite the warnings of a private detective he\u2019s hired to find her. Ryoko\u2019s past is shrouded in mystery, but the one concrete clue to her whereabouts is a previous address where she lived: in a compound in the heart of Tokyo, with a group that seems to be a cult led by a charismatic guru with a revisionist Buddhist scheme of life, death, and society. Narazaki plunges into the secretive world of the cult, ready to expose himself to any of the guru\u2019s brainwashing tactics if it means he can learn the truth about Ryoko. But the cult isn\u2019t what he expected, and he has no idea of the bubbling violence beneath its surface.Inspired by the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, Cult X is an exploration of what draws individuals into extremism.
