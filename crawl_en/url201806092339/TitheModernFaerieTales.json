You will either love it or hate it. Personally, I absolutely love gritty real-life/fantasy stories when they're written well, and I think Holly Black does the combination so much freaking justice. It doesn't try too hard to be overly badass. Kaye is such a great lead -- although I don't always see myself in her actions throughout the book, I still liked her because she was real. I never got the sense that Holly Black was trying to impress me; she was just writing about a real girl. And honestly, when I compare female leads in other books, I always think about Kaye and if they live up to her standards (which is not often enough for me).So many people cut down Tithe for its \"objectionable\" content, but I was actually able to find a lot of realism in the way most of the characters behaved. As I was growing up, the teenagers I knew cursed like sailors and were always trading stories about sex. Unfortunately or not, it's a way of life nowadays -- teenagers are naturally curious. I think in this case, Holly Black's choice to include these situations and words make her characters come alive. However, that's not all Tithe is about -- people want to focus on that, but it's only a small portion of the entire book. Tithe is different, and some people just don't enjoy or understand how YA can fit that profile. But that's the one thing I appreciate about Holly Black.: her ability to take YA to another level. She proves that the genre doesn't have to be a complete trope-fest with beginnings and ends that fit together perfectly.For me, Holly Black's writing in Tithe is really hard to pin down. It's like a combination of trippy and poetic. The way she describes things, you feel like you're reading poetry -- I love the detail she pours into Tithe. I think my favorite sections have to be when she describes the faeries and where they live -- she makes it all gothic-y and enchanting and it just makes me feel like I have a spell cast over me that forces me to be in this complete daze. I can't get out of it if I wanted to. I just keep reading every sentence she writes and loving them."}, {"userName": "Julie Kagawa", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2364898-julie-kagawa", "userReview": "Tithe is a very raw, very dark faerie tale. While not suitable for younger readers (lots of swearing, random torture and violence, and mature themes), I loved its take on the darker side of faerie. It deals with faerie themes like Changelings and the knowing of one's True Name very well, and Roiben is probably my favorite faery hero of all time. (Kind of like Sephiroth. If you know who Sephiroth is, you'll understand.) The writing was a teensy bit sporadic and hard to follow at first. I found myself going back and re-reading passages to understand them. All-in-all, though, a great story for older, more mature audiences. By the time I got to its sequel, Ironside, I was hooked on Holly Black."}, {"userName": "manda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5548051-manda", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "destiny \u2620 howling libraries", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15335689-destiny-howling-libraries", "userReview": "Holly Black\u2019s writing was my first introduction to fae fiction; as a kid, I was obsessed with all sorts of fae mythology, but typically was limited to nonfiction until the first time I saw Tithe on the \u201cnew\u201d shelf at my library. I must have checked this book out and reread it four or five times within the first couple of years, but this was my first reread since I was a preteen, and I had no idea what to expect!\nIf curiosity killed the cat, it was satisfaction that brought it back.\nI had forgotten so much of the plot in this book, and the first thing that surprised me upon rereading it was actually how problematic some of the writing is! If you\u2019re a newer fan of Holly\u2019s and haven\u2019t read her old work, here\u2019s your warning: this book involves racist remarks, homophobic slurs, attempted sexual assault, and some potentially sleazy romance dynamics, most of this going entirely unchallenged as the story unfolds. After one character tries to assault the protagonist, there are even one or two instances in which she talks about feeling flattered by his refusal to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer.\n \u201cAnd if I said nothing at all?\u201d\u201cThen I would point out that sometimes, if you look at something out of the corner of your eye, you can see right through glamour.\u201d\nOn a more positive note, I had also forgotten how totally addicting the storyline is, how fun and gothic the aesthetic feels, and how lovable Roiben is. While I stand by the fact that the blossoming romance has potential to be problematic, it genuinely doesn\u2019t feel as though Kaye is taking advantage of him with her power over his name. Everything comes across as fully consensual, albeit quite a bit rushed and insta-lovey.\n \u201cI am your servant,\u201d the King of the Unseelie Court said, his lips a moment from her own. \u201cConsider it done.\u201d\nMore than anything, though, I just love the way Holly crafts her fae worlds. Unlike most of today\u2019s popular fae writers, she stays true to the old folklore in many prominent fashions, and my favorite aspect of that is the way she weaves in different types of feyfolk (like sprites, pixies, kelpies, etc.). I have always said that I think Holly is almost singlehandedly responsible for the world of fae YA fiction that so many of us now know and love, and after reading Tithe, despite its imperfections, I adamantly stand by that belief."}, {"userName": "Mary-Beth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119580-mary-beth", "userReview": "Kaye is obviously incredibly lovely and then it turns out she's a magical fairy. Sure her life is hard, but it's the fairies making it that way because she's so important that they're all out to get her. Look, what I'm saying is, it's like the author tried to think of all the coolest latest trends among teenagers and tried to mash them into a fairy story. Kaye is also not anyone's typical teenager. She has super special protagonist syndrome.I found the Faerie described by the author quite interesting and the details of that land were the one bright spot in the novel and along with my boredom probably the only thing that kept me reading.You name and it and it's not been done very well: the writing is messy, the characters are contrived and the romance has all of the warmth of a burned out match."}, {"userName": "Eryn\u2735", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17568354-eryn", "userReview": "\u2605 1 / 5 \u2605There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to write an entire review for this.

To which I thought, \"Ooh, yes likee me please. DARK BOOKS ARE GREAT.\" Buuuut I have to admit, it wasn't THAT dark. After one reads books like Red Rising and An Ember in the Ashes....ha. It takes a lot to chill me. BUT ANYWAY. I did like Tithe even though I thought it was going to be more evilly darker. Obviously there are plenty of creeptastic faeries and death everywhere and blood splatters and YEAH IT WAS QUITE GOOD AND I LIKED IT. I confess I didn't love it though? This was mostly because of the characters. I just wasn't a fan of any of the characters. For a quickie character breakdown:\u2022 Kaye: She's the narrator and she's just...ya know. Tough girl. Had a crappy childhood. Standoffish. Independent. Doesn't take boo from anyone. OKAY I GET IT, YOU GOT THIS. But you don't got this because you keep doing incredible stupid things. Like \"Oh there is the palace of the evil faerie queen! I'm just gonna take a quick peek.\" I don't know what Kaye was planing to see??? Faeries drinking evil tea???? Omg. So while, obviously, the book wouldn't have been interesting if Kaye hadn't been curious -- she still got other people into plenty of trouble because she was brash. And her attitude towards others just...bleh. But she was half Japanese, so yay! Diversity!\u2022 Corny: He was pretty much awesome. I liked him! But I would've liked to see him actually have character development. Although WOAH DUDE HE HAS SOME GREAT STUFF HAPPEN AT THE END AND IT WAS VERY WOAH THIS IS EXCITING AND DISTURBING. So that was fun.\u2022 Roiben: He's the faerie knight who's bound to an evil queen and he has to do bad stuff for lolz. I mean, I like the dude. BUT. I still feel a bit indifferent to him. I did like his romance with Kaye though....and also their names??! Like, ughhhhh. I'm not a fan of any of their names and I found that kind of hard while reading.The plot is only half about faeries. The faeries don't really come in until 100-pages in!! 'SCUSE YOU, BUT I ORDERED A CREEPY FAERIE BOOK. Not a \"my mama don't love me\" book. The beginning is all moving around because Kaye's mother is a band member who can't keep a position. So cue alcohol and parties and copious smoking which makes me angry in books because smoking really gives you cancer omg grrr. It really started getting interesting when Kaye learned who she really was and started getting involved with Roiben...who she met when eh was shot and bleeding everywhere. OMG #shipit I also liked how the book \"fixed\" a problem and Kaye felt all triumphant and everything -- but in reality she'd really destroyed an ancient hierarchy and system. So YEAH it was bad, but the alternative could be worse. And I just like moral questions like that and chain-of-even reactions. BASICALLY I LIKE BOOKS WHERE THE ENDING IS DOOM. (Mwhahaha.)So it's not my favourite Holly Black book...sadly. But I'm still reading the next two books ASAP because I love Holly Black and I LOVE creepy faeries and I so want to see where the story is going. And I do like it!! Just in the light of Holly Black's other epic books, this one does feel weak. And Kaye was just so, ugh, unlikeable for me. And while there was blood everywhere, I didn't feel there was a lot of EMOTIONAL reactions. Just physical ones. I wanted to know how the characters felt about being tortured and whatnot. C'mon, dudes. Cry or something and I'll comfort you with chocolate cupcakes or something."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "I was a cringey kid, but to be real...

Now, following an barfight, Kaye and her would-be-rock star mother return to Kaye's childhood home. There, Kaye meets another faery, and discovers that her childhood friends really do exist and that she is far more unusual than she ever suspected. She soon falls into the middle of the power struggle between two rival faery courts, a struggle which could easily spill into the human world. Tithe is a mix of wonderful and horrible aspects: the characters are difficult to like or identify with, and the writing style is inconsistent and immature, but the plot is realistically complex (even though it ends abruptly) and the faeries are dark, enthralling, and vividly conceived (if overdrawn). I found this book at times both frustrating and wonderful, and though it has many faults, I still recommend it for its plot and atmosphere, as well as its great potential.At the beginning of reading Tithe, the weaknesses far outweigh the strengths. Kaye, her mother, and her friends are neither likable nor identifiable\u0097Kaye's mother is a struggling rock vocalist, Kaye is a high school drop out, Janet is a superficial teenager, Corny is an unattractive gas station attendant; everyone drinks too much and smokes too much. Maybe I just lived a sheltered life, but wouldn't have identified with any of these characters as a young adult, and I still don't now as an adult. They are not likable, nor are their flaws realistic\u0097instead, they are exaggerated and simplistic. Along with difficult characterization, the writing style is inconsistent and immature, replete with adverbs, repeated gestures, and dull dialog and episodes. This is clearly a first novel, and accordingly it feels unfinished and unpolished. The book would have benefited from a rewrite, to tighten the language and unify the style.But for all of these negative qualities, Tithe remains readable and exhibits some real jewels and true potential as it goes on. The plot moves just fast enough that it is not frustrating and slow enough that it is still intriguing. There are many points where the book could have ended prematurely, wrapping up the plot into a nice and neat package; Black, however, rejects these endings, instead introducing new complications to build a plot that is is political, complex, and ongoing. The unfortunate effect of the ongoing story is that the book has an indistinct ending\u0097although not a cliffhanger, it seems arbitrary and incomplete. On the whole, however, the complex plot fits the book's wide political premise and makes for a satisfying read. The faeries are equally satisfying: they are otherworldly, diverse, and carefully imagined. Some of the dark faeries are overdrawn and excessively macabre, but on the whole the faeries are the highlight of the text. Black's imagination is lively and wide; her descriptions (in particular Kaye's transformation) shine off of the page in vivid language that is at once ethereal and tactile.I found this to be an alternately frustrating and delightful book. The characters disappointed me, the writing style annoyed me, but whenever I became too frustrated, another new aspect would shine: a banquet scene in a faery court, a new plot development, some measure of character growth. So while I can't rate this book very highly on account of its many faults, I do recommend it. Less critical readers may not find it so frustrating as I did; no matter the reader, the magic and imagination make this a book worth reading. There is great potential here, and where it is realized, Tithe is a truly enjoyable read. I look forward to reading more of Black's published work\u0097I expect that as she matured as a writer, her books became more readable and less frustrating."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "\"Tithe: A Modern Faerie Tale\" is about sixteen year old Kaye Fierch, a girl who has been moving around with her single mother for her entire life. At a young age she has been able to see and interact with these things called faeries, although no one believed her. Then one day, she enchants a boy into falling in love with her and makes a broken, splintered horse move. Soon after that event she meets a young faerie night named Roiben, and that is just the start of her faerie adventure.Hm... okay, the reason I picked up this book was because I heard that it had a gay side character. On that note, this character, Corny, was absolutely underdeveloped. In fact, almost all of the side characters were underdeveloped, I felt like I didn't know a single thing about any of them. This book also feels like it moves from event to event, but not with the grace or ability that a good author has to string her storyline together. There were some scenes that were just plain difficult to read. Some examples are when Kaye told Robien to \"kiss her ass\", and Robien actually did because he was \"bound\" to her. If Robien was bound to do what Kaye demanded of him, then I think Robien would've understood that what Kaye demanded of him wasn't the literal sense of what she said, but the emotional sense. Also, there was a scene where Corny is in the underground faerie hill with this strange prince character, and then Corny is tortured. Like, he is completely helpless and starts eating everything he can get his hands on. A rotten apple. The dirt on the ground. And some ants. For Pete's sake, when I read that, I thought I was going to be sick. And what's even weirder is that NO ONE even CARED about what happened to him. In fact, the only thing in the book that acknowledges that the event occurred is when Corny starts blindly stabbing his tormentor to death. Which was a total \"huh?\" moment to me.This is the first book I have deemed worthy of one star.

It was recommended to my 14 year old, Gini. She began the book and then brought it to me saying that she didn't feel it was appropriate for kids and that she, personally, had no interest in a heroine who consistently made such poor life choices. Well! I decided to read it to see what the deal was. This book was recommended for kids 14 and up and Gini has read books that were definitely adult reading level and she LOVES faery. The problem with this book for Gini (and I am proud of her for it) is that the girl, Kaye, who is the main character, as well as her friends, smoke, drink, sneak around, fool around, and generally make all the choices that parents hope their children will avoid. Gini loves books and movies with really strong female characters. Ultraviolet, Alias, Charmed, Dragonlance, Bones and Sarah Connor Chronicles are some of her favorites. She just really didn't like the idea that a 16 year old who was so \"messed up\" and misguided would be turned into a heroine of faery. She appreciates that the best heroines have flaws to overcome but this just didn't work for her.Now! All that that being said, I finished the book and for an adult with the grace of age and perspective, this book is a fun, light read. This poor kid who has pretty much raised herself and her mother could very well end up the same dead-end mess that her mother has but she doesn't. She discovers something very special within herself. She ends up showing a lot of character and courage. The teens dealt with in the book are not the teens that I have guided my girls to become or to identify with but those kids are out there and they have the same potential and beauty within them. It was really cool to talk to Gini about why she didn't like this character and how the character developed without requiring her to read something she objected to and without glorifying the type of kid portrayed in the book. This is just my opinion folks so take it for what it is worth to you! I would not have this book in the hands of anyone under 16 and even at 16, my girls would probably not read this type of material if for no other reason than the frequency of the \"f\" word which we don't appreciate in our home, hearts or heads and the underage drinking and sexuality. But if you do have a child who wants to read it and you don't like to censor your child's reading (and I do very little of that, believe it or not - I teach them the principles and let them apply them, which Gini did very well) then this book is a good opportunity to talk about the choices the kids in the book make. Why it may or may not be a good idea for an author to portray a young person with such poor judgement as a hero or heroine (I thought it was a great idea!) and how people can turn their lives around no matter how dismal and dead-end they seem to be."}, {"userName": "samantha  (books-are-my-life20)", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27251572-samantha-books-are-my-life20", "userReview": "I read this book in one day!!!!

I don't mind gory horror, but what I truly love is that creepy feeling I get with mysterious and intriguing books like this one. And while Tithe did not leave me in awe, it was still very well-written, and it kept me hooked from beginning to end. Holly Black is one of my favorite fantasy authors. She wrote The Curse Workers trilogy, my favorite urban fantasy series of all time, but I also knew she had written this book twelve years ago, and I've always thought that most (not all) authors are a bit like wine: they get better as time passes. So I was not expecting anything nearly as good as The Curse Workers, but this book still managed to surprise me.It surely had a lot of clich\u00e9s of the genre - some insta-love, a quirky sidekick like Corny (even though his storyline quickly took an unexpected darker turn) and mostly forgettable secondary characters.However, not only the writing was very good (there were a couple of metaphors that really took my breath away), but this book was dark. Extremely dark for a YA book. In fact, I would not recommend it to younger teens at all, but I appreciated this new kind of perspective immensely. Teenagers in this book are not the goody two-shoes we're used to, the usual perfect kids that never do anything wrong. These teenagers drink, smoke, party and have sex. They have difficult relationships with their families and with each other, they swear and they lie, and they usually result much more realistic than your average YA characters. I will soon read the second and third book in the series, because this was an interesting start and, although somehow flawed, it was also something new and unexpected that I want to see more of. The plot may be a bit basic, but Holly's portrayal of the fae world is not. I was particularly impressed by the way she described the Unseelie Court, a place of viciousness and pleasure and pain - and its inhabitants weren't any different. It was intriguing, and dangerous. They all were. As for the characters, I did not care too much for any of them, but I was fascinated by the unconventional main character, Kaye, and her dysfunctional family, and I can't wait to know what's going to happen to Corny, Kaye's human friend who forgot common sense and delved a little too deep into the faerie courts. Tithe was a good book, and despite the things I did not like about it, it was definitely not average. And even though it's one of Holly's early works, I know she will still somehow manage to surprise me."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "He slid out of bed, scratching his balls through once-white briefs, and sat down in front of the computer.Ok, now I remember WHY I hated Holly Black's writing before finally enjoying White Cat.

Both The Darkest Part of the Forest and The Coldest Girl in Coldtown were five star books for me, and this is coming from someone who typically gets bored by fantasy after a chapter or two.There\u2019s something about Holly Black\u2019s writing style that is so lovely and dark and perfectly fitting for the stories she tells.With the release of The Cruel Prince, which is getting a ridiculous amount of hype right now, I decided I wanted to read Black\u2019s original fae trilogy, more out of curiosity than anything else.As someone used to reading more polished works from this author, going back to her debut was a bit underwhelming, though it makes sense. There\u2019s going to be a gap in quality between a book published in 2002 and one published in 2018.Let\u2019s reflect on the fact that this series was first published in 2002. Damn, that\u2019s early for YA novels - pre-Twilight and pre-The Hunger Games. Holly Black wrote a paranormal romance before paranormal romances were even a thing.Here\u2019s a crazy part: this book is one of the more diverse fantasy series I\u2019ve read. AND IT WAS PUBLISHED IN 2002. I really don\u2019t want to hear excuses about how early YA series couldn\u2019t have diverse characters - this one (which is actually pretty popular and published by a major publishing house) had a main character who is mixed race (white and Japanese) and an explicitly gay main character who has a romantic plotline in the final book.The book itself has a lot of room to grow, which Black did as she continued to publish books. It\u2019s entertaining and has seeds of the lyrical prose I have come to expect from Black, but it\u2019s just not...great.Tithe: I mean, I was expecting more of a dark fairytale, so I\u2019ll admit I was a bit disappointed when this ended up being more in the vein of paranormal romance. It has a lot of the hallmarks of the starts to early YA fantasy series, but the writing is bit better than those books usually are.Valiant: Why was this book even a thing? It was like this random companion novel that had no impact on the series. And it was boring. I wish I\u2019d skipped it.Ironside: Definitely the best of the three. The most entertaining, some cool plot stuff, character development, writing improvement. Almost made the whole series worth it!Overall, I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend this series. Holly Black has books that are so much better, and I wouldn\u2019t waste my time with these unless I\u2019m a really diehard fan. I\u2019m even more excited to tackle The Cruel Prince now - I can\u2019t wait to see how Holly Black writes faeries 16 years after her first faerie novel was published!"}, {"userName": "Seth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63444-seth", "userReview": "Summary: comfortably predictable storyline with some huge plot holes, but more than fun enough to read.

This book is marred by one major flaw that doesn't affect most of the YA set: bad things happen--both on- and off-stage--to sympathetic characters around our protagonist and no one cares. Several \"best friend\" character die, the two mothers are left bereft of their children, a small child is abandoned to the faeries, and the nearby world is beset by death and destruction, but it doesn't affect the main, teen-aged protagonist and we only follow her pursuit of a dangerous older man who doesn't want to use her naivety no matter how much she tries to make him. His self-recriminations--even while he's killing innocents--for making out with her while she was drunk make for a great character. In addition, the important and interesting family drama with her wanna-be rocker mom and her controlling and narrow-minded grandmother is left not only unresolved, but probably unresolvable. Fortunately, the faerie plotline is well handled, if 100% comfort-food, even for the YA crowd. Our protagonist is asked to play the role of the sacrifice victim in a faerie sacrifice taken straight from Tam Lin, with the promise that her good faerie friends will save her at the end and reveal thats the bad faeries had broken the rules. Of course, \"good\" and \"bad\" will intermingle and swap around throughout the course of the story (as is appropriate in a faerie tale) and she has to look after herself and mis-trust her lifelong faerie friends. She does a passable job of wising up, if not growing up, and the action-y scenes are quite fun as her wanna-be beau fights off orders to kill her, she tries to rescue her almost-friend from a dangerous lover, and both the supposedly good and definitely bad faeries line up to use her for their political ends even if it means killing her. So it's a fun read, but don't expect any of the usual YA moral or character growth. Pure entertaining fluff."}, {"userName": "Rebecca \u2665 Warner, Kishan, Magnus \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/703854-rebecca-warner-kishan-magnus", "userReview": "This was so much fun! I started out very unsure about it, since it was recommended to me by a The Iron Fey fan, I was expecting something else. But Tithe is far darker than The Iron King. It was very thematic and I was thrown off by the heroine's heavy drinking, smoking, swearing, and shoplifting, a girl of 16. But once I got acquainted with its world different is not necessarily bad.Kaye attracts the attention of a gorgeous fey of the Unseelie Court, a knight. Roiben has the whole victim-of-circumstances vibe down, but I was actually a little scared of Roiben in the beginning. He seemed so evil and menacing. I was hesitant to start liking him, but eventually I couldn't resist him anymore! The romance was well played out, better than some YA. But I don't know if anything will ever beat The Iron Fey in my mind.Being only my second faerie series, it was interesting to see the similarities and differences from The Iron Fey. I was not previously familiar with ideas of faerie glamour, and the courts, and I didnt know how much was unique to The Iron Fey. So that was interesting and I now have a better grasp of it. I found the story very interesting and exciting with a lot of twists and turns. But the very best part is the ending! It ended on such a great note I couldn't stop giggling.The ending. THE ENDING!

Just a thought.It went fast, but I'm glad I decided to reread this. I blew through nearly half of it in two hours last night and wrapped up the rest this afternoon -- I think it's a testament to Holly Black's skill that even though I flew through this book I was never bored and skimmed minimally. I liked how the world of Faery wasn't necessarily the happy, pretty world we all assume a world of sprites and pixies to be like -- there was darkness and danger and even the characters Kaye thought she knew turned out to be the opposite. And Roiben is swoon-worthy. The last time I read this was in high school and he was sexy then too; I'm glad this book held up over the years."}, {"userName": "Rachael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1028829-rachael", "userReview": "Kaye has always been different. She\u2019s Japanese and a natural blond. She stopped going to school when she was fourteen because her musician mother kept them moving around. But what made the other kids really back away were the stories about her friends Gristle, Spike, and Lutie-loo. Everyone thought they were imaginary because no one besides Kaye could see these creatures. That\u2019s because Kaye\u2019s friends were part of the world of Faery.Kaye is dragged farther into this dangerous world when she saves a dying faerie named Roiben. After this encounter, she meets up with her old friend Lutie and Spike only to find out that her other friend Gristle has been murdered by the faerie she saved earlier, Roiben. Her friend then bring her into the plot to let the solitary fey be free for seven years: Kaye has to break the tithe, a ritual in which a mortal is sacrificed for the Unseelie Court. And with that, she is in the middle of a war between that the two powerful faerie courts.Holly Black presents a fantastical faerie world similar to the one in Melissa Marr\u2019s Wicked Lovely, yet it is difficult to compare the two. Both Kaye and Aislinn are strong-minded characters, but it is the setting and the rest of the faerie world that makes the stories so different; Kaye\u2019s is one filled with drinking and shoplifting. I appreciated how Kaye is unapologetic for who she is and found it amusing that Kaye didn\u2019t know her own cleverness. I also found Kaye and Roiben\u2019s relationship extremely romantic.I highly recommend this exciting story, especially for fans of other faerie stories. I definitely look forward to reading more of Black\u2019s faerie novels.reposted from http://thebookmuncher.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Alaina Meserole", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina-meserole", "userReview": "I knew nothing about this book before I started to read it. I mean, I pretty much just picked up this book because it helped fit a category in a reading challenge, cool title, I like butterflies, and a new author all wrapped in one? Heck yeah, get in my hands and come home with me book!I love any kind of fairytale or retelling book so I was super excited for a modern faerie tale! However, Tithe has kind of left me torn. I have no idea how to write out this book review. WHY? Well because I assumed it was going to be a darker tale but yeah, it really wasn't. Now I'm not saying that I hated the book or didn't enjoy it. I definitely did but I guess I just expected more? I liked the characters and thought Kaye was pretty interesting. Then there's the adventure which was pretty interesting and definitely didn't leave me bored. But when a review or a person say this book is going to be dark I expect a blackout kind of dark. I just kind of got a tor-dip into the darkness.

Corny, on the other hand, is such an odd combination of qualities that I found him very believable and more sympathetic, and Roiben's stoicism and inner conflict make him a deliciously imperfect hero.The plot is gritty and exciting, with fairly good pacing, if a little rushed toward the end. Adults and teens alike can enjoy this gem of a book."}, {"userName": "Roshani Chokshi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26262898-roshani-chokshi", "userReview": "I used to be ridiculously anti-social at family parties and hide out with this book. TITHE was so formative for me as a writer. Unapologetic and gorgeous. TITHE tore off the wings of fairytales and gave them fangs, claws and thorns. I wanted to be Kaye so badly I'd sometimes wander around in my backyard looking for a wounded elf prince. Sadly, no paranormal paramour for me. Although I did date a boy with werewolf sideburns.

Sixteen-year-old Kaye is the daughter of a rocker mom who moves from town to town before an act of violence pushes them back to New Jersey. Kaye thinks the faeries of her youth are a thing of the past, but soon, her world starts changing as she learns that she has been chosen as a sacrifice between faery courts. Kaye must struggle to save herself, her friend, and a certain faery knight. Unfortunately, this world of Faerie is not very likeable or easy to read. First and foremost, I found the book difficult to read due to the writing style and lack of editing. The writing is unclear in many places, with disjointed sentences and weak dialogue. Transitions between scenes were abrupt, and it was sometimes difficult to gain a coherent understanding of what was happening. Though some settings were described well, the characters were not. Character development was limited, and the relationships between characters seemed weak and unimportant. As described, the love connection also didn't seem believable. Secondly, Black's world of Faerie is dark, twisted, and cruel. I don't mind darker tales; however, there needs to be a point to it. The book contains vulgarity; smoking, alcohol, and drugs; unhealthy relationships; references to violent, hurtful sex that`s enjoyed; and grisly murder and torture. I knew some of this going in, but I was surprised that none of these issues were used as a means of character development or conflict. None of the characters seemed to have any redeeming or likeable qualities. Even if a character is flawed, I want to read a book where I want to root for him/her, despite these flaws or a sordid past. In this case, I was left feeling ambivalent towards everyone. While a good concept with potential for a great tale, my negative reaction to this book was much stronger than I expected. I hope that Black brought her fans something better in the sequels, Valiant: A Modern Tale of Faerie and Ironside: A Modern Faery's Tale."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2098381-heather", "userReview": "I find it rather hard to choose what type of review I would like to write, positive or negative. I suppose mine will be a bit of both. One the one hand, I have to give Holly Black credit for attempting to write characters that do not fall within the norm. Not everyone is of a certain race, hair color, eye color, personality type, etc. and it is refreshing to read something other than a Mary Jane. I can also appreciate any author who is daring enough to include sex, cussing, and drugs into their story. What teenager hasn't partaken in at least one of the three aforementioned activities? However, despite Black's attempt to create a relatable and realistic character, I felt that Black made Kaye rather unidentifiable. She may not have been an All American do gooder, but she certainly fell within a stereotype, just not a very flattering one. She came across as a redneck/goth hybrid if such a thing were possible. She certainly was not anyone I would look up to or befriend. Is this really the kind of woman any of us would strive to be? One that chain smokes, steals, dresses like a street walker, and messes around with her best friend's loser boyfriend? Also, while I can appreciate a book that attempts a unique structure, the writing style was hard to enjoy. It was disjointed and I found myself having to reread several passages in order to make sense of what they were trying to convey. Lastly, Did anyone else find the love between Kaye and Roiben hard to swallow? I get that she thought he was cute, but looks aside, why is Kaye attracted to him exactly? More importantly, why is he attracted to her? Black did a poor job of making their love believable. All in all, the story made for an entertaining read, but it certainly did not live up to the hype."}, {"userName": "DarkHeart \"Vehngeance\"", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1847538-darkheart-vehngeance", "userReview": "I was really looking forward to this book, despite the mixed reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. Black created a wonderful and gritty world. I know some reviewers have complained that Kaye and her life were unrelatable - but that's okay. Not everyone's life is perfect, and some teens do cuss and drink and dabble in drugs. (It's got the same dark quality as Melissa Marr's books - more favorites of mine.) I actually think that made her more interesting and realistic.Kaye's transformation into the world of faery was so wonderfully done. Black did a great job of describing it so that you could really visualize it. She also created strong supporting characters. I loved Corny and think it's great that she created a homosexual teen that wasn't a stereotype and yet felt no need to be preachy. He was just another character who happened to be gay. Roiben was wonderful as well. I loved his back story and how it all played out in regard to the overall story line.All in all, a strong start to a promising series."}], "description": "Welcome to the realm of very scary faeries!Sixteen-year-old Kaye is a modern nomad.
