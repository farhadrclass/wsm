I was emotionally invested in this book from the very first page. Hannah is a single mom, trying to do the best she can every day for her daughter Ellen. But Hannah, like her mother and grandmother before her, has made questionable choices, hidden the truth from the people closest to her, and closed herself off to anyone but her daughter. Now, as the lies begin to unravel, Hannah must make sure that Ellen doesn't repeat the mistakes of the past, but by doing so, she risks losing the love of the person that she loves most in the world. I loved the characters in this book....Hannah, Ellen, Gran, and the rest are such loving, flawed characters...people who are willing to sacrifice their own happiness to ensure that their loved ones are happy, secure, cherished. I loved the role that butterflies have in this book, the themes they represent, that all play a huge part in this story. The heart and soul of this story is the love a mother feels for her child; how, no matter what the consequence for herself, a mother makes choices for her child from the moment life begins to stir inside of her, always doing so with the best intentions, and nothing but the purest of love in her heart. I hope that other readers will love this story and characters as much as I do. This book would be an excellent book club selection, with so many events, choices, and themes to discuss! I received a copy of this book from the author, but all opinions are my own."}, {"userName": "Christine Nolfi", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5194381-christine-nolfi", "userReview": "Brimming with heart-rending choices, The Memory of Butterflies celebrates the unshakeable bonds of parental devotion in an uplifting tale of love\u2019s ability to heal the deepest wounds and silence the darkest regrets.

This is a story about love, loss, lies and truth, but also so much more. It is about the courage to go on and spread your wings, like that of the butterfly. This is such an exquisite book and you will feel so much emotion. You will laugh and you will most definitely cry. This is one of those books that make you feel. You are there. Your life is immersed in these characters. This is the story of Hannah, Ellen and Gran, along with a few secondary characters. This is a book about life and the choices we make, good or bad, they are the choices that we choose given the situations at hand. The characters are rich with life and are very real in your heart. It is at once heart wrenching and heartwarming. It will grab onto your heartstrings and not let go. This is a book to remember. The flow is as effortless as Cub Creek where most of the book takes place. It is extraordinary reading. The dialogue is true to life and rich in detail. The vividness of the surroundings is astounding. You are there. You can hear the birds singing and see the butterflies flitting about. I highly recommend this book. It is a very good read. I will leave you with two quotes that touched me with their authenticity. \"Hope could uplift, but it could also hurt. One never understood how painful hope could be until the last shred of it was ripped away.\" \"Because that's what life was--a series of changes, some painful but sometimes garnering a greater beauty despite the pain.\""}, {"userName": "Shalini", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57308589-shalini", "userReview": "One lie told to oneself and proven to the world again by lies, can be like a rolling stone which keeps on getting bigger and bigger till it destroys everyone in its path\u2026 That\u2019s the basic story line\u2026 This is a story about a mother Hannah and her daughter Ellen and their life from birth till the present. There is mystery, there are secrets, there are relationships, missing babies, dead babies, and a town which allows the past to remain where it is. Grace Greene has written this story with a lot of sensitivity, taking care to bring home the caring and closeness between family members. With all the above sub plots in the story, Grace has brought to the forefront the biggest emotion\u2014 LOVE. Love between a mother and daughter and love between grandparents and granddaughter. I can write about the pros and cons of the story and make a great review. But I cannot hide from a basic fact, universal truth about a mother\u2018s love, that she sacrifices everything for her child, to protect her child, even from the truth about herself. And sometimes fate delivers such twists and turns, that it brings the same loving mother to the crossroads of life, where she cannot help but choose the path which is pure love for her daughter even if the path is morally wrong, just to keep her child from getting hurt. There is so many layers in this story that one is pulled deeper into the life of the mother, Hannah, and I give full credit to the author Grace Greene for drawing this emotion out. It is very rare that an author can show a mother\u2019s love via her words but Grace has done it so beautifully here."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379232-barb", "userReview": "Secrets have a way of coming out--and the longer you keep them, the deeper the repercussions.

I know it's a good one when I go to bed early 'to read just one more chapter' and I'm still there two hours later finishing a novel, as I just could't put it down until then. The Memory of Butterflies was one of those for me. I loved it.Set in rural Virginia, we meet Hannah, her daughter Ellen and Hannah's Gran, Clara. The three are completely enmeshed in each other's lives, living in the isolated family homestead. The house is a part of Hannah and her Grandmother but there has been tragedy there, and there are secrets in the walls. These only increase as Hannah leaves High School and gives birth to Ellen.There are two narrative lines in the book, the present day where Hannah has moved away from Coopers Hollow but is continuously drawn back there, and the early years of little Ellen. Both are compelling but it's the latter which really grabbed me. The later part of the book, when the stories come together is beautifully written and 'real, there aren't any magic wands waved, just people trying to find their way back to each other after devastating revelations.Greene writes extremely well. Her descriptions of Coopers Hollow and Hannah's pottery, and the importance of both to her are key and well realised. When tragedy hits Hannah, I found the heart wrenching sadness of the words almost hard to read.Ostensibly this is another mum/daughter conflict novel but the secrets and the realisation of them set it apart.

And the secrets that are hidden, there were so many secrets! Greene took me on an emotional roller coaster ride throughout the book, from the highest highs to the lowest of lows; I have not felt so many different emotions while reading a book in a very long time. There was one part where I was crying tears along with Hannah, my heart was suffering right along with her.
