Because I didn\u2019t get it. Well, I didn\u2019t get where the blurb came from? Because the story and the blurb didn\u2019t mesh.But let\u2019s start at the beginning. It was slow. Very slow. Very, very slow. Something happened in the first chapter, then we had chapter after chapter of nothing happening, then she disappeared, there was a birth (which had nothing to do with the main story, by the way), he found her again, something completely unrelated happened, they were rescued, someone was killed, she felt betrayed, he groveled, she forgave him. The end.And it was slow. Even when it started moving toward the end, it was a little too late and a little too slow for comfort. Also the fact the main story (the hero and heroine story) was overshadowed by the hordes of secondary characters, continuations of past books, a possible glimpse into a future story, etc.And when we actually got to spend time with Garrett and Sarah, the relationship was bland, emotionally-detached, and rather boring. Even Garrett, my favorite Kelly brother so far, didn\u2019t inspire anything remotely similar to what he inspired when he was merely a secondary character himself.And don\u2019t get me started on the suspense, because there was very little of it, and rather boring as well. It didn\u2019t deliver on the blurb, it didn\u2019t deliver on the term \u201cromantic suspense\u201d, it didn\u2019t deliver at all.It seems to me Ms. Banks should definitely change genres, because I fear she just cannot do the romantic suspense genre any good. Even if you separate those two, she\u2019s not particularly good at them, judging by this book.Blah, boring, uneventful, and torturously slow, this was my last venture into the KGI world, because I\u2019m slowly running out of stars."}, {"userName": "Susanne ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7179798-susanne", "userReview": "[And I would have liked some more grovelling, now she basically forgives him in a second.

Completely and utterly stupid.\u201dHidden Away is the third book in Maya Banks\u2019 KGI series. This is Garrett\u2019s book. In the first book, I loved Garrett. He was a total badass with a soft and sweet side. He was tender and loving towards his sister-in-law who had been kidnapped and left for dead. In the second book, Garrett was a bit of an arse. Okay, he was a total arse. I\u2019ve been looking forward to his book so I could finally know who the real Garrett was. Well, it turns out he\u2019s a little bit from column A and a little bit from column B.Garrett is an ex-Marine who now works with his brothers at KGI, a family run military-type organization that handles hostage/kidnap victim recovery, intelligence gathering and other jobs the U.S. government can\u2019t. He is the second oldest of six brothers, all military men. Garrett is the sour puss in the family. Six years ago, something happened to him while still a Marine and a man named Marcus Lattimer was responsible. As every story needs a very bad man, Lattimer takes on the role in Hidden Away. Garrett hates this guy and wants to take him down. So does the CIA. When the CIA gets a lead that could help capture said very bad man, they enlist Garrett to help since they know he wants this guy as badly as the government does. What\u2019s the lead? Sarah Daniels \u2013 Lattimer\u2019s half sister. *insert dramatic music*Sarah witnessed a murder committed by her brother and is now on the run. The CIA has tracked her down and wants to use her to fish out Lattimer. Garrett is asked to watch her until that happens. Sounds like a pretty simple job right? But even though Sarah is completely green when it comes to running for her life and has been hurt greatly not that long ago, she ends up being more of a handful than anyone expected.I quite enjoyed Sarah\u2019s character. She\u2019s pretty much your typical regular nice girl whose world has suddenly been turned upside down, only to accidentally get involved in her brother\u2019s affairs turning her world inside out. She is doing her best to cope with what has been handed to her. She\u2019s not Wonder Woman or MacGyver and I liked that. She\u2019s very clever and smart, but now without her mistakes. She seemed real to me. I can\u2019t say that I could relate to her because I\u2019ve never been through what she\u2019s been through, but I could definitely feel for her and I wanted her to find her happy ending. And thank goodness Garrett was there to help her there.Garrett was wonderful with Sarah. He needed to be tough sometimes and he needed to be tender sometimes. He wasn\u2019t all macho \u201clook at my big guns\u2026and my weapons are pretty impressive too\u201d. That\u2019s not what Sarah needed and he knew that. I\u2019m telling you, that Ma Kelly sure did raise some pretty impressive sons!I preferred how the plot was laid out this time around to how it was done in the second book. This time not all of the questions were answered at the very beginning. In fact, some answers only came on the second to last page in this book. It made for a much better flow and a more poignant climax. And speaking of climax *wink wink*Even though Maya made us wait and wait and wait for Garrett and Sarah to hook up, it worked well with the story. Once you read it you\u2019ll understand, but doing it any differently would have made Sarah\u2019s struggles unimportant. But once they did get it on\u2026very nice.Now, have you ever read a book where you meet a character and thought \u201cHuh, I\u2019d like to know more about that guy\u201d. Then you read them in the next book and you thought \u201cOMG I want need to know everything about them now! I need his book like yesterday!!!\u201d I had a few moments like that while reading Hidden Away with Donovan and PJ. I need his book and I need her book. The geeky Kelly brother with brains and muscles and the sniper chick who is a total mystery to almost everyone. Need. Their. Books.(Just a quick little side note here\u2026None of the chicks in this series have family. None. What\u2019s with that?)Hidden Away was a good continuation to the series. Garrett and Sarah worked well together. I was not disappointed. Up next is Nathan\u2019s book. It will be called Whispers in the Dark and is scheduled to hit stores in February 2012. *sob* That is an awfully long time to wait for the next book. But I\u2019ll wait because I love the family unit in this series and I love how the friendships are written too.I\u2019ll leave you with one more quote. This one had me giggling out loud and paints a perfect picture of Garrett:\u201c\u2019I was trying not to be an asshole\u2019 he grumbled.\"You break into my house. You take my gun away from me. Informed me you lied about pretty much everything when we were on the island. Then tell me I'm an idiot who's trying to get herself killed. And you're worried about being an asshole?\""}, {"userName": "Elle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2485186-elle", "userReview": "I just don't buy it. Not the book (I bought the book), the story.It was a ridiculous concept and premise, but that's ok because this was suppose to be a romantic suspense. But it wasn't especially suspenseful. Garrett was suppose to be protecting Sarah, but there wasn't all that much protecting, just a lot of running away. So the whole thing ended up just being a big sort of let down. Was the threat as big as they were saying? It didn't seem to be, there wasn't enough drama. See? I don't by it!Now that the story is done, I'm sitting here thinking \"what just happened?\". I mean, there wasn't enough suspense in the romance either, not even as the final romantic conflict was solved.I'll tell you what I did like was the glimpses of other characters and their possible romances. Is it just me or does Rusty seem to be Pairing off with Cam? Now I don't know how likely that would be (how old is Cam?) because you really do have to read this book in sequence. A lot of information about who's who is left out of this story. But I would say we're gonna get a Rusty story and I'm gonna love it. Also, P.J. and Cole. I'm also intrigued by Donovan the geekier brother. Oooo, I like me a sexy geek, I do. And really, I liked Garrett and Sarah as a couple. But that didn't seem enough to elevate this book above 3 stars.If nothing else, this book was a good into into the series. I haven't read book 1 or 2 (and I might not) but I'll be keeping my eye open for book 4 and any other books."}, {"userName": "Pamela(AllHoney)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/884792-pamela-allhoney", "userReview": "The third book in Maya Banks' KGI series.

Before Marcus whisks Sarah away to a quite location to heal, he tracks down and murders Alan in cold blood. Sarah witnesses the aftermath of Marcus\u2019 killing and flees the scene, running into Stanley on her way out. Knowing Stanley will soon learn of Alan\u2019s murder, and wanting to protect her brother and herself, Sarah flees the country with no plan of action except escape. Long connected with various illegal organizations, Marcus\u2019 killing does not escape notice. CIA contact Resnick calls a meeting with the KGI Team to inform them of Marcus\u2019s latest murder and to enlist their help in tracking his whereabouts. Garrett Kelly, former military soldier and now member of the KGI Team is determined to take the job. It\u2019s a personal mission for Garrett as Marcus double-crossed Garrett years ago and as a result two of Garrett\u2019s teammates were killed. Garrett takes off to the remote Isle de Bijoux where Sarah is hiding out so he can watch and wait for Marcus to join her. What Garrett doesn\u2019t count on is falling for the fragile and vulnerable Sarah in the process.There were elements of the story which I continue to love in the KGI series, but I feel that Hidden Away fell a bit short. In the previous installments, we had strong and capable heroes and heroines. They were not without faults or tragedies, but they persevered. While Sarah had a traumatic event in her life, her neurotic paranoia and broken spirit exhausted me through much of the book. Garrett\u2019s patience and sensitivity with Sarah was heartwarming, but their overall chemistry lacked the spark I expected. In The Darkest Hour and No Place to Run, Garrett was a broody, stoic and introverted man who, never-the-less was a hard core badass. A woman who brought out his primal passion and intensity, as opposed to appealing to his caregiver instincts would have made for a more satisfying pairing. I also think this would have aided the pace of the book. I understand the relationship had to develop slowly due to Sarah\u2019s past, but I did not expect to wait over 200 pages for their relationship to progress to the next level and for Garrett and Sarah to become intimate. Also, for a romantic suspense novel, the slow build-up hampered the tension and was uncharacteristic of the series. My relative disinterest in the main couple made me more interested in the developments of the other Kelly brothers (I want Donovan\u2019s book now!) and KGI team members.What I always enjoy about this series is the family unity Ms. Banks portrays in each book. If I ever wanted to be adopted into a fictional family, it would be the Kelly\u2019s. They protect their own and have a solid devotion to each family member. In Hidden Away, we reconnect with Ethan and Rachel as well as Sam and Sophie from the prior two books. There is also a great scene with the brothers and Rusty (Mama Kelly\u2019s stray foster child) that will melt your heart and solidify how devoted each brother is to family. Blood or not.While I didn\u2019t particularly connect with Sarah and Garrett did not fully met my expectations, I am devoted to the Kelly brothers and am happy to report that Ms. Banks will be continuing the KGI series and releasing information about the next two books soon!Favorite Quote: \u201cWhen she looked up there was a predatory gleam in Garrett\u2019s eyes. A look that told her she was his and he planed to lay claim. Oh but she loved that look. No one had ever looked at her with such intensity. Like he dared anyone to take what was his anyway. Like he wanted to devour her in a single bite and savor the taste.\u201d* For those concerned readers out there, the rape scene is not spoken about in detail."}, {"userName": "Katyana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1891730-katyana", "userReview": "[I can't get over the fact that he chose to seduce a rape victim, while lying to her about everything. I get he cared about her, I get the panting attraction, but... if he REALLY cared about her, he wouldn't have had sex with her when he was lying to her, when he was using her as bait for her brother. Yes, yes, Marcus was a bad man. But for whatever reason, he was good to Sarah, and she knew nothing about his other life. Marcus was her only rock, her only anchor, and he protected her fiercely, even killing a man who hurt her. When someone has survived rape, trust is... a hard thing. To lie to Sarah, to use her and make her trust you, and then have sex with her because you think you love her... that's fucked up. Beyond fucked up. And from that point forward, I just really had a problem with the book. Because in my mind, nothing Garrett could ever, EVER, say or do would make up for such a flagrant betrayal of her trust. If he hadn't had sex with her, maybe. But to pretend to be someone he's not, and take advantage of her in that way... nothing could ever make that okay. If he was a decent human being AT ALL, he should have insisted on that step not being taken until the situation was over and he could be honest with her. If he cared about her, wanted to protect her, he wouldn't have done that.

The other books in this series have not had better impressions so I suppose I was expecting to be bummed.I do not much care for this series. I do not like the books so far. The only thing the KGI series has going for it is the characters...And the characters rock!Hidden away is the KGI series story about Garrett and Sarah.Garrett is sent on a mission that brings his agonizing nightmare of a past to life. He is forced to protect a woman...the half sister of the traitorous man who changed Garrett's life. Sent on the \"bullshit\" mission, he's forced to lounge on a beach, fish and drink beer all day. Doesn't sound too bad, right? Well then you throw in the babbling and terrified woman he is to protect and I suppose things get a little interesting. If she'd witnessed a murder, it wasn't all that had happened. Someone had hurt her or scared the hell out of her, and it enraged him. Yeah, she was a job and he took each and every job seriously. But the surge of protectiveness he felt whenever he looked at this scared, fragile woman went beyond that of a job. And he was at a loss to explain it.Sarah witnessed her brother murder a man she shared a past with. Although she felt no remorse from the man's death, she fears what will happen to her brother if the authorities realizes his involvement. She's on the run and of course bumps into Garrett on their little island of not so paradise.She laughed. She couldn't help it. Her shoulders shook and she looked down and laughed all over again.\"What the hell is so funny?\" he demanded. \"Definitely not good for a man's ego when a woman looks at his dick and laughs.\"I had to read 60% of this book for something interesting to happen. 60%.

The only part that held my interest was the hilarious banter between Garrett and Van. I also have some very serious issues with Garret over-protectiveness towards his sisters-in-law. It just bugged me that he had this constant worries about Rachel and Sophie back home every five minutes. I get that he was a compassionate and watchful man, but geez lewis Garrett, enough all ready.

The second novel that came out entitled No Place to Run was equally intense as it was emotional and since then I have been on tenterhooks waiting for the release day of Hidden Away which features the story of the broody and hot as sin Garrett Kelly.My fascination for anything to do with Garrett started with the 1st book itself where he and his brother Ethan\u2019s wife Rachel share a very close bond with each other. Though Garrett tends to growl and snarl at the rest of them coming off as the grouchiest and most anti-social brother in the family, it is the complete transformation that he undergoes whenever Rachel is around and needing him that made his character such an intriguing one. And Sam\u2019s story just made Garrett seem more appealing because Garrett at first dislikes Sophie so much but nevertheless ends up taking a bullet for the woman his brother loves.Garrett is the second eldest of the 5 Kelly brothers though his worrisome nature and overprotective tendencies makes him seem older than the rest of the brothers. Garrett too had served as his country as a soldier until six years back a mission which he led his group on had gone horribly wrong killing two of his team mates requiring his brothers to pick up the pieces. What Garrett would like more than anything else is to take his own sweet revenge on the man who double-crossed his team on that fateful mission, the chance to do so which comes unexpectedly through their CIA contact requiring Garrett to fly all the way to the small island of Isle de Bijoux where his mission awaits him.Sarah Daniels is a woman who is on the run to protect the only man who has ever given a damn about her and tried to serve as her protector and savior in the only way he had deemed as fit. A year back, Sarah\u2019s life had taken a horrible turn which had rendered her helpless and fearful of every man she encounters afterwards and it is with this fear still lurking in the depths of her soul that she runs to seek refuge in the serenity of the white sandy beaches and the deep blue sea that surrounds Isle de Bijoux.When Garrett gets up close and personal with his mission, it takes only a couple of seconds for him to realize that there is so much more than that meets the eye where Sarah is concerned. The helpless fear that he sees in Sarah\u2019s eyes makes Garrett\u2019s blood boil and invokes the urge to do harm to whoever had inflicted such wounds on Sarah. Whilst the growing feelings of possessiveness and protectiveness about Sarah befuddle him, that doesn\u2019t stop Garrett from doing what he does best; engulf the woman he loves in his protective warmth which is just damn near enough to make any woman sigh and flutter over the whole thing.With unknown enemies on Sarah\u2019s trail, Garrett\u2019s job is a double hard one and it certainly doesn\u2019t make things easier for him when he has to lie to the one woman who he wants unwavering trust and faith from. Once again, the whole of Kelly family makes an appearance together with the other team members who make this series so very appealing. Though the incidents of the heart thumping variety did not happen as much as it did in the 2nd book, Hidden Away too serves up on all the aspects which makes the book 3 of the KGI series a decent addition to an already 5-star rated series.Couple of things I loved that I want to mention in my review. First of all, yes you ladies guessed it right, who wouldn\u2019t love that drool-inducing cover featuring the hot as sin Garrett Kelly? I love the covers of each and every KGI novel that has come out and this one\u2019s no exception to that rule.Revisiting the characters from the Kelly bunch as well the rest of the characters that makes this series a kick-ass one is always a plus point in my opinion. It is heartwarming to see Ethan and Rachel making their way and their marriage growing stronger day by day whilst Sophie and Sam have a cute new addition to their family making things just perfect for this story. And let me not forget Rusty who I think is going to end up being my favorite character, if Maya Banks ever gets round to telling her story.And needless to say, I loved both Sarah and Garrett and found Sarah\u2019s courage and loyalty humbling which earned her my admiration in spades. Though the author does not go into details of her gruesome encounter, the fear and total humiliation that she must have gone through is totally understood which made my heart just bleed for her.But with all those things that I did love, I did find myself a bit disappointed with how Garrett\u2019s character turned out in the end. I was expecting a bit more brooding and tortured hotness from him which ALWAYS has me predictably swooning into a puddle right next to my Kindle. And based on how Garrett is perceived by the rest of his family, I wanted some of that to come out in his own book which failed to appear and instead his soft and overprotective side which I love nevertheless took the center stage. Though for someone else that might not be a peeve, I found myself feeling just a teeny weeny bit letdown because of that.All in all, an enjoyable addition to the KGI series, and I can\u2019t wait to find out who gets their story told next from the delectable group of characters that Maya has created in this wonderful series. If you haven\u2019t already read the KGI series, do start from book 1 because you need to experience the Kelly bunch right from the very beginning to fully appreciate each and every character as they unfold and grow with every story.For the review with quotes: http://bit.ly/idnkdoReviewer's note: After pondering much about the story and why this just didn't come down as a highly satisfying read for me, I have brought down its rating from 4 to 3.5 stars because Garrett and Sarah just didn't get enough time of their own in the story to make this one a magical reading experience. There were times I wished that the book would pick up pace because that's what I have been accustomed to throughout the series. And Garrett's character ended up being the total opposite of what he started out being from the start of the series which has made me re-think and then re-rate the book. I think I must have been too sleep deprived when I first rated and reviewed the book."}, {"userName": "Willow Brook", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2414879-willow-brook", "userReview": "Another enjoyable installment in the KGI series about the formidable Kelly brothers, though this one had enough things that bugged me to make it my least favorite book so far. My biggest issue was the heroine, Sarah. From the get-go, when she is described as having acquaintances but no close friends, I was shaking my head. Maybe because I just spent the past month not being able to spend time with my closest friends and it was driving me a little batty. I get that she was a foster child and has issues, but she's a grown woman now and you'd think she would have figured out how to make a friend or two. She was too much the fragile victim for my taste, though obviously it worked well for the hero, Garrett, LOL. I did enjoy him, a grumpy tough guy who is a marshmallow inside when it comes to women, going into instant rescue mode. He was very sweet and considerate with Sarah who had some rough stuff to get over. The story involves Sarah on the run because she witnesses her brother Marcus, her only family/support person committing a crime and does not want to be used against him. Turns out her bro is one nasty piece of work and she is the only person he has ever truly cared about (must be genetic). Many people want to take out Marcus, including Garrett for very personal reasons. His desire for revenge coincides with a request from the CIA that he keep an eye on Sarah to see if Marcus shows up where she is staying. So he hangs out at the same tropical island where Sarah is hiding and they find themselves drawn to each other. Garrett immediately wants to rescue, care for and protect fragile, haunted Sarah and she likes that just fine. The tricky part is he also wants to kill the one person she is close to and he must lie to her while trying to draw Marcus out and keep her safe from others who want to use and even kill her. So that was certainly a hurdle for our young lovers to overcome on their way to a HEA.Interspersed through the story are scenes with the large Kelly family and it was nice to see them all again. Despite my carping about Sarah (and I could go on, I'm just short on time ), I enjoyed the story, found Garret very tender and sweet and had fun catching up with the various Kellys. A fun series. I look forward to the next installment, hopefully with a heroine who has a little more backbone and smaller tear ducts."}, {"userName": "Saly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3192922-saly", "userReview": "Ok so I loved the first book in the series and the 2nd one was meh but this one blew my mind. Garret was such a great hero and so huggable ;)Sarah..I liked here even though maybe I didn't want to because she was such a victim but what really made me like her was that she was real, her fear, her emotions everything. She was just trying to make the best of what life had dealt her. And I liked Marcus..I know he was the villain and all but no matter what he loved his sister and risked everything for her. Sarah loved her brother, faults and all and I am glad she didn't flip on him and that her love was real.And I fell in love with Kelly family all over again. Van is Van and he deserves a book, and Rio and Cole and PJ?and ok what the heck everyone!!Rusty is someone I still don't gush over but she is okay I guess. What is up with Sean and her I wonder, or is it something that only I felt?Maybe a friendship of sorts?And Sam is still my least favorite.

Which is too bad because I really liked the first one. I think the plot was too formulaic. After awhile you just knew what was going to happen so it didn't seem worth it to keep on. The whole business with him having lied to her about working for her brother was an example. You didn't even have to wonder 'hmm how's that going to turn out?' No suprises in the plot really. Darn you just never can tell with Maya Banks. She's very hit or miss for me.

This means there isn't an awful lot of steam in this book but I think that is understandable considering Sarah's past and had Ms Banks written any sex scenes earlier in the story it wouldn't have been/felt right.Whilst Garrett is watching and keeping tracks on her he realises that she is scared and skittish and looks after her including doing a really lovely thing such as going to collect the books that she dropped (As some guy tried to mug her!), get her a bottle of wine (she previously admitted that is all she drinks) and a bar of chocolate as he thinks that all women love chocolate (not wrong there then ha ha). He leaves these items on her doorstep for her to find when she wakes up - it was at this point that I knew that I did love Garrett and I am sure that most everyone who reads this story will say the same.As in all HEA's Garrett gets his woman after a bit of a rocky fallout when she finds out that he has been lying to her. I did feel that the last few scenes were rushed and that she gave in and forgave him far too quickly considering the outcome with her brother!I have rated this as 4.5 stars and would have happily given a 5 star if the suspense side had been stronger but having said that I still really loved this book and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.Hurry up Ms Banks....I cannot wait until the next installment!"}, {"userName": "Jonel Boyko", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15432163-jonel-boyko", "userReview": "Banks returns readers to the world of the KGI with just the right mix of sweet and spice. Suspense runs high as the characters travel throughout Central and North America. Banks\u2019 descriptions bring each new locale to life so that I could easily picture them. The story seemed so real to me throughout. The action packed sequences were interspersed with heartfelt moments and family drama keeping me on my toes.Garrett\u2019s personality had me from the get-go. He was so strong and appeared fearless, yet his world was completely rocked by Sarah. Sarah\u2019s need to protect those she cared about, regardless of her own fear tugged at my heart. Together, these two were a fantastic pair who easily carried the story forward. I also appreciated the fact that the Kellys made a strong appearance in the tale. This family is so tight knit, and yet they each have their own lives to deal with. The Rio/Steele dynamic brought the entire KGI crew into the story in a bigger way for me. I enjoyed seeing the interaction and tension between the two teams, yet their ability to also work together.This novel is formulaic in as much as boy meets girl, boy (eventually) gets girl, but from their Banks makes it all her own. It was a fun addition to the series and also a fantastic read in and of itself."}, {"userName": "Fanny", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23899791-fanny", "userReview": "Hidden Away es el tercer libro de la serie KGI, creada por Maya Banks y narra la historia de Garrett y Sarah.Este tercer libro tiene una progresion mas lenta, mientras que la historia de Sam empezaba muy rapido y estaba llena de accion desde el principio, Hidden Away tiene un ritmo mas pausado y da la sensacion de que le cuesta un poco arrancar pero cuando llegas a la mitad hay tanta accion que te da miedo parpadear por si te pierdes algo.Aun me quedan bastantes libros de esta saga pero ahora mismo pienso que esta tercera novela es especial, mucho mas sentimental que las anteriores, quizas por todo lo que tuvo que sufrir Sarah en su pasado o quizas porque logre conectar mucho mas con Garrett y Sarah que con los protagonistas anteriores.Dulce, tierna, romantica y sin dejar de lado la accion y el suspence, Hidden Away es una lectura que recomiendo a todo el mundo.4 Estrellas!!"}, {"userName": "Crystal~BIG book addict~", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7270157-crystal-big-book-addict", "userReview": "3.5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Crystal \u2665 RBtWBC", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4118350-crystal-rbtwbc", "userReview": "My favorite of the series so far!Series Review, Books #1-3The Kelly/KGI Series is a dark and sinfully sexy romantic suspense series that centers on a tight-knit military family, the Kelly\u2019s. There are six Kelly brothers, all of whom served in different branches of the military and together form a special private security agency called the Kelly Group International, which take on the missions that even the government can\u2019t handle. These brothers are hard-bodied, sexy alpha males that will have you swooning in no time; and with each book featuring a brother\u2019s own HEA you receive plenty of danger, sex and a roller coaster of emotions when these sensuous military men must fight for the women they loveThe first book in the series, The Darkest Hour, centers on one of the younger Kelly brothers, Ethan Kelly. Ethan is an ex-Navy Seal grieving for the wife he lost a year ago. When he receives an anonymous package on the one year anniversary of her death, claiming that Rachel is really alive Ethan will do anything to find her and keep her, even if that means raiding a drug cartel\u2019s camp in the middle of the jungle. The Darkest Hour is an emotionally intense novel all about second chances; with plenty of scorching hot romance, action and subterfuge that makes for edge of your seat perfection with a sizzling main couple and a dynamic cast of secondary characters. No Place to Run continues the series with the eldest of the Kelly bothers, Sam. Being the oldest, Sam is extremely protective of his family and takes his responsibility over the whole Kelly crew very seriously. When a woman from his past washes up in his lake though, his protective instincts rise to a whole new level. On the run from her family, Sophie Lundgren\u2019s only hope for her and the life of her unborn child is Sam, her baby\u2019s father. Swift moving and heart stopping, No Place to Run is sexually charged and full of excitement providing non-stop entertainment as a superb addition to the series.Hidden Away is the latest book in the KGI series and my favorite so far, centering on the second eldest Kelly brother, Garrett Kelly who insists on being on each mission and protecting his brother\u2019s backs. After being injured on his last assignment though, taking a bullet for his newest sister-in-law, Garrett is forced into some down time. However an all-expense paid beach vacation courtesy of the US government isn\u2019t so bad, especially since all he has to do is keep an eye on the lovely Sarah Daniels, who after witnessing a murder committed by her brother is in hiding. The possible capture of her murdering brother who Garrett holds a personal grudge against is just a bonus. As he gets closer to Sarah though and the more he learns about her the more he respects her and starts to fall for her. But when Sarah is caught in the middle of the only two men she has ever loved which one will she choose? Gripping, sizzling and breathtaking, Maya Banks weaves a riveting story of heart break, intrigue and trust. Banks delivers one hell of a ride with Hidden Away and I was enthralled from the first page. The first love scene was so intense, I didn\u2019t even realize that I was holding my breath until it puffed out when he finally shouted her name! These are my first Maya Banks reads and they will definitely not be my last! If you like contemporary romance, romantic suspense or even just plain old suspense novels then I recommend her KGI\u2019s to you. I cannot wait for the next addition to the series, even though it won\u2019t be Donavan\u2019s who I am really looking forward to. Each character in this mind blowing series is smart, sexy and compelling; leaving me craving for more more more! A without-a-doubt, a five-wine glass-must-read series!"}, {"userName": "Noelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3451611-noelle", "userReview": "I've really enjoyed this series, I've read it a bit out of order but it doesn't seem to hurt it any. Sara (h) is on the run and in hiding. After she confesses to her brother ( a very dangerous man who tries to keep her separate from his life of crime) that a man she works for has hurt her horribly, she witnesses her brother murdering him. While she's not sad that this man is dead, she runs so that no one can use her to put her brother away, it's the only way for her to protect him.Garrett (H) has waited a long time to take down the man who killed his team mates and shot him in the leg, now he has his chance. All he had to do was stick close to the mans sister and take him down when he shows up.Sara never thought she would be able to trust a man again in her life let alone want to be close and have a relationship with another one anytime soon. However when she gets to know Garrett all kinds of thoughts enter her head that she never thought she would ever have again. She likes these feelings/thoughts, they make her feel stronger and freer than ever. Garrett never counted on how Sara would make him feel, he would do anything for her and to keep her safe but he still has a job to do and she's going to hate him when he has to take her brother down."}, {"userName": "~KarenH~", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4738105-karenh", "userReview": "I love, love, love this series! The heroes are amazing, and the heroines are strong enough to take care of themselves in most situations, but smart enough to accept help and protection when they need it.

On another day I might choose a different one to be my least favorite! :) The only slight quibble I have about this book is that the ending seems a bit rushed - not horribly, everything is resolved, but it just felt a little abrupt, and seemed like it would have been improved with the addition of a really good epilogue."}, {"userName": "SheLove2Read", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1708674-shelove2read", "userReview": "Garrett!What a wonderful book.
