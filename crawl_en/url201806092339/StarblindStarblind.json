She\u2019s obsessed with all things Earth, even though Earth was destroyed long ago. When she runs across a target that is much harder to catch than usual, she\u2019s intrigued and falls instantly in lust with Ash. There are many steamy scenes, especially since Ash is the definition of hot \u2013 he has another form which is pure flame. I thought this was a fun story, but Jane rubbed me the wrong way. She seemed like a whiney brat who didn\u2019t act much like a resourceful, tough bounty hunter, or a starship captain. I understand that she had a tough life and felt unloved and rejected by those most important to her, but she got on my nerves with some of her antics. She lusts after Ash, and fights against any deeper feelings, while scheming to capture and turn him in. The descriptions of the crew members and other aliens were interesting, but with the way Jane treated her crew, I\u2019m amazed any of them stayed loyal to her. The story was worth reading, but if there are any further adventures that feature Jane Sevis, I\u2019ll probably pass."}, {"userName": "Kristin ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4639765-kristin", "userReview": "I'm giving away an e-copy on my blog.This was so much more than I thought it would be. From the synopsis I thought it was going to be about a woman who contemplates her career because she fell in love. When in reality, that isn't the case at all. Sure, Jane is attracted to Ash but that's about it. She's not about to let a handsome face screw her out of some insane payload. However, she has no idea that her plan to distract him with sex so that she can slap the cuffs on him is a very bad one... and not for obvious reasons. Pretty soon she finds herself mated to the man who the higher-ups really want... and they will do anything to get him. I liked that the author didn't just make the story about Jane and Ash. Jane has a crew on her ship who are always in the picture. They are pretty much her friends and are always there to help her out or give advice when it comes to handling her predicament. I liked that even though this was a spaceship setting, you still get the sense of normalcy as well. Now that's not to say that you forgot that they were on a different planet or in outer space, because you don't. The author took great care in reminding you about the world she created through the characters and their thoughts. Since Jane is half-human (she had her DNA spliced with some other being), she is obsessed with the long forgotten planet Earth and the inhabitants that lived there. Not to mention that the author also incorporated some characters who were clearly that of the alien variety. The romance wasn't that of insta-love which I'm grateful for. However, do to the whole mating thing, there is an attraction there, but Jane is a business woman and contemplates the different ways in which she can capture Ash and turn him in for profit. The fact that the even though the sex wasn't slow building, the actual feelings of love was, and for me that is a big difference. One other thing that I immensely loved about this story is what Ash is. He isn't categorized as what he is when Jane decides to take him down. All she knows is that he's powerful. I was pretty happy with Ash's identity. I'm not gonna say what he is and give it away but lets just say that it's up there with a unicorn when it comes to magical beings. I think what Ash was was by far my favorite thing of the entire story. If you're looking for a steamy galactic suspenseful romance then you have got to give this a try. Even though this is a series, the author doesn't end Starblind with a cliffhanger. You could finish the book and be happy. I, however, will be waiting for the next book to come out to see what happens next for Jane and Ash.Favorite quote...\"I probably should have been running but I was transfixed out of curiosity. I was just hoping it wouldn't be the death of me. After all, I wasn't a cat and I only had one life, so if curiosity killed me... I was screwed.\""}, {"userName": "\u2764 AudiobookRomance \u2764", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1789575-audiobookromance", "userReview": "A page turner, I can\u2019t wait to listen to more! Starblind is #01 of 04 in the  Starblind Series by D.T. Dyllin. All 4 are currently published with 2 of them being on Audible. #3 is in audio production now, with #4 to soon follow. The author has confirmed that #4 is the final book in the series.Ashley Holt narrates the series thus far.\nHEA with no cliffhanger!\nThis series is only 4 books long and is heavily connected by characters and overall story arc so I recommend reading the books in order. It is not only more enjoyable that way, but you will miss out on a lot of details if you read them out of order.\nLength: 6 hrs and 59 mins\nWarning: SEX! Yes, both in thoughts and actions, so if you do not like sex, then you should avoid. Trigger Warnings None that I see.Please let me know if you think there should be. \u2665 Story \u2665 Starblind takes place in the future many years after the original earth was destroyed. On New Earth, being \"just human\" is no longer good enough! Genetic DNA splicing is how babies are made in this new world. When children are old enough, they are tested, rated, and classified by ability.Each book has a different couple as a main focus, but there is so much more to these tales! The characters at the center of the Starblind Series are rebels and dreamers, determined to buck the system of what is expected for what is adventurous.\n\n \"Once upon a time humans thought they were alone in the Universe.....They were wrong.\"\n \n Jane Sevis\n Jane is a Hybrid Human and the owner and captain of The Pittsburgh. Her personality is snarky, rude, impulsive, and totally works for her chosen profession as a bounty hunter. The story starts with Jane in pursuit of one of those bounties, which goes wrong quickly.Jane wants a fresh start and to be something more than what the tests say she can be. She tested out as a normal human, Species Class 1 out of 4. Most are expected to be Class 2 or 3, so this didn\u2019t leave her many options, friends, or family on New Earth. That's Harsh! So much for unconditional love in the future!\n\n \"I wasn\u2019t a cat and I only had one life, so if curiosity killed me \u2026 I was screwed.\"\n \nAsh \nAsh is Species Class 4, and you will have to listen for yourself to find out what makes him so special! He is the fly in Jane's ointment when it comes to her bounties. His level of snark and mischief give Jane's a run for their money! Ash knows there are secrets to be had when it comes to Jane, even if she doesn\u2019t know them herself. The interactions between these 2 are hot and angsty.\n\n \n The Pittsburgh is basically the headquarters of the story. It has become home for Janeand her 3 crew members. Zula, Jane's #2, is a Galvraron which are known for their high IQs. Tamzea, ship medic, is a Mazatimz which are known for their empathic and healing abilities. Masha, ship engineer, is a Guaviva which are known for their ability to \u2018speak\u2019 to anything electronic.Each of these females are also looking for a do-over and have sorted histories of their own. All of which I look forward to learning as the series continues.\n\n \u201cWell, I might as well tell everyone since I apparently can\u2019t have any secrets around here.\u201d\n The Starblind series is a page turner and I can't wait to listen to the next in the series, Parallax (Tamzea's story). I can't really comment more without spoiling something.

But when she runs into Ash during a routine bounty collection, he ruins everything! When she finds out that he is actually wanted as well, she makes it her mission to capture him, even if she desires him physically as well. A girl can have her fun and work too, right?\n\n\nI have been wanting to read a D.T. Dyllin book for forever, pretty much all of hers are sitting on my wishlist just waiting for me to get. When I had the chance to read a book by her that featured an all girl space-pirateish adventure, the answer was Heck Yeah ! I really liked the world and the idea of intergalactic bounty hunters and tons of cool alien species, (phoenixes are so cool!) as well as the dynamic between the women in the crew and the habits of the species.\n\n\nI did find the story to be too much tell me and not enough show me for my liking, though. I would have preferred that the author let me see all the cool stuff that was apparently happening, but instead I was told about it by Jane after it happened in a brief synopsis- I guess this is a great way to keep the book shorter, but it caused me to be disconnected more from the story than I would have liked. \u200bThe narrator was a little slow for my liking but when I sped up the speed to 1.5X I really ended up enjoying the narration and audiobook experience\u200b. She enunciated clearly so I could always understand her and she tried to give all the secondary characters their own voices, which is the may to my heart for narrators. I feel like she perfectly embodied Jane though, with her exasperation, bravado, snippish attitude and lust- the perfect choice for the moody, brazen captain.\n\n\nThis story wrapped up fairly nicely so I was surprised that this was a series. I ended up looking up the rest of the books in the series was was pleasantly surprised that each book is about a romance space adventure about a different crew member. I love that these are basically independent, standalone stories set in the same world- you can just pick one that sounds good and do. The books are really fast reads, full of fun characters, great world building and some hot sex. I look forward to more from this world and the other alien species. \u200bI received this audiobook as part of my participation in a blog tour with Audiobookworm Promotions.

Jane is the captain of her own starship, she makes money by being a bounty hunter. Jane is brash, selfish, snarky and boisterous, but she's also tough, relatable, and uses her bravado to keep emotional distant from people. The people who were suppose to love Jane treated her horribly, so she's a bit jaded and doesn't want to be vulnerable to anyone. Jane ends up making very bad decisions because of her desire to keep up her badass image. Jane comes across a bounty she can't catch and feels drawn to. Ash is a mysterious, sexy guy, who is also brash and has much bravado. These characters did get on my nerves a bit, but I still found myself liking them. There's lots of adventure, and I loved that there's different types of aliens. I was a bit surprised at how detailed the sex scenes are, but I don't mind that, so it was all good with me. I enjoyed the romance, and it had it's moments of sweetness, but I would've loved a little bit more vulnerability between Ash and Jane. Still enjoyed the connection between them though, and I enjoyed Ash's origins. Jane's origins are also a bit of a mystery. I enjoyed the suspense elements, and seeing Jane grow some. Jane gets rude awakening when her bad decisions catch up with her. This story is mainly for a fun adventure, which it is! I listened to the audio version of this story, and the narrator did a good job. There were a couple of weird pauses, but I enjoyed the listening experience! Look forward to the next book! There's still more to be done!"}, {"userName": "Lelia Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6089004-lelia-taylor", "userReview": "In a world where humans as we know them no longer exist, everyone is a hybrid of some sort but Jane still exhibits all the traits we see today so humanity isn't totally forgotten. Jane is a bounty hunter in space, always an adventurous setting for a science fiction story. While I like her, she's a little on the rough side and, sometimes, I had the impression she had sex on the mind 24/7. Still, her sort of devil-may-care attitude suited her bounty hunting life and I enjoyed her interactions with others, particularly her three-woman crew. When she's confronted with the possibility of actually liking her latest target, a Phoenix named Ash, Jane will have to re-think a few things.This book has quite a bit of the aforementioned sex, in thought and deed, and the language is frequently saltier than I like but the really good worldbuilding and lively plot kept me engaged despite those things I could do without. As for the narration, I'm of two minds. Ms. Holt speaks clearly, which I certainly appreciate, but her cadence is a little odd and its slowness made me want to yell out \"spit it out for heaven's sake\". I finally hit the speed up function on my iPod and that helped. On the other hand, her voice seems just right for Jane. Moving on now to Book #2, Parallax, and I'm looking forward to it."}, {"userName": "The Book Junkie Reads . . .", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377888-the-book-junkie-reads", "userReview": "The Book Junkie Reads . . .

There are elements I'm familiar with, it's based in a space aged era, there are cyborgs (but not human cyborgs, humans have had their genes spliced with other beings to create humans with special abilities. This all combines in an interesting way to create a story that had me always wondering what would happen next.Jane is very quick to jump in and act which lands her in some interesting situations.Ash if more of a planner, but he doesn't seem to like telling Jane what the plan in, queue tension and interesting situations.There's plenty of plot twists and revelations that keep things interesting.I wasn't a fan of the narration, the phrasing was disjointed with pauses in places that interrupted the flow of the story... repeatedly. I had a really tough time telling what arts were thoughts and what was speech from Jane. At times I couldn't tell which character was speaking, the voices were hard to tell a part.

When she opened/introduced the book, I got a little worried I wouldn't enjoy the book as much. If anyone else had narrated this book, it would have been a different experience.

In this universe Jane Sevis, a bounty hunter, is looking for a place to belong. Missing an Earth she never knew, she surrounds herself with old antics from a no longer existing planet.Jane\u2019s life changes when she meets Ash, altering her and her crew destination. Attracted to him on a primal level she has to decide either hand him over or give in to the attraction. Duty and passion will mix only to unravel well hidden secrets not only about her but about the system ruling the universe.As every book by D.T. Dyllin this one is a wild ride where there's no rest. Action kicks in every time we turn to the next page, passion and tension is always present when the main couple is together. And every time you think you figure something out the author comes and blows your mind with a new surprise.Jane is the kind of heroin we are accustomed from Dara, she is stubborn, fearless, strong but also vulnerable. She is loyal to her friends and it's not afraid to fight for what she thinks is right.I really liked the universe created by the author. The different species are well described, the ships and the space travel is believable. I'm a sci-fi fan and I loved it! Another thing I liked was the role given to sex. Usually sex scenes are built upon tension and they are something you start to wait. This is not a bad thing but when you start to anticipate the heated scenes you might forget about the story. Here sex is just something that happens, and I really think it was smart. This is a sci-fi romance with sex on it and it is used as a resource that helps characters get closer and bond in a more intimate way.Starblind is really exciting, funny and entertaining.

She has a huge love for Earth items, though she may be a little misguided about what passes for Earth fashions, but in a world where Earth no longer exists who can blame her.

Jane's friends, her crew, are all different species, all with their own abilities, features and personalities.
