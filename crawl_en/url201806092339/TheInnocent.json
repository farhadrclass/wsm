This fell short somewhere along the road, I felt it meandered and I was not drawn in. Our protag had spent some time in gaol, served his time and was attempting to redeem his life. This was not meant to be, and thus starts a cat and mouse chase involving his lovely wife.Harlan Coben plays around with nattation styles here, but the only redeeming quality for me was the narrator in my audio version, the voice was menacing and I felt a lot was in store. The use of second person narrative at the end added another menacing touch, but it didn't deliver for me as a whole. This author is one that I will read no matter what, so I don't really mind that he may churn out the occasional dud, I always look forward to many more from him.

You are tired of your series character and you have a contract to deliver a book. You decide to write a stand alone book about a guy who can't become a lawyer because he killed some guy at a fraternity party. So your character becomes a paralegal whose practice is only eclipsed by Danny Devito playing Deck Shifflet, the \"paralawyer\" in The Rainmaker.You aren't a lawyer so you don't know how utterly improbable this is. Your character marries a wonderful girl, who has a past worse than your protagonist. You offer lots of plot twists, but with fifty pages to go and the bad guys dead, you don't use them up. So you spend fifty pages showing off how clever you are.You are so clever that you try to write the book in second person, present tense. Your editor stops you, but you manage to open and close it in the second person. In the middle you write third person past tense from differing points of view. You consider yourself daring. Others are just annoyed at your waste of talent and waste of their time.

(I have now read them all except one of the out-of-print ones). I won't rehash the plot, you can get that elsewhere. What I will say is that I love the way in which Coben keeps up the momentum.Unlike some authors, he doesn't save up his twists for the end, he scatters them liberally throughout the book. Nearly every chapter ends with a surprise, keeping the reader waiting until he returns to it later. He uses this cliff-hanger/cutaway approach to very good effect. And he still manages a big twist at the end (although I had a vague sense that it was coming).As one who has been heavily influenced by Coben's style, I can say that he is the master of the lostinabook style."}, {"userName": "Aditi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16069171-aditi", "userReview": "\u201cThe best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.\u201d  ----Marcus AureliusHarlan Coben, an international bestselling author, has penned a hypnotizing crime thriller, The Innocent in which the author has spun a tale about an ex-con whose after prison life has turned out to be surprisingly good, but unfortunately his dream life threatens to come crashing down when a video featuring his wife is sent to his phone by his wife, and parallely, one murder occurs after another and young cop is trying to connecting the dots of these murders while another teenager tries to dig up the past of her murdered mother and must punish her killers.Synopsis: The horror of one night is forever etched in Matt Hunter\u2019s memory: the night he innocently tried to break up a fight\u2014and ended up a killer. Now, nine years after his release from prison, his innocence long forgotten, he\u2019s an ex-con who takes nothing for granted. With his wife, Olivia, pregnant and the two of them closing on a house in his home town, things are looking up. Until the day Matt gets a shocking, inexplicable video call from Olivia\u2019s phone. And in an instant, the unraveling begins.A mysterious man who begins tailing Matt turns up dead. A beloved nun is murdered. And local and federal authorities--including homicide investigator, Loren Muse, a childhood schoolmate of Matt\u2019s with a troubled past of her own-- see all signs pointing to a former criminal with one murder already under his belt: Matt Hunter. Unwilling to lose everything for a second time, Matt and Olivia are forced outside the law in a desperate attempt to save their future together.An electrifying thrill-ride of a novel that peeks behind the white picket fences of suburbia, THE INNOCENT is at once a twisting, turning, emotionally-charged story, and a compelling tale of the choices we make and the repercussions that never leave us. Matt Hunter, the most unfortunate man, whose simple idea to save his friend from getting beaten up by some rowdy boys, lands him up in a prison, thereby forcing him to kiss goodbye to his average life and goals. Whereas Matt's post-prison life treats him well, as he lands up a job in his late elder brother's firm and says his marital vows to a wonderful person like Olivia, who eventually becomes pregnant. But all of a sudden, it seems that bad luck won't stop following Matt, when an unpleasant video makes a way to his phone straight from his wife's number, followed by a phone call from the man who claims indecent things about his wife's current whereabouts. Shocked Matt pledges to find the truth as well as the identity of the strange man with the help of a private detective. While on the background, a teenager is looking for her mother's old life, who has been murdered by a cruel man and wants to bring justice to her killer and a female homicide cop with a distasteful past is investigating the murder of a nun with silicon breasts. While Matt, on the other hand, must keep him safe to unravel the brain twisting puzzle that his wife, Olivia laid out for him.Harlan Coben manages to hit bull's eye with this particular book, where the plot thickens along with the intensity of the mystery, reading which the readers are bound to feel that edgy tension that will grasp them by their minds, souls and hearts. This book is spine chillingly addictive and highly absorbing, and right from the very first page, I was sucked right into the depth of the story line, and could not let myself get out from that rush of this story. The book is a must read for one and all, be the reader a crime thriller fan or not, but one must grab a copy of this book for sure, as the story not only unravels with a mystery but also with the best of human emotions and twists that will leave the readers anxious as well as surprised to their very core till the very end. The chapters end with a complex challenge that will beg the readers to turn the next page and so on. The author's writing is something, as the author has penned in an arresting manner and it felt like the author knows how to lure his readers into such an engrossing thriller. The narrative is both sentimental and appealing enough to make the readers stick to the pages of this book like a moth stuck on a glowing light bulb. The pacing is extremely fast and the whole story unravels at the speed of some unpredictably wild tornado although it feels deeply satisfying after experiencing Corben's tornado, meaning the book! There are so many layers and unpredictable twists that come out of nowhere that will make the readers feel like getting slapped real hard right on their face all-of-a-sudden, although that slap feels good and fits perfectly with the mood and the flow of the story line. The author keeps major plot-twisters till the climax that is bound to throw the readers off the edges of their seats. The mystery reads like a roller coaster ride filled with full of anticipative moments and adrenaline rushing scenes. The pace of the revelation of the truth is smooth and will occur gradually through the backstories and only after the readers are well accustomed with the story line. The characters shine like a gem through their flaws, strength and humanity. The characters are real to their very core and will constantly make the readers comprehend with their demeanor. The main character, Matt is an excellent character, who has flaws yet manages to be a lead an ideal life style despite of the scars in his character certificate. Matt's back story shapes him up into a thoughtful human being and so the readers will easily be able to connect with him. His journey and his investigation will keep the readers rooted till the very end. In a nutshell, this is an enthralling book with a mystery so well concocted that even the seasoned crime readers can't be able to figure out the major twists and will eventually be left fooled by the innocent characters. Verdict:  One heck of a page turning thriller!"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "Matt Hunter is doing fine until he accidentally kills a fellow college student during a drunken brawl and goes to prison for 4 years. Now, 9 years after his release Matt is happily married to Olivia, expecting a baby, working as a paralegal, and looking to buy a house in his New Jersey home town. He's also a big support to his sister-in-law Marsha and his nephews since his brother recently died. And then Matt's life starts to unravel. A mysterious nun - with ties to Las Vegas - is murdered, and it's found she recently made a phone call to Marsha's house. While Olivia is at a conference in Boston Matt receives photos from her phone showing her dressed as a hooker in the company of a black-haired man, but Olivia denies everything. Matt tracks down the black-haired man - also from Las Vegas - who soon turns up dead. As the dead bodies pile up local investigators as well as FBI agents from Las Vegas look to Matt, the ex-con, as a likely suspect. Determined not to go back to prison Matt embarks on his own investigation, but everyone in this story has secrets to keep and Matt and his family are soon in danger. There are a lot of characters in the book - parents, thugs, strippers, law enforcement agents, private detectives, family, friends, etc. - which can be confusing, but most are decently enough developed. And the story is a page-turner as we go from the quiet streets of the suburbs to the roiling sex clubs of Las Vegas. Some of the twists in the story are telegraphed but I didn't anticipate all the surprises toward the end.

I loved the whole plot and idea of the story. We start out with our main character Matt and see how he nearly destroys his life as a young man and we watch how he tries to make something better of himself despite the odds. And then he gets thrown into a whole new mystery.There is a big cast of characters and it takes a bit to familiarize yourself with all of them. But once you do they begin to unfold a bit more becoming a bit more realistic. I feel like Coben can create a mean character and I love that. There were a few I loved and a few I hated as well. But I won't get into that in this review so as not to give away too much.The flow of the story was phenomenal from the prologue to the epilogue. I was completely consumed right from the start. And the twists in the story were excellent IMO. So for a first read it was really good. I look forward to many more Coben books in the future."}, {"userName": "Corey", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12949855-corey", "userReview": "Once again, a fast-paced edge of your seat thriller by Coben! The Innocent is about an ex-con named Matt Hunter who accidentally killed a man while trying to break up a fight. Now many years later he's released from prison and starting a new life, working as a paralegal at a law firm, he marries the love of his life, Olivia, and they're expecting their first child. But he finds out later that his wife doesn't seem to be exactly who she says she is, he receives a strange video on his cell phone on a woman who appears to be his wife. So Matt takes matters into his own hands to find out about Olivia's dark past. For a while some of the characters you might consider minor characters, but as the book progresses you'll say to yourself, I should have paid more attention to that character!

Not a bad book by any means, but having got to the end I'm still not one hundred percent clear on what happened. There were an awful lot of people, an awful lot of interwoven motives, and the result was like a seriously bad knot on my six year old's shoelaces that I can't seem to unpick. Also, I had difficulty swallowing the central change-of-identity...the complete personality and life change felt unlikely, somehow. On the other hand, Coben writes extremely well - the book is easy to read, full of interesting characters, and great dialogue. The action starts straight away and keeps going throughout. Some sections definitely had me on the edge of my seat. If I have a criticism on style, it's that many of the male law-enforcement characters seemed rather similar, becoming one amorphous mass of paunchy middle-aged wisecracking world-weary smugness (at least in my head).

I had been hearing for months about how amazing Harlan Coben is, and I was able to get my hands on this novel at a used book sale. So I bought it and I really enjoyed it, for the most part. The novel follows a man named Matt Hunter. He's had a rough past, even spending some time in prison. And one day, all of a sudden his world begins to fall apart. He gets a text message of a video of what appears to be his wife, in a hotel room with another man. After he gets the text a series of events follows, with twists and turns you wouldn't believe. Something in me, just couldn't quite give this 5 stars. I think maybe it was the fact I didn't connect to the characters. I wanted to know the ending, but I wasn't in a rush. Although I will say the twists and turns really do keep you on your toes. The thing I especially loved about this novel was all the perspectives and the world building. Coben does a fantastic job at giving you two completely different worlds and somehow weaving them together. I really enjoy that.

I had to finish it for book club! My head is still spinning trying to untangle the web and keep all the characters straight. Obviously written by a guy, with the storyline being about a hooker in Vegas, a macho frat house fight, and the clue to the unravelling is the serial number on the deceased woman's breast implants. I was on board with the whole story, until the end when you find out who Olivia's daughter is that she gave up for adoption at birth.

The easy prose helps with this easy read. There were parts in this book where I needed to revisit earlier sections to fully connect with what had been written. There were times when reading later on I though I have read about this before and flicked back. This I think is a product of the excellent writing. There were constant twists through out the book. At times I thought I knew where the story was going but I have to say that I was already wrong. The book includes several characters but these are well written and developed. At no time do you lose connection with the characters and wonder who they are. There are several parts through out however that you don't know who to trust and who not to. This is mirrored in the opinions of the lead characters life as well. Both the prologue and the epilogue are written in a first person manner which puts you into the book. This symmetry between the start and the end of the book is a lovely twist in my opinion. The other twist I loved was for the die hard Harlan Coben fans there is a rather cheeky reference to his Myron Bolitar books.Altogether this is a well written exciting book.

It moves along at a good clip, and when you think you might know what is going on, well, --you don't. Just the kind of novel we like. If you start this (and you should if you like suspense and intrigue) hang on, it's convoluted but intriguing story-telling from one of the masters in his genre. What I like about his writing is that the doesn't just wait for a bang-up ending, he gives the reader these little gems of information all through the book, making you want to know more. It's almost like going through a maze, but not in a way you can't follow. Matt Hunter is a really good guy who got a raw deal when he was in college. When he stepped in to break up a fight where his best friend was getting plummeted, he succeeds, but at what cost? He ends up being charged for murder and sent to prison. The first of many raw breaks for Matt. The story line is captivating, and the characters (there are many) are complex but realistic. Hard to put this one down. Glad to have read it again.

Why can I not put the book down? Why is it so great? The answer is that it's not. I thought it was a very mediocre book-- but, much like The Da Vinci Code by  Dan Brown, the pacing is such that you just never want to stop reading.
