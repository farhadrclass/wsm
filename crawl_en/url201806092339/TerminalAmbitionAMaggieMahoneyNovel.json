When I first started reading the book I was overwhelmed by the amount of important characters. However, the more I read the easier it was to keep track of them because they were all very well developed. Maggie is a successful lawyer and partner of one of the top Wall Street law firms. She has just lost her husband to a terrible accident and her best client for the same reason. She begins looking for new clients when the chairman, Andy Anderson, asks her to be a part of a committee to find out if women are being sexually harassed in the workplace. At first Maggie despises the task of interviewing women about harassment in the workplace. That is until she finds out just how many women are having trouble with the male partners at the firm. As Maggie digs deeper into the troubles of the women she begins to doubt that Andy is looking into these incidents for the right reasons. Initially Maggie tries to help the women but still ends up siding with the firm. However, when she walks in on a shocking incident where a partner is literally caught with his pants down she begins to wonder if her big law firm is all it's cracked up to be. Maggie desperately tries to find out what Andy's motives are while trying to help the women in the firm. She's knows she's running out of time when Andy is nominated for Attorney General. But just when she thinks she might lose the battle Maggie learns something interesting that may blow the entire coverup out of the water. I found Maggie to be a strong, confident woman who had a good head on her shoulders. She was a believable character because while she wanted to help the women at her firm she kept thinking of her job first. Maggie does begin to change her mind and her ways after speaking with the women and seeing just how arrogant and selfish the male partners can be. I also found the underlying message about women's rights to be important but not over the top. It's a prevalent topic that led to a lot of conversations between me and some of my female friends. This book is well written and keeps the reader engaged until the very end. More and more details come out in each chapter so I kept wanting to read more. There were a few side stories involved in the book which also kept me interested.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Todd Fonseca", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1494176-todd-fonseca", "userReview": "Terminal Ambition - A Shocking tale of Discrimination and HarassmentAuthor: Kate McGuinnessRating: 4 of 5Format: Kindle, PaperbackAfter the tragic death of her husband, Maggie Mahoney learns that her once firm position as partner at the law firm her and her late husband practiced at, is now much more tenuous. Manipulated into participating on the firms new \"gender equity committee\", Maggie learns the shocking truth of the firm's true intentions - to rid the staff of female trouble makers. But why? It all becomes clear as she learns of the egregious hostile and frequent harassment work environment the women are enduring. And given the firm's head partner is up for the attorney general nomination, nothing will hold him back from reaching his life long goal. Nothing. Not even Maggie Mahoney.Kate McGuiness' \"Terminal Ambition\" is a shocking tale. After reading this I sincerely hope that no women would ever have to work in an environment as destructive as this. The arrogance, selfishness, and indifference displayed by many of the male characters is appalling. McGuiness' writing is crisp and the plot believable even in such extreme circumstances though it was hard for me to fathom there could be so much of this behavior going on by so many in one place. If you have a low opinion of lawyers before you start reading this, it won't get any better I assure you.Overall, this was a very engaging though troubling read and achieves its goal of sensitizing readers to this very troubling issue from its subtlest to most severe forms. This is one in a series of Maggie Mahoney novels. I look forward to McGuiness' next work.Note: A complimentary copy of this work was provided in return for a review."}, {"userName": "Star", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/304219-star", "userReview": "Maggie Mahoney is a partner at the prestigious law firm of Sweeny, Owens & Boyle. Some of the people there feel she was only made partner because of her senior level husband, but she is a great attorney in her own right. When her husband and her best client perish in a tragic skiing accident, Maggie\u2019s left to fend for herself. \u2018Terminal Ambition\u2019 isn\u2019t your regular legal thriller as it is entirely based within the confines of Sweeny, Owens & Boyle and deals exclusively with the sexual harassment of female employees. Maggie hasn\u2019t realized how stressful and damaging an environment Sweeny, Owens & Boyle is for female employees as she hadn\u2019t been a victim of sexual harassment during her tenure there. However, once her eyes have been fully opened to the rampant the harassment and abuse is for the female employees, there is no going back. She\u2019s got to make this right, but there are plenty of powerful men standing in her way. Can she overcome the odds and clean up Sweeny, Owens & Boyle for good?I enjoyed \u2018Terminal Ambition\u2019 very much and I was pleasantly surprised at this different style of law drama. Maggie is a strong character who once she uncovers the depth of the sexual harassment at her office is determined to end it once and for all. The author has also brought to light the fact sexual harassment can happen anywhere and at any time. I think it\u2019s an issue more people need to be cognizant of and Ms. McGuinness helps bring it to shocking life. All of the characters are well-developed and due to the author\u2019s experience as a lawyer in a major firm, she has nailed the internal politics. A smart, savvy, and timely novel, \u2018Terminal Ambition\u2019 will make you look closely at your own life and your actions."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1500153-sandy", "userReview": "AN IMPORTANT BOOK FOR SOCIETY, AND A GREAT READ. I highly recommend this book. It's a riveting read on all fronts. Terminal Ambition has an opening chapter you'll never forget. The writing is as high-quality as any you'll find. The author drops you into the lightning-speed, competitive atmosphere of the highest levels of a major law firm. It feels like you're there: The dialogue, descriptions of the clothing, homes, and offices--everything about book's characters and their lifestyles is spot on. Which you would expect, given that the author was a partner in a major law firm. She knows her stuff.This book would satisfy if it were only a legal thriller, but it's more than that. Its subject is sexual discrimination and harassment in a huge legal institution. This is a topic that maters to all of us, not just women. I have not experienced the criminal harassment that some of the women in this book do. I do know women who have; it's something that spreads across the industries of our nation. From what one of my friends told me, when she finally got the courage up to complain to the highest levels of her company, her bosses did--exactly nothing. I would say that their lack of action damaged their personal integrity. And the perpetrator faced no consequences at all. What did untrammeled freedom to abuse do for his character? The issues raised in this book are important for our society--and our souls.There's more. Author Kate McGuinness includes the first chapter of the sequel to Terminal Ambition. Wow! It looks like book #2 in the series will be as thrilling and suspenseful as book #1. I hope she writes fast!"}, {"userName": "LORI CASWELL", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770012-lori-caswell", "userReview": "Losing her husband in an avalanche that she survived has given Maggie Mahoney a new view on life in general and her life as a lawyer/partner at Sweeny, Owens & Boyle. She loses her biggest client so when asked to be on Gender Equity Committee she agrees knowing the committee is just a smokescreen by Andy Anderson to make him look good as he vies for the office of Attorney General but it makes her look good to the firm. Unfortunately Sweeny, Owens & Boyle really does have a problem with sexual harassment of women and the new and improved Maggie can't just turn a blind eye.To think this kind of discrimination and harassment is still prevalent in 2012 just makes me sick. In the political arena of 2012 Republicans are waging a \"war on women\" as well. Equal pay for equal work and safety in the workplace should be paramount. The battles have been fought and already won. McGuinness's story shines a light on situations sadly still happening in the workplace today and that even a firm chairman with eyes on public office could attain his dream job while sweeping actionable offenses under the rug.This is a powerful story with a powerful protagonist fighting corruption in the workplace. The author's knowledge of legal and woman's issues makes this book an extremely credible read. The story evolves at pace that keeps the reader very engaged and those pages turning. The characters are sharp and the dialogue is smart. As a book dealing with sexual harassment there are a few explicit scenes.This is an excellent debut. I look forward to Erotic Capital, the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Mary (BookHounds)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1378745-mary-bookhounds", "userReview": "MY THOUGHTSLOVED ITMaggie Mahoney is not your typical trophy wife since she has a law degree and is married to a the managing partner but when he drops dead, she finds herself on the outs in the firm. When a rival and known womanizer (cue Brittney Spears) is named as the new manager, Maggie knows that even in her grief she can't sit back and watch. She fights her way through the old boys network and works to expose Jack Slattery as he tries to get rid of the female leaders through harassment and discrimination. Parts of this story could be ripped right from recent headlines about men in power and from what I have heard from friends in corporate leadership positions, there is a lot of truth about the abuse that women still endure to this day.This isn't my usual type of book, but I was hooked by the first chapter. Each chapter was even more compelling, even though parts of it horrified me. Jack is just the type of evil villain that your mother probably warned you about. Maggie is someone that our daughters should emulate and strive towards. I am so glad that the explosion of young adult books are bringing subjects like this to the forefront and teaching girls not to stand by or down to abuse. I have to admit parts of this book were difficult to read and I hope that the objectification of women will soon be a thing of the past. After reading Bond Girl by Erin Duffy (review here) which is a thinly veiled memoir of life in the pretty much male dominated world of finance, you can believe that a story like this could happen in a law firm."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2362650-melissa", "userReview": "When I was offered the chance to read and review Kate McGuinness\u2019s legal thriller Terminal Ambition, I was really excited. I may have kissed corporate life goodbye several years ago to be a self-employed writer/actor/improviser, but I still appreciate a good story. (I\u2019m still waiting for someone to write one centered on the mortgage industry.)I was not disappointed. McGuinness\u2019s protagonist, Sweeney and Owens law partner Maggie Mahoney is as three dimensional as any of the women I know in real life, and I had no trouble connecting with her. As a feminist myself, I also had no trouble sharing her very real frustration at the double standard she had to deal with, as a woman in general and as a woman in an overwhelmingly male industry.But Maggie wasn\u2019t the only character whose story appealed to me. I was also very much intrigued by Ginger and Rosalinda, as well as by the mystery of what was really going on with managing partner Erling \u201cAndy\u201d Anderson.Aside from compelling characters, Terminal Ambition also had a story that was well balanced in terms of character development, plot development and pace. I\u2019ll confess that the prologue left me expecting more of a murder mystery than a true thriller, but once I was into the novel, it was a fast read that left me really satisfied.The last section of the book teases the next novel from McGuinness \u2013 another Maggie Mahoney story \u2013 I\u2019m already looking forward to reading that.Bottom line? Terminal Ambition is terminally awesome.Goes well with\u2026a vodka martini and a plate of sushi."}, {"userName": "Kari", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101554-kari", "userReview": "When I started Terminal Ambition, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. Don't get me wrong, I am all for women's rights, especially in the work place. However, I was afraid it would be too preachy. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I found that once I started it, I was eager to see where the story would lead. At first, Maggie is pretty ambivalent about the way women seem to be treated in her law firm. Even to the point that she just deflects advances from colleagues without taking action. When she is asked to be part of a committee to look into harassment issues at her firm, her ideals begin to quickly change. I liked Maggie's character. Once she had her eyes opened, she realizes that she cannot just sit back and do nothing.Terminal Ambition is a very compelling and well written book. I wouldn't say it was a thriller as there really weren't any surprises. For me it was more a peek into the \"Old Boys Network\" that is still (disgustingly, IMHO) prominent in many professions today.One of the things that I liked about the book is that it isn't all written from Maggie's perspective. The book alternates between different characters so that the reader gets to see several sides. There is also a slight hint at a possible romance with a colleague/friend. Hopefully, we will see more of Sam in coming books. I look forward to see more from this author in the future!"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2065514-michael", "userReview": "Maggie Mahoney is a partner in a major Wall Street law firm.When her husband dies in a skiing accident and she returns to work, she is asked by a senior partner to look into the Gender Equity Committee and the treatment of women in the firm.
