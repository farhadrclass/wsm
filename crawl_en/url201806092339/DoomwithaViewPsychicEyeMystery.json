When the heroine has the emotional stability of a two year old and can only find solace in her boyfriend's manly arms, I shrug and keep turning pages. When her best friend is engaging in reckless behaviors typically seen in psychopaths, I barely pause. When a painfully stereotypical love/hate relationship between two main characters is given way too many pages to unfold, I roll my eyes but keep going. It's light reading, after all, and I was perfectly happy with this book despite these issues, at least until the heroine walked into a drag bar. This book spent an incredible amount of time insensitively portraying gender nonconforming behavior, primarily concerning the art of drag performance. Laurie portrays drag queens in an unappealing and pathologizing light, even allowing characters to describe it as a 'perversion'. I'm not claiming to be an expert on drag and the culture around it, but even a layperson can tell that Laurie uses outdated, pathologizing terminology to describe drag queens. MAJOR SPOILER: she goes so far as to imply that being discovered as a drag queen is enough reason to resign from office or even commit murder! This portrayal of drag queens is completely unacceptable from a book published only 5 years ago, and ultimately brings what I would have called a 4 star light read down to a one star disappointment that I would rather throw in the trash than force on another reader."}, {"userName": "Paradoxical", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1964421-paradoxical", "userReview": "What is with these books and people being unexpectedly rich? It's like some sort of wishful thought the author has. I also sigh over how in your face Abby is about her psychic ability--every skeptic she meets (who continues to not believe) is automatically some sort of jerk, and while I wouldn't ordinarily care, I would greatly prefer it if the author was at least a bit subtle about it. As it is, it's like some sort of vendetta against all of the nonbelievers in the world. And, you know, for someone you'd think would be a little more sympathetic, Abby is rather judgmental herself. \"Nervous little nerd\" comes to mind. As for the plot of the book--eh. It was all right. The ending was rather predictable (at least to me, anyway). The little thing with Candice and Harrison at the end was completely obvious and made me roll my eyes. A lot. It just felt very unnecessary and off putting. In the end, the mystery holds my most attention and everything else is sort of bland or annoys me.

I am not a fan on scifi, ghosts, vampires or werewolves. I do however like some of the psychics. And when it doesn't become too heavy and you can enjoy a laugh occasionally, I'm in. Victoria Laurie, the author, is an actual police psychic and still does readings so it's enjoyable to read about how she explains the ability her character has and how she uses it. You can pretty much guess the ability she gives her character is actually her own. Ms. Laurie can't write these books fast enough! I had the first seven of her books and was just reading one after the other when I realized she was going to have another coming out this year. I stopped reading the series and put a advance order on the newest one so I could get it as soon as it was published. When I received the 9th one I picked up where I left off on this series. Now, I've discovered a new Psychic Eye Mystery, Lethal Outlook, is due to come out in 2012, and it's still to early to preorder it!

I\u2019m rapidly catching up with the current books in the series and am going to be so disappointed when I do. I really don\u2019t want this to end. Abby and her PI friend/partner are called in to help the FBI in trying to solve the disappearance of three college students, all from different states, but all the son/daughters of state Congressmen(women). I have been intrigued by physic ability for a long time and sometimes wish I had some ability, but at other times, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t, as I\u2019m not sure I could deal with it. Abby can be very irritating at times \u2013 she jumps to conclusions, can be very judgmental (even though she hates it when people \u201cjudge\u201d her ability), but on the whole is a likeable and empathetic character. I just love that her relationship with Dutch, an FBI agent (who does not have a big part in this book, but is involved), continues to grow. I really like these two characters together. I really hope they continue to grow and stay together.Candice, the PI friend, is a bit of a woman PI clich\u00e9, but not over the top and I like her. The friendship, partnership and trust between Abby and Candice is really apparent and seems to be more the focus in this book. While they are a bit out of control at times (breaking and entering; ignoring orders and procedures), they do seem to move the investigation along and get things done. It appears the FBI may be into using Abby\u2019s abilities more as the series continues. I hope it continues to be enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Myhotstylist", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4231459-myhotstylist", "userReview": "This is the 7th installment of Miss Abby Cooper, PI. And I have to say it was one of the best out of the entire series. This book had a more serious tone about it, which I appreciated after all the crazy stunts pulled in Las Vegas. :) The gang buckles down and gets to work hard on this case, leaving no stone unturned. We are introduced to Dutch's new boss, Agent Harrison who is a real \"doody-head\" and doubts Abby's abilities. There was enough bickering in this book to bring just the right amount of comic relief to it. The ending had a nice twist (as per Mrs. Lauries standards) that I didnt see comming. In this story, Abby and her partner Candice team up with the FBI to find 3 missing teenagers. (mentioned previously in the last book) As always, Abby uses her skill and wit to outsmart and catch the killer.

It feels like Laurie levelled up on her editor here--people only \"moseyed\" and \"boogied\" out of scene ONCE in the entire book. Overall, the writing felt more polished, which made it easier for me to get engrossed in the story.Giving Abby a hardcore skeptic to battle with really upped the entertainment value of the quieter times.

And Dutch has some \"splaining to do\" in regards to his security company and moolah he is apparently rolling in!Present day...Robalard's replacement Special Agent Bryce Harrison is here, large and in-charge already, and Gaston calls on Abby to help locate three missing college students. Dutch has recovered from his ruptured appendix and is back to work as well. Upon agreeing to take the job with the FBI, Abby includes Candace in the deal since they are business partners, and she has more experience in dealing with law enforcement. The girls are flown off to Washington D.C. to get briefed on the case with the new man in charge: Harrison. Harrison does not make a good impression! Neither does Abby according to Candace. After much reluctance, Abby finally agrees to a total make over, and I love it!!Once Abby and Candace do finally meet Harrison, boy is he a jerk! I mean really! So after being told to sit there and shut up during interviews with the missing kids' parents, the girls go in with heavy hearts. When the mother opens the door the situation could have never been predicted! Well it could have but we'll just call it a glitch...anyhoo...the mother knows Candace and Abby already!!

Again, if this is your first time listening to her, she does not act out and \"perform\" the story, she narrates, simple as that.

Note: I advise books 1-6 be read before in order to obtain a solid history of multiple characters and their importance.Summary:After the situation in Vegas, no one is more stunned than Abby Cooper that the FBI would like her input on one of their cases. With the drastic turn in the economy and her appointment book frighteningly empty, Abby nervously accepts the offer of working a case of missing college students. Upon arrival at meeting of the task force, all of Abby's worries come true when she is faced with the Assistant Special Agent in Charge and Dutch's new boss, who is a very vocal skeptic. Almost immediately, Abby understands that she is at the center of a political struggle, and any wrong move could mean bad things for her reputation and Dutch's employment status. With her good friend and PI, Candice, at her side, Abby quickly dives into the search for three missing teenagers, but it doesn't stop her feelings of dread at what's to come. Dealing with skepticism and negativity threatens to topple Abby's already frazzled nerves, but her intuition prevails and she starts finding workable clues that move the investigation along. Abby is convinced that the abductions aren't random and each of the kids are linked, but solid evidence is in short supply. Plane crashes, 3 states, ghostly encounters, and haunted houses all lead Abby to kidnapper more unstable than even she could predict, and it will take the entirety of her new team to piece together the clues before time runs out.I never have a problem falling into Abby's adventures. She's always entertaining with her spunk and ability to get herself into the funniest and sometimes most dangerous of jams. Her psychic ability just adds to the intrigue and fascination. This current installment showed that Abby's world is fast changing. While I enjoyed this book, the idea of a change for Abby in future books has me a wee bit nervous, only because I already love her wild adventures. Still, I will definitely be reading on even if just to see what happens with her and Dutch, and to challenge myself with a bit of murder mystery. I was disappointed we didn't get as much of him in this book. We were introduced to a couple of new characters that will be important for future stories, but Dutch is where it's at for me. Lol. The mystery was a good one. I was sure I had the villain totally pegged, but was way off.

Abby, her boyfriend Dutch, and best friend Candice are old friends to readers at this point and it's always fun to visit them. Candice in particular is a great character and it's always fun to read about her and her adventures. The addition of Brice Harrison creates some great tension among the characters as he refuses to believe in Abby's psychic abilities despite the growing evidence. Laurie's plot line is very current as many of the characters worry about the state of the economy (a worry that plays a major part at the end of the book). The mystery of the missing college students is well written and plotted with plenty of twists and turns and ends with a surprise that no one (including Abby herself) would have expected. The psychic elements are well done and believable - despite what Harrison thinks! The end of the book is filled with some tense, very scary moments that will have readers on the edge of their seats and eagerly turning the pages to see what happens next. Several things happen throughout the book and at the end that promise to take the series in a new direction (both literally and figuratively).

So she agrees to work with the FBI after being asked by Dutch's boss' boss Gaston. Unfortunately, Dutch's new boss Harrison hates the idea of a psychic working on his task force to find missing students. He frequently tests her psychic skills to disprove everything that she says to get her off the job, which he succeeds in. Abby and Candace begin to investigate on their own but it puts them both in danger as they dig deeper than the bad guy wants them too.What I Liked and Didn't:I can understand why Abby would be annoyed at the frequent tests but I think that its understandable. As a person who doesn't believe in psychics, I'd test them because I wouldn't want a possible con artist to be involved in my case. It was just refreshing to have someone doubt Abby's skills considering that almost everyone immediately believes everything she says. As you can probably tell, I liked Harrison's character and totally wanted him to get with Candace.Plot-wise, it wasn't the worst of the series but it wasn't the best. It wasn't that it was badly written or that there weren't enough twists, it's just that I wasn't a plan of the story itself. There are moments where it just seems very soap opera but also areas where the plot didn't have enough mystery where it should have. It just seemed a bit mismatched and not as well thought out as the previous plots. I think that I would have just appreciated a different bad guy or even a different reason for the kidnappings.Final Thoughts:It was an enjoyable read and it certainly wasn't a hardship to finish it. It just didn't meet my expectations which may have been my fault anyway rather than the book's plot.Would I recommend it? If this was the first book of the series, I probably wouldn't but I'm more invested in what happens to the characters so I'd say go for it.Will I be carrying on the series?

Unfortunately, the ASAC, who was appointed after it was revealed that the last one had killed a women and has some pretty shady dealings, who also ended up dead after trying to kill both Abby and Dutch, isn't exactly a believer. In fact, he goes out of his way to make sure that Abby doesn't feel, in the slightest way, comfortable.

With Abby predicting early in the book that Dutch was going to move, I found myself wondering if they were going to either dissolve a relationship which they have been building for seven books and which I have just recently (and I mean very recently...try yesterday...) managed to get invested in, or if they were going to move them both. I'm not going to tell you what happens, of course, but I will say that I'm not entirely sure how much I like this new turn.

It's believed the kidnappings are linked because the teens were all children of senators.Given that this book didn't take place in Abby's hometown, some of the best characters were unfortunately absent this time.

She was a central character in Doom With a View and I love that she's getting more and more time in the spotlight.Abby's boyfriend Dutch works for the FBI (what a cool job!!). He recently got the position and now we get to meet some really awesome characters. Despite being a huge jerk for roughly 99% of the book, Agent Harrison grew on me. Can't wait to see him again! However, I will admit I was a little disappointed that the romance was so obvious (or maybe I'm just psychic :D!). Really, though, that was a bit of a let down and, to me, wound up feeling a bit forced and thrown together.I wasn't completely happy with some of the previous books, but Doomed With a View sucked me back in and I can't wait to start the next book.

No psychic abilities, period. Wow, if your Abby's friend, chances are your going to become a millionaire! Milo won the lottery, millionaire. Dutch has a security business, millionaire. Candice's grandma dies and low and behold, you guessed it, now Candice is a millionaire and didn't even know her Granny was so wealthy. Let's see.....oh, the handyman...well, he's not a millionaire but he's moving to Texas to work for an relative and it's going to bring him lots of work and money. I want to be Abby's friend! I live in Texas already and this is where they are all (yes, all her friends) are moving in the next book! Which even after all of my lil' fit throwin' above, I am going to read. Like I said, I do enjoy this series. Laurie is a fun writer and these books have that Agatha Christie/Nancy Drew but with psychic powers appeal. They make me smile, even thru a little eye rolling. A little bit predictable, but a fun read none the less. :)"}, {"userName": "annapi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1718859-annapi", "userReview": "Psychic Abby Cooper is surprised to be asked by the FBI to assist in the investigation into 3 missing teenagers, especially as her boyfriend's new boss Agent Harrison is hostile to her ilk. Apparently Harrison's commander is friends with one of the parents and is determined to use all resources available, so Abby and her PI friend Candace face a roomful of hostile or at least skeptical agents, led by one who is eager to expose her as a fraud and kick her off the case. However, they are determined to do their best for the victims, especially as Abby has discovered that 2 are already dead and the third has only days left.Victoria Laurie writes this one with her usual smoothness, marred on occasion by rocky dialogue. Her handling of the villain at the end, however, left a little to be desired - she seems to have had this urge to cram as much psychological baggage into the murderer as possible to make the ending revelation spectacular. It falls a little short, as while the identity of the killer was plausible (one of 2 of my guesses), the motives were a bit of a stretch for me, especially for the accomplice. And the romantic sidebar could be seen coming from a mile away. Nevertheless, this moved along at a quick pace, and makes a good addition to a series that is progressing nicely. It may lack meat, but makes a good addicting snack."}], "description": "Doom with a View (Psychic Eye Mysteries, Book 7)", "title": "Doom with a View\n      \n          (Psychic Eye Mystery #7)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6356180-doom-with-a-view", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388276601l/6356180.jpg", "reviews": 202, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/74488.Victoria_Laurie", "name": "Victoria Laurie"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fantasy", "Mystery", "Mystery", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6356180-doom-with-a-view", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27312020-kobni-pogled", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8176410-doom-with-a-view", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/574955.Abby_Cooper_Psychic_Eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20338342-when", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129537.What_s_a_Ghoul_to_Do_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/574963.Better_Read_Than_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129534.A_Vision_of_Murder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
