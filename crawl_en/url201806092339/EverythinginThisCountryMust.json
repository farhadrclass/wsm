The title story only lasts 23 minutes. I am listening to the audiobook performance. Yes, it feels like a performance, not the reading of a story! The narration by Clodagh Bowyer, in her young feminine Irish patois, was fantastic. The book\u2019s narrator is a fifteen year old. Her perception of the event is that of a young Catholic Irish girl. She saw the body of the male swimmer. That is what she would see. She saw the agony and frustration of her father. She saw both, and there she stands wondering how one reconciles the two! Politics and religion and culture all mirrored in one short episode. I end up frustrated because I want more! I have been given a beautiful snapshot!The second story lasts only 26 minutes, narrated by Paul Nugent. This story shows the other side, a Presbyterian family living in Northern Ireland. The point of contention is here within the family. Secrets. Still, very, very Irish! I am less sure what McCann is trying to tell us, but the small details create a picture that you feel rather than see. The short remarks, which can scarcely be called dialog, capture the mood perfectly. Another snap-shot, but less satisfying because I don\u2019t know what is being said.Awfully glad that the next track is two hours and forty minutes long. Something to bite into and hold a while\u2026. This one is narrated by Sean Gormley. Beautiful. That is the best adjective to describe this. McCann knows how to capture a person, that person\u2019s cultural identity, age, family, circumstances and what makes that person who he is. He knows how to capture the wonderful in the sorrowful. He knows how to make you draw parallels between the book\u2019s characters and your own loved ones. The main character is a Catholic, 13 years old and Irish. The setting is, I would guess, in the early 1980s. The themes are sexual awakening, family relationships, friendship and of course the religious/political strife that so characterizes Northern Ireland. You don\u2019t have to be interested in the political theme to love this book. Any mother who has had a 13 year old son will relate to this book. It is believable, it is sweet, and it is hard. This too is a snap shot, of a few weeks in a thirteen-year-old's life. Do you remember swimming with your young adolescent son, splashing water, the cold air, the quiet lake, the pull on your arms as you propel yourself forward?Took away one star only because the \u201cglimpses\u201d are too short and the middle short story confused me.

The novella is an absolute stunner, a thing of beauty, and ranks as one if the very best pieces I have had the fortune to read. Think of McCann as Joyce mixed with Hemingway, although this is a stupid way of putting things. But if you liked Old Man and the Sea, you will love this. All three works have an adolescent protagonist. McCann really captures this age of flux perfectly, and in a serious tone. This is quite unlike what others, say David Mitchell, do with their adolescents. They make them fun. McCann, on the other hand, grounds his young ones in the same conflicts as the elders."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Okay, so, see, there's this place called Ireland?

And so these stories are, like, really really sad and the people are all poor and kinda mean and they don't seem like they ever smile or anything?

I decided to start with a book of smaller stories of his and than go from there. I loved them. I loved his writing, simple yet elegant he presents the reader with wonderful and uncluttered visuals. All these stories take place and are said to represent all side of Northern Ireland. The first short story shows us a young girl, not understanding her father's politics. The second story, which was my favorite although the first time I read it I thought it had ended rather abruptly so I went back and read it again. The dilemma of the young son, having to choose to help his mother and to keep something that big from his father was masterfully done in the short amount of pages McCann had to relate this all to the reader. The novella was amazing as well. Felt for that whole family and the young boy in particular.

In two short stories and one novella, we see how the unrest in Ireland in the 80's and 90's was like any other horrific war; it sunk into the core of its people, where it stayed and turned to concrete. McCann is unflinching when it comes to his descriptions of how it fundamentally changed people, and the undeniable outcomes that are stark, stripped and tragic. Quick read, but not quickly absorbed. This one will take a while."}, {"userName": "Camille Maio", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3934710-camille-maio", "userReview": "I was interested in reading this book because of my family's cursory connection to \"The Troubles\". I have never read anything about them, though, so I expected to be swept up into a story that grabbed my emotions and made me feel what it was really like to be there. This didn't happen. There were interesting bits - I liked the creative touch of the boy and his mother making chess pieces out of bread and about the countdown of his uncle's weight as he sat in prison. I might have been more drawn in if it was the father/husband in jail, but an uncle whom the boy barely knew felt like a thin thread that distanced the reader from being compelled."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2320578-erin", "userReview": "This is my first Colum McCann book. After reading this one, I will definitely read more. His writing, while spare, considered and focused, was almost lyrical in its use of language, and drove me to re-read many sentences I found particularly lovely. As an example, I quote this from the first story in the book (**potential spoiler**):\"The ticking was gone from my mind and all was quiet everywhere in the world and I held the curtain like I held the sound of the bullets going into the draft horse, his favourite, in the barn, one two three, and I stood at the window in Stevie\u2019s jacket and looked and waited and still the rain kept coming down outside one two three and I was thinking oh what a small sky for so much rain.\"Wonderful.Both stories and the novella are told from the point of view of children, and all concern the Troubles in Northern Ireland. I think it's particularly difficult to write about Northern Irish politics, and most who do fall into the inevitable pitfalls of sentimentality, outrage, or too closely aligning with one political viewpoint. McCann avoids most of these problems by viewing events through the eyes of those too young to be yet jaded or hysterical. This is particularly true in the stories, which I found more successful than the novella. The novella, Hunger Strike, was the most thought-provoking but the least polished of the stories in this book, for me. It concerns a Derry teenager whose mother has removed him to Galway while his uncle is on hunger strike in prison. I appreciated that McCann didn't feel compelled to give us a history lesson here, and anyone who doesn't know their history can get themselves to Google and figure out who Bobby Sands was on their own. The fury and injustice of this time in history are encapsulated in young Kevin, whose coming of age is marked by his rage and helplessness. He is so angry, and so powerless to do anything. He is relegated to wearing a black armband far from his home and the ongoing riots. While his uncle starves to death and his hometown burns, Kevin plays video games in a Galway arcade and takes up kayaking with an elderly Lithuanian couple. I think, in the end, I wanted more clarification on what Kevin's final act signifies, although perhaps the random violence is an answer in itself."}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3624753-zo-danielle", "userReview": "Everything in This Country Must is a small collection by Colum McCann which includes two short stories and one novella. The book begins with the title story \"Everything in This Country Must\" which is the story of a father and daughter whose lives have been ruined by the death of the mother and daughter at the hands of soldiers. However when their best draft horse is about to drown it is soldiers which come to help them pull it out of the water, something the father is unable to make peace with. For him, he would rather the horse drown then accept their help. \"Everything in This Country Must\" was actually my favourite of the three stories in this collection- although at times vague and mysterious it remained touching and powerful. Even without knowing the details, you could understand the conflict of emotion the father and daughter felt.In \"Wood\" a small boy helps his mother prepare wooden poles to sell for the Protestant marches in secret from his disabled father who can no longer earn a living for the family. It is definitely a short story, but McCann is able to capture the secrecy and conflict the young boy feels as well as the mystery of the night-time.\"Hunger Strike\" was the novella, and at a hundred pages it was about five times as long as either short story. I would have hoped that this length would allow McCann to flesh out the characters, as opposed to the short story format. Unfortunately \"Hunger Strike\" was my least favourite of the three stories- although the background stories of the main characters were less mysterious than \"Everything in This Country Must\" and \"Wood\" I actually felt less emotion and compassion towards the main character, a young boy who has lost his father and whose uncle, an IRA member, is on a hunger strike as he attempts to gain political prisoner status. The novella had moments of brilliance but overall it lacked the precise, clarity and emotional strength of the other stories.All three stories give a snapshot into Northern Ireland, a landscape McCann is definitely familiar with and in that way it felt less forced for me than This Side of Brightness. So although the two short stories are four star quality, \"Hunger Strike\" lost a star for how I felt about Everything in This Country Must so I can only give it three. ***"}, {"userName": "Joanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279142-joanie", "userReview": "After thinking about it for a few days I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars. This is a collection of two short stories and a novella, all set in Northern Ireland during \"The Troubles\" of the late 70's, early 80's and all told from a child's point of view. McCann not only explores the politcal struggles of that time, but the struggles kids face when they feel pulled in two different directions. In the first story \"Everything in this Country Must\" a young girl struggles with her feelings of gratitude towards a group of British soldiers and her loyalty to her father after the soldiers free their horse from a river.In \"Wood\" a young boy helps his mother with a job comissioned by the British while keeping it a secret from his father.  The novella \"Hunger Strike\" is about a boy whose uncle has recently joined the hunger strike in the H Block of Long Kesh prison, after Bobby Sands and a few others have already died. The boy's mother has moved them from Northern Ireland to Galway so they can escape the mayhem but he longs to be back there, to be in the thick of things.McCann's writing is sparse, almost terse, but he packs so much into every sentence. Although the subject matter here is sad, McCann manages not to make it depressing, which is quite an accomplishment. A lot of times when the writing is stark, the descriptions bleak, the book becomes heavy and depressing, but not here. I have always loved authors who write they lyrical descriptions, they make me want to savor every word (think Pat Conroy, Amy Tan.) McCann is almost the opposite, he's not flowery, he doesn't go on for pages and pages about the Irish countryside, making you feel as if you're there. McCann writes these short little sentences that squeeze your heart. In the first story (I returned my copy to the library so I'm paraphrasing) he writes \"the sky seemed too small for so much rain.\"I have to read more by McCann."}, {"userName": "Mom", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6503374-mom", "userReview": "A quiet and powerful trio of stories set in Northern Ireland during the years of political turmoil.

Hunger Strike, in particular, is probably one of the best pieces of writing I've read in a while in terms of its vividness and restrained but palpable emotion.

They all feature \"The Troubles\". The short stories feature a first-person youth. Katie in the title piece is 15. She says things like \"I stretched wide like love\", and \"The night had started stars. They were up through the branches. The river was spraying in them\". The son in \"Wood\" doesn't yet shave. He begins by saying \"It was just past night-time when we brought the logs down to the mill. The storm was finished but there was snow still on the hedges and it looked like they had a white eyebrow\" and later (p.22) says \"There was ivy on the walls and it looked like our secret was climbing up the vines to Daddy's room\".They are convenient observers who don't understand (or at least can't express) what's happening, especially in the larger world. This is plausible trait in children. Katie seems naive for her age (taking an instant fancy to a soldier although her father hates them) but maybe she's led an isolated life and has been deprived of love. The children have to play the roles of adults, though they still play like kids sometimes. The author ventriloquizes (rather than intrudes) when the children can't express enough. This mix lets the work be \"lyrical\" (the author putting words into the children's mouths) and also \"controlled\" (the children seem unmoved by what they see). We see the committed, emotional parents via the children's clinical observations. It can be highly effective, but you have to buy into the style and its contradictions.I'd already read the title story in \"The Art of the Story: An International Anthology of Contemporary Short Stories\". I was impressed. McCann was under 35 when he wrote it. The child feels powerless against fatalism - \"Stevie and the draft horse were going to die, since everything in this county must\". Perhaps the father knew that the horse was too injured to survive anyway.In \"Woods\" the mother colludes in a small way while her husband's bedridden after a stroke. She enlists her oldest son, telling him not to tell the rest of the family.Kevin in \"Hunger Strike\" is 13. His mother's trying hard to keep him away from the troubles (they've moved south to live in a caravan, and she's careful with her accent) but Kevin's floundering in search of a male role model. Unlike the youths in the other stories, Kevin is rebellious, has few responsibilities foisted upon him, and is interested in distant events - as long as they involve relatives. He does his own hunger strike secretly, in sympathy with that of his uncle. As in the other stories, there are distracting sentences* the flat start of \"They went towards the sea and the man looked like he was walking towards days that once had been\" contrasts sharply with the rest of the sentence* \"the mountains contorted the blacktop roads to their liking\" comes amongst thoughts explicited owned by Kevin, but whose observation is this really?The ending is obvious in a short-story way, though effective. At least he didn't burn his boats."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Smith", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26298171-jonathan-smith", "userReview": "Typical Colum...AwesomeGreat prose and characters.

I did enjoy Hunger Strike, the novella, but the second story of the collection, Wood, failed to match the emotion Hunger Strike and the eponymous story.Wood is the story of a young boy living with his mother, who takes care of the blind father, and his two brothers. The father, a woodworker before his accident, is laid up in bed. Two men come to the door and ask the mother if they can have some work done. Previous visitors to the house have asked for the same, but they are turned away. The mother and son end up filling the order made by the visitors, and they have to hide the work from the devout presbyterian father. Honestly, it brought down the entire book for me. It fell flat. The title story, a first person account of a girl, our narrator, and her father attempting to save their drowning horse, is filled with much more life, but I still couldn't get fully on board. An army truck and several soldiers arrive on the scene of the father's horse drowning, and he is infuriated by their choosing to destroy his hedge to more easily help them. The father appears to not want the soldier's assistance and would rather his horse drown in the flooded river. The soldiers help save the drowning horse, and the father does not want to accept their help with grace, but the daughter struggles to please her father and wants to show the soldiers, one in particular, her gratitude. It is revealed that the mother and brother were killed in an accident involving soldiers and an army vehicle. The story ends with the girl's father killing the horse in a heartbreaking scene, the quiet calm broken by the sound of his gunshots.Hunger Strike, the novella, was by far the best piece in this collection. It is the story of a boy living with his recently widowed mother trying to simulate his uncle's experience as a prisoner on hunger strike. He feels a deep connection to his father's brother without having met him and consistently questions his mother regarding his uncle's condition. The boy finds peace, that he ultimately destroys in anger, kayaking with a Lithuanian man that lives close to the beach. This story is raw and filled with beauty and the extreme rage of oppressed teenage angst. It is worth picking up this book for Hunger Strike alone, but you can skip the other two stories if you feel like they wouldn't interest you, but I'd suggest giving the title story a chance."}, {"userName": "Arti", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4477476-arti", "userReview": "A book compiling two short stories and a novella, Everything in this Country Must reaffirms my admiration for Colum McCann's spare and powerful writing.McCann is the author of the 2009 National Book Award winner Let The Great World Spin. In my review of that book, I noted how he'd intricately woven together seemingly unrelated stories against the backdrop of the Twin Towers, crafting a moving tribute to NYC.Before NYC, McCann had written about his home country Ireland. Everything In This Country Must (2000) is a poignant portrayal of how the political turmoils in Northern Ireland during the 80's affect the three young protagonists in each of these stories. All the short pieces in the book are masterfully rendered, immediate, sharply focused, intense, minimal yet deeply charged. Above all, I've appreciated, as with Great World, McCann's insightful metaphors.***Everything In This Country Must: Short StoryNightfall, cold and raining. A man's favorite work horse is near drowning with its forelegs caught in some rocks at the bottom of a flooding river. He gets his 15 year-old daughter to help him hold the horse's head above water with a rope while he frantically dives into the water to get its legs out, but to no avail. He desperately needs help.Soon enough, an army truck passes by. A few British soldiers quickly jump out to help. O what plight! The wrong people coming to the man's aid. These soldiers remind him of the loss of his beloved. Despite his protest, they save the horse. The daughter now is torn between her gratitude towards the soldiers and her father's anger.Of course I will not tell you everything about this story. You must experience it yourself.

It is such a complicated issue that I feel the more we read, the more we can try to understand the events and how they affected individuals. Each of the stories in this book concern young people grappling with violent events which directly affect their families.

It's a sad but lyrical story, like a literary keening.I recommend any Colum McCann book, but you'll need to be in the mood for this one."}, {"userName": "Emily White", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28476378-emily-white", "userReview": "Calum McCann visits many of the issues involved in the Northern Ireland conflict of a few years ago. One story tells of a protestant family that secretly makes wooden flagpoles for their Catholic enemies so that they have enough money to live on. Another tells of a young man displaced with his mother from their home so that they can stay safe. So much is explored in this tome, much of it heartbreaking, but much of it about learning from our experiences as well. I heard Colum McCann speak once around the time his novel This Side of Brightness was coming out and I fell in love with his stories. He is a newer Irish voice of reason."}, {"userName": "Jack Long", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4906384-jack-long", "userReview": "Colum McCann's Everything in this Country Must consists of a novella and two short stories with the backdrop of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. In the title story, a teenage girl must choose between allegiance to her Catholic father and gratitude to the British soldiers who have saved the family's horse. The protagonist of Hunger Strike, a novella, tries to replicate the experience of his uncle, an IRA prisoner on hunger strike. In Wood, a small boy does his part for the Protestant marches concealing his involvement from his ill father.Equal parts death and beauty, soulful prose, Everything in this Country Must was an excellent read, one that I'll visit again."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1610566-anna", "userReview": "Had it on my shelf because I loved \"Zoli\" from McCann....a collection of two short stories and a novella, it is formatted in a manner suitable for 'easy reading'-- and that's exactly what it was. Perhaps it is the kind of book that needs to be read slowly, or more than once, to be fully appreciated. I didn't get much out of the stories other than in-the-moment entertainment, but as a quick read, I was compelled to finish the book in two sittings. The writing is bare. Enough to tell a story, but not a story that one becomes a part of, not a story which is inspiring of outside thought."}], "description": "In his fourth book, Colum McCann turns to the \"troubles\" in Northern Ireland and reveals the reverberations of political tragedy in the most intimate lives of men and women, parents and children. In the title story, a teenage girl must choose between allegiance to her Catholic father and gratitude to the British soldiers who have saved the family's horse. The young hero of  Hunger Strike, a novella, tries to replicate the experience of his uncle, an IRA prisoner on hunger strike.
