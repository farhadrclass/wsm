The strips are still funny, the beauty of it is that these gags were just as funny 40 years of repeats later, but they're also the reason the strip got a stale reputation in the first place. But I can't hold that against Schulz, he couldn't possibly have guessed how popular his strip was going to become (in 1955 the circulation was still small) and ever be collected even. If you're writing a new strip every day you're going to reuse a joke or three.Snoopy still gets around for the most part on four paws, but he really begins to take off as something more than canine in this volume. His impressions of animals, famous personages, and neighborhood children take off, much to consternation of Charlie Brown. By this time Snoopy is definitely Charlie Brown's dog, too, whereas before he had been a true \"neighborhood dog\" or possibly even Shermy's.The timelessness of Peanuts is a part of its charm but every once and awhile Schulz couldn't resist commenting on the emerging pop culture of the kid's, whether it was devotion for Miss Frances from a tv show called \"Ding Dong School\" or Davey Crocket. Schulz is best when he walks that line between \"adult\" awareness and conventions, and the simple dimensions of childhood thinking. \nThis is the last volume I have on hand, and only because I bought it for my dad a few Christmases ago, his birth year, but I will be keeping an eye out for later volumes. There is some repetition, but plenty of genuine insight. Still, it's probably best I'm taking a break from them for awhile. GoComics has every Peanuts strip, including reprints, up on their site but several aren't available by their original publication dates so some gems, like Charlie Brown's first tree'd kite, Linus' exposure to literary criticism from Lucy, and a great moral relativism lesson from Lucy and Linus, among others, can't appear today. But that left room for this:More than enough reason to continue on.Finally, I got a suprise treat in this volume. One of our \"inherited\" toys from older cousins was a Viewmaster and dozens of slide sets. You remember Viewmasters don't you? The paper disks you slid into the plastic goggles, the 3D images that changed with a satisfying click-shunk of a lever. One set we had was of Peanuts and this exact Sunday strip was one of them!"}, {"userName": "Canavan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2140589-canavan", "userReview": "\u272d\u272d\u272d\u00bd"}, {"userName": "Spencer Borup", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17899434-spencer-borup", "userReview": "The cast: Charlie Brown, Lucy van Pelt, Linus van Pelt, Snoopy, Schroeder, Violet, Patty, Shermy, and Pig-Pen. Charlotte Braun only lasts a few strips into this volume, and then she disappears forever. I find it interesting that the cover of this volume is dedicated to Pig-Pen, because he wasn't actually in it that much. I guess there's only so many times Schulz could make a joke about a kid who hates baths.By now, 5 years into the birth of the most beloved comic of all time, PEANUTS, the main cast of characters, for the most part, have found their identities. Charlie Brown is the depressed, paranoid blockhead that the world now loves. Lucy is the demanding, loud fussbudget that likes to make up \"little known facts.\" Linus, while still not a philosopher yet, has found his security blanket, and Schroeder his piano. Snoopy, on the other hand, needs a little more time. When PEANUTS first started, Charlie Brown was the character Schulz identified most with (Charlie=Charles); but somewhere along the line, around 10 years in, I think, Schulz found much more in common with the most famous dog in the world (I SAID IT, GOOFY!), Snoopy. And while I'm only half-way there with this volume, it's delightful to see Snoopy slowly grow in both personality and in how Schulz draws him. He's still more puppy than human right now, but Schulz has finally settled on using thought bubbles for Snoopy, and he's started trying to be anything but a dog: a rhino, alligator, snake, etc.One last thing: The introduction to this volume was written by Matt Groening, the creator of the Simpsons. I never knew how much PEANUTS inspired him as an artist, but it was such a brilliant intro.Can't wait to finish up the '50s!"}, {"userName": "verbava", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2219641-verbava", "userReview": "\u0441\u043d\u0443\u043f\u0456 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0454 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0439\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0443 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0443 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0456\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0456\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457;\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0443\u0441 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0454, \u0449\u043e \u0449\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044f \u2013 \u0443 \u0444\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0456, \u0456 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044e\u0454 \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0456;\u043b\u044e\u0441\u0456 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0454 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0456\u0457 \u0432\u0438\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0456\u0436 \u0437\u0430 \u0448\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430;\u0448\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440, \u0443\u0442\u0456\u043c, \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0443\u0454 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0457\u0439 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0456 \u2013 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0456; \u0432\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0454 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0456\u0440\u043a\u0438, \u043d\u0430 \u044f\u043a\u0456 \u0446\u0456\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0443\u0454 \u0447\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0456 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0430;\u0430 \u0431\u0456\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0456 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0443\u043d \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0454\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0456\u0442\u0438, \u0447\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0456\u0445\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c. \u0456 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0449\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f, \u0437 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0456\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u043d\u043e."}, {"userName": "Dominick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5913578-dominick", "userReview": "Snoopy's Snoopy, we get the first football kick, the tree eats kites, etc. Schulz is finding the iconic elements of the strip, though there are still occasional odd elements (Snoopy actually talks once or twice, we hear an adult's voice once).

Many good examples of Lucy's charming lectures are included in the song Little Known Facts from the musical You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown:LUCYDo you see that tree?it is a Fir tree.It's called a Fir tree because it gives us fur,For coats,It also gives us wool in the wintertime.LINUSI never knew that before, Lucy. That's very interesting.LUCYThis is an elm tree.It's very little.But it will grow up into a giant tree,An oak.You can tell how old it is by counting it's leaves.LINUSGosh, Lucy, that's fascinating.CHARLIE BROWNNow wait a minute, Lucy. I don't mean to interfere, but-LUCYAnd way up there,Those fluffy little white things,Those are clouds,They make the wind blow.And way down there,Those tiny little black things,Those are bugs,They make the grass grow.LINUSIs that so?LUCYThat's right. They run around all day long, tugging andtugging at each tiny seedling until it grows into a greattall blade of grass.LINUSBoy, that's interesting.CHARLIE BROWNOh, good grief.LUCYAnd this thing here.It's called a hydrant.They grow all over,And no one seems to knowJust howA little thing like thatGives so much water.D'you see that bird?It's called an Eagle,But since it's little it has another name,A Sparrow,And on Christmas and ThanksgivingWe eat them.CHARLIE BROWNLucy, how can you say that?! I'm sorry, but I can't standidly by and listen to-LUCYAnd way up there,The little stars and planets,Make the rain,That falls in showers.And when it's cold and winter is upon us,The snow comes up,Just like the flowers.CHARLIE BROWNNow, Lucy, I know that's wrong. Snow doesn't come up,it comes down.LUCYAfter it comes up, the wind blows it around so itlooks like it's coming down but actually it comes upout of the ground- like grass. It comes up, Charlie Brown,snow comes up!CHARLIE BROWNOh, good grief!LINUSLucy, why is Charlie Brown banging his head againstthat tree?LUCYTo loosen the bark to make the tree grow faster.Clouds can make the wind blowBugs can make the grass growSo, there you goThese are little known factsThat nowYou know!Leading man Charlie Brown is as insecure as ever, and has plenty of football, baseball and kite-related faliures in this volume as well. Like always, he also struggles to make people like him, and once, talking to Violet, he realizes that maybe the reason people don't like him is because he's always whining about people not liking him.This volume is adorned by the ever filthy Pig-Pen however, whose dirtiness is limitless (we once spot an apparently unknown clean character though, who by the end of the strip is back to his old grimy self).This volume of the Complete Peanuts is as wonderful as ever, bringing many smiles and giggles and calming effects before sleep.This book also has an enthusiastic foreword by Matt Groening of The Simpsons."}, {"userName": "Vegantrav", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/834122-vegantrav", "userReview": "These early Peanuts strips are really interesting for the differences from the later strips:1. Some of the major characters (Violet, Patty--not Peppermint Patty but another character named Patty--and Shermy) in these strips have almost completely disappeared by the 1970s.2. Schultz draws Snoopy and Lucy slightly differently in these early strips--there is a real, noticeable difference.3. Snoopy actually seems to talk in many of these strips: Schutlz doesn't use the thought bubbles but the direct dialogue bubbles that all the human characters use.4. We actually hear (thought we don't see) the voices of an adult, Linus and Lucy's mother, in several strips.5. There are a whole range of characters that Schultz has not yet introduced: Charlie Brown's little sister Sally, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, Woodstock, and Rerun, to name a few.6. Lucy is not quite so hostile and mean, but she certainly shows the early signs of the little girl she will become. In many ways, she is rather naive and innocent in these early strips.7. One of my favorite strips in this collection (September 12, 1956) shows Charlie Brown actually successfully kicking the football, but it is Schroeder who is holding the football and not Lucy.Also interesting about this edition of collected strips is that the introduction was written by Matt Groening, the creator of the Simpsons. Groening cites Schultz as a major influence and praises him effusively. I find it amazing and delightful at the wide range of people of all types who have been influenced by Peanuts, which is, for me, easily the best comic strip of all time."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6022684-scott", "userReview": "Nothing I could say is going to add to or detract from Peanuts status as one of the classic comic strips, but still I'll go on record as saying it deserves that status. It really is great!This is the third volume in the series that I've read, having already gone through the 1950-52 and 53-54 books, all three obtained from my local library (which I also work at). The first two looked pretty beat up but this one was in great shape - is that evidence as to how many people started to read the whole series from the beginning but bogged down after two volumes? If so they quit too soon, things really start getting good in the third volume.The material in the first two volumes was almost all totally new to me, and the earliest strips really had sort of a different feel from the later Peanuts strips I was familiar with - both the drawing style and the humor reminded me a bit of Jules Feiffer. They were definitely great, but with the third volume Snoopy, Lucy and Linus all become much larger players in the strip, adding a lot to the off kilter humor of the strip.One thing I'll say about Schulz, even in his earliest days he was unashamed about using the same basic jokes over and over - not that any of my friends will think I have the moral authority to point the finger about that, I've been known to recycle my material too."}, {"userName": "Rick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764994-rick", "userReview": "The master hits his stride and even though characters, plot lines, and draftsmanship are all still evolving, this volume has laugh out loud moments and flashes of insight and wisdom. Snoopy does imitations of Violet, Lucy, and others. He melts to Chopin. Dances to his own drummer. Yet he still enjoys puppy pleasures, like stealing Linus\u2019s blanket and mad-dashing through the croquet wickets. He also engages in wishful thinking fantasies of being a different animal (rhinos, snakes, etc.) Charlie Brown fights his losing battle with self-esteem, argues the merits of Davy Crockett over Beethoven with Schroeder, has his stomach turned as he listens to Lucy instructing Linus on matters of nature and the world at large, and encounters his first frustrations with kites and trees. Pigpen emerges in full dustcloud glory. Lucy is not just a champion fuss-budget, mentor, and interpreter of the bug-world, but the character who dominates the others (not including Schroeder). Linus remains precocious in many ways, out-doing Charlie Brown in skills large and small. He also asks the shielding rhetorical question, What difference will it make in 500 years?

At this point, there's no more \"beginning\"--it is a great strip.One quibble: Lucy's determination to get married, and her disappointment that her kindergarten doesn't offer classes in homemaking.

No new characters at all are introduced in this volume, but Linus starts talking, Snoopy starts dancing and Charlie Brown is Charlie Brown."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090434-duane", "userReview": "In this volume you get to see the characters start to evolve into the people we knew during the tv years of Peanuts. From Linus' deeper dependence on his blanket, to Snoopy's imagination, you see the great wisdom that Charles Schulz had in helping us understand our own world. A great classic for everyone to enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Husti", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/174535-husti", "userReview": "Por alguna extra\u00f1a raz\u00f3n, que probablemente tenga que ver con el merchandising derivado de Peanuts, cre\u00eda que las aventuras de Charlie Brown y compa\u00f1\u00eda eran otra cosa, m\u00e1s alegre, m\u00e1s naif, m\u00e1s optimista.Pero leo esto y me encuentro con angustia vital, cinismo, mala leche...No es que no me haya gustado sino que \u00a1Me ha roto los esquemas!"}, {"userName": "Erik", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31054068-erik", "userReview": "The jokes and characters really feel like Peanuts.

Over half of the strips in this volume have never been printed since their original appearance in newspapers a half-century ago! Even the most dedicated Peanuts collector/fan is sure to find many new treasures. The Complete Peanuts will run 25 volumes, collecting two years chronologically at a rate of two a year for twelve years. Each volume is designed by the award-winning cartoonist Seth (It's a Good Life If You Don't Weaken) and features impeccable production values; every single strip from Charles M. Schulz's 50-year American classic is reproduced better than ever before. This volume includes an introduction by Matt Groening (The Simpsons) as well as the popular Complete Peanuts index, a hit with librarians and collectors alike, and an epilogue by series editor Gary Groth. 2005 Eisner Award winner, Best Archival Collection/Project.", "title": "The Complete Peanuts, Vol. 3: 1955-1956\n      \n          (The Complete Peanuts #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54597.The_Complete_Peanuts_Vol_3", "average": 4.52, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468508057l/54597.jpg", "reviews": 59, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/209672.Charles_M_Schulz", "name": "Charles M.
