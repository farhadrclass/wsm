I began The Maze Runner excitedly, hoping for an equally enjoyable, dystopian adventure. I didn't find it.The plot was intriguing and kept me reading; in fact, it was probably the only reason why I kept reading. Some writers are able to seamlessly integrate characterization and good writing with a fast-moving plot; James Dashner is not one of them. The pacing is strange, and Dashner's use of cliches became very irritating.The main character, Thomas, was annoying. Rather than allowing his readers to feel what Thomas feels, Dashner chooses to tell. We are told many times how \"frustrated\" and \"confused\" Thomas is, but we can't identify with him. Some of the supporting characters, such as Minho and Newt, could be interesting, but they remain secondary to Thomas. In addition, I was frustrated with the character Teresa. Teresa is the only female main character; instead of making her an intriguing, powerful female, she is christened with flimsy adjectives such as \"very pretty\" and \"smart\", becoming yet another 1-dimensional character. I realize that this is a plot-driven story and not a character-driven one, but I would hope that the characters would at least be appealing to the reader.Criticism aside, I found the book enjoyable, and the plot kept me hooked. I felt that the epilogue was well-written and I might seek out the rest of the series when it is published. Ultimately, it's unfortunate that Dashner's poor writing takes away from a good story line; in the hands of a writing master, I believe that The Maze Runner could have been something extraordinary.2.5/5EDIT: More than a year later, I have not procured any other books in the series, nor do I intend to. Personally speaking, this is one series better left alone."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "This book would have been great IF:1) the characters had some personality2) the main character - Thomas - weren't such a Gary Stu and showed some character development and growth instead of conveniently \"remembering\" important information to advance the plot3) the book weren't filled with atrocious made-up slang - \"shuck-face,\" really, is this supposed to be cool?4) the villains - Grievers - were actually scary or dangerous5) the maze had some kind of mystery about it and not limited to moving walls and un-threatening prickly Grievers6) the plot weren't based on constant withholding of information by everyone and releasing it 200 pages later than it should have been7) the smartest of the smartest kids actually did something smart and uncovered some mysteries of the maze during the 2 years spent there8) the death of main characters evoked any feeling in readers9) the book weren't so slow-moving (thanks to constant withholding of info) and BORING!In the present form \"The Maze Runner\" deserves nothing more than an OK rating for moderately interesting premise.

Have you ever had an eight-year-old kid try to describe to you winning a level of a video game? Have you ever had a middle-aged man try to describe to you completing the games section of the New York Times? Did those experiences involve multiple conversations like this:\u201cWhat is the maze?\u201d\u201cStop asking so many questions!\u201dI have to say that this book was more boring than having someone tell you in painful detail about winning a video game or finishing a crossword puzzle. It is more boring if only for the constant, \"What are you talking about?\" \"No! I won't tell you!\" This book is astonishingly boring. I know that I am predisposed not to like it because there are no female characters (no, I do not count the leggy, blue-eyed girlfriend as a female character), but, really, I ask you: are there any male characters either? If you say, yes, then I challenge you to prove it. Are Mario and Luigi and Princess Toadstool characters in Mario Kart? What about the ducks in Duck Hunt? Are they characters? We have to draw the line somewhere. And I submit to you that there are no characters in this book. Or, at least, there are fewer characters in this book than there are in Duck Hunt.Also, a couple of things that bothered me throughout: 1. What famous scientist was Minho named after? Okay, I just googled that and apparently Dashner \u201cpurposely\u201d named a few characters after scientists who will supposedly exist in the future. Like the only Asian kid in the book. Because there are no Asian scientists today that he could name someone after. *facedesk* And like Zart. Zart and the Asian kid were not named after scientists. *double facedesk*2. Why can\u2019t the grievers climb over the wall? They obviously can climb. But not over the wall? Did I miss this? At first I thought the kids were in some kind of dome, but then it seemed like it was just a really tall wall. . . . That it was impossible to climb? WHYYY?????3. What purpose does the telepathy serve? None is the answer. It serves no purpose. 4. Why is this book so, so, so long and boring?So, maybe a third of the way through the book, I developed this false hope that this book would be some kind of pretty metaphor for children going through the grieving process and supporting each other in loss. I thought, \u201cOh, grievers! Maybe the challenges of the maze and the bonding of the boys in the glade will have some larger message.\u201d No. This book is not about that. It is about doing the NYT games section and then maybe vague talk of zombies later. Total bullshit.I have to think this book came out while LOST was still on and before its terrible conclusion, which forced millions of Americans to face the fact that when it looks like a story will have no purpose, it probably has no purpose. I have to think Dashner thought he could bank on the millions of us willing to suspend our skepticism and keep watching a show whose writers clearly had no plan. I am hoping that in the wake of that disaster, we will have grown up a little and be less willing to stand for bullshit like this. I googled it, and, yes, I was right. Cashing in on gullible LOST audience.

It's funny how just a few years can change everything - your reading tastes, your expectations, your standards... because when I read The Maze Runner in early 2011, I enjoyed it a lot. It seemed fast-paced, exciting and a little scary. Plus, I thought the slang was a nice touch. Three years and a million dystopian/sci-fi books later and everything about me has outgrown this book. It's not terrible. I can still see why someone who is new to YA dystopias might get caught up in the loosely-plotted (read: nothing happens) drama and think that \"shuck\" amounts to a clever invention of a new language. But as I was rereading this before seeing the new movie, I realised just how much it pales in comparison to many others in the genre.The thing about this book is that it is so simplistic and... immature, I guess. I'm not here to simply piss off the book's fans - I enjoyed it too, remember! - and I can still see why it might provide some light entertainment. But... the characters and plot are so underdeveloped. The language seems silly now. The scary Grievers no longer seem scary, but cartoon comical instead. Dashner uses that tiresome old writing technique called \"withholding information\" to propel the non-existent plot along. The whole book is built around a single mystery - that of the maze - and our supposedly intelligent-beyond-belief characters keep the novel going by standing around and scratching their heads. It's so lacking in any depth, layers or complexity. Comparisons to The Hunger Games are frankly quite hilarious when you consider Collins' intricate world, complex characters and clever plot... then consider what Dashner offers up next to it. Not to mention that Thomas is an extremely boring, self-sacrificing MC.In its defense, though, I was still affected by what happens near the end. I would recommend the book - with some hesitation - for younger readers or those who are new to YA dystopian fiction.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Etnik", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34369915-etnik", "userReview": "Okay so before I start I want to say something.I personally hesitated to read this book because I heard too many bad reviews and things about this book.But let me tell you something.Yeah it has it's problems like the written style but this book has one of the best story plots I have ever read about.And believe,once you get into the book,you will not care about the writing or anything else.I am seriously so angry I haven't read this book early and even more for listening or reading those really bad reviews for this book.I know everyone has their own taste but really I heard things that really discouraged me to read this and they are not true.And one last thing before I continue with my review,this book is awesome without having instalove,or love at all,without having nakedness or anything like that.So if you find this interesting,pick it up and decide for yourself,because for me is totally worth it!\n____________________________________________\n\n\u201cIf you ain\u2019t scared\u2026 you ain\u2019t human.\u201d \n\n____________________________________________\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u26064.8 RUNNY STARS!\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\nYou can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!I admire this book,really from the first page to the last.I have been waiting for a dystopian like this.The Maze Runner is a full action pack novel with awesome badass moments and thrilling and suspense scenes.____________________________________________\n\n\u201cI've been shucked and gone to heaven.\u201d \n\n____________________________________________The world,the maze is one of the greatest ideas,and it was awesome.The way it was build,with sections and everything,the glade,the grivers,they were all so thoughtful and really well made.I also watched the movie and I must say it is a lot similar to the book,and it has visualized my thoughts.____________________________________________\n\n\u201cYou are the shuckiest shuck faced shuck in the world!\u201d \n\n____________________________________________The characters were also great.What I liked was the conversations they had with each other.They felt normal and real,exactly according to their age.Thomas is a great main character,but I don't know he has a thing for crying,and somehow he seemed weak sometimes.Newt was my favorite character.I also liked Teresa and Minho.____________________________________________\n\n\u201cShouldn't someone give a pep talk or something?\" Minho asked, pulling Thomas's attention away from Alby.\"Go ahead,\" Newt replied.Minho nodded and faced the crowd. \"Be careful,\" he said dryly. \"Don't die.\u201d \n\n____________________________________________The reason why this is not a 5star book for me,is because of the writing style.Like a lot of people,I had a problem,a minor problem with it.It was annoying,especially at the beginning.Also annoying were the repeated phrases like the names,and the sentences were somehow short and not very rich.But beside that everything was perfect for me!____________________________________________\n\n\u201cIt's kind of hard to ask a dead guy what he did wrong.\u201d \n\n____________________________________________The story follows a boy named Thomas who finds in a unknown place,with unknown boys.He doesn't remember anything beside his name.Others don't neither.He learns that he's placed in a maze,and there is no way out,at least not found yet.After his arrival,strange things start to happen,things that has never happened before,things that could bring only destruction and death.There must be a way out,and he has to find it!____________________________________________\n\n\u201cJust follow me and run like your life depends on it.

Sometimes this strategy backfires and the 'fluffy' book actually tries to break my long-suffering brain cells with its sheer stupidity.It's not even mediocre; mediocrity would be elevating this book to the undeserved heights. It's simply boring, uninspired, ridiculous and poorly executed. ------Let me sum up the things that I thought were awful, stupid or just plain ridiculous (apparently my febrile brain likes making lists):# The dumbed-down plot full of holes that relies on pointless withholding of any useful information. Seriously. When there is no reason for keeping the characters in the dark, all suspense goes out of the window. There was no reason why nobody could tell Thomas what was going on when he showed up in the Glade or when he saw the Doors or the Maze.While I'm at it, can anyone please explain why the klunky shanking shuckface are the words randomly capitalized? Is the book meant to evoke the thoughts of the German language where the nouns are capitalized? Or was the author too lazy to come up with proper names for places and instead just threw in some capitalization? Foolishness, I say.The frustrating to me approach of never discussing what happened with those who went through the Changing. The lack of curiosity about the only potential exit from the Maze that the boys have found in two (!) years. The pointless doing the same thing over and over again just to come up with the same results, relishing in the special status of the Runners instead of just sitting down to discuss the situation and their findings.# The atrocious unbearable awkward slang. Replacing 'fuck' with 'shuck' and 'shit' with 'klank' for PG purposes does not work when you shove it unto the readers' faces every sentence or so. At least be inventive or make it sound organic, but all that's achieved is sounding like a five-year-old complaining to her Mummy.\n\"You're the shuckiest shuck-faced shuck there ever was.\"\nI rest my case in the face of this nonsense.# The silver plate on which everything is handed to the absolutely special protagonist. Because Thomas is so special at fragging everything. He doesn't even need to try. Instead, when we need a proof of his awesomeness, the get the sudden impulses and urges that are never wrong, or if that fails, simply a quasi-recollection that saves the day. Which segues into my next frustration point:# The lack of any character development besides the-author-wants-it-so approach. The author knows what he wants to happen in this book, and he moves the characters along like checkers pieces, just to make plot happen. The characters are just sorta there, are static, and therefore I could never get invested in them enough to care even when some of them died. Especially when the death of at least one of them was pointless.# The pointless villains and scares that should have been comic relief instead. Yes, the Grievers and the strangely non-menacing way they were portrayed. The Maze that is anything but intimidating (that effect is due to the non-spectacular writing, really). The Changing - oh so scary of experience! - that does not really affect Thomas the Special Snowflake, not even a minor inconvenience.# The pointless vilifying of perfectly reasonable characters for the sole purpose of making our special protagonist even more snowflake-ish. It's poor Gally, who's labeled as a \"bully\" before he's had a chance to do anything even remotely bully-ish except for staring at Thomas with dislike. To cement his unlikeability, Gally is described as physically unattractive - because in shallow books like this one if you look like a villain, you must be one. Gally, whose distrust of Thomas is perfectly logical (if any of the characters would take any time to think about it instead of singing accolades to the Special Snowflake).# The too-stupid-to-live characters. Seriously. Every few pages my reaction was - really? You guys haven't tried that? You haven't thought of this?? You haven't talked about that???? Ugh.# The action scenes that read like a video game narration. This does not work in real life - even the kind of 'real life' that involves a few dozen of teen boys stranded in a few square miles area where they successfully run a farm, a slaughterhouse and an industrial-size kitchen.# The \"big reveal\" that is simply told to us, without anyone really earning it. No, the characters do not work hard just to get the pay-off; they get told all that's happening, like a cheap trick.# The absolute lack of any suspense or motivation to help propel the plot forward. No, everything is simplistic, childish and therefore strangely light and unconcerning. There is no depth, no real substance, and no complexity. It's page-filler, easy to read, easy to forget.1.5 stars.Yawn. A frustrated yawn, at that."}, {"userName": "Cara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876075-cara", "userReview": "Reading this book + No sleep= brain shock\n. Oh more like my brain was blown into freaking little bits. I kept thinking about it after I was done. I finished it into the late hours of the night and I kept circling in my head what was going to happen next. The point is moot but I am definitely going to read the sequel The Scorch Trials.From the start as the reader we have NO idea what is happening. All Thomas can remember is his name. Not where he came from or any specific details of his life. Neither do any of the other Gladers who he meets in the beginning of the book. The place is filled with boys whose sole purpose is to try to get out of this place by solving the maze. They haven't had any luck in two years, but that may all change with Thomas's arrival. Strange things start to happen, and people are pointing fingers at Thomas. Will he be the one to get them out, or the boy who will bring them down?At first I was having a hard time getting into this book. Nobody wants to answer Thomas's questions, and I got just as frustrated as he did. I actually still don't completely understand why they didn't want to answer all his questions right away. The plot does pick up speed though and you get to meet Newt, Chuck, Minho, and Alby (all important characters in their own right). The world building is good because I got the creeps just thinking about the grievers, and I can feel the desperation but at the same time the camaraderie the guys have with each other. There is also a unique language setup that was a tad-bit confusing at first but you pick it up as Thomas does. The ending certainly is gonna give the series a big shakeup. I really want to see what Dashner has up his sleeve this time.I read this because of the good reception it was getting, but also because of a display at Barnes & Nobles. They had all these books that were hugely popular within the young adult realm and I had read all of them except, you guessed it, this one. I couldn't have any of that!Added later: Great news guys, there are making this into a movie! Here is a link to the little info that is out about the movie.

I needed a nice, clean cut from the typical YA books filled with whiny protagonists, insta-love and love triangles, and I got exactly what I asked for. This book is like a giant puzzle that you solve along with the characters. It is filled with unexpected twists and turns, full of action and I sighed every once in a while because it was so much to take in at once. It started off highly confusing, but soon took a turn for the exciting and left me hanging with so many unanswered questions; after the last page, I was still begging for more. The Maze Runner had me gripping my seat until the very end. A great and very thrilling read.Thomas was a curious, smart and brave protagonist and basically everything the Gladers needed at the time. I didn\u2019t really connect to any of the characters because they were a bit snappy and unpredictable, but I could definitely understand all the reactions and feelings. I felt all the emotions myself. I felt the sorrow, the despair, the excitement, the need for survival, everything. Though the idea of slug-like creatures didn\u2019t really appeal to me at first, I got used to the image of the deadly Grievers after a while. They ended up being quite gross and I started fearing them as well. The arrival of the girl definitely lightened things up, not much, but enough. The deaths were very predictable but they did add to the story.And that ending! Ooooh, that ending killed me! I was so happy when I read the last sentence, and then I read that freaking epilogue. That was heart-wrenching. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be a happy ending because it\u2019s a trilogy, but I didn\u2019t really know what to expect. I definitely didn\u2019t expect this.

I don\u2019t know what it is about male authors, but they can be down right infuriating. Men truly do think on a different wave length and speak another language than women. I was becoming rather frustrated with the lack of information being given, and I wasn\u2019t sure I would be able to endure that sort of aggravation for 300 plus pages. Luckily around page 60 or so, Dashner hit his stride and I became enthralled with this story.It\u2019s so difficult to write a review that divulges information about the plot without simultaneously giving the plot away. Dashner mastered the art of dolling out need to know information in spades while maintaining an air of mystery that keeps you immersed in the story, craving for more.The Maze Runner begins with Thomas finding himself memory-less, surrounded by teenage boys of varying ages, in a strange place called the Glade. Thomas immediately begins asking questions, attempting to get his bearings, though answers aren\u2019t forth coming, and the Gladers are none to helpful. Nonetheless, life doesn\u2019t seem too shabby in the Glade. There is a homestead, crops, barns filled with livestock, the sun always shines, and various supplies appear in \u201cthe box\u201d each week upon request. There even appears to be order within the Glade, though it is filled with nothing but testosterone fueled teenage boys. There appears to be only a handful of rules, 1. Never threaten your fellow Gladers, 2. Everyone must pull their weight, 3. No one is allowed in the Maze aside from runners, 4. No one is allowed in the Maze after dark. Though the rules are rather self-explanatory, their necessity becomes all to clear once Thomas is allowed to know what lurks behind the stone walls protecting the Glade. While no one knows how they came to arrive in the Glade, why they were sent, or who sent them, they all strive towards a common goal, solving the Maze and leaving the Glade. But once the first ever girl arrives into the Glade, a trigger is pulled, and the stakes for survival are raised.Despite the fact that I didn\u2019t have an emotional reaction (crying when it was clear that I was meant to), I couldn\u2019t set this book down. I wasn\u2019t scared for any of the characters, my heart didn\u2019t race, but I desperately wanted to solve the freakin mystery.

You can't help but like characters that are trapped in an almost literal Hell and somehow make the most of it to the point you secretly wish you were part of it. There's something magical in that.A story can only go so far with characters that don't really have any meaningful connection to the plot or the setting, though. Any of these guys could've been replaced for any other personality with barely any notice. I think James Dashner really squeezed the best possible plot he could out of the characters he created.The real pitfall of The Maze Runner is the writing. As Dashner might write, It's really, really bad. So bad, it leaves you feeling nothing in a lot of scenes you should feel loss or adrenaline or relief or... anything."}, {"userName": "May", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20416955-may", "userReview": "OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OOOOOOOH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOD QUIERO M\u00c1S.

Es una novela cuya pel\u00edcula sali\u00f3 el a\u00f1o pasado y que vi antes de leer el libro. Ahora que he le\u00eddo el libro puedo decir que estoy fascinada con el mundo que ha creado el autor y que nadie puede morir sin leerlo.Como comentaba, lo m\u00e1s fascinante de la saga es la ambientaci\u00f3n y el mundo que crea el autor. Sin duda la idea del laberinto no es nada original, pero s\u00ed el claro que hay en medio y la trama que se desarrolla en \u00e9l. Adem\u00e1s de los monstruos, laceradores, que crea el autor y con los que juega todo el tiempo.La trama de la novela es muy buena. Es original, tiene giros y un desenlace inesperado y que deja con muchas ganas de m\u00e1s. Me gusta la l\u00ednea argumental que sigue el autor y tambi\u00e9n c\u00f3mo entrelaza a los diferentes personajes con la trama. Me gust\u00f3 mucho la idea general y todo el desarrollo que hay en la novela.Los personajes tambi\u00e9n me encantaron. Todos los personajes masculinos tienen una buena profundidad y los protagonistas son fant\u00e1sticos. Me gusta que cada uno tenga una caracterizaci\u00f3n diferente y que tengan algunos giros inesperados.El \u00fanico personaje que no me ha convencido para nada es Teresa porque es demasiado plano. Parece jugar un papel demasiado importante casi al final y siendo, seg\u00fan la trama, un personaje clave deber\u00eda haber tenido una mayor profundidad y en s\u00ed desarrollo, porque es plan\u00edsimo.El corredor del laberinto es una novela ya muy famosa y de la que queda poco por decir, quien no la conozca es porque vive debajo de una piedra. Ten\u00eda unas alt\u00edsimas expectativas por esto mismo y las ha superado, algo poco habitual. El ritmo es fren\u00e9tico, es una novela adictiva que se bebe r\u00e1pidamente. Tiene una buena densidad que podr\u00eda hacer de esta novela algo pesado y dif\u00edcil de leer, pero sin duda el autor tiene una pluma \u00e1gil y sabe enganchar al lector.En resumen, El corredor del laberinto ha sido una novela que me ha encantado, que me ha dejado con ganas de m\u00e1s y que recomiendo a cualquier tipo de lector porque merece much\u00edsimo la pena."}, {"userName": "Kate \u2661", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15154637-kate", "userReview": "It's 1am, just finished this and it was aMAZEing, see what I did there ;)Review to come!!Review (more like gush):Where do I even start this review...Okay, so, The Maze Runner is absolutely incredible! I loved it so much!This book instantly sucked me in, when I really just got it off my shelf to look at it! Haha, I had always been a bit hesitant to read this book, because I didn't think I'd like it much... Boy, was I wrong. I even broke a book-lover rule and saw the movie first, because I was never actually sure if I'd read this! Yet, I still enjoyed the book so much, even though I knew what was going to happen! (Makes me so excited for book 2, because I don't know what's gonna happen)Reading this made me feel like it was Christmas morning, all jittery and happy. It gave me nostalgic feels even though I'd never read it before... maybe I felt a bit like I did while reading the hunger games... Idk, it's hard to place.This book caused me severe lack of sleep, not even just by reading late into the night, but also because when I wasn't reading, I was thinking or dreaming about this book! I even read it at every break I got on my biology excursion! I've never said 'just one more chapter' more in my entire reading life! Which I think is fair to say I'm pretty obsessed with it!I'm SO happy that I loved this book the way I did, because it's been soo long since I've completely and utterly enjoyed a book!

It was a great concept, and the story was compelling, the characters and plot twists interesting, and there was no limit to Dashner\u2019s creativity. My big problem was that the characters were manipulated by the story, and not the other way around. There were so many times when the characters would have figured things out. They\u2019re supposed to be brilliant kids, and yet they are continually clueless about things that are pretty obvious to the reader. And it\u2019s not like the reader has information they don\u2019t. The only reason the characters don\u2019t figure things out is because the author doesn\u2019t want them to.

Some readers felt frustration or anger at the end of The Maze Runner \u2013 too many questions left unanswered, too abrupt of a cliffhanger. I felt quite a bit of frustration as well, but for the opposite reason: I would have appreciated less questions answered, more ambiguity. I wanted less of a plunge into a rather typical post-apocalyptic adventure and more running about in a maze for reasons unknown. Although I did enjoy the actual cliffhanger.V is for Vendetta!  The characters in The Maze Runner use the idea of Vendetta to fight back, to inspire themselves, to fling themselves into the unknown. \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d is a graphic novel by Alan Moore.

The Xbox and its various successors are video game consoles. I trust you can connect the dots here.Y is for Young Adult!  I think that many of our classic and modern young adult stories together form the fables of our times. A handful of narratives that are repeated and reshaped, told through hundreds - thousands? - of different books and read by millions of readers.

The \"puzzle\" of the maze should have been solved in the first week (or at least, parts of it should), the \"monsters\" were so easy to beat that I'm still confused as to why the boys didn't kill them all sooner, and Thomas got way too much praise for merely existing. The rest of the cast had to be dumbed down to some truly paint-eating levels in order to make him look good, but the book went ahead and did that. (At one point, Thomas was actually praised for his \"brilliant\" tactic for getting around the monsters, which consisted of \"fake right, dodge left.\" Toddlers can figure that one out.)And I really have no words for that ending except: no one involved in this project should be allowed anywhere near an environmental debate. Clearly, too many lessons facts about how the planet works need to be re-taught first.To cap off the fail-cake that is this book, we also got the lovely message of \"if anyone disagrees with you and gets angry about it, call them insane.

Let's discuss.I bought this book over a year ago because of the Dystopia craze.. having read so much dystopia though, I wasn't able to pick it up. It's been a while though, and I picked it up at a time where I was excited for it which turned out for the best.I was first stricken with how fascinating the whole world concept for this books is: it's very reminiscent of The Lord of the Flies in that you have a bunch of kids desperate for life but not knowing what to do. I've always enjoyed reading and thinking about how bodies of people govern themselves, and this made an interesting study. Also, of course!, you have this epic arena: a huge maze infested with giant lizard-robot creatures and no seeming escape, it's great! But here lies my problem with this book: you understand the world within the first few pages, you pretty much understand what's going on. Therefore, I expected \"Okay, I get it! Cool.. what's going to be the plot in this interesting setting?\" .. and you don't find out for 300 pages. SERIOUSLY! Most of this book is the main character, Thomas, asking questions and NEVER getting answers. It was infuriating! I felt all this potential for the story, it honestly has such an exciting prospect, but then you learn nothing further about the world and the plot goes nowhere. A couple of people have told me that this was all necessary information needed for the sequels, and I completely disagree. It's always good to set an over arching idea with details for a series, but that shouldn't take up over 2/3rds of this book! I will not budge on my feelings that this book had a lot of wasted time merely standing around the Glade that should have been cut out to make the story an actual story: I want plot, something to follow!However, and this is where I was so happily surprised, the last hundred or so pages of this book WERE exactly what I wanted (expected). They were completely action packed, very suspenseful, and absolutely thrilling to read. I at first wondered if it would be \"too little, too late\" but my final verdict is no.. it was so very exciting that although it was close to not being good enough, it definitely brought the whole book up for me. The writing in this book was overall enjoyable: one thing I HAVE to praise is the descriptions... they were never too lengthy or distracting and they always left a clear image in my mind. A lot of the time when action scenes are described in books I'm really confused as to who is kicking who/where someone is running/what is attacking them but this writing really nailed good description. However, I do have to point to the lack of suspensefulness: I could feel that the James Dashner wanted things for the first 2/3rds of this book to feel suspenseful, but instead they felt slow, dragged out, and actually kind of annoying. Overall, it was a tough read for most of the way through, but the ending portion really made up for it. I DEFINITELY want to read the next book, The Scorch Trials, and look forward to seeing where this story progresses.. I'm scared that the slow world building won't be eradicated though because we are completely changing arena's, but we will see! I have my fingers crossed! At least I know to push through the slowness because I'll probably have an exciting ending waiting for me!Note on the epilogue: IT WAS PERFECTION. I really appreciate when an author ties of a book well, especially when it's part of a series: I don't want to be left completely hanging having no closure at the end of a book. This book did sum up really well though, it had a conclusion, this chapter ended. The epilogue gave the perfect twist though, absolutely unexpected and brilliant."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Okay so I saw the movie when it came to dvd and I loved it, but here is the faces I got when I said I hadn't read the book yet \u2193I know right?

You just end up in some place with a bunch of dudes that are calling you greenie until the next person comes up out of the ground. This is how Thomas came into this world. It would suck arse! But Thomas keeps getting vague thoughts and memories of people places and things. Not memories per se, more like feelings that he has been there before. I loved so many of these boys and Teresa when she gets there. <--- part of that sentence didn't sound right, but I digress. There seems to be one main jerk of the group and his name is Gally. He tries to cause a lot of trouble for Thomas and he does do something I will never forgive him for in the end. I will cut him down! Anyway, so they have this little farming structure set up. Everyone has jobs like the crop keeper, or the cook, or the butcher, or runner and etc and so on. At one point they bumped Thomas up as a runner because he saved some peeps and stuff.
