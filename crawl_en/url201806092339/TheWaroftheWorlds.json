The reason for this has to do more with the original book than Tom Cruise or Steven Speilburg's tendency to wittle everything, including alien attacks, down to simple family problems. In a lot of ways, \"War of the Worlds\" (2006) was a close to dead-on adaptation of the original Victorian novel. Just a few words on why you should like, or if you don't like, respect \"War of the Worlds\" as a movie:It avoids alien movie cliches:1. There are no characters (Presidents, generals, etc.) who tell you what is going on on a global scale--all information is through rumors. 2. You do not see a major city destroyed nor any iconic landmarks. 3. Instead of humanity banding together to defeat a common foe, the characters and others they interact with are left increasingly fragmented and isolated. That being said, Speilburg's \"War of the Worlds\" adapts much of the plot line and themes from the original novel. Instead of the 1950s version which pits a united front against the aliens (Cold War adapted), the original Victorian novel has a character travel isolated. Wells' narrater, like Tom Cruise, finds himself on a ferry-crossing, holed up with a panicked priest (who conflated with the artillery-man, provides us with a freaky Tim Robbins. Robbins even shares a few lines with the artillery-man). The ending is much the same, a kind of \"Now what?\" sense pervades. And of course, Morgan Freeman's opening and closings, are practically word by word from the novel. The movie is also a great window into some of the novel's most important themes. \"War of the Worlds,\" is a very Post-9/11 movie. There is the dust, the annhilation of things we find familiar, clothing floats from the sky in mimic of office paper...There is a pervading fear of complete and nonsensical annhiliation. Whereas the 1950s adaption pits humanity against an enemy, the updated version worries itself with unknown enemies who spring from the ground. And, Speilburg, not one to be subtle, has Dakota Fanning ask Tom Cruise, \"Is it the terrorists?\"That being said, the Victorian novel is a catelogue of Victorian anxieties. This is the age of colonialism, afterall, and suddenly England is beset by a much more powerful force, unexpected, and completely foreign. 'Reverse' colonialism? The aliens take England's resources, kill off its people, and even cover the landscape with alien plant-life. And perhaps the most over-arching anxiety of all: Darwin. Here we have evolution at its cruelest; then consume us (drinking our blood like in Bram Stoker's Dracula). Just when humanity seems at its lowest, nature kicks in and saves the day. The ending seems anti-climatic now, but you have to remember that H.G. Wells did not have a pop-reference that included Will Smith destroying the mother-ship. So my point is, \"War of the Worlds\" is an amazing book and good movie, and one can inform the other. \"This is not a war any more than it's a war between men and ants.\""}, {"userName": "Joey Woolfardis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4639825-joey-woolfardis", "userReview": "Read as part of The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003. The War of the Worlds goes beyond the of-the-time popular military invasion fiction, which took away the standard protagonist/antagonist arc of single characters and popped whole countries or tribes in their place, and brings down to Earth a whole new enemy at a time when science fiction did not exist and science itself was oft thought of as fiction.In Surrey, a professor is caught up in the invasion of Martians as they sweep through London and its surrounding boroughs after witnessing several explosion on the planet Mars at the Ottershaw observatory. We follow the un-named professor and his brother in first-person narrative, seeing through their eyes this invasion and the destruction caused.\nThe air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of noises-the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames.\nThe first thing one needs to reference is the radio adaptation of 1938, which was narrated by Orson Welles and caused panic due to its news-bulletin style: those listening thought it was the truth. Whilst reading the novel, there is no doubt that the imagery, style and prose of H.G. Wells purported this panic. It is written with such imagination that it's difficult not to imagine oneself standing on the side of a crater as Martians crawl sluggishly out of their spaceships.It is not often that I can forgive a book its downfalls due to the time of its writing. (It's all very well to accept that, for the most part, racism and sexism and things of that ilk were at many times in history acceptable behaviour, but enjoying a book from a period with those things in this day and age is a thing I find difficult to do.) However, in the case of The War of the Worlds I think it is vitally important to read the book with the exact time and place it was written in history to be lodged within your mind alongside every word you read.We have a primitive form of speculative fiction, the very foundations of what we now call science fiction. At the time, H.G. Wells was writing fiction that had scientific and imaginative leanings, but no-one would dare think that perhaps the fiction was not quite fiction after all. There is little mention of the Martians weaponry or technology except when it is in use: any modern-day writer of sci-fi would absolutely be telling you all about the nuts and bolts of the piece. We have primitive science, because that is what they had at the time of writing. Whilst the future may have been thought of, the idea of futuristic technology was as alien to them as the Martians and their technology are in the book.So, the excitement of the scientific exploration of futures is not to be found here. But the imagination of Wells is so beyond almost everything else that was around at the time and coupling it with popular militarist fiction means that this is an extremely important novel in the progression of English fiction. It is not surprising that Wells was, like Darwin himself, stuck inextricably between the truth of science and the tradition of religion.The story itself, if put in perspective-removed from its time period and thought of solely as a novel-is nothing special. The narrator is disjointed with his surroundings, the story disappointing in the way it ends and less dramatic and climactic than it could have been. The style of prose is lacking, the dialogue just standard and the characters just slight breezes on a warm day. In that, it would require a mere two or three stars: enjoyable, if a little boring. But this is a novel that should be remembered for when it was written.The imagination of a scientific man who is at odds with what is right and wrong. The spectacular birth of a new genre of, not only writing, but of thinking, too. The fact that even though my oestrogen levels were almost at zero, the reunion at the end made me cry my eyes out because it was written so perfectly, so unexpectedly.Of course, that film with that actor was better. Of course it was. We have perspective and technology now that means the original The War of the Worlds is pretty pathetic. It cannot possibly compete with our high standards of today, unless you have half a brain and take this novel for what it truly represents.

If you\u2019re expecting an action story about a divorced union container crane operator with a 10 year old daughter you ain\u2019t gonna find it here. They changed like 99% of everything around. As far as I could see there are only two things which are the same, one is that the Martians attack Earth in these COOL THREE LEGGED METAL 70 FOOT HIGH HEAT RAY KICK ASS DEATH MACHINES and two is that they die in the same way which I won\u2019t say here because that would be a giant spoiler but really it\u2019s a bit feeble but I guess could happen because they came from Mars which don\u2019t have bacteria. I don\u2019t do biology so I don\u2019t know if a whole PLANET can not have bacteria. Seems like also they couldn\u2019t have had YOGHURT as well, but HG Wells does not make this clear. Nor Stephen Spielberg either. Now this book version I think is not the book of the movie, I think it came first so that may explain why the movie is better, because really this book is lame. Yes more realistic because like the main guy is no Tom Cruise, but less action. What happens is that the Martians land and like fry everyone up with the DEATH HEAT RAY and send out the BLACK SMOKE to finish off anyone left alive and the main guy hops around and hides and eats really gross stuff and just sees stuff. As for instance he sees the army get a lucky shot in and kill the one single Martian but then like his buddies just wipe out the whole British army. Boom, heatray zzzzz \u2013 GONE! Oh yeah the book is set in England which I thought was strange. Why not America like the movie? Anyway just when the guy has realized that from now on we\u2019re just going to be MARTIAN FRENCH FRIES and kept in cages (when not heatrayed) then the Martians just like shrivel up and die. End of. So, in my opinion, I say watch the movie. Or you could go for the prog rock version, lol. Oh I guess I did give away the end. Okay, SPOILER \u2013 sorry. But everybody knows this story. It\u2019s like saying oh in the end Dracula dies with a steak in his arse.

M. eastern standard time. Seismograph registered shock of almost earthquake intensity occurring within a radius of twenty miles of Princeton. Please investigate. Signed, Lloyd Gray, Chief of Astronomical Division\" . . . Professor Pierson, could this occurrence possibly have something to do with the disturbances observed on the planet Mars? Martians are coming!!! Run for your lives!!! Boo!!! Hey, what has Orson Welles got that I have not got? Now that I scared you let us go back to the review. This is one of the best known science fiction stories of H.G. Wells (among with The time Machine and The Invisible Man) as well as the one of the first ones. In case you somehow missed it the book tells the tale of Martian invasion on Earth.These guys decided Mars became too cold, but luckily they have a really nice cozy planet practically next door: our own Earth. They came and proceeded to beat the crap out of humans using so-called heat ray (which strongly reminds laser weapons, except that laser was not invented at the time of the book publication). And so the fashion showI mean total destruction of humanity began starting with British Islands (I found it strange that Martian decided this place was the best landing point; by pure laws of probability Russian Empire was the obvious candidate just because they had the largest territory). Other than being the fist book that introduced the idea of alien invasion (since that time beaten to the death and beyond by pulp media) and aforementioned laser there are quite a few interesting themes in here if you read carefully: colonialism - its ugly sides, religious hypocrisy, and relations between humans and animals - usually the former kill the later. It might be the very first dystopian novel written way before the term came to be. I freely admit that the book is great, but personally I like both The time Machine and The Invisible Man better simply because I am not a big fan of dystopia. This is the only reason for one less star of the otherwise perfect rating. P.S. Who would have thought Martians were anti-vaxers?"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "I hadn't read this classic (1898!) science fiction novel since I was probably a teenager, and I didn't particularly care for it much back then, but I let myself get roped into a group read of it, partly because it's so short. And also my literary diet needs more classics. And you know? I'm glad I did. The War of the Worlds is a lot more thoughtfully written than I had remembered. In between deadly heat rays, huge tripod machines striding around the country killing everything in their path, and bloodthirsty Martians trying to take over Earth (starting with Great Britain), there's critique of colonialism, religious hypocrisy, and even how humans treat animals. The way people react in a crisis is given just as much attention as the Martians' actions.Upping my rating from 3 stars to 4.5 on reread, partly in recognition of how advanced this book was for its time in some of its concepts, and the influence it's had on the SF genre.February 2018 group read with the Non-Crunchy Classics Pantaloonless crew."}, {"userName": "Fernando", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7665532-fernando", "userReview": "\"Las obras de Mr. Wells pertenecen, sin duda, a un tiempo y un grado de conocimiento cient\u00edfico futuro muy alejado del presente, pero no completamente fuera de los l\u00edmites de lo posible.\" Julio Verne Ya lo he afirmado en rese\u00f1as anteriores. La capacidad de anticipaci\u00f3n a la tecnolog\u00eda y el futuro que ten\u00eda Herbert George Wells era ampliamente superior a la de Julio Verne a punto tal que el visionario franc\u00e9s lo admit\u00eda sin reparos. Pero adem\u00e1s de esta caracter\u00edstica tan marcada en sus novelas, Wells nos alertaba sobre los posibles peligros que involucraba a la tecnolog\u00eda en poder de los hombres, sobre los riesgos de los avances cient\u00edficos y los alcances de la ciencia sobre el planeta.Sumado a esto, es importante reconocer tambi\u00e9n que Wells profundizaba en el costado psicol\u00f3gico del ser humano ante tantos cambios inesperados y en c\u00f3mo el hombre tiene que lidiar con estos.En tan s\u00f3lo cuatro a\u00f1os, Wells hab\u00eda escrito cuatro novelas inolvidables: \"La guerra de los mundos\", \"El hombre invisible\", \"La m\u00e1quina del tiempo\" y \"La isla del Dr. Moreau\", lo que demuestra su poder\u00edo narrativo que perdura a\u00fan hasta nuestros d\u00edas.\"La Guerra de los Mundos\" no es solamente un libro sobre la invasi\u00f3n de la Tierra a partir de la llegada de los marcianos. Tiene muchos elementos m\u00e1s que la hace una novela muy entretenida para ser tan corta y, como comentara anteriormente, nos muestra otro costado: el de la reacci\u00f3n del hombre ante la p\u00e9rdida de su libertad. A lo largo de la historia, hemos conocido acerca de las distintas invasiones y en todas ellas el patr\u00f3n com\u00fan es precisamente ese, el de la libertad perdida. Usualmente pondemos el ojo en el vencedor, pero no prestamos atenci\u00f3n al vencido o dominado y en c\u00f3mo influye en \u00e9ste el hecho de ser sometido en todos los aspectos. Es sobre esa faceta en donde Wells ahonda el desarrollo de su novela, porque para ser sinceros, si reemplazamos a los habitantes de la tierra, por ejemplo con un ejemplo cualquiera, por los polacos, luego de la invasi\u00f3n nazi en 1939 a Polonia, veremos que ese sufrimiento es exactamente igual al que nos cuenta el narrador de esta historia.La opresi\u00f3n que viven los habitantes de la Tierra puede compararse a la de este pueblo o a cualquiera que haya experimentado un suceso similar. Para ello y a la par de lo que sucede con la ca\u00edda de los distintos cilindros a Inglaterra, Wells comienza a relatarnos las reacciones de los hombres que sufren el asedio y de c\u00f3mo va esto trastocando su vida.Durante el transcurso de la novela nos encontramos con grandes diferencias entre los seres humanos como sucede entre el narrador y el cura y tambi\u00e9n con el artillero. Distintas maneras de pensar nos llevan a un contrapunto interesante. En primer lugar descubrimos que ins\u00f3litamente la falta de fe y esperanza repercute totalmente en el cura, que es casualmente quien por su posici\u00f3n ante precisamente esa fe es quien m\u00e1s debe reconfortar al d\u00e9bil. En este caso no funciona y creo que se debe a una cr\u00edtica que Wells entabla hacia la Iglesia como constituci\u00f3n. Desconozco si era o no creyente pero pude notar que por momentos el narrador (que es tal vez un Wells encubierto) nos daba una imagen paranoica, fr\u00e1gil y temerosa de alguien que supuestamente debe mostrarnos exactamente lo contrario.En el caso del artillero, se desarrolla una personalidad completamente opuesta. La de aquellos hombres que bajo la influencia de la invasi\u00f3n a la que est\u00e1n sujetos intentan tomar partido para su beneficio o pactando secretas sumisiones a cambio de una traici\u00f3n a los suyos o en otros casos queriendo intentar una represalia que es imposible llevar a cabo y es ah\u00ed en donde el autor pone al descubierto nuestras defectos, ambicione o debilidades como personas.El punto del artillero es de todas maneras muy v\u00e1lido, pues \u00e9ste pone de manifiesto que la supervivencia de los seres humanos est\u00e1 ligada directamente a que entendamos que, ante un dominio tan brutal como el que ejercen los marcianos, \u00e9stos estar\u00e1n unidos o dominados. En nosotros est\u00e1 descubrir la verdad.Un dato interesante que descubr\u00ed durante el tramo final de la segunda parte es que los marcianos comienzan a rociar toda la zona con un una nube letal negra, principalmente en la ciudad de Londres que en ese libro equivale a la Nueva York de las pel\u00edculas de Hollywood, y este detalle me record\u00f3 a la de la nevada mortal con la que comienza la m\u00edtica historia gr\u00e1fica de Hector Oesterheld en \"El Eternauta\". Tal vez, a partir de esta novela haya habido alg\u00fan tipo de inspiraci\u00f3n en el autor argentino para desarrollar su historia.Para finalizar, simplemente dejo una peque\u00f1a reflexi\u00f3n e interrogante, ya que sabemos que esto es ficci\u00f3n, que la ficci\u00f3n es justamente la creaci\u00f3n de mundos a partir de la realidad, que se han escrito muchos libros sobre el tema y que se filmaron centenares de pel\u00edculas pero, si un d\u00eda nos despert\u00e1ramos con la noticia de una invasi\u00f3n extraterrestre...T\u00fa, querido/a lector/a: \u00bfc\u00f3mo reaccionar\u00edas?"}, {"userName": "Jeff ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12618229-jeff", "userReview": "One of my favorite movies growing up was the old War of the Worlds movie \u2013 the \u201850\u2019s film, not the itty-bitty Tommy remake. I had to watch it each and every time it played on television. The same running dialogue would go on inside my head: \u201cCowardly dudes, don\u2019t wave that white flag, they\u2019re Martians, they\u2019re probably color blind or something.\" \"Oops, too late, you\u2019re toast.\u201d Or \u201cMaybe the A-bomb will work this time. Nope, you\u2019re toast.\u201dI also liked to imitate the heat ray sound when I re-enacted the movie later: \u201cDododododoodododoodleydo\u201d. It was a combination of a yodel and the sound the cat would make when its tail would get caught under the rocking chair.\u201cDododododoodododoodleydo\u201d.

With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.Hmmmmm, how fucking amazing is this? Actually, the whole first chapter of this book, titled, \"THE EVE OF WAR\" is pretty amazing. Very enjoyable. The book loses something when it adopts our MC telling us about his experiences during the invasion, but Wells rescues himself with some breathtaking breakdowns of morality, ethics, war horrors, and survival. Not to mention class differences.Wells is also, like Faber in Under the Skin, using aliens and science fiction to push a vegan agenda.\"You can't be serious, Carmen. H.G. Wells was not pushing a vegan agenda.\"CARMEN: *sips coffee* *looks at you*Oh, yes, he absolutely was, and vegans of today who are interested in reading works of fiction which promote vegan lifestyles can enjoy both this book and Faber's book and perhaps incorporate them into a vegan book club. I mean, surely vegans must get tired of what can sometimes be self-righteous and pompous propaganda which exists in vegan non-fiction. Not to mention it is often fucking depressing, especially the books that talk about the suffering of animals in graphic detail. Even if something like veganism was not popular in Wells time and place, you can easily see how this is a vegan book. The book makes some (what must be at the time: earthshattering) conclusions about humankind. This is a book like The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde which, when you read it now, it seems like old hat, but in its day must have just blown people away with its radical concepts.Imagine humans NOT being the masters of all they survey. Imagine humans encountering beings smarter, stronger, and more ruthless then themselves, which see humans simply as ants, cockroaches, or rabbits - to be exterminated and/or eaten. That's what we are dealing with here, and it cannot be denied that Wells revolutionized and charged the genre of science-fiction much the way Mary Shelley did with her revolutionary, mind-blowing Frankenstein.A lot of people read FRANKENSTEIN today and are disappointed. It's so old-fashioned. It's nothing like the media trained you to think it was. It's slow, it's old. You might read WAR OF THE WORLDS or DRACULA or DR. JEKYLL and feel the same way. But you have to understand that at the time, these authors were completely slaying people's long-held beliefs and way of thinking. Some of the old sci-fi/horror classics hold up, and some don't. DR. JEKYLL is particularly weak IMO, but DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN hold up very well (IMO). I loved both and think they are still very arresting and relevant today.So how does WAR OF THE WORLDS hold up? Amazing first chapter that blows you out of the water.And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them.And before we judge them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races.Think of everything humanity does to animals, and the genocide, war, and slavery it inflicts on other human beings. Wells keeps bringing this up throughout the novel in a rare show of clear-eyed thinking about humanity, especially for an Englishman in 1898.Now, the book loses something when we start following our MC around and experiencing the invasion with him. But the book saves itself in a few ways.One, Wells's writing.Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims....Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance.He's got a lot of good writing in this book and some great turns of phrase.Secondly, he decides not only to take down humanity's vanity and confidence, but also seeks to offer commentary on religion, class differences, and morality and ethics especially in the context of war. It's staggering how much he chooses to bite off here, but such takedowns engage the reader throughout the book.He also doesn't skimp on the horror - not only the horrors and ravages of war, but the horror of the aliens and what they do to humans. It's honestly terrifying and Wells successfully scared me and made me disgusted. I think he made his MC deliberately a member of the intelligentsia instead of a soldier, because - let me tell you - this book would have been completely different if told from the POV of someone who was a combat veteran. And that's on purpose. As the soldier he meets points out to him, after you've seen some shit then shit isn't as shocking.\"I saw what was up. Most of the people were hard at it, squealing and exciting themselves. But I'm not so fond of squealing. I've been in sight of death once or twice; I'm not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst, death - it's just death. And it's the man that keeps on thinking comes through.\"The way Wells wraps up the book, the way he brings everything to a close, is also fucking brilliant. It may seem cliched or old hat NOW, but you have to realize it was mindblowing back then. Much like the concept of Jekyll/Hyde.Now. I'm not saying that just because a book has cultural relevance and significance and is a classic in its genre that it's automatically good. Because I don't believe in that shit. Instead, I found myself actually enjoying and liking this book. That doesn't happen to me with every classic. Not every classic holds up. But classics that I enjoy and hold up for me (P&P, S&S, Frankenstein, Dracula, and Jane Eyre) don't please EVERYONE. I understand that old-fashioned books, language, and plotting can be boring and stupid to modern readers. And there are classics that come off that way to me, as well. So YMMV. I've certainly read classics that I've absolutely hated, and this might be one of those for you as well. While reading this book it seemed achingly familiar to me. I think I've probably read this before. Maybe a decade ago or so, I don't know. It's also possible that this book is SO entrenched in pop culture that I just thought I'd read it, but I don't think so. But I'm going to list it here as my first reading since I can't specifically remember reading it before.I like Wells's points here. - His pushing of a vegan agenda; extraordinary for a man of his time. - His takedown of religion and interpretation of God and what God entails. Not atheist, but a super interesting viewpoint of his time, cackling that 'God is not an insurance agent' and surmising that it's equally likely that humanity's new Martian masters also pray to God and expect God's protection. - His portrayal as a curate (clergy) as a weak, spineless, helpless and selfish individual. - His takedown and analysis of class differences, especially when the MC gets into a discussion with a soldier about humanity's future. - His discussion of the horrors of war - not only what the enemy is inflicting upon you, but what war's victims end up doing to each other. His analysis of the terrible things people find themselves doing to survive, and if that can be forgiven or not when normality is restored.Those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash of rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what is wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men. But those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to elemental things, will have a wider charity.I mean, take your pick, he just slays here with his cultural and social commentary. I find him lacking and tone-deaf on the plight of women, but I can't have everything. At least not from this author. >.< LOLTL;DR - Hmmmmmmmm. Reading the sci-fi and horror classics can be very illuminating and oftentimes rewarding. That was the case here. Even though I don't think this book is a strong structurally as FRANKENSTEIN or DRACULA (the plot meanders a bit), Wells certainly hammers home not only his revolutionary and life-changing ideas, but puts forth some true literary gems.Although it isn't perfect, I am still giving it five stars. With some caveats.Also, I want to restate that this won't be for everyone. Strange night! Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house like a rat leaving its hiding place - a creature scarcely larger, an inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be hunted and killed.

But you would be wrong. Or at least, that is what history teaches us. About a hundred years before Harvard professor Robert Coles wrote his now famous article \u201cThe Disparity Between Intellect and Character,\u201d H.G. Wells made much the same observation.At the end of The War of the Worlds, the unnamed narrator returns to his house and sees the paper he had been working on before the war began. \u201cIt was a paper on the probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilizing process\u201d (194). There\u2019s one for the wastepaper basket! As with much science fiction, the aliens in The War of the Worlds reveal more about us than about them.Throughout the book, Wells compares Man with the lower animals. And it becomes increasingly uncomfortable. At the start, we are microbes under the Martians\u2019 microscope. We might be able to pass over the metaphor without much thought if only he didn\u2019t go on to compare us to monkeys, lemurs, dodo birds, bison, ants, frogs, rabbits, bees, wasps, and rats ~ animals we exploit or exterminate without compassion. The narrator doesn\u2019t fail to make the connection between the Martians\u2019 treatment of humans and our treatment of animals. When he discovers that the Martians regard human beings as food, he is able to shift his perspective and see the human diet from the point of view of an animal that is typically regarded as food: \u201cI think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit\u201d (139).Moreover, it is not only animals that we destroy. Other humans are also fair game. \u201cAnd before we judge of them too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its own inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\u201d (5).If only moral growth went hand-in-hand with intellectual growth! But apparently evolution doesn\u2019t work that way. So a look at the Martians is a look into a mirror. It is also a look into our own future. And it is a future difficult to look upon. The Martians are ugly. And not just on the outside. Evolution has turned them into little more than heads. Thanks to natural selection, their bodies function with marvelous efficiency. They need not eat, sleep, or engage in sexual intercourse. They communicate by telepathy. Through Darwinian adaptation, they lost what they did not need to survive and developed what they did need. And what they needed was intellect, not character. Heads, not hearts. Is this where our species is headed? Wells was an advocate of Darwinism and if the Martians represent the future of Man, then The War of the Worlds must be read as a cautionary tale. The Epilogue supports this interpretation:\u201cIf the Martians can reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet within its toils. Should we conquer?\u201d (198-199).Should we conquer? If we don\u2019t want to become blood-sucking heads without hearts we had better not! On the contrary, we had better learn compassion for those over whom our superior intelligence gives us power. \u201cSurely, if we have learnt nothing else, this war has taught us pity \u2014pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion\u201d (166)."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-jean", "userReview": "[the descriptions of society's rapid decline into chaos (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "As I was reading this, two thoughts struck me. The first was that this book was less about Martians than it was about how humanity views itself as the \"Kings of the Earth\". Mankind has always had this annoying tendency to think that whatever serves us is good and right, despite whatever injury is done to the Earth and any other living creature on it in obtaining whatever it is that we want. The Martian invasion served only to open our eyes to this blindness and willful ignorance. I appreciated some of the artilleryman's ideas on cohabitation, in so far as he compared the surviving humans to rodents or small animals -- the Martians (as the \"New Kings of the Earth\") will let us be, as we mean them no harm-- unless they run out of food, that is. Isn't this really how animals must see us? I think so. Too bad that's not true... Humans will hunt, kill and exploit for the sport of it, not just for survival. The invasion in the book awakens us to the fact that there is always someone bigger, badder and meaner out there to hunt humans as if we are now the animals. But I digress! My second thought was that it was really odd that all 7 of the mentioned Martian cylinders landed in England. I mean, even if we expand this to include Ireland, Scotland and Wales, we are talking about an area of 151,502 square miles. Compare this to Asia at 17,700,000 square miles or even Europe at 3,930,000 square miles. (Figures are from Google.)About 3/4 through the book, it's mentioned that other cylinders are probably wreaking havoc on other parts of the world. I suppose it must be assumed that they had some trajectory and that the cylinders were shot at the same time each day to follow it, but then why only aim at one area if world domination is your goal? In this one particular, I could not suspend my disbelief to allow for 7 out of 10 cylinders to hit such a small area of the planet.I am probably over-thinking this... I feel better after getting all of that off of my chest though! I did really enjoy the story itself, and would definitely recommend it to anyone. It's short enough so that it is not a daunting read, but it contains such a large story that it is immensely entertaining."}, {"userName": "Erin \u2615 *Proud Book Hoarder*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder", "userReview": "\"I felt no condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted me.

These martians weren't hunting cheerleaders though!While the wording style is eloquent, beautiful, it fails to hold rapt focus. I think the main issue is the story is so distant from characterization and mainly fills itself out by describing everything - martians, their instruments, the lands, the horrors, the pit.There's a few pieces of dialogue but mainly the lone traveler is kept with the company of his own mind, but still the author tells us little. The character has a wife but little else is known besides his slightly philosophical nature and definite strokes of luck and fortune. He escapes much while others just happen to not make that same fortunate escape.Being a classic written in another time, the science and plausibility isn't as advanced with its sketching as something today would be -- but it was incredibly inventive, especially for its time period. We've copied this work on art in so many ways since. Originality is something that shines for The war of the worlds - we can only hope to be suitable imitators.On the surface it is a story about the doom of man when the sky opens to release those vicious Martians - but the author enjoys later telling tales of how the human race is doomed and sort of deserves it because we have doomed others, the earth, and been unmerciful to the land, animals, and those tribes or peoples different from us. Wells raises the point of mankind ruthlessly wiping out others due to greed and savagery, without our current day giving it ample remorseful respect. Bringing up animals, here is one quote among many that points the same theme out --\"...an inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be hunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confidently to God. Surely, if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us pity -- pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion.\"H.G. Wells keeps the philosophy strong by also taking pains to show that, while the Martians are a horrifying creation we have a right to fear, we ourselves are scary to animals and other races we've conquered.Does compare the monstrosity of the Martians with mad of how we destroy the world or have taken no mercy in history on previous human tribes. When describing the horrors of the Martians feeding, the author then states, \"The bare idea of this is no doubt repulsive to us, but at the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.\"An interesting concept - especially because of the radio forecast that led to historic panic - and the creativity of its times. On the downside, the lack of characterization gives a lack of attachment for the reader other than sci-fi colored curiosity. Description only stays interesting up to a point. I've seen that some find the ending anti-climactic, but I loved it.

I knew this, but I didn't KNOW this, until I re-read his 1898 novel, The War of the Worlds: H.G. Wells was eerily and impressively ahead of his time. I'll admit, The War of the Worlds was hardly an easy read. The dispassionate and overly formal style of writing/reporting constantly dragged me back to a long ago time and place almost as foreign as Mars itself. His \"speculative philosophy\", as he put it, interweaving themes of colonialism and the subjugation of humankind as a whole, was evidently political in its foundation. But it was fascinating to recognize he also set the stage for 20th century speculative and science fiction. As a sci-fi junkie, I am grateful for his ingenious contribution to this genre.Especially remarkable were artilleryman's imaginings, which are remarkably familiar to any reader of 20th century speculative or science fiction. The artilleryman posits a Martian-controlled future, where humans survive underground (figuratively and literally) and carve out a rebellious life. He envisions humanity playing the part of an inferior or even insignificant race to the alien overlords, until such time we can develop the perfect opportunity to overthrow them. Fast forward A CENTURY, and we've got Skynet's Terminators bearing down on us.So often I find myself searching for this week's (this minute's?) next great read, but what I need to be doing is seeking out more of the classics to add to my reading list.

Sure, the monsters happened to come from Mars, but that isn't essential to the plot. They could just as easily have come from deep under the ground, from the bottom of the ocean, or from Mordor. All the story requires is that they be from Somewhere Else, and Mars fills that bill perfectly well.So, leaving aside the creatures' extraterrestrial origins, War of the Worlds succeeds on several levels. For one, it's one of the most gripping and legitimately frightening horror stories to come out of the 19th century; the intelligent, but overwhelmed and slightly unreliable narrator gives a desperate, panicky edge to the story. This suits the material perfectly: if you propose to chronicle the end of the world, a little panic goes a long way towards selling it.The story also succeeds as an ecological fable. As the story repeatedly compares the Martian invaders to humans as humans would be to rabbits or ants, the usual human view of the world as a pyramid with ourselves at the top is thrown into a new light. This is typical of Wells, as The Time Machine and The Island of Dr. Moreau are also thinly veiled parables about the philosophical issues of his day. The difference is that, unlike the class warfare fable of The Time Machine, or The Island of Dr. Moreau's exploration of evolution and what makes humans human, War of the Worlds's message still seems relevant today.For my money, this is H.G. Wells' best story, or at least the one that's aged the best. I was surprised at what an enjoyable and thought-provoking book this was - far better than any subsequent adaptations I've seen or heard.

The story is narrated by an average (if well-educated) guy who happens to see the arrival and survive, and is scrambling around trying to find food without getting seen in the process. Contra the movies, he is not heroic or important to the outcome of the invasion, which I thought an intriguing authorial choice.A couple aspects that were interesting to me:--The narrator several times mentions that how humans are feeling as the Martians prey upon them must be similar to the helplessness and fear that animals feel when we hunt and kill them. The Martians are abhorrent to us because they are killing us, and also look hideous to us, but that's perspective. From their point of view they are doing nothing wrong. I wonder if their have been any reception studies done on how Wells' contemporaries felt about this position?--I haven't heard this mentioned, but WoW is in fact an alternate-history novel, or set in a similar parallel universe, because it is mentioned in passing that this invasion occurred in the recent past and now we have all sorts of new technology thanks to remainders of Martian vehicles, and also there is greater global cooperation. Has anyone ever written a follow-up novel in this setting? It seems like such an obvious idea (especially with the end point that the Martians could attack again and Earth needs to prepare) that I cannot believe no author has done it, but I haven't encountered such a book.p.s.

Wells. Published in serial format by Pearson's Magazine from April 1897 to December of that year, the story originated after the author's relocation to the town of Woking in Surrey County. It was here that Wells also wrote his comic novel The Wheels of Chance, as well as The Invisible Man, which has now been replaced as my favorite Wells invention with this one.The novel begins on a warm summer's night in June and unfolds from the point of view of an unnamed narrator, an academic in the field of philosophy who lives with his wife in Woking, southwest of London County and bordered on the north by the River Thames. A celestial alignment of Mars, Earth and the sun has generated much interest by members of the Astronomical Exchange, among them Ogilvy, a well-known astronomer and friend of the narrator's. Ogilvy believes the possibility of life on Mars to be absurd. The narrator isn't so sure about that. Early in the morning, a \"falling star\" is reported in the skies over Berkshire, Surrey and Middlesex. Ogilvy tracks the descent of what is assumed to be a meteorite to a \"common\", or public land, near the town of Horsell. Climbing into the sand pit where the object has been buried, Ogilvy discovers a huge cylinder, which he determines to be hollow. He runs to get help and news quickly spreads of \"the dead men from Mars\". While Ogilvy and a few other men from the Astronomical Exchange begin to excavate the cylinder, the narrator clings to rational thought, doubting there might actually be any intelligent life inside. He's dispatched to secure fencing needed to hold back the crowds that have begun to converge on the site. The narrator returns at dusk in time to witness the cylinder open. Expecting to see a man, onlookers are aghast at their first glimpse of a Martian in the flesh:Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, the Gorgon group of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to greater gravitational energy of the earth--above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes--were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.A deputation including Ogilvy approaches the pit with a white flag in an attempt to communicate with the Martians. The party is met with what the narrator refers to as a \"heat-ray\", a flash of light which leaves the men charred and distorted beyond recognition. The narrator manages to flee the massacre and returns home to his wife. He's confident that the episode may all be a big misunderstanding and trusts that a company of soldiers heading to the site will sort everything out. Meanwhile, a second shooting star lights up the sky.By afternoon of the next day, guns are heard firing and the narrator observes damage to the spires and chimneys about town. Concluding their home is now in range of the Martian heat-rays, the narrator procures a horse and dog cart from the local pub owner, quickly fills it with valuables and spirits his wife to the town of Leatherhead, where her cousins live. He insists on returning the horse and cart as promised, but upon his return to Woking that night, encounters a pair of giant Martian tripods stepping through the pine trees.Higher than many houses and dangling steel tentacles, the tripods use their heat-ray to destroy the horse and cart. Through the hail and lightning of the dark, the narrator makes out the shapes of tripods on the march through the English countryside. Seeking shelter at home, he briefly takes in a soldier who initially can only mutter \"They wiped us out--simply wiped us out.\" In the morning, the narrator sets out in search of his wife in the middle of, not a war, but the extermination of mankind.The War of the Worlds is one of those classic tales that through more than a century of radio, television and film I was sure that I knew. Initially, Wells' typically British stoicism and reserve -- the narrator witnesses his mates microwaved by a Martian death ray and returns home, composes himself and tells the little lady it'll be quite all right in the morning -- kept me removed from the story. It was headed toward two stars and a box checked next to \"War of the Worlds, Wells, H.G.\"I caught up to the novel at the end of Book One, when the Narrator fishes himself out of the Thames and takes on a companion, a parish priest convinced divine retribution is at hand. The men become unwilling partners, plundering houses for food until a Martian cylinder crashes nearby and traps them. The story became much more thrilling through here, with the danger up close and personal. Instead of running, the narrator is able to study the Martians for the first time, uncovering unpleasant facts of the invader's diet.Wells' \"man on the street\" reporting -- adapted by Orson Welles for his infamous 1938 Halloween radio broadcast -- has a unique way of putting the reader right in the middle of an invasion with a remarkable amount of verisimilitude. The heroics exhibited by his narrator are thankfully limited to his ability to stay alive and observe the enemy up close, as well as use his knowledge of the humanities to give what he's experiencing context.-- Wells cites the names of so many towns and villages that a tourist could probably find their way around London by reading this book. -- Next to New York, London has been destroyed by more science fiction writers than any other city. Panic takes the heaviest toll in The War of the Worlds. The scenes where the narrator wanders the empty city, certain he's the last survivor, were chilling.-- The biology and technology of the Martians are ingeniously drawn and truly menacing. I haven't seen an alien in film or television in quite some time that were as designed as well as the Martians.-- Wells does take an unnecessary detour, shifting focus to the narrator's brother as he flees the siege of London by poisonous black smoke, but even here, Wells' impeccable writing style kept me hooked:In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all covered thickly with black dust. That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii. We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of strange and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift.I found the depictions of how rustic the England of Wells' day truly was to be captivating. Most of the country is connected by rail, but once you left the train stations, you were in the 19th century, with horse cart, carriage or bicycle the best options for travel. Without telephone, television, radio or aircraft to provide news, the reader's imagination is allowed to run amok between pages and fill in the details of the invasion."}, {"userName": "The Pirate Ghost (Formerly known as the Curmudgeon)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5555043-the-pirate-ghost-formerly-known-as-the-curmudgeon", "userReview": "[ My favorite part of this story, the H.M.S.

As a vision of Imperial Britain's place in the world it is incredibly narrow and fearful - the application of fight or flight as the only choices in international relations, but as events a few years later would show this was a way of seeing the world that was widespread across Europe.An interesting feature, particularly maybe from the perspective of empire, is that the aliens are not defeated they self-destruct in an accelerated version of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Martian Empire - if you are going to keep your empire, mere technological superiority is not enough, one needs inner vigilance too otherwise you'll dive into decadence and start mixing your bodily fluids with sub-Martians, then before you know it - you are bird food. For once then, eugenics turns out to save us all."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43881851-ron", "userReview": "More and more I have become interested in reading the predecessor classic novels like The War of the Worlds. Shamefully, this was actually my first H.G. Wells books, and although I have seen the movies, there is nothing like reading the book itself. After researching, I realized that Wells book is not the first science fiction novel, but I\u2019ve noticed hints of its influence within the pages of other novels I\u2019d read (from Kim Stanley Robinson to Stephen King).It is also relevant to horror and fear, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s lost much of its edge in that category. Evidently, Orsen Welles scared the crap out of a lot of people in 1938 during his radio broadcast using a modified version of The War of the Worlds. Since then, we have learned a lot more about Mars. Back in the late 19th century, the pictures and knowledge of the planet were fuzzy. I like that Wells used his big imagination to strike the imagination of readers. His vision of the Martians and their attack on our world is outstanding. Within the story there is also a personal story. The book speaks to human loss, but also to hope and triumph.Because I love time travel novels, I surprised even myself by choosing this as my first Wells novel, over The Time Machine. I listened to The War of the Worlds by audiobook. I tend to miss more by audio. For those of you like me, I think reading is the best choice."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "\"The War of the Worlds\" is an exciting first-person narration of a man who witnessed the Martians invading the Earth. Cylinders containing the Martians were shot from Mars and landed in England. The British army was defenseless against the Martian Tripods, three-legged fighting machines fitted out with a Heat-Ray and chemical \"Black Smoke\". The book was written in 1898, prior to World War I, but the Martian weapons were similar to lasers and chemical warfare. Wells uses the ideas of Darwin to describe the Martians who had evolved to possess huge brains.Great Britain was a colonial power when this book was published, so it was a turnabout to read that Great Britain was being attacked by a civilization far superior in technology. Streams of refugees were fleeing from the invaders. Rumors and confusion existed in the era before rapid communication.It's not surprising that \"The War of the Worlds\" has been adapted into films, comic books, games, and radio dramas. People thought that a 1938 radio drama by Orson Welles was a genuine news broadcast which incited panic in some American listeners. This science fiction classic is full of suspense and kept my interest."}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44623637-eva", "userReview": "Having read this magnificent book which was first published in 1898 (!) I cannot but feel sadness for the fact that we no longer have people whose imagination stretches that far. Who have we produced in mankind in the last couple of decades with such an advanced scientific as well as philosophical mind I wonder. H. G. Wells was ahead of his time yes, but not only in terms of technology but also in terms of human behavior. All these blockbuster movies that come out every year containing the destruction of the world from hurricanes, flouds and other species are just regurgitations of what he wrote. Where is our originality, our advancement and our gift to the later generations? This was a book read in one breath. I am generally not a fan of the descriptive novel but I traveled the streets of England as if I was there. I will definitely be reading more H.G Wells."}, {"userName": "Alex Farrand", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37663070-alex-farrand", "userReview": "3.5 Stars \u2b50\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Willa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/572915-willa", "userReview": "This book is brilliant! To think that Wells wrote it before anyone else had imagined visitors from other planets coming to Earth is simply incredible... The influence on the genre continues to this day... Well-deservedly, I might add...But not only is this book a great example of science fiction, it's also a commentary on social practices... Wells points every so often to the feelings of the humans and compares them to the feelings of 'lower' animals who must contend every day with the effects human activities have on their lives and the order they've established... It really made me pause and think about the results of dozens, maybe hundreds, of my actions every day on the world around me and its inhabitants...Isaac Asimov, in the afterword, also points out the parallels to the way natives in many lands were treated by Europeans as they explored, spread over, and colonized the world... So, Wells gives us much more than an exciting and frightful picture of a potential alien invasion, but also turns the camera on each of us, illuminating our self-centered views and ethnocentrisms..."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15292836-maria", "userReview": "[I found the rise of the Martians, their use of technology chilling as they did not want to just destroy the human race but were more interested in submitting them so they could become in essence cattle bred for nourishment. Their powerful rise destroys communication and travel across England and spreads practically immediately. No where is safe. When one is accidentally taken down, they adapt and move on to a more ruthless manner of subduing their prey. Finally, their end is upon them. It is perfectly fitting and plausible to me that they would die from exposure to the bacteria and microorganisms that we have adapted. This is a beautiful concept. It's so simple and yet so realistic.

Wells\u2019 other novels, The War of the Worlds was one of the first and greatest works of science fiction ever to be written. Even long before man had learned to fly, H.G. Wells wrote this story of the Martian attack on England. These unearthly creatures arrive in huge cylinders, from which they escape as soon as the metal is cool. The first falls near Woking and is regarded as a curiosity rather than a danger until the Martians climb out of it and kill many of the gaping crowd with a Heat-Ray. These unearthly creatures have heads four feet in diameter and colossal round bodies, and by manipulating two terrifying machines \u2013 the Handling Machine and the Fighting Machine \u2013 they are as versatile as humans and at the same time insuperable. They cause boundless destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth are powerless against them, and it looks as if the end of the World has come. But there is one factor which the Martians, in spite of their superior intelligence, have not reckoned on. It is this which brings about a miraculous conclusion to this famous work of the imagination.", "title": "The War of the Worlds", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1231000.The_War_of_the_Worlds", "average": 3.8, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1309873729l/1231000.jpg", "reviews": 5570, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/880695.H_G_Wells", "name": "H.G.
