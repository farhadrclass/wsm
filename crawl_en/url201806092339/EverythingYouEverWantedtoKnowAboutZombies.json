Sadly, I spend more time planning for the zombie apocalypse than I do my own retirement. This was a great read with tons of information that was fairly new to me. For example, I did not know that George Romero's zombies were inspired by vampires in Richard Matheson's \"I Am Legend\". Definitely news to me! Most of the information contained on surviving the Z-apocalypse could be useful in most survival scenarios after a major catastrophe but what I found especially interesting was the almost \"real feel\" to the book when the author had different \"experts\" weigh in on the zombie's physical and mental makeup and how it could affect your chances of survival, as well as the not often mentioned but still deadly effects of such things as the common cold and infection, PTSD, and other psychological torments one could find themselves facing should the undead ever decide to join the ranks of the living. The chances of the zombie apocalypse might be slim to none, but in the event that \"you're wrong and I'm right\" - this is definitely one book you'd want to have packed in your emergency kit (which, btw, will do you absolutely no good should you have it at home and the dead start rising while you're stuck in a cubicle on the other side of town)."}, {"userName": "Holden Attradies", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5973016-holden-attradies", "userReview": "Purely amazing. This is a must read for anyone into the zombie genre, be it zombie lit or otherwise. I'd rate it as a zombie lit essential right up there with Max Brooks The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection From the Living Dead and World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War.I have to admit, I had passed this up a few times at local book stores during October when it was prominently featured on Zombie end caps. Even though I saw it had a forward by Brooks (who does not give his good graces lightly) I had passed it up because of how recent it was, how all over the cover seemed, and how by the combination of title and blurbs on the back it seemed like just another quickly produced zombie guide from a publishing company trying to rack in the cash on the zombie band wagon.I was oh so wrong. Matt Mogk's book is pretty much a detailed response to all of those shenanigans (and even discusses them). It lays down with laser precision basically everything you'd want to know about zombie history and culture and is amazingly well researched (and sourced with great end note citations). It is, in short, everything I ever wanted in a guide to zombie culture.On top of that it is amazingly recent and topical, something I've not come to expect in zombie books. Fiction usually looks to the future, and books I've read like this have been heavy on decades past. But the comparisons to real world events in the book mention many things from just the last year, and at times it felt SO topical I had to remember I was reading a print book and not the most well written blog I'd ever read.For me this book which was amazing all the way through had a few stand out moments even above that. It opens with the single best definition of the modern zombie I've ever read, and then follows that by quickly and in very plain terms that leave little room for misunderstanding explaining how this modern creature came about via Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\", how these creatures got the name zombie (the name of the European release of \"Dawn of the Dead\"), and where the whole \"braiiiiins\" meme came from. The second stand out moment of the book for me is that it amazingly discusses the evolution of the ultra-modern \"living zombie\" that \"28 days later\" birthed and for the first time was able to fully convince me that yes, it is a zombie movie."}, {"userName": "Jonnah D.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4807946-jonnah-d", "userReview": "I loved it. That's all I really have to say. It's very insightful and informative. Mogk's writing style is really informative and at the same time, really entertaining. He has a certain talent of making something as serious and probable (I'm serious - I genuinely believe in the zombie apocalypse) with such a light air and a tone that will catch anyone's attention. I love how it says \"non-fiction\" because it is. I love all of the cited sources and how they come from credible sources, making everything very concrete and very, very real. And that ending line, \"what you don't know can eat you\"? Genius. Absolute genius."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10463462-kristin", "userReview": "This book is amazing.

While I understand the inability to include every zombie movie or mention in existence I do wonder why the author left out the 2010 Dylan Dog: Dead of Night style \"thinking\" zombies. Odd. I wasn't certain if I should be horrified or ecstatic that I have read, am reading, or have seen a majority of the reference material included in this book.

I like them in concept, it\u2019s a neat idea\u2026it\u2019s also extremely creepy and the possibility of a human zombie disease popping up is large enough that I take zombie survival seriously. I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m not alone, otherwise I\u2019d be weird\u2026right? Right.Anyway!! To the review. When this book says everything it means pretty much everything. It has tips for survival, facts about actual zombie like occurrences in nature (not in humans), the origin of the modern zombie, and pretty much all the zombie entertainment facts you\u2019ve ever been curious about. For a book that\u2019s only 288 pages it\u2019s pretty much packed. I personally enjoyed the \u201cknow your zombies\u201d part where it has a drawing of famous movie zombies and a little info on them, and also the humor that\u2019s put in to lighten the otherwise creepy mood. The bits on survival are actually things people don\u2019t think about and should, like the number one thing you\u2019ll need if it all goes south\u2026or which cities have the lowest population densities. It even debunks some of the most common opinions on surviving. It has facts from actual researchers and legitimate studies done around the world on various topics that can relate to an undead uprising. Some of the stuff is down right jaw dropping because you\u2019re shocked to see how close humans are to causing something terrible to happen or participating in something monstrous. Mogk makes sure to cover all basis when it comes to situations, he references movies (some really obscure) and even takes the time to explain things. You even learn what is and isn\u2019t a zombie movie. But beware! If you haven\u2019t seen the movies or shows it does have spoilers, so it could very well ruin something for you. If you are like me and forget things like that, then you\u2019ll be fine. Two of my favorite quotes from this book, though there are a lot of great ones but to give you a taste, are \u201cThat\u2019s not Uncle Bob anymore; that\u2019s just some freeloader wearing his skin and bones.\u201d and \u201cFairy tales get you killed.\u201d The first one had me laughing for a bit and I\u2019ve even used it in conversation since I read the book.The author is a guy who takes this seriously as well as he\u2019s one of the top zombie researchers out there, to put it simply\u2026he knows his crap. So if you were curious as to what zombie book out there has the most actual facts, it\u2019d probably be this one. He\u2019s also awesome enough to give you info on other books out there so that if you are craving for more zombie reading you\u2019ll know others that have great info. Overall to anyone who \u201cenjoys\u201d zombies then this is certainly one to check out, the fans of straight forward fiction might not enjoy it as much but it\u2019s still a great book.If you visit the Zombie Research Society website you can find more awesome things from Matt Mogk and colleagues. There is also a shop where you can find his and other\u2019s books, shirts, and even a membership to the society itself.

I used to have a zombie hunting license sticker on my car, I also own The Zombie Survival Guide, participated in a 5k Zombie Run, played \u201cLeft 4 Dead\u201d and I\u2019m a huge fan of the TV series \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d. I\u2019ve had this book sitting on my shelf for a couple of years and I\u2019ve only read bits and pieces of it here and there. Reading it in its entirety was a great experience, though, and I could really appreciate the cohesive knowledge Matt has compiled in this book. Zombie knowledge is considered the most logical creature knowledge to read up on as 1) it basically just encourages you to be prepared for an emergency situation and 2) it\u2019s not completely outside of the realm of possibility that something similar could actually happen. Matt does a great job setting facts straight and sharing what knowledge is out there from science to survival to pop culture. There are a surprising amount of movies I thought were about zombies, but technically aren\u2019t (and even the writers admit it!)."}, {"userName": "Edward A.

It's not as much about zombies as it is in making sure that people are prepared for any event or disaster that comes their way. After some conflicts in personality with Matt and his staff, I dissolved my local 35 person group and went on with my life. His book came out a year later and the change from using the zombie as a foil went from being a joke to being the norm. Matt is a good writer, but the book lacks from some good fact-finding and dedicated research. Interviewing Max Brooks and having quotes from George Romero every other page is filler, not a contribution. Spending chapters discussing how vampires and werewolves are different than zombies is just silly. Take out the fluff and it is a good book on preparing and mitigating risk in the event of an epidemic, disaster, or an unnatural uprising of the fetid undead."}, {"userName": "Adam Cox", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2149542-adam-cox", "userReview": "A good look at the cultural phenomenon known as zombie.

Would you know what to do if one of those stilted-walking, flesh-decaying reanimated corpses arrived at your door? If the answer to both questions is NO, then Matt Mogk\u2019s EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT ZOMBIES is a must-read if you\u2019re hoping to survive the (probably) upcoming zombie apocalypse. All of your zombie-related questions are thoroughly answered in the essential guide. And while zombie research is--technically--mostly theoretical, Mogk offers an in-depth review of the undead\u2019s history, pathology, and place in pop culture and film.As the president of the Zombie Research Society, Mogk is your best source for accurate zombie information such as: What\u2019s the proper definition of a zombie? Where did zombies originate? Which weapons work best against the undead? How do you avoid zombies? And perhaps the most important question: Can zombies really exist? (The answer to this one may surprise you.)While Mogk definitely has a sense of humor, he approaches his zombie topics in a straightforward, plausible manner. In fact, EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT ZOMBIES was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Nonfiction in 2011.So curl up on the couch this Halloween, and educate yourself about everything you ever wanted to know but--understandably--were afraid to ask about zombies.

I spend a lot of time thinking about them. Two of my favourite books ever are zombie books (World War Z, The Zombie Survival Guide). I am itching for The Walking Dead to come back on air. I love zombies. Well, not actually because zombies are horrifying. You know what I mean. This book is better than The Zombie Survival Guide. I'll let that sink in for a minute. In The Zombie Survival Guide, Max Brooks takes some creative liberties (such as knowing how zombies come into existence) in the name of entertainment. Which is fine. Great even. As I said, The Zombie Survival Guide is one of my favourite books ever. What makes Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Zombies the better book is that it is all fact. Although zombies are a fictional being, science says they aren't impossible. The book provides good insight into that.Not only does it explore the science of zombies, it gives an in depth look at all manor of zombies in popular culture - from film, literature and video games to zombie walks and zombie proms. It really is everything you wanted to know about zombies. On a scale from Totally Awesome to Horrifically Awful, I'd give it a Totally Awesome. It joins the ranks of my favourite books of all time.

There are tons of Max Brooks wannabes out in the world shelling out theories and rehashing old jokes, but this book is different. Also Max Brooks wrote the forward, and if he approves it, it passes any zombie-related test. Did I mention Max Brooks once called me \"sweetheart\" at a convention and I got a bit of the vapors? Because that happened.Anyway, this book. Mogk looks at zombies through the lenses of neuroscience, biology, disaster preparedness, and pop culture. You have a little fun with zombie hypotheticals while learning interesting facts about neuroscience, biology, disaster preparedness, and pop culture. That's the real reason this book is enjoyable instead of 300 pages of parody. It is well researched, using zombies as a focus for a wide range of discussions.The only part that was eye-rolling was when he discussed \"suspected zombie outbreaks\" of the past and mentioned Roanoke (a mystery for which circumstantial evidence is pretty high that it is not mystery) and the Anasazi cliff dwellers. It's all fun and games until you start putting actual historical events in the context of zombies.

A good companion to Max Brooks' books. Beware, though: multiple spoilers for popular zombie movies throughout (though if you're reading a book like this, you've probably seen most of them). A little more coverage on The Walking Dead would have been appropriate. Surprisingly, he misses Les Revenants altogether - though it is a lesser known zombie film, it's not entirely obscure, and should have been included as an example of the non-traditional zombie film. As well, mention of I Am Legend is made, but without much of any reference to Matheson's book and the notion that the afflicted characters - much more analogous to vampires than zombies - were also suffering from mass hysteria that caused them to fear (for example) crucifixes and holy water. Hit and miss, really. There are some excellent sections on preparedness and survival, and an interesting analysis on post-apocalyptic survival odds in various locations.

Unlike many other zombie texts which suffer from the over-inflated ego of the authors who like to put forward their own theories and ideas as widely accepted gospel. this text is ripe with references to academic texts, and zombie literature and movies, providing evidence for all the theories and ideas discussed. EYEWTKAZ covers topics including \"what are zombies?\", \"Where did they come from?\", \"Could they really exist?\" and \"Why are zombies so popular\" among others.There is, of course, a lot more depth that one could go into, but for that I would recommend reading more specialist books.

Mogk wields it like some pimpled junior high-er who found some bitchin science article but is simply unable to understand its context.I think the only way this book is valuable as a means to preparing for the \"Zombie Apocalypse\" is if the probability for it didn't approach zero. Just because something has a \"probability\" doesn't mean it's worth considering. There a certain probability that I'm currently dreaming and/or controlled by The Matrix. In calculus when a probability approaches zero, it is regarded as zero.Mogk was doing fine until he tried to bring a movie monster (collectively the walking dead are a singular entity) up as a realistic prospective threat.
