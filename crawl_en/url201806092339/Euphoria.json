American Nell Stone (who is inspired by Margaret Mead) already has a best selling book on natives of the Solomon Islands. Nell's Australian husband, Fen, is jealous of her success, and is often reproachful and competitive. He is desperate to make a name for himself, and, instead of collaborating with Nell, he keeps his work hidden. However, Fen admits to a genuine regard for his wife's work.The couple had recently studied the Mumbanyo, a frighteningly barbaric tribe, and left abruptly, at Nell's request, resigning to move to Australia to study the Aboriginal peoples. Fen wanted to stay in New Guinea; he is after a totemic flute that he learned of during their last days with the Mumbanyo, and believes that securing it is the key to his glory. However, out of love and dedication to Nell, he capitulated.Andrew Bankston is a tall, lanky, wistful anthropologist who recently failed at suicide. He met Nell and Fen quite spontaneously, and talked them out of Australia and back into New Guinea, promising to find them a stimulating tribe to study. He corrals them on his motorized boat, and helps them settle in with the Tam people, about seven hours from where he is studying with the Kionas. Periodically, he comes to visit, and their developing friendship provides much of the adventure and drama of the novel. Each of them has their own talents and approach to ethnography. Fen thrives on experience, on doing, saturating in the culture by joining the inhabitants, almost impetuously. He's a hustler, and can learn languages swiftly--\"he absorbs words like sunlight.\" Nell is a thinker with a deep empathy and imagination. Language is limited, in her estimation.\"You have to pay much more attention when you can't understand the words. Once comprehension comes, so much else falls away...words aren't always the most reliable thing.\"Andrew is an excellent theorist, who ponders the science itself.\"I find I am more interested in this question of subjectivity, and the limited lens of the anthropologist...Perhaps all science is merely self-investigation.\"The study of cultural differences by these individuals is not a tendentious prop to raise our consciousness. Rather, there's more of an allegory that coils and tightens, and ultimately astonishes. The intersection between the anthropologists and the tribes that they study is the predominant theme and the fulcrum of suspense in this story. I finished this novel a few days ago, but the parallels between the text, subject matter, and reader continue to heighten and captivate me. As the story progressed, it revealed clues that were intensified by the reader's observation of the anthropologists and the their immersion in the cultures.\"When only one person is the expert on a particular people, do we learn more about the people or the anthropologist when we read their analysis?\"And, too, there's the correlation to quantum physics that Nell and Andrew consider, i.e. that objectivity is impossible because the application of observation changes the matter being studied.Although narrated in the first person by Andrew, the journal entries by Nell provide the potent drama, often in a subtle manner of extemporaneous observation. I felt like I was living with the Tam people, and exploring their behaviors and customs.\"Fen claims that if you just let go of your brain you find another brain, the group brain, the collective brain, and that it is an exhilarating form of human connection that we have lost in our embrace of the individual except when we go to war. Which is my point exactly.\"I applaud everything about this novel--setting, characters, prose, and story. However, it is the voice of the novel--Andrew's and Nell's--that moved me the most. Their back-stories of past losses, and the disclosure of how Fen and Nell met, add dimension to the present. There's a lightness of spirit and yet a poignant acuity of their deepest thoughts and perceptions. The author avoids reductive and clich\u00e9d writing and characterizations. This was fresh, buoyant, and tender storytelling.I've read numerous novels that embrace anthropology; however, this was more fully realized than Berlinski's FIELDWORK, less conspicuous than Yanagihara's PEOPLE IN THE TREES, and not cerebrally self-conscious like Rush's MATING (although I enjoyed all of those books). Lily King's approach is more intimate, and the presence of the reader as observer is exploratory and essential. EUPHORIA is emotionally compelling sans melodrama, gripping in its taut finesse, compassion, and colossal humanity.\"And maybe I will never find it all in one culture but maybe I can find parts of it in several cultures, maybe I can piece it together like a mosaic and unveil it to the world.\""}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "As they were leaving the Mumbanyo, someone threw something at them. It bobbed a few yards from the stern of the canoe. A pale brown thing. \u2018Another dead baby,\u2019 Fen said.He had broken her glasses by then, so she didn\u2019t know if he was joking.That\u2019s the beginning of this gem! I was a goner before I knew what hit me. Don\u2019t worry, the book isn\u2019t full of dead babies, but it\u2019s full of life and gorgeous writing and intriguing characters and I can\u2019t end this sentence because I can\u2019t stop raving about this book. This is a story based on the life of anthropologist Margaret Mead, and Nell is the woman playing the part. She and her husband, Fen, are tribe-jumping, quickly packing up and taking off in canoes when things get too dicey. They\u2019re running from a wild tribe, where cannibalism is hinted at, but they settle down with a tamer tribe that will charm the pants off of you. Their culture is rich with rituals and philosophies. You don\u2019t get to know many people in the tribe, but you get to see Nell happily hang out with them. There seems to be a mutual admiration society thing going on. The tribe can tell that she not only is observing them but that she also likes them, that she is warm and kind. She relentlessly explores their everyday lives and is a maniac about keeping copious records. Her drive and passion are part of what makes this book so incredibly rich. Another researcher, Bankson, joins them (most of the story is told from his point of view), and thus begins a slow-brewing romance. The relationships among the three researchers are complicated and tense. There are times when they all share excited discussions about the research, and it\u2019s contagious. Nell is doing what she was meant to do. And you feel like you are right there beside her.There is a strong sense of place, but there aren\u2019t any overly long descriptions, yay! I hate it when the writer feels the need to describe every gorgeous, striated leaf in the place. The writer does a great job of letting us use our own imaginations to visualize the details. Some authors don\u2019t know how to do this; King is a pro. I have to laugh that I enjoyed the setting so much\u2014I\u2019m an indoor bunny who recoils from bugs, crocodiles, and heat, and yet I was totally digging this river-side living in the tropics. The setting reminded me a lot of State of Wonder, one of my favorite books, so I\u2019m sure I was predisposed to liking it.The novel was well edited except for two small things. The writer continually used the construction \u201ctry and\u201d when it should have been \u201ctry to\u201d (as in \u201cshe was going to try AND climb the ladder\u201d instead of the correct \u201cshe was going to try TO climb the ladder\u201d). It\u2019s a really common error, and an editor should have fixed it\u2014so that people like me wouldn\u2019t get all twitchy. I know, I know, can you believe I notice this kind of shit? Don\u2019t worry, I drive myself nuts, too. I will try TO refrain from this level of nit-pickiness in the future, but I\u2019ll probably fail.The other small nit is that Nell has a broken ankle but manages to climb up and down ladders. Maybe the writer should have given her a broken left wrist or something, because I just didn\u2019t buy that she could climb a ladder with a broken ankle.Still, such minor complaints. This passionate and soulful book has it all: well-developed, fascinating characters; a solid and intriguing plot; great pacing; and gorgeous language. And as an extra treat, the last paragraph is as wonderful as the first. I need to go check out King\u2019s earlier works, and I now have to check out Margaret Mead\u2019s work too. Yi yi yi, my already bloated to-read shelf groweth!"}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "I picture Lily King in her office, surrounded by a library\u2019s worth of research materials. Drafts of Euphoria are stacked in descending towers along one wall, each draft a stair-step lower. I picture a writer chipping away at her words, like a sculptor to marble, until the true work reveals itself; the words coming to life in the reader\u2019s imagination the way hard, cold stone warms like flesh under the hand. Euphoria was inspired by anthropologist Margaret Mead and her experiences along the Sepik River with her husband Reo Fortune and the British anthropologist who would become her second husband, Gregory Bateson. But the story is entirely of King\u2019s invention, including the tribes and their cultures. The novel is a feat of research, imagination, passion, and restraint. A sense of menace pervades the narrative, beginning with the first paragraphs. It is the early 1930s, and American anthropologist Nell Stone and her Australian husband Fen are fleeing the aggressive Mumbanyo tribe in a canoe when something is tossed at them. It lands near the canoe\u2019s stern but Nell can't see what it is: Fen has broken her glasses. He remarks that it\u2019s, \u201cAnother dead baby.\u201d Nell can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s joking. When her infertility and miscarriages are later revealed, Fen's caustic remark becomes unforgivably cruel. Yes, their marriage is a hot mess. Both are gifted anthropologists, but it is Nell, the author of a best-selling, controversial ethnography, \u201cThe Children of Kirakira,\u201d who garners acclaim and grant money. Fen can hardly be bothered to carry a notebook and pen. Their months with the Mumbanyo have nearly destroyed the couple physically and emotionally, and they are returning to Australia to regroup and then embark upon a study of the Aborigines. Enter Andrew Bankson, an Englishman who has been in New Guinea for years, studying the Kiona tribe. Bankson, escaping the shadow of an overbearing mother and the ghosts of two dead brothers, is on the brink of suicide. He invites the Stones to return to New Guinea, but they are aware of the competitive nature of anthropologists and fear that there\u2019s no more room in the territory for them to set up camp. Bankson, loneliness seeping from his pores, introduces the Stones to the Tam tribe and the three become a triangle of intellect and intrigue. The narrative is told in third person from Nell\u2019s perspective, in first person from Bateson\u2019s, and through Nell\u2019s journal. The alternating voices, the shifts in time, and the retrospection serve to enhance the tension. Bankson leaves clues that something terrible has happened, but the author reveals only just enough to compel the reader onto the next page, and the next. This is a novel that will make you late for work, or keep you reading far past your bedtime. The anthropologists devise an ingenious grid to classify all of human culture (riffed from a classification theory that Margaret Mead herself devised), but they are utterly incapable of understanding their own hearts. Bankson falls hard for Nell the moment he sees her and she is torn between her partnership with Fen, her ambition, and the shelter she finds in Bankson\u2019s adoration. But there is nothing maudlin about their interactions; King maintains the sexual and emotional tension like a piano wire plucked and humming. So too are the encounters between the Stones and Bankson and the tribes under their study: Tam and Kiona, respectively. These are the genius moments of Euphoria, as these three Westerners assume the role of cultural scientists with the arrogance born of ignorance. Theirs is a new science and they are eager to experience the euphoria of discovery and understanding. When a breakthrough is made, they feel they could \u201crip the stars from the sky and write the world anew.\u201d Here too there is intrigue, as Nell is allowed deeper into the female-dominated society of the Tam while Fen, with all his petty jealousy and arrogance, secretly plots to obtain his own piece of fame. Lily King had so much rich material to work with. She could have offered us a doorstop of a read, a cultural and emotional epic. Instead, she chiseled away until she reached the heart of darkness. Euphoria is all the more profound and moving for her restraint. An excellent novel."}, {"userName": "Violet wells", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells", "userReview": "To begin with I had the feeling I was really going to enjoy this. There wasn\u2019t going to be any wizardry or groundbreaking technique to this novel. Rather it seemed it would be a riveting story told by an accomplished writer with a passion for her subject and a very easy and poised prose style. Quickly there\u2019s a sense that the real tribes under scrutiny here are men and women. But I felt King could have been a little more subtle and certainly more probing with this anthropological irony. Then it began to seem a very light and breezy read but perhaps a little too light and breezy. I found myself hoping for more depth as the novel progressed, for the sifting down into deeper layers of meaning. Or something more than a love triangle in an exotic location at the advent of a world war which does make you think King wasn't unaware of the colossal commercial success of The English Patient and Out of Africa - except her writing unfortunately isn't in the same class as Ondaatje or Blixen. In the first five chapters there could be the suspicion that anthropology is just going to be used as an exotic backdrop for little more than another done-to-death love triangle. I think there\u2019s an element of everyone in the novel becoming a representative of his/her tribe \u2013 whether the tribe is nationality or sex. King is asking questions about the credibility of anthropology as a science since it is all about communication between the observer and the observed - and this is what every good novelist does, starts off asking crucial questions about the themes the novel is to investigate. I\u2019m liking the subtle use King\u2019s making of the love triangle. It isn\u2019t some cheap amphetamine she\u2019s used to increase the bloodflow of the plot. In fact I think we have little emotion invested in the will-they-won\u2019t-they? question. Rather she\u2019s showing us how infatuation/love/kinship heighten our observational prowess. It\u2019s Bankson\u2019s infatuation that makes his observations of Nell so informed and extends the reach of his sensibility which, in turn, allows him to enter into the spirit of the Kiona, an accomplishment denied to him until his imagination was fired up by his meeting with Nell and Fen. This very much in contrast to the patriarchal Victorian world\u2019s hard-boiled scientific methods of gathering and ordering data. More than half way through now and I'm still waiting for the euphoria moment when everything falls into place. At times I wonder if my disappointment isn't perhaps due to a lazy reading of the book on my part because I'm not really getting it while others are clearly getting a much richer reading experience. The research rarely feels rooted into the soil of the novel. For me the Tam still don't have a vivid identity. I'm not seeing how they spend a typical day. King is more interested in the sensational than the everyday and this, for me, is caricaturing the culture a bit. And i often feel she doesn't quite have command of her material. This might be due to the obvious problems posed by fictionalising real people. I still have the feeling she wanted to write the English Patient but was beaten to it. I think King's constantly heightening interest only to then almost immediately deflate it by dillydallying. I'm not loving the construction of this book. There is much that's interesting but I just don't feel she's making it all run together very well. I\u2019ve got a theory that if you read this novel in big daily instalments you\u2019ll enjoy it more than if you read say ten pages at every sitting. The former way of reading is perhaps to experience the novel as the sum of its parts; the latter, to experience it as more than the sum of its parts because, in a sense, you\u2019re breezing over some of those parts in your enthusiasm to read on. I\u2019ve decided to use chapter 21 to highlight how King consistently allows the tension line of this novel to go slack. By this late stage the novel should be reaching some kind of crescendo. Instead the opening page is nothing but idle chitchat. Wholly gratuitous gossip about Stalin and WH Auden. What either of these two are doing in this novel is a mystery. Then Fen has yet another snide dig at Nell. Haven\u2019t we already got the point by now? Then there\u2019s the very long winded reading of Helen\u2019s book, though not before a brief discussion about tea which allows Fen to get in another snide remark. All the stuff about Helen\u2019s book feels forced \u2013 researched material shoehorned in without much flair or subtlety. Bankson says, \u201cThe most intoxicating drug could not have had a stronger effect on me.\u201d But this is a classic example of telling, not showing. The entire section about Helen\u2019s book is prosaic telling, not showing. Once again all dramatic tension has fizzled out of the novel. King restores it at the end of the chapter when she shows how energising is the intellectual collaboration between the three \u2013 but, for me, so many chapters in the novel follow this somewhat sloppy pattern. I would argue many of the themes people have seen and praised in this novel are simply inherent in the material. Isn\u2019t it anthropology itself that invites many of the questions people have praised King for raising? The real question is, did King develop these themes? For me this was essentially an intelligent romantic novel. What most interested King was clearly the love triangle. She was at her best when dealing with the tensions uniting and separating Nell, Fen and Bankson. The best chapters for me were when the various tribes were little more than wallpaper. (It doesn\u2019t surprise me that real anthropologists found her depictions of the Sepik river tribes somewhat patchy and vague.) The real story perhaps was the egotistic male\u2019s jealousy of his female counterpart\u2019s success. The tyranny of patriarchy demanding a supporting role from the female. King offset this with the matriarchal culture of the Tam. This part worked well for me. As did the almost supernatural prophetic mirroring of Bankson and Xambun. Were there deep layers of cultural meaning emerging from the Nell-Fen-Bankson triangle? I\u2019d say nothing we learned isn\u2019t part of accepted knowledge about male/female relations of that time or so-called civilised society\u2019s attitude towards indigenous cultures. My take on the research was that it was too apparent King kneaded it to suit her needs. I deliberately kept myself ignorant of all background info on the novel while reading it but I sensed almost immediately that all the tribes were opportunistically invented. Clearly King sought to thematically relate the tribes to her story but for me her method was too simplistic and involved distorting realities. The pioneeringly feminist and too good to be true Tam and the sinister patriarchal Mambanyo mirrored the characters of Bankson and Fen in the simplistic superficiality of contrast. Maybe that was okay, maybe it wasn\u2019t. Probably a question of taste. I think the key to how much enjoyment you got out of this novel was the level of emotional investment you had in the love triangle (not the case with, for example, the English patient, where there\u2019s a lot more going on). If you were able to enjoy the anthropology as simply exotic background colour the novel as a whole was probably a more rewarding experience. For me the Kirkus prize had my expectations too high. I\u2019d say Euphoria is good high end commercial fiction and had I read it with that perspective I\u2019d have enjoyed it more. I also have the suspicion it\u2019ll be one of those novels that could be better as a film because much of what is told in the novel will be shown in a film."}, {"userName": "Debbie \"DJ\"", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj", "userReview": "Holy moly, I couldn't put down the last third of this incredible book. Review to follow...when I catch my breath!Okay, breath caught. Pretty obvious, I loved this book! Yes, it's the story of early anthrolopology, loosely based on Margaret Mead. When I started reading, I thought it was good, but also a little slow. However, once I got into the second half I literally couldn't put it down! The story revolves around three main characters, Nell, her husband Fen, and fellow anthropologist Bankson. What blew me away was how I felt like I was seeing with my own eyes, native cultures never before seen, never touched by anything or anyone outside of their own society. Here's a quote from early on. \" Anthropology at the time was in transition, moving away from the study of men dead and gone to the study of living people and slowly letting go of the rigid belief that the natural inevitable culmination of every society is the Western model.\" Huh, almost a century later, and is this not still our rigid belief?Just imagine, everything about the way we live has been shaped and designed by the society we live in. Viewing these primitive cultures showed me just how precarious a society is, how different it could be. Some early societies were run by women, some shared lovers, some were fierce and territorial. So many possibilities!Also, I really loved how Lilly King created a narrative between her characters. How their lives become deeply involved with one another. How Nell did not want to be possessed in love, and yet married a man who does just that. One that breaks her down in every way. Okay, and just a shout out to yesterday's news of legalized gay marriage, the story has a subtile reference to how she was in love with a woman before she married, one who she continued to write to often throughout the book.Wonderful read, highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-jen", "userReview": "Euphoria is my new favourite read of 2015. The title itself captivated me until the story grabbed and pulled at me and I, too, felt intense pleasure and well being. It\u2019s New Guinea circa 1932. Three anthropologists - Nell and Fen, a couple, and Andrew who travels solo, meet up at a Christmas party after having travelled to the inner most remote areas of the region seeking out tribes and attempting to decipher cultures. This friendship creates an opportunity to shed the loneliness and isolation that comes from spending months away from western civilization, however the costs are tragic.

Absolutely with Euphoria! I was completely transported to the setting in New Guinea and three days after finishing I\u2019m still thinking about it. The book is loosely based on the lives of anthropologists, Margaret Mead and her first and second husbands, and left me wanting to know more about each of them. I say loosely based because the author added her own twist to the story that tugged at my heartstrings. But regardless of who they were, I loved these fascinating characters that were created in this book. The character, Bankson, stole my heart from the outset. The story is told mostly from his perspective, but also through letters from Nell that added a layer of intimacy. And then there was Fen, Nell\u2019s husband, whose less than favorable traits made me like him just for the tension he created. Although the aspects involving the study of anthropology and the tribal cultures they studied were highly intriguing, one need not be a fan of historical fiction to appreciate this amazing story. It was the relationship that developed between the three anthropologists and the qualities they contributed to their work that propelled the story. You know with \u201clove triangle\u201d in the blurb things are bound to get juicy, but the romance is tastefully done and even the most moralistic of readers will be immersed in their passions\u2026and something about it was so timeless I kept forgetting it was the 1930s.

This is not historical fiction in the sense of trying to recreate a possibly real version of actual events, but a use of a historical figures and situations as a launching pad for an imagined story. How does the interplay between the subjective and objective work out for anthropologists embedded for long periods within an alien culture? And when it comes to trying to uncover universal truths about gender roles in societies, how does that effort intersect with the struggle the scientists themselves are having with their own personal solution and the challenges of a love triangle? If that all sounds academic on the one hand or a salacious invasion and undermining of the integrity of Mead\u2019s work, never fear. Above all this is a story of the regenerative power of love. The lead character, named Nell, is rendered as a humane woman and dedicated scientist, full of energy, vision, and compassion. She is fascinated how the tribe (fictionally named the \u201cTam\u201d) seems to provide a feminist model where women play a dominant role in fishing and in trade relations and allows them to choose when and who to marry, while the men are more involved in crafts and ceremonies. We get this little window into her motivation to understand a relatively peaceful people with elements of a gender role reversal:As a little girl in bed at night, when other girls were wishing for ponies or roller skates, she wished for a band of gypsies to climb up to her window and take her away with them to teach her their language and their customs. \u2026Always in her mind there had been the belief that somewhere on earth there was a better way to live, and that she would find it.Her husband, Fen (Reo Fortune as the model), comes off as selfish, petulant, and jealous of her fame from her book on the liberated adolescence of a Melanesian tribe (aka Mead\u2019s \u201cComing of Age in Samoa\u201d). But he\u2019s got verve and humor, and often puts her ideas to useful criticism, such as pointing out how the gender roles observed might be a temporary during recovery from being victims of warfare with a neighboring tribe. While Nell works on the tribe\u2019s economics, food, social structure, and child rearing, he\u2019s supposed to be studying their religion, rituals, warfare, and geneology. The trouble is, he\u2019s not pulling his weight:Fen didn\u2019t want to study the natives; he wanted to be a native. His attraction to anthropology was not to puzzle out the story of humanity. It was not ontological. It was to live without shoes and eat from his hands and fart in public.Is interest lay in experiencing, in doing. Thinking was derivative. Dull. The opposite of living.Into Nell's unstable situation another man arrives, the Brit Andrew Bateman (aka Gregory Bateson, Mead's future third husband). In his frustration over his lack of progress in understanding a warrior tribe and depression from loneliness, he has helped place Nell and Fen with the relatively nearby Tam so he can have some colleagues to visit. His affinity for Nell is pretty electric, and the mutual ferment of their ideas are exciting to experience in King\u2019s narrative. I won\u2019t spoil any fun over how this progresses or drama in Fen\u2019s reactions. However, I will share a couple of passages on how their friendship shaped their perspectives on their work. For example, Bateman is eager to get at the significance of ritual transvestism and homosexuality in his tribe\u2019s celebration of war victories, she advises him to ask them directly what that means to them:\u201cThe meaning is inside them. You just have to pull it out.\u201d\u2026Observe, observe, observe, I\u2019d always been instructed. Nothing about sharing your findings or eliciting analysis from the subjects themselves. \u201cWouldn\u2019t this approach create a self-consciousness in the subject that would then alter the results?\u201d\u201cI think observing without sharing the observations creates an atmosphere of extreme artificiality. They don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re there. If you are open with them, everybody becomes more relaxed and honest.\u201dIn another journal entry she has just awakened from a dream about \u201cHelen\u201d, a fictional version of Mead\u2019s mentor Ruth Benedict, who she had a brief affair with near the time Fen was entering her life:I want too much. I always have.And all the while I am aware of a larger despair, as of Helen & I are vessels for the despair of all women and many men too. Who are we and where are we going? Why are we, with all our \u201cprogress,\u201d so limited in understanding & sympathy & the ability to give each other real freedom? Why with our emphasis on the individual are we so blinded by the urge to conform? \u2026The world\u2014and really I mean the West\u2014has no interest in change or self-improvement and my role in it seems to me on a dark day like today is merely to document these oddball cultures in the nick of time, just before Western mining and agriculture annihilates them. And then I fear that this awareness of their impending doom alters my observations, laces all of it with a morose nostalgia.This mood is glacial, gathers up all the debris as it rolls through: my marriage, my work, the fate of the world, Helen, the ache for a child, even Bankson, a man I knew for 4 days and may easily never see again. All these pulls on me that cancel one another out like an algebraic equation I can\u2019t solve.Despite the inevitable strife among the threesome, there is a wonderful point in the story when they work together on a euphoric epipany of ideas as they try to map various cultures according to dominant sets of characterics; i.e. possessive, aggressive; caring yielding; pragmatic, managerial; creative, nonconformist. Should they map genders separately? Could the scheme work for individual personality types? I loved that section.All this gave me a satisfying illusion of experiencing Mead as a heroic human being and not the scientist who got discredited for biased reporting on the Samoans. I used Wiki to catch up on the status of attacks on her Edenic account of the Samoans and was surprised there was substantial defense of her conclusions. The work is referred to here as shocking the Americans with its portrayal of their liberal approach to child rearing (\u201cThey were astounded by Kirakira children paddling in boats alone at age three, still sucking on their mothers\u2019 breasts at age five, and, yes, disappearing into the forest or down onto the beach with a lover of either sex at age thirteen.\u201d) Personally, I was more interested in the representation of Bateson, whose later application of cybernetic systems theory to social behavior fascinated me when I was a student and researcher in the biology of aggression in animals. And his book of essays and metadialogues, \u201cSteps to an Ecology of Mind\u201d, was popular with us hippie types in the 70s and adapted for groovy theories of mental health and illness at the time by the likes of John Lily and R.D. Laing. This reading makes me hunger more for anthropological fiction, including \u201cMating\u201d by Norman Rush and \u201cThe Bone People\u201d by Keri Hulme. I also want to pursue more about early work on New Guinea tribes before they were changed irreversibly by contact with the West, including Bateson\u2019s \u201cNaven: A Survey of the Problems Suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe Drawn from Three Points of View\u201d (1958) and Peter Matthiessen\u2019s \u201cUnder the Mountain Wall: A Chronicle of Two Seasons in the Stone Age\u201d (1962).Bateson, Mead, and Fortune in 1933"}, {"userName": "Glenn Sumi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi", "userReview": "I don\u2019t know much about cultural anthropology, and only vaguely recognize the name Margaret Mead (apparently her work is considered \u201cold-fashioned\u201d and \u201cquaint\u201d in current academic circles), but Lily King\u2019s compact and brilliant novel has now made me curious about both. The book was inspired by the few months in 1933 in which Mead, an American, her second husband Reo Fortune, an Australian, and Gregory Bateson (an Englishman, who would become her third husband) spent together on the Sepik River in New Guinea. When we first meet Nell (based on Mead) and Fen (Fortune), they\u2019re exhausted, having just toiled for a year and a half unsuccessfully studying other native tribes, including five months with the violent Mumbanyos, who kill their first-borns and have fathers copulate with their daughters at seven or eight. There are huge cracks in the couple\u2019s relationship, some concerning their failure to conceive, some from Nell\u2019s recent success with a bestseller on anthropology, which has made Fen frustrated and jealous.Then, at a Christmas party run by colonials \u2013 a fine opportunity for King to provide some sharp, efficient portraits of that society \u2013 the couple run into fellow anthropologist Andrew Bankson (modeled on Bateson). Lonely, despairing and suicidal, Bankson agrees to show the two some tribes up the Sepik River. Little does he know that studying the Tam, a group run by powerful women, will irrevocably alter all of their lives.King\u2019s decision to have Bankson narrate the book is a stroke of genius. He\u2019s an outsider figure with a tragic history: both of his older brothers have died (one in the war, one to suicide), and he\u2019s always been a disappointment to his family, who don\u2019t consider his field of research to be actual science. So he\u2019s hungry for a substitute family, not to mention companionship and professional stimulus that will spark his own research. Because he has limited access to the tribe Nell and Fen are studying, what he witnesses is limited, and we have to do the work of connecting episodes and judge whether we can trust his observations.Also included are excerpts from Nell\u2019s journals, so we get glimpses into her work and her complex feelings for the two men, as well as her memories of another colleague and former lover, Helen.There are so many joys in this book: watching three vastly different approaches to the then nascent field of anthropology (the fact that they're from different cultures is obviously significant); seeing a love triangle emerge; and, of course, meeting the various people they\u2019re studying, which include a tribe leader who was recently exploited by colonials by working in a mine.There are some fascinating themes about love, competition, companionship, war and \u2013 for lack of a better expression \u2013 why people do the things they do.Underlying everything is this question: Who's more civilized, the people studying so-called savages \u2013 and often resorting to deception to do it \u2013 or the \"savages\" themselves?There\u2019s also a lovely repeated image, drawn I think from the poet Amy Lowell, about two kinds of love: the intoxicating flush that comes with wine and the comforting sustenance provided by bread. King\u2019s deeply satisfying book offers up both wine and bread. The ending feels a little abrupt, but, as the saying goes, it's better to leave people wanting more, not less. And I'll definitely be looking for more of King's work."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "[The woman DIES HAVING A MISCARRIAGE on the ship back to New York City, and her Australian husband vanishes forver.

At its center, the novel follows three young anthropologists and the very strange romantic triangle that takes place between them in the early 1930\u2019s during a short period of time when their lives and careers intersected along the Sepik River in New Guinea. Lily King based the main three characters, Nell Stone, Fenwick Schuyler & Andrew Bankson, on the lives of pioneer anthropologist Margaret Mead and her 2nd and 3rd husbands, Reo Fortune & Gregory Bateson.Nell is an American, who is already well known for having published a rather controversial book called \u201cChildren of the Kirakira\u201d, her husband Fen is an Australian, who\u2019s very envious of his wife\u2019s accomplishments, and Bankson is a British anthropologist who has survived a suicide attempt.Bankson is the main narrator, but Nell\u2019s diary entries are intertwined as part of his narrative and somehow the author makes this work beautifully. If anything this structure enhances the suspense and sense of foreboding that are present from the beginning of the book.I adored the characters of Nell and Bankson. When they met, there\u2019s an immediate connection between them, both romantically and intellectually. They seem to complement and respect each other, something that Fen is unable to provide for Nell, since he feels constantly threatened by his wife\u2019s success.There are times when if sounds as if Nell believes that a relationship with Bankson could help balance her broken marriage, although I am not sure that is clear how exactly this was supposed to work. She is also obsessed with the idea of becoming a mother, so this also plays an important part of her psyche and motivations.Euphoria gave me the opportunity to learn a little bit about Anthropology at a time when it was an emerging science, so to me the most fascinating part of the book is to be there as new theories and ideas take form in the minds of these young scientists. When it comes to Anthropology, these people were developing theories while observing human behavior, and nothing had been written yet.And what a delight it is to experience the passion and dedication they show while observing these tribes with different traditions and social structures, compare to our Western way of life.You should know that this is not a scientific book of course, but science provides the tapestry where the novel develops, and the character\u2019s ambitions and pursuit of fame are intrinsically tied to the story at large and its tragic conclusion.Euphoria\u2019s title comes from Nell\u2019s description of \u201cthat moment two months in, when you think you\u2019ve finally got a handle on the place,\u201d inevitably \u201cfollowed by the complete despair of ever understanding anything\u201d. There are a couple of times in the book where Nell, Fen & Bankson, work very well together, they have these brainstorming sessions that feel so intense, it\u2019s almost as if they are in a trance.So I love everything about this book, from its cover and title, to the characters, the sensual tension, the feminist undertones and its poignant portrait of a time when scientists were sort of celebrities and were much more part of pop culture. Achieving success as a scientist provided a path to glory, fame and immortality in a way that I believe no longer describes how society looks at scientists today (with a few exceptions of course).I should say, that I enjoyed both of the audiobook narrators immensely, their performances certainly helped enhance the story for me.\nAugust 20, 1932 New Yorker Cover described by Bankson towards the end of the book"}, {"userName": "Bonnie Brody", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630898-bonnie-brody", "userReview": "I had trouble getting through this book. I found the story rather boring and the characters only partially developed. The historic significance of cultural anthropology in New Guinea during the 1930's was very interesting as was the protagonist's character being based on Margaret Mead. This created the groundwork for an interesting historical fiction. Ms. King appears to have difficulty differentiating between an ethnographic field study as opposed to a treatise on a particular tribe. Ethnographers are silent observers who enter a domain and try to learn about it from the inside out. This is what the two main characters hoped to attain with their study of the Tam. However, what they achieved was closer to a treatise.Nel Stone and her husband, Fen, have been married for about three years when they meet another anthropologist in New Guinea - Bankson. Bankson is recuperating from a failed suicide attempt and does his best to help out Nell and Fen, who are determined to leave New Guinea unless they can come up with the right type of tribe to study. Bankson is studying the Kiona and he sets Fen and Nell up with with the Tam.This threesome has a difficult dynamic. It is obvious from the outset that Bankson is smitten with Nell despite her having malaria, a broken ankle and sores all over her body. Fen does not show the least bit of jealousy and it is interesting to find out what occurs between Nel and Bankson.I enjoyed the parts about the indigenous people and their lifestyle.

The three meet by chance and their lives become entwined, not so much by chance. There are so many layers of behavior in this novel---it is structured beautifully. There are the anthropologists of course, and the various tribes involved. But then there are the interactions amongst the three scientists and all of their motivations and emotions. The narrative voice shifts from Bankston to Nell and back in a way that gives a full picture of most of the physical action.

It paints an incomplete portrait of tribes in New Guinea and of an anthropologist\u2019s fieldwork. The \u201cpassionate love triangle\u201d promised in the summary is quite unpassionate and more of a side plot. This love triangle also doesn\u2019t threaten the three main characters\u2019 lives, careers, and bonds, as the summary states. Here\u2019s a perfect example of a book that\u2019s won a handful of prizes but isn\u2019t necessarily deserving of all the accolades.A book about anthropologists in the 1930s ought to transport and educate, but Euphoria does neither very well. The reader is too often told what\u2019s happening in the tribes, not placed in the center of any action. One prime example is when one character recklessly sets off on a life-endangering mission and returns with tragic news. The reader isn\u2019t brought along on that mission; she simply sees this character leave in a boat, then return. Herein lies one of Euphoria\u2019s biggest flaws. It lacks drama. There\u2019s no suspense and little tension. It\u2019s a passively told story in which the three anthropologists, Nell (loosely based on Margaret Mead), her husband Fen, and their friend Bankson report to the reader. The tribal scenes that are depicted lack the kind of color and energy that would make this story powerful on a deeply emotional level. There\u2019s a remove, the feeling of impassively observing, whether the scene is Nell sitting cross-legged in her house interacting with the natives or a woman struggling to give birth on a beach. The love triangle lurking in the background is problematic not just because it lacks intensity but because it involves three characters King failed to make authentically human. Probably because this story was inspired by the life of Margaret Mead, King devoted most of her attention to Nell. Nell is therefore fleshed out pretty well; however, King gave surprisingly short shrift to Nell\u2019s husband Fen. He\u2019s a cardboard character who\u2019s never not an uncaring husband and often an uninterested anthropologist who increasingly annoys Nell. When he gets jealous, viciousness rises to the surface in a flash. Nell\u2019s lover, Bankson, by comparison, is sensitive, gentle, lonely, and as passionate about anthropology as Nell is. It\u2019s impossible not to feel sorry for him when he expresses how lonely he often feels and to not adore how he treats Nell. It seems time and again, when a writer crafts a love triangle involving married people, this is how it goes; to make an extramarital affair palatable to the reader, it\u2019s essential that the cheated-on spouse be a one-dimensional jerk while the lover is as close to perfect as a human being can be. Euphoria does have great writing going for it, and this is where some of the accolades no doubt come from. King\u2019s writing style is outstanding, sparing but not simplistic, sophisticated but not at all flowery. Bankson is a deeply lonely and sometimes hopeless man, and King also did a good job making the reader really feel what he feels:Nell and Fen had chased away my thoughts of suicide. But what had they left me with? Fierce desires, a great tide of feeling of which I could make little sense, an ache that seemed to have no name but want. I want. Intransitive. No object. It was the opposite of wanting to die. But it was scarcely more bearable.Pacing, too, is even, albeit slow because of the lack of drama and an underdeveloped love story that gathers speed too late in the story. The ending is, fortunately, satisfying--emotional and memorable. This is not the book to read to gain insight into anthropological fieldwork and tribal life. A better choice for that would be Dancing Skeletons: Life and Death in West Africa. Readers seeking a romance in an exotic setting also should opt for something else.

Set in the 1930\u2019s Territory of New Guinea, the setting is exotic and the various cultures in the region are intriguing. I became immediately interested in learning about the tribes living along the Sepik River right along with the fictionalized characters Nell Stone and her husband Fen, and the depressed and isolated Andrew Bankson. These three are drawn to one another; and their interactions, both professionally and romantically, are well developed and quite irresistible. I admired Nell and could feel such empathy for her at times as she struggled not just to understand the people of New Guinea, but humanity itself. \u201cI think above all else it is freedom I search for in my work, in these far-flung places, to find a group of people who give each other the room to be in whatever way they need to be. And maybe I will never find it all in one culture but maybe I find parts of it in several cultures, maybe I can piece it together like a mosaic and unveil it to the world.\u201d The novel is told from Bankson\u2019s point of view, which I found very appealing as his character was more approachable to me and lent an air of nostalgia to the story. Snippets of Nell Stone\u2019s diary entries are also interspersed throughout and add additional perspective to the narrative. Jealousy festers and eventually erupts, violence ensues, and the safety of the threesome becomes threatened and their work halted. I can\u2019t help but think that while we try to penetrate the mysteries of those persons and customs unknown to us, we don\u2019t always understand those that are closest to us either. \u201cI've always been able to see the savageness beneath the veneer of society. It's not so very far beneath the surface, no matter where you go.\u201d This as well as many other penetrating insights provided for a very thought-provoking read. Beautiful prose, tension, haunting atmosphere, and poignant conclusion, make this book stand out in my mind and I believe it will do so for some time to come.

Bankson and his brothers are the tragic products of life energy spent in pleasing others and in the senseless pursuit of outward approval. Enter Nell Stone and her Australian husband Fen. At last, Branson can lift his eyes upward and crawl painsakingly out of his downward spiral. Nell engages him in a true reflection of himself. Does Bankson serve as a genuine relationship for Nell or as simply a diversion from her controlling, over-bearing husband?The setting in New Guinea highlights the work of anthropologists of the time period. The culture, demeanor, and ritualistic practices of the various tribes along the river make and break the lives of Andrew, Nell, and Fen. Being observationalists of the daily lives of these tribes comes with great sacrifice. The physical and emotional toll comes to the forefront.But it is the very personal encounters of Andrew, Nell, and Fen that weave their way throughout this book.

Apparently it\u2019s based on the lives of Margaret Mead and two of her husbands, but knowledge of the real-life antecedents is unnecessary; this book is its own intense, self-contained world. Two other novels I\u2019ve read in the past few years, \nThe People in the Trees\n by Hanya Yanigahara and State of Wonder by Ann Patchett, have very similar themes of tribal savagery vs. Western \u2018civilization\u2019, but this for me was much the most psychologically satisfying adventure tale of the three.The narration struck me as very interesting: you\u2019re convinced it\u2019s from a third-person omniscient perspective until the very last sentence of the first chapter, when you realize it\u2019s actually from Andy Bankson\u2019s first-person point-of-view. Nell\u2019s field journals are then a way of interspersing her own thoughts (though I reckon having excerpts from her published books could have been another strategy for introducing a different voice and register). Bankson (the Englishman) is a melancholy and introspective narrator: \u201cI find I am more and more interested in this question of subjectivity, of the limited lens of the anthropologist, than I am in the traditions and habits of the Kiona. Perhaps all science is merely self-investigation.\u201dNell (the Margaret Mead character) is wonderfully plucky \u2013 observant and forceful, yet lovable for her utter enthusiasm for her work.

The natives that got on the boat wore necklaces made of boar and jaguar teeth and were chewing on the remains of a missionary that they had met on their way to the boat. Not really, but it sounded good. I want a necklace with boar and jaguar teeth, but with feathers too. (Actually, their necklaces are made with cowrie shells, and eBay sells them, but I prefer the boar and jaguar teeth in my story.)Now I know a lot of people really liked this book, but when you get old, well, when some people get old, and I am one of those some people, they are tired of reading about arguments between couples, as well their extramarital affairs. It was obvious that Nell felt beneath the Lily White Women and didn\u2019t even like their cattiness. She thinks this or gathers it from their talk or behavior that she looks kind of ratty, so to impress them she tells them that she has a desk at her office. Desks are impressive. Then it is mentioned that her husband broke her glasses. I thought, \u201cWas this accidental?\u201d The book didn\u2019t say, but then her husband begins verbally abusing her, so I am going to make a good guess and say that he hit her in the face and broke her glasses. This has the makings of a love life gone wrong. So, now, after buying the book, I decided to read the two star reviews. One reviewer mentioned that the book talked about the native children having sex in the bushes. What? Children having sex in the bushes? Did they hide themselves due to shame? Afterwards did they make clothing out of fig leaves? Well, these are things that anthropologists find interesting: the sex life of indigenous people. And then they compare it to their Christian upbringing and wonder what they are missing in their own sex lives. Now as for me, I really don\u2019t care one way or another about the sex life of the two-legged, four-legged, or even lizards with long tails.So I read on, and this is where many readers will find the book interesting: Nell has sex with her husband, and the book is very explicit, but this is where I decided get off the boat going nowhere and to pick up another book about New Guinea. \u201cLost in Shangri-la.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Early 1930's finds Banks on living with the Kiona tribe in New Guineas. Depressed due to his solitude and loneliness, he tries to take his own life, an attempt that fails. Nell Stone and her husband Fen, have just left the tribe, a very violent one, that they have been studying. Bankson finds them a tribe on the Sepik river, an hour away from the Kiona by boat.This was an extremely interesting read, the tribal customs, their rituals and beliefs, the way they related to each other are all displayed in this well researched novel. There is jealousy, Nell has published and her book has created quite a stir in academic circles, a fact Fen resents. There is a betrayal when Fen does something unpardonable and they are forced to flee. There is competition, as all three are ardent anthropologists, and lastly there is greed and a forbidden love. In immersive prose, King has written a wonderful story loosely based on the lives of Margaret Mead and her second and third husbands, all successful in their own right.I have not read many books, if any, on anthropology, so knew little about these people I was reading about. This book fascinated me enough to acquire the book Intertwined Lives: Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Their Circle, which I hope to get to soon. My only complaint is that I wish an author's note was included."}, {"userName": "Leanne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5873788-leanne", "userReview": "I don't think I really even knew what anthropology was until I read Euphoria. I had just lumped it in with archeology and dismissed it as the study of something old and kind of boring and never really thought about it. Turns out I was wrong on both counts, because it really has nothing to do with archeology and it's also quite fascinating. It helps that the book is amazingly well-researched and seems so assured on the topic - in fact, I don't think I've ever read something that so seamlessly blends such a sizable amount of information on a specific topic with emotion without being dull as dirt (though I do tend to shy away from overtly intellectual fiction, so I may not be the best judge of that!) It's full of heart and enthusiasm and both Nell and Bankson are highly likeable narrators and characters. The setting is beautifully drawn and the tribes are intriguing and complex - as someone who is used to a typical middle class upbringing and has very Western views on everything, it was very much an eye-opener. That's not to say it's perfect - I could have used another hundred pages to delve into each character's past more, especially since there were certain key events that happened before the main narrative timeline that were glossed over or alluded to very vaguely. In fact, there were a few things I had no idea even happened until I started sifting through other reviews!Definitely a pleasant surprise overall - not likely something I would have chosen myself, but thanks to a recommendation from one of my favourite authors and various Goodreads friends, it might become one of my favourite reads of the year."}, {"userName": "Sara Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10574968-sara-nelson", "userReview": "If I tell you that Euphoria is a novel loosely based on the life of the anthropologist Margaret Mead, your eyes will start to glaze over. Well, they shouldn\u2019t--not when the novel is as wonderful as this one. Its both romantic and intelligent, a combination you don\u2019t need to be a scientist to know doesn\u2019t appear often in nature. Mead, a controversial character in real life, is here transmuted into the equally complex (and somewhat sickly) Nell Stone, who has made a reputation for herself by studying native tribes in New Guinea. Her husband, also an anthropologist, is more jealous than dutiful, although he does manage to make her feel inadequate for failing to produce a baby. Enter a charming-but-tortured third anthropologist, who at times seems to be unsure to which of his new friends he\u2019s more attracted. Sparks of the emotional and sexual kind fly, but what\u2019s even more interesting is the portrait of a growing friendship based at least partly on philosophy and attitudes toward \u201cprimitive\u201d cultures. You know from the beginning that some bad things are going to happen, but it is to King\u2019s great credit (and the fact that she changes some of the events in Mead\u2019s life) that you can\u2019t really guess what they are. This is the best kind of historical novel--the kind that sent me running to read more about its real-life inspiration"}, {"userName": "Mona", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7020601-mona", "userReview": "Fascinating Novel Inspired by the Life of Margaret MeadApparently Lily King got the idea for this absorbing short novel from a biography of anthropologist Margaret Mead.Mead has gone out of fashion. In this hypersexualized age of social media oversharing and selfies, it's hard to imagine how revolutionary her work was at the time. But it was. Her studies of adolescent sexuality in the South Pacific were jaw dropping at the time of publication.The time frame is around 1933.The characters are based on those in Mead's life. So is the core of this novel, although of course, it's fiction and the story turns out very differently than Mead's did.Nell Stone is clearly a fictionalized version of Mead herself. Her husband in the book, macho, defensive, flamboyant Australian Schuyler Fenwick (\"Fen\") corresponds to Mead's second husband, New Zealand anthropologist Reo Fortune.Andrew Bankson, the reserved and sensitive British anthropologist, is the novel's version of Mead's third husband, Gregory Bateson.Helen Benjamin, an off-stage character who never actually appears in person, is the fictional version of famous anthropologist Ruth Benedict.The book starts off with Nell and Fen returning, sick and exhausted, from an unsuccessful expedition into the bush. Their marriage isn't faring so well either. Nell is starting to become famous. Her books have sold well. Fen resents being in his wife's shadow. They run into Andrew Bankson, whose research on a New Guinea tribe is stalled and going nowhere. He's spent nearly two years alone in the jungle. Even his recent suicide attempt was a failure.Nell and Fen had intended to return to Australia, but Bankson convinces them to return to New Guinea with him. He helps them find a new tribe to study along the Sepik river. In return, Bankson hopes to find some research partners and break out of his debilitating isolation.The empathetic Nell falls in love with the gentle people of this tribe, the fictitious Tam.The combination of Stone, Fen, and Bankson does prove to be intellectually fertile. Together they develope some new approaches to anthropology.They also become a love triangle. Fen and Bankson have a love/hate relationship and Nell Stone falls in love with Andrew Bankson (not surprising considering the mess her marriage has become). Bankson is in fact much more compatible with Nell.In addition, it seems that Nell and Helen had a lesbian relationship, from which Fen had pried the reluctant Nell. Nell can't shake the memory of Helen.All of this is evidently based on fact. In real life, Mead did marry Bateson after breaking up with Reo Fortune. And apparently she did have a sexual relationship with Ruth Benedict. Anyway, to say anymore about the story would be giving spoilers. Let's just say that the story of the fictional characters plays out a bit differently than the story of the real anthropologists.The story is gripping, not just for the interplay among the characters and their interactions with the tribespeople but also for the light it sheds on the excitement and intellectual ferment of pioneers in any field. Also the novel shows the work methods of Nell Stone (Margaret Mead) and Bankson/Bateson. Fen/Reo Fortune comes across as less disciplined. Plus he deliberately withholds information from Nell. But, more than the other two, he wants to \"go native\". He wants to be a part of the tribe more than to study it.It's also interesting to see how Nell Stone genuinely cares about the Tam. It's not at all clear that Fen does, though.It's a terrific book.The audio is read by Simon Vance, who's pretty much the gold standard for audio readers, and does a fantastic job here voicing both the shy Brit Bankson and the strutting Aussie Fen. Nell Stone is read by Xe Sands, who is also excellent."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I had a review copy of this book for months last year and now I'm kicking myself for never getting into it. At the same time, it fits perfectly into my month of reading books from and about New Guinea, so the bookish universe must have known I needed to wait.I've read several novels about anthropologists - some I loved, like Mating by Norman Rush, and some I liked slightly less but still enjoyed, like State of Wonder by Ann Patchett.In Euphoria, Lily King takes the person of Margaret Mead and her first research in New Guinea and that becomes the basis of her novel (she doesn't say this within the novel but it is pretty obvious, and others have pointed it out as well.) I have a copy of Growing Up in New Guinea: A Comparative Study of Primitive Education coming my way, so I will have the experience of dipping into her actual writings. The field of anthropology was in its infancy in the 1930s, and that is well reflected in this novel. The characters question themselves and are questioned by the others in their lives.\"I asked her if she believed you could ever truly understand another culture. I told her the longer I stayed, the more asinine the attempt seemed, and that what I'd become more interested in is how we believed we could be objective in any way at all, we who each came in with our own personal definitions of kindness, strength, masculinity, femininity, God, civilization, right and wrong.\"Lily King also gets quite a bit of PNG culture right, and some of it she stretches in a pretty believable way. Especially in the 1930s, anthropologists had to take what they were given, and often got it wrong (or didn't get the whole picture.) What she gets more right is the isolation and difficulties of anthropologists in the field, and how they might relate to one another when they are so needful of contact. Although I'm not sure anyone, anyone could successfully transport two desks and a mattress that far up the Sepik River (small detail.)\"And now I am engulfed in this new flavor, so different from the light but humorless flavor of the Anapa and the thick bitter taste of the Mumbanyo, this rich deep resonant complex flavor that I am only getting my first sips of and yet how do I explain these differences to an average American who will take one look at the photographs and see black men & women with bones through their noses and lump them in a pile marked Savages?\"There is even an element of self-examination, why does the anthropologist do the work? What is he/she looking for? These are fictional anthropologists but I have often found this in the books I've read by journalists and researchers who travel deep into New Guinea. Michael Rockefeller, Carl Hoffman, Kira Salak so far. \"I think above all else it is freedom I search for in my work, in these far-flung places, to find a group of people who give each other the room to be in whatever way they need to be. And maybe I will never find it all in one culture but maybe I can find parts of it in several cultures, maybe I can piece it together like a mosaic and unveil it to the world. But the world is deaf.\"\"When only one person is the expert on a particular people, do we learn more about the people or the anthropologist?\"The intense focus on research is interesting, the relationship triangle is compelling, and the differences in tribes along one river is fascinating."}], "description": "Inspired by the true story of a woman who changed the way we understand our world.In 1933 three young, gifted anthropologists are thrown together in the jungle of New Guinea.
