Rae Carson, you are a genius. A genius among geniuses. If you only promise to write books that are this good in the future, I will raise a pedestal in your honor. No joke. The Bitter Kingdom is damn near perfect. Hell, it probably is perfect but since I'm too blinded by the perfection that is Hector, I'm unable to call anything else perfect in comparison to him. *swoons*Top 5 Reasons To Read The Bitter Kingdom. (In case you needed any convincing...which you HOPEFULLY don't because if you do, you are INSANE.) 1. HECTOR! As if there was a better reason to read this book. The Bitter Kingdom has a few glimpses into Hector's mind and what I loved about these were that they were short, concise, and yet carried so much weight in the story. The Bitter Kingdom is not a loud, in-your-face conclusion the way Clockwork Princess is. Quite thankfully, there is no endless drama and breaking of hearts and tears and useless epilogues. Instead, there is a slow, steady, and loyal burn of everything from trust to friendship to romance. The Bitter Kingdom is one of those conclusions to look back upon and smile; one that will induce a warmth throughout your whole body. It is simply so very sweet and true and the strength of the romance in this installment lies not with sexual tension (Carson teased us enough with CoE!), but rather with simple one-line statements that cause your stomach to flip and flutter. Furthermore, Carson doesn't try to additionally build the existing relationship between Hector and Elisa. Instead, what she does is portray them as equals and convey to us the strength of their bond. It's beautiful and will leave you grinning like a complete fan-girl or just sighing softly as you flip through these pages.2. Elisa. I just love this girl. From Book 1 to Book 2, we've seen her grow and change tremendously and it truly seems as if Elisa is at her peak by the end of Crown of Embers but Carson continues to push her, to test her, to see how far she can go and how strong she can become. And I love that. And, best of all, I love that she grows into her own in this novel without the guidance of the people she's always had. Without Hector, without Ximena, without Alejandro or her father or her sister, Elisa finds herself and becomes who she truly is, stripped away of all that. And it's more than a little marvelous to witness. 3. Storm! Honestly, the only other book I've read that features a close friendship between a man and a woman is Through the Ever Night. I absolutely loved the tight friendship between Aria and Roar in that book and I love the bond that forms between Storm and Elisa in this one. It's more subtle and Storm doesn't have the charismatic aura that Roar possesses, but I loved these two just the same, if not more. 4. Mara. Elisa and Mara truly grew to care for one another and become a support system for each other in Crown of Embers and while that continues, it also changes in this installment. One of the most egregious faults with this book probably lay in its subtlety of everything. From the romance to the friendships to growth, nothing is overly emphasized or stressed, rather being touched upon and intricately woven into the plot line. While this worked out perfectly for me, mostly because it felt so much more realistic and the development I wanted between the characters already had such a strong foundation, it might affect other readers a bit more. Doubtful, but it might. On the other hand, though, I truly appreciated the skill with which Carson wrote this piece. 5. THE MINES OF MORIA! YOU SHALL NOT PASS! Seriously, I'm not even kidding, there ARE mines in this book. Admittedly, when I first saw the mention of \"mines\" and \"snow\" and \"mountain\" all I could think about was Lord of the Rings and I was a little worried Carson would try to pull a Tolkien. But, thankfully, she doesn't and the adventure scenes in this are riveting, well-written, and covered with plot-twists. I love that The Bitter Kingdom finally reveals to us the extent of world-building in this realm, its past, its present, and tackles on so much more too. Very lightly, Carson touches upon more religious themes, but mostly she discusses different cultures, diplomacy, and co-existence. Like its predecessor, this novel contains a LOT of politics and political intrigue, full with Megan Whalen Turner-esque twists that will come barreling out of nowhere. And it is so, so good. If you haven't already figured out, The Bitter Kingdom is not only a must-read, it's a must-pre-order-now-and-make-a-pedestal-for-Rae-Carson-already read. In fact, if there are any qualms I have with this book, it is only that there wasn't nearly as much making-out between Hector and Elisa as I wanted. Granted, even if this whole book was just making-out between Hector and Elisa, it STILL wouldn't be enough, which just goes to show how unbelievably amazing this novel is. Rae Carson, you have my heart. Just don't go breaking it with your next series. Or making it weep for swoon-worthy guys like Hector. Honestly, my heart can only take so much \"When will my Prince Charming Hector come?\" longing."}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "This book, while technically perfect and a highly enjoyable read---fell a bit short of my expectations. I've enjoyed the other books in the series, but I don't know...I can't exactly pinpoint it, but this book just didn't leave me completely satisfied; it just feels like I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. I said it was technically perfect, and I meant it. The writing is great, the plot is quick-paced, and action-filled; character development was well-done. It does have its faults, but they are minor, and they did not bother me too much. It just lacked...something.Or maybe I'm just having an off-day.This is a continuation of a series, and you do need to read the previous books. There is a lot going on in this book, guys. I hate to use the clich\u00e9d phrase \"the action never stops,\" but in the case of this book, it really is true, and it is a lot of fun. Right off the bat, Elisa and company are on the run. There is no explanation of what was going on, we are immediately immersed in the midst of Elisa going in pursuit of the captured Hector. There is no slow moment; they cannot afford to lose any time at all. Back in their country, there might be an imminent civil war, and they are under danger from the Inviernos, so they have to rush rush rush; there is no time to waste.For a good 75% of the book, we are on the move, constantly traveling, through mountains and forests and bad weather, snowstorms, and---the mines of Moria!!!!! I giggled when we came across that scene, because it was so reminiscent of The Fellowship of the Rings, even if it's not that similar. Come on, traveling through terrible weather, and having no other choice but to take an alternate route through the possibly treacherous mines? Nevertheless, that was probably my favorite segment of the book...mostly because I keep drawing mental comparisons.New characters are introduced, but only a few, and they are all relevant. I really think the entire book was well-written, I was never bored, the party's actions and decisions are rational, the plot moved along at an easily comprehensible pace, and I really loved that the character all play a significant role in the events of the book. There are no extraneous characters here.I have one wee complaint about Elisa. In the previous books, she is plagued with self-doubt, and I loved watching her grow. I have always wished that Elisa would become a stronger character. Well, um, I have to kind of eat my words, here, because I felt that in this book, she is a little bit too strong, a little bit too perfect. It seems like such a stupid grievance, but while Elisa still has her moments of doubt, her moments of silliness, they are overcome almost immediately, as she grits her teeth and powers through it. The self-doubt is still there, but it is minute, because of her determination to just get through this. She becomes a little bit too much of a martyr, for my liking. And I KNOW, I KNOW that she has to make all these sacrifices because of who she is...I still kind of miss her weaknesses.What I do love about Elisa is---finally, her acceptance of her own body, her own beauty.\n\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Alodia says.I startle at the compliment. Then I smile. \u201cI\u2019m beautiful to the one person who matters.\u201dShe nods. \u201cHector\u2019s mouth will drop open when he sees you.\u201d\u201cI hope so. But I meant me. I\u2019m beautiful to me.\u201d\nThe other characters, Bel\u00e9n, Mara, Hector, Storm, all feature promimently in this book as Elisa continues her quest, and they are truly essential to the story. I would venture to say that Hector is the weakest character in terms of character development, and to me, he was altogether forgettable, at times. If not for his status as Elisa's love, I don't think I would remember Hector much at all within this book. I love Mara and Bel\u00e9n's growing relationship, although I did want to bonk Mara on the head sometimes, for all her stubbornness.Of all the characters, I think I fell a little bit in love with Storm in this book...he plays a major role in the events, and his loyalty and devotion (that never crosses the line into love, no love triangle here, not even a hint of it, HALLELUJAH) to Elisa, as well as his own character development made him the most attractive character to me. I do love my haughty, stoic characters, who nurture a warm interior, and Storm is the personification of that. He just needs a good cuddle, really!I could have done without the addition of Mula as a side character in the book. I seriously doubt Elisa and Mara's judgment when they decided to bring her on, and I still seriously doubt their judgment after finishing the book. Given their mission, bringing Mula with them was a decision that felt incredibly unwise. She turned out to be useful, but they didn't know that at the time. It was a decision made from the heart, not the head, and there were too many ways that this choice could have gone wrong and bite them in the ass. A child has no place on a mission of such importance, and could only have brought them down.\n\u201cAre you the commander?\u201d Mula asks, squatting down near his head. He manages a nod as his eyes are drifting closed. \u201cI\u2019m Mula, but that\u2019s just my name for now. Did you know that Elisa is the queen? She has a sparkle stone. She healed me because I\u2019m her best slave. Want to see my feet?\u201d\nI also found Mula incredibly annoying.I wanted less Mula, and more of another new character, Waterfall.The plot seems too much at times. There were so much going on in this book, that at times, some things felt really rushed. The last part of the book could easily be split into a book of its own; things were glossed over and events just resolved themselves too easily, for the sake of time and space constraints within in the last section of the book. I am glad that this series drew to a satisfying conclusion, but I can't help thinking this book would have been a lot better, split into two. For a book of this quality, I would not mind the wait."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3736122-katie", "userReview": "HECTOR!!!!Hector has quickly become one of my favorite YA book boys. I'm not even sure what's so swoony about him, besides the fact that he's marvelous. If you've read the books, you know. You just know. Once he shaved that moustache, it was one big swoonfest every time he stepped into the scene.I also really loved the new setting in this book! Girl of Fire and Thorns had a desert feel to it, and Crown of Embers had more of a tropical thing going on. But Bitter Kingdom is definitely set in a cold, snowy world that really sets this one apart from the other two. You could tell that Rae Carson really had a lot of fun with this setting, and I definitely loved it!STORM!!!I. Love. This. Character.I didn't really know what to feel for him in the beginning of Crown of Embers, but as the book went on, he really started growing on me. Then I looked up about 75% of the way through and realized that i absolutely loved him. He's even more fabulous in The Bitter Kingdom, with his brutal honesty and stoicism. After Hector and Elisa, he's my favorite character by far. Elisa can have Hector, but can I have Storm?Is that weird?I don't know.Whatever.He's awesome.#noshameELISA!Elisa is one of my absolute favorite heroines in YA. I've loved watching her grow and mature throughout the series, and I think she really stepped into her own in The Bitter Kingdom. She's developed so much from the self-loathing princess that we met in The Girl of Fire and Thorns. And I love that her inner change is mirrored with her outer change, the way her body transforms from something soft and unused to something hardened by trials--it's all so metaphorical, and I heart it.All the other characters are fantastic, as well. I loved our new addition of Mula, the slave girl. She cracked me up. And Bel\u00e9n and Mara were great too. (On a side note: I really like that Bel\u00e9n is given the chance to redeem himself, which totally surprised me. Rae Carson is a tricksy lady for sure, always getting the jump on me with the way she plots her stories...)And besides characters (which is definitely my favorite part of this series), I also really liked the plot of this book. I liked that we got to see Invierno, that the romance between Elisa and Hector finally surfaces for real, and that they travel underground via tunnels a la the Mines of Moria from The Lord of the Rings.Really, this book was just awesome. Here's looking at you, Rae Carson.You're awesome.But...but...now the series is over.How am I going to get my YA high fantasy fix anymore?! I guess I'll have to throw my net a little wider, read some Melina Marchetta and Cinda Williams Chima.But until then, I'll just be mourning the loss of one of my favorite fantasy series.Don't mind me, I'm just weeping."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68159473-jeff", "userReview": "you know what?I like Hector."}, {"userName": "Norah Una Sumner", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28782884-norah-una-sumner", "userReview": "\u201cYou look beautiful,\" Alodia says.

This series. Wow. There are few books that have left me waiting anxiously for what seems like a long time to not end in disappointment. I couldn't imagine, when I started this book, how it would all turn out. I speculated and dreamed up my own ending while waiting to get my hands on this and for once, the book was so much better than anything I could dream up on my own.Very rarely do books like these end in a way that I thought was just darn perfect. Usually there is something in the ending that leaves me unsatisfied, such as story lines left unfinished or forgotten as the author weaves the story to an ending any which way she can. I felt this was well planned, well written and superbly executed. We even get a bit more of the ending than normal. A lot is usually left to the imagination of the readers, and those who are like me who get frustrated and want to scream \"How does it really end?!\" get frustrated at the abrupt ending. Rae Carson has taken the time and effort to finish her story. Finish it she did and it was beautiful.Another thing to praise? Obviously, after reading this story, Rae Carson doesn't feel the need to draw things out as long as possible. There are several things in this book that I thought would span the book, or most of it, but it didn't. The pace is perfect and the story thrived because it wasn't polluted with story filler. I was kept on the edge of my seat with an amazing story and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out. This series belongs on the keeper shelf."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz", "userReview": "Usual heroine: \"You steal the man I love? Well, I'm going to cry in the corner for half a book, feel sorry for myself and then just do my best and try to get to you while being stupid once in a while to make the book exciting.\" Elisa: \"You steal the man I love? Ha! I will first get a backup plan for my kingdom and then follow you saving lives, yours included, being totally badass, relying on the intelligence of my beloved, and acting like a true warrior.\"Seriously though. When everything is taken from Elisa she simply decides to take this exact everything back and to take it one step further by securing the peace between the nations, creating alliances and saving lives. Oh, and becoming champion of course. There is no hesitation, no doubt in Elisa. This girl used her brain from the very first page of the entire series, but in the final book she becomes a true monarch. Determined, with an iron will, intelligent and wise. She stays unbowed without losing her humanity and her heart. Fortunately, she doesn't degrade to a weakling and doesn't give up. To her credit, she doesn't even think about it. I think we all noticed that in many actually most books the heroines still have some damsel-in-distress traits and very typical weaknesses. Think about it, how many books did you read where the heroine is not only a queen, has to fulfill a prophecy, is very far from being physically perfect and is presented strong-willed and assertive? I am sure, not many. Hector is proves that he is a real man in this book. He doesn't doubt Elisa, he is nobel and loyal as always, and he teaches a very important lesson to the reader- sometimes you have to let somebody save you. I loved him in this book. I don't want to ramble a lot, to be honest. Do you know the feeling when you could complain in a one-star review for ages, but don't want to write a lot in a five-star one? Yeah. Secondary characters were as deep and alive as the main characters, the plot was full of interesting twits and turns and didn't lack action. The setting was new and exciting, especially the mines. The plot development and the world itself was very original, it didn't remind me on any other series I've read, which I was thankful for. Definitely going to come back to this series more than once. I highly recommend it to all those who love fantasy and those who love strong protagonists and something new and refreshing!

I kneel to no one.\u201dFinal books are always the hardest for me to write about. It is the end, and I know that there wouldn't be any sequels and things will stay the way they ended. At some point I am relieved how everything ended but some resolutions left me disappointed.The plot. The crown of embers ended with Elisa and Co on the run. They must save Hector, find out the truth about Godstones, and then Elisa must again prove to be the ruler of her people and restore her rights as a queen. This part of the trilogy was action packed, without any stops to catch a breathe and think. I believe I have a few white hairs after finishing the book. But it was worth it. We finally have a map and now can see what is where and how to get there. The first part of the book was my favorite. When the characters traveled through abandoned mines, I've become claustrophobic. It was a scary place, really, and the creatures that roam the place... well, let's just say they are not pleasant. Brrrr. Also, we've got some answers but not all of them and some things are left unsaid.\u201cIt is human nature to concoct explanations to fill the great void of the unknown.\u201dI get that we can't have everything we want, but I hoped for more closure maybe? Things are kind of ended up abruptly for me and I was not prepared to say goodbye. The second book stays my favorite, this one is on the second place. The characters. Elisa was the strongest character in this book. She almost didn't doubt herself and proved to be a true queen. But I missed the weaker Elise, the one who endured and suffered and won hard. It made her more human to me, not regal but alive. I still am proud of her and her accomplishments, but somehow power made her less interesting character. Though, most moments with her were still amazing and Elise is still one of the best female characters in YA for me.It\u2019s possible I\u2019ve been through too much, lost too much. War damages different people in different ways; Hector taught me that. King Alejandro became spineless and incapable. His father before him was rash and unpredictable, if I\u2019m to believe court gossip. Perhaps this is my damage. Maybe I am numb to fear because I am broken.What I really loved about Elise, that she puts more trust in herself than in god now.The truth is, I\u2019m not sure if God looked out for us, or if we won the day ourselves. I\u2019m not sure of anything about him anymore.Peace is such hard work. Harder than war. It takes way more effort to forgive than to kill.Poor Elise, imagine to be on a run almost for a year (I am counting all three books in one); it can be very tiring, especially when you always have to worry if this is a day when doom will finally catch up with you.These are the kinds of decisions I hate. It seems my choices too often are reduced to a single question: How would I rather die? Starvation? Scorpion venom? Falling to my death?Yeah, hard choices.We have chapters from Hector's POV in this book and I liked being in his head. He was strong and wonderful and protective. His relationship with Elise is slow-burning and intense and sensual. I totally ship this couple\u201cBut I\u2019m powerless,\u201d I whisper.\u201cYes, powerless,\u201d he echoes. \u201cWhich is why I have no desire to do this.\u201d He kisses my forehead, letting his lips linger. \u201cWhich is why I can easily say no to this.\u201d He presses his lips to mine, teases them open, and kisses me long and deep. \u201cAnd why I am not utterly compelled to do this.\u201d He yanks my body against his, and his hand slips under the hem of my shirt. \u201cDo you see, Elisa?\u201d he says, his voice dark. \u201cHow little power you have over me?\u201dHe has not stopped grinning like a little boy about to open his Deliverance Day gifts. He leans closer until our lips are a finger\u2019s breadth apart. He brushes a strand of hair from my neck, and I shiver. \u201cIf we were alone right now,\u201d he says, \u201cI would . . .\u201d\u201cI would let you.\u201d\u201cI love you too,\u201d he whispers in my ear. \u201cWholly. Madly.\u201d\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d\u201cI suppose.\u201dBut. BUT. In the second half of the book Elise was way stronger than Hector. She and only she had to make hard decisions. Hector kind of dangled in the background, and I found that his personality dimmed, and there were other much more interesting characters like Storm. Oh Storm, you are my favorite. He's got a really good character development in this book. I have a serious crush on him. Storm seems so careless on the outside but he cares and oh, how deep he cares.Storm chuckles. \u201cQueen, chosen one, horse thief. Let it never be said that you are not accomplished.\u201dHe catches Mara and me staring and rubs his hair, frowning. \u201cIt will grow back,\u201d he assures us. \u201cBy the time we reach Invierne, it will be less shameful.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m relieved to hear that your vanity has weathered this egregious trial unscathed.\u201d\u201cThank y\u2014 Oh. Sarcasm again.\u201dI know, he is so self-assured sometimes, but I adore him.Storm leans toward her and says in a teaching voice, \u201cJoyans consider it is rude to express one\u2019s true opinion unless it is unequivocally flattering.\u201dHer brow furrows. \u201cThen how do they express anything at all?\u201dHaha, indeed, how!In the afternoon, Storm suggests we make snowshoes. We\u2019ve never heard of such a thing, and we ask him to demonstrate, but he scoffs, saying, \u201cI was a prince of the realm. I bought snowshoes\u2014I didn\u2019t make them.\u201d\u201cA deathstalker,\u201d Hector says. \u201cLarger relative of the common cave scorpion. They glow when frightened. Their sting is painful and mildly poisonous but not usually serious. The problem is when they swarm. Multiple stings can be lethal.\u201d\u201cUgh,\u201d I say.\u201cYes. I agree they are ugh,\u201d Storm says.Really, every moment in Storm's company is a pleasure. If I would compare him to other fictional princes I like, it would be Nikolai from Grisha trilogy. I want a separate spin-off from Storm's POV.I love the friendship between Storm and Elise. It started rocky but transformed into something really precious:My heart twists. Storm and I have gone from enemies, to uneasy allies, to grudging friends. I would never tell him so, but I am fond of him.Talking about the topic of friendship in this book, I'd say it has the best kind of friendship - the one that fought for through thorns with bloody fingernails: I look around at my companions. \u201cThis might be it. The gate of the enemy. None of you are required to accompany me. It\u2019s your choice.\u201dBel\u00e9n shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect plan.\u201d\u201cAs easy as falling in love,\u201d Mara adds.\u201cFoolproof,\u201d Hector agrees.I don\u2019t deserve such friends. I blink against the sting of threatening tears and say, \u201cAll you Joyans are filthy liars.\u201dFemale friendship is amazing. I have no words, I always wanted a sister and what Mara and Elise have is precious:There\u2019s a hole inside me that she fills, something I wouldn\u2019t get from being queen or winning a war or even being with Hector.\u201cYou\u2019re the sister I never had,\u201d she adds.\u201cAnd you\u2019re the sister I always wish I had.\u201dOverall.This book was great. Last books of the trilogies are not always fulfilling; often they are disappointing. Compared to them, The bitter kingdom is an amazing conclusion to an amazing series. But still, I can't shake the feeling that something is lost to me, something more; the ending did not make me as happy and filled with satisfaction as I'd like to be when finishing a series I really enjoyed. Maybe it's me and everything is alright with this book, I don't know... It is a highly recommended series from my side and one of the best fantasy YA I've read this year."}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24383684-deborah", "userReview": "This is the third and final book in this series and for me the best one so far.

Elisa has come so far from the shrinking violet we met in the first book, and it's awesome to see an overweight character a) get a happy and loving relationship with a guy who thinks she's perfect as she is, b) lose weight through running all over the continent as part of her story, but still talk about how her thighs rub together when she walks and how her arms are chubby and how her legs are now muscly but not skinny, and c) be totally fine with her body, just as it is. Like, in the first book? Elisa's all \"OMG, no wonder Alejandro doesn't want me, look how skinny his mistress is\". But by this book, she's all \"My body can do awesome things. Food is delicious. I'll never be thin, but I'm 100% okay with that\". Add in awesome secondary characters and the fact that Elisa's service to God isn't what she thinks it's going to be, and you've got yourself one hell of a finale. 15/2/20164.5 stars. There was a LITTLE too much running-all-over-the-map stuff in this one for me to give it a full five stars, but it still wrapped up the trilogy very nicely. Elisa comes into her own so well through the course of the series, and this shows just how far she's come. I love the romantic relationship that unfolds in the course of this story, I love that not everyone gets a happy ending, I love that it's such a Latin-American world.

It was with no small amount of trepidation that I picked up Bitter Kingdom into my shaking hands, afraid but eager to learn Elisa and Hector\u2019s fate. In Crown of Embers, we left Elisa and Hector in a dreadful situation, apart and with far too many obstacles between them, with little hope for the future they both deserved. With that, The Bitter Kingdom promised to be a journey like no other, emotional, intense and entirely satisfying. I dare not imagine the pressure Carson was feeling while writing this finale, but I applaud her for handling it splendidly. For the most part, Rae Carson gave her trilogy exactly the ending it deserved. We were allowed to witness our favorite characters grow, become even more independent, determined and fierce. We got to see them fight not only for the rights that were given to them by birth, but also for those they\u2019ve acquired through bravery and intelligent handling of every situation. In the end, we were given plenty of time to say goodbye with bittersweet smiles on our faces. But was it all enough? Yes\u2026 and no.There were, admittedly, times when I felt that pages/words could have been put to better use. Bitter Kingdom, while epic in so many ways, slowed down and almost dragged in places. The journey through the desert felt unnecessarily long and tedious, and the tunnels that came later gave me the exact same feeling. I wanted to be with these characters, but I wished they would take me somewhere else. What The Bitter Kingdom offered that wasn\u2019t there before were several chapters from Hector\u2019s point of view. Usually, introducing another POV so late in a trilogy can be a double-edged sword, but for obvious reasons (i.e. our never-ending love for him) Hector\u2019s was most welcome. I was afraid he\u2019d lose that slightly enigmatic air about him, but even with these glimpses into his thoughts, he remained as fascinating and desirable as ever\u2026 if not more.Along the way and perhaps despite the circumstances, Elisa became a force to be reckoned with. In The Bitter Kingdom, we find her ready to fulfill her role as the queen and bearer of the Godstone. That lost, silent girl we met in Girl of Fire and Thorns is long gone and in her place is a woman and a warrior, intelligent and fierce. Seeing her finally accept herself filled my heart with enormous pride and joy.While this trilogy isn\u2019t free of faults, it\u2019s still a wonderfully imaginative YA fantasy I\u2019ll never hesitate to recommend. I\u2019m also quite sure we\u2019ll see many more great books from Rae Carson and I\u2019m anxious to learn what comes next. \nA copy of this book was kindly provided by the publisher for review purposes.

But I meant me. I\u2019m beautiful to me.\u201d\nWhen I started Fire and Thorns I definitely did not expect it to become one of my favourite high fantasy series of all time, and yet here I am absolutely loving it. The first book was enjoyable enough, it was the second two instalments that made me fall in love with all the characters - especially the amazing development of Elisa, the different worlds its magic and believes, and of course the swoonworthy romance. Fire and Thorns was truly memorable fantasy series for me and I know this is not the last time I'll visit this world.\nWhat I loved:\n \n\u201cStorm chuckles. \u201cQueen, chosen one, horse thief. Let it never be said that you are not accomplished.\u201d\n* The main heroine Elisa - her believable character, her mistakes and the way she continued to improve and grow throughout this series. Her stunningly realistic character development was one of the best aspects of this series.\n\u201cI think sometimes when we find love we pretend it away, or ignore it, or tell ourselves we\u2019re imagining it. Because it is the most painful kind of hope there is.\u201d\n* the romance - I simply loved Hector. We even get to see a bit of his own chapters. And let me tel you, this was exactly how I've imagined his voice to be. His chapters were short, on point and greatly contributed to this last book. When I started this series, I definitely didn't expect to find one of my best book boyfriends there, and here I am, completely in love with Lord Commander of the Queen's Guard. It was such a slow burning romance, and I loved the ways Hector was supportive of Elisa and gave her confidence (especially in book two, in this one we see Elisa gaining confidence wholly of her own). Their relationship was based on friendship, trust and admiration and I loved that! It was a true partnership of two equals.\n\u201cPromise me you'll live,\" he insists. \"Because when this is all over, we must discuss how you sometimes kiss me to shut me up, and how I'll no longer stand for it.\u201d\n * We finally get to see even more of the fascinating world - and magic - Rae Carson created! I was especially excited about getting to see the frozen Invierne. I loved all the varied cultures Carson created, their different beliefs and histories. The hatred between the two cultures was based on distrust, grudges held too long, ignorance and lack of understanding of one another. The world - its struggles and magic - felt real.\n\u201cStorm leans towards her and says in a teaching voice, \"Joyans consider it is rude to express one's true opinion unless it is unequivocally flattering.\"Her brow furrows. \"Then how do the express anything at all?\u201d\n* Amazing side characters and friendships - I especially loved the friendship between Elisa and Storm. Here we have an amazing f/m friendship that is not in the least romanticized. How rare and precious in this genre! I also love the friendship between Elisa and Mara. And the sweet cinnamon rolls that were both Red and little prince Rosario.\n\u201cBel\u00e9n shrugs. \"It's a perfect plan.\"\"As easy as falling in love,\" Mara adds.\"Foolproof,\" Hector agrees.I don't deserve such friends. I blink against the sting of threatening tears and say, \"All you Joyans are filthy liars.\u201d \n\n\u201cWeren't you scared?\" I ask.\"Yes. But it was a good scared.\"\"There's a good kind?\"\"Oh, yes.\" Her voice drops so low I have to strain to hear. \"Orlin made me scared all the time. Scared I would starve. Scared I would get too cold. Scared he would hurt me again or get so mad he'd throw me to one of the men. That was nasty bad scared.\" She pauses, scuffing her boots against the floor. \"But you never hit me, even though I'm your slave... You always feed me. You call me my true name. Now when I'm scared, it's not because of meanness. And today, I chose my own scared. It's always a good scared, when you get to pick it your own self.\u201d \n- Red* All the positive messages behind this story.\n\u201cIt is human nature to concoct explanations to fill the great void of the unknown.\u201d\nAs for what I didn't like, I have no idea. I'm always trying to be objective, but in this case I completely loved it all. I had a few problems with the first book, but the next two completely swept me away. If you have read book one and liked it but are hesitant about picking up the sequels, I'd recommend for you to continue with this series. Loved it!\n\u201cPeace is such hard work. Harder than war.

Anyway, here we go!!This book was such a disappointment to me and I know what some might say and that many will be surprised but I honestly believe that The Crown of Embers was the best book in the whole trilogy. In the last book there were so many suspenseful momenta that had you biting your nails till the very end. There was action and love and just plain awesomeness from both Hector and Elisa and all the other characters like Mara, Belen and Storm (especially Storm cause he\u2019s awesome). Then in this book, though there is still action and love and lots of awesome characters, there was something lacking. Something that Crown of Embers had and this one did not.Hector has been taken and Elisa and the rest of the gang (minus Ximena) are out to save him. To do so they must go deep into the heart of the cold and bitter Invierne (hence the name The Bitter Kingdom). Then they must go back home and stop the general from taking over Joya d\u2019Arena and the Inviernos from taking over all the other territories. With that you think it will be the awesomest thing EVER! But it\u2019s not.It\u2019s great and the story is good and it\u2019s always good to see Hector (my book boyfriend) and Elisa at work together because they have such great chemistry and are awesome together and alone. We also get to see a lot more Storm, which is awesome because he is honest and loyal and even though he is an Invierno he is just as Joyan as the rest of the group. Then there is Mara and Belen, the best friend and the one eyed fighter/spy/awesome person. Now we also get a new character, Mula, who I can\u2019t say much about but the point is that everyone is back and everything is great but there was something off.I felt like a lot of time was wasted and Ms. Carson just wanted to fill up space and try to tie all the loose ends at the very end and I didn\u2019t like it. I felt like the end was rushed, like it all got resolved both too quickly and too conveniently. Also it wasn\u2019t action-y and suspenseful enough for the end of a trilogy. The Iron Queen is one of my favorite books EVER! I won\u2019t go too much into detail but in the end you could not stop reading because you knew that it would kill you if you did. There was action till the last page when you really just wanted to start crying because of what had happened. There was no happily ever after (not that I\u2019m against that) but the characters were always fighting and it wasn\u2019t a sit and talk and an easy way around it. In The Bitter Kingdom I felt it lacked that nail biting finish where you fear so badly for these characters and that action and suspense till the very end. To be honest I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m explaining this right or if any of you will understand what the heck I\u2019m saying but too bad, it\u2019s already been said.In the end, was the book awesome? NO, Crown of Embers was awesome. But, was the book good? YES, very good actually. I totally recommend it to all people with the ability to read (though you might want to start with the first book, The Girl of Fire and Thorns). There you have it folks, the somewhat epic and entirely good book to the Fire and Thorns trilogy! May there be many other books like this and its predecessor, Crown of Embers.

However, I was disappointed that the majority of The Bitter Kingdom was basically a long journey - I hate it when a story mainly consists of a journey, I don't find it imaginative or particularly entertaining.-One of the best aspects of the series was the character growth of the heroine, Elisa. She started off fat and useless and transformed into a confident leader. It was refreshing to read a YA heroine who was a positive role model, most YA books tend to have heroines who constantly whine and who only think about their love interest. Elisa cared about other people and things, her love life wasn't her main priority. I was kind of hoping that Elisa wouldn't end up quite so perfect, her growth was admirable but by the end she did come across as a bit of a Mary Sue. I was glad that she wasn't an intolerable sort of Mary Sue though, she still managed to be likeable. -I enjoyed the different friendships between Elisa, Belen, Storm and Mara - I prefer it when the heroine isn't a loner, and has important relationships outside of the hero. Heroines who have friends and family just come across as more layered and complex to me, whereas loner and orphan heroines who have no friends usually read as one dimensional to me.-I wasn't a fan of Alodia, the way she was with Elisa was awful \u2014 she treated Elisa like a child and never gave her a chance to grow. I wish Elisa hadn't been so forgiving and understanding about all the secrets Alodia kept.-I loved Elisa's and Hector's relationship, they had so much respect and love for each other. Most YA romances tend to be cliched or forced or even abusive. So it was nice reading a sweet, healthy relationship that made sense - Hector's POV only made their romance that much more swoony.-The worldbuilding and secondary characters were done well. But I wasn't impressed with the actual story, I liked how determined Elisa was to save Hector and her country but I wasn't impressed that most of the plot was just a long journey. I dislike books that consist of the protagonists traveling different places - I always feel like something's missing in stories like that.-I wasn't happy with not finding out the exact meaning behind Elisa's godstone destiny. Such a big deal was made out of her godstone, I would have liked its purpose to have been a key element in the resolution of the plot, the fact that it wasn't was a let down. The oasis was so random, what was so important about it? Why did Elisa need to discover the oasis? I'm kind of hoping there's a spin-off which explains the mystery behind it.-All in all, the Fire and Thorns trilogy wasn't the most exciting fantasy series but it was still entertaining, and was thankfully free from over the top teenage angst.**ARC from Edelweiss"}, {"userName": "Alaina Meserole", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina-meserole", "userReview": "This book was so good!I think this was my favorite out of the whole series - maybe.

I seriously loved Storm throughout this book too and I was just wanting him and Elisa to get together throughout the entire book - screw Hector! Ugh!

From it's rich lure of fantasy blend, and it's thickened plot, to it's breathtakingly hypnotic romance, and non-stop action and adventure, and magical background that solidifies this series to it's fullest. THE BITTER KINGDOM was one hell of a finale that I am utterly satisfied with, but drastically needing more...I am speechless after reading THE BITTER KINGDOM. I feel like my feelings are all jumbled and no words I can form will do it nearly any justice. There are no words to express the full depth and love I have for this book\u2014no series. This series is one of those series that will stay with me for a very long time. And I'm saddened to see it all end, as I still want more from these characters and this world. But either way I still really enjoyed the way this series ended, even though at the same time it felt incomplete. But it doesn't really matter because it was an EPIC journey though it all!!Like I said above, this book ended great, it was absolutely wonderful. But, I still did feel that their were still too many unanswered questions that were left open at the close of this series. And it kept picking at me long after this book was over. It felt like it wasn't the end of the series and that another book would follow. It just didn't wrap up as good as I hoped it would have. I would of liked to see how some of the side charters ended up after the battle was all said and done. I guess I just wanted more from the epilogue, and to see how things fared after the main plot was played out. BUT nevertheless, it still delivered in more ways then one, and has stole my heart and branded it's world forever in my soul.The writing was as elegant and suspenseful as ever, and the characters had so much growth and development that it was heart-warming to see the strength they were able to pull from each other through all their struggles. I loved watching them through each book as they went through and endured each obstacles that tested them to their fullest, and were able to find the strength and endurance at each turn to overcome their predicaments and become stronger and more determined then ever! THE PLOT  Elisa has failed her kingdom, and now she's paying the price for that failure... Betrayed by supposed allies in her most trusted circle, Elisa is now hunted, a wanted fugitive in her own kingdom. Hiding amongst her own people, trying to blend in and cope with the capture of the captain of her guard and the man she's slowly came to love. Elisa can't possibly imagine it getting anymore complicated, but boy is she wrong. It's about to become a sandstorm of madness... ELISA HAS 5 GOALS: 1-Free her beloved Hector before he makes to Invierne in enemy hands, and surfers a fate unimaginable. 2-Safely enter the City of Invierne and stop the impending war that's on their way to her kingdoms doorstep. 3-Meet with the neighboring kingdoms Queens, her sister Alodia, and her good friend Cosm\u00e9, to forge a health alliance and hopefully join their kingdoms. 4-Stop civil war from tearing her kingdom apart at the hands of the fellow Quorum Lord Eduardo, before it's to late. 5-And finally\u2015finally, restore her kingdom back to it's once glory, or better yet, make it even more remarkable then it ever was.Simple right? Ooh no, far from it!! Elisa's journey will be horrendous as it takes her all across neighboring kingdoms and back, fighting enemy's and supposed allies at every turn. But Elisa is steadfast on completing her 5 goals before all is lost to them all. She is their Queen, and their born savior, and she will not give up until all is saved, until her kingdom is back in good graces, no matter the sacrifices, she will endure them all...THE BITTER KINGDOM went above and beyond the limits I expected, and though it didn't end the way I thought, it still rocked this series to the very core and has me eagerly anticipating more from Rae Carson. Because this woman is brilliant, and truly has the special gift of creating magical worlds that not only draws the reader in, but also invest them into her world and wonderfully characters, that satisfies in more ways then one.Overall, THE BITTER KINGDOM is a thrilling conclusion that is not to be missed. This whole series is wonderful and will go down as one of my favorite series of all time!! If you're looking for an epic adventure though enemy lands, and a battle to save a kingdom with magical elements, and a bitter sweet romance, then THE BITTER KINGDOM and the complete series is definitely for you!!"}, {"userName": "Carol (StarAngel's Reviews) Allen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6294320-carol-starangel-s-reviews-allen", "userReview": "What a great series...I honestly didn't think I would this in the beginning but I was pleasantly surprised with how this series turned out!Even though it is tagged as YA ---- this book is great for all age groups!"}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19673751-elena", "userReview": "4.5Amazing conclusion to an amazing trilogy !

It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been so thoroughly enthralled with a series, and I\u2019m so happy I gave the Fire & Thorns books a try because this series is going down as one of my top 5 favorite trilogies. Everything about these books was pure perfection from start to finish. In fact, I thought these books only got better and better as the story progressed \u2013 how many series can you say that about? Rae Carson is undeniably a talented storyteller and I couldn\u2019t get enough of her writing.Here are the elements that stood out the most for me during this trilogy:ELISA: PROTAGONIST & QUEEN OF MY HEARTWhen it comes to books, I generally find myself gravitating more towards the male lead, mostly because I like swooning over them, but in this series, without any doubt, Elisa was the bright spot for me. I knew from the very beginning that she would be a character that I would love with all of my heart. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise when by the end of the trilogy, I had a mad girl crush on this girl. Her character development has got to be one of the best I\u2019ve ever read in a book. Rae Carson left no stone turned when it came to fleshing out her characters and showing the changes to their personalities as they went through hell and more. Elisa was an intelligent, but naive young woman with a quiet strength, who had been bestowed with a gift and a huge responsibility at the beginning of the series. Throughout the books, she slowly turned into a clever, wise, and badass queen, who you wouldn\u2019t want to mess around with. She grew to become so much stronger, resilient and comfortable in her own skin thanks in part to the heartbreaking, dangerous and scary obstacles that she was thrown into. What made Elisa such a brilliant protagonist for me was how real she came across through the narration. She was unconventional for a YA heroine with her dark skin, plain looks, heavier than normal body weight and her intense love affair with food. Her fears, insecurities and her desires were raw and made it easy to relate to her personality. Add to that her selflessness, bravery and independence, I was hopelessly in love with this girl.A MOTLEY CREW: LORD COMMANDER (HEART STEALER) HECTOR & A DIVERSE CASTHECTOR! HECTOR! HECTOR!I know I said I thought Elisa was the strongest part of the Fire & Thorn series, even more so than the male lead, but that doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t completely in love with him. Hector was one fine man. MY GOODNESS. It\u2019s like he came out nowhere and charmed the heck out of me. He didn\u2019t play that crucial of a role in the first book and if there were any hints as to him being the love interest in that first novel, I completely missed them. In book 2 though, Rae Carson started to really dig into the fiercely loyal, sweet, and fearless character that was Hector. And then in book 3, she goes around and SLAYS me with Hector\u2019s POV and I stood zero chance against his charm. If every YA love interest was like Hector, I would forever be a happy reader. The secondary cast, more prominently, Mara, Belen & Storm, were also brilliantly crafted. They accompanied Elisa through most of her journey during this trilogy, and along with her, they too grew into their skins, becoming progressively stronger and fiercer. I LOVED this cast so damn much and I don\u2019t know how Rae Carson was able to give each of them a story arc and make them so complex. I would have never gotten tired of them had this series been infinite.RELATIONSHIPS TO ENVY: FRIENDSHIP, ROMANCE & MOREI love reading about friendships in any book as many of you probably know, so I was thrilled beyond words at the intricate relationships that Elisa had throughout the Fire & Thorns trilogy. Her blossoming friendship with Mara, has to be one of my favorite literary female friendships. They were comfortable around each other and showed each other support and strength no matter what the situation they were in. One of my favorite scenes in this series was in The Crown of Embers when Mara and Elisa had an incredible conversation about sex and love. It was empowering and really depicted what female friendship should be like. Elisa also had great, but very complicated relationships with Belen and Storm. I adored the banter they all shared together, but more than that, what stood out to me was their devotion towards one and another and how well they worked as a team. I shipped all these friendships!The romance was just as brilliant as every other aspect of this series. It was very much a slow-burn romance, that remained in the background for the most part, but you guys, it was swoony, and made me ship the couple so hard. Elisa & Hector\u2019s romance didn\u2019t begin until The Crown of Embers and I\u2019m grateful for Rae Carson for allowing Elisa to mature into her strength before she began to fall in love. The relationship was so perfect, because it was based on friendship, trust and companionship. Hector considered Elisa an equal in every respect and he allowed her to be who she was and make her own decisions. They were a perfect team, complimentary in every way. And boy did Hector make me swoon with some of his lines. I loved this OTP!A MAGICAL STORY: RELIGION, WAR & HIGH STAKESRae Carson is highly skilled at the art of storytelling. Every plot turn, piece of world building and character is calculated and she never wasted her time with overwhelming info dumping in this trilogy. I sometimes struggle with world building in YA fantasy books, it\u2019s very easy for me to become lost and dazed, but here, it had an easy flow to it and it helped that she built it slowly and steadily. The fictional religion was a huge part of the Fire & Thorn books, and I loved the author\u2019s take of it and how she seamlessly incorporated it into the book. Impending war with neighboring nations, discrimination and prejudice were other pivotal parts of the series and with the inclusion of magic, it was portrayed tactfully and beautifully. The whole series had a very adventurous feel to it, with Elisa and her companions traveling long distances to reach neighboring nations, often times encountering enemies, human and natural, and the stakes were undeniably high. I was scared for the fate of the characters. I loved the addictive quality that the story possessed and I appreciated the fact that there was never a single dull moment throughout the series.In the end, the Fire & Thorn series is one I\u2019m going to cherish forever and no doubt one that I will come back to again and again in the future. Now that I\u2019m done with these books, my heart feels a little empty. I will miss the characters, especially Hector and Elisa dearly. Thrilling, character-driven and subtly swoony, this is a series I will never stop recommending."}], "description": "The champion must not waver.The champion must not fear.The gate of darkness closes.Elisa is a fugitive.Her enemies have stolen the man she loves, and they await her at the gate of darkness.
