It is the ultimate Lifetime movie-- the perennial dramathon we've come to expect from love stories. Gay Brokeback, not Peter Pan.Anyway, I also don't really regard the short story by Annie Proulx all that. So, then, which is the definitive gay love story of all time?NOT the Front Runner, that's fo show.It is melodrama supreme... the sentimentality like molasses, oozing its way into a reader whose intrigue is dimmed as the conclusion becomes all too apparent. It's sad, but not intimately sad. It's hot, but not ultimately hot.For a fairly better delving into modern gay lit, go with Ben Saenz's \"Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe.\" And if you want the ultimate experience in CLASSY gay stuff, Alan Hollinghurst is your man. Or Isherwood. Heck, even Armistead Maupin has his moments with the muse.Not this one, though.

It was written by a woman, which I find intriguing, and involves a relationship between a college track coach and one of his students separated in age by a considerable gap.The story has quite a few issues for me - mainly the development of a relationship between the two main characters - it is clear that Harlan is attracted to Billy - with no development. Their relationship just suddenly ferments and develops into fruition. There are quite a few stereotypes presented in the book and the laydown of Harlan at the very start of their relastionship - marriage or its over - seemed a bit off.For all the book's faults, I enjoyed reading it and will read it again in the future. I felt for Harlan and the many struggles he underwent, could relate, and rooted for him from the beginning. The standout quality aside from the characters relationship and development was the idea that \"liberalism\" was simply the idea of \"acceptance\" in which people are judged on their personality and not on physical appearance while acknowledging people's freedom to make their own choices. As Harlan progresses from conservative to \"liberal\", nothing is mentioned about social programs or the other crazy stuff that, in today's society, makes one a liberal. A liberal then was simply someone who acknowledged everyone as a human being and didn't discriminate or hold prejudice - a concept I can get behind.The book is full of some very memorable and interesting quotes that made me chuckle:\"Macho gays, all of them. I should have recognized those leather pants of Billy's.\"\"'I'm not one of your mealy-mouthed permissive liberals.'\"\"The gay who is a good dancer can turn even the fox trot into an uninhibited celebration of male sexuality.\" *i like to think so also :)A few sentences later...\"All the action was in the hip-jerking, the crotch-gyrating, the buttock-twitching and the thigh-weaving.\"sort of spoiler....don't read...unless you want a hint.\"How many more times would I have embraced him that night, how many more times would I have kissed him, if I had known the name of that stranger lover who was already in Montreal, who had already bought his stadium ticket from a scalper for the 5,000 tomorrow.That implacable lover who was going to turn Billy's eyes away from me forever.\""}, {"userName": "Lena\u2665Ribka", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10446876-lena-ribka", "userReview": "I love it soo sooo much!

That's all I'll say about how it was that I ended up blubbering in the midst of the Atlanta airport last week on my way to New Orleans.This book was phenomenal. That it has just had its 20th anniversary makes it all the more stunning to me for its ability to hold up over time, as so many books struggle to do. Set in the year leading up to the Montreal Olympics, we follow the life of an ex-marine Coach who begins very much in the closet, and who falls in love with a gay runner left in his charge.Warren's characterizations are fantastic - you can feel these people, their emotionality has an absolutely realistic pulse, and the love story at the core of the novel left me aching. The historical content was spot-on; her treatment of what gays and lesbians of the period went through was frighteningly accurate, and at the same time quite a positive reinforcement of many the things we have accomplished. This book is a glimpse at the social rights movement that brought us this far, as well as the lives of two gay men written so well that you really will breathe with them.But, like I said, perhaps not something to read on vacation in an airport.

Yo a Harlan le perdonaba todo menos su relaci\u00f3n con los hijos, no los nombra nunca y cuando lo hace es solo por la plata. Jam\u00e1s se le pasa por la cabeza averiguar c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n o tratar de tener una relaci\u00f3n con ellos. Entiendo que hay personas que simplemente no tienen madera de padres.Pero M\u00cdNIMO esperaba que tuviera alg\u00fan pensamiento para con ellos pero, no es como si nisiquera hubiera tenido hijos. No nombra ni una puta vez, le importan una mierda, y \u00a1ENCIMA ME TENGO QUE BANCAR QUE SE PONGA A HABLAR CON BILLY SOBRE TENER UN HIJO JUNTOS!. Hombre. \u00a1tuviste dos hijos y te lavaste bien las manos! y ahora queres tener otro y encima lo que me sac\u00f3 mal fue que Harlan dec\u00eda \u201cque lo mejor de haber estado casado fueron los hijos y que los chicos a veces eran insoportables pero le encantaba cuando \u00e9l llegaba a la casa y ellos de dec\u00edan papi, papi\u201d (algo as\u00ed) si, \u00a1se re nota como amas a tus hijos porque hablas de ellos todo el tiempo!. Deja de hacerte el padre fatal y ENCIMA despu\u00e9s es esa parte que recibe una carta del hijo mayor (resulta que se llama Kevin, la segunda vez que lo habr\u00e1 nombrado en todo el puto libro) y me pareci\u00f3 un recurso bajo para que pensemos \u201cay, lo hijos de Harlan son TAN malos\u201d y nos olvidemos que el tipo este es un padre de mierda. No est\u00e1 bien ser homof\u00f3bico pero teniendo en cuenta la inexistente relaci\u00f3n que ten\u00eda con los hijos era obvio que algo de bronca le iban a tener. No te vengas a hacer el sorprendido, adem\u00e1s ni conocemos ni a los hijos ni a la esposa y ya los tenemos que odiar \u00bfC\u00f3mo los voy a odiar si adem\u00e1s de una o dos l\u00edneas ni aparecen?. Ni siquiera cuando viv\u00eda con ellos les daba bola, no se toma ni dos p\u00e1rrafos para describir su vida de casado m\u00e1s all\u00e1 que para hablar de \u201c\u00e9l, \u00e9l, \u00e9l\u201d y como re cagaba a la mujer. Harlan se hace odiar y amar f\u00e1cilmente. Al principio lo odi\u00e9, despu\u00e9s me empez\u00f3 a gustar pero con lo que nombre antes el poco respeto/cari\u00f1o que le ten\u00eda se fue a la mierda. La relaci\u00f3n con Billy me gust\u00f3, fue hermosa hasta la p\u00e1gina 130 porque despu\u00e9s ya me empezaron a cansar, todo el libro se me volvi\u00f3 aburrido porque era leer lo mismo una, y otra, y otra vez. \u00bfAdem\u00e1s soy yo o Harlan es misogino?

Death, that hustler, that last lover.\u201dPublished between the era of Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best, and the AIDS crisis, The Front Runner is a very blunt and honest look at homosexuality in the world of American sports, circa 1975. By its time\u2019s standards \u2014 as well as the current day \u2014 this book is progressive; the ideas are daring, the revelations unflinching. The front cover calls it \u201ccontroversial\u201d and \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201cas moving as any love story ever written.\u201d I would agree with all those descriptors. What is this novel? It is a tragedy.The first person narrator is a college track coach quickly entering middle age. In the fall of \u201874 he received three candidates for his team \u2014 three boys kicked out of their previous school for their homosexuality. He, the coach, being gay himself, takes them under his wing; a romantic relationship between he and one of the boys soon develops. This book is almost certain to make any reader a little uncomfortable; good literature does that. This challenges every societal norm of its time and even some that are still in place today. While a bit excessively dated at times (some of the male characters are a bit too chauvinistic for my tastes), this story can be enjoyed by modern audiences. The pacing, too, is an issue \u2014 the middle is a bit of a slog, at times \u2014 but the noteworthy beginning and extraordinarily written finale more than make up for it.

It\u2019s set in the 1970s when I was a young mum with two toddlers, and in some ways the world has changed a great deal, but sadly, not enough. The narrator is Harlan Brown, the trainer of several Olympic hopeful runners at a small college near New York. One of them, Billy Sive, is a strong runner but on the wrong training regime. Harlan himself and three of his best runners are gay. So what, one might say these days? Although those of us who were young back then felt we were liberal, the Olympic committees and national games coaches were of a previous generation and were determined to prevent these boys from running for their country. Their prejudice now seems ridiculous but unfortunately there are places, in countries which call themselves civilised, where this is still the current feeling. The story of the love between the coach and the runner unfolds gradually. Each feels it mustn\u2019t be acknowledged and they fight their own instincts. It\u2019s beautifully told and very affecting. Their battle against officialdom is helped by Billy\u2019s father who\u2019s a human rights lawyer and this book is very much about equality and human rights. It would be wrong to give away too much of the plot but I will say that I was fascinated by the details of long-distance runner training and I loved the way the officials were offended that this gay man could be better disciplined, stronger, more masculine and have greater endurance than other, straight runners. It was their refusal to treat people as individuals which was so ridiculous yet so shocking.Looking back, I feel if I\u2019d read it when it was newly published it would have blown me away. As it is, it\u2019s a bit of history, albeit fictional.

The fact that it was written during the seventies has no bearing on how well written or marvelous it really is.It is told in first person by Harlen a track coach at a small college, who is gay. He suddenly finds himself with three track stars from another larger college who were thrown off their team for being gay.He comes to know and fall in love for the first time with Billy Sive, whom he coaching for the Olympics. None of the above described the book itself. As someone who has never has any interest in sports much less running. I found myself pulled into the runner mind, how they push their bodies to the limit for that extra second of time off their records. The complete love and devotion to their sport is in every page. The sexual aspects of the book are not lurid, and are almost completely off screen. I have a warning though. You will love every character in this book and by the end you will sob.

All of the gay characters in the story spoke as if they were a separate entity, a powerful 'us against the rest of the world' theme, and we other mere mortals on the planet were barely tolerated; although having said that, I can understand that the way they viewed other people was the same way they felt everyone viewed them....with disdain and gross intolerance. No doubt if I was American and had been around at the time, I would hopefully have felt more connected....but somehow, I don't think so. The writing certainly didn't impress, I thought it was poor and the story hasn't aged well, it seemed quite dated...which I suppose it is, it \nis\n 40 years old after all but I found What Binds Us to be a much better story all around, set around the same vintage with more humane and likeable characters. 3.5 stars from me."}, {"userName": "KatieMc", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8316749-katiemc", "userReview": "How perfect was starting this right as the start of the summer Olympics? I truly enjoyed this and am thankful that I can always rely on Lena, my trusty source for gay fiction recommendations. It's impossible to not to think of this as historical fiction, but this was written 40+ years ago when what feels like history now was a genuine struggle for anyone who dared to be out and gay. In other words, it's a contemporary love story written a long time ago. So after your done cringing at the horrible treatment these men endured, imagine the impact of reading 40 years ago a genuine love story between two men who are portrayed as human. Like any humans, Harlan and Billy were not perfect, but they were not horrible, freaks or perverts who threaten civilization. Those who read this 40 years ago got the simple message that love between two men is simply that. That is the importance of this book. So while it's not a literary masterpiece, it does have an important corner in the the world of gay fiction.About the running. I have been an avid runner for 35 years. I'm not competitive and I'm slow, but I am fucking consistent and I understand endorphins. I loved the running, training and competition the as a backdrop to this story. Extra star for the running."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/919360-beth", "userReview": "I definitely understand why The Front Runner is considered a classic of gay literature. The plot and characters were compelling and the social issues felt real. Needless to say, I think every reader is (or should be, at least) a little bit in love with Billy Sive. The narrator, on the other hand, was less than admirable, but he did improve over the course of the book.As a feminist, it bugged me to see how chauvinistic gay male culture of the 70s was. Although that is something I knew before from various other books, the sexism seems especially vile in this story.I don't want to say much else for fear of giving away the explosive ending, but I will give a piece of advice -- do NOT flip to the last page of the book. There is an ad for the sequel that gives away the plot of this novel and I happened to see it when I was about halfway through, thereby spoiling the ending. It speaks to the appeal of TFR that I continued to read, wanting to see how the ending unfolded.I am going to read the sequel, but I can't imagine that it will be as good as this story. Billy Sive really is an exceptional and beautiful character."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Treadway", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3226859-jonathan-treadway", "userReview": "I'd heard that this was another gay classic love story, like The Charioteer. Everyone's right! I can't believe I waited this long to read it, but I was absorbed immediately and caught up in the drama. Some of it seemed a little too good to be true, but all in all it was an excellent story. The romance between the two men is believable and heartwarming. Yes, I cried at the ending of this one too...but I bet everyone does! This is definitely a keeper, and one I will reread over and over."}], "description": "First published in 1974, The Front Runner raced to international acclaim - the first novel about gay love to become popular with mainstream. In 1975, coach Harlan Brown is hiding from his past at an obscure New York college, after he was fired from Penn State University on suspicion of being gay. A tough, lonely ex-Marine of 39, Harlan has never allowed himself to love another man. Then Billy Sive, a brilliant young runner, shows up on his doorstep. He and his two comrades, Vince Matti and Jacques LaFont, were just thrown off a major team for admitting they are gay. Harlan knows that, with proper training, Billy could go to the '76 Olympics in Montreal. He agrees to coach the three boys under strict conditions that thwart Billy's growing attraction for his mature but compelling mentor. The lean, graceful frontrunner with gold-rim glasses sees directly into Harlan's heart. Billy's gentle and open acceptance of his sexuality makes Harlan afraid to confront either the pain of his past, or the challenges which lay in wait if their intimacy is exposed. But when Coach Brown finds himself falling in love with his most gifted athlete, he must combat his true feelings for Billy or risk the outrage of the entire sports world - and their only chance at Olympic gold.", "title": "The Front Runner\n      \n          (Harlan's Story #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/343738.The_Front_Runner", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327890266l/343738.jpg", "reviews": 285, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/150238.Patricia_Nell_Warren", "name": "Patricia Nell Warren"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Lgbt", "Romance", "Glbt", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/343738.The_Front_Runner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/343739.El_corredor_de_fondo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2283961.The_Front_Runner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19283049-o-corredor-de-fundo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36099443-la-corsa-di-billy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/598039.The_Front_Runner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2345678.The_Front_Runner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/665461.Harlan_s_Race", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/665462.The_Fancy_Dancer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/665460.Billy_s_Boy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256973.The_Wild_Man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/283324.The_Beauty_Queen"]}
