I literally picked this book off the shelf at my library and figured I would give it a go. The beginning was a bit slow for me but soon picked up as soon as Mallory went to her hometown. This book was fun! Murder, money, beaches, unknown family life, a crazy adoption... All of it added up to make a great book. I am excited to read more of Coble's books. They're a nice cup of warm cocoa to read.

I\u2019m not sure what was different for me in regards to the action, but the story seemed to start off with a bang, and then slowed down. Perhaps this isn\u2019t really a critique of this book, but rather a testament to how much I did like the first book in the series and found the mystery to be utterly enthralling. The mystery here is still good, but not quite as layered and dynamic as the previous book and not quite as suspenseful. There were a couple of times that I think the plot suffered from repeating issues in the romantic relationship. Despite the issues I had with the story, I connected to these characters with ease and fully enjoyed the Maine setting that Colleen brings to life. Kevin\u2019s character really held my respect as he raised his child as a single parent and worked as a Game Warden. He is an all-around a likable character and easy to respect. Mallory returns home with a lot of personal baggage and especially between her and Kevin. I really liked that their story is one of second chances and letting go of past mistakes. It was refreshing to see Mallory come to the realization that she was the one holding herself back from true forgiveness, not the one\u2019s she assumed she\u2019d hurt years ago.This could be read as a stand-alone, but I love how layered the character\u2019s stories are overall when they return from previous books, so I recommend starting with The Inn at Ocean\u2019s Edge. Colleen excels at catching readers up with characters from the first book and giving us glimpses of those in an upcoming story. I am really looking forward to the third book about Kate, as she really tugged my heart strings in both books one and two, and I just know her story will be riveting and full of depth. Fans of Colleen\u2019s previous novels and those looking for a quality romantic suspense story are certain to enjoy Mermaid Moon."}, {"userName": "Linda Strong", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13684015-linda-strong", "userReview": "Mallory Davis hasn't been home in 15 years. But the phone call she receives from her father ... his last words ever spoken ... were Find ..Mother. But her mother died 15 years ago.Even though law enforcement is calling her father's death on his boat an accident, she believes that he was murdered. The man she nearly married all those years ago, Kevin O'Connor, now a game warden, happens to agree with her.A series of strange events puts everyone on edge. Her house is broken into ... her father's house was burned to the ground ....she and her teenage daughter receive death threats.As she and Kevin investigate, they start connecting the dots, but the closer they get to the truth, the more nervous someone gets, and the death threats get much more serious.Kevin wants nothing more than to protect Mallory and her daughter, but he's leery of getting too close. He was burned once and doesn't want to go down that road again ....but sometimes the heart is at odds with what the head thinks.There are numerous characters that muddy the waters. People are not always who they seem to be. Kevin's ex-wife and her lawyer husband make an appearance. Mallory's birth father is found a day or two before he dies. It is discovered that her adoptive mother didn't just die in a boat accident ... she was shot and killed. No one has been able to find her birth mother. As well as trying to find her father's killer, Mallory is also trying to find herself .. trying to forgive herself for all that went on 15 years earlier. This is a typical Romantic Suspense, but it is well-written. Mallory and Kevin are likable characters. The story line is okay, even if somewhat predictable.

I really liked Mallory as a character, and it was fun to have so much of Claire, Luke, and Kate from book 1. (I'd recommend reading this series in order, as this book has a few major spoilers for the previous book, and some character relationships/history makes more sense through that book.) It was truly interesting to have a game warden hero; I haven't seen that used much in mysteries, and it was neat to see him work on the case with the help of the local sheriff and his Coastie friend Luke.The romance is tasteful and believable; I'm a sucker for second-chance love stories like theirs.Some fun appearances: I absolutely love it when authors borrow each other's characters!

But I was offered it to review so I figured I'd give it a try and boy am I glad I did! This book was SO good, the suspense was absolutely non-stop and I had no idea who the villains were or what their motivation was, with as many romantic suspense book as I read it's hard to keep me guessing but Ms. Coble did it with this one, kudos to her! Where do I even begin to start describing all the things I loved about this book?! I loved the setting, the small ocean side town on the coast of Maine was beautifully written, I found myself feeling that I was really there and I loved how Ms. Coble was able to describe it so perfectly and still have time for all the crazy suspense. I loved both the main characters, Mallory and Kevin, they made such a great couple, it was great that even though there was pain they had to get past, they had been in a relationship years earlier so the romance never felt rushed in the slightest. I also loved Kevin's daughter Sadie, she was such a delightful ray of sunshine, I loved how she didn't let the difficulties she was facing get her down, I was greatly inspired by her.If you are a fan of Denise Hunter's books you will be just as thrilled as I was to know that her character Abby McKinley as well as Sheriff Danny Colton and the Town of Summer Harbor, Maine make cameo appearances in this book and likewise if you are a fan of Carrie Stuart Parks' books you will be delighted to see her main character Gwen Marcey make a cameo in this book as well. I loved that Colleen Coble brought those characters into this story, as a fan of both of those authors I thought it was simply the coolest! Oh, and even though Mermaid Moon is the second book in the Sunset Cove series they can be read as standalones, I have not read the first book and that did not affect my understanding or enjoyment of this story at all. I look forward to reading book one in the series as well as more of Ms. Coble's work in the future!Overall, I adored Mermaid Moon from start to finish, my only complaint is that by the end I was really mad...because the last thing I needed was to add another name to my overflowing list of favorite romantic suspense authors! LOL! :)But nevertheless I am delighted to say that after reading this book Colleen Coble now has a permanent spot on my list of favorite authors!

Colleen Coble is one of my go-to romantic suspense authors for a reason! Between Mermaid Moon and The Inn at Ocean\u2019s Edge (the first book in the Sunset Cove series), I have been spellbound for the past two days & on the edge of my seat from the suspense! (How many more exclamation points can I use in this paragraph?!?)The action started almost immediately and barely allowed me to catch my breath until the end. A doozy of a plot twist (or two\u2026 or three) kept me guessing in Mermaid Moon even more than in Ocean\u2019s Edge, and I could not put it down. Even when the suspense part of things calmed for a moment or two, the kisses (one in particular) stole my breath all over again \u2026 so it might be wise for you to make sure you have an alternate supply of oxygen close at hand before you begin reading :)I also loved the underlying theme of grace that permeates the story. Many characters in Mermaid Moon are in need of a second chance. Several have been given that fresh start yet still struggle to extend that same grace to themselves. Sometimes we are our own worst enemies, our own stumbling blocks, and Colleen Coble has painted a tender picture of the need to forgive ourselves as well as others.Bottom Line: Carve out plenty of time to read Mermaid Moon (and The Inn at Ocean\u2019s Edge if you haven\u2019t already) because you won\u2019t want to put it down once you start! Riveting suspense, rekindled romance, and gentle nudges of grace all merge together, grabbing your attention from the beginning and holding it captive until the very end. You don\u2019t have to have read The Inn at Ocean\u2019s Edge to follow what\u2019s happening in Mermaid Moon, but \u2013 if you have \u2013 you will enjoy seeing several familiar faces and continued story arcs.

None of the characters captured my interest and the plot fell flat. Although I usually like second chance romances, these two felt very juvenile in their back and forth emotions. Keeping their history and the reason for their breakup a secret from the reader lasted way too long and I wasn't really sure why it needed to be so slowly revealed. It detracted from the actual suspense plot which never reached it's potential. I guessed most of the \"bad guys\" and the reasoning. The ending somehow felt rushed and I finished feeling dissatisfied."}, {"userName": "Abra", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25610926-abra", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book at RT16.Reading through Mermaid Moon I was deciding between three and four stars, but then I got to the end and it became a two star book.The heroine, Mallory, gets a call from her father as he's dying on his boat. She calls her ex-fianc\u00e9, who is the local game warden and the first line of the law, and asks him to check up on her father. Kevin does and calls the sheriff. The sheriff thinks it's a accident, but Kevin doesn't. It looks like the boat has been searched and Kevin thinks he smells perfume. Mallory, her daughter, and her friend Carol drive to Mallory's father's house. The first night they're there someone throws a rock with a threatening note through the window and Mallory calls Kevin to report it. He comes over and they find that someone has broken in and stolen Mallory's old report cards, birth certificate, some picture albums, the love letters from Kevin, and some old journals. Mallory and Kevin's shared history is making it difficult for them to spend so much time together, but they make the effort to be adults. Kevin is still bitter about what happened and Mallory feels intense shame and guilt. Don't worry, there is no cheating.I liked the two main characters. The transition from \"stay away from me\" to \"I'll love you forever\" seemed kind of abrupt, but that's pretty much the standard in second chance stories. Kevin is a strong character and has a life beyond his feelings for Mallory. He's been married, has a real job, and has a blind daughter who came off as her own character rather than a plot moppet. Mallory's history since Kevin is a little stereotypical in that she married, but never really loved her husband because she always loved Kevin. She is the typical isolated heroine who only has the hero to depend on. Both her parents are dead as is her husband. Her only relative is an aunt who is elderly and lives a distance away. What does Mallory actually do for a living? Does she sell jewelry piece by piece to pay her mortgage? That seems a little iffy given the first chapter. She also has a daughter. I liked that Haylie was written like a real teenager, but no one judged her or Mallory for Haylie being somewhat self centered and annoying. I thought the balance between plot and romance was very well done right up until the end. First off, the ending didn't make sense based on information we were given earlier in the book. There is information that was common knowledge that completely removes the baddies' motivation for their actions. Even worse is that once the baddies are foiled and the HEA achieved, the book just stops. It's like it was only about the romance and the whole rest of what was going on was incidental. If what the baddies were worried about could happen, did it now they are out of the picture? Did Mallory rebuild? What did Haylie think about the HEA? What happened to the baddies?All this is a shame because Mermaid Moon is well written and I loved the setting in Maine. I got a strong sense of place and I really enjoyed that. The whole mermaid moon idea is beautiful and I loved the visual of Mallory and her mother looking for mermaids.While this is book two, I had no problem reading it as a stand alone."}, {"userName": "Kelly Bridgewater", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33835690-kelly-bridgewater", "userReview": "I have read a good bunch of Colleen Coble\u2019s writing, so I know what to expect when I approach any of her romantic suspense. For the most part, I truly enjoy her unique stories with their unique settings. Not one of her series really ever takes place in the same town, which I truly enjoy. As for Coble\u2019s second installment in her A Sunset Cove Novel series with Mermaid Moon, I enjoyed the mystery.I enjoy stories in series that bring back characters that I have come to know and enjoy spending time with in earlier books. In the first book in this series, The Inn at Ocean\u2019s Edge, I got to understand and empathize with Claire. She comes back in this second book and is a friend of our newest heroine Mallory. A great way for a writer to keep my attention is to bring back familiar characters and have them interact with the new characters.As for the conflict and romance, it wasn\u2019t such a high demand for suspense or mystery. The romance plays a huge part of the story with a little bit of suspense thrown in to keep the reader\u2019s guessing. Following the normal protocol for a romance book, I was pretty sure that Mallory and Kevin would overcome the struggles that kept them apart and find a way to move onto their future together. Totally predictable. On the other hand, the suspense part got vamped up in the last fifty pages of the book and kept me turning the pages, wanting to understand the reasoning behind the bad person\u2019s actions. Totally a unique idea. Really liked it.As for the writing, Coble does an excellent job at describing and inviting her readers into the setting with her use of imagery and descriptive words. I really felt like I have gone back and visited a favorite family vacation spot that I can\u2019t wait to return to every summer. The even amount of prose and dialogue keeps the story moving at a quick pace, allowing me to flip through the story pretty rapidly. I really had a hard time putting down the book.True to a romance novel, Colleen Coble latest mystery, Mermaid Moon, kept my attention as the sparks and danger flew across the pages, inviting me to return once more to Sunset Cove.

I have not read the first two books previous to this one, so I may be missing some of the background from the former books. I felt that I was missing information regarding a couple of the characters. Otherwise, the book is fast paced with suspense that will keep you from putting the book down. Romance comes into the picture as a past relationship is once again kindled. This was developed in a very natural progression and realism. There are dysfunctional relationships which cause a great deal of discomfort and confusion for the characters, but the author provides good background information regarding those issues. I would have liked more descriptive elements regarding the setting along the coast of Maine, but once again, that may have been provided in the first two books in the series. I would recommend reading this series in order rather than stand alone novels. I enjoyed Mermaid Moon and the elements that the title represents. This is a great read for a summer day on the beach, or while on vacation."}, {"userName": "Ibjoy1953 Hannabass", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5101390-ibjoy1953-hannabass", "userReview": "MY THOUGHTS ON THIS BOOK Wow!

A trip back into her past, including childhood sweetheart Kevin O\u2019Connor takes Mallory on a whirlwind trip that has Mallory digging into parts of her past, someone starts threatening Mallory, as well as her daughter\u2019s life.There is so much going on in this story, so many twists and turns. When I thought I had it all figured out, something else happens to throw me off again, and I loved it! Colleen Coble does such a fantastic job of creating characters that I connected with as they became part of the story, and realistic scenes that makes me wish I had been a detective! I love Ms. Coble\u2019s books, and this is one of her very best!

When you pick up and read a Colleen Coble novel you come to expect that it will be suspenseful and full of twists and this book did not disappoint. The book caught my interest from the first few pages when Mallory's father is found murdered on his boat. Mallory returns to the town and immediately her life and those she loves is in danger. She reconnects with a Kevin, a former boyfriend from her past. They have a painful history that they have to work through. He helps her in her quest to find out the truth and in the meantime old hurts are healed. I loved that part of the story and how it unfolded.The theme of this book is second chances. I loved how Mallory and Kevin were able to work out their problem and got the opportunity for a second chance. There is some other characters who had second chances but to mention them would be giving away too much of the story line.I loved the suspense and mystery in the story. I did not know who to suspect was behind all this until near the end. Sometimes you suspect one person and it turns out not to be the case. I like it when the author writes the story so well that you don't know who to suspect.Thanks to Netgalley and Thomas Nelson for providing me a copy of the novel to preview.

Oxygen mask required for this breathtaking read! Suspense on top of suspense and the romance...five star swoonworthy! This author never disappoints, but she outdid herself with Mermaid Moon. So -- the mystery -- incredibly intriguing. Coble kept me riveted trying to follow all the clues. Love the clever way she lines the story with subtle hints that gradually come together as the tale progresses. I created one hypothesis after another in my armchair sleuthing attempts to figure everything out. I was successful in some cases but the author totally blew me away in others. Like I said, keep the oxygen handy. And then there's the romance. Mallory and Kevin were much more than childhood sweethearts but it ended badly. The tension between the two is palpable. Hurt and anger -- even bitterness -- threatens their future. Mallory in particular is paralyzed by past mistakes. She's lived in the shadow of guilt for so long she doesn't know how to let it go. There's a powerful inspirational thread about forgiveness and what it can mean for second chances. A faith thread that is repeated among other characters in the book as well. Compelling stuff. Another brilliant romantic suspense by an incredibly gifted author. You need to read Mermaid Moon. Really. Truly.

Then trying to reach him as fast as you can, with the hope that you can save him. This is basically what happened to Mallory fifteen years ago, and now she is returning home under similar circumstances. Last time she felt responsible for the death of her mother, and now her father\u2019s last words were to find her mother. Strange words from a dying man that lead us on an adventure to save her and her daughters lives. Someone is really out to wipe out this family and to hide their trail, and around every corner is new danger and surprises. This book really flows and I had to keep reading and enjoying, sometimes with my heart in my throat, to find the answers here.

I am really enjoying this series and can't say enough good things about it. In addition to Mystery, Suspense and Romance it had a great message about forgiving one another or others and also forgiving yourself for any past mistakes or regrets. I loved the symbolism at the end of letting go. Mermaid Moon had a lot of mysteries that you were strung along with and the whole time you were trying to figure out who dunnit, or what are they up to, with a total complete mystery that snuck up on you out of the blue ( I didn't see that coming!) It kept me anxiously wanting to know who, what and why and like the first book The Inn at Oceans Edge, I couldn't put the book down until i got to the end. I found the story intriguing in the beginning and then unstoppable towards the end. Colleen Coble fans won't be disappointed and suspense romance lovers will be in heaven.

I enjoyed getting to know Mallory and Kevin. Kevin was a dear, kind man, devoted to his job, his blind daughter and Mallory. The story was fairly predictable (I figured out who the real mom was early on) but not the dad, nor the reason for the mystery until near the end. I would've liked to have seen more of Sadie in the story, too. However, that said, I did enjoy reading MERMAID MOON and while it wasn't my favorite Colleen Coble book, it wasn't my least favorite either. I enjoyed the Maine setting and Mallory's tenaciousness.

I was certainly hooked from the beginning.Fifteen years previously Mallory left her home town following her adopted mother's death. Now she returns with her daughter Haley in tow as well as her friend and neighbour Carol, as Mallory's father turns up dead in suspicious circumstances. Mallory meets up with ex boyfriend Kevin. The two of them turn super sleuth to solve a mystery dating back fifteen years.There are many themes within the novel including that of guilt. Mallory blames herself for her adopted mother's death. For fifteen years she has carried her burden. Her Aunt Blanche tells her \"don't ruin your life because you think that is all you deserve.\" Mallory is trapped by her own guilt. She thinks that God is punishing her. She is unaware that her prison is of her own making. Mallory needs to take all her guilt to God and move forward in her own life.Tied in with the guilt theme is that of forgiveness. Until Mallory can forgive herself, she will be forever trapped in the past.There are some very angry characters within Mermaid Moon. Some feel their anger is justified but it is merely leading to bitterness and ruined lives. Others are angry because they have been hurt. \"Trust was hard to drudge up out of pain.\" They need to take their hurt and pain and anger and give it to God, and learn to trust again.Money plays a major part within the novel. There are very rich characters and there are characters who are just making ends meet. Money can be used for good but the love of money above all else will ultimately lead to evil and the downfall of a greedy person.The theme of family permeates the novel. There are many different families - blood family; adopted family; single parent families - what they all have in common is love. Love will unite families and create bonds that will not be broken.The characters are all exceedingly well drawn. It was easy to empathise with young widow Mallory trying to raise her daughter whilst struggling with money and wracked with guilt. As the reader I longed to see her give herself a break and move on from her past. As her Aunt Blanche wisely said \"God isn't holding it over your head, you're the only one doing that.\" Kevin too was a struggling single parent to a daughter Sadie who had been blind from birth. Sadie was delightfully drawn and bought out the mothering instinct in me.Mermaid Moon was a great story. It kept me guessing to the end and had me on the edge of my seat. It is the perfect blend of mystery and romance."}, {"userName": "Victor Gentile", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528881-victor-gentile", "userReview": "Colleen Coble in her new book \u201cMermaid Moon\u201d Book Two in the Sunset Cove series published by Thomas Nelson gives us an adventure with Mallory Davis.From the back cover: Mallory\u2019s mother died fifteen years ago.

Possibly there is a cold case in that her mother was murdered. Now she is convinced that her father was murdered. On top of that both Mallory and her daughter are receiving death threats both at home and at the Point. Obviously someone wants to wipe out the whole family.

I didn't connect as easily with the characters or the story. However, Mermaid Moon does bring the same mix of romance and suspense that the first book did, with the same sort of twisting and interconnecting mystery.When Mallory receives a strange phone call from her father, she knows something is wrong. Her first instinct is to reach out to Game Warden Kevin O'Connor, someone she hasn't spoken to in fifteen years. But returning home brings Mallory even more questions and places them all in serious danger.Mermaid Moon has no shortage of mysteries, from Mallory's guilt-ladened past to the suspicious death of her father, the strange mention of her mother and the person who is following her and her daughter. And all this in just the first quarter of the story. And there were plenty of heart-stopping moments to go along with these secrets. Mermaid Moon also quickly builds the romantic tension. Mallory and Kevin have a past, one that has left them both feeling hurt. They each moved on from their shared history but were never able to shake the guilt and shame they carried. Reuniting offers them a chance to air their past mistakes and maybe even start over. Mermaid Moon also continues Claire and Luke's story from book one, but each book in this series could be read as standalones.
