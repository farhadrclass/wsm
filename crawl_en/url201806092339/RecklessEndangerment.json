Even now, after reading the words \"the end\", I'm still wanting more of Hope and Michael's story. It's a very different concept--at least from the books I can recall offhand. I loved the originality of the plot and the characters. I can see this as a movie--hint, hint to anyone out there listening! Hope is the kind of woman who would probably intimidate me in real life--at least at first--but she's also the kind of woman I'd be honored to call a friend. The back cover of this book talks about heroes--and that is a theme that carries throughout the book. This is a timely book--the issues are relevant to today's society--but it didn't feel pushed down our throats. The plot, the characters, the EMOTION blew my mind. This author has definitely made it onto my favorite author's list! I've just read all three of her books in two weeks--lol. I hope there's more to come because this reader is now a fan."}, {"userName": "Christoph Fischer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13998364-christoph-fischer", "userReview": "I was interested in \u201cReckless Endangerment\u201d by Amber Lea Easton because of some of her non-fiction work that had quite impressed me and I wanted to see how her talent would show in a different genre.From the first page is was evident how well Easton can draw her readers into the story and how skilful she creates characters that we instantly will want to know more about. The wounded Afghanistan war veteran Michael and his journalist love interest Hope are far from one dimensional creations and the problems they face in their strange relationship are much more gripping than a mere \u2018taming-of-the-shrew\u2019 scenario. Both characters have a lot to keep you interested in them and make you want them to succeed and grow. Although this book is marketed as romantic suspense it also covers some serious issues, such as people trafficking and post-traumatic stress disorder, adding further depth to a book that is rich in plot and personal conflict already. Nothing prepared me for the literary quality of this novel. Regular romance and suspense fans get more than enough here to be satisfied by the great chemistry between the main characters and the intriguing story lines. However, if you \u2013 like myself \u2013 want a little bit more out of a book than you will find it in the well-handled and insightful passages about trafficking and PSD, issues that are handled with care rather than in an exploitative or decorative manner. Easton clearly cares about what she writes and it pays dividends, her book is surprisingly impressive and certainly recommended."}, {"userName": "Shirley", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20609986-shirley", "userReview": "I'm not very good at writing reviews, but I highly recommend this novel so am giving it my best shot. From the first moment, when the reader meets Colonel Michael Cedars, it's obvious that this is going to be a deeper novel than the typical romantic suspense. It deals with a wounded marine (Michael) and his wife (Hope) who is an investigative reporter involved in a human trafficking story in Colorado. All I can really say is--WOW. This novel blew me away--I even cried at times, becoming so involved with the emotional journey the characters go on--and laughed--and really rooted for them all through the book. I love romantic suspense novels, have read one other from this author that prompted me to read this one (Riptide--LOVE THE ENDING), and am definitely going to look for more from this author."}, {"userName": "Novel Grounds", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5642762-novel-grounds", "userReview": "http://Novelgrounds.comhttp://www.facebook.com/novelgroundsThis book was Ah-Mazing! If I could give it 10 stars I would. Hope and Michael <3 Gosh what an epic story they have. This book is full of action, love, struggles, and mystery. Hope is an Investigative reporter and Michael is a recovering War hero. That right there should give you a heads up to how epic this story is. Every chapter is crammed with major events, but still Amber Easton manages to give you the heart felt character exchanges that make the story beautiful. I seriously could not put it down. Mind Blown.Each character was well developed and you learned about each one throughout the story. Not only Michael and Hope, but all the supporting characters were very present. This fact enveloped you even more into the story. You are drawn into the drama and mystery right from the start. With Michael being a PITA and Hope being a spitfire this book never lets down. The Ending is perfect as well. I honestly have nothing to say negative at all about this book.So Go buy it. Its worth it and its ah-mazing. 5 stars for sure. Be sure to review it as well!!!"}, {"userName": "ALI", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9054530-ali", "userReview": "Fabulous novel! I didn't want it to end. I started out reading the prequel that the author posted on her website (yes, I'm a fan) so was hooked before reading page one of this new release. The storyline was unexpected...which is refreshing to find in a romantic suspense novel. The story and the characters feel like they've been ripped from the news. Riveting. I liked that the hero (a war vet from Afghanistan, a marine) is partially paralyzed, yet written about as the sexy, smart guy he is. And the heroine--I'd like to have a beer with her sometime. She's the kind of heroine that you root for, cry for, and really feel for throughout the story. The couple is perfect together--their love story feels authentic and bigger than life. They're both heroes...and what a great idea for a story. I'm sure I will read this again and again in the future, it's that kind of story. Once again, this author delivered a blockbuster story that deserves to see the big screen one day. I highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5906134-anna", "userReview": "This is the third book I've read by this author and I wasn't disappointed. Reckless Endangerment was an emotional whirlpool that sucked me in and took my breath away. The love story between Hope and Michael is epic. I love that they start the story as a married couple. Once again, Ms. Easton spins a smart and unique tale that I couldn't put down. I read this in one night! I can't recommend this high enough. Buy this book! If you haven't bought her previous two books, buy them, too! You won't be disappointed. This author is one to watch...I guarantee she's going to be a household name one day.

You won't be disappointed with this novel. The author did a great job handling the PTSD and physical challenges of the story without being overt about it--I mean, not overly \"in your face\". From the first page, I felt intensely connected to the characters and was pulled into the suspense plot. Great romantic suspense novel, touching love story, and very well done across the board.

It's full of likable and fully fleshed-out characters, realistically depicted issues related to the aftermath of war, and it presented a fast-paced mystery surrounding human trafficking that kept me on the edge of my seat. It shows that atrocities not only occur in faraway lands but outside our front door as well. As two people deal both mentally and physically with the hand war dealt them it's only through love and acceptance that true healing can begin and a HEA can be fully achieved.Hope Shane gives the impression of being a total badass who can handle any situation. She loves being in the thick of things and is totally dedicated to the causes and few people she cares about. Some might call her cold but she's actually intensely devoted and focused on doing what's right to the exclusion of all else, including her own safety. Her work is the most important thing to her until she met, and secretly married, Colonel Michael Cedars in the middle of the war in Afghanistan. It's in a dark room where they plan for the future and enjoy quiet moments of happiness keeping the war at bay. Their dreams come crashing down as he's severely injured and tries to push her away and deny her existance out of fear. She's a strong-willed woman though who has no intention of giving him up and forces her way back into his life. Her strong outer shell hides her inner turmoil and flashes of PTSD from all the death she's witnessed. I ached to see her moments of weakness as they were so contradictory to how she presents herself. Her latest story puts her right in the thick of a battle at home involving human trafficking that puts her life in jeopardy as well as those around her. Once again Michael's in danger but thankfully they have each other to turn to as the danger is closer than they ever expected. Even though she struggles with survivor's guilt throughout the story she never lets things beat her. No matter how often she's knocked down, she gets right back up to stand by her man and her convictions.Michael Cedars has always been a man in control, so his paralysis is especially frustrating as he now has little control of anything. As a quadriplegic myself I found his feelings believable and the cycle of emotions he goes through towards acceptance realistic. His own body has betrayed him through its weakness that mentally makes him feel like less than a man. He's used to taking care of others but now must be taken care of. At first he pushes Hope away as he wants her to have someone better than him. Through her support and presence though he realizes he's still the man he was, just a slightly different one, that she needs no matter what. He too can admit that he needs her and wants to fulfill those dreams they once made. He accepts her as she is even as others call her reckless. As they reunite in the home she planned for long ago their connection deepens and the hurts they've buried deep inside slowly heal. Love is a healing balm and leads to an immensely satisfying conclusion.Hope and Michael are both flawed characters who sometimes hurt each other in their verbal battles. They love each other wholeheartedly and unconditionally. Their love was vital to them both and as the story progressed they realized how much they'd give up to be together. Their journey towards a HEA was heartbreaking at times but ultimately cheer-inducing. The life of a wheelchair user was presented vividly and accurately and pulled no punches in dealing with the physical, mental, and emotional issues of having a body that's no longer yours to control. The sexual aspects were also dealt with sensitively yet believably. The mystery Hope gets caught up in went on a bit too long but definitely kept me on the edge of my seat guessing whodunit due to its numerous twists and turns. The secondary characters were larger than life with each leaving a lasting impression. This story drew me in completely from page one and kept me immersed in its grittiness until the very satisfying end and I wholeheartedly recommend it to others. This was my first time reading a book from this author but her impressive storytelling has me wanting to come back for more and I look forward to her future releases."}, {"userName": "Cooper", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21856915-cooper", "userReview": "Wonderful novel, one of the most well written and best developed that I've read in a long time.

Good solid characters and good sold character development. I think I just wanted more. It probably sounds shallow but I really don't care too much about story lines that don't aid in the development of the characters or the relationship between the characters and this was one of those for me.I think I would have liked it better from the war point of view when they were getting together under really difficult circumstances rather than them getting back together once they returned from war. The ending was good where they were working together but the rest of it was just distracting from the actual relationship.I also struggle with lots and lots of characters. Parents, sisters, brothers in law, step sons, best friends, colleagues etc etc. It is very hard to keep up with that many extras along with complicated relationships and life threatening work situations.I personally prefer these complications to have a bearing on the relationship not just an addition to the story.
