To try and resolve this conflict she went to Afghanistan at the time of the Soviet invasion and was propelled into the world of the mujahidin. She was twenty-one years old, and beautiful: dangerous some would think, but she spoke Farsi, knew all their traditions; they treated her as one of them. Her courage is such that even reading about some of her exploits is frightening. This book will speak not only to the many people who admire the Afghan people and pity their ordeals, but to those like Saira Shah who owe allegiance to two cultures \u2026 more and more of them now in the world.\nSaira Shah shares her memories of discovering the country of her parents when she becomes a journalist and travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan to find her father's paradise. She grew up with the old stories he shared and his nostalgia of a life before politics and international warfare in these countries destroyed everything. Beautiful gardens, unforgettable vistas made room for human suffering on an unimaginable scale. \nFew invaders cared for this desolate crossroads of Asia where, the Afghans say, when God finished making the world, he laughed and threw down his rubbish\nShe kept going back to find the other half of herself. \nTwo people live inside me. Like a couple who rarely speak, they are not compatible. My Western side is a sensitive, liberal, middle-class pacifist. My Afghan side I can only describe as a rapacious robber baron. It revels in bloodshed, glories in risk and will not be afraid\nDespite the suffering and hardships, her paternal country grew on her. Captured her soul.\nI began my quest for truth peddling lies in the offices of Fleet Street editors. I spoke fluent Persian; I was personally known to most of the mujahidin leaders; I was an experienced reporter, hardened to combat. Even as I uttered these outrageous falsehoods, I marvelled that anyone could believe them. I didn\u2019t realize it then but, unconsciously, I was following in the footsteps of the very myths I was trying to put behind me.\nThis is a deeply heartfelt story. I was at times so traumatized that I just couldn't continue reading. Yet, the well-written prose of this documentary memoir kept me coming back. Saira Shah shares her experience behind the documentary film she made and the challenges they had to endure to introduce the outside world to a region of the world where many people still haven't seen airplanes and where some groups live so remote, that they were, by the grace of God, not affected by the war.Afghanistan have become a country where murder, death, the ending of a life, left no room for conscience, regret or tears. Where fighting is a job opportunity, and where drug and weapon smuggling are the game of politicians from different countries. A fascinating but very sad read. The prose is in the journalese style. The emotions behind it is left for the reader to discover. It has a powerful impact. Doris Lessing sums up this book perfectly: \n\u2018This is a remarkable and essential book about Afghanistan which succeeds in describing the people of that country \u2014 men and also women \u2014 their identities, hopes, fears, generosity and cruelties, all of which have too long been buried under the rubble of endless geopolitical clashes. It is alive with detail, emotion, myth, fable, bleeding reality and those laughs and freedoms which arise defiantly out of the darkest of times to assert the human spirit. Saira Shah\u2019s descriptions of her relatives - Auntie Soraya with her folded painted face, for example \u2014 are written from the position of an intimate who is also an outsider with values which do not forgive the unforgivable. The murders, threats, violence of life in the Afghanistan she has previously only known in the stories fail to really disarm this brave woman with enviable verve and imagination.\u2019\nIn the end I cried for the little children."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "This book is a MUST-READ! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. Why? Because it is a marvelous balancing act of the stories, myths and philosophical beliefs of Afghanistan and a clear presentation of historical facts, Afghanistan's passage from the Soviet take-over in 1980 to the mujahidin control 1992-1996 and thereafter Afghanistan under the Talibans through 2001 and 9/11. The author's struggle wih her own Afghan identity is a very important part of the book. It helps the reader further understand the Afghan character.

As Saira Shah's journeys into Afghanistan lead her to see into, then beyond, her romantic dreams of its culture, we accompany her step by step. Her writing is vivid and immediate, capturing images of individuals, war in mountains and in towns and the many ways in which strong traditional ties hold people into place like great steel cables.It is no mean achievement that the her insights remain fresh and relevant even though the book was published 10 years ago.Doris Lessing is quoted on the front cover as saying 'This is an extraordinary book by a remarkable young woman. There is not likely to be a better one about Afghanistan'. It is brilliant AND highly readable."}, {"userName": "Kiersten", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/659087-kiersten", "userReview": "This book was very eye-opening. I loved the insights about the Afghani myths and culture. However, by the end of the book, I was really tired about listening to her wax philosophical and whiny about how she couldn't reconcile her eastern heritage with her western upbringing, and about how she couldn't find herself, when there were actual atrocities and horrors unfolding all around her. At one point, after she had knowingly dishonored her family and her beloved uncle by moving in with her boyfriend, she recounted how a mujahadin who had been protected and supported by her uncle had destroyed his home when he ran out of money and were no longer able to be of assistance. Instead of expressing sadness over what had befallen her uncle and his family, she bemoaned the fact that her idealized vision of the noble mujahadin had been destroyed. I found this a little bit distasteful. Then, at the end of the book, she compared her childhood in Kent, England, to that of three young Afghani girls who had been raped by the Taliban after seeing their mother murdered in front of them. She wondered if they could possibly want to escape, just like she had wanted to do as a teen. My thought was \"yeah, they probably do. But not because they're naive girls bored with their upper-class lifestyle. It probably has more to do with the fact that their countrymen are being murdered, their family has been destroyed, and they are starving to death.\" I know she was there to chronicle the disaster, a very worthy and necessary cause, but she was there for decades, put a lot of people's lives in danger in her attempts to enter Afghanistan and cover the war, and she only made one weak attempt to help anyone. It's a little strong to say that I found her to be self-absorbed, but I'm kind of leaning toward that conclusion."}, {"userName": "Lilisa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7209729-lilisa", "userReview": "A well-done memoir of a young woman seeking her roots, restless in the land where she was born (in Britain) but feeling very much at home in the land of her forefathers - Afghanistan. Saira Shah recalls the stories her father shared with her and her siblings growing up - about his parents and the land of beautiful mountains, crisp streams, the wonderful food and the warmth and camaraderie of family and friends. She was fortunate to have had the opportunity to visit Afghanistan as a young girl and experience the land firsthand, including the unexplainable pull that country had on her. At twenty-one, she heads to Afghanistan as a novice investigative reporter during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and travels with the rebels under extremely dangerous situations. As she immerses herself in all things Afghan, we are afforded the opportunity - through her eyes - to live and experience the richness of the Afghan culture, the warmth of its people and the art of storytelling handed down through the ages. A great read (or listen, as I did) and well paced book that ended way too soon."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1927524-nick", "userReview": "An elegy for Afghanistan by a journalist who was there during the war with Russia and went back after the towers were destroyed; unlike a lot of these books, it was written by someone of Afghani descent, the daughter of Idries Shah, who did so much to popularize Sufism in the West. So, in addition to the appalling stories and tales of Western misunderstanding, Saira Shah explores her roots, grapples with her love for the country of her ancestors, and finds her relatives. The relatives, by the way, furnish the source of one of the best stories I have ever read, as one tries to marry the teenage Shah off to a local man only to be outwitted by a maiden aunt. Her descriptions of the forbidding landscape are lyrical, her untangling of the even more convoluted and treacherous politics clear, her passion for the country and its people deep and genuine. She quotes Rumi (who lived in what is now Afghanistan) and the Gulistan with ease. Books by Westerners on the Afghan conflict tend to focus on the educated class because that is who the authors can speak to directly. For the first time, I felt as though I was reading an author who understood the many Afghans who are not and whose purpose was to convey their feelings and even words effectively, perhaps because she could converse with them in their languages. There are the usual stories of American malfeasance, parachuting supplies in of things that Afghans do not eat, and in any case usually to the wrong people, the vigorous market in the Stinger weapons that Charlie Wilson fought so hard to give the mujahedin. The refugees in Pakistan produced great amounts of aid and investment, most of it going to service organizations, local businessmen and, Shah is honest enough to point out, journalists. Shah is heartbreaking on what she could not do, not finding the lovely, peaceful Afghanistan of her family lore in violent ruin and failing to help even the subjects of a documentary she filmed. She is beyond heartbreaking on a number of other stories, which should be read rather than paraphrased here. I will limit myself to Abdul Haq, the mujahedin who in exile argued for a peaceful approach in what had been the Afghan tradition of side-switching, only to be executed by the Taliban shortly after he returned to implement his ideas. There are many tragedies in this book, but perhaps the greatest is Shah's perception that the way of Abdul Haq is gone, that there is a generation of people who grew up during these violent decades and have lost everything but the one thing they know how to do, which is to make war."}, {"userName": "Antof9", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1717549-antof9", "userReview": "It's hard to know what to say about this book. I said a lot of it in the journal entry for the audio version. I am so glad I was introduced to this book. It's such a great \"Current Events\" class without all the traditional dry \"clip an article from the paper and come to class prepared to talk about it\". I don't know if it makes sense or not, but one of the things about this book that resonates with me is her desire to call a country her own. My dad was in the (American) Air Force, and although I love travel and change, there have been many times in my life that I felt I didn't have a place to call \"home\", and when people ask where I'm from, I often don't have an answer.I love this: \"For the first time in my life I was nufus-dar, the Afghan term that means literally 'having people' - but which conveys a sense of safety and belonging. I had found my tribe.\" For years when living far from family, my family made family from friends around us. The other funny thing to me about that is that the word \"nufus\" is also about people in Turkish. When we lived in Turkey, we noticed that as you entered each town, you'd see a sign with the name of the town, and underneath it the population count. The word for \"population\" was \"nufus\"!Here's something else that struck me, and I'll end with this:\n  It struck me that a sense of humour may be the opposite of fanaticism, or at least its antidote. It is difficult to dream of martyrdom if you can see the funny side of life. Of course, the great Afghan poet Jalaluddin Rumi got there centuries before me, and said it better: \"If you have no sense of humour, then you have an incompleteness in your soul.\""}, {"userName": "Rehana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3041790-rehana", "userReview": "Liked the historical aspect of the book but author's personal journey lacked real depth for my interest.

But her father's stories steeped her in the culture of the old country, and she yearned to visit the magic kingdom that she was sure was her true home. From her first visit at seventeen, she was hooked, even though the reality of Afghanistan she found as a journalist was very different from the beautiful dream she chased. Embedding herself with the mujahidin who fought the invading Soviet troops, she climbed frozen mountains and dodged bullets, a lone woman dressed as a man, watching warriors die in front of her eyes. She witnessed the defeat of the Soviets and the evolution of the Taliban and its religious-military tyranny. In 2001 she again risked her life sneaking into Afghanistan in a burqa to make the CNN documentary Beneath the Veil and later returning in a futile effort to get three girls orphaned by war into a school. Shah's courage is awe-inspiring. As a woman and a journalist, she sought the truth about Afghanistan for both herself and the outside world. She never found the mythical kingdom she hoped for, but she opens our eyes to the real history and people of this remote and mysterious place where millions have been displaced and killed, including American troops. Her revelation of the many tragedies of the Afghan people make those sacrifices a little more understandable.

As an adult her longing to find her ancestral land takes her into the violence and upheaval of an Afghanistan torn apart by years of invaders. It's a difficult, though moving, story of the time she spent as a journalist in a land she beautifully describes. I now have a much better grasp of Afghanistan's convoluted history and the mindset of it's people. At one point when the Northern Alliance and the Talliban are attacking and counter-attacking, Shah asks what the point of all this is. The soldiers looked at her as if she were mad. They said \"It is war. This is Afghanistan.\" For people who's land has been destroyed by decades of abuse and who no longer have or even know what had been their traditional means of making a living, she was told, \"This country is full of men who know nothing except how to fight.

I'd heard of her documentary Beneath the Veil, but have not watched it. Therefore, I didn't have any previously established expectations coming into this book.What surprised me is how much more of an identity narrative it was than a discussion of events (several of them extraordinary) that the author experienced. And because I didn't pick up the book to read about that -- I picked up the book in an effort to learn and understand more about Afghanistan's recent history and how the author was uniquely positioned to discuss that -- I was a little disappointed. The book is interesting -- fascinating, even. The author has a gumption that registers to epic levels. She witnessed the unfolding of a time when the roots of extremism were sown, even though she admits herself she didn't understand it all while it was happening. She brings in a lot of ancient tales and fables, and references to Rumi's poetry, which I loved and which definitely lived up to what I thought I'd read based on the title alone. However, I didn't expect the book to jump around quite so much. The reader is taken through an intense experience and then, almost formulaically, given a relevant fable and then thrust forward into another time and place in the author's life, often without quite understanding the real facts of what happened. I think that's what bothered me the most. I didn't ever feel like I was given the \"real facts\" -- as though they weren't important enough for the author to give to us. For example, she discusses the mujahid leader she accused of selling arms to Iran in one of her journalistic pieces, and even describes her meeting with him afterward -- but she doesn't give his name. Why not? His name clearly appeared in her reporting at the time, so it can't be a secret. It just added to the overall feeling of being fed bits and pieces of a whole picture. I did glean some new bits of information from the book, which I enjoyed, such as references to the Nuristanis and the Kochis. But that is not the purpose of this book. (And such is the danger of autobiographies. I know.) I realize that sometimes authors write things for the public, and sometimes they write things for themselves. It seems as though this was likely written more as a cathartic piece for the author herself -- perhaps with some coaxing from editors along the way. Quite frankly, I found a few lines utterly puzzling. After discussing how she feels part Eastern, part Western (an understandable sentiment with a particular set of difficulties), there is almost an attempt at a climax when she states that finally she couldn't reconcile the two and her Western side took over when she set up house as an unmarried woman with the Swiss reporter she had been working closely with. My practical side thought -- really? This is the moment? Because clearly a) escaping an arranged marriage and b) working as a single woman journalist in Pakistan at the edge of Afghanistan and traveling into Afghanistan regularly (having to disguise herself as a boy sometimes and having to cover herself with the burqa at others) puts her solidly in the Western camp. She's constantly coming against barriers set in place by \"Eastern\" culture and finding ways to scale them -- not always quietly, either-- and she admits to frequenting Western bars and hotels during her stay in that region as well. Why pick the moment when she decides to live with her reporter partner as the ultimate time when the \"Western side won\"? It almost felt... cliche. I'm going to fault the editor(s) for that one. It just didn't make sense. Anyway, what one comes away with in the book is the immensity of both the tragedy and the peculiar strength of Afghanistan and the ways in which those things ripple through the ages to today. I must go to books to experience Afghanistan in any way -- I admit I'll never go to see it in person. However, books are where we all must go to experience the Afghanistan of the past. Ever changing, ever mysterious, tragically changed and scarred forever and yet still enchanting -- it has the potential to pull us all under its spell."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron", "userReview": "Part memoir, part reportage, this beautifully written book is also an inquiry into the nature of myth, identity, and the limits of human endurance. Born in England and raised on the memories of her Afghan father's homeland, the author journeys as a young journalist to Afghanistan during the Soviet Occupation in the 1980s, traveling with the mujahidin rebels, who with massive infusions of weapons from the CIA eventually drive out the Russians and then quickly succumb again to an equally destructive civil war and the inevitable tyranny of the Taliban. A witness to these struggles and the widespread human misery they caused, Shah is present again in 2002 as the Americans retaliate in response to the 9/11 attacks.Through it all, she ponders her deep identification with the people of this war-torn land, fired by the cultural myths that have sustained them through millenia of invasions, occupations, and civil strife, where fierce tribal allegiances and a fatalistic fearlessness make death, brutality, and suffering a common experience. Over a period of 15 years, her belief in the myths is tested, and she begins to fully comprehend not only the immensity of the human cost of the war but the extreme difficulty of making a difference for those of its casualties most in need of help.Writing with a skilled reporter's powers of acute observation and an ability to convey images of people, places, and events in vivid and compelling prose, Shah interweaves stories, Afghan poems and sayings, and even humor, with accounts of her work as a journalist behind the lines. Readers unfamiliar with the last 50 years of Afghan history may be disoriented as Shah tells her own story, skipping as it does from one point in time to another. But read along with books like Christina Lamb's \"The Sewing Circles of Herat\" and Jason Eliot's \"An Unexpected Light,\" she provides insights into her subject that are revealing, moving, and often riveting.

The more I read memoirs and personnel histories of Middle Asia the more I see what a pack of lies Washington has told us since the Regan era. Saira Shahs' book is remarkable. She tell of the beauty of her homeland and how different it was/is from her home in Kent. She tells of towering mountains, beautiful valleys, rushing rivers, and the brutality of war: shelling's mortar attacks, refugees, wounded with no medical care, hospitals with hundreds in wards just waiting to die and all the other detritus of conflict. She also talks about what Washington wishes she wouldn't: the corruption that we encouraged, the sale of Stinger missiles to Iran that were supposed to be used by the Mhajadeen(SP), the illiteracy of the new ruling class after Russia evacuated, the Taliban. One pointed sentence tells all. She is in Kandahar province and is asked to debate with the local Mullah the finer points of the Koran. She starts in Persian, which he speaks, but then speaks in Arabic which he can not understand. She switches back to Persian saying they should conduct the debate in Persian so she can work on her Persian. This saves the illiterate Mullahs' ego and they talk. This guy became a Taliban leader. He can't speak Arabic and is a leading Religious Scholar? back in 92 when I was talking with the Turkish AF Mullah at Incirlick he told me that \"You can't really understand the Koran when it is translated into English. It MUST be read in Arabic and chanted in Arabic and discussed in Arabic.\" And I've heard this from almost every Koranic Scholar that I have read or listened to. I repeat this Kandahar Mullah could not speak or read Arabic and was one of the leaders of the Taliban. Some reality here. The U.S. is spending 100 dead and a 1000 critically wounded a year to fight of bunch of illiterate religious fanatics. And were loosing> Isn't it about time we come up with a new strategy? Maybe people like Ms. Shah or Greg Mortenson, Three Cups of tea, could help us work a new plan. People who aren't trying to sell more weapons systems to the U.S. Government and instead want to find peace with out religious tyranny for Afghanistan and also the rest of SW Asia that the U.S. has screwed up in the past 26 years.Back to the book, if you are tired of continual news reports that come from Pentagon briefings about how well were doing but our troops, my Comrades in Arms, can't come home yet, If you want to arm your self with some reality of what is and was happening on the ground in SW Asia, this is a must read.

Shah's take on what she thought she knew was sorrowful, yet telling about what we as humans want the most. That is, we want what we can imagine, which is usually only pleasantry, and other fortune words. Shah wanted Afghanistan to be a magical land full of fruits and flowers, instead what she got was realism. To me, I found it silly to every believe a mystical land could every exists, but then, I realize that maybe I, myself, do not romanticize my place of origin, but I do romanticize past life ways. I romanticize the Mongols, and the 1920s American prosperity. So I cannot fall her for being so naive. Perhaps this is a western thing? Whenever Shah wrote about her thoughts in a moment, it felt as if she was taking a very western approach. She was continuously baffled as to why she was not being acknowledge as apart of Afghan, when in fact, she was doing the most western thing, that is, to want people to identify you as you want, to will over the people. Toward the end of the book, when she stopped trying so hard, we see one person identify her as Afghani.Shah is strong in bringing the reading with her, she is humorous, and brings in beautiful stories, and also speaks of tragedies that have caused horrible pain. The journey of reading the book therefore, is relative as to how Shah herself felt in some of these situations. She bring in humor primarily because a situation is uncomfortable, her potential marriage to a cousin, her potential death as a journalist. Her stories however, are to show how she perceived Afghanistan's culture, and outsiders, and how she should now perceive life after finding out her homeland is not what she was told. The violence in the book, is what it is, sad and gross. Their are written quite journalists, as if Shah is trying to remove herself from what what she recalls. Overall the book is worth reading, especially if you have no idea what has happened in Afghanistan.

Her dreams of a paradise-like garden conjured from the stories her father told of Afghanistan were never to be realized. I learned a great deal, for instance, that Afghanistan has always been at war. Since the time of Alexander the Great, four centuries before Christ to today, they have been conquered or fought off conquerors from neighbor countries. Her time in the country during the Russian occupation and subsequent years under the Taliban give amazing insight into the destruction of the countryside and its people. Her harrowing journeys thru the mountains of Afghanistan are emblematic either of her courage or stupidity. One passage that struck me, when she is trying to sneak into the country from Pakistan and must pass thru a Taliban border post, she writes, \"I require no documents.

Also immensely enjoyed the introduction to the \"real\" Afghanistan that is more than just the war(s), and kind of wished there was more about it. I learned a lot about the country and also about my personal limitations (I didn't know anything about Afghanistan except the Taliban). But there was something that made the story not substantial enough. Not enough content, or at least not enough stretches of deep content. I'll nevertheless give it another try again later on, because the foundations of the book, both her personal search for her identity as well as her profound love for the real Afghanistan, are worth the effort."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3183260-emily", "userReview": "Interesting book made up of romantic stories of a nation told by a father to the daughter's own experience in the war-torn country of Afghanistan.

The author\u2019s narrative style is enjoyable and easy to read. Ms. Shah, a British journalist, intersperses Afghan and family history, philosophy and legends with her personal experiences. When a little girl her father told her stories about Afghanistan and later said, \u201cI\u2019ve given you stories to replace a community. They are your community.\u201dVery early in the book she relates some of her experiences while filming \u201cBeneath the Veil.\u201d She is traveling with RAWA and describes choking under the burqa and speaks of its coarse veil as being like prison bars. She discusses Taliban rules and compares them to own Sufism. She writes of her visit to Taliban women\u2019s hospital and describes it as filthy, with no medicine, little medical care, and families must feed patients or they starve. In a lament she notes: \u201cthey [Taliban:] have corrupted all the qualities I grew up believing to be quintessentially Afghan: generosity of spirit, courage, boundless self-confidence and, above all, a sense of humor.\u2019 While her Scottish Grandmother\u2019s diary spoke of the beauty of Kabul, the city is now all rubble.A majority of the book is about her experiences. As a young girl of 17 she travels to Pakistan to attend a wedding and meet her extended family for first time. She relates her Uncle\u2019s offer to arrange a marriage with a cousin in Peshawar and then the antics her Aunt pulls to extricate the author from the situation. The marriage ceremony she was attending was two weeks long with the men being free to enjoy it. To Ms. Shan the bride looked like a bird with broken wing and the women were reserved.Her descriptions of her later stay in Peshawar as a journalist and her relations with her extended family are poignant. It is exciting to read about her travels with Pushtun tribesmen and the Mujahidin in the 80\u2019s. Interjecting politics she notes that thanks to the ISI (Pakistani Intelligence) the US [under Reagan:] nurtured a brand of extremist political Islam that, until now, had been almost unknown in Afghanistan. As regards Islam she writes: \u201calthough the world tends to view division within Islam in terms of schools and creeds, I believe there is a much more fundamental conflict. It is between those who cling to the literal letter of the Islamic law, and those who stress its inner values.\u201dIn Peshawar she developed a relationship with a Professor who was like a father figure/mentor. Before the Taliban emerged, the Mujahidin began eliminating the intelligentsia, moderates who could oppose them. Among them was Ms. Shah\u2019s professor. It was his murder that ended of myth of noble Mujahidin.Ms. Shah has written an exciting memoir. In what could be described as an adventure book she has woven Afghan history and legends in an easily read narrative of a female journalist\u2019s experiences in a patriarchal world."}, {"userName": "Marcella", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883423-marcella", "userReview": "I found this book completely absorbing. The author has written a story that is informative, illuminating, passionate and wrenching as she takes us along on her quest to know her home land... its mystique, its landscape and its people, her people.  I have read half a dozen or so books on Afghanistan recently, my own quest of sorts to understand better some thing of the history, culture, and traditions of a people I have not had the benefit of knowing except through the lens of war as presented in our media. Shah's story take us through the years of the years of the Soviet Invasion, the Taliban and post Taliban years. Having been born and raised in London, she travels to her homeland armed with the mysticism of her father's stories and finds herself struggling to reconcile the Eastern myths she has grownup with, her Western identity, and the Afghanistan she finds herself in. She writes with great honesty of the many conflicts that arise within her, and her passion for her homeland is undeniable despite the disappointment, disillusionment, heartache & dismay she experiences through the seemingly never ending warfare. She finds beauty and hardship in the landscape. She finds strength, generosity & loyalty as well as despair, depravity & brutality in the people.  One can't help but despair of a people who have known nothing but war for generations... some for whom warfare is their occupation, the means by which they support their family. A whole generation of young people who have NEVER know peace . Who know how to do nothing but fight... .This books illuminates for me the many ways that our ignorance ( arrogance) in the West make it impossible for our current involvement in Afghanistan to be successful. We can not hope to make a difference (or impose our will) on a people & culture for whom we remain so utterly uninformed, with out real a understanding. Many thanks to Saira Shah for writing an honest and passionate book that gives me a little better incite into the beauty and the brutality of her conflicted homeland. I am better for having read this book . I wish that there were more people who would take the time, make the effort to learn something of the history and culture of other people in this world. It might go a long ways towards opening up different avenues of conflict resolution . Or perhaps I'm just idealist. I hope not. I really believe..."}, {"userName": "Kathy Boozan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25059037-kathy-boozan", "userReview": "Spellbinding. A good introduction to the happenings in Afghanistan from the 80s. An intriguing mix of fable and fact -- a real eye-opener as to the condition of the land and the people of Afghanistan."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2953994-denise", "userReview": "This book was difficult for me to get through but I am glad I finally returned to it and finished it. The book is a very introspective, non-fiction account of a British reporter who spends years on and off in Afghanistan covering the Russian occupation and subsequent civil war. I think the reason I found it hard to read was because it is quite self indulgent and because I was stressed as I anticipated things getting worse as the story progresses. The time of the Taliban rule is horrendous to read about and the idea of covering it as female reporter spooks me to no end! \u201cThe Kite Runner\u201d was more than enough for me!Saira's father is from Afghanistan and she has been raised on the myths and legends of this land. She spends much of her adult life searching for a country and a people who have already been indelibly changed by events. The book is filled with her harrowing experiences, her hopes for a better future and her ultimate realization that the Afghanistan of her father\u2019s tales no longer exists. In the context of our current military involvement and the world\u2019s focus on this region, this book is well worth reading. In many ways, like Greg Mortenson\u2019s books, it humanizes the people of this regions and helps us to understand the complexity of their society and the issues faced by this struggling country."}], "description": "The vivid, often startling memoir of a young woman shaped by two dramatically disparate worlds. Saira Shah is the English-born daughter of an Afghan aristocrat, inspired by his dazzling stories to rediscover the now lost life their forebears presided over for nine hundred years within sight of the minarets and lush gardens of Kabul and the snow-topped mountains of the Hindu Kush. Part sophisticated, sensitive Western liberal, part fearless, passionate Afghan, falling in love with her ancestral myth-chasing Afghanistan-Shah becomes, at twenty-one, a correspondent at the front of the war between the Soviets and the Afghan resistance. Then, imprisoning herself in a burqa, she risks her life to film Beneath the Veil, her acclaimed record of the devastation of women's lives by the Taliban. Discovering her extended family, discovering a world of intense family ritual, of community, of male primacy, of arranged marriages, and finding at last the now war-ravaged family seat, she discovers as well what she wants and what she rejects of her extraordinary heritage.About the Author: Saira Shah lives in London and is a freelance journalist. She was born in Britain of an Afghan family, the daughter of Idries Shah, a writer of Sufi fables. She first visited Afghanistan at age twenty-one and worked there for three years as a freelance journalist, covering the guerilla war against the Soviet occupiers. Later, working for Britain's Channel 4 News, she covered some of the world's most troubled spots, including Algeria, Kosovo, and Kinshasa, as well as Baghdad and other parts of the Middle East. Her documentary Beneath the Veil was broadcast on CNN.", "title": "The Storyteller's Daughter: One Woman's Return to Her Lost Homeland", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106492.The_Storyteller_s_Daughter", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347562167l/106492.jpg", "reviews": 135, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/61661.Saira_Shah", "name": "Saira Shah"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Travel", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106492.The_Storyteller_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7669372-the-storyteller-s-daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9968691-storyteller-s-daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/302637.The_Storyteller_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1741926.The_Storyteller_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32731005-l-albero-delle-storie-il-ritorno-in-afghanistan-terra-di-leggenda-e-pat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130319-the-mouse-proof-kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35212771-una-cocina-a-prueba-de-ratones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29604023-mit-r-med-freya", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36553773-myszoodporna-kuchnia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34722948-mit-r-med-freya"]}
