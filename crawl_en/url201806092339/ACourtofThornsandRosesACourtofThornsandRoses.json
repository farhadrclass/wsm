DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail's pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions of Beauty and the Beast that I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I felt Cruel Beauty among other B&B retellings I've read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I'm sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything's just dandy and things will make sense, and I'd be like \"ooooooh, so that's why ____.\" Me, I don't care. Ain't nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I'm just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who's implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here's roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there's Belle's dad. Belle's dad wanders into Beast's castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn't like the fact that Belle's dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle's dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle's valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There's a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book. Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here's this version of Beauty and the Beast, a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely, from the little that I have read.There's Feyre who has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don't care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there's only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who's a Fae in disguise) away from her family.\n\u201cWhat is the payment the Treaty requires?\u201dHis eyes didn\u2019t leave my face as he said, \u201cA life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.\u201d\nA life for a life! Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That's what a life for a life means, right? WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.\n\u201cSome would say it\u2019s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,\u201d Tamlin ground out. \u201cSome would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.\u201d\nSo what?! Why?! This makes no sense at all. Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother. In exchange, there is absolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.\nAnother useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis\u2019s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic\u2014this one of purple so deep it could have been black.\nClearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they're revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape. It doesn't make any sense!\n \u201cThere is \u2026 a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act \u2026 strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks\u201d\u2014he tapped on his\u2014\u201care the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can\u2019t remove them.\u201d\nOver and over and over, the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.\n\u201cSo there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?\u201d Maybe they\u2019d know how to free me from the Treaty\u2019s terms.\u201cYes,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cThe Suriel. But they\u2019re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.\nAnd then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn't feel like it, because she is \"inconsequential.\" In fact, they're more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.\n\u201cMy morning work was postponed,\u201d he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. \u201cIf you want a ride across the grounds\u2014if you\u2019re interested in your new \u2026 residence, I can take you.\u201d\nAnd teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle's love for reading.\n\u201cI could help you write to them, if that\u2019s why you\u2019re in here.\u201d\nFeyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.\n\u201cDo you ever stop being such a prick?\u201d I snapped back.Dead\u2014really, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. \u201cMuch better.\u201d\nAs I said, I'm sure this book improves in the end, but from what I've read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue."}, {"userName": "Jillian (bookishandnerdy)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3101094-jillian-bookishandnerdy", "userReview": "INITIAL REACTION: WILL UPDATE WITH REVIEW LATER BUT KNOW I LOVED THIS.

The different Courts of faeries are an element that adds great originality to this story. At first, A Court of Thorns and Roses might appear similar to plenty of fantasy books already written out there but, the further you read, the more you come to descry its ingenious lines shaping the well-known classic sprinkled with beautiful themes and\u2026 sensuality.What was missing for me was action. I wanted more of it, as well as some adventure and deadly dangerous situations, which we do get, in the first chapters, but otherwise not until a good part of the novel. The pacing is quite slow, for the author chose to take her time building the relationship between Feyre, Tamlin, Lucien and even Alis, a servant. Surprisingly, there weren\u2019t as many characters as I expected. The world-building being focused on distinct Courts principally ruled by High Lords and dwelt by lesser faeries, I thought, deceptively so, that we were going to be introduced to so many of them!I have to say that Sarah J. Maas\u2019 writing is compelling. While she could have moderated her descriptions of paintings, for there were many of them and relatively long ones, even those didn\u2019t bore me. Feyre, the heroine, is both a huntress and painter. Never have I seen this mix of skills before in one person. Her strength won\u2019t go unnoticed and neither will her dauntlessness. There were moments in the story when I felt the need to growl at her, for her difficulty to obey orders \u2013 even if for her own protection \u2013 was bewildering!It\u2019s true what they say, Tamlin will make you swoon\u2026 *wink*Recommended to fans of Cruel Beauty, East and Beauty.--------------------------2016/06/29: Rating upped to 5 stars after second read.--------------------------Well, well, what do we have here?Original, amazingly looking cover?

She did not succeed. OK MORE REVIEW:I genuinely really enjoyed some aspects of this book, but I couldn't stand Feyre, or Tamlin... or anybody really, except for Lucien. I feel like Lucien was the only character who had an interesting back story, and he was just a much better presence than either of the main characters.BUT THE INSTALOVE. THE INSTALOVE, GUYS. IT KILLS ME. Also verrrrry problematic scenes, like when it was Feyre's fault for almost getting raped? can you not? \"GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM FEYRE BEFORE I DO SOMETHING BAD TO YOU\" wow whoa really not cool.On top of all that, I just found the plot to be incredibly boring. I started getting interested around the 200-page mark, but then it all just went back to being uninteresting again. I know in a status update I said that the book was slow, but what I should have said is that it was boring, because there is a huge difference. A book can be fast-paced and still be boring, and vice versa. I LOVE SLOW-PACED BOOKS. Have you seen how much I loved The Name of the Wind and the Game of Thrones books? THOSE ARE SLOW. BUT NOT BORING. THIS WAS BORING.That's how I felt anyway, it's my opinion. If you weren't bored by this book, that's awesome. However, I will never lie to you about my opinion.

I found I wasn't so concerned about rushing through to get to the next book; since I already knew what happens I was able to savor the details and carve out a tiny piece of my heart for Tam Tam (but not really because duh). On to the next one!3.5 STARS I am 100% embarrassed by how much I loved this book. Everything in the Humphrey household is going awry so it was wonderful being able to escape in Feyre's exciting problems and leave my own behind. There is nothing of substance to the book; it is fluffy, cheesy, and has been done multiple times over before, yet somehow I STILL was completely sucked in and couldn't put it down. I ate it up like candy and am looking forward to picking up ACOMAF. Holy cow I fell for Rhys so hard and WHY DO I ALWAYS LIKE THE ONE THAT THE GIRL NEVER PICKS?!?!?!?! I found myself utterly bored and despising the scenes with Feyre's father and sisters. I know they were necessary, but I almost put the book down as a DNF early on bc I could hardly get through those scenes. Not sure what else I can add that hasn't been said already a million times over, but this is a reheated \"Beauty and the Beast\" with side dishes of Cinderella and Twilight. (I'm still thinking about Thanksgiving food-sorry guys). I might hold off on the next book until a little closer to May so I'm not left hanging.

After seeing this book and its successors paint my feed with its courts and thorns and wings and ruin, I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding this series in general.And this first installment just didn't live up to it for me, sadly. There, there, Court Thornians...Quite frankly, the first 60% of this book dragged like a U-Haul trailer with no wheels. Nothing really happened and the things that did didn't even make sense until after the book was over. And I'm just not a fan of that. I like to enjoy books while I'm reading them, not only for the last 25-35% when everything that was murky throughout the whole book becomes clear. I also found myself WAY more interested in Rhysand than the actual love interest, Tamlin. Whoops!THAT SAID.I did enjoy the writing and the ending.And while those things aren't enough to prompt me to rate this thing any higher, I AM going to read the second book.

KNOCKED MY FREAKING SOCKS OFF AND WITH A STORY RE-TELLING?!!!!I hate story re-tellings!!! I hate them but this, this master piece is no Beauty and the Beast. I'm just gonna jump right into everything and just a little warning: I'm so sorry if this seems like I'm frantically flapping around on my keyboard, but I'm just that excited. I was so worried that this book would have a plot too close to Throne of Glass and that the characters would also bare that same fate... But thank the literary gods above that didn't happen. Yes, Maas still gives us swoon worthy gents and a strong leading fem, but they are not at all like the cast of ToG. Our leading lass is Feyre, and man oh man did I love her. I loved that though she is strong she isn't doing it for herself or because that's who she is, she's doing to because it's what needs to be done. This is what made her character for me. She does everything for everyone and expects nothing in return. Her character starts as a strong huntress and turns into something more. She has the head strong will of a warrior and the heart of an artist. I loved that Maas gave her so much depth and let us get so deep into her brain that her feelings become your feelings. As for Feyre's love interested she gives us the heart twist-swoon worthy-deep-thoughtful-man candy that is Tamlin. Oh Tamlin will have you weak in the knees and have your loins aflame (seriously blushed so much during this book). He literately has so much weight on his shoulders and still stands tall. He is willing to give up everything to make sure shes okay. I kid y'all not I never ever use the word \"ship\" for couples, but as they say there's a first for everything and.... I SHIP THEM!!! I SHIP THEM SO HARD! YOU SEE THAT SPOT OVER THERE IN THE DISTANCE THAT IS THEIR SHIP AND IT IS SAILING!!! \n\nCan't stress enough how much I loved their relationship. I love that this book is based around it and its growth. They have such a push and pull. I love that one has everything and one is holding on to anything. How they play off each other is so well written. Also had my brain rocked by how Maas stepped up her sexy game in this book... Because its like a sauna in there! Whoosh so good! *Round of applause* .The sub characters like the rest of the story are so well done. Lucien, Tam's best friend, has got to be one of my favorites in this book. His loyalty won me over. Plus he isn't so bad on the eyes if ya get what I mean... At one point I even remember saying \"I don't know who I like more Teen Wolf or the Sexy Fox with one eye\"... Yeah, Maas makes having one eye even sound hot! The evil Queen in this book was the perfect amount of mystery and you will hate her. And then there's Rhysand... There's not much I'll say about him, but what I will say is that even when Maas gives you characters you're suppose to hate you still end up falling in love with them.\u201cBe glad of your human heart, Feyre. Pity those who don\u2019t feel anything at all.\u201d The plot and world building in this book are so beyond what a lot of other authors would have given us. There are so many vivid details, so many beautifully painted scenes, and so many perfectly peeled layers. I was never once left to question what the world looked like (or characters), and I was thankful for this. Sometimes I do like to fill in the holes with my own ideas but not when it comes to high fantasy reads like this one. The plot is action packed. We have this heavy start to the book, a world building middle, and a jam slammed action packed ending. Because let me tell you when everything comes together and everything is slowly shown you will be tossing your book in the air or punching your kindles in their faces... You will freak out! It's like the end scene to Inception where that heavy DOM DOM music starts playing and the dream is collapsing and everything just falls together for this epic ending! Even the things you know are coming will still rock you to your bones. Maas gives you this heart filled, gut wrenching, wtf ending that I myself couldn't of been happier about. I ate this story up!!!! The plot is just as strong as the characters, and I'm so glad this wasn't a let down. Maas perfectly blends both the YA and NA worlds into this one book. This is a book that will make your heart race and make you want to lose those precise few hours of sleep just to snag a few more chapters... And it'll be worth it too!A Court of Thorns and Roses was the tits.

I loved Tamlin, but I wonder! There were times that Feyre got on my last nerves and I wanted to smack her, but it happens. She did great over all. I loved some of the characters in the book. There is Lucien, who I hope to learn more about in the next book. Alis, who is Feyre's sort of maiden when she comes to the manor. And I actually liked Rhysand in the end. He's a bad guy of sorts but I won't give that spoiler away. I just want more of him! I loved the scenery I pictured in the book from the descriptions. It seems like a beautiful place to live, or is it? There is all sorts of bad stuff going on, bad monsters, curses, killings, you know, the normal stuff!

But sometimes, although you hold dear those innocent depictions of love and courage from childhood memories, your mind desires a new outlook on those tales. Case in point, A Court of Thorns and Roses by the ever-brilliant Sarah J. Maas, manages to dress the wonderful key-elements of Beauty and the Beast into a mesmerizing journey with threads of smart originality, enthralling fantasy and quite sexy times. You cannot imagine my frustration that I couldn't read ACoTaR the second it came out (goddamn you, school) but I'm glad I chose not to fragment it into 20 pages reads so I could devour it now in one sitting. It was SO worth it. *happy dance* I'm not going to explain the plot since I'm late to the party anyway, but I will say this: Beauty and the Beast? Check. Badass, funky and incredibly courageous heroine? Check. Lush settings and well-developed world-building? Cheeeeck. Swoon worthy love interest? Double check. Toe-curling, sigh-inducing and heart-breaking romance? Oh, check. Fae, nightmarish creatures and magic? Check check check. I'm telling you, it had everything a good novel should have and then some! It's SJM after all. \nMeet Feyre, local girl that took a turn down poverty lane when her father lost all the family's fortune and that was bound to a deathbed oath made to her mother about protecting said-father and two elder sisters. She's a huntress and one hunt gone wrong had her trapped forever in the Spring Court of Prythian, the magical land of Fae that completes the universe. \nI unconsciously compared her to Celaena and I realized that they're very different. Feyre surprised me by being colder, not in Celaena's calculated way, but simply in her demeanor and perspective of life. I loved the fact that she found sanctuary in art and I also appreciated the clever ideas which she came up with. There were a couple of times when she acted infuriatingly childish that had me rolling my eyes to the moon and back (Great Rite, anyone?) but, besides those rare occasions, she constantly had my respect for her determination, not to mention her courage that speaks for itself through the obstacles she had to battle in order to obtain her happiness. \nLet's talk boys. Tamlin, Rhysand and Lucien. Don't worry, this time there's no \"harem of men\" like in ToG (not that I'm complaining) -- yet -- but the central piece of the whole book is the love unraveling between Feyre and Tamlin. They're cute and sexy as hell, I'll grant them that. Tamlin is quite the charming, protective alpha-male and he'll win you over pretty easily. I loved the stages of their relationship's evolvement, with awkward stages, fights, lust and a sort of hunger for each other that drives them both, but honestly I never felt really invested in their \"love\". I always saw it more like an infatuation. \nWhich brings me to Rhysand -- basically the epitome of my dark-haired, blue-eyes and dangerous fetish who I couldn't help than fall for thanks to his mysterious allure and sarcastic personality. I loved the fact that him and Feyre are in the early stages of a friendship and, maybe, of a future romance. Regardless of that, Rhys is my newest fictional bae and I wanna find out everything about him. I think I found my replacement for The Darkling! *puts wax figure next to those of Dorian, Will, Alexander, Ash* *pets them all* \nAaand here's the problem actually: if Sarah does indeed decide to develop a love triangle in the next installment, the love on which the events in ACoTaR unfolded won't feel as solid as it's supposed to be. I, personally, would feel deceived. Anyway, it would be interesting to see how it would affect the dynamic between Tam and Rhys, not to mention Tam and Feyre, especially if the mating concept is brought to surface. Oh, the horror!\n\"Be glad of your human heart, Feyre. Pity those who don't feel anything at all.\"\nOh, I almost forgot about Lucien! Didn't entirely love him, but I ended up liking him by the end. However, I was glad he offered some humor, because the other characters barely cracked a joke (and I do love humor, thank you very much). \nFew secondary characters grabbed my attention and I hope that will change, but Alis and Nesta proved to be peculiar and surprising pillars to Feyre's strength. Girl power FTW! Also, I'd love to see something happening between Nesta and Lucien. And one more thing -- Levana should be introduced to the high and mighty bitch of ACoTaR, Amarantha. I have a feeling they'd be BFFs. \nAn aspect that was a real winner was the world-building. I was completely enraptured by the Fae's history, customs and lush settings and I seriously hope they will be further exploited in the next books, because they're a golden mine. Another element I appreciated was the closure this volume offered (finally no cliffhanger!!!) and the few loose ends that will probably make up the plotline for the sequel. As for that, my wish for Sarah to continue the retellings trend in the next books is overwhelming, seeing that the Hades and Persephone myth is a true option. Asdfghjkl the possibilities! \nI have to admit that I had my doubts. Some regarding the utterly horrifying possibility of not liking a SJM book, since it was the first book that had no connection with the Throne of Glass series, and others about it simply not reaching my sky-scraping expectations. But rest assured, Mass killed them all with her badass writing and, naturally, ACoTaR became one of my new all time favorites. Sure, it had its flaws and a certain level of predictability here and there, but if those are the only things that stand in front of an enjoyable reading experience, I am able to overlook them. All in all, I consider this book epically good. Not brilliant and definitely nowhere near the sheer complexity and stakes of the Throne of Glass books, but really good nonetheless. Somehow light and gripping at the same time, with a pace that has you both enjoying every word and anticipating the next thrill, ACoTaR was a magical reprieve from the boring reality, mixing classical and well-known features with amazing and unexpected parts. I loved everything about it and now I'm left counting the days till the sequel, because I'm sure this glorious combination of romance and wickedness was just the tip of the iceberg. What's to come is certainly kickass. \nENJOY! <3"}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "Prepare to see what I felt like during the reading of this book...............................................................\n(The original gif of the fat guy with boobs flopping in slow motion won't load. Thanks GR)This shit reads slowwwwwlyyyyy. Not much happens in the entire first 2/3 of this whole book.You have Feyre who is feeding her dad and her two evil stepsisters. Oh wait, this is Beauty and the Beast not Cinderella. Anyways, her dad is pretty much spineless after losing his money and the two sisters aren't going to stoop to actually feeding themselves so they all three look for the family's youngest to feed them. Feyre. The family is starving so she goes into the dark and scary woods to hunt. She sees a deer! Then a wolf! She kills them both.\nTurns out the wolf is Fae and a big bad guy shows up demanding a life for a life. He takes Feyre to live with him in his lands. He turns from the monster to a fae that has a mask on due to an curse/plague/some shit. I lost interest at this point. I do know you can eat fae food. After all those books that said you can't.\nOf course, there is a curse. I don't want to go spoilery but use your imagination. It is not hard to figure out.\nThen finally we get to some action. Bad evil woman has the land under her spell. Feyre has to save the day by either a riddle or completing three tasks. I like evil woman.\nEvil woman saved the book from a one star just because she was a horny bitch.

Even though, I was aware of what was to come, my heart bled for Feyre. Those scenes that took place Under the Mountain were written ridiculously well and massive props to Queen Maas for captivating and writing about Feyre's struggles, internal dialogue and despair like that.

It will probably only last a book anyway XDORIGINAL REVIEW : February 2016In dedication to my friend Chelsea who saw my rating coming a mile away (you know me way too well), here are little lyrics that show pretty well how I feel about this book in the end : You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,You waste all this time trying to get to me,But you are out of my miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiindI'll probably write a real review later, but for now I shall just run through a few of the explanations for my rating : \u2718 0 star for the BLEH - at best - romance between Mr Golden and Mrs Painter who stays at home because DUH, woman's place, you know. \"No, I don't want you to live somewhere else. I want you here, where I can look after you - where I can come home and know you're here, painting and safe.\"Wonderful. Just wonderful. Before you object - I know, I know, he's kind of right at this point but I still resent the author for making her character deserving this kind of destiny. Icing on the cake, we get to savor marvelous thoughts as, \"it was the happiest moment of my life\" when they kiss. I mean, wow. Way to go, masked pup! You naughty boy. Too bad I didn't feel any chemistry between them.\"He was exactly how I dreamed he would be\" - Oh my GOSH, someone tells me where I can puke.\u2718 0 star for the absolute lack of any plot before the last quarter (and I'm generous) - except if you count living in a castle as a plot. I do, actually. In Harlequin romances. Which are good enough, I guess, when you actually choose to read them and aren't mislead into thinking that you're reading fantasy. Forget the rules, forget the world, and feel the loooooooooove. Not. \u2718 0 star for implying AGAIN that the only reason women choose to fight is for their families. Look, I love my siblings as much as the next person, but I'm getting so fucking tired to see Katniss pale shadows everywhere. If you don't understand why it annoys me, you wouldn't have get why people were pissed last week when the French President reorganized the ministries and blended family, children's rights and women's rights together. Why not add cleaning and cooking, I wonder. See, I loved Katniss, but the pattern is getting old. What it tells us is that men fight because they're warriors, chiefs, or want power, whereas women only do it because they have to. They don't want power. Nah. If they had a say in this, they'd stay at home. That annoys me. While I personally believe that protecting your family is a great cause - of course - I would very much enjoy to see other patterns being used.\u2718 2 stars for Rhysand, because really, he was the only one to wake my interest. What can I say, I'll always prefer cunning to boring instalove. Lucidity to blind puppy love. Wickedness to white knight. If I read the sequel, it will be solely in the hope that somehow Feyre becomes as bad as him. Not that he's that evil. I mean, of course the guy's strikingly beautiful too, because why the fuck not? Harlequin romance, I said! Yet I still owe him my only smiles in this, and his character seems waaaay more appealing than the tamed golden beast. *shrughs*What?

Another book by Sarah J Mass, i wonder what it's about. Surely not about a \"badass\" young girl who falls in love with some jackass, both deny it till the very end. There also can't be any sprinkle of true love or meant to be, or soulmate crap. And there won't be another asshole *cough Rowan* who shows up in the middle of the book, treats our snowflake like shit because secretly he too is in love with her. At the end the snowflake and the jackass breakup for some really dumb reason, that probably doesn't even need to make sense, so Rhys (the asshole) could get with the MC in the next book. They will pretend the first book never even happened, really high chance the snowflake will hate Tamlin (Chaol Westfall) and the asshole will have some really pathetic excuse to be well, an asshole. Sarah might even throw some tortured past and blah blah blah. Oh, don't you worry, if you don't like the asshole or the jackass, there will be a new bitch in the 3rd book, who will be falling head over heels in love with the snowflake. I mean, it's written by Sarah J Mass, so every single man in the story has to be in love with the MC! It's like her only rule.

I honestly only picked it up on audiobook on a whim because I had a long drive this past week, but I was NOT expecting to love it as much as I did!! As someone who wasn't the biggest fan of Throne of Glass, I was nervous to see if I liked it more or if SJM just wasn't for me but I loved everything about this book!! I really loved Feyre, even though sometimes I wanted to yell \"GIRL WHAT ARE YOU DOING\". She's definitely one of my favorite new protagonists that I've read from in a while.

En fin. Este es un de estos libros que me arrepiento de no haber le\u00eddo antes. Lo he disfrutado como llevaba much\u00edsimo tiempo sin disfrutar un libro de fantas\u00eda... De hecho, si echo la vista atr\u00e1s ha pasado mucho tiempo desde la \u00faltima vez que le\u00ed algo de fantas\u00eda de corte m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sico. Y estoy muy contento con haberme reencontrado con el g\u00e9nero.Mucha gente no sabe que Una corte de rosas y espinas es un retelling de La Bella y la Bestia, pero lo es, y me parece que es bastante obvio con algunas referencias. No solo por todo el tema de la maldici\u00f3n, sino por lo que hace que Feyre vaya con Tamlin en primera instancia. No s\u00e9, lo vi bastante claro.Comento esto porque aunque el concepto de retelling sea importante, la novela en s\u00ed es una maravilla. La trama es original y sobre todo lo c\u00f3mo est\u00e1 narrada. Bueno, original no: arriesgada. S\u00ed, m\u00e1s bien esa palabra. La novela es arriesgada. En una \u00e9poca donde las novelas van directas al grano -que no hay NADA de malo en ello- y donde la fantas\u00eda no ten\u00eda un hueco en juvenil (gracias a Maas entre otras ahora s\u00ed lo tiene), creo que Una corte de rosas y espinas le hace un gran favor al g\u00e9nero.No voy a enga\u00f1aros: hubo momentos en los que necesitaba que pasara algo.. Sent\u00eda que Sarah estaba rizando el rizo, metiendo informaci\u00f3n no necesaria, pero por otro lado, lo narraba todo tan bien que no pod\u00eda parar de leer. Ha sido en ese sentido una experiencia rara. Pero en definitiva la cosa queda en que cada palabra est\u00e1 medida, todo tiene sentido y sus significado, y al final ha conseguido emocionarme y dejarme leyendo hasta la \u00faltima frase con el coraz\u00f3n en un pu\u00f1o.Feyre me ha chiflado. Desde la primera p\u00e1gina me pareci\u00f3 un personaje super bien construido, con un mont\u00f3n de matices y unos mon\u00f3logos internos de calidad que consiguen que entendamos perfectamente todas sus dudas y ambiciones. Su vida es dura, y as\u00ed nos lo muestra la autora. Toda la construcci\u00f3n de su entorno, pasado y personajes que le rodean es impecable. Te hace conocerlos de una manera brutal, y de esta manera, entender mejor a Feyre. No s\u00e9, simplemente he conectado bastante con ella y con lo que pensaba. No me ha parecido un estereotipo para nada y sobre todo hacia el final del libro me ha sorprendido con su frialdad e inteligencia. amazingggggTamlin, Lucien, Rhys. A ver, s\u00e9 que Rhys es super mega ultra importante en la saga. Sin embargo, me esperaba algo m\u00e1s de \u00e9l... Lo que he le\u00eddo en esta primera entrega vale, est\u00e1 okay. Nada m\u00e1s. Pero vamos, estoy preparado para que me deje shook en el siguiente libro. Respecto a Lucien y Tamlin me enamor\u00e9 de la din\u00e1mica que ten\u00edan en el castillo de Tam. Sus conversaciones con Feyre eran super entretenidas, llenas de gestos, tonos y miradas que parec\u00eda captar a la perfecci\u00f3n. Es decir: parec\u00eda que estaba ah\u00ed, con ellos, viviendo las conversaciones. Me ha gustado much\u00edsimo la evoluci\u00f3n de Lucien y el personaje de Tamlin, pese a tener sus cosas que no me molan, creo que me va a sorprender en el siguiente libro.Respecto a la creaci\u00f3n del mundo me ha parecido super interesante que hayamos visto tan solo una parte peque\u00f1a de todo lo que es, y aun as\u00ed, seguir desconociendo el mundo de los fae. Todo el concepto de las Cortes separadas por estaciones, D\u00eda, Noche... No s\u00e9, me ha parecido muy interesante. Tengo ganas de ver qu\u00e9 va pasando con ellas y con toda la historia pol\u00edtica que empieza a asomar.La verdad es que no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 m\u00e1s decir. Estoy un poco shook, a decir verdad. Solo me queda decir que lo he disfrutado much\u00edsimo, que estoy enamorado de c\u00f3mo escribe y construye historias Sarah J.
