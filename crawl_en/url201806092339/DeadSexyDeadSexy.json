I was not disappointed. I would describe Dead Sexy as True Blood meets The Walking Dead. A few years ago an infection spread through our land that caused a vast part of the population to fall and rise again. Now the undead are asking for their rights to uh - 'life', liberty, and the right to a fair job.  Gemma Sinclair works for her family's funeral home and hunts rogue zombies on the side. She is fun, feisty, and a fighter. She is forced to team up with Mr. 'Hottie McNoPulse', an agent from the Department of Undead Americans, to try and find out why undead Americans are going missing. Unfortunately, DS Thomas Conroy has her pulse racing in more ways than one. To Gemma the initials DS only stand for one thing - Dead Sexy. He is smart, has an intriguing history, and doesn't like to be pushed around.  I received an ARC of this story in exchange for a review. I would have given one anyway as I loved this book and can't wait for the next. I really enjoyed the secondary characters as well. I am looking forward to finding out more about DS, Gemma, and her mother in the next books."}, {"userName": "\u2606Joycedale\u2606", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22352915-joycedale", "userReview": "I love this story. At first I thought I was a little bias because I mostly love anything zombie but then I realized that's not it. It is funny, sexy, and had a great plot (plus there is the zombie).From the beginning I liked Gemma and D.S. She's a buttkicking hunter and he's an undead agent for the goverment. He's a hottie flirt and she's confused about being turned on by a zombie.They meet when Gemma stun guns him not knowing he's an agent. He asks for her help in an investigation in her city of Detroit.I love their relationship. The back and forth insults and flirting are funny and great.The storyline is good too, I would never had guessed who the guy they was searching for was. What happened at the end I did see coming but he also hinted at it a few times.It doesn't end in a cliffhanger but there is unanswered questions.One thing that I don't think will be addressed and its just driving me nuts is why D.S. grabbed Gemma from behind when he got to her funeral home? Did he not realize that of course she would attack.I'm anxiously awaiting Dead Set.I was given an eArc by the author in exchange for a honest review.

It was really inconsistent, first she mentions Biters can't vote but later states that they need their undead ID to register to vote, she refers to biters driving round the city and than later states they can't drive as their reflexes are impaired by necrosis, there's also some to-ing and fro-ing about Biters sense of smell and a couple of other things, it's irritating that the author can't seem to remember her own rules.It also bugged me that Gemma keeps telling us how she kicks ass and takes names. Seriously, she says this about herself at least three times . . . Apart from all of this - and the thing about the romantic interest being dead (creepy whichever way you paint it), I liked this book. It was funny, the dialogue was snappy and the whole book was a little Ilona Andrews-esque. Not sure if I'll read more of this series, I'm not certain I can get passed the dead people walking (I like my Zombies to be mindless and monstrous and in need of killing), but if I do it won't be straight away. I'd probably read something else by the author though."}, {"userName": "Randi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7786543-randi", "userReview": "When I first heard about Dead Sexy by Aleah Barley I was intrigued and eager to read it, so when I got the chance to read an ARC from the publisher in exchange for a review, I jumped at it.After reading this story, I\u2019m so glad that I did, because it was wonderful. This was my first Zombie book. I\u2019ve seen many a Zombie movie and TV show, and I have been a fan of the paranormal genre for years, but had yet to read a book about Zombies. Now, after reading this book I cannot wait to read the next one.The main character Gemma is the kind of girl that every girl really wants to be, she\u2019s tough and funny and pretty in that way that she doesn\u2019t see it herself, and she can kick Biter butt with the best of them.Then D.S. comes along and starts to change her views on what and who Zombies and really be. He\u2019s unexpected in the best way possible and the kind of guy that every girl wants to be with.This book was fast paced and never let up and left me wanting the next book, in this sure to be phenomenal series, right now! This was the first book I have read from this author, but it will not be the last, not by a long shot.I give it a 5 out of 5 stars because that\u2019s the highest it lets you go. :)"}, {"userName": "E.F.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7351037-e-f", "userReview": "I received an ARC of Dead Sexy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review!Upon receiving this book I couldn't wait to dive into it. The topic of zombies have always been intriguing to me and I love all of the unique books that are coming out. Dead Sexy is an amazing read and had me hooked right from the start. It's funny, it's sexy, and I just couldn't get enough! The main character, Gemma Sinclair, is mouthy, feisty, courageous, and bighearted - exactly what I love in a heroine! Then you go and add in the mysterious and sexy D.S. - I am in love! The story-line is wonderfully unique and the author has a way of writing that, whether you are a fan of zombies or not, you will have have trouble putting this down. Take it from me . . . within four hours of reading the first chapter I found myself finished and eagerly looking online for information on the next book in this series! I highly recommend this book to everyone! This is definitely a series I will be keeping an eye on!"}, {"userName": "Tom Leeland", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16745586-tom-leeland", "userReview": "Excellent fast read. Excellent story flow. Excellent character builds. This story had a very well thought out balance of mystery, action, suspense and well fleshed out intimate scenes. The main character is a female, independent, self reliant, witty and strong. Her love interest is a sexy man who is more then just a man, he has a personality that I wasn't expecting given what I know about the story. I was given the opportunity to read this story as a beta version and I missed a fair amount of details due to the many distractions I get. I'm glad I reread the released edition from start to finish in under two days. If your reading this review and you like urban fantasy then this book is for you. Yes there are zombies, yes there are rotten humans and yes there are normal decent people that make up this urban fantasy and if you like all that with some extra \"spices\" wink wink thrown in then pick this book up. Also I cant wait for book two book this ending was delicious and I want more."}, {"userName": "Jeff Babineaux", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34281726-jeff-babineaux", "userReview": "I received an advance reader copy of Aleah Barley's Dead Sexy. The novel is so much like it's male lead, D.S. It's funny, sexy, charming, and rough around the edges. It's a hell of a ride, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys Janet Evanovich's butt-kicking bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. Gemma is a girl with her head screwed on straight, except when her hormones get the best of her from the smoking-hot D.S. She kicks butt and takes names. Her family is a hoot (with a stark contrast from her straight laced mother to her biter uncle). The plot and the world that she's crafted is smart and wicked fun. There were a few rough patches, but they won't keep me from buying a copy for myself when the book hits shelves later this week."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Austin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19340210-rebecca-austin", "userReview": "What a great book!! This was the first time I have read a book by Aleah Barley and it will definitely not be my last! The book is set in Detroit in a time with Biters, Zombies and Humans all living together but in a time that is not harmonious. Gemma Sinclair works for her family's mortuary but also takes side jobs catching Biters. While on a job she meets the mysterious D.S. and sparks and tension fly! The two work together to find out why Biters have been disappearing from Detroit.Gemma is tough and gets herself into many situations where it shows her limits - which I like!I urge you to give the book a try!

I love zombies, but do not normally read paranormal anything. This tale might have converted me. The idea of humans and the undead living side by side intrigues me and the fact that they would demand rights, great idea! Aleah\u2019s characters are strongly written and her plots are quite innovative.Gemma is a strongly written character, feisty with the ability to kick rogue zombie ass. Our hero, undead, but is pulse poundingly sexy, with an interesting past. Just enough history to cause our heroine to rethink what she thought she knew.

The \"bad guy\" was obvious before the end of the story, but the many threads of who was a monster and who wasn't really kept my interest.
