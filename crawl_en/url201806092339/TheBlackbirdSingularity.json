The doctors prescribed lithium, but Vince stopped taking his medication after learning of his wife's unexpected pregnancy. Withdrawal kicks in, and Vince's hold on reality spirals into chaos. Now he's seeing Charlie in the hallway, sensing him in the attic, hearing his laughter in the dark . . . The Blackbird Singularity opens with a few novice writing techniques, but it's worth pushing through the initial pages to explore this book in its entirety. Once the book finds its stride, the story unfolds to reveal an engaging account of one man's struggle to grieve the death of his son and cling to a crumbling sense of what is real and what is not. Vince makes for a compelling protagonist. He's a well-intentioned husband and father, though his actions sometimes suggest otherwise. As a writer, he's both reverent and dedicated to his craft. And he's self aware of the degree to which his mental wanderings favor morbidity; he's always cautious to avoid being indelicate toward others where his ghoulish thoughts are concerned. Walking on, I recall my obsession with Charlie's decomposition. For months, rolling around in bed, I would find myself imagining the state of his dead body in its coffin. Again and again I wished he'd been cremated but was too scared to share this with Lyd. Not only because I had been too manic and too far gone to attend the funeral (or even conceive of it) but because I didn't want to bring a new unimagined kind of torment on her. There was a chance she hadn't thought of his body rotting and decaying in its coffin.As Vince's mind unravels, subsequent to his withdrawal from lithium, his world becomes stranger and more eerie. He ultimately reaches a lurid state described through visualizations with abstract qualities. My contemplation is broken by the absence of solitude. There's something behind me. Eyes are on me. I know it's Charlie but I don't want to look. My heart is racing. My hands tingle and begin to sweat. I can feel his smile in the air around me. Almost hear his giggle. [The blackbird] jumps and turns one hundred and eighty degrees and all the foliage behind him blurs and turns into a gold-and-green blur. He jumps and turns one hundred and eighty degrees again and I see faces everywhere, evil green faces made out of leaves, flat, monstrous, screaming in agony. Every chapter opens with a paragraph detailing something of a scientific nature. These interludes are always fascinating and well-crafted for optimum intrigue. Birds see a whole field of visual information that is beyond human comprehension. People can try to guess what it is by studying the behaviors and attributes of birds (some experts say polarized light, others magnetic fields) but in the end they have to accept the limitations of the imagination and admit that birds can see an entire dimension that people are unable to envision. With its heightened gleam and consistent position, Polaris almost certainly instigated the earliest discoveries of astronomy but it no doubt also helped to elongate the belief that humanity was at the center of an orchestrated cosmological plan. After all, it is much more probably that the night sky's point of true north would be black, not the brightest star in the sky. The Blackbird Singularity is an unusual book that offers a captivating portrayal of mental illness. --Special thanks to Matt Wilven and Goodreads for a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Joanne Harris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34428697-joanne-harris", "userReview": "The moving, surreal journey of a writer in deep depression following the death of his son, through the turmoil of his partner\u2019s new pregnancy and the mystical relationship he forms with a wild blackbird in his back garden. It\u2019s a well-written, atmospheric little novel, with a cast of rather too many characters \u2013 though by far the best and most convincing sections are the ones that deal with the narrator\u2019s struggle with grief and his battle with depression and drugs. By contrast, the other characters seemed a little flat, especially the women, none of whom appear to have much personality, in spite of the frequent, detailed descriptions of their appearance and clothing. On the whole, though, an excellent portrayal of mental illness, with a message of hope and rebirth to mitigate the darkness."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14810944-lesley", "userReview": "This book is exquisite! Wilvern cleverly blends the dimensions of science, mathematics, psychology, philosophy, anthropology and mythology with the inner world of a man who was literally turned mad with grief. We walk vicariously into the protagonist's decline into insanity - Vince, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after the death of his son. Two years later, Vince abruptly stops taking his lithium on hearing the news that his wife is pregnant again, and we follow him, even collude with him, as Wilvern has us buying into his manic reasoning one minute before turning a sharp corner into the frightening reality of Vince's delusions. But what is reality? Wilvern intelligently, subtly, asks this question by describing various theories of reality and existence, in particular by describing the concept of 'singularity' in mathematics, mechanics and physics to parallel Vince's apparent decline. The blackbird singularity is a proposal for a new dimension, which we witness in Vince's thought life as he attributes words to the blackbird Blackie who visits his garden, projecting his own beliefs, fears, hopes, despair, delusions, and meaning onto its chirps and song, which he sees and hears everywhere he goes in increasing measure and intensity; and to his other hallucinations, including his dead son. The blackbird singularity is a proposal of a new or alternative concept of reality.Don't be put off by all the mention of science above, if you're not into science this should not detract from your reading experience, because it is subtle, it so intelligently done, and I mention it in this review because I absolutely loved it. The truth is, this novel has so many dimensions to it that are clever, humourous, sad, and very intense, full of parallels and contradictions that are mixed and juxtaposed flawlessly. It is full of alarming suspense as you follow Vince's thoughts towards a seemingly inevitable train wreck that you both fear and enjoy, unable to tear your eyes from. There are some great moments with the other characters in the book where you are left wondering who is more mad or unstable. One of my particular favourites was a small throwaway line about his wife's pregnancy cravings for worms and twigs. But I don't believe there is anything 'throwaway' about Matt Wilven's writing at all.Ultimately this is a tale about about life and death, and about grief; how chemistry failed Vince's need to grieve properly for the death of his son; how science let him down by heavily medicating him so he was only a shadow of himself; and how he finds himself again in his journey into madness. This is the best novel I have read in a long time.I received this novel to read from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Petra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28393395-petra", "userReview": "[the birth (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27246754-sarah", "userReview": "The Blackbird Singularity is probably not my obvious choice of book but after reading the description there was just something about it that really appealed to me.Vince and his wife are still trying to come to terms with the loss of their son Charlie. It is so hard to comprehend what a parent must go through in losing a child. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s grief is the same and everyone handles it differently. Vince obviously has had a total break down and has been put on Lithium so he can cope with life. The only problem is, is that the medication leaves him feeling fuzzy and not like he is really living so he makes the decision to come off them without telling anyone.The relationship between Vince and his wife is very fragile with each of them trying their best to cope in their own way. Due to Vince\u2019s break down and his very slow work as an author, it is very much left to his wife to be the bread winner as well as try and keep everything all together.The story has quite a few characters who are all very interesting, especially Vince\u2019s friend Jamal. Jamal reminds me of some sort of guru that has the answers to the universe. He is a sense of clarity in Vince\u2019s otherwise mixed up world.A lot of what Vince is experiencing I think is down to the effects of the withdrawal of the Lithium. The parts where he sees his son were very moving and I also loved the parts with the blackbird. It very much felt like there is this mist that is quite dark and dense to start with which starts to clear the further into the story we got.The Blackbird Singularity is a beautifully written story dealing with loss, relationships and fighting your way back up to the surface of life again. It is moving and meaningful and one that will stay with me for a long time to come.My thanks to Lucy at Legend Press for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Megalion", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14853675-megalion", "userReview": "This is one of those times where I can't relate enough to the characters or situation to engage with the book. I have no kids so I've never even contemplated the pain of losing one. However, usually I can find a way to empathize.This time, I simply can't. Vince is bipolar. As am I. But I can't relate to his experience because in my opinion, he's making stupid decisions. Yet at the same time, I'm all too aware that the psychological ramifications of being bipolar is caused by physiology. In other words, our brain chemistry is jacked and messing with our minds. Not unlike a brain tumor only ours is incurable. Meds only go so far and it requires committment on the part of the individual to stay on them. Catch 22: stability often comes at a cost of joie de vivre and/or clear thinking. Is it worth being numb?Vince's story lets the reader in on what it's like inside the mind of one bipolar person. Emphasis on one. There's a wide spectrum of how people are affected both by the condition and how we respond to meds. Back to the loss of a child, this is the traumatic instance that blew Vince out of the water and triggered the latent bipolar in him. His wife is also struggling and while couples often struggle to stay together in their mutual grief, Vince's condition makes it even harder. This isn't a bad story. It's a your mileage may vary situation and I suspect it'll be a 4 star read for many folks. I'm giving it a 3 even though I've decided to let go of the story at just past 50%.

He is prescribed lithium but decides to come off it as he finds his real personality is clouded by the drug and he wants to be in full command of his intellect. But his sudden withdrawal from the drug has unexpected consequences and we follow Vince\u2019s struggle as he tries to cope with his mental state. As his world begins to spiral out of control he finds connection with a blackbird in his garden, and whether as metaphor or simply a sign of Vince\u2019s instability, it\u2019s a haunting image. As the novel progresses it remain unclear whether Vince will ever reconcile with what\u2019s happened and the tension is expertly maintained until the bitter end. I did have a real problem with an incident at the end of the novel, which I can\u2019t talk about here without revealing too much, as at a key moment I was left in doubt about exactly what was happening, but that apart I found myself completely drawn into the narrative. The characterisation is very good indeed, with even minor characters coming alive with a few deft strokes, and the dialogue is authentic and convincing. It\u2019s a well-paced and well-plotted piece of writing, a moving tale of loss, bereavement, madness and ultimately redemption through love, which explores with empathy and delicacy issues of mental health.

It's blatantly surreal, if you will.

He\u2019s an ordinary guy with a creative intelligence, which is being suffocated by the Lithium coursing through his veins. He relies on the drug to see him through to the next day, well this, and the immense strength of his wife, Lydia.His behaviour is erratic and he\u2019s missing out on what\u2019s left of his life since the tragic death of his young son pushed him into a dark, dark corner. With his writing career non-existent, incapable of holding down a paying day job, he\u2019s financially supported by Lydia much to the disapproval of her family. In their eyes this waster locust who feeds of her good will has sunk lower than they could have ever thought.As he discovers he and Lydia are to be parents again, there\u2019s a pivotal point in Vince\u2019s thinking. He stops taking the Lithium. He doesn\u2019t tell anyone, as this is Vince staking a claim on himself once again. The withdrawal results in manic episodes that are blooming with clarity followed by hallucinations tapping into his sub conscious. Scary as this is, life becomes so vivid he is able to write again. But this liberation entwines with confusion when Blackbirds begin to visit his garden. Vince strikes an affinity with one fearless chappie who defies convention to cautiously investigate this strange man standing on the patio in his pj\u2019s clutching a bag of raisins.Their worlds become linked by something I could only describe as deeply spiritual, and Vince begins to look for meaningful signs from his feathered friend. The relationship could be a cathartic experience or may just give him a reason to get up every morning. By concentrating his efforts on getting well without clouding his judgement with his medication, he misses the most vital sign of all \u2013 Lydia is drifting further away.It\u2019s painful to see how a tragic circumstance eroded what they once shared. Charlie, their son, is not openly discussed after Vince\u2019s breakdown but it\u2019s clear that they both can't accept that he's not coming back.The story is told in three \u2018trimesters\u2019 that cleverly correlate with the pregnancy and Vince\u2019s own growth during it. There are some thought-provoking introductions to every new chapter on philosophical topics such as time, space and theories that tie in nicely with the current state of his writerly mind. I could only imagine the profound conversations he once must have had with Lydia as this is her area of expertise. I also looked forward to the rare visits Vince made to his hoarder friend's house. Jamal possesses a quirky and relaxed nature which is complimented by humble wisdom; while he smokes a joint he can rattle off his knowledge about all things deep and meaningful when the need arises.The Blackbird Singularity is a brave and powerful book. I found the weight of Vince\u2019s distress strangely hypnotic and couldn\u2019t stop myself being drawn into the isolated world he found himself living in. It lays bare the spectrum of grief while offering a chink of light at the light at the end of a very dark tunnel.(I received a copy of this title from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review, with my thanks.)"}, {"userName": "Wael EL Gabas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28048760-wael-el-gabas", "userReview": "Unique, Masterpiece, one of the kind, it is a very unique experience to read this book, too many emotions, too many thoughts you got when you read, very grasping, very original and super unique, i think it is the birth of a new star in literature Matt Wilven."}, {"userName": "Writerful Books", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10299264-writerful-books", "userReview": "The Blackbird Singularity explores the fine line between a writer\u2019s creativity and a mind in the grip of a full-blown manic episode.

This was not the case.The Blackbird Singularity is a careful, nuanced exploration of a tumultuous mind before, during, and after a breakdown. The lines between reality and unreality are blurred, but not in a stereotypical~I'm gOiNG cRAaAzY!~ way, if you know what I mean. Vince constantly checks and questions his perception of the world and his understanding of what happens. There are things that he sees that he's aware aren't real, and other visions that he easily accepts as real that may not be. Wilven managed that tricky art of showing the wariness or outright hostility that can build in the people surrounding somebody with a mental illness without allowing those opinions to overwhelm the narrative. This means that you can feel their uneasiness and disapproval without also feeling that you're supposed to disapprove. There is no condemnation of mental illness, there is no suggestion that it is a gift as some stories tend to do, there are no broad statements about recovery or what it means to experience a breakdown or a manic period. There's just Vince and his specific experience with all its highs and lows.I found parts of this books read like a psychological thriller, I think due to the pacing. It was tense, dramatic without being over the top, and quietly heart breaking to experience Vince's anxieties along with him.While the conversations between characters were intelligent and thoughtful, and often important to the plot, they sometimes wandered into that over the top John Green style territory where it was hard to believe that two people would regularly speak to each other in such a way.I also found the ending extremely bizarre and dissatisfying.

It reminded me of my mother and her favourite blackbird that she used to feed.However, things for Vince are a lot more complicated than just feeding the local birds like a caring birdwatcher. Vince has just stopped taking his lithium, he's haunted by the ghost of their first child and Lyd, his physicist partner is pregnant again.This is a brilliant book, totally engrossing, a roller coaster ride of emotions that never veers out of the author's control (though it is clear that Vince is losing control of his life....). I particularly love the descriptions of Vince's relationship with the blackbirds:\"I slide the patio door shut and pull a chair away from the kitchen table, wrap my hands around a cup of coffee and watch the white lawn. Within seconds a blackbird arrives and then another. Soon there are nearly a dozen of them fluttering about, raising tiny clouds of hoar frost and trying to win a few moments on top of one of the sultana clumps. I'm not sure how long I sit watching them, but for the first time in a long time, I experience thecreative glimmer of a new idea.After a couple of minutes the idea is outshining my interest in the birds so I venture upstairs to my writing desk.\"Mental health, grief, paranoia, dysfunctional families and barely functional friendships plus nature make for a wonderful mix in Wilven's debut novel.

This decision allows him to forge ahead with his creative writing and to feel things more vividly than before, but it also causes problems with his marriage and other areas of his life. There are times when you're not sure if what you're reading is real or part of Vince's delusions.

I felt that his rejection of medication was believable, and that the withdrawal symptoms were realistic and well-integrated.

The first chapter of this book was amazing. It was chillingly gripping with the death of a child, drugs, depression and the dread/joy of a new baby on the way and how those devastated by death can bring a new life into the shadowed world.I feel very sorry for Vince as he dealing with lithium withdrawal, his son\u2019s death, a new baby and most of all there seems to be no intimacy between him and Lyd. Most of her family are under the impression now she is pregnant again she is stuck with him, when we know he is trying his best to become the best dad, best man he can be before the baby arrives. Although he is deceiving his wife by now taking lithium for his mania which was a strict condition she set in place for taking him back after Charlie\u2019s death, I still feel he has a good heart after all the road to hell is paved with good intentions.We being to see that Lyd wants so desperately to hold on to the past, to Charlie and everything that is happening in the present is disrupting that whereas Vince wants to move forward to put the past where it belongs and in their own ways they are slowly falling apart, the question is can they be put back together or at least hold on long enough for their new baby.Vince is trying to change aspects of his life, like getting closer to his mother and to Lydia, but he unconsciously developed a sort of friendship with a blackbird who he feels is special, but it is at this time he begins to hear noises in the attic above Charlie\u2019s room and he is constantly reminding himself of the symptoms of mania so he can hide them from those he loves around him especially Lydia because she would leave him if she found out he stopped taking his medication.The way the book is writing it is like we are inside Vince\u2019s head throughout his struggles, trials and the little moments of joy he finds in the cracks of his life. As I am reading through this novel I am finding it hard to process all Vince\u2019s emotion as they ebb and flow in rapid bursts.By the time we get to the second trimester Vince is starting to feel more like himself but in doing so he realises how distant Lydia has become especially with the pregnancy, and how haunted he feels by his son\u2019s death and packing up his room and redecorating doesn\u2019t seem to shake this feeling.I loved how Vince seems to always end up in the wrong place at the wrong time especially when people are concerned. But I am also really concerned for him given his history having a new baby on the way, watching his best friend\u2019s marriage fall apart due to affairs, second guessing himself on whether he actually wants the new baby, I feel sooner or later without his medication he is going to go over the edge.The blackbirds seem to mirror children in this novel, as Lydia and Vince both beginning hearing things, footsteps and laughter that belongs to Charlie, they begin to unravel although both try and hide it from the other. At the halfway point in the novel I am filling with so many emotions I can\u2019t place or begin to understand. As Lydia comes round the idea of a new child Vince starts getting cold feet, it like they have be opposites if he wants it she doesn\u2019t and vice versa, although neither can forget the nagging thoughts of Charlie at the back of their minds like a betrayal that they don\u2019t even know they have committed.After this Vince\u2019s life takes a major nosedive his book gets dropped and he has to repay his advance, Lydia found out he stopped taking his medication and she is leaving, we don\u2019t know if it is for good but we do know his life has just fallen apart around him. As Vince spirals further into depression and withdrawal he begins to hallucinations of Charlie all the while drawing himself further and further away from Lydia and the baby.In this last trimester of this novel Vince seems to be getting more drawn into his mania but also feeling like he is getting better at the same time, while to everyone else like Jamal, Lydia and Peter he is falling back into the same patterns of behaviour he had just after Charlie died. And during all this craziness he is trying to salvage his relationship, find himself and become a suitable father.The last 70 pages of this novel were astounding. Vince and Lydia get back together before the unusual birth of their daughter. And in the end Matt Wilven doesn\u2019t leave us a happy ending but he certainly leaves an opening to one. This means that after the ending the characters could be happy or they could relapse into the spirals and voids of depression they have always known, and it is something we won\u2019t know the answer to but I\u2019m completely ok with this.I was left with so many feelings at the end of this book, they were good mostly but some slightly bad but overall Matt Wilven has written an astoundingly beautiful novel with some of the best writing I have seen in a long time.

Matt Wilven brings beautifully written metaphors that leave you breathless. Each word fits in so perfectly to these metaphors and truly brings to life the meaning behind it that you can\u2019t help but wonder how something has never been described this way before. Wilven brings an alternate perspective on Charlie\u2019s cancer that flows and highlights the internal struggle with such an illness that many would find hard to imagine.The Blackbird Singularity is a work of contemporary fiction following the decline and rise of Vince Watergate. Following the untimely death of their first born son, Vince can no longer cope; he breaks out into peals of laughter, he squanders away a lifetime of savings and, after some time in a psychiatric ward, is prescribed a lifetime of lithium to help him to cope with his loss. This novel is about Vince and his attempts to rid himself of the fuzz of the lithium, to become who he used to be and to find himself in amongst the mess that has become his marriage, his job, and his whole life. We are presented with moments of grief, lies, family division, insecurity, issues of trust, and a sense of clarity.I found this novel to be very eye-opening, providing a realistic and truthful view into the lives of those suffering from mental health. Though I cannot in any way relate to those that may have experienced events such as those by Vince and Lyd, Wilven doesn\u2019t hold back in showing the extremities to which Vince\u2019s mind will go to blur the boundaries between imagination and reality thus showcasing the extent to which Vince believes in the truth of what he sees before him. I felt a lot of sympathy towards Vince during these moments fully understanding him and his mind during his times of struggle and uncertainty; his mind presenting visuals of comfort and also disturbance and fear depending on events taking place or to come.Wilven\u2019s character\u2019s and the relationships between them holds true to the realism of this novel and shows the varying opinions of people towards mental health and those suffering and trying to cope with events happening around them. Many of Vince\u2019s interactions with other characters result in feelings of confusion and puzzlement as well as skepticism towards how he is handling his life and coping with matters. We begin to see issues of family division and insecurity as Lyd\u2019s family question his hold on reality and ostracize him as things begin to get worse. However, there are some characters that accept Vince for who he is such as Jamal, the joint-smoking auto-mechanic who has a more relaxed outlook on life and believes that Vince can overcome whatever is troubling him. It is interesting to see all these character\u2019s from different walks of life and the impact they have on Vince as well as how they perceive him.The character of Vince goes through a lengthy process in order to develop into the character he is at the end of the novel. Facing bouts of insanity and delusions, being confronted with the truth about his writing career, and journeying through a marriage where both people are on different sides of the fence makes for a lot when it comes to Vince. Though he does fall a couple of times (literally and figuratively), he pulls himself back up and never stops trying to become the best person that he can be. He is constantly trying to impress Lyd and reassure her that he is fine, that he can handle not being on the lithium and all of this makes for a relatable setting in regards to marriage. We see scenes of arguments and disagreements, moments of love and comfort. The dialogue between the two flows and runs like a real conversation between a married couple and brings these characters to life.This novel is truly beautiful and brings a lot of insight to the issues surrounding mental health and illness, family and marriage. It is a realistic approach that allows the reader to identify with the characters and understand their experiences as well as the lengthy process that is undertaken in order for Vince to become a better person, or as close to the person as he was before. It is a novel that I would recommend for anyone interested in mental health and brings coverage to a topic that needs to be focused on in order for people to truly understand those that are suffering."}, {"userName": "Sharon Bhamra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50208010-sharon-bhamra", "userReview": "Matt Wilven\u2019s The Blackbird Singularity is an intense and deep exploration of mental illness and grief. After the death of his son Charlie, Vince spirals into mania with only the help of lithium to control and bring him back to reality. When finding out his wife Lyd, is pregnant, he stops taking his medication and what follows is an honest depiction of someone experiencing withdrawal and how it affects everyone around them. The book addresses loss; not just in the form of bereavement but also in the form of losing yourself. The most exquisite aspect of this novel is the subtle integration of science and mathematics, in particular the various theories of reality and the concept of singularity which corresponds to Vince\u2019s decline. As his descent into mania begins to unravel, he befriends a blackbird who communicates messages to him about his life and events that will occur in the future. Wilven realistically portrays the diverse opinions of people towards mental health and those suffering and trying to cope with the events surrounding them. Many of Vince\u2019s interactions with other characters result in feelings of confusion and cynicism towards his chosen method of coping with his life. Vince goes through an extensive process in order to develop into the person he becomes at the end of the novel; from facing delusions to being confronted with the truth about his career and being in a marriage where both people don\u2019t see eye to eye on certain things. The most commendable trait that Vince has is that always he never stops trying to become the best person that he can be. He is constantly trying to impress Lyd and reassures her that he doesn\u2019t need the lithium anymore. Wilven portrays them as a real married couple where they argue but have those moments of love and comfort. The dialogue between the two runs like a genuine conversation between a married couple and which brings these characters to life.The Blackbird Singularity is a poignant and powerful novel. Though it is heart-rending, you can\u2019t help but feel uplifted towards the end. Wilven writes with such depth and beauty that you can\u2019t help but be drawn into Vince\u2019s journey."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32401527-michael", "userReview": "No parent copes well with the death, unexpected or otherwise, of a child. Some are only better than others at hiding their hurt. Vince reacts in an extreme way, loses his mind and in the process almost ruins the family financially \u2013 and for this is hospitalised, medicated and only allowed home when he promises to keep taking the medicine which almost makes him catatonic. A promise he breaks.Lyd doesn't lose it. She suffers as much as he does but added to that resents the fact that she had to deal with all the arrangements after the death on her own, Vince being mentally and physically in a different world. She also resents the fact that she has become the bread winner and not only keeps them both alive, housed and fed bit also has to pay off the debt he incurred in his mad spending spree.But Vince doesn't think he's insane. Yes, he talks to a blackbird. Yes, he sees his son in different locations. But this is only his way of coping. Lyd hits the bottle from time to time, he has delusions, hallucinations, fantasies.With such conflicts it's inevitable that they separate \u2013 temporarily or forever is uncertain. Vince resents it, he sees it as desertion but Lyd sees it the only way to keep her sanity. Whist bemoaning the loneliness that comes with the empty house it allows Vince to write again, and this time he really thinks he has something to say and something others will want to read.On top of their own problems their best friends are going through a bit of a crisis and selfishly pass on their problems to people who already have enough of their own. When a crisis arises in a person's life the problems of others are forgotten.And Lyd is pregnant. It is during the three trimesters of her pregnancy that all the action takes place.It works, or certainly the majority of the story did for me. You can feel the pain of the bereaved parents, you can understand that in such circumstances the way each deals with their loss can seem to be over the top. But we should always remember 'there but for the grace of' before becoming hypercritical. Where I did get lost \u2013 felt alienated from the story and with episodes that I thought just came from nowhere \u2013 was the surreal telling of the some of circumstances surrounding the pre-natal period and then the birth of the new child. Perhaps Wilven thought the reader needed some 'light relief' from the despair of what had gone before. To me it just felt tacked on and didn't develop the story in any way.If the arrival of a new baby was what was needed to kick them both out of their unhappiness and desolation following the death of the first born I didn't see why we needed such an injection of 'humour'."}, {"userName": "Kate Avery", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56594686-kate-avery", "userReview": "Here, I\u2019m not just a lost and hopeless man...I\u2019m in a safe place, fighting to get through a dark time, taking an isolated opportunity to try to come to terms with some of the blind spots in my mind.\nThe Blackbird Singularity is a book about loss, not just in the sense of bereavement but also losing yourself. After his son dies, Vince spirals into a black hole that he only manages to surface from with the help of lithium. However the lithium makes him cloudy and when he finds out his wife, Lyd, is going to have a baby, he decides to stop taking them. What follows is an uncannily honest view of how someone experiences withdrawal and how those around them react to it. The way the book moves through the stages of withdrawal, as he deals with his grief, draws you in and makes you feel as if you are going through it with him, finding logic in seemingly deranged situations. The brilliant thing about this book is how the rest of Vince\u2019s family and friends act around him, the way they set him apart and treat him, is a very realistic look at how our reactions to people with mental health issues isolates them. A comment on how people strive to be accepting but that there are always limits. Another exceptional aspect is the juxtaposition of Vince being the one diagnosed with a mental condition, but yet it is his friends that are behaving as if they have lost their senses. For me this highlighted the fact that we as humans all have maniacal moments, and that there are only a few degrees separating what\u2019s considered normal and what is considered unbalanced. The way these qualities have been written made the characters entirely genuine, the way they react to the situations they find themselves in and to those around them, it is as if you are looking at a snapshot of human life.There was only one moment in the book that I felt suddenly unconnected. It was possibly just my perception; however there was a point where I thought Vince was beginning to overcome the withdrawal and then recedes in a way that felt very unrealistic. Although this could be an observation on how extreme circumstances can make these issues flair up at any stage, it did make me take a step out of the story.The way the book mixes such a heavy topic with a myriad of other subjects and elements such as humour, philosophy, psychology, science and an almost light-hearted look at the human condition made it a pleasure to read.Thanks to Legend Press and Netgalley for the review copy of this book.https://everywhereandnowhereblog.word..."}], "description": "Vince stops taking his lithium when he finds out about his partner's pregnancy.
