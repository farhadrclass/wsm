And I was not disappointed. This volume brought back so many memories of the show for me and reminded me of just how much I loved it\u2014 even with the jump scares. \nBut The Walking Dead doesn\u2019t only focus on the gore of killing zombies, it also explores how people deal with extreme situations and how these events CHANGE them.It was certainly interesting looking back at how Rick started on his journey and how much he has changed and matured since. But a lot of beloved old characters reappeared:(GLENN!! CAROL!! ANDREA!! )\nOh, and Shane also appeared which reminded me of how much I  despised  him (always a fun reminder).\nBut then Carl shot him, which astonished me, considering that in the tv show it doesn\u2019t happen till much later.\nAnd I don\u2019t remember a Donna from the tv show, but I wholeheartedly agreed with what she brought up:\n(I did not like Lori in this story. At all.)And I almost forgot how gruesome some scenes can be in The Walking Dead, especially when they went on the hunt for guns in Atlanta:(I had to take a breather after that part.)\nBut it was interesting seeing how different the pace is compared to the tv show\u2014that\u2019s mainly why I quit after season 5, the pace was too damn slow.And yet this kind of made me want to continue watching the show?? But if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll still continue on to volume 2 in this series (I hope sooner rather than later).*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

You can see by the ratings and the other reviews of this book that a lot of people think very highly of this series and it is certainly justified. This is the kind of excellence in both writing and art that make the graphic novel an incredibly power medium when it is done well. Here\u2026.it is done very well indeed. The writing and the art are superb and I don\u2019t think you could ask for better.Basically, the set up is very familiar. It is a zombie apocalypse, society has broken down and the walking dead control the cities with bands of humans living in the outskirts trying to survive. I think that is enough background for you to understand the basic premise of the series. \nTherefore, rather then do a detailed plot synopsis which others have done very well, I thought I would mention 3 things (beyond the aforementioned writing and art) that I really thought set this series apart from your typical zombie/undead apocalypse story.  1. The Realism The creators of this story have started with an impossible, unbelievable premise and yet from there have done their best to make the reader forget that we are dealing with science ficiton. They have imbued the story with a very realistic tone and the actions and inactions of the characters in the story felt authentic.  2. The Story\u2019s Focus/PacingWhile the zombie\u2019s in this story are very important and provide a great \u201cdanger\u201d this story really focuses on the lives of the survivors and how the breakdown of society can affect people differently. The character development is excellent and the emotional resonance is stronger than you typically see in this kind of story.  3. The ZombiesOne thing that really struck me while I was reading this is that I found myself feeling sorry for the zombies. I think this was something intentional on the part of the creators. For example, there is a scene early on when Rick is leaving the hospital and there is a female zombie that has here lower body crushed and basically can\u2019t move (I haven\u2019t seen the TV show\u2026yet\u2026but I think this is the woman from the show): \nHer body is emaciated and yet she can\u2019t die (presumably for quite a long time). She is just lying there moaning and unable to move. She looked...pitiable, at least in the story.Later on Rick sees this same zombie again and she is in the exact same spot and you can tell it makes him sad. There are similar scenes throughout the book including this\u2026\nHere, Rick and a boy are sneaking into town to try and find more guns and they come across this scene\u2026all of the zombies you see are \u201calive\u201d (i.e. zombie alive) and yet many of them are trapped and can\u2019t really move. I found this aspect to be very compelling and added an additional layer to the dread of becoming one of these creatures. I thought the writers did an excellent job in this respect. Overall, I was very impressed with this first volume and plan to continue reading the series. Well written, well constructed plot with believable characters and an engaging storyline. As far as I was concerned, the story was only missing two things that would have made it perfect:ZOMBIE STORMTROOPERS\nAND, OF COURSE\u2026.\nBut that's just me...and I'm a GUY...and I refer you back to the first picture."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "[ We just got back from a family vacation.

Most people do like it. They like it a lot. I didn't, which doesn't make anyone better or smarter than anyone else, we just have different tastes.I appreciate Robert Kirkman wanting to write a social commentary and not just a horror story, but I don't know that he needs to state this in the introduction - all good zombie (and horror) stories are dealing with more than just the surface material, so Kirkman emphasizing his social commentary sounds more like him trying to convince everyone his stuff is smart and deserving of our attention and praise; why not let his graphic novel prove its merit on its own?I didn't feel that the character development was that deep. The greatest transgressor here was Lori, who is very one-dimensional. She's the most incompetent woman in the whole story. To me, she is just the whining wife character who tries to frustrate Rick's chivalric heroism by not wanting him to go to the city, or she's the over-protective mother figure who doesn't want their son, Carl, to be taught how to shoot a gun (silly women, not letting their boys become men). She's helpless, submissive, and mostly just obnoxious.I didn't feel that Kirkman explored some of the issues of survival very thoroughly. For example, gender issues and the division of labor is raised when some of the women are going to wash the clothes. But the issue is opened by Donna's shallow complaints about women doing the washing and men doing the hunting. Her argument is bland and Lori's response is equally so, she claims it \"isn't about women's rights . . . it's about being realistic and doing what needs to be done.\" This is a convenient response to shut down Donna, who is very obviously constructed as a whining, judgmental character (we're not supposed to agree with her, but are supposed to discard her opinion as rapidly as Lori does). The problem is that if you're wanting to survive in the apocalypse (or if you just wanna be able to live in our regular supposedly non-apocalyptic life), everyone should be learning as many skills as possible. Kirkman has the opportunity to examine gender roles here, but chooses to reduce the issue to a series of bumper sticker statements that don't really say anything.This becomes even more of a problem for me when later the women are taught how to shoot. After the argument over who washes and who hunts, it seems silly that women are expected to learn so-called \"manly\" skills like shooting a gun but men are allowed to remain ignorant to washing clothes. It's a man's world, zombies or no zombies. Obviously, women should learn how to shoot to protect themselves and to catch food, but domestic chores are also important for survival and the men should learn those too. Is this a small detail I'm picking at? Perhaps. But it happens so often in our culture and our stories that it really annoys the hell out of me. And I don't think this is the characters being ignorantly sexist, I think it's Kirkman being ignorantly sexist.Another instance of cheap dramatics used to show Lori's helplessness and Kirkman's lame gender use is following the laundry washing when the women are attacked by a zombie and Dale beheads it with his axe. The zombie's head is still \"alive\" which logically means they have to shoot the head to kill it, even though Dale is holding his axe and we see many zombies dispatched with axes and hatchets (including right before this moment when Rick kills the zombie feeding on the deer with his hatchet). Using the gun to kill the head is a lame move, creating bland dramatics to get Rick and Shane to come running back to camp, where Lori cries on Rick's shoulder, completely beside herself with fear - \"Oh, God, Rick . . . it was awful.\" This isn't interesting or exciting, it's an attempt to make a story exciting because the more action, the more cool the story, the more readers.Gender studies issues aside, The Walking Dead just moves too quickly a lot of the time. A story focusing on the day-to-day challenge of surviving in a blighted landscape should dwell on the monotony of survival, at least some of the time. Kirkman wants the story to drag along and take its time, but it just felt rushed to me. It's like he wanted to have dead time where not much was happening, but then got bored with it and just rushed us on to the next zombie scene where we can be thrilled by Tony Moore's grisly art - mundane chores don't sell stories, but violence does.Moore's art is pretty good, especially the zombies. But this is an emphasis again on grotesque body horror and violence. There are lots of close-ups of heads getting hacked at and shot. The gore abounds and while that isn't always a bad thing because we are reading a fantasy and zombie stories are a violent, nasty subject, I wonder if Moore was a bit too enamored with killing things. As I said, I wanted to like this graphic novel, but in the end it was just okay. It coulda, shoulda been brilliant and there are nice moments and signs of real quality. But the effort to make it stellar proved too difficult, so Kirkman and co. chose the much easier, safer route of superficiality."}, {"userName": "Alejandro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/665584-alejandro", "userReview": "The days won't be same anymore!\nThis is the first volume of the softcover editions of \"The Walking Dead\", collecting the comic book issues from #1 to #6.Creative Team:Writer: Robert KirkmanIllustrators: Tony Moore Additional gray tones to inking: Tony Moore Chapter One\nDAYS GONE BYE\n\nRick... Officer Rick Grimes at your service.\nThis chapter is the epic beginning of the mega popular franchise of The Walking Dead that first was comic books, then expanded to a TV series and now there are even prose novels.This first chapter has the great artwork by Tony Moore that certainly made it iconic. The work of Charlie Adlard in the rest of chapters is really good too, specially on the details of things and backgrounds, but definitely if I\u2019d be able to choose, my pick would be on Tony Moore, it was sad that he won\u2019t keep doing the illustrations on the rest of the comic book series. As additional info, Tony Moore remained in the creative team for a while doing the covers of the first twenty-four issues and the covers of the first four regular TPBs.A good thing about The Walking Dead, if you want to enjoy it in comic books along with TV series is that both storylines are different, sure there will be connecting points here and there, and you will meet the same names of characters (in some cases) but they aren\u2019t the same persons, and trust me, while this is my first compendium in the comic book\u2019s storyline, I have been watching the TV series since its own beginning, and both stories are different, both truly great, but different, so don\u2019t afraid of spoilers in any of both formats, since the events are developed quite different. You may think of the \u201cother storyline\u201d of any format, comic books or TV series, as \u201cthe road not taken\u201d. But truly loyal to the spirit of the franchise.Officer Rick Grimes, from the Sheriff Deparment in Cynthiana, Kentucky, suffers a shot injury on duty and he falls into a coma. When he wakes up in a hospital bed, after several weeks, he finds himself alone in the building, or at least he thinks that he is alone. Soon enough he meets several \u201cthings\u201d, walking \u201cthings\u201d that only a word, not matter how nonsensical it sounds, is able to describe those walking \u201cthings\u201d......ZOMBIES.And if things aren\u2019t bad enough, Rick doesn\u2019t know the whereabouts of his wife and son! So, his first priority is to reunite with his family as soon as possible.Rick\u2019s first stop on his own home leads him to meet Morgan and his son, Duane. Morgan explains him how the world gone to hell while Rick was in coma.The US Government was asking population to go to big cities to be defended there by the army, and since Lori, Rick\u2019s wife, has family in Atlanta, Rick decides to go there to search for his wife and son, Carl.On Atlanta, he finds Glenn, an Asian-American young man, who explains him how the world works now.Rick Grimes\u2019 world would never been the same anymore!"}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "Whether you\u2019re a comic book fan or a television buff, one thing remains certain: Rick Grimes is a badass. He\u2019s resourceful too, a real survivor. When other members of the fledgling group are panicking and running around like headless chickens, he acts. When they argue about the next move they should take or which option is safest, Rick, again, acts. He doesn\u2019t mess about. You\u2019ve got to give it to the small town sheriff, he quickly realises what he must do to keep his family alive. And it isn\u2019t pretty. Surviving a zombie apocalypse is no glamorous business. In this first volume, he covers himself with zombie remains to avoid detection in the vast hoard of the undead. By doing so he demonstrates how far he is willing to go protect his family. Guns are everything in this new world, and walking incognito through the hoards is worth the risk if it means a few more firearms around camp. A lot can be said about Rick from these early issues. From the way he handles the unhinged Shane; to the way he allows his seven year old sun to carry a handgun. He realised very early on how bad things were going to get, and he knew how to respond. Everyone else is still clutching to old world ideas; they are trying to live in the past and use the same set of customs. But, the world\u2019s gone to hell. And, at this point, it seems Rick\u2019s the only one fully aware of this fact. Without him, the group would collapse. The man knows what\u2019s on the horizon. I think his encounter with Shane is pivotal because through it he learns what could happen to him, and what is likely to happen to everyone if they\u2019re not careful. It\u2019s a perfect foreshadowing of a possible rise in character insanity. I think because of it Rick has to up his game. He takes charge and begins to make the necessary decisions. More importantly, though, for the rest of the group, he dons the face of optimism. He becomes their source of strength. I think I\u2019m going to really enjoy reading through these; it will be interesting to see how it compares to the television show. Already I\u2019m noticing how sanity, and an ability to cope, is being explored much more in these earlier parts of the story. The show picks the idea up much later. Dale is also a much more established character in these comics. This is going to be a fun reading experience.

This time, I will rate them by the volume that they are.If you have seen the first/second episode of the show, you basically know what goes on in the first volume with some minor changes. Someone lives, some characters don't exist and some characters aren't in the show.The zombie apocalypse is upon the characters in this book (and they have never heard the word zombie). A lone police officer wakes up to this world by himself not knowing where his family is or even how to find them since phones are no longer a thing that can happen. But that isn't going to stop him. He is on a mission to find them.After running into a small family living in his neighborhood and raiding some places for ammunition and protection, and an alternate course of transportation, Rick (that police officer I talked about earlier) finds himself in Atlanta... and surrounded by what many call \"walkers,\" \"biters,\" and other creative names.And there is this: Which was just as great in the comics.There are a lot of scenes in the book that they literally pluck and put in the show to honor it and it just made me so happy to see that. I can already tell that the graphic novel takes a completely and utterly different turn and I'm excited to see this... alternate universe, if you will. I honestly am in AWE of the art in this first volume. If I remember correctly, it kind of changes for the rest of the series. I love the details and the frame that they pick to portray each scene. There's a reason why this series has taken to the media, and I am determined to find out just what that reason is.100% LOVE.

Or at the very least hope it does. I myself cannot stop from venturing into the implications of the dawn of the walking dead. (see what I did there? Too obvious? :/ ) What would I do first? Ah the possibilities! Of course the romance would strip away if such a dawn actually arrives...tut tut tut. I would possibly first have to numb the philosophical Annie and hand the gauntlet (or rather the axe) to the survivalist Annie and so, off to the nitty gritty. The first thing that I noticed was that the artwork was black and white. For some reason this seemed natural, like before I had actually read this I had expected, even wanted this to be monochromatic. The lack of the distractions otherwise afforded by the convergence of colour provide a very clean slate for the characters to exist and the story to proceed. Indeed, the grittiness of the story would have come apart at the seams if we were to keep getting distracted by the rainbow consorts popping up. When I started watching the Tv series, or rather let it fester in my lappie for days before I finally got down to it, sans the popcorn obviously, I was expecting it to be a zombie centric series, and it is. But the zombies, more than anything, provide the driving force and are then littered here and there. The nature of the media of course requires it to be more graphic, but in the graphic novels the zombies are relegated further into the background and the characters are pulled more into prominence. The struggle for survival is nigh! Apparently, the world apocalypse does nothing for the division of labour, such that women still end up washing clothes and the men are out hunting. And only one woman among the group ends up mastering the gun. Pfft! So, the apocalyptic world of Kirkman still harbours some prejudices, but it still makes for a great read. Having religiously followed the TV series since after the rocky start, and having only picked up the graphic novels to fill the void left between the EPISODES of the latest season, I was surprised to find the comics much better than the TV version. Which is saying something considering that the TV series us really, really good. And incredibly fast paced. At my snail pace too, I might end up years ahead of the series within a month!

My first SF read as a burgeoning nerd was The Day of the Triffids. It certainly moulded me into the reader that I am today. But although these stories are fiction, the more scientifically removed from reality zombie type apocalypse is by far not my favourite. Nuclear fallout, deadly virus, environmental collapse; these all seem entirely plausible. But there is no precedence for zombies despite fans holding onto the parasites of insects stories.Zombie apocalypses are not for me.But I do like Shaun of the Dead. That has to do with laughs though.So investing this much time in zombie apocalypse was a big leap for me and I did enjoy the comic series on the first read-through. But watching the series afterwards I was struck by the differences in character and the stories. I abandoned the series midway through series 3. I felt it was too talky. The main characters annoyed me and were more stupid than their comic counterparts. The Governor was just not scary.So here I am a couple of years later and I'm going to reread the comic series.It's interesting to note that like 28 Day Later the story starts with a complete ripoff of Triffids. The main character has been in hospital and wakes up to the apocalypse. This time it's Rick, a police officer who was injured by gunshot wound. Rick wakes up to a very different world. I think it hints that there was about 4 weeks or so that he was in a coma. How he survived I do not know. Power was off. Surely anything giving him nourishment via drip in that time needed power or the need to be replaced. Shhh Brendon, don't poke holes!We follow Rick as he tries to make sense of his immediate neighbourhood and then tries to meet his family. This quest leads him towards Atlanta, Georgia.The people he meets are interesting and they do each have their own stories. That's one strength of the comics. There are no cookie-cutter characters and the writer does manage to give them all a voice. We end this volume with a large confrontation between Rick's old world and the new. It definitely tells everyone that old world allegiences do not matter in the new world.So we are left with everyone on the move south towards warmer weather and away from the zombie hordes in Atlanta."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin", "userReview": "I'm a complete amateur when it comes to this stuff, but I'm really enjoying my time exploring comics and graphic novels. It's hard to rate them because I don't have anything else to really compare them against since I've only read two, so four stars is my baseline for now. I watched the first few seasons of the show, but then I lost interest when they just wandered around a farm for episode after episode. I get bored easily so I moved on to something else, probably Breaking Bad or something, I don't know. But, then everyone is all like, \"Justin, it gets better! You gotta check it out again!\" to which I generally ignore this enthusiasm and watch something else, probably Narcos or something because obviously I like shows about manufacturing and selling illegal drugs. So recently I find myself in this comic book superhero movie TV graphic novel Marvel DC Universe X-Men Apocalypse Star Wars phase and I ran across this bad boy while browsing the deep dark depths of the interwebs. Did you like that alliteration? This was exciting stuff. As someone who has been an avid fan of grayscale in any art form for the past 20 years (that's a rough estimate because I really have no idea) I really liked the drawings whether they depicted zombies biting someone's face off or a slow zoom out of a desolate wasteland. They were really well done and added an extra creepy element to the story like when The Mist released a black and white version of the movie and it made it feel a whole lot different than the boring regular old color version. The story was also really cool and reminded me why I started watching the TV show in the first place. There are zombie attacks like crazy, but there is depth to the characters. There are emotions and desperation and hope and fear all rolled up into the story that makes it easier to feel for this motley crew of people. I'm excited to continue reading these and yeah yeah yeah I started the show again recently. I'm going to give it another shot and see what happens when these guys get the hell off the stupid farm.

That\u2019s to say, I watched the series before reading the book, or graphic novel to be exact. Heck, when I purchased \u201cthe complete season one\u201d I wasn\u2019t even aware that it was based on a book. Now, when something like this happens, there is absolutely no way to undo it. There is no way to un-remember the visual medium and any first impressions, so it\u2019s all spilt milk.But it is every goodreader\u2019s sworn duty, if you\u2019ve enjoyed the show, to read the books... if only to consider the parallels, and the differences. There are some hilarious memes out there which you\u2019ll appreciate a lot more once you\u2019ve read this, at the very least. I particularly enjoyed the joke about the post-apocalyptic lawns always being mown and neat (in the book everything is overgrown and decrepit, as you would expect).As for the book: it\u2019s pretty good, although it\u2019s pretty darn brusque. To be completely honest, I have mixed feelings about it. Normally I\u2019d be quick to say the book is better than the movie (it is almost always the case), but there are actually one or two things that the show does better (in my opinion). However, it\u2019s early days yet, since this is only book 1, so I\u2019ll see how it progresses from here.It\u2019s interesting to note that the art is black & white. This didn\u2019t immediately appeal to me, but it serves well to underline the dreary existence of a zombie-apocalypse. And the art is just as gruesome as what you\u2019d expect after seeing the show. It obviously isn\u2019t a direct adaptation either. The TV show does take some artistic license, but for the most part it\u2019s for the best, especially the Shane arc, which is just a bit awkwardly handled in the book.All in all, it isn\u2019t mind-blowing, and I probably wouldn\u2019t have read it if it wasn\u2019t for the show. But it\u2019s interesting enough that I will continue to read the series, at least as long as I\u2019m watching the show."}, {"userName": "An", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1534133-an", "userReview": "A completely inappropriate birthday gift for someone with necrofobia - or pseudonecrofobia - or hemi-necrofobia - or pauci-animafobia.Well written.

I can see why this series has gotten so much acclaim and had such success. I did however, watch the first season of the show before I knew it was a graphic novel. And once I started reading I finished this volume in a couple hours without putting it down.The zombies! They are amazing, and he wrote them so well, you really feel for them, they aren't your crazed psycho zombies, or your fast constantly hunting zombies, no, they lounge around, are slow, they wait for the scent of people, and at times you feel sorry for them. The plot and characters! Its not all zombies, death, and gore, although that definitely has a huge effect on things. The character development, surviving without much sleep, always around the same people, the lingering grief that comes with losing everything, everyone, and your past life, how the breakdown of society and everything we know can effect people differently, this was the focus of most of this volume. The survival and how to move on with life as we know it when everything else has gone to crap.It was a very good read and Kirkman brought a great in your face realism to it, and the black and white artwork was a great touch and throwback to old zombie flicks."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah", "userReview": "I don't watch the TV show but I really enjoyed this comic. It was interesting and I liked how it focused on people and what would happen to people if there was a zombie apocalypse. I loved the introduction. I really liked the work Tony Moore did too. The comic has left me wanting more and I can't wait to see what happens in the rest of the comics."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "Officer Rick Grimes gets shot in the call of duty and goes into a coma. When he awakens in the hospital weeks later, he finds himself alone in a world where the zombie apocalypse has happened \u2013 and his family have disappeared. So begins Rick\u2019s journey to find his family as, in a world where the end can come at any moment, he and the other survivors become the walking dead. It\u2019s taken me a while to get around to actually reading the world\u2019s most popular comic (The Walking Dead #115 was 2013\u2019s bestselling single issue comic and the trades dominated the top 10 bestsellers list!) and it\u2019s mostly because it feels very unoriginal. Robert Kirkman\u2019s other creator-owned series, Thief of Thieves, reads like a shameless re-telling of Ocean\u2019s 11 with generous helpings of Elmore Leonard (Out of Sight in particular). The Walking Dead feels like every zombie story ever plus some scenes are lifted wholesale from specific zombie movies. Rick waking up in the abandoned hospital is identical to the opening of 28 Days Later, while escaping the zombie hordes in the city is like that George Romero picture, oh what\u2019s it called, oh right, ALL OF THEM! That said, despite all of that, I was drawn into the book. Kirkman knows that zombies are always second to the characters in every zombie story, and he focuses instead on building them up. The relationship between Lori and Shane is a brilliant touch that works perfectly in this scenario, bringing their situation and the trio of characters vividly to life. The zombie action is handled really well too as Rick and Glenn\u2019s forays into doomed Atlanta are very exciting. Kirkman\u2019s approach to the writing of this series is akin to classic horror from the 90s and beyond, incorporating schlocky horror movie jump scares, and artist Tony Moore\u2019s preference for wide panels adds to the cinematic flavour of the comic. In this sense I find the comic somewhat annoying as it\u2019s like it\u2019s not using the medium to full effect, choosing instead to adopt a storyboard-type aspect that makes it feel like the comic was a natural stepping stone to the more lucrative medium of film (or, as it turned out, TV). I\u2019m conflicted about this book. On the one hand, I\u2019m interested in the characters and what they\u2019ll do next. Parts of the book were exciting and enjoyable to read and I\u2019m going to pick up Volume 2. Moore\u2019s art isn\u2019t bad but he\u2019s not producing amazing panels. And on the other hand, there were parts that felt recycled, the art and writing were both serviceable at best, and on the whole Kirkman isn\u2019t doing anything original with the zombie concept that we haven\u2019t seen before. And, man, is this is a miserable comic! It\u2019s an complete downer from start to finish (and what an insane finale!). It\u2019s a decent start to the series but not an amazing comic by a long shot."}, {"userName": "destiny \u2620 howling libraries", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15335689-destiny-howling-libraries", "userReview": "I've been watching The Walking Dead for years on AMC (though I'm not up to date on the latest season), but this was my first time picking up the graphic novel series that inspired it. I've been told by so many people that the graphic novels are incredible, so I finally decided to see what the hype was about. Those people were not wrong, let me tell you! I LOVED this graphic novel. The art is fantastic (and I was amazed by how similar some of the characters look to the actors/actresses who were cast to play them), and the story line is, as expected, really enjoyable and action-packed. There are a few differences from the show, as I assumed there would be, but without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the ending of this graphic novel was so different and unexpected that it made my jaw drop."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "So far it's really interesting to see how DRASTICALLY different the TV show is...

So I'm finally getting around to it, and I have to say, I really enjoyed it. It starts off with a bang, literally, and just keeps building from there. I LOVE the artwork, and though this is black and white only (not sure if other editions are color - I have the compendium and am just reviewing the individual volumes as I go) I think that the artwork is really effective. Almost more effective for being just black and white - it adds a bleakness that I think really works. I like the zombies, and how they look appropriately scary. I like that they are the relentlessly hungry, I'm just gonna chew your face off zombies, but there's still room for the reader to learn about them, because there's no info about what they are, or why they are here, etc. I think that's also realistic, and I'm interested in learning about the zombies as the characters do. One thing that I would say is that the characterizations feel a little 2D and cardboard at this point. I'm hoping that, since there are so many volumes in the series, this will start to ease up and feel more natural as the series progresses. But still, a very promising start and I am definitely looking forward to reading more of these!"}, {"userName": "Dylan Williams", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7023131-dylan-williams", "userReview": "Really different from the TV show, but also really, really good! I loved how well the characters were drawn, it was really easy to tell them all apart - which is a good thing because there are a lot of characters! In the intro to my edition the author makes it perfectly clear that his aim is to focus on the development of these characters rather than a traditional zombie plot - which he definitely does - the characters were fantastic! The pacing is also really great, it's fast when it needs to be, but doesn't hesitate to take full pages to focus on some really emotional scenes...
