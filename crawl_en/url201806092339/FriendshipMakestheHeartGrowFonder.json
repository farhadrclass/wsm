This is a very \u201cSex-and-the-City\u201d style book, involving 3 women getting away from their daily lives to Europe. This is a no-nonsense book about everyday traumas faced by the 3 women and how their friendships made them overcome those traumas more easily. P.C. Cast, a YA author, has once quote about friendship as:\u201cIf you have good friends, no matter how much life is sucking, they can make you laugh.\u201dThe words are pretty true and this book aptly justifies this quote. No matter how hard it was, but when they found each other, everything fell into their places with the help of each other.Monique is a widowed-mother, who still cannot let go of her beloved husband, who died due to cancer. Becky, a step-mom and mother of 2 children, is suffering from drastic life-changing conditions, including marital problems. Judy's youngest child is going to be in college very soon making her lonelier all the way. Other than being neighbors, all three women are in their 30s, 40s and 50s and are facing some serious life-altering issues. Monique and her late husband, Lenny had made a \"bucket-list\" of so many cool things to do together, but after Lenny's death, the \"bucket-list\" unfortunately sits in an empty closet in Monique's life. But when her daughter is getting ready to leave for college, she decides to fulfill her husband's \"bucket-list\" along with her two neighbors, who too were facing some similar issues in their life. Hence they take-off to Europe for full-2-weeks. From romantic Paris to seductive Amsterdam to grand England, they all get a wider perspective to face their troubles in their life bravely and get to know themselves, thus bringing them closer as friends. From sharing dirty secrets to laughing off their heads, indeed their hearts grow more and more fonder.Lisa's lyrical and eloquent words along with some vivid and narrative descriptions, makes the book very delectable and exciting. The tale is all about being neighbors to friends to being best friends and also how sometimes getting away from your own nest can make you see things and handle things more easily. The right amount of emotion was poured into the book, so I went from crying to laughing and sometimes even excitedly screaming with joy! Well no doubt the beauty of those places makes the book more interesting. Each place these 3 women visit, they grow more and more, in a way, after their whole trip, they got some deep insights about themselves as well as about their lives, thus making them handle things with care and love. A cute, light and no doubt a \"no-strings attached\" type of book that you surely wanna read while lazing around the pool or the beach!"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3527423-debbie", "userReview": "Monique lost her husband Lenny to cancer four years ago, and she\u2019s had his \u201cbucket list\u201d hanging over her head, so when she learns that a friend is suffering a loss of her own she proposes a preposterous idea.Becky has just gotten news that\u2019s making her already dimming eyes more cloudy, she\u2019s got children to raise and a troubled marriage to figure out, she\u2019s got no time for going blind. When her friend and neighbor who\u2019s suffered a loss of her own suggests completing her dead husband\u2019s bucket list she thinks it\u2019s the craziest idea ever.Judy is suffering a huge case of empty nest syndrome that\u2019s left her at loose ends which makes her feel small when she learns of Becky\u2019s situation and thinks of the loss that Monique has suffered, especially since her married life is in good working order. But when Monique invites her on this complete the bucket list trip, she\u2019s all for it.This journey will mean different things to these three friends who\u2019ve all suffered loss, who\u2019re all at a fork in their particular road. Will they be enlightened or will this trip just make their losses more real. Will Monique find closure, and resolve to live again? Will Becky come to terms with her diagnosis, can she face what ever waits for her at home? Will Judy find a new reason to get up in the morning when she\u2019s got no to do list to complete?Lisa Verge Higgins has delivered another masterpiece in fiction and what makes it especially memorable is how she really \u201cgets\u201d friendship, the unique relationships that defines kindred spirits. She takes reality to a new height and she delivers it not with the happy endings we find in romance and yet not with unhappy endings either, what she gives instead is a realistic recipe for life, served with a huge helping of hope. Her plot is not far fetched, it could happen to you or someone you know. Her narrative flows and her characters shine and no matter who you are or where you are in your particular life journey you will find a bit of you inside her pages.Lisa you\u2019ve taken me around the world more than once now and each time I find something new to love about what you lovingly have to say.

These are not cheating wives or cougars dealing with mid-life crises, but women who do something a little extra to relax and have fun. They share a closeness with each other and learn how to be better family members and people in general. They learn to not lie to themselves and to allow growth into their lives.I also want to know where they are to have Monique's mom going to IRVINGTON to pick up some groceries. I don't mean to offend, but just reading or hearing the name of that town drives a spike of fear down my spine.

They worry over their children and while Becky is still handling school age catastrophes, both Judy and Monique are dealing with that awful empty nest. Each one has a unique set of circumstances to their lives but they have each other\u2019s back. For four years, Monique has mourned her husband\u2019s death and lamented over the bucket list he had come up with for her. There were times Monique looked it over but more times when tears just hit the paper it was written on. When unexpected news hits one of the friends Monique decides it is time to transfer the bucket into a pitcher and start watering the flowers of adventure. The friends take off on a trip through Europe following the directions on the list that seems to be at times odd if not downright location peculiar. Monique keeps coming back to question why did my late husband want me to see this. There is more than one bad decision when the veer off the itinerary and some frantic exchanges of where are we now. However, while the path they are taking is not completely clear, the destiny is a blazing neon sign that keeps saying move on. Lisa Verge Higgins captures the essence of every woman, who they are, and how every change affects the beat of their heart."}, {"userName": "Jodi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2822898-jodi", "userReview": "I loved this book.

Every now and then she gets out the bucket list that the two of them compiled while Lenny was undergoing chemo treatments. It kept them occupied and it was a way of hoping for the future. When Monique realizes that her two friends are going through their own life problems, she gets out the list and persuades them to take a trip first to London and then through Europe doing the things on that list--from eating at the Eiffel Tower, to visiting the catacombs in France, to blowing $1,000 in a Monaco casino, and 10 other equally unusual and, at times, frightening things to do. I just didn't enjoy this book much at all. There was one chapter, on page 200, that had me laughing and that was the only time I felt as though I saw a real, fun friendship between the women. The pages before and after that chapter never gave me a sense of who these women really were and how they ever became friends in the first place. There was a lot of \"sniping\" at each other and a feeling of one or the other acting superior and diminishing each other.I wasn't impressed with the bucket list and I became bored with the detailed description of the many places they visited that wouldn't have been my first choices if I were going abroad...but I guess that was the point. Lenny wanted Monique out of her comfort zone. It was just that one of the other three was always complaining and no one seemed to have any fun. I didn't have any fun reading about the lack of fun they were having.Finally, I found it depressing that all three women were so depressed. I can't imagine three depressed women on a trip together and even though every now and then one of them would try to rally around the other two, it just seemed too contrived and too clinical. It would have been so much better for me if at least one of the three women was actually happy and wanted to boost her friends' morale. Reading about their experiences was painful. I'm so glad I wasn't on that trip with them!"}, {"userName": "Lorelei's ", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4244549-lorelei-s", "userReview": "This story is about three friends who are neighbors, they're between 30, 40, and 50.  Becky was just diagnosed with a life changing condition and is having marital problems. She's a step mom and mother of 2 young kids. Monique is a widow with an only daughter planning to go to college thousands of miles away.  Judy the mother of 5, whose youngest is headed for college making her an empty nester, finds herself wanting to know what to do in this new stage of her life. They're struggling with their own set of problems, but when Monique decides to pursue that bucket list she and her late husband made before he died of cancer, she invites them to come to Europe for 2 weeks and together they find some answers and realizations they've been needing to find to help them move on.  It's quite a trip, full of excitement and new discoveries, things they didn't know about each other, making their bond even stronger. Situations are realistic, funny, touching and inspiring. Even though some situations are very serious and sad, the story doesn't leave you overwhelmed and depressed.  I normally read books in one sitting, but even though I couldn't, I was always eager to come back till the very end.  The author ends each chapter with intrigue, making you wonder and eager to see what happens next, I love that. I think you'll relate to something in this story like I did. I truly enjoyed it and highly recommend it if your looking for a book about friendships and overcoming obstacles."}, {"userName": "Nancy Herkness", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8165584-nancy-herkness", "userReview": "Three women from the suburbs try to escape from their problems by taking a whirlwind trip to Europe, but find they can\u2019t outrun themselves.
