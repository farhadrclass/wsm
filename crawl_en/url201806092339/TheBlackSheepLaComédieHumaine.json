Agathe Rouget is the daughter of a rather nasty doctor, that seems to be putting it mildly, and Balzac laces the tale of Doctor Rouget and his unfortunate wife with innuendos. While Rouget, a petty domestic tyrant, dotes on his son and encourages Jean-Jacques\u2019 very worst behaviour, he loathes Agathe as he suspects that she was fathered by another man. So when an opportunity arises to get rid of Agathe, the vindictive Rouget carts off his young daughter to Paris and the home of her maternal uncle, a grocer named Desgoings. Unfortunately, the grocer falls foul of the guillotine within a week of Agathe\u2019s arrival, but then, Bridau, a minor official, falls in love with Agathe and they marry. The Bridaus have two boys Philippe and Joseph.Through the passing years, Bridau a hard-working civil servant, seems to be working himself into a early grave serving under Napoleon. Bridau leaves his widow and two sons in modest circumstances but with a pension to keep them in simple, but genteel style. At this point in the story, the widow Desgoings makes the practical decision to move in with Agathe, her niece by marriage, so that they can pool their resources.Despite the fact that Agathe has been effectively disinherited from her family, life should not be too unpleasant for Madame Bridau and her two sons, but human vices get in the way. Madame Desgoings turns out to have a gambling problem, and then the Bridau boys grow up\u2026.All these family happenings are compressed into the early pages, the rest of the story is devoted to the Bridau brothers, Philippe and Joseph. Philippe grows up to become an appalling human being, and at first he seems to hit his stride as a rapidly advancing officer in Napoleon\u2019s army. After the Battle of Waterloo, Philippe, now a colonel becomes just another of Napoleon\u2019s bitter ex-officers, drinking in the local taverns, sporting with prostitutes, gambling money he borrows or steals from his family, and living beyond his means. In the meantime, Joseph, the less favoured but good son, becomes an artist. Going by The Black sheep I am sure there are better Balzac novels, there are some pretty nasty individuals here that I couldn't wait to see the back of!, Balzac, uses the whole 'money is power' theme well and here we see the depths to which some people are prepared to sink in order to gain a fortune. While he is spot on target when it comes to the predictability of human nature, he shows a lack of respect for the reader in places after being distracted by endless details that kept recurring without adding anything that wasn't already there. I will read more Balzac, hopefully something where I don't spend half the time despising those within. 3.5/5"}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "Produced by John Bickers, and Dagny, and David WidgerTranslator: Katharine Prescott WormeleyMissing from the Gutenberg frontpage is the original title: La RabouilleusePlot summary from wiki: The action of the novel is divided between Paris and Issoudun. Agathe Rouget, who was born in Issoudun, is sent to be raised by her maternal relatives, the Descoings in Paris by her father Doctor Rouget. She suspects (wrongly) that he is not her true father. There she marries a man named Bridau, and they have two sons, Philippe, and Joseph. Monsieur Bridau dies relatively young, Philippe, who is the eldest and his mother's favourite, becomes a soldier in Napoleon's armies, and Joseph becomes an artist. Philippe, the elder son is shown to be a courageous soldier, but is also a heavy drinker and gambler. He resigns from the army after the Bourbon Restoration out of loyalty to Napoleon. Joseph is a dedicated artist, and the more loyal son, but his mother does not understand his artistic vocation.http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1380 Looks delish!Opening: In 1792 the townspeople of Issoudun enjoyed the services of a physician named Rouget, whom they held to be a man of consummate malignity. Were we to believe certain bold tongues, he made his wife extremely unhappy, although she was the most beautiful woman of the neighborhood. Perhaps, indeed, she was rather silly. But the prying of friends, the slander of enemies, and the gossip of acquaintances, had never succeeded in laying bare the interior of that household. Doctor Rouget was a man of whom we say in common parlance, \"He is not pleasant to deal with.\" Consequently, during his lifetime, his townsmen kept silence about him and treated him civilly. His wife, a demoiselle Descoings, feeble in health during her girlhood (which was said to be a reason why the doctor married her), gave birth to a son, and also to a daughter who arrived, unexpectedly, ten years after her brother, and whose birth took the husband, doctor though he were, by surprise. This late-comer was named Agathe. Inclement weather and the soothing sound of both washer and drier in action meant I hunkered down under the settee quilt with my ipad to finish off this tale. Another great character observation by the rough diamond pen of Balzac. Checking up on the title was something of an eye-opener:'La Rabouilleuse' is the nickname of Flore Brazier used behind her back by the people of Issoudun. Max takes offence when some of his friends use it in conversation. Adamson translates the term as \"the Fisherwoman\". From the French Wiki of this page, it appears that it is a regional word for someone who stirs up the water in a river, more easily to catch fish such as crayfish. \"(En fran\u00e7ais r\u00e9gional, une personne qui agite et trouble l\u2019eau pour effrayer les \u00e9crevisses et les p\u00eacher plus facilement)\". The nickname is a reference to the job that she did as a young girl when helping her uncle to fish for crayfish, before becoming a servant to the Rouget household. The English title of the book therefore moves the focus from her to the two brothers. - wikiI once mentioned to Dagny that embarking on Balzac will only happen once Zola was complete, yet I don't seem to be doing too badly at 3.5* average per book:3* Cousin Bette 3* The Unknown Masterpiece4* The Mysterious Mansion2* HonorineTR Pere GoriotTR Eug\u00e9nie Grandet"}, {"userName": "Jared Logan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4703382-jared-logan", "userReview": "I learned about this book from The Guardian\u2019s 100 Greatest Novels of All Time list: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003...The Guardian described it as \u201coverlooked\u201d so I decided I\u2019d read it. That way I can describe myself as someone who reads overlooked books. Also, I\u2019m a sucker for a meaty 19th Century novel.The Black Sheep is very entertaining. The pacing is excellent. The chapters are short and you never feel like you're plodding through a morass of descriptive prose. I mean, let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s what a lot of 19th century novels are like.Not this one. As you read, you feel as if you\u2019re just hanging out with your Uncle Balzac and he\u2019s telling you the local gossip. It\u2019s pretty damn juicy. The plot concerns two brothers. One is an artist, the other a soldier. Their widowed mother loves the soldier unconditionally and loves the artist\u2026 well, a little less. Of course the irony is that the artist is poor, but devoted to his family, while the soldier is a drinker and a gambler and an all-around bad egg. Then there\u2019s the family fortune that is in the clutches of a sniveling estranged brother, who is of course controlled by a sexy femme fatale and her lover who are determined to take it for themselves. Who will control the inheritance? And will the mother ever learn to appreciate her one devoted son? Balzac is funny. His characters are lively and recognizable. The scenes of Parisian life contrast well with the scenes from provincial life. The dual settings of the novel bounce off one another in interesting ways, like the personalities of the two brothers.This book has a lot to say about personal character. What type of person can make a fortune in this world? Is it better to be pious and poor, or ruthless and rich? When we train someone to be a soldier, are we training them to be forever dissatisfied with the little humilities and everyday doldrums of civilian life? Lots of really interesting questions answered interestingly by interesting characters. If you\u2019re a Dickens or Dostoyevsky fan, but you want something a little lighter, this is a perfect book for you."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "From BBC radio 4 - Classical Serial:Chris Dolan's dramatisation of Honore de Balzac's entertaining tale of family rivalry and fortunes lost and won, set in 19th-century France.After Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, Philippe Bridau becomes a reckless gambler who steals from his mother to finance his obsession.

(1842). Honore de Balzac. ****.\tThis is one of Balzac\u2019s lesser known novels, but is still in his \u201cHuman Comedy\u201d series. It\u2019s a family story involving money \u2013 as so many of his novels do. The two main characters are men \u2013 unscrupulous men who use any and all devious means to take over the fortune of, in one case, his uncle, and, in the other, the husband of his mistress. The action is split between Paris, and a small town called Issoudun. After you get through Balzac\u2019s usual descriptions of the cities, and of the families of the two men, the story actually starts. This technique always reminds me of Raymond Carver and his streets of L.A. I suspect that Balzac came first, however. Although the telling of the story is melodramatic, it is still engaging, and reveals another type of man for Balzac to explore. Trying to give a synopsis of the plot would be almost impossible, but I can urge you to read it. I felt it was one of Balzac\u2019s better novels.

It's the tale of two brothers utterly unlike each other, and how The Fates reward good and evil. It is didactic to some extent, but also entertaining, particularly towards the end when it becomes a bit of a page-turner...Joseph, the younger brother, is an unattractive man blessed with the dubious talent of being a great painter. Although he gets commissions from the rich and powerful (and will earn himself a place in art history) the bourgeois don't like his work and this consigns him to an uncertain income for most of his life and poverty during the early stages of his career. His father, a civil servant, died of overwork under Napoleon and his widowed mother Agathe has no money thanks to the craftiness of her brother, Jean-Jacques Rouget who lives on the family estate in Issoudun.Philippe, on the other hand is handsome, stylish and heroic. He joins the military and impresses Napoleon. He is dissolute and wasteful and forever scrounging money from his mother and brother to pay his gambling debts, a position which gets worse when he stays loyal to Napoleon and refuses to serve the Bourbons (who reduce his pay). One thing leads to another and Philippe ends up in serious trouble because he is suspected of being involved in plots but he remains the apple of his mother's eye. So when he is destitute and at risk of execution for treason she and Joseph set off for Issoudun to seek help from Jean-Jacques. Up to this point the story has been a fairly predictable morality tale, but from here on it becomes more and more interesting. Jean-Jacques is now in his late fifties and in thrall to Flore, his father's ward, a peasant girl that he adopted because she took his fancy. (He died before anything nefarious happened to her). Flore looks after Jean-Jacques' every need on condition that Max, her fancyman and a real ratbag, lives in the house too. He doesn't marry her, much as he would like to, because he fears that once she has access to his money she will do a bunk with Max and go to Paris. Max, a former captain now with nothing worthwhile to do, surreptitiously leads a gang of hooligans who entertain themselves destroying other people's property and poisoning dogs for fun. He is determined to get hold of Jean-Jacques' money and plans to use Flore to get it. He is thought to be the 'natural' son of old Rouget so people are well-disposed towards him, little realising that he leads the gang that torments the community. Agathe and Joseph, despite the support of the Hochons next door, are no match for these two, and eventually they go back to Paris with nothing to show for their pains.Philippe, meanwhile, has been convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to exile in a place called Auten, but thanks to the intervention of Desroche, a retired but still influential bureaucrat who's remained a friend of the family, the place of exile is switched to Issoudun. Yes, it's a case of 'set a thief to catch a thief' and the chicanery that takes place while Philippe tries to oust Flore and Max is complex but vastly entertaining. (I bet this story's been made into a film!) But, as the clich\u00e9 says, leopards don't change their spots and Philippe celebrates his success by casting off his guise of sensible citizen and returning to Paris to behave as badly as before, breaking his foolish mother's heart and enraging Joseph. Does he get his revenge? You'll have to read the book to find out!"}, {"userName": "Dagny", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10742602-dagny", "userReview": "The two brothers are Philippe and Joseph Bridau.

(Bearing in mind that the word \"bourgeoisie\" in Balzac does not have its modern post-Marx meaning of \"the capitalist class\" but rather is an ill-defined term for anyone who is neither noble nor poor, lives in a city or town rather than on a farm, and has a certain amount of property and \"respectability\" -- more or less equivalent to the even more meaningless American phrase \"middle class\".) The novel is in the division entitled \"Scenes de la vie de province\" and the subsection \"Les Celibataires\"; it was originally titled Une M\u00e9nage de Gar\u00e7on.Although written in 1842, La Rabouilleuse really resembles Balzac's earliest works in being (in my opinion) somewhat poorly constructed, beginning with fifty or more pages of rather unexciting background and description of the provincial city of Issoudun; the novel then really opens in Paris with the story of the two brothers, Joseph and Philippe Bridau (one of the English titles for the book is The Two Brothers). Joseph is the \"good\" brother, an artist who appears as a minor figure in several other novels of the Com\u00e9die Humaine; Philippe is an ex-dragoon, the \"black sheep\" of the family (the title of another English translation.) About two thirds of the way through, the story abandons the story of the two brothers for the story of the \"Rabouilleuse\" (\"stirrer-up\") Flore Brazier, and the Rouget family (the father and brother of Agathe, the mother of the two brothers). After another fifty pages, Joseph and his mother arrive in Issoudun (followed later by Philippe) and the real plot begins, which is about the struggle between the \"Rabouilleuse\" and her lover, Maxence Gilet, and the Bridaus for the grandfather's inheritance which is controlled by Agathe's brother Jean Jacques Roget. The ending then shifts back to Paris and focuses again on the Bridau brothers.As the introduction to the Livre de Poche edition points out, the central character of the novel is neither Jean Jacques Rouget, the \"gar\u00e7on\" of the original title, nor the \"Rabouilleuse\", but Philippe Bridau, in contrast with his brother, so the two English titles are more accurate to the content of the book. As with so many of Balzac's novels, it is a good story once it gets started, but the main purpose is to depict a particular \"type\", namely the young men who enlisted in the Empereur's \"Grande Arm\u00e9e\" at the end of the Napoleonic period and considered themselves \"cheated\" out of their careers by the Restoration."}, {"userName": "Marc Gerstein", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15102294-marc-gerstein", "userReview": "I had long considered Balzac my favorite author but somehow or other, wound up having gone a long time without reading anything by him. I guess I got distracted by other works. On reading the lesser-known less-discussed work, I see I've been away from Honore for much too long. This reminded me why I admire his work as much as I do.It's part of his humongous human comedy series and as with some others, this one touches both sides of the Paris-versus-Provinces divide that so fascinated Balzac. Fans will recognize many supporting characters who play varying roles in other works. He recycles characters quite a bit, but if you're new to Balzac, don't worry about it. Unlike many who write multi-novel series, with Balzac, each one can and does stand on its own. The protagonists here are brothers Phillipe and Joseph Bridau, a soldier and artist respectively, and their mother Agathe. At the center of it all is Agathe's differing regard for the two brothers and a family inheritance that found its way into the hands of Agathe's a**-hole estranged brother. Naturally, and predictably, there's a struggle for the money. But how it plays out is wildly unpredictable and an example of how watching people go through their lives can be the greatest of all spectator sports. Hence the name for the series; the Human Comedy.I'm not sure why this gem isn't as well known as others in the series. Maybe it has something to do with variations in the title. Some call it \"The Black Sheep.\" Other call it \"The Two Brothers.\" Still others refer to it as \"La Rabouillese\" which does not translate to anything like brothers or black sheep but is instead a nickname attached to the femme fatale of the novel and I'll allow Balzac to explain the name; I couldn't do it justice."}, {"userName": "\u0645\u062c\u06cc\u062f", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34049221", "userReview": "\u0627\u0628\u062a\u062f\u0627 \u06a9\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u06a9:\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647\u0654 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0648\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u067e\u06cc\u0634\u0648\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u06a9\u062a\u0628 \u0631\u0626\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f.\u06a9\u0645\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0646\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u06a9 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0647 \u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f \u06f9\u06f0 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0647 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u062f \u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u06cc\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0633\u062a.\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u06a9 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0644\u06cc\u0644 \u062a\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0628\u06cc \u0646\u0642\u0635 \u0648 \u0641\u0636\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u06cc \u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0644\u0634 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0646\u062f.\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0686\u0646\u062f\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0627\u0648 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0627\u06af\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0648- \u0686\u0631\u0645 \u0633\u0627\u063a\u0631\u06cc - \u0622\u0631\u0632\u0648\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u062f \u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0648 \u0686\u0646\u062f \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0647\u06cc\u06af\u06cc\u0631 \u062a\u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0631\u0648\u063a\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0631\u0633\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a.\u0639\u0646\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0634\u06a9\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u067e\u0648\u0631 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0631 \u0639\u0647\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06a9\u0647 \u0686\u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u062a\u063a\u06cc\u06cc\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a.\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0632\u062f\u0648\u0627\u062c \u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0698\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u0622\u0642\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u0648 \u0648 \u0628\u062f\u0628\u062e\u062a\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0632\u0646 \u062a\u0648\u0633\u0637 \u067e\u0633\u0631\u0646\u0627\u062e\u0644\u0641\u0634 \u0641\u0644\u06cc\u067e \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0647 \u0627\u062a\u0627\u0641\u0642 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062f \u0648 \u067e\u0633 \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u0646"}, {"userName": "Justin Evans", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2184529-justin-evans", "userReview": "It's Balzac, and it's reasonably short, so you know it's pretty powerful. The only interesting thing I have to say about this is stolen from the introduction to the Penguin edition; the translator points out that in this book, unlike many of Balzac's writing, the historical asides are actually relevant and important for the plot, so it's far more unified than the others. Great point. Also, Balzac got the whole 'show you someone who's horrible, then show you someone even worse so that you'll sympathize with the horrible shit' move down pat. George Martin's an amateur by comparison. On the other hand, not sure it's one of the greatest novels of all time, as some poll or other suggested."}, {"userName": "A_girl_from_earth", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2017", "userURL":

Its merits are many. First, it contains wonderful historical material for life in the time immediately after the fall of Napoleon. \u201cThe historical material provided in The Black Sheep is by no means extraneous to the novel, apart from the long description of Issoudun. Better, perhaps, than in any other novel in The Human Comedy, it is intimately interwove into the fabric of the tale.\u201d Second, the characters drawn by Balzac are incredibly memorable. \u201cPhilippe develops into one of the supreme monsters of fiction, every inch the equal in incarnation of the devil. Joseph, of course, remains the same: hard-working, devoted to his mother and aunt, unselfish, tolerant, forgiving. The vicissitudes of the story (the thefts he suffers, his failure to assist Madame Descoings over the lottery ticket, the murder charge, his temporary imprisonment) ruffle but do not embitter him.\u201d Conversely, the simple goodness of Joseph serves as the perfect juxtaposition. The nature of how these two natures are perceived reflects on humanity itself. \u201cJoseph was three years younger than Philippe; he took after his father, but only in the less favourable aspects of his father\u2019s nature. To begin with, no matter what one tried to do about it, his thick black hair was always unkempt, whereas his brother was always neat and good-looking, despite his high spirits. Besides this, Joseph could not keep any article of clothing clean (no one could tell what fatality it was which caused this, but too constant a fatality becomes a habit); if he was given new clothes, he soon had them looking as old as his previous ones. The elder boy looked after his things out of vanity. By slow degrees, the mother grew used to scolding Joseph and holding up his brother to him as an example.\u201d Lastly, the themes themselves are universal. \u201cCalculation is one of the key themes iin The Human Comedy. It is first set out in detail in Old Goriot, a novel written seven years earlier than The Black Sheep. In order to succeed in the world, a man must be ruthless in exploiting others.\u201d While true throughout the novel, perhaps the final judgment is not quite so clear.There are some problems. First, some of the language is quite stilted. \u201cThus, whilst physically resembling his mother the elder of Agathe\u2019s sons had exactly the same character as Dr Rouget, his grandfather. Let us leave the solution of this problem to the twentieth century, with a fine array of names to describe microscopic animalcules; then, perhaps, our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will write as much nonsense on this mysterious subject as has already been written by our learned societies.\u201d Some of the language is quite misogynistic as well. \u201cBut it is easier for a woman to be a good wife than a good mother. A widow has two tasks, with mutually contradictory obligations: she is a mother, yet must exercise paternal authority. Few women are strong enough to understand and play this dual role. And so, despite her qualities of character, poor Agathe was the innocent cause of many misfortunes.\u201d Finally, at times Balzac thoughtlessly and needlessly injects the story with attitudes that are quite offensive to modern society \u2013 a great example is the following anti-Semitic statement. \u201cThere were people hawking second-hand articles which did not seem likely to find any buyers; dealers in old clothes whose stalls gave off the most fearful stench. In other words, the same dubious population which is to be found in such areas in almost every town, and which is dominated by one or two Jews.\u201d Such statements are ironic in a novel that expresses that outward appearance is often no judge whatsoever of right behavior and moral character.Balzac does, however, deliver the major point. \u201cA captain at nineteen and decorated with the Legion of Honour, Philippe \u2013 after serving as aide-de-camp to the Emperor on two battlefields \u2013 greatly flattered his mother\u2019s vanity; and so, though coarse, rowdy and actually without any merit other than the vulgar bravado of a dashing cavalry officer, he seemed to her a man of genius; whereas Joseph, who was small, thin, sickly, with a wild expression on his face, a child who loved peace and tranquility, and dreamed of an artist\u2019s glory, was bound \u2013 in her opinion \u2013 to cause her nothing but torments and anxieties.\u201d Throughout, Agathe forgives her monstrous son, and Joseph is repeatedly taken advantage of. Philippe drives loved ones to pauperism and death. In the last half of the novel, Balzac explores whether such evil skills might be put to good use. Philippe turns his attentions to recovering the inheritance Agathe deserves, and which is in the process of being usurped by upstarts Flore and Max in his uncle\u2019s household. \u201cHe was delighted to satirize Max by living in Mignonnet\u2019s fashion and he wished to allay Maxence\u2019s fears by deceiving him as to his true character. By appearing generous and disinterested, he hoped to be thought of as a fool, whlist all the time encircling his adversary and aiming to obtain his uncle\u2019s inheritance; whereas his mother and brother, who in fact were so disinterested, generous and great, had been accused of calculation when they were acting with na\u00efve simplicity.\u201d Philippe outfoxes Max, a man of similar repugnant character. \u201cEventually Philippe accompanied his uncle back to his door, saying as his parting words; \u2018Do not come to any decision without first consulting me. I know women. I kept one once who cost me much more than Flore will ever cost you! She taught me how to treat the fair sex properly \u2013 and the lesson will stick for the rest of my life. Women are like naughty children. They are inferior animals to men, and you must make them afraid of you, for the worst plight that can befall us is to be governed by the brutes!\u2019\u201d (281)Flore, as calculating as she has been, has deceived herself as to the gravity of her situation until it is too late. \u201cAlas! Where love is concerned, self-interested deception is superior to the truth itself, which is why so many men pay so high a price to clever deceivers.\u201d \u201cAs for the powers of attorney required by the fierce colonel, who was a hero in the eyes of the whole of Issoudun, it was given to him as soon as he needed it; for Flore fell under this man\u2019s domination as completely as France fell under Napoleon\u2019s. Like the moth whose feet are caught in the molten wax of a candle, Rouget rapidly used up his remaining energy.\u201d The novel ends in a note of redemption. Agathe\u2019s confessor visits her on her deathbed and delivers her tough love. \u201c\u2019Be consoled!\u2019 the aged priest continued. \u2018From the form your punishment has taken, I can see that you will be forgiven. God is only harsh on this earth towards his chosen people. Woe betide those whose misdeeds meet with a favourable reception in this world, they will be formed again within humanity until eventually their simple errors are harshly punished, and not until then will they reap the celestial harvest. Your life, my daughter, has been one long act of wrongdoing. You now fall into the pit you have dug for yourself; the only side of our characters in which we ever fail is the one we have weakened within ourselves. You have given your heart to a monster in whom you saw your own fame and glory, and failed to appreciate the son in whom your true glory shines forth! You have been so deeply unjust that you have overlooked the striking contrast between them: you derie your livelihood from Joseph, whereas your other son has constantly plundered you. The poor son who loves you without the reward of an equal love returned provides you with your daily bread, whereas the rich man who has never given you a single thought, and who despises you, hopes for your death.\u2019\u201d She realizes the error of her ways and finally devotes her love to her truly deserving son in her last days. Philippe becomes incredibly wealthy, but ultimately is undone by his earlier comrades in evil. The benefactor of Philippe\u2019s behavior in his mother\u2019s love and his brother\u2019s wealth, ultimately, is the truly deserving soul in the end.See my other reviews here!"}, {"userName": "Alimpic Srdjan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61072393-alimpic-srdjan", "userReview": "Dva brata ra\u017ealovani potpukovnik Filip i \u017dozef mladi slikar u usponu nastoje da svaki na svoj na\u010din dobiju nasledstvo od svog bogatog ro\u0111aka koga u svojim rukama dr\u017ei mutivoda Flora.Ovaj roman je kod nas preveden kao \"Mutivoda\" \u0161to u su\u0161tini u ovom romanu predstavlja igru re\u010di jer Flora je ona koja voli da dobro \"zamuti vodu\" kako bi ostvarila svoje ciljeve, ali je to tako\u0111e bilo i njeno zanimanje kao male devoj\u010dice odakle je i dobila zloglasni nadimak.

The events take place in the time after the Bourbon Restoration. Balzac is certainly a storyteller master and the book is a page turner. What bothered me about it is that some characters (especially those of the two protagonists) are either black or white; totally bad or totally good. The other thing is Balzac\u2019s opinion of women; in the dedication of the book he clearly states that \u201c[h]owever good and tender a mother may be, she cannot fulfill the function of the patriarchal royalty any more than a woman can take the place of a king upon the throne.\u201d In the story he illustrates his theory through the mother\u2019s character. I found this strange after reading Pere Goriot, a few weeks ago, in which a father also didn\u2019t succeed in bringing up his two daughters.
