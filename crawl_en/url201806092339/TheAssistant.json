There were mini info-dumps throughout the entire book that added things that were completely irrelevant to the story. Every woman (especially Emily) in the book was a TSTL doormat and Adrian was a sexual harassment suit waiting to happen. The main characters are supposedly adults, but they acted more like immature kids, and while persistence is usually cute and sexy on a male MC, it was creepy and stalkerish on Adrian. I felt like the author basically pulled out plots and scenes from similar novels that were actually well written and tried to make it something \"new\" and unique, but she failed miserably."}, {"userName": "Selena Lang", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4890227-selena-lang", "userReview": "OK I had multiple problems with this book. The characters were shallow, felt like she was about 14 and he about 16 with their childish behavior and little girl \"cutsie\" attitude. and Adrian was a walking Sexual Harassment Suit just waiting to happen. I mean what type of \"boss\" hits on a total stranger in an interview? get real! And If I had been her I would have slapped him, walked out and filed a complaint about it. Not turned around and accept the job!He was cruel to her at times, deliberately scaring her or embarrassing her. He showed no real genuine feelings for her and she was a doormat..she just kept taking the comments, touches etc. I mean really what 24 year old woman would just give in and do everything he tells her to? A doormat. The scene where he basically tells her he is going to prostitute her out for a night just about did me in. And whats with all the blushes and embarrassment whenever he kisses her or touches her or makes a comment? No one at that age is that naive and stupid. Hell she wasn't a virgin so whats the deal with that? I know the author was trying to show inexperience, but that felt like he was hitting on a 10 year old the way she behaved. And His father - if my future father in law spoke to me like that I would be offended and probably have hit him. It was creepy, not funny. The writing itself was ok, a bit sporadic and it felt like the author was jumping around a bit, but I think with practice and time she could be decent at writing...but her story definitely needs to improve. I really did not understand where all the 4 and 5 stars were coming from. He was not an alpha male, he was psychotic if you ask me. http://areadersreviewing.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Danny Moore", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17621393-danny-moore", "userReview": "When did sexual harassment become acceptable in the work place? The Assistant by Ella Brace was a waste of time and two of my hard earned dollars.  I hated the characters, especially Amy, the best friend. No one was likeable and we had no back story on any of them. So you have no idea who the main character, Emily, is or why she desperatly needs the assisting job. So much so that she sticks by the prick, Adrain, for so long.  Also, who in their right mind lets am irresponsible 25 year old run a multi million dollar business, all by themselves? That was never explained to us, nor was it explained to us how he can be best friends with his high school friend, Allen, but be british? I was never able to figure out if Allen was American or British, like Adrian. I mean he had a sister Lisa who was a teenager so I am assuming Allen is American? But if he is American and Adrian is British and they met in high school...?? See what I mean! Confusing as fudge!  P.s Adrian is the worst, he literally throws temper tantrums when he doesn't get his way and has sex with multiple girls in one morning. *rolls eyes* Paaaalease!  There is nothing sexy or encouraging or indearing about The Assistant. It sends the message that it's okay to be sexually harrased as long as your boss is hot and rich. Adrian treats Emily like crap and demands things of her that are highly inappropriate for a work relationship. The worst part was that Emily let him. I like a dominate man just like every other Jane Doe but this was just way over the top and not cute or indearing at all."}, {"userName": "Yasmine Jabado", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31399596-yasmine-jabado", "userReview": "Seriously one of the most awesome books ever.

Just don't.Point one. Characters are unrealistic and I'm pretty sure I was close to stabbing this story with Lorde's song Royals hoping it would start to make at least a little relation to me. Weight is not everything...thigh gaps aren't everything but apparently they are in this story since some of the girls act harshly towards Emily because of her figure, I'm not a big girl but I have a friend that is she is not judged for her figure or weight, she doesn't let men walk all over her. Ladies...This book objectified us in how many chapters? And for those people that somehow found this book awesome this is a review not a wedgie so don't get your knickers in a twist. No offence but I had to puke after reading this book but I held on, hoping 'cupcake' would grow a pair (metaphorically of course) because Adrian is just a controlling sadistic boss. Not to mention Emily is a push over who doesn't care where his penis has been and how many times its been put in how much nasty. Emily disgusts me quite frankly, her weak attributes...surprised she doesn't just walk around naked for how much she lets Adrian walk all over her, I hated it, plain and simple. I hope people read this review because this book sends a bad message...so moral is: Let your boss sleep with five hundred girls, let your best friend tell you your a idiot for quitting your job where all you do is cancel 'morning meetings' so your boss can screw those five hundred girls and otherwise let him marry you so he can probably cheat on you in the future with another five hundred girls...wow we're running out of girls aren't we?This is the message that should be heard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d3qX...Quote, \"Where is the power? Your mind your head, girls are confused that think it lies between your legs,\" I can't handle this book even the thought makes me cringe and wonder where feminine ire is...there are books being released with less and less strong female characters.It's saddening.I'm prepared for hate and I don't care because if people see this review it means they're actually reading it.I guess I am reviewing badly for this book but that's because I have a passion for what our future generations deserve to see, this is not one of them and so I've reacted harshly to how popular this book is and wonder if people are reading and comprehending what they see.

Jesus! there are so many ways she could have conveyed a character's facial expression or feelings other then 'smirk'. Second it was hard for me to believe the romance was real, Adrian was a arrogant big baby, and Emily was the weakest female character I've come across in a long time. Somehow the relationship happened and Emily was just riding along. SPOILERS. The kidnapping was just so weird, so you mean to tell me that Emily is soooo hot that a smart, wealthy business man kidnaps her. OKAYYYYYY. Mason is a pig and everyone finds it cute and funny even his wife. ALRIGHTTTTY. The best friend w/ the constant yelling. There are so many ways that excitement can be convyed w/out shouting.

I'm relatively new to Wattpad, The Assistant being the second book that I discovered. The description had me interested from the beginning, but after reading into the information and comments made on Wattpad, I discovered that this book had been picked up by a publisher. I'm all for seeing people succeed, so congratulations to the author. But, here is where I have such conflicting feelings about how to rate this book.1 (but not really). I'm not patient. I always check to make sure a book is completed before reading on Wattpad, but I was even more excited when I got to purchase this book for my Kindle. but that leads to #2...2. Even better, a book picked up by a publisher means a polished story... Or so you would think. My thoughts while reading this book were 'Did this book even go to an editor?' There were hundreds maybe even thousands of typos and grammar errors. I understand that this isn't an American author, so not everything is going to be the same, but I usually don't have to reread sections to try and figure out what words are missing. It was almost like reading a fill-in the blank book.3. How many times can a girl blush or stutter before its beyond annoying. For me, about 20% into the book. It was enough that I started replacing words in my head. A quick Kindle search for the word 'blush' came up with 150 results including, blush, blushing and blushed. I'm not sure if that is accurate, or if my Kindle just gave up and decided this girl blushes too damn much and stopped counting.Normally, I look past most of these details when it comes to self-published authors. If I'm hooked on a story or the characters, it doesn't ruin my reading experience. However, I do expect more out of publishers, there really is no excuse, to me. This is where the 1 star rating comes into play.I'm sure by now it seems as if I hated The Assistant, but I didn't. I actually loved this story. I love cheesy romance and over the top plots. It took me awhile to become invested in the characters, it least, Emily. And even then, she was just okay. My biggest problem with Emily was letting Adrian walk all over her. Even then, it was more like knock her down and run his car over her and back up and run her over again. You get the idea. Adrain is her boss, and I get that, but... Sheesh, the girl needs to blush less and stand up for herself. Emily wasn't a virgin, but she might as well be. It isn't until a bit into the story that we learn that she has in fact lost her v-card. What didn't work for me was the, 'I had sex once with my boyfriend, but he broke up with me when I told him I didn't want to do it again.' There was no real explanation as to why. About half way into the book things started looking up. Emily started being more assertive and I started liking her more, but by that time, there was no way to erase all the other negatives about her from my mind.Adrian. Hot, rich, British, alpha male and most times controlling asshole, Check, check, check and check. *sigh* Need I say more?Overall, I liked this book more than I was annoyed with few things mentioned above. I only recommend this book, if you enjoy over the top situations. Sleeping with multiple women, one after another, happens through a pretty big portion of this book, but if you can get past that, Adrian will make you fall in love with him in the end. Oh, and a future father-in-law that is obsessed with tits and ass, is disturbingly hilarious."}, {"userName": "Catriona Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22990893-catriona-laurie", "userReview": "If there was a negative star scale I would have given this book top marks. The Assisstant by Elle Brace is a book that, were Grammar Nazis in power, would have the author condemned to life imprisonment. My pet peeve (and the book is riddled with so many peeves) is the chronic overuse of the word 'smirk' - and by chronic I man apocaliptically so. Our hero's (and I use the word purely in its literary sense) incessant smirking is so good that he's apparently had it trademarked -- a fact we are bludgeoned with on every other page -- and gradually infects every other character in the book as it progresses, until it is rare for any character to do anything but smirk. In fact it is quite evident that the author has no idea what the word actually means, evidenced by the repeated use of the phrase 'smugly smirked'(hint: the two words basically mean the same thing). I'm more fluent in Oxford than American English but that aside there are some glaring gaffes when it comes to tenses. Here's a hint Ms Brace: It's probably easier to leave something in the past than the passed and don't get me started on the difference between two, too, and to! I think it would be fair to say that if the author has paid to have the novel professionally edited then she has been severely ripped off, and if she edited it herself then not only should she be ashamed but would be well served in investing in either a)a decent creative writing course, or, b) a reputable literary editing firm.Preferably both.Leaving aside the technical issues, the story itself is such that I have to question the gender of the author given its misogynistic overtones. The male lead, Aiden,the purported head of a multi-million dollar global empire is neither likeable nor relate-able. Indeed, real life would have such a sex-crazed, immature man slapped with so many sexual harassment lawsuits that his millions would be quickly swallowed by the judicial system. The female lead, Emily, sets the Women's Movement back decades as she puts up with indignities from the get-go that would have any self-respecting professional woman filing charges tout de suite. Her so-called best friend (a flimsy character at best) is no help as she encourages Emily to overlook her boss's childish temper and pysical liberties, labelling them as harmless signs of affection, totally justified since he is rich and handsome. Abused women everywhere would scream out at the actions of the characters in this truly bad novel. The ending, following as it was a truly farcical attempt at conflict, was akin to sitting through the endless epilogue scenes of The Lord of The Rings movies as the reader is slapped with epilogue after epilogue after epilogue when God! I just want it to be over! How many times do I have to endure demonstrations of how 'in love' this pair of deviants are, and, excuse me, but no woman wants to have sex after having been through that particular experience in epilogue #2. To summarise, The Assistant manages to hit the trifecta of literary awfulness: awful writing; awful characters; and awful plot - and for a bonus, hey, it's actually quite offensive too. It was like reading a car crash -- you know the sight is going to mentally scar you forever but you can't turn your head to not look. That can be my only excuse for reading all the way to the end. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go and bleach out my brain . . ."}, {"userName": "Jenni Jay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11245087-jenni-jay", "userReview": "I struggled reading this book. here's a list of things which made no sense to me: 1. who takes a job after being harassed during the interview? 2. who wants to be with a man who has sex an undetermined amount of women in the next room, all the while he's making passes at you? that's just desperate 3.

There's not enough money in the world to make me tolerate that.5. what was the master plan that Adrian was working on while Emily was going to the dinners with the creep? it was never revealed? or did I skim over it because I was so over the ridiculousness of this book 6. Why is the best friend a manager of Starbucks? If Allen and Adrian grew up together and Allen could afford to go to dinners where it's $2000 to get in, where is he making that kind of money? not at Starbucks 7.

The books was soooo off, humor was disconnected, heck the whole book was disconnected.

The hero reminded me of a toddler-tantrums (physical), poutings, unreasonable demands, and just plain immaturity that made me wonder if I would even let him run an ice cream stand let alone a billion dollar company. And of course, the heroine reminded me of his mother. I guess, that is the point of their romance, I don't know.

Yet this girl just puts up with it and then continues to put up with it throughout half the book (which is where I just stopped because OMG, what is this crap).Then you have her best friend pushing her and telling her she is an idiot when she finally does the right thing and guilt's her into going back. This is the most inaccurate portrayal of reality I've ever read. The fact that the boss has a harem of females that work in the marketing department that just parade through his office in the morning. WTF? I just can't even with this book.

She was way too clingy but the parts that really finished me off were the 'Smelly Emily' and 'Flakey Blakey', for God's sake these were people in their mid twenties going on like kids. Her parents couldn't resist telling her that she wasn't capable of living on her own at the age of 24(!), all because she couldn't fix a leaking tap...

I finally gave up and deleted the book after their first love scene. What love scene you ask? My point exactly, I thought the author would give us something a little steamy after all he's been coming onto her since the interview but no, it wasn't to be. they simply fell onto the bed then got up the next morning.

My favourite character would most likely be Adrian's father. I thought his character to be quite interesting and fun, a character that relieved any tension in the book. My thoughts on Emily was that she was determined as a character, but I really wished she could've kick Adrian's but at some point. But that would be against her, so of course that wasn't written in. Adrian was. . . Interesting. I had mixed feelings about him. Mainly positive. I thought that he was quite childish and attention seeking. But then again that's the entire point of this book.

LITTLE SPOILERS THOUGH. NOTHING MAJOR.I love Wattpad and there are some amazing books that deserves to be published, but this? This is disappointment.Let me tell you why:1) The author sounds like a 13 years old, if you read this book you'll understand exactly why. The phrases, the dialogues... Painful to read.2) Main guy is really really extremely creepy, stalkerish and asshole. Don't get me wrong, assholes&badboys are totally my type but this guy is in a whole another level.-EXEMPLE A: \"Cancel my morning schedules.\" sentence. The meaning is \"I won't do jackshit on my job(which I inherited from my father and to be completely honest I really wasn't doing anything lol long live the me)today, but instead I'm gonna bang the whole office in the bedroom that's attached to my office. -EXEMPLE B: \"You can't talk to any males.\" sentence. Okay haha I'm not even going to comment on this particularly phrase and scream bloody murder for this sexism but rather the things happened after that. So he went to the bathroom and a waiter approached her to take her order and he went batshit crazy. I mean, come on! Seriously? 3) That's classic and almost every book has that but then again, the author took this in a whole new level also: her self consciousness. She was all like \"I'm not pretty! I'm fat! Eww me!\" but everybody who saw her were falling in love with her at the drop of a hat and hitting on her. And in Wattpad the author casted her as Amber Heard, the hottest woman alive. I can totally go gay for her like seriously. I mean look at her:  It's just not realistic at all. 4) I'm trying to shut up but this is the last one: his ego as big as the Eiffel Tower. I can't give exemples for it, I'm sorry. Because then I'd have to copy-paste the whole book. So, officially this was the longest review I've ever wrote but since I looooooove Wattpad so much, I thought I owed it somehow. I tried to like this book so much but it's not working for me at all.

I had high hopes for this book and everytime it seemed to be turning a corner i got sucked back into disappointment.It wasnt all bad to be honest but there were a few things that just niggled me.Emily - When i first started reading i thought she was 20/21 fresh out of college but when her friend mentioned she was 24 i couldnt help but think her immature. She blushed far too much and called people idiot too much and my pet peeve....she constantly told people to shut up. SHe didnt come across and friendly, loving or polite when she interacted with Adrian and i wondered if she actually liked the guy then boom! she loves him with no real indication that she had a real hint of having real feelings for the guy. Adrian, I didnt like him being described as \"smirking\" 99% of the time. I thought he was a spoiled brat and proved it with all his tantrums. he had no manners what so ever and was just plain rude. I dont understand how he hasnt been done for sexual harassment at work in all the years he has been working, the guy was a pig at times and for Emily to just huff and puff at his behaviour. I dont understand how allen continued being friends with him after the stunts he pulled. i know guys can be easy going when it comes to their bro-mance but the dude was just ridiculous!The whole kidnapping thing was the most laughable part of the book.

Okay honestly I've finished this book for the sake of not disappointing myself for ever starting read this in the first place. I hate it when I started to read a story and in the middle it dragged down but I couldn't stop reading because I was curious of what's gonna happen with the characters in the end. But there was nothing to see in this story. I couldn't relate to all of the characters. All of them are too shallow and I couldn't even hear the pov of the main character because she failed to connect with the reader. I was totally disappointed with this book. At first, I expected a lot because Emily is no like Anna who agreed to have sex with Christian Grey because he's hot and she couldn't resist temptation. She played hard to get knowing that he's her boss and Adrian is the boss who has fucked a lot of girls before her. But that'ts it. I don't see any interesting in this story besides the fact that Adrian Kingston is a hot English man but hey he's no like Christian Grey. This book tried to be like another fifty shades in a less porno way. This story is to shallow. Even the problems weren't that complicated and whenever there's a conflict, it's reasolved easily as if it never existed. Take for instance David Walters kidnapping moment. It didn't make sense at all. And crap, Adrian Kingston is acting like a jealous prick the whole time. I couldn't help but praise Christian Grey's character more because at least, in his story, you can see his development as a character. That he has has become a strong character who has struggled to fight for his inner demons. This story failed to do that. It has failed to give the characters a life to stand on it's own. They're like a lifeless talking attractive flower in a bunch of dull other flowers. You'll pick it up because it appears to be beautiful but it'll immediately wilt and lose its beauty and essence.

Elle Brace used smirked after everything. EVERYONE in the book smirked ALL the time. Find a thesaurus, please!The title of this book should have been \"Smirked\". Would have been fitting.The rest of the review: All women in this book were doormats. He sexually harassed Emily constantly. It implied that he sexually harassed all his assistance. He had sex in his office with multiple partners whenever he was frustrated about anything. Including but not limited to his employees. It seemed like this book was written by a teen about other teens trying to play grown up.

The epilogue was really not necessary. It was unbelievably wrong in so manny ways... Even if Emily was born and raised Amish and dirt poor, she would stay away from all the nonsense Adrian is about. Spoiler alert- first he practically sexually assaults her the first time they meet- apparently he is 'sex' personified, because all women stop thinking when they see him and become sheep...- a normal business day of a billionaire and business mogul is canceling everything to have sex with women - one after the other! - she spends the night in his bed, with him in it, because she cannot find her house keys! The second week on the job...- he talks about getting her into his bed the whole time, also during work and uses his position as her boss - and she accept that- he decides that he wants her, so no other man can talk or look at her...- first she is fat, then she is every mans dream girl and the prettiest girl anyone has ever seen...- she is blackmailed by a rival business contact of Adrian to have dates with him....because he threatens the life of her best friend. She reacts by going along with him and go on dates with him....In the end this leads to nothing and he has to kidnap her.- Adrian's father keeps complimenting her on her big chest! En tries to hug her every time . He does this in front of Adrian and his own wife..- Adrian decides that she has to move in with him, so she does...The list goes on and on. Emily is a dum nitwit with no backbone and a more than stupid outlook in her choices. But apparently she is a brilliant assistant. At one point she is Adrian's right hand woman and had a deciding voice in the company...Truly a work of fiction. Do not read, because it takes a few days to force yourself to plough through this story.But if you do.....like me, keep your barf bucket handy.Note to the writer: the writing wasn't bad. But the nonsense story was tooooo long en unnecessary explicit. Yet I wanted to read to the end, just because I was wondering how predictable the story would be.

I sure hope it will be my last. I honestly do not know where to begin with this. There were too many name mistakes and mixups to count. The repetitiveness of the book was just way too much for anyone in general. I screamed a couple times when I read the word idiot because once the character Started saying that word it was constant and I just didn't want to read anymore but I did and I finished the book to the end but why I have no clue. The book started off really interesting but as time went on and keep on going in circles and circles it literally was driving me bonkers but I'm one that likes to finish a book and tries to give the author the benefit of the doubt but in this case there is no doubt my mind that this book wasn't a book for me. I understand where the author has gotten rave reviews on this book but these are mistakes that cannot be overlooked.Lastly when they finally do get to have sex don't bother even reading it because quite frankly It wasn't really there it was just boredom the book really bored me but like I said I finished the book and no matter how much I wanted to give this book at least three rating there just wasn't any way that was going to happen.This could've been a really great book to and it's a shame that I have to give the rating that I'm giving.I normally would say happy sexy reading but really don't bother with this."}, {"userName": "Mishra Shubhangee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55767030-mishra-shubhangee", "userReview": "This one is without a doubt the shittiest piece of crap i have ever read.
