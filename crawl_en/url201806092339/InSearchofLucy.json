Lucy Lang is not that woman, she\u2019s not even close. She\u2019s sad, damaged, broken. She has a life that she is not living. Every time she has opened her heart to someone, she gets hurt. At the beginning of the novel, we find Lucy in a dead end job in spite of having a love of art. She is a loner, a drunk. She doesn't have any friends and a list of regrets an arms length long. She was abandoned by the person she loved the most, her sister. She in alone. Thankfully there are a few people in her life who have not given up on her, two unlikely friends who join her on a life changing journey.I really enjoyed this novel. I loved following Lucy on her journey. I thought Ms. Fairfield did an excellent job adding realism to this novel. Lucy was the perfect balance of hope and despair. I enjoyed how she grew as a person, finding herself in the love and acceptance of others. I loved the relationships she had with her sister. I loved reading how their relationship evolved.

I have this unbridled passion for books, and the need to tell everyone about them, but from time to time I find myself at a loss. Not necessarily because the book was good or bad, but because it expresses something so much deeper than myself. \u201cIn Search of Lucy\u201d is a good example of one of those moments; that time in space when I feel like I\u2019ve stared at this blank page much longer than it took me to read the book, struggling to find the words. Then it hits me, or at least a quote from another book does and everything clicks.About 15 minutes ago, I was sitting in my car at a stop light, fuming from a (lets just say) less than pleasant day when the book I was listening to said something that caught my attention.\u201cSometimes, as people, we need to shatter so that the BETTER people in our lives can help glue us back together.\u201dOne sentence. It took Deb Caletti one sentence to express all of the sentiments that \u201cIn Search of Lucy\u201d possessed. \u201cThirty-year-old Lucy Lang\u2019s in freefall. Unfulfilled at work and abandoned by both her alcoholic mother and the sister she helped to raise, she\u2019s become cynical and depressed. Then, just as romance strikes, she finds out her sister needs a kidney transplant and only Lucy can help. Bolstered by new found friends, Lucy sets out on a road trip to save her sister\u2019s life and in the process, makes discoveries about the kind of person she truly is.\u201dI said about a month ago, (after reading \u201cFriends Like Us\u201d) that I was DONE with chick-lit. After being repeatedly disappointed I was going to take a stand and refuse to put myself through that sort of torture again. Apparently\u2026I am all talk, noooo follow-thru.A VERY long time ago (so sorry by the way) the lovely Ms. Lia Fairchild asked me to review her book, and because of horrible organizational skills (aka I accidentally deleted the email with the book when I was trying to clean my inbox) I never got around to it. So\u2026recognizing what an inexcusable mistake I had made I quickly scooted over to Amazon and purchased it.I\u2019m delighted that I did.While, (I\u2019ll admit) I\u2019m still a little concerned about \u201cchick-lit\u2019 and it\u2019s contribution to society in general\u2026\u201dIn Search of Lucy\u201d was NOT your normal chick-lit. Was there whining, drinking and the \u201coh so predictable\u201d bout of self-destruction? Yes\u2026that is very obviously a chick-lit standard, but Fairchild\u2019s ability to teach lessons of forgiveness, (both for others and yourself) is what REALLY drove this book.In short\u2026 Lucy is a flat out disaster. She has issues with her past that dictate her future, and though she doesn\u2019t recognize it in herself, (initially) she is slowly becoming the part of her \u201cpast\u201d that she despised to begin with. She cuts off her nose to spite her face on several occasions, and she absolutely refuses help from the people around her, (who she basically views as \u201cprops\u201d in her cracking planet.) But when her sister get\u2019s sick, and she has no choice but to accept help, (graciously or not) she starts to recognize that SHE has created her own prison, not her family.This book follows Lucy\u2019s journey back to HERSELF. It\u2019s not just about romance, and a sisters fight for life. It\u2019s about acceptance of what was, what is, and what will be. And\u2026 more importantly, (unlike most chick lit) it has a very defined, finite ending. Goodby guesswork!Now, while I can\u2019t necessarily recommend this book to everyone, I will say that\u2026in regards to chick-lit, (on this ONE occasion) I have been proven wrong. If you enjoy the trials of self-discovery and all that that involves\u2026chances are you will like this. If you are an action nut or a flat out \u201cromance\u201d fiend\u2026 pass.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: Forgiveness is a virtue of the brave. A lesson I myself would do well to remember."}, {"userName": "Shanna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029720-shanna", "userReview": "Lucy Lang has spent her entire life struggling...struggling to compensate for her alcoholic mother Linda, struggling to care for her younger sister Katie, and even struggling to find who she is and where her place is in the world.

There are things that happen everyday to so many people that somehow usually never get discussed openly.

Her mother reacts badly by turning to one-night stands and alcohol. Lucy becomes the lynchpin of the family having to be mother to her half-sister and having to control the downward spiral her own mother is pursuing. Lucy has to grow up way before her time and sacrifice not only her college education, but her own childhood and teen years. Eventually, her mother decides she cannot cope with life as it is and abandons them and her half-sister opts for a life with her boyfriend; it is 6 years before the two are to meet again when Lucy discovers she could be the one person to save the life of her beloved, now seriously ill half-sister.

Within the first few chapters I found myself attached to Lucy and the other characters.After an extremely difficult young life where she had to deal with her alcoholic mother, the death of her step-father, and taking care of her little sister, Lucy has built up a huge protective wall around her. Not wanting to let anyone in, she has been alone for far to long and is thinking about just ending it all. Instead, she finds herself on an emotional and physical journey that will forever change her life.Lucy's little sister needs a kidney transplant and out of everyone who is tested, only Lucy is a match. Even though she hasn't seen or even talked to Katie in years, there is still nothing Lucy wouldn't do to help her. Except fly. Luckily Benny; one of her neighbors, volunteers to drive her to her sisters, and Amy volunteers to be a support for her.This surprises Lucy because she never really considered the two as real friends. And after just one botched date, she never even thought that someone like Kyle could ever really be interested in her.All that changes however as Lucy finds that not only is life not that bad, but that she is truly worthy of being loved by others and ultimately loved by herself, and by the end of the story she is finally ready to LIVE.Even though the copy I received was reedited, there were still a handful of mistakes. Still, I found In Search of Lucy a really good read. The story is amazingly believable and may even bring a tear to your eyes.

She lives alone, has had a rough upbringing and mainly just goes to work and home. She is struggling internally and not too willing to let people in. I can related in some ways to Lucy because I am also a loner, but thankfully I have a relationship with my family.I love how Lia Fairchild slowly introduced some friendships into Lucy\u2019s world. Meeting new people, or even accepting people you already know can be a tough thing to do when you are used to solitude. Benny and Anne proved to be great friends to Lucy and she was so lucky to have them. Kyle turned out to be great in the end, but I wasn\u2019t sure where Ms. Fairchild was going with his character. I thought maybe he was going to be a dark cloud on the story, but he turned out to be another wonderful addition to Lucy\u2019s life.I found the dynamic between Lucy and Katie to be quite interesting. Katie left in such a hurtful way and it was so amazing to me that Lucy was able to forgive her. Can I just say that Katie really has her act together for a 24 year old - did we ever learn what either Katie or Rick did for a living to own such a nice house at such a young age? Lucy was such a well-written character. She was able to grow as a person in such a short span of time and it was believable given her circumstances. When the book first began, I was not sure I was going to like Lucy but I became quite fond of her and just wanted her to have a happy life.In Search of Lucy packs an emotional, yet realistic punch that portrays a broken family dynamic trying to heal.

There is someone in the line up of \"cast\" that everyone can relate too. The story line, is actually one that is not unheard of these days. With all the \"broken\" homes, I'm sure this story line is played out across America every single day. Lucy, who at a young age has to become the mother figure for a younger sibling . . get's her feelings hurt when the little sister grows up and no longer \"needs\" her. Keeping her true feelings inside, for so long, Lucy begins to shut down to the world around her. Lucy begins to feel cheated and used, like she is no longer of use to anyone. Her life becomes one of avoiding others and hardly ever stepping outside that of a daily routine. Not wanting to rely on anyone Lucy must step out of her comfort zone, when she discovers her only sister, the one who hurt her so badly, needs her like never before.

I believe I have it on my Kindle because it was probably a free one and the description sounded decent enough. And it was decent enough but it didn't really wow me. Lucy is a single young woman who has had enough trauma in her life that she relies a little too much on alcohol to help get her through rough spots. She's also had enough trauma that she doesn't trust anyone so she's totally isolated herself. She has some fringe friends - people on the fringes of her life - but nobody she can rely on. Or so she thinks. A phone call from her brother-in-law changes all that and she sets out to help her baby sister with two \"fringe\" friends tagging along and a boy who is pursuing her in the background. During their journey toward her sister Lucy discovers many things about herself and allows her perspective on past events to be brought into a better light. In the end will Lucy be able to knock down her walls and let people in? She's searching for who she really is. Fairchild's book holds potential but she falls flat on a few levels. Her character development feels stunted, her story line is a little weak, and the conflicts she includes in the book don't quite pack the punch I am sure she was hoping for.

The reader will feel empathy towards Ms Fairchild's characters enabling the reader to be sufficiently interested in what is going to happen next and together with Ms Fairchild's descriptive language I found each scene to be quite vivid. I recommend this book as a really good read; especially if you like what is essentially a pretty graphic rite of passage. `In Search of Lucy' has all the best elements - love, a serious illness and a road to recovery where Lucy climbs out of the pit of her despair and repairs her own fragile life, finding love in the end."}, {"userName": "Meg - A Bookish Affair", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132408-meg---a-bookish-affair", "userReview": "Lucy feels like she's going nowhere.

It was very easy to see where Lucy was coming from. Although Lucy's feelings are extreme, I think most everyone has felt some sort of infinite sadness at some point in their life. It does seem to take Lucy an awful long time to rise above all of the bad feelings that she has about her life. I thought that the author did a really good job with making the characters accessible. You feel like they could be people that you could meet or have met. I definitely think that the book would have benefitted from a little more showing and not so much telling. A lot of the pleasure in reading for me is being able to put together the pieces in the story. It's already done for you with so much telling. It sort of took away from that initial aspect of being able to \"meet\" the characters under your own terms.This is definitely a good book about finding your way back and finding redemption. It's also a good book about allowing yourself to love and being loved in return. For Lucy, those lessons are definitely hard won.

Life was very difficult for the girls but while Katie grew up quite well adjusted and was able to meet someone and fall in love, things were not so easy for Lucy. Choosing to stay home to take care of Katie over going to college meant Lucy wasn\u2019t able to fulfil her dreams so when Katie fell pregnant and moved away with her boyfriend Lucy was deeply hurt. The sisters didn\u2019t speak for almost five years until Katie became ill and needed Lucy\u2019s help.Lucy was a likable and believable character who sometimes made silly choices and was most definitely not perfect. She had built a protective wall around herself, not letting anyone in and hating to ask for help. I could totally understand why she had that attitude, her start in life was really shitty, too many responsibilities too young made her have to grow up before her time. Of course it would mess with your head!!

Granted, our heroine here is the ripe old age of 30. But with a childhood as difficult as hers (an alcoholic mother, missing father, deceased step-father, etc.), Lucy had to grow up fast and thus, it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019d wind up in such a downward spiral at her age. It\u2019s too much to ask for one woman to handle.But handle it, Lucy does. And in handling things, she also formed a very maternal relationship with her younger sister Katie, who grew up and basically abandoned her to live her own life. When it turns out that Katie now needs Lucy in her life again (in a big, bad way, too), what will the trusty older sister do?In Fairchild\u2019s debut novel, Lucy is a sympathetic main character who brings you on a journey of growth and development right along with her. On the way to help save her sister\u2019s life in Texas, Lucy learns a lot about herself, some new friends, and a budding relationship she left behind her in LA. What unfolds is organic, honest, and very compelling.Read the full review at Love on the Bookshelf: http://loveonthebookshelf.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Read, Run, Ramble", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2251932-read-run-ramble", "userReview": "Lucy Lang has experienced horrible times and as a result has had a hard time of \"finding\" herself as an adult - thus \"In Search of Lucy\". I found I could relate with Lucy - we all struggle with our pasts at some point in time and we all have trouble moving past the events that hold us down occasionally.Fairchild developed a main character that readers will want to know about - they'll want to know about her and her supporting cast. There were many likable people in the book. My favorite is Carly (she's much like my own daughter who surrounds herself in stuffed animals AND has a \"Bun Bun\").In the name of full disclosure, I'll mention that I picked up on some editing issues - misspellings, typos, and the such, but it never removed my focus and certainly didn't distract me from the story or make me dislike the book. Additionally, I would have loved a little more development in plot/characters toward the end of the novel. At some point it just seemed a little rushed.In Search of Lucy will pull readers in, will make readers cry, smile and laugh, and make them want to see Lucy through the entire story (not to mention give her a big hug)."}, {"userName": "Karen Williams", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2443256-karen-williams", "userReview": "I really liked this book. I thought it was well written and the characters were very likable and I was able to relate to their situation. It really made me think that if something happened to my sister would I be willing to give her a kidney, no questions asked. And my answer is: I'm not sure. We don't get along, we haven't gotten along for a very long time. Probably 25 years or so, we haven't seen eye to eye. She has made some very poor decisions in her life that I can't support and I really struggled with this question. Could I give my kidney to her?? It made me wonder if she would do the same for me, and my answer is \"I don't know.\" I really hope I don't ever need to know the answer to that question. I really, truly liked this story and I had to think about my review for awhile. I love books that touch me in a personal way and makes me think about my own life and existence. I will probably struggle with this question of giving my kidney to my sister for a long while, but hopefully I will never have to face it head on. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.

She raised Katie protected and mothered here over the years but Katie left for her own family life in Texas and left Lucy behind.

She had no education nothing but memories of her sister and the pain of her childhood to keep her company. Lucy lives in limbo suffering the sins of the past. Her estranged sister Katie calls her to ask the ultimate sacrifice she needs Lucy to save her again by giving her a kidney. This book is rich with feeling as the author takes you on Lucy\u2019s journey of ups and downs to find herself and learn to move on from the past that holds her back. I enjoyed this book so much.

Well, this is not one of them. It is one of those who you read at ease but looking forward to return to.I was intrigued by how the author would balance the main character's ambivalence towards her sister, who physically needed her, and the physiological and psychological requirements to be a live organ donor. My opinion is that Ms. Fairchild worked it out well enough; though, in real life the dynamics of organ donation is not as flexible.The parallel love story was enjoyable and believable, as well as the real support from friends. I would set this novel as a psychological thriller, adding organ donations as tags.A bit of re-editing to correct minor details such as \"altar\" rather than \"alter,\" \"giver her 'a' call\" rather than \"give her call\" would be worthwhile. And there are a few acronyms that were not explained, such as ADHD\u2026I look forward to reading more by Ms. Fairchild."}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5460575-gina", "userReview": "This is the story of Lucy who has lived her life with no real meaning. When she was young she was often left alone to care for her younger sister Kate due to their mother's alcoholism. Now as adults Lucy feels alone, out of touch, and doesn't have a life filled with friends and family, both of which she craves. Out of the blue, Lucy is contacted by her sister because Kate is sick and needs a kidney donation. The only one left who can possible save her is Lucy. During the process of Lucy reuniting with her sister she finally works out in her head what she needs. She needs to live her life in the present and let go of her past.Based on the description, the book sounds like it could be promising. However, it was a huge letdown. The entire novel is very flat. The author just tells the story. There is no depth or character development. I didn't ever feel like I cared about any character in the book. This book fell really flat, which is a shame because the author could have done so much more with the story if her writing style was more mature. 2 stars."}, {"userName": "Marilou George", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7034047-marilou-george", "userReview": "In Search Of Lucy is a heartfelt tale of two sisters with a bond that can't be broken no matter how much time has passed or how the past has shaped their lives.Lucy, the older sister, travels down a path that leaves her lonely and broken.

I was very impressed with her descriptions, her voice, and the ease with which she has written this book. I think that she is a very good author, and I would be very receptive to reading her works in the future.After saying that, I felt that I was unable to emotionally connect with the character of Lucy in the story. I think that Lucy is a much darker person that I am, and I had a hard time connecting with her. I try to look at the positive's in life, and try to stay away from people that wallow in their pasts. I wonder if the author wrote this story in the first person viewpoint, if I would have been able to connect more with Lucy in the story."}], "description": "Lucy Lang's life is spiraling out of control.
