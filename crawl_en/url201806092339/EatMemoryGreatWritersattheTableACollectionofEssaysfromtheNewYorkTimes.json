Some of these essays stand nicely on their own but many are forgettable, and as a collection this is a waste of paper. A transparent attempt to milk some extra money out of a perfectly nice column in the NYT. It barely cracks 200 pages, and has literally an extra inch of right margin space. Every essay is followed by one of those frivolous tie-in recipes no one ever makes. One of these \"essays\" is just a reprinted excerpt from a Julia Child's My Life in France! And several others I'd already read in other collections. AND FINALLY these essays claim to avoid the sentimental, but if I have to suffer through another reference to Proust or his godforsaken cookies in foodwriting, I won't be held accountable for my actions."}, {"userName": "Rowan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27210353-rowan", "userReview": "Good, but limited by short article format."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137566-kate", "userReview": "A lot of these essays seem only to scratch the surface.

There were Jews cooking the passover meal in Berlin, a brother cooking comfort food for his Autistic sister on their birthday, Indian's trying their best to introduce their families to the delicate French cuisine, an ode to garlic, and one to gravy, and gripes by those who don't love food about people forcing them to eat desserts.The great variety of stories lent itself to a very interesting read. These acclaimed writers, with their wide swath of life experiences, were able to paint pictures that made your mouths water. Not to mention the stories are accompanied by the relevant recipes, so that we can cook similar delicious morsels at home.Rather than just be a book of people describing a meal that they've eaten, this book cleverly is more about the strong emotions that can be attached to something as simple as a meal. That feeling is something everyone can relate to, and reading the anecdotes triggers memories of the reader's own memorable meals.This book isn't very long, and each individual essay only spans a few pages, so it's a great book for food-lovers with not much time on their hands. Definitely worth a look."}, {"userName": "Eliza", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3490134-eliza", "userReview": "2/15/12: This is a collection--\"Best of\", I'd guess--of short essays written for the \"Eat, Memory\" column in the New York Times Magazine. Edited by Amanda Hesser (who also edited the column while it ran), it covers a wide range of authors and topics, though all focus on the theme of memories and food. A quick read, but there are some lovely surprises in here; it is amazing how evocative smell and taste can be, bringing to mind memories of place and time and family. Just as Proust tells us! Also, it's interesting how often a sense of loss pervades these essays: loss of innocence, of loved ones, of appetites, of a taste for ice cream\u2026. So it's particularly helpful to read these essays all together; it's easier to note their similarities, their common tendency to make food into something intensely meaningful. I suppose Duh, that was the whole idea of the assignment--but often an assignment is easier said than done, and these essays about the authors' experiences succeed in their mission. The best ones manage to be both personal and universal--the best kind of personal essay."}, {"userName": "Catherine Woodman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912889-catherine-woodman", "userReview": "I recieved this book from some great friends, who are as food oriented as we are, and I had not heard of it, so always nice to be given soemthing that is perfect for you that you were unaware of. This is a collection of essays by people who write, and very generally they are about food or the experience around food. I really liked some of them (the blind grill chef, Kiran Desai talking about her growing up experiece to name a couple), and perhaps best of all, it made me think seriously about writing about some of my most memorable food experiences--a signature dish piece, a reflection on what my children crave when they are no longer at home full time, the experience of holiday and food, the community experience of sharing meals. So while this is not great literature, it is enjoyable, and most importantly it gave me something to think about that goes far beyond the experience of merely reading it."}, {"userName": "Purlewe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2117145-purlewe", "userReview": "I love essays. And if you want to read fantastic essays, get a bunch from the times and put them in a book! I am in awe of Amanda Hesser and her ideas. Food writing that is not odes to grandmother's cooking, but instead essays about why grandmother cooked. I loved reading this on the subway as they were just the right length between work and home. She chose talented writers, playwrights, and poets to render memories into delectable bites.My favorites were: The Great Carrot Caper, The Absolutely No-Anything Diet, Home Turf, Line of Sight, Turning Japanese, and Crossing to Safety. Altho really.. none of these stories were bad.. I love stories about tastes in other countries, how someone found a recipe, working thru your grief thru cooking. All of these appeal to me.

I did not think this an appropriate pick for youngsters but my father in law insisted. As we strolled in past candlelit tables filled with couples, I thought oh this is not a family establishment by any stretch. By the end of our 3 hour meal though, we were unaware of anyone else in the place. The meal was amazing and Grandpa made sure that his grandkids had whatever they needed including playing hand slapping games with loads of laughter. The head chef even joined our table for a while. I remember how scrumptious the food was but realize it was the company that made it so. This memory was what made me want to read this book.
