The expected publication date is November 10th, 2015** Although part of a series this can be read as a stand alone. I have not read any of the others and it in no way impacted this story other than mentioning some character which I am assuming were introduced in previous stories. This is a short novella which I believe was to add some additional storylines for some of these characters. If you enjoy stories that deal with couple that always wondered what could have been and then have the opportunity to find out then this is the story for you. It shows how time does not necessarily change feelings. I really enjoyed how the couple proceeded with caution once they were able to connect again. This story moves very fast and sometimes seemed a little over the top (Sophie's ex) however still gave that taste of romance one is seeking. Also, the story is relatively clean for those who prefer the storyline a little less steamy. It does have sexual content however Brannagh leaves it for the imagination mostly without going in to graphic detail. This was a little bit refreshing. Due to the short length I can't disclose anymore however I can say I really wish I knew this football team. It seems like a great group of guys to spend some Saturday afternoons reading about.

It is a Novella. It is the story of Kyle Carson and Sophie Hayes. Kyle is a wide receiver for the Seattle Sharks team. He wants to escape from his busy life and goes to Noel, Washington. It is the perfect place for him to go. He is trying to relax and figure out what he wants to do. He gets a big surprise, though, when he goes to the local grocery store. Sophie is working at a small town grocery store in Noel, Washington. She has fled her native Florida because of problems with an ex. She feels safe with her quiet routine in the mountain town. When Kyle walks back into her life, she remembers how she always had a thing for him growing up. She knows he is a tie to her old life in Florida. If Sophie wants to try to see where things go with Kyle, she will have to decide if she can stay and fight for him, or leave once again. Maybe with the help of some of his teammates, they can get the life and love they have both found with each other. Really cute story. I love how they find shelter in each other. I love how they work out a plan to get the better of Sophie's ex, who just won't go away, even with a protective order.

I am normally not a fan of novellas, but the character development in this book was pretty good and the fact that our hero and heroine knew each other going in made the whole thing just work all the better. This book is in the middle of the series, but I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything by not knowing some of the secondary characters as well as I would have if I had read the other books. So when the book starts we meet both Sophie and Kyle who are both going through some hard times in their lives. Sophie has left all her family behind and started over from scratch after leaving behind an abusive and slightly crazy ex-boyfriend. She goes from being a school teacher with strong connections to her family, to living in someones mother in law suite in a tiny town across the country from her family and is now working at a grocery store. What I liked the best about Sophie is she doesn't spend a lot of time feeling sorry for herself, which frankly anyone would understand if she had. She's a strong girl, she stood up for herself, she made a new life for herself, and she didn't let herself become a shell of who she used to be. Sophie is someone I would love to be friends with. Kyle is a guy Sophie knew from high school, and he has definitely made good on his life, becoming a professional athlete. But Kyle just wants to get away, which is how he ends up with a cabin in a small town. I felt for Kyle, who basically just wanted to be a good guy, good friend, good teammate, good son. But his family, and his so called friends, were basically bleeding him dry. I mean to the point where when he tries to get away from them they hire a kind of skeezy private investigator to track him down so their money trail doesn't dry off. Kyle is such a good guy, and when he sees Sophie after all these years, well the chance to get the girl who got away is one he can't pass up; and he is going to protect Sophie no matter what. There were parts of this novella that were suspenseful, but over all this whole book was just super sweet. I wanted Kyle and Sophie to work out right from the start, they are just two really nice people who have great chemistry together. If you are looking for a feel good novella then this is definitely a good choice."}, {"userName": "Mel (Reviews In A Pinch)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28571496-mel-reviews-in-a-pinch", "userReview": "Full Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.My Thoughts: As many of you are aware, I have been on one heck of a contemporary romance kick lately. I saw the synopsis for Guarding Sophie and wanted to give it a try. I liked the idea that the two main characters already knew each other years before. I thought it might be a slight change of pace.After I requested it, I realized I actually had a copy of 2 other books in this series. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t really have to read this series in order. I think there\u2019s a slight advantage because characters from the other books are mentioned, but it\u2019s not necessary.The chemistry between Sophie and Kyle was almost non-existent for me. It was like you were supposed to take the author\u2019s word for it that there was chemistry because the characters had a history. I definitely felt like I was being told there was chemistry rather than shown, which is not enjoyable in a book.Neither character was particularly engaging or exciting to read about. They weren\u2019t fleshed out; you just had to take a lot at face value. Part of the blame for that has to fall on it being a short story. There was too much that could\u2019ve been added, but would\u2019ve ultimately made Guarding Sophie a novel.To that end, Guarding Sophie had an awfully in-depth story line for a short story. Unfortunately because of that it felt rushed and not at all realistic. This would\u2019ve made an interesting full length novel.So far, I feel like I\u2019ve mostly been negative which gives you a lopsided review. I did actually like Guarding Sophie. Sophie and Kyle each had good qualities, they were just overshadowed by everything else that was going on. The references to other players and couples from previous books would\u2019ve been more enjoyable for me had I actually read those books.Overall, I wasn\u2019t impressed. It doesn\u2019t dim my interest in the rest of the series, but I\u2019m almost positive I would\u2019ve enjoyed Guarding Sophie a little more if I\u2019d read the other books first. In a sense, I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s my own fault here, not the author\u2019s. I would recommend Guarding Sophie, if you\u2019ve already read something in the Love and Football series.For more reviews, check out Reviews In A Pinch today!"}, {"userName": "Misty (Red's Romance Review's)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40488043-misty-red-s-romance-review-s", "userReview": "Kyle Larson is looking forward to his off season and having the opportunity to escape the limelight and his money hungry relatives for a while.

He has come to a point in his career where he needs to make a plan for his future, and put down roots some where, and he is hoping Noel will be the place he can do that. When he decides to take in the sights of Noel and do a little site seeing and shopping he gets the surprise of his life... the woman who stole his heart years ago has recently also taken residence in the town of Noel.

Leaving her family behind, and going on the run was the hardest thing she has ever had to do, but she figured it was the only way she could protect herself from her dangerous ex. For the first time in quite a while she is able to carry on with her day without having to constantly look over her shoulder, and she is actually starting to enjoy her new life in Noel, especially when a certain handsome football walks back into her life...I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent reading this short, but oh so sweet, story. Ms. Brannagh never ceases to amaze me with her brilliant and heartfelt story lines. I truly enjoyed watching Sophie and Kyle's story unfold, it was sweet,captivating,thrilling and packed with lots of steamy passion.

Guarding Sophie was a quick story that is full of heart and a second chance. I love sports romances and this book has a hint of the football limelight and one of my favorite themes, a second chance to make it right. Julie Brannagh does a great job of giving us a story that is heartfelt and feels like there is more depth than you would anticipate. With a novella, there is always a chance that it will have gaping holes and be a small taste and not satisfying. With Guarding Sophie, the history that these two characters have and the situations that they encounter allow for the story to be bigger than it's novella status. There is history between Sophie and Kyle, which allows them to jump into the romance without feeling too rushed (despite the inevitable insta-love theme). Sophie's situation is something that is unfortunately very common in life, so that theme does not require tons of development. The reader is able to build an entire backstory from the glimpses given. It is what it is and after a bit of history, you have the depth you need. I have not read anything from the Love and Football series before. This novella gives you a taste of the series without bombarding you with too many people and plotlines. You meet Kyle's teamates in this story, and the rest of the series is obviously about their HEAs, yet you never really feel lacking. It feels like you are thrown into a reunion of friends where you only know one person but they draw you in and make you feel welcome. This story is sweet, romantic, with a bit of danger and intriguing thrown in. This series from Julie Brannagh has been added to the TBR list and I am excited to see more of the stories we have glimpses of in this novella."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3085379-danielle", "userReview": "I really do love this series and the characters. It took me a while to catch up on all the books but I am so glad I did. The story of Kyle and Sophie is a novella but I have to say I wish it would have been a full length novel. Sophie was in an abusive relationship and had to disappear. She ended up in Noel, Washington 3 months ago and it's starting to feel like home. While working in the grocery store she runs into Kyle who she hasn't seen in 10 years but she is scared to catch up with him in fear that her ex will find her. Kyle is a successful player on the field and has the money to show for it. He's heard about other players getting taken advantage of by family and friends but he never expected it to happen to him. Now he has bought a new place in Noel and is working on cutting people loose. I really liked that Sophie and Kyle had the connection of them going to high school together and they weren't just thrown together in a story. Kyle had a crush on her in High school which was cute.These two both opened up to one another about the issues they were having and they wanted to work through them together. Kyle was patient and very understanding, by him taking things slow with her won me over. One of my favorite parts is when his team and their significant other get together. They are just one big happy family and the way they wanted to help Sophie was extra special. I did think that there could have been more to this book and I truly would have wanted more. At about 75% the book was over and left the remaining with samples of the previous books in the series. I just wish there was more to this story and it didn't feel so rushed.

They are really easy to like and relate to, and even the biggest football players are so down to earth, not to mention care for each other. Truly a family.The author paints a clear picture of the events, elements, and surroundings. It is easy to set yourself into the story, and let it flow on. Kyle and Sophie had a crush on each other in high school, but life happened, and for ten years, they hadn't seen each other. Now, when they both are in hiding for different reasons, they find the refuge and comfort within each other. The attraction they had for each other grows into something much more, something solid and lasting.The elements of danger from Sophie's ex, Peter, gives another dimension to the story. The domestic abuse is handled with respect to the victim. Even though the story is short in length, you can see the characters grow and develop, Kyle with his ungrateful family, and Sophie comes to a place where she can face her attacker. I enjoyed the story, it is easy to submerge into the world of the tale, and forget the rest of the world with its worries, so if you are looking for a little sweet escape, this would be a perfect story for that~ Four Spoons"}, {"userName": "Heather Major", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40181607-heather-major", "userReview": "This short novella is a lovely addition to Julie's A Love and Football series!Sophia Hayes moved to Noel in search of a new life.

We have two people that are hiding out. Kyle who is hiding out from his money grubbing family. He's just tired of them begging money, because he's a famous football player. Yep, that can get old after awhile. So, in a way he went underground. Not really, but you get the gist. We also have Sophie who had to runaway of her old life cause of psycho ex-boyfriend. Aren't they the fun ones, not. Kyle and Sophie knew each other back in high school, and they get a chance to reconnect during Guarding Sophie. Anyway, this story was a quick little read that could have been a lot longer, but it's a novella. It's fine as a novella, because both of these characters were able to find resolutions for their problems while finding love. YAY! It shows that the Sharks will stick together no matter what on or off the field. So, if you are looking for a quick read with a football player who gets a second chance to go out with a high school crush while being a hero, you have met your match in Guarding Sophie.
