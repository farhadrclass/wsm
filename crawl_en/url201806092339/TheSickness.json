But mostly it is about sickness. The novel concerns a perfectly healthy man convinced he is gravely ill and a very sick man who doesn\u2019t know he has terminal cancer because his own son and doctor cannot bring himself to break the news.Dr Miranda is a believer in telling the truth, whole truth and nothing but the truth. He has always advocated a no-nonsense approach towards the patients and has never had any difficulties \u2013 until now, when the patient is his father and he has to tell him he only has a few weeks to live.Meanwhile in the background, another patient of his, Ernesto Dur\u00e1n, is convinced he is dying and resorts to stalking his doctor who ignores him and his pleas. Dr Miranda\u2019s secretary using her boss\u2019s absent-mindedness passes herself off as her boss and engages in email correspondence with Dur\u00e1n. It soon metamorphoses itself from an innocent pastime into a dangerous sickness as well. While Dr Miranda is trying to find the right words to say to his father, his patient and his secretary are slowly going mad.You might argue that 150 pages is not quite enough to tackle such a difficult subject as life, sickness and death. And you might also argue that a couple of months isn\u2019t enough to come to terms with our own mortality. Sadly, sometimes it\u2019s all we are going to be given. Death won\u2019t wait until we are ready and the book\u2019s brevity could easily be interpreted as a symbol of our fleeting nature.Alberto Barrera Tyszka made the best of his 150 pages partly thanks to his knack for saying what\u2019s important in little quips like this one:\u201cBlood is a terrible gossip, it tells everything\u201dIt is also clear that he has done his homework and read everything that was produced on the subject of sickness in the history of the written word. And he wants you to know it, so the book is peppered with clumsy interjections such as:\u201cPerhaps he\u2018s remembering that novel by Louis Ferdinand C\u00e9line, in which a doctor \u2018described illness as he would describe a face of an old acquaintance\u2019. That is what weighs on Andr\u00e9s now.\u201dThis is really the only fault of this otherwise good novel which meanders slowly around the events. Suspense has been sacrificed to sadness and the melancholy of things calmly burning out.It should be a compulsory read on the subject which is becoming more and more intimidating and difficult to deal with within our society.(originally published on bookmunch.wordpress.com)"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy", "userReview": "Translated from the Spanish by Margaret Jull Costa\"Tears are very unliterary: they have no form.\"This is possibly the most dog-eared book I've ever had. Folding down corners is my method for marking significant (to me) passages, but it clearly wasn't working with this fiction novel because I was marking every page. I'd never read this Venezuelan author before, but I hope to find more of his work translated into English.Delicate prose, deep moral questions, and a stunning pace are what kept me hooked into reading this in one sitting. The story itself is rather simple: a successful doctor discovers that his father is seriously ill. Their close relationship is strained as the son weighs the consequences of telling his father the details of his illness. In the meantime, another man, virtually unknown to the doctor, begins stalking him, imagining that he holds the cure for the the list of complaints he suffers from. There's a push and pull to the narrative, as the poignant moments between father and son,nuanced with shared memories of grief, intertwine with the creepy certainty of the stalker. Because of the health issues that permeate the novel, questions about the nature of health and wellness are explored, but in a brief, compelling way. The author cites quotes of famous authors, ethicists and physicians, but he's not showing off, they are actually appropriate observations of how the human body deals with illness. These asides never go too long or feel like a lecture, they fit the material in the most uncanny way.For example, Tyszka quotes Julio Ramon Ribeyro, who provides possibly the best explanation for the euphoria that exists after an episode of physical pain:\"Physical pain is the great regulator of our passions and ambitions. Its presence immediately neutralizes all other desires apart from the desire for the pain to go away. This life that we reject because it seems to us boring, unfair, mediocre or absurd suddenly seems priceless: we accept it as it is, with all its defects, as long as it doesn't present itself to us in its vilest form - pain.\"Tsyzka presents simple scenes with insightful observation. On trying to read the face of a doctor while awaiting possibly bad news:\"It's the illustration that accompanies a bad diagnosis, the first installment of an expression of condolence.\"On imagining his father's worries:\"Are the monsters of old age as terrible as those that assail us when we're children? What do you dream about when you're sixty-nine? ....Perhaps this is what his father dreams about: he's in a laboratory, in the bowels of a hospital, surrounded by chemicals, sharp implements, gauze, and strangers all repellently dressed in white....\"Events proceed in unexpected ways, and as a reader, you never quite know what direction you're being pulled in. You feel empathy and disgust in altering passages, and the underlying fear is riveting. I did find the ending a bit confusing...I still am not sure I've understood all the implications laid out.One scene confounds me: It takes place on a ferry, where an obnoxious businessman makes a production of his 'importance' and maltreats his seemingly intelligent and kind wife, all the way to the point of beating her to the ground. I'm not sure what the symbolism is, although I know it's present in that scene. Is Tyszka trying to say that people are subject to humiliation, by oppression or illness, no matter how virtuous they are? In full, this is easily going to be in my list of favorites for the year. While the subject revolves around illness, it never quite defines which 'illness' is being addressed: is it disease? regret? evil? The questions are posed, and only each individual reader can answer."}, {"userName": "Bernardo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4980164-bernardo", "userReview": "Lo termin\u00e9 en la playa.

La m\u00e1s perversa de todas las utop\u00edas.Quiz\u00e1s no represente una idea nueva ni la mejor novela del mundo, pero La enfermedad, de que es buena, es buena. Toc\u00f3 algo en m\u00ed, as\u00ed que mi comentario es bastante emocional.Con la enfermedad se representan un mont\u00f3n de cosas: la muerte, la soledad, el amor, el vac\u00edo. Andr\u00e9s Miranda es m\u00e9dico y sabe que su pap\u00e1 tiene c\u00e1ncer. Se est\u00e1 muriendo, est\u00e1 en estado 4. S\u00f3lo queda esperar lo peor y recordar la vida que su viejo le pudo ofrecer como hombre viudo. La novela se divide en dos: la parte donde Javier Miranda no sabe que tiene c\u00e1ncer y la otra parte donde ya se siente desahuciado. La enfermedad congela todo: conversaciones, sue\u00f1os, deseos, relaciones. Andr\u00e9s no puede hacer nada, s\u00f3lo recordar lo bueno y lo malo de su relaci\u00f3n padre-hijo. La otra enfermedad, la de Ernesto Dur\u00e1n, es simplemente un vac\u00edo existencial. Aunque tenga s\u00edntomas f\u00edsicos, lo peor es que sus descompensamientos son por ser miserable y estar solo, no tener nadie con quien compartir sus miedos. Este contraste se conjuga en una novela triste pero decidida a mostrar la cara oscura de la enfermedad (no tiene otra, la verdad) y de la muerte, adem\u00e1s de una sociedad caraque\u00f1a donde el presente es lo que vale. Tiene un tono tambi\u00e9n de cr\u00edtica social, pero no es tan marcado.Me gusta la prosa de Barrera Tyszka, va acompasada con la historia.

What is it about? What point does it make? How did I experience it?Each time I do so, I answer those questions differently, which is, in and of itself, very fascinating to me.So, starting with the obvious, it is a novel about sickness, real and fatal or perceived and just as crippling.It is also a novel about obsession, that of others for us, and that of ourselves turned inwardly.It is about grief, always real, about closure, needed and dreaded, about loneliness, inevitable.But it is also a story about compassion and love as one experiences them when nothing else is left.Throughout the book, each character experiences a disintegration of what they held dear, of what made their life and a fraying of the cloak of dignity that they had come to mistake for their identity. When all of that crumbles, all that is left is their resplendent humanity. And for all of us who have lost a parent or escorted a loved one through the end of life, this is not a novel... it is a vessel that contains each and everyone of us alone, and all of us at once."}, {"userName": "Ugh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh", "userReview": "I didn't like the omniscient narration.

This was to be mixed with the personal turmoil of said doctor who has discovered that his father has inoperable cancer and can't bring himself to tell him.... This is did not happen! Instead of the above I was introduced to Dr. Andreas Miranda and his father Javier. Now I wasn't wrong about personal turmoil, Miranda senior has lung cancer and Andreas debates whether or not he should or even can tell him. This takes up a good half of the book (granted it's only 151 pages long). The other half is filled with both Javier and Andreas coming to terms with the cancer and inevitably death. I'm sad to say I didn't feel for Andreas, of course we all react in different ways to difference crisis' but he has been portrayed in such a way that he almost come across as selfish and this is even after he has broken to the news to his father. However, the stalking hypochondriac is a minor feature of the book and really holds no impact into what the author has made the main focus of the book. He has hardly any contact with Dr. Miranda and no impact on his what-so-ever. The sell of Ernesto Duran, the hypochondriac, is also very questionable. Make of it as you will but following the doctor a grand total of one time, in which he tried to talk to him about his \"condition\" and sending a few e-mails is hardly obsessive. I feel let down, not because of how the story between father and son was played out but because my hope of a thrilling, stalker based novel was nearly non-existent.However I do have praises, I loved how Alberto Barrera Tyszka adds in quotes from authors throughout showing a true literary passion. The research he has taken while writing this book is clear from the get-go. Theodore Dalrymple of the British Medical Journal said while reviewing the book \"I assumed this book was written by a doctor\" and I believe this statement to be true. The medial knowledge Tyszka has shown is outstanding and adds something to the book.Although it wasn't what I was expecting before or even after the book holds merit and is powerful in some ways but could of been so much more I feel."}, {"userName": "J.T.

The man has already been given a clean bill of health but persists in his belief that he is ill; and Karina Sanchez (Dr. Miranda's secretary), who feels compassion for the patient that Miranda so casually dismisses and then ignores.Employing poetic finesse and multiple points of views, Tyszka delves deeply into each of these characters to examine how the idea and the reality of illness affects them. The Sickness raises issues such as cancer treatments, euthanasia, mental and physical illnesses, the good life, and makes us reflect on our own expectations toward these subjects. Tyszka's thoughtful, precise prose creates a disturbing novel that resonates long after the last page has been read."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1058295-anne", "userReview": "I read this because it is set in Venezuela and was translated from the original language. It has also won several prizes. However I was quite disappointed overall. I never got attached to the characters and while the premise in intriguing, I was not thrilled with the execution of it.This is the story of Dr. Andres Miranda. When his dad is not feeling well, he goes in for tests which all come back indicating that his dad is fine. However, instinct or something makes Dr. Miranda request different tests. These tests reveal that his dad has aggressive cancer that has already progressed quite far and he does not have much time left. He struggles with the decision of whether to tell his dad or not.Then there is another story line about Dr. Miranda neglecting enquiries from one of his patients and actually refuses to see, talk to, or email this patient. This plot-line seems to detract from the other as the stories never really intersect.Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I was fluent enough to have read it in the original language (Spanish)."}, {"userName": "Ineke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8916278-ineke", "userReview": "De verloren pati\u00ebnten van dokter Adr\u00e9s Miranda is een bijzonder mooi boek. Waarin de ervaren arts Andr\u00e9s Miranda voor de keuze komt te staan om zijn vader te vertellen dat hij ongeneeslijk ziek is. Terwijl hij eerlijkheid en openheid tegenover zijn pati\u00ebnten altijd hoog in het vaandel heeft staan. Dat is voor hem een heel belangrijk onderdeel van zijn beroep. Maar nu het om zijn eigen vader gaat heeft hij twijfels. Andr\u00e9s besluit met zijn vader Javier op vakantie te gaan en zo een moment te vinden om het te vertellen. Dat moment komt pas op het allerlaatst als ze alweer bijna thuis zijn. De waarheid komt hard aan en de beide mannen voelen zich ongemakkelijk in elkaars nabijheid. De schrijver weet de worsteling van Andr\u00e9s en Javier heel mooi te beschrijven. Sommige stukken zijn bijna po\u00ebtisch.

This slim novel covers a lot of ground in a quiet way, introducing philosophical questions about illness and dying, pain and lying.

The prose is weighty (in a good way) and thoughtful, powerful and sinister.

Two stories run parallel; the diagnosis of a doctor\u2019s father with cancer, and a neurotic patient writing to the same doctor about his apparently phantom illness.
