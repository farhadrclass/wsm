See my review of volume one...In the sequel series to Tokyo Ghoul, Haise Sasaki has been tasked with teaching his special squad of half-ghouls how to be outstanding Investigators, but this is complicated by the troublesome personalities of his subordinates and his own uncertain grasp of his Ghoul powers. Will he and the members of his squad become heroes or monsters, taken out by the other squads in the Commission of Counter Ghoul...?!I've got to start with the art because yeah, I picked it up because of the gorgeous watercolor art and the strikingly realistic black and white drawings. It's just as gorgeous this volume as the previous one. There was some great techniques to show the auras of a couple of the characters as well as some incredible frames that start the battles at the end. The character designs are such that even if I don't know some of the secondary characters' names I can still keep them separate visually, quite an accomplishment if you are going to have so many characters!The plot of this volume is to setup the investigation needed for the huge battles in volume 3! I'm so glad I was able to review volumes 2 and 3 together because storywise they are heavily linked (I suggest picking them up together!) As such they act as a great contrast to each other. We meet a fourth Quinx who hadn't appeared in volume 1 and a crazy great special investigator Juzo, who is friends with Haise! And a bunch of antagonists are inserted in compelling ways... I wasn't always able to follow what was going on but I was engaged in each of the side characters.You just can't help but love how rich with character and plot this story is... A LOT is crammed into each volume... its well worth the price from that standpoint alone! But the tension is ratcheted up in this volume and I was particularly worried for Toru... But because there are sooooo many character (something I LOVE) the tension doesn't stay high. You are too busy switching from person to person and trying to figure out what those frames mean. I don't mind this but I'm also not flying through the volume... its more a series you want to buy and savor.I've really been sucked into the world and the different motivations of all the characters. They range from pure hearted Haise, to selfish Urie, to the ghouls who sometimes don't feel as evil as they should... While I am confused at times I wouldn't want the story to be simpler or less involved. That's part of the story's charm and why you feel compelled to keep reading.\u22c6\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Authenticity\u22c6\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Tension\u22c6\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Plot\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 ArtBOTTOM LINE: BATTLES, here I come!!!Thanks to Diamond Bookshelf and the publisher for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review.

It ends with a ghoul auction in which one of that team finds himself in great peril and we meet one of Tsukiyama\u2019s entourage who is determined that his Gourmet shall carry on, even if he no longer has the will to. We meet a score a new characters with sinister motivations, plus some old ones who\u2019ve reinvented themselves, or are struggling to carry on in various dramatic way. The artwork in this is gorgeous. I was stunned by how beautiful both Sasaki and Touka were. I\u2019m not sure what I think of Mutsuki and Urie yet. Shurazu is developing nicely as is Suzuya. I marvel at how much the latter has calmed down and matured in this new series. Kinue and Chie Horie are fascinating new additions to the cast. Ayato, Hinami, Orochi, and Donato intrigued me a great deal in the mysteries they presented and the changes they\u2019d gone through. Additional matters of interest was Sasaki\u2019s team cross-dressing and the various reactions to it. I was a little sorry Sasaki didn\u2019t keep up his feminine guise. I would have loved to see Tsukiyama\u2019s reaction to it, especially if our Gourmet had shown up and danced with our former prey at the club, ahem. I get the feeling we\u2019re building up to a dramatic revelation regarding Tsukiyama, considering the new characters we\u2019re meeting who are close to him and their concern regarding his welfare. I\u2019m hoping Sanae Yonebayashi will get a little more development as well. I\u2019m getting this feeling of untapped potential behind her lazy exterior, which reminds me of Shikamaru in the \u2018Naruto\u2019 manga. We\u2019ll see if I\u2019m right about this. The whole battle at the Auction was almost a return to the Gourmet plotline, only with higher stakes. A pity Tsukiyama and Urie didn\u2019t make it to the action, but I\u2019m hoping for something special we\u2019re building up to with them.
