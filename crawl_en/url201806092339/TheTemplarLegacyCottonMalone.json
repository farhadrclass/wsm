The full, original name was \"The Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple which is in Jerusalem\", but the for the sake of this review I will just refer to them as The Templars. \nBy papal decree only The Templars were allowed to wear the cross patee. The red cross is probably the most famous identifying symbol for the order. The Templars because of their austere living conditions and their shrewd lending policies became very wealthy and powerful. Philip the IV of France, a man with ambitions that exceeded his pocketbook borrowed large sums of money from The Templars. When the interest payments became inconvenient Phillip the IV began putting pressure on Pope Boniface VIII to disband the order. \nWELCHER!!!To facilitate this end Phillip went so far as to attempt to kidnap the Pope. The Pope survived long enough to excommunicate the king, but then died from wounds received in the attempt. The new Pope decided it was in his best interest to lift the excommunication order, but it was his successor Clement the V who gave Phillip what he wanted. \nOn Friday the 13th 1307 The Templars are rounded up. They are charged with satanism and unnatural practices. Inquisition tactics are used to illicit confessions. It always amazes me the creativity the human species can bring to bear in finding new and malicious ways to torture another human being. Wouldn't you think you'd find a tried and true method and stick with it? The sick perversion of the amount of time spent thinking about and testing new ways to elicit pain from a helpless individual is beyond my comprehension. Jacques De Molay is the head of the order, the grand master, when the purges begin. He receives special attention from the inquisition, but once they acquire his confession they continue to inflict pain on him. \nHe at one point is nailed to a door and then the door is swung back and forth to put the utmost pressure on the bones grating against the nails in his flesh. In 1314 they burn him at the stake and finally his ordeal is over. Templars did survive the purges and they reformed, but kept themselves hidden and out of the public eye. Legend has it that De Molay hid a great treasure before his incarceration and with it an item only referred to as The Great Device.Steve Berry weaves his story around the rise to prominence of a Grand Master Templar who wishes to restore the order to their place of respect and honor. The hero of the story is Cotton Malone, a retired CIA operative who decided to move to Copenhagen to open a bookstore. His old boss comes to visit him in Copenhagen and before they can even meet Malone finds himself in a desperate chase across Copenhagen. As Malone moves around Europe interpreting clues and in the process thwarting the aims of the Grand Master Templar, the plot unfolds in spectacular fashion. There is blackmail, murder, betrayal, mayhem, secret doors, inventive escapes, and not a single sexual situation or even a hint of romantic entanglement. Steve Berry kept all his characters too busy to even pause for a moment of sexual gratification. This is a plot driven novel, characterization is actually very weak, and is the main reason why I bumped this down to three stars. I really wanted to know more about Cotton Malone's life in Copenhagen, but before we are able to see \"a day in the life of a Copenhagen bookseller\" we are blasted into this complicated, elaborate plot that keeps the pages turning. Malone is like MacGyver, Van Damme, and James Bond all rolled into one SUPER AGENT. A misstep is only an opportunity for him to concoct a dazzling display of unequivocally awesomeness. He does receive some good advice from his boss. \"Say it, do it, preach it, shout it, but never, absolutely never, believe your own bullshit. I've got a few people I know that I might forward that bit of wisdom to.I can only hope that with further entries in the series Steve Berry will actually convince me that Cotton Malone has any real interest in the book trade. Further development of Malone and adding more time spent in the book world could place this series at the top of my guilty pleasures list. I thought the plot may have tilted too heavy a nod to Dan Brown, but the primary purpose of a thriller is to be a page turner; a book that takes the reader away from their own mundane existence, and this book fulfills that stipulation admirably."}, {"userName": "Todd", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/780655-todd", "userReview": "Steve Berry is the thinking man's Dan Brown. I was immediately impressed after reading The Romanov Prophecy, and The Third Secret. The Templar Legacy does not disappoint. If you enjoyed The DaVinci Code you will appreciate this novel all the more.Berry mixes a decent understanding of folkore and history in this fast paced quest for the real Templar Treasure.\" He even takes a decent pot shot at all the conspiratroialists and others who have made fortunes off a well-documented hoax. The book's idea of \"The Great Device,\" and what it was is based on speculation that has goes back at least 2 or more centuries, and it has nothing to do with Mary Magdelene or the supposed Holy Grail, which was nothing more that Christianized versions of pre-Christian European Myths - the nonsense about san graal meaning royal bloodline not withstanding.Great Fiction writing!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "Maybe not quite a 4 star read, it dragged a bit in places & was quite long, but Berry certainly did his historical homework & came up with a great conspiracy. If you're not familiar with some of it, as I wasn't (I looked up more online.) he had a great author's note at the end that covered the main points.While about religious people, orders, & conspiracies, Berry took a great secular look at it all, but wasn't insensitive to religious folks. He didn't berate the Gospels for their inconsistencies, but did cover many of the points & give a very realistic look at why they are, yet still made a case for religion. Pretty cool & I'm a pretty anti-religious person.It was certainly a twisty mystery, somewhat overdone. Most of the characters were very well done. I didn't care for Cassiopeia, though. She overdone & wasn't believable at all. Felt tacked on in a lot of ways.Overall, quite good.

This is about an American, Cotton Malone (which I\u2019m not too thrilled with that name, lol!), who is now a bookseller in Denmark after retiring as a US Operative. He\u2019s trying to live the quiet life when he finds himself embroiled in a quest (with his former boss) that involves the Knights Templar and looking for \u201cThe Great Devise\u201d. Yes this type of storyline and pace is reminiscent of The DaVinci Code but again, I really like these kinds of books. One part of the story is disputing the belief that Jesus Christ rose from the dead and the thought-provoking line: \u201cIt has served us well, this myth of Christ\u201d \u2013 Pope Leo X. I, myself, was brought up Catholic so the thing about these types of stories is that you have to go into it with an open mind. Obviously the author does his research and a lot of the book is based on historical references. But you also have to realize that a lot is fiction\u2026\u2026.embellished. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that since the book is\u2026\u2026...fiction. I\u2019ve seen way too many reviews on stories like these where people complain that it\u2019s wrong, there\u2019s no basis for it, no proof. Whatever. It\u2019s fun. It takes you all over the world.

Fascinating, isn't it? My initial reaction upon seeing it for the second time, having just brought home The Templar Legacy, was, oh no, it's the SAME BOOK! Really, though, aside from both dealing with lost Templar treasure and the possible non-divinity of Christ, they're quiet different novels. (I may have even enjoyed this one more than either The Last Templar or The Da Vinci Code.) Berry tells the story cleanly with few unnecessary distractions, and the pacing is excellent. The twists and turns of plot were only predictable in that they were legion; Berry kept me guessing almost all of the time, and I was always intrigued. All in all, a good read.What's really interesting for me, though, in all of these novels, is how much I find myself reflecting of my own religious beliefs. I think I enjoy them even more because they do challenge established Christianity, and, consequently, my beliefs. They make me think about things I often take for granted. I think that's partly why I'm drawn to them, and have read them all, despite their undeniable similarities. There is a fourth, a just-released novel called Labyrinth that I think I'll be checking out within the next few weeks. Apparently I can't get enough!

The author, Steve Berry, has been described as \"the thinking man's Dan Brown\" and I can see why. I am certainly no biblical scholar but the book seemed to be well researched and real world mysteries are dealt with in a plausible way. I do wish, though, that readers who are offended by anything that challenges their religious views would just avoid those novels in the first place rather than read them and then trash the book's viewpoint.I enjoyed learning much more about the Templars and how they evolved through history. I also liked the settings in Copenhagen and France, and having been to most of the locales described in the novel, found myself transported back to those places.The plot was intriguing and while I thought the overall mystery to be sufficiently compelling and well paced, I felt the dialogue was a bit stilted. I've noticed this with other Steve Berry novels as well. The one thing that I appreciated the most was that Cotton Malone, our protagonist, served as a great foil for the reader. Just when I felt like saying, \"That doesn't make sense,\" Cotton says, \"That doesn't make sense.\" Since the mystery elements of the plot are quite complicated, it really helped when he asked the same questions I wanted to ask at exactly the right points. It was almost uncanny.So, yes, I will definitely be reading more of the Cotton Malone series."}, {"userName": "Piyangie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48056505-piyangie", "userReview": "This is the first book of the Cotton Malone series, and thus far, the best one I have read. I'm sure my fascination with the history of Knights Templar was a weighing factor in my rating of the book. Nevertheless, Steve Berry has done a good job in mixing history with an interesting story line. The story was quick paced with full of action. The employment of diverse characters made it all the more interesting. I liked most of them, especially the Seneschal, Mark Nelly. But Cotton Malone was another story. His lack of authority and inaction made me irritable at times. I wonder what Mr. Berry was thinking in using such a lousy character as his lead.

They were a Catholic military order founded around 1119 until around 1312. \"The Templars were closely tied to the Crusades; when the Holy Land was lost, support for the order faded. Rumours about the Templars' secret initiation ceremony created distrust, and King Philip IV of France\u2014deeply in debt to the order\u2014took advantage of the situation to gain control over them. In 1307, he had many of the order's members in France arrested, tortured into giving false confessions, and burned at the stake. Pope Clement V disbanded the order in 1312 under pressure from King Philip.\" [source]During the time period they were active, they were the wealthiest and most powerful group, which grew rapidly. Their abrupt disbanding led to speculation and legend, which is where this book comes in. It plays on the legacy and legend of the Templars, and this now shadowy group of Knights are hunting for the secrets that have been passed down from master to master. Cotton Malone, the protagonist of the story, is a retired top operative of the U.S. Justice Department who is drawn back into the cloak-and-dagger world when his former boss, Stephanie Nelle, is violently robbed.I thought the story was very well written (although it did drag at times) and was excellently researched. I felt like I was learning a lot about history, but at the same time, taken on this thrilling, shadowy, conspiracy-filled world. The story switches views several times, between Cotton, Raymond de Roquefort (the villain of the story), as well as few other characters, but the story never lost track with the different POVs.

Of course then his characters are all like \"Well this info doesn't really matter in today's modern society...\" after they spent all this effort finding it. The characters are all underdeveloped and constantly tripping over each other- did Berry seriously need the whole troop present for the final confrontation? Some of the characters seemed like they were created just because the author thought there weren't enough, or that his already existing characters were too boring, or something. I'm still trying to figure out why Cotton Malone was the main character. Oh right, so Berry could create a travel/adventure/thriller series based on him. Otherwise there was no reason for Malone to be moving the plot forward. Cassiopeia was interesting but gone before she actually ever became relevant. She was just there to provide another plot twist (Thorvaldson sure gets around!) and to save Malone's ass from situations Berry couldn't write him out of.Anyway, this book was lame.

If you are looking for an escapist page-turner, then this book may be of interest. But please don't take any notice of his theological discussions. His dating of the Gospels is questionable, and he makes no mention of Paul's writings. 1 Corinthians is an undisputed Pauline letter, and Paul's chapter on the resurrection (chapter 15) blows Berry's liberal scholarship out of the water: it's early and refers to all of Jesus' resurrection appearances that were later written about in the Gospels.

Un'esistenza tranquilla, che per\u00f2 viene sconvolta quando il suo ex superiore, Stephanie Nelle, giunta in Danimarca per una breve vacanza, cade vittima di uno scippo e il ladro, poco dopo, muore in circostanze misteriose. Malone allora segue Stephanie a un'asta di libri antichi e l\u00ec scopre la ragione del viaggio della donna: acquistare un volume, apparentemente senza valore, che tuttavia viene aggiudicato a qualcun altro, disposto a pagare una cifra esorbitante per impadronirsene. A questo punto, Stephanie \u00e8 costretta a rivelare a Malone la verit\u00e0: sta ricostruendo una catena di indizi rinvenuti dal marito, uno studioso di esoterismo morto alcuni anni prima, e quel libro \u00e8 la tessera fondamentale di un puzzle che potrebbe risolvere il mistero del paesino francese di Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau e, di conseguenza, del mitico tesoro scomparso dei Cavalieri Templari. Ma \u00e8 ormai ovvio che Stephanie non \u00e8 l'unica a voler far luce sull'enigma che circonda il luogo in cui sarebbero custoditi numerosi testi segreti, proibiti dalla Chiesa, e immense ricchezze. Lo dimostrano la spirale d'intrighi e di morte che si dipana all'istante intorno a lei e a Malone, e che sembra aver origine proprio da un'antica cospirazione legata ai Templari.Siamo al solito filone post-Il Codice da Vinci, dunque un thriller storico-religioso che pone in chiava romanzata un pezzo di storia che \u00e8 apparentemente avvolta da qualche mistero. Non nego che in alcune parti sia entusiasmante e coinvolgente, con un testo che \u00e8 scritto in maniera scorrevole e che si legge abbastanza velocemente anche quando l'autore elargisce spiegazioni storiche. I personaggi sono abbastanza interessanti e ben caratterizzati, si muovono in un ritmo incalzante e attraverso un mistero affascinante da risolvere.Il problema essenziale \u00e8 che letto uno di questi libri che si rifanno al filone thriller storico-religioso, hai la sensazione di averli letti tutti. Anche se gli argomenti, i personaggi e i misteri da risolvere cambiano, per tutto il libro continui ad avere un, in questo caso, pesante senso di deja-vu."}, {"userName": "Billy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10554432-billy", "userReview": "I found this book after reading The Da Vinci Code. I was enthralled from cover to cover and have found through this book, The Da Vinci Code and 1 other book that I am now a closet Templar conspiracy theorist.Well written with good plot twists and suspense. Steve Berry is a gifted author with a special talent for suspense and history.Historical fiction lovers will get plenty from this book. Suspense lovers will not be disappointed. There is even some blood for the horror fans. I guess the only people who wouldn't enjoy this are those that like romance novels.This particular novel centers on the search for the Holy Grail and present day Knights Templar that exist in total secrecy. Cotton Malone, the main character, is pulled in to a plot of international intrigue when his former boss (from a secret government agency he retired from) turns up in his hometown and and has her purse stolen. When the man is pursued he commits suicide after uttering a latin phrase that is connected with the Knights Templar. Cotton must use his skills as a former government agent and his knowledge as a bibliophile to solve a riddle that is hundreds of years old. All the while, he is pursued by a sadistic man bent on eliminating him because he knows about the Templars.Regardless of your tastes, Berry has written 4 novels on 4 different topics and all 4 are fantastic. Just look at the reviews for his other books and you can trust that you are buying a great book when you get this one."}, {"userName": "Siobhan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/462617-siobhan", "userReview": "[>About halfway through we find that Jesus never rose from the dead. I liked the ulitmate conclusion of the novel; how it handles the issue of faith, and what faith is for. But I was pretty annoyed that the gospel of Matthew, which the author specifically references, also explicitly states that guards were set at the tomb and therefore obliterates the novel's entire premise that followers stole and hid Jesus' remains. If you're going to be postulating exotic and revolutionary what-ifs in a quasi-realistic way, don't be sloppy. However, author gets points for including an afterword that clearly states what is history and what is fiction.

You know what am talking about.Then there is a woman, partner to the man, divorced too.What are they looking for, the book.Then we have the bad guys, they are killing people for the book.The story is not as simple as I have put it though. The book is actually interesting. A lot of history to learn and other valuable facts. Kudos to Steve Berry. I never thought I could read this kind of book.The action unfolds in Denmark, when Malone and Stephanie meet and attend an auction together with the aim of bidding for a book that has secrets of ancient monks. They don't acquire the book, sbdy else does and they have to find the book.The action spills to France after they obtain the book.

Filled with facts and mysteries involving \"The Great Devise,\" the long lost Templar treasure who some hypothesize as being proof of Jesus' mortality, the book takes the reader through twists and turns, all the while being action packed. The book does have multiple characters, both as part of the story and the story's history, so sometimes is may get confusing. Don't dismay though, it is well worth the attention, and is an excellent read compared to others. Will Cotton Malone and Stephanie Nelle find the Great Devise before evil others do? Is the treasure made of gold, or secret knowledge?

Instead of the Illuminati, this book has the Knights Templar. Instead of the search for the Holy Grail (Mary Magdelene), this book searches for the truth of the resurrection, whether it was fact or myth.The history lesson of the Knights Templar was worth the read."}], "description": "The ancient order of the Knights Templar possessed untold wealth and absolute power over kings and popes . . . until the Inquisition, when they were wiped from the face of the earth, their hidden riches lost. But now two forces vying for the treasure have learned that it is not at all what they thought it was\u2013and its true nature could change the modern world.Cotton Malone, one-time top operative for the U.S. Justice Department, is enjoying his quiet new life as an antiquarian book dealer in Copenhagen when an unexpected call to action reawakens his hair-trigger instincts\u2013and plunges him back into the cloak-and-dagger world he thought he\u2019d left behind.It begins with a violent robbery attempt on Cotton\u2019s former supervisor, Stephanie Nelle, who\u2019s far from home on a mission that has nothing to do with national security. Armed with vital clues to a series of centuries-old puzzles scattered across Europe, she means to crack a mystery that has tantalized scholars and fortune-hunters through the ages by finding the legendary cache of wealth and forbidden knowledge thought to have been lost forever when the order of the Knights Templar was exterminated in the fourteenth century. But she\u2019s not alone. Competing for the historic prize\u2013and desperate for the crucial information Stephanie possesses\u2013is Raymond de Roquefort, a shadowy zealot with an army of assassins at his command.Welcome or not, Cotton seeks to even the odds in the perilous race. But the more he learns about the ancient conspiracy surrounding the Knights Templar, the more he realizes that even more than lives are at stake. At the end of a lethal game of conquest, rife with intrigue, treachery, and craven lust for power, lies a shattering discovery that could rock the civilized world\u2013and, in the wrong hands, bring it to its knees.", "title": "The Templar Legacy\n      \n          (Cotton Malone #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75024.The_Templar_Legacy", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413393638l/75024.jpg", "reviews": 1887, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3621.Steve_Berry", "name": "Steve Berry"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Thriller", "Mystery", "Historical", "Adventure"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75024.The_Templar_Legacy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10075400-the-templar-legacy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1422161.The_Templar_Legacy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1467428.The_Templar_Legacy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6057008-the-templar-legacy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9770439-l-ultima-cospirazione", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74824.The_Alexandria_Link", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1178039.The_Venetian_Betrayal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75020.The_Romanov_Prophecy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5369.The_Amber_Room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7840156-the-emperor-s-tomb", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
