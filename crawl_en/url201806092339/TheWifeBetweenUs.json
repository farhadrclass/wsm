Ugh, I'm almost as disappointed in myself as I am in this book. I don't consider myself an especially astute mystery/thriller reader. Pull out a good twist and I will probably be surprised. But here I saw the first big twist coming, and the string of twists after that left me feeling cold. Trust me to be wearing my detective glasses at the exact moment I really needed to be surprised.The Wife Between Us basically introduces itself in the blurb as a book full of twists. Assume nothing, it warns. A big chunk of the plot is fairly quiet and uneventful, which means a lot hangs on that moment of thrilling shock one should experience as the authors pull out their surprises. It's not a book that survives very well on its own if you happen to figure out the truth.And I did. Or, at least, I got the first truth. The authors have this big dramatic moment where they metaphorically lift the curtain... and I was so disappointed to have worked out what was happening. The impact just wasn't there. The slow climb to what should have been a shocking climax was just a slow climb for me.I'll give away as little as possible. The book begins by alternating between the perspectives of Richard's ex-wife, Vanessa, who has been left penniless and with a drinking problem ever since their mysterious break-up, and his new and young fianc\u00e9e, Nellie, who is busy making wedding plans and trying to ignore the feeling that someone is following her. Vanessa is determined to stop Richard marrying again, but how far will she go to prevent it? That's pretty much all I can safely tell you. If I'm honest, after the first twist didn't quite hit the spot, I think my attitude toward the book changed. Where before I'd been eagerly anticipating the reveals, I was now waiting, somewhat unmoved, for the twists to happen. And, of course, more and more did. It gets a little excessive after a while. BAM, twist! BAM, another twist! At one point, I stopped being shocked by the revelations because I figured something else would soon be along to tear that apart, too.And that very last twist? I rolled my eyes. It felt so unnecessary and kind of silly. It was already tough keeping track of what the real story was; we didn't need another shocker tagged on. Plus, the whole subplot with Maggie and Jason was boring and took up too much page time.Some books are full of enough tension and/or interesting characterization to make it okay if you guess what is going on, and some books pull out twists that are shocking and impressive enough that the surprise carries the story. I know for a lot of people The Wife Between Us will be, and is, the latter, but it didn't quite work for me.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "j e w e l s [Books Bejeweled]", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68216634-j-e-w-e-l-s-books-bejeweled", "userReview": "OH.

What is Nellie hiding?Nellie doesn\u2019t know very much about Richard\u2019s ex. Just that they split up before he met Nellie. Richard really is the best thing that ever happened to Nellie.\n\u201cShe\u2019d always regret certain decisions in her life, but choosing Richard would never be one of them\u201d\nVANESSA is living at her aunt\u2019s house.

This was a fun and entertaining read, but in the end it wasn\u2019t the right book for me. I loved the first half of this book--I ate up every word, and dreaded the moment when I had to put it down. I was surprised by the first twist--it threw me for a loop! Seriously, I was so addicted to this book that I read it every chance I got, including walking to my car at night (dumb move on my end). But then as more and more twists occurred and Vanessa\u2019s story further unraveled, I just wasn\u2019t feeling it anymore. I grew bored as I waiting for something to happen. After her final confrontation with Richard, the remaining chapters felt superfluous. And that final twist?! UGH. NOPE. Did not work for me.  I finished the final page, rolled my eyes and groaned out of frustration. What had started out with so much promise turned into a bit of a ridiculous mess that seemed more concerned with twists than substance.This book is receiving tons of great reviews, and many of my Goodreads friends absolutely love it. I am often overly critical when it comes to thrillers, so I would recommend that you read  The Wife Between Us and judge for yourself!I would have given this one star, but bumped up my rating as I was completely captivated and entertained by the first half.I received a copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "This is without doubt a tense psychological thriller that makes a impact. It has you wondering if what you were reading was for real, and re-reading to check. It has you questioning what you think you know and where nothing is as it seems. Vanessa Thompson is a divorced woman who is barely managing to keep herself together and her days off from her job at Saks endanger her employment. She exists in a alcoholic haze, the wine bottles in her home attest to this. Vanessa used to be married to the wealthy Richard, a good looking hedge fund manager. The end of her marriage has left her floundering as she wonders about the effects of fertility medication, her failure to be the ideal wife, and haunted by events that happened to her when she was at college.What pierces Vanessa's alcoholic haze is the shocking news that Richard is planning to remarry. Something she has no intention of letting happen as she embarks on a crusade. She must protect the intended wife, she must not undergo what Vanesssa suffered. However, is Vanessa to be relied upon? And why should another woman believe her? The narrative is delivered from the perspective of the main characters. This is a story with huge twists and a compelling storyline. It dissects the anatomy and complexities of a marriage, the lies, the secrets, the manipulation and the betrayals. Whilst you may have to occasionally suspend your disbelief, this is nevertheless a book that will grab your attention and never let go.

My favorite thriller of 2017WOWOWOWOWOWI am leaving my first impression above because it still fits how I am feeling several hours after finishing this book. I think some may find the first third of this book slower-building (which I happen to love) and possibly even a tiny bit confusing. I will not give anything away, but keep going. Trust me. I already have a book hangover from this because my next book is not written nearly as well. So about that, the writing is flawless. It flows just how I like. Not an extra word. No fluff, no frills. This was written by two authors, and I have no idea how they did it because it's seamless. The characters- Vanessa, Nellie, Richard, Aunt Charlotte, even Duke- so much to love, hate, and ponder. This had a completely original premise. And the best part- I was duped! The synopsis says it best:Assume nothing. I was floored! My head was spinning. This is a book you will want to discuss with all your book friends once you finish, so please read it and discuss with me! I hope beyond hope that these two authors write together again.

Each time I started a sentence, I was giving away too much of the plot. I went into this book blindly. I saw that the ratings were awesome and noticed it was a thriller which is my favorite genre, its not only just a thriller but a psychological thriller. I did read the blurb and the blurb didn't give anything away either. I had no idea what this book was about, and this book has lots of twists and turns that are full of surprises. The twists and turns make this book so much fun.I suggest you go into this book blindly and hope you get the same surprises as I did. I am using the blurb as my review because I think its perfect for this book, and then I will put down my thoughts. A novel of suspense that explores the complexities of marriage and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.You will assume you are reading about a jealous wife and her obsession with her replacement.You will assume you are reading about a woman about to enter a new marriage with the man she loves.You will assume the first wife was a disaster and that the husband was well rid of her.You will assume you know the motives, the history, the anatomy of the relationships.Assume nothing.Discover the next blockbuster novel of suspense, and get ready for the read of your life.I can not say that I was hooked straight from the very beginning. This one has a slow burn going into it. Once I got into it though I couldn't put it down. It was like a rollercoaster ride filled with twists and turns. I found this psychological thriller to be very addicting once I got to the suspense. The chapters are very short, so it is a fast paced read. This book is very well written. I loved the dialogue, and the writing style. The characters were so well developed. This one kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me guessing. All the clues were there but it was like a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces of this puzzle just made this an unpredictable read for me. It was so surprising. I could not put it down and kept wondering what was going to happen next. The book ended very well. It kept my attention and amazed me. It has several jaw dropping moments. I recommend it.

It\u2019s really GOOD! ZERO SPOILERS!!!!!I personally think it must have been a \u2018KICK-OF-FUN\u2019 for authors Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen to collaborate together. There is a wonderful YouTube of both authors speaking about \u2018how\u2019 they went about writing it together - they didn\u2019t each just take one character. They both worked on everything ..... and it sure sounds like they treasured working together. Its very cool to see two women working together like they did: touches something extra special in me. Congrats to them both..... GREAT RESULTS TOO! I\u2019m not going to going to explain this novel away... but you will meet Nellie, Vanessa, Richard, Samantha, Maureen, Charlotte, Mrs Keene, Frank, Lucille, Emma, and a few other characters. Think of \u2018all\u2019 the characters in the story - including names I haven\u2019t mentioned as your puzzle pieces. As in doing a jigsaw puzzle, it\u2019s not complete until every piece has been put together. The enjoyment of reading psychological suspense novels, often has more to do with the \u2018game\u2019 of piecing the \u2018story-puzzle\u2019 together than the specifics of the story itself. As for the storytelling itself - the writing is excellent- the dialogue superb ....with plots and subplots. Some details were more interesting to me than others. For example - I liked there\u2019re being a pre school - \u201cThe Learning Ladder\u201d \u2014but rolled my eyes at the cost of $32,000 a year. I wasn\u2019t too crazy about a parent putting her three-year-old in mandarin classes, karate, and music classes all at the same time..... as it feed into my thoughts of \u201cthe hurried child\u201d.I\u2019m not thrilled with stereotyping the wealthy parents/ low paying teacher themes in our fiction books too much.... even though I\u2019m aware it\u2019s true. I\u2019m a little tired of it \u2014  yet .... I loved the way the characters were developed. The biggest enjoyment was trying to fit clues together and do double takes when surprising chunks fell from the sky. I don\u2019t want my entire reading-diet to be this genre....but when I do pick one \u2014 I want the spicy elements of the guessing game to pull the rug out from under me .... \u201cThe Wife Between Us\u201d YANKED the rug ( out from under me). 4.5 Thank You St. Martin\u2019s Press, Netgalley, Greer Hendricks, and Sarah Pekkhanen"}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "NOW AVAILABLE!!!every time i read a review where a book is \u201cpraised\u201d as being \"compulsively readable,\" i roll my eyes. ev. er. y. time.and i don't know if this particular book has received that lazy praise-umbrella anywhere, but in general, it's one of those overused empty-calorie assessments that tells me nothing about a book but is taking up space and time where i could have been reading something more useful. which is how most karen-eyerolls are earned. and yet... i gulped this book down, i got mad when i had to pause in my reading of it to sleep, get off the train, go to work, look both ways for traffic (i read while i walk down streets), etc, and while i'm not here claiming it's the literary masterpiece that's going to change books forever, it is - dare i say??COMPULSIVELEY READABLE!full review to come.(from me - there are plenty of other reviews on here that are bound to be better than mine, have at 'em!) okay, \u201cto come\u201d is now. so - this book was an unsolicited bonus book that st. martin\u2019s sent along way back when they sent me an arc of Emma in the Night for review. this arc had a plain white cover, the pub date was 7 months away, and it was written by two authors*, none of which were pushing this book to the top of my stack: i\u2019m easily swayed by cover art, i\u2019m always wary of books written by more than one person, and i had a mountain of arcs with closer pub dates that needed my attention. so i put this one off for a while, figuring it was just one more hastily-written book being plopped onto the neverending conveyor belt of middlebrow marriage-based psych suspense. but nooooooo - this is probably** the best psychological suspense i read all year (and i read a few), and i liked this one more than Emma in the Night, so thank you for the unexpected treat, st. martins! i was just being silly up there, but there really is something compulsively readable about this book. it\u2019s a breezy, easy read, but i don\u2019t mean that in a bad way. i\u2019m not sure how to articulate it - it\u2019s unchallenging without being unambitious, if that makes sense. because this had to have taken pretty rigorous plotting and outlining for all the twists and reveals to land***, so it\u2019s damn ambitious, but it goes down like pudding. and along the way, there are a couple of lumps in the pudding - not enough to ruin the taste, but enough to make you pause and say \u201chmmmm,\u201d and try to figure out what those lumps signify, and i, for one, did not figure it out until the authors wanted me to figure it out. which is exactly what i want out of a book in this genre. so - many kudos and much gratitude to those involved in writing and editing this book. it was so much fun (where the definition of \"fun\" is modulated to take into account the genre standards of people being horrible to each other), and very surprising. so no spoilers, suckers! get your own pudding! * and i\u2019m not a book snob - no one who has read as much monsterporn as i have is gonna have any judgment left in them, but i do know my own preferences, and one of the authors has published a number of books whose cover montage of \u201cback of a woman gazing out in contemplation at the sea/the woods/some other vista\u201d made me think they would not be aligned with my particular tastes. i prefer action to introspection in my books. ** it\u2019s either this or Sometimes I Lie*** and it\u2019s very rare for them all to land in such an early arc, so give the editorial team a pizza party"}, {"userName": "Holly  B", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39749481-holly-b", "userReview": "I am just speechless!

Engrossing domestic thriller! This book got such a tremendous response from my fellow GR friends, I shot it up to the top of my TBR list, ignoring my usual cautionary optimistic approach to well received popular books, because I just had a feeling this one would deliver. Richard\u2019s first wife, Vanessa, was dumped for a younger woman after many years of marriage. Gone were all the trappings of wealth she had enjoyed as she struggles to put her life back in order. Forced to live with her aunt and take a job at Saks, Vanessa\u2019s thinks obsessively about Richard\u2019s new girlfriend, Nellie, while consuming large quantities of alcohol. When she inadvertently finds out that Richard plans to remarry, her fragile state of mind spirals out of control. The only thing she can think about is confronting Nellie for a face to face showdown. Nellie, by all appearances, seems like a sweet girl, perhaps a bit na\u00efve, completely smitten with her fianc\u00e9, Richard. She can\u2019t wait to start her new, \u2018dream come true' life with her dashing, successful husband. But, she, too, may have a few dark secrets lurking in her past. But, unbeknownst to Nellie, she is being watched, even stalked by a woman whose driving force in life is to prevent her wedding from ever taking place. The author did a fantastic job of doling out just the right amount of information at key intervals, subtly changing the dynamics of the story by giving the reader another possible angle to explore. My initial impressions of the situation presented to me, morphs little by little, as pieces of the puzzle are slowly revealed. Once the entire jigsaw puzzle is complete, the picture staring back at me, looks nothing at all like what I was expecting. This story has a few surprises I never saw coming. The only minor let down was that the plot had a few similarities to another book I\u2019d read just a few weeks ago, which deflated the balloon a little, but not too much, because it didn\u2019t become obvious until I was already very deep into the book. The truth is, the author kept me guessing and on my toes pretty much from start to finish. I was a bit conflicted about the final turn of the screw. I usually love all that added relish on top, but lately those late minute plot twists are becoming all too common, making them more tiresome than anything else and falling flat, as a result. In this case, the story could have ended quite satisfactorily without that final revelation, but I suppose, since it was a complete shock to me, I must grudgingly concede my approval for sneaking that one by me completely undetected. Overall, I\u2019m not sure I was as blown away by this one as my contemporaries, but this is a very solid, highly entertaining domestic thriller, and is certainly worth checking out. 4 stars*Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Evgnossia O'Hara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43416866-evgnossia-o-hara", "userReview": "Review was originally published on Through the Chapters|Blog*3 stars*Have you heard about the ironic process theory which deals with the attempts to suppress certain thoughts and by this means make them more likely to surface?For example, imagine a situation where someone tells you not to think about pink elephants. So, what are you doing? You are thinking about those pink elephants. You picture them in your mind in all their glory and even when you try to think of something else they invade into your thoughts again. Ironic, isn\u2019t it?So, when I\u2019ve read the synopsis of \u201cThe Wife Between Us\u201d and have been warned to\n\nAssume nothing\n\n What did I do? I was assuming, I was wondering, I was guessing, non-stop, throughout the story. Guess what. I figured out the first plot twist which had to blow my mind away. But it just didn\u2019t happen since I was warned to assume nothing. See? The ironic process theory.Let\u2019s put first things firsts. I was craving to read this book the first time I saw it on Goodreads. The cover was intriguing; the reception of my Goodreads friends astonishing, and the synopsis made me assuming theories even before I had the change to read the first line.Generally speaking, the story deals with two young women, an ex-wife and a bride to be. Vanessa and Nellie. They both are in love with Richard, an accomplished man who can protect the woman of his life. Vanessa, the jealous ex-wife, is not ready to let him continue with his life and marry Nellie. As a result, she\u2019s trying to prevent this marriage no matter the cost and the consequences. I won\u2019t tell something else on the plot as I don\u2019t want to spoil you. You\u2019d better go into it, knowing as less as possible.To continue with my reading experience, some may thing that the first part of the story was a little bit dragged but it was essential for the writers to construct the background of the main characters and lead to the main plot twist. The same plot twist that I figured out in the early stage of my reading. Needless to say, I was disappointed; I didn\u2019t have the chance to feel this turmoil that good turns of events produce.Nonetheless, I was still yearning for the development of the story and was waiting for the next plot twist in order to compensate myself. I have to confess that some lines in the novel such as\u2026\nI never been the woman he thought he\u2019d married.\nand\u2026\nThey say the wife is always the last to know.\n\u2026made me eager to keep reading, to keep turning the pages, just to learn what happens next, where the story will lead me, but at the same time I was assuming again. And again I was somehow right. What is the problem with me?Still, I was waiting for the great plot twist until the very last page, till the very last sentence. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t struck with amazement. There were another one plot twist but I was completely uninterested in that one. To tell more, it was unnecessary as it didn\u2019t change anything in my already thorough opinion. The only thing I wanted to do was:I have to acknowledge some positive aspects of the novel. The writing was flawless; the characters were multidimensional with past and secrets that made me to continue reading. It was a generator of controversial emotions. I felt compassion, anger, happiness and even malice. I cannot also omit the message that the story provides us with. You will understand after reading the book.\n\nThat\u2019s why I love reading. A book is not only a good story or a shocking plot twist; it is a journey, a message, a lesson, a life, a powerful and deep gift which speaks a different truth to each and every one of us.\n\nWith those in mind, if you decide to read \u201cThe Wife Between Us\u201d, do not stay at the \u201cassume nothing\u201d, cause you will activate your mind to assume everything and in all likelihood to guess the main twist or a part of it. But if we\u2019ll take under consideration the theory, you have already arguably aroused your mind to assume, guess and judge.

A twister blister formed in my poor brain and it was ready to burst! This thriller had a twist that made me think three things, explanations that jumped fast around inside my head, irritating the hell out of the blister: Either I was an absolute dummy, or I had meandered into the Twilight Zone, or the publisher (or editor) had made a mistake that was mammoth and unforgiveable. My 10-step journey:1. Was going along just fine, enjoying this fast-moving thriller. La-dee-da, la-dee-da. 2. Got hit. WHAP! What just happened???? I was about halfway through. Surely all will be made clear in a second. But it wasn\u2019t. I should understand. But I don\u2019t. Way too confusing!3. Reread pages. At first, I did so patiently, though nervously. Nothing clicked. A book should not be this hard! 4. Reread the pages a few dozen more times. I kept at it. Reread these sentences, carefully, I told myself, they WILL make sense. They always do in the end. But I was losing my dear patience. I was mad, I tell you. How could they do this to me? Despite my attempt at soothing self-talk, this book continued to make NO sense.5. Paced. Okay, I\u2019m a sitter, not a pacer. For this sitter to actually pace in the middle of reading a book is an unheard-of event. I usually just sit still and let my head (instead of my legs) do the work. As I clomped through my all-in-a-row living room, dining room, and kitchen (a nice straight place to pace), I tried desperately to figure out what was going on in this book that had hooked me from the start. I had pretty much settled on the idea that of the three possibilities, I was a dummy, unfit to handle a twist in a stupid book (because by this time, I was defensively calling the book \u201cstupid\u201d).6. Paced some more. I don\u2019t remember it clearly (due to stress, which often obliterates memory), but I\u2019m pretty sure I was cussing by this point. I should have been wearing a pedometer.7. Loaded the dishwasher. The hell with this book, I\u2019ll do my chores. Doing the dishes never seemed so pleasant.8. Sat back down. Should I abandon this book? Throw my Kindle across the room? (Not a smart idea to throw an electronic device, so I nixed it.) I was really pissed off. A book should not make me this mad or be this hard. My head hurt. Maybe I should call a friend and just forget about this dumb story.9. Reread pages one last time. Okay, I\u2019ll try, but that\u2019s it\u2014no more. 10. And then\u2026.OMG, I get it!!!! I get it!!!! I love this book! This twist is genius!! I felt like I had found the last piece in a 3,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. I was all cocky now that I had finally understood, and I could not stop marveling at the ingenuity of it. The authors winked at me. I winked back.So that was my frustrating journey. I was exhausted, both mentally and physically. But then I started reading like a mad fool; my energy was renewed. Plus my dishes were done and I had had a little exercise. It\u2019s about time that I mentioned what the book is about: A scorned, obsessed ex-wife whose ex-husband is about marry again, is stalking the new fianc\u00e9. There are some good secrets about everyone\u2019s past. As I read on, though, I realized that no twist could outdo that first one. That first humdinger was a twist of a different kind, but I\u2019m not going to elaborate. I don\u2019t want to give anything away.The twists continued. What fun to have a stream of them, not just one. Most books don\u2019t come with a variety. I could not stop reading. In fact, I read this book in two days, which is super fast for me. But yes, there was a bit of a letdown, only because that first twist was so grand. Also, the characters were somewhat stereotypical at first. Even some of the twists seemed a little familiar. But there were surprises that were new. The Epilogue was really good, for instance. Really good.I do think this book might be a blockbuster. Unlike in Gone Girl, however, the language didn\u2019t slay me; it was pretty pedestrian. I liked that there were no wasted words, though. As an ex-editor, I\u2019m fascinated by the fact that this was written by two people. I can\u2019t imagine how that worked.This book is being brought to the big screen. I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out how that first twist will be handled\u2014sure hope they don\u2019t have to ditch it, because the movie wouldn\u2019t be as great without it. I\u2019m definitely lining up to see the movie, though. I recommend this book because of all the twists. As the blurb says, assume nothing, because nothing, and I mean nothing, is as it seems. I definitely thought it was a lot of fun, despite the pain of my twister blister.

A second's turn of your back and your identity is gone. Claimed by another or still existing in a look-alike world. Here and then gone......Vanessa Thompson awakens in the tiny guestroom in her Aunt Charlotte's apartment. Her marriage is over and the aftermath is like shattered glass with the pieces of her remaining life never quite fitting together again. Examining the fragments will only initiate the bleeding once more. A promise of retrieving the hidden wine bottles in her closet at the end of the day gives her the impetus to dress for her retail job at Saks. She also walks a tightrope there with impending dismissal looming because of her constant days off.Richard had all the fine cut and polish of the successful man on the cover of GQ. His position as a hedge fund manager brought them the finer things in life. What could possibly go wrong with perfection? Vanessa asks herself if her skittish behavior was due to the fertility medications she was taking after constant unsuccessful episodes. Was it the fear of retribution from a horrendous haunting situation that occured in her senior year of college? Or was it simply that wine glass that beckoned to be constantly refilled?Startling news drifts in Vanessa's direction as the realization comes that Richard is to be remarried soon. One thing that Vanessa knows for sure is that that is not going to happen. Weak in mind, heart, and spirit, Vanessa is determined to get Richard's attention. One way or another.Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen present a storyline carved out with mega twists and turns. The eyes tend to deceive in this one. I mean, really deceive. That lipstick smudge on that wine glass may not actually be yours. Then where is yours and where is theirs? Guess you're going to have to crack this one open to see for yourself.

Maybe 3.25?\"In my marriage, there were three truths, three alternate and sometimes compelling realities. There was Richard's truth. There was my truth. And there was the actual truth, which is always the most elusive to recognize. This could be the case in every relationship that we think we've entered into a union with another person when, in fact, we've formed a triangle with one point anchored by a silent but all-seeing judge, the arbiter of reality.\"Vanessa's marriage is over. She once had a handsome, rich, powerful husband, and they lived a life of luxury. But they drifted apart, and her husband found another woman. Now she lives with her aunt, wears out-of-date clothing, and is a shell of herself, working a job she hates just to make ends meet.Nellie is a bubbly, young, beautiful preschool teacher. She's finally met her Prince Charming, the man who will rescue her from her messy shared apartment, her nights spent as a cocktail waitress (even though she enjoys them), and takeout meals before hanging out with her friends at various bars and clubs. She also has secrets of her own, and things that cause her to be afraid, and she hopes her fianc\u00e9 will save her from those, too.If you think \nThe Wife Between Us\n is a story about a jilted wife jealous of her husband's new fianc\u00e9e, you're not quite right. This is a story about how things are seldom as simple as they seem, and how appearances can be deceiving. It's also a story about trust, fear, truth, manipulation, and finding your own way.Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen throw a lot of twists into this book, which is why my description is fairly spartan, because I don't want to spoil anything for you. Every time you think you have things figured out, they swerve again, so you definitely want to keep reading, to see where it all winds up.There are a lot of thrillers out there these days, and many of them deal with relationships that don't go as planned, and the aftermath of breakups, as well as the manipulation that often occurs within a relationship. While the twists definitely jolted the plot a bit, overall I felt a lot of the plotlines were very familiar. At times, I found myself growing a little impatient with the pace of the story, because I wanted to see where Hendricks and Pekkanen would go next, and wanted to move past some of the more commonplace incidents.Is this a compelling thriller? It definitely has its moments, and many of my Goodreads friends have raved about this, so maybe I've just read too many books in this genre this year. It did keep me guessing, though, and sometimes I was right, and sometimes I was wrong. This will probably be one of the beach reads of 2018, so don't let me dissuade you from picking it up.NetGalley and St. Martin's Press provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

It seemed like everyone was loving it, so I went straight to NetGalley and put in my request. After I started reading it, I didn\u2019t want to put it down. I thought for sure I knew where the story was going. It felt slow to me, but I hung on until nearly halfway through when the first major twist was introduced. I was shocked! I was so very surprised and befuddled thinking that I\u2019d skipped something or that I was lost. It seemed unique and interesting, but as time went on, I became disentranced and my mind began to wonder away from the story. The characters became confusing to me and the plot felt all over the place. It was like I wanted to get to the ending to see how things would unfold, but there simply wasn\u2019t anything going on to captivate me. At times, I felt like there was too much information and in other places, simply not enough. I didn\u2019t feel like it was horribly predictable as there were plenty of twists and a strange reveal at the end, but even with all the crazy twists, this just ended up being an okay read for me and it just didn\u2019t feel like a thriller.I did still enjoy it and feel like this is going to be a favorite for many people!

The Wife Between Us is an angst driven, clever, gripping, suspenseful and not your typical domestic psychological thriller novel that was an absolutely thrilling and exciting read. We went into this one thinking we were going to be prepared to look outside of the box and figure out some of those shocking twists. We had our game on and we were on the lookout for those clues that were so brilliantly executed with only Norma picking up on one right from the start. Brenda should have too!It started off a bit slow as we were waiting to pick up on those oh so subtle clues, and the questions started building up for us. We thought we were ready and then the first shocking and unforgettable twist came and we all were left speechless with only one word to say, \u201cWOW\u201d. Well except for Norma who was feeling pretty proud of yourself for picking up on the clue for that one. After that initial shock we started questioning how the authors were going to pull it off with this twisty plot and we really enjoyed the discussion that brought on.Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen have done such a fantastic job here with this complicated, complex and compelling storyline, creating a fascinating unreliable character here with Vanessa. We questioned her motives, her history and her husband and their relationship. We didn\u2019t know who to trust and we tried not to make assumptions and that left us questioning everyone. The authors do such a great job with this unique and riveting novel, cleverly revealing the right pieces of the puzzle to us at the right time which were so brilliantly delivered. Allowing us to only see those pieces after reading it and leaving us discussing just how cleverly plotted this story really was.

Picking up this book I was a bit hesitant because who hasn't read over and over again that this will be the next Gone Girl or Girl on the Train only to be a bit of a disappointed? Well The Wife Between Us didn't promise to be the next anything but guess what, I think I finally found the one that surpassed the promises regardless. The book starts readers off by introducing them to Vanessa, the wife that was. Vanessa is struggling to recover after her marriage and losing all that she once had all the while worrying and wondering what her husband is now doing. Then we meet Nellie, the wife that will be. Who do we root for? Who do we hate? As we dive into these characters feelings will form and thoughts on how the story will go will pop into your head but whatever you think you know, think again. With so many twists it will make your head spin this book is sure to keep readers on their toes. Each part of this story is told in sections during the book and with each section I was scratching my head and wondering if I had read things right. These authors certainly found a way to confuse and confound readers and make them love every minute of it. We as readers all hear the phrases unputdownable and a definite page turner all the time but how often do those actually come true? Well, I'd highly suggest if you are looking for that next jaw dropping read you really should pick up a copy of The Wife Between Us. I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.wordpress...."}], "description": "A novel of suspense that explores the complexities of marriage and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.
