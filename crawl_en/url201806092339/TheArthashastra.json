The text of this extraordinarily detailed manual contains fifteen books which cover numerous topics viz., the King; a complete code of law; foreign policy; secret services; civic responsibilities,\u00a0and so on.In trying to understand Kautilya's analysis, we have to keep in mind the fact that in the Kautilyan view, the king encapsulates all the constituents of a state, he has expounded the theory in terms of the king - any king. In other words, what Kautilya calls the 'interest of the king' would nowadays be termed 'National Interest'.A Note About The TranslationThis translation by Rangarajan\u00a0is a good reference book if you are coming back to Arthashastra for reference, but not particularly good for a first reading. It is too well catalogued and too practical for that. The verses should be read in the order Kautilya arrayed than in this re-arranged fashion that helps to make much better sense of ti, but somehow takes away the spirit.The translation also contains a useful Index of Verses (By Textual Order) \u2014 it is meant to assist in finding out in which Part and Section a particular verse of the text has been included.\nThe Branches Of Knowledge\nTraditionally, in classical Indian texts, the four branches of knowledge are considered to be:1) Philosophy, 2) The Three Vedas, 3) Economics, and 4) The Science of GovernmentKautilya tells us that these are, indeed, the four fundamental branches of knowledge because one can know from these four branches of study all that is to be learnt about \nDharma\n [spiritual welfare] and \nArtha\n [material well-being]. {1.2.8-9}Artha, literally wealth, is thus one of four supreme aims prescribed by Classical Indian tradition. However, it has a much wider significance and the material well-being of individuals is just a part of it. The \u2018Artha\u2019 of Arthashastra is an all-embracing word with a variety of meanings.\u00a0 In accordance with this, Kautilya's Arthashastra maintains that the state or government of a country has a vital role to play in maintaining the material status of both the nation and its people.The Arthashastra is thus 'the science of politics' with a significant part dedicated to the science of economics. It is the art of government in its widest sense \u2014 the maintenance of law and order as also of an efficient administrative machinery The subjects covered include: administration; law order and justice; taxation, revenue and expenditure; foreign policy; defense and war. Its three objectives follow one from the other: promotion of the welfare of the subjects leads to acquisition of wealth which, in turn, makes it possible to enlarge the territory by conquest.\nThe Instruction Manual\nThe Arthashastra is essentially a treatise on the art of government and is, by nature, instructional. It seeks to instruct all kings and is meant to be useful at all times wherever dharma is held to be pre\u00ademinent. And because it is instructional, it is basis is the practice of government. The majority of the treatise is a Manual of Instruction for kings and officers of the state.There are three distinct parts in this manual:1. The \nManual of Admi\u00adnistration\n describes the organization of the apparatus of the state and prescribes the duties and responsibilities of every key official, either for maintaining order or for collecting revenue. There are, naturally, parts devoted to budgetary control, enforcement of civil service dis\u00adcipline and the public's civic responsibility.2. The \nCode of Law and Justice\n covers both civil and criminal law and is, basically, a Penal Code; the extensive and graded penalties and fines prescribed in it have the twin aims of deterring transgressions and collecting revenue for the state.3. The third part is a \nManual of Foreign Policy\n, the pri\u00admary aim of which is acquisition of territory by conquest.These three manuals correspond to the three objectives of the state - wealth, jus\u00adtice and expansion \u2014 A stable and prosperous state, which only a just administration can secure, is a prerequisite for accumulation of wealth which is then used to augment the territory.Justice \u2014> Wealth \u2014> Expansion \u2014> More Wealth, and so on... ... as long as Justice is not compromised. Which is why the prime focus of The Arthashastra is good administration that ensures the perpetuation of justice and prosperity in the kingdom.\nAgainst Reductionist Arguments\nBefore we move on, we should face the unfortunate fact that both Kautilya the author and his masterwork the Arthashastra are much misunderstood. Popularly known as Chanakya, he is maligned and often ridiculed as a teacher of unethical, not to say immoral, practices and as an advocate of the theory that 'the ends justify the means.' 'Chanakyan' has entered Indian vocabulary as the equivalent of 'Machiavellian'.Most people know little of what Kautilya actually said in the Arthashastra. The only thing they can recall is the superficial aspects of the \u2018mandala\u2019 theory, based on the principles: 'Every neighboring state is an enemy and the enemy's enemy is a friend.' This is, no doubt, almost always valid. Nevertheless, to reduce Kautilya's theory on foreign policy to just these two observations is to do him a grave injus\u00adtice. Indeed, the theory deals with not just three states, but with a twelve.\u00a0Here is a sample of how much more nuanced that simple understanding could be, with a little effort:This popular view is not only simplistic but untrue. A through reading of the treatise is required to appreciate the range and depth of the Arthashastra. It is a pioneering work on statecraft in all its aspects, written at least one thousand five hundred years ago.Even the condemnation of Kautilya as an unethi\u00adcal teacher and the equivalence established with Machiavelli (itself based on gravely erroneous conception of that great master!) is based on ignorance of his work.Kautilya\u2019s is always a sane, moderate and balanced view. He placed great emphasis on the welfare of the people. His practical advice is rooted in dharma. But, as a teacher of practical statecraft, he advocated unethical methods in the furtherance of national interest, but always with very strict qualification. But these are often ignored or just plain unknown to the majority.Just as Kautilya's important qualifications to his advocacy of unethical methods is often ignored, so is the voluminous evidence in the Arthashastra of his emphasis on welfare, not only of human beings but also of animals. Welfare in the Arthashastra is not just an abstract concept. It covers maintenance of social order, increasing economic activity, protection of livelihood, protection of the weaker sections of the population, prevention of harassment of the subjects, consumer protection and even welfare of slaves and prisoners.In short, the Arthashastra is a mixture of both what we applaud today and what we consider to be reprehensible. Kautilya has a great deal to say about civic responsibility; the obligation of every householder to take precautions against fire is mentioned; so is a prohibition on cutting trees in public parks. Consumer protection and vigilance against ex\u00adploitation of the people by government servants are aspects which we consider good. Equally, some of Kautilya's suggestions will be seen by us as unethical. What is essential is that we understand both aspects and use them to learn history as well as to apply to the modern situations.\nThe Kautilyan Conception of The State\nDr. Kangle, in his magisterial work on Kautilya, notes that 'the kind of state control over the economy Arthashastra presupposes is not possible without an efficient administra\u00adtion. We, therefore, find in it a description of an elaborate administra\u00adtive machinery.'A ruler's duties in the internal administration of the country are three-fold: raksha or protection of the state from external aggression, palana or maintenance of law and order within the state, and yoga\u00adkshema or safeguarding the welfare of the people. These duties also meant that the King needed an elaborate support system.The highly centralized Kautilyan state was to be regulated by an elaborate and intricate system as laid out by Kautilya. While at first glance we might think that this high centralization is repulsive, we should also appreciate the difficulties of the time. Most of the empires of the world relied on tight centralization to ensure some degree of success. Also, in Kautilya\u2019s eyes, everything was in the service of one goal: Justice.The extensive responsibilities of the state for promoting economic wellbeing and preserving law and order demand an equally extensive administrative machinery.\u00a0 Any text on Arthashastra thus has to contain details of the organization of the civil service as well as the duties and responsibilities of individual officials.Thus we can see how The Arthashastra was bound to be an elaborate manual that dealt with every minute aspect of administration and daily life.The Arthashastra is a through discussion on the science of living, along with being a valuable historical document on the conduct of administration. It is thus supremely valuable for the historian but also for a modern political scientist or sociologist or economist or administrator.\nA Modern Kautilya\nAll this shows us how close to modern life and administration the Kautilyan ideas come. Reading ancient books is the best way to rid ourselves of modernist fantasies \u2014 except for communication and transport, in the basic institutions, we are still where we were. and it is these two things (advance in communication & transport) that has made our institutions slightly more efficient, but also a lot more complex and thus just as bad at dealing with real things, while giving the illusion of a lot of activity.The same thing can be said of the role of technology in daily life as well. We can get more things done because we can, but precisely because we can, there are always more things to do. The Red Queen\u2019s laugh reverberates through our modern lives and modern states.\nReality And The Ideal\nThe picture of the ideal Kautilyan state that emerges from our discussion above is one of a well-run state, prosperous and bustling with activity. But if we are to comprehend clearly Kautilya's teachings and apply them judiciously to the modern world, we also have to be aware of the essential characteristics of the work. The treatise is about an ideal state - not that such a state actually ever existed or is even likely to exist now or in the future. To the extent any of the six constituent elements of a state - the ruler, the ministers, the urban and the rural population, the economic power and the military might - differ from the ideals Kautilya has set out, to that extent the advice given by him has to be modified.I cannot imagine that much would change if a modern Kautilya were to write an Arthashastra today, except that he would have a broader, faster reach, and a better chance of enforcing things. But the basics of what he wants to do would not change much, nor would the how, only the means/instruments of effecting them would be easier., But unless those means are not available to the people, their range also increases, and hence real control would remain as difficult today as it was then.\nThe Illusion of Governance?\nThis realization should lead us to wonder why Kautilya attempted such an elaborately and minutely planned state architecture \u2014 we should consider the possibility that perhaps this level of intrusion into daily life was required, at least at the planning level, precisely because real control was so impossibly difficult? Maybe the Plan was needed for any semblance of governance? This reminds me strongly of Kafka\u2019s Castle administration and their reliance on the awe of the villagers. Maybe the illusion of minute micro-managed and all-pervasive governance can cover up for the inability to really govern?Isn\u2019t it the same today?\nThe Best in the Market\nWe have seen that the Arthashastra is an exhaustive and detailed inventory of everything a state should do and everything every minor official should do. A more detailed secular constitution of governance and daily life cannot be imagined. With this legacy, it is no wonder that the much less ambitious Indian Constitution is still the longest in the world, the most detailed and most concerned with trying to micro manage the nuts and bolts of administration.We have also seen how the problems that Kautilya tried to tackle are more or less the same as what modern states fail spectacularly at, even when aided by more gee-whiz technology. And this immutability of problems and of solutions is precisely why the level of detail that Kautilya goes into is still valuable for government officials, administrators and citizens.A better guidebook has not hit the market yet."}, {"userName": "Hadrian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian", "userReview": "For a more complete review, you'd likely be better off looking at my friend Riku's excellent remarks here. He's made the effort of writing a more comprehensive summary; I'll stick with a few brief comments.I'm reminded of a remark that President Kennedy made when he was forming his cabinet after the election in 1960. One of his top choices waffled about the decision, saying he wasn't qualified. Kennedy deferred by saying, \"There's no school for Presidents.\" Though that is still true, this is a book about how to be a king. It is, as noted elsewhere, exceedingly wide in scope. The book addresses such wide topics as resource management, the formation of a civil service, espionage, and the writing of treaties. Kautilya is strict in his definitions of terms - he knows that law is a cornerstone of the state, and refuses to allow ambiguity there.My knowledge of pre-industrial economics is lacking so I can't comment in detail about that, but I can vaguely praise his thoroughness. He does prescribe the conservation of natural resources such as forests and wild animals, which is a very astute remark for 2,300 years ago. The Romans did drive one of their more useful plant species to extinction and deforested almost the whole area around the Mediterranean, to show a negative counterexample. Much has been made about Kautilya's harsh reputation. It is true that he does advocate extensive spying both within and outside of the king's domain, but he does not relish in it. He just includes it as something worth knowing for every ruler. Although I obviously can't comment on the details of modern intelligence methods, I was surprised by the variety of his methods. Using spies posing as religious figures and people faking disabilities? Smart stuff.The Arthashastra's views on foreign policy (the 'Six-Fold Policy') is a clear forerunner to the modern school of 'realism', based on the premise that states act only in their own interests and how to advance their own interests. His concept of the 'silent war' is useful in that it describes states that are not openly at war, but attempt to undercut each other's interests through power plays and espionage. In any case, he views the establishment of a strong army as the foremost task of the state, as all other activities are impossible without the power to back them up.There's obviously a lot more to the Arthashastra than this (my copy was an abridged translation) but I was deeply impressed with what I did find. This is as thorough a manual in statecraft as can be found."}, {"userName": "Frank O'donnell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18100306-frank-o-donnell", "userReview": "This work is most commonly likened to Machiavelli, although it predates 'The Prince' by several centuries. With a similar attitude to statecraft to that of Machiavelli, this offers a far more comprehensive and detailed manual for realist power aggrandisment. It also differs from Machiavelli in its genuine concern for the welfare and economic prospects of domestic citizens, where Machiavelli dismisses such issues outright and instead advises that a king merely rule through fear. I would recommend this over Machiavelli as an introduction to classical realist thought, as it offers the more complete guide to how a ruler interested in power aggrandisement should govern both domestically and externally following realist principles."}, {"userName": "chaz2b", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1951297-chaz2b", "userReview": "- 061411 Kautilya's Arthashastra ebook http://bit.ly/joVEtJ-"}, {"userName": "Shinde", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8964611-shinde", "userReview": "Exhaustive and exhausting.

The content was interesting enough though and showed a lot of insight into the ancient empires of India. It was especially intereting to me, knowing almost nothing about indian history to find out how complex those old states were. This was probably the most interesting part of the book to me.

The translation provides much needed order and structure to this ancient text. The translator Rangarajan, after an in-depth study of the Arthashastra, recompiles the verses into meaningful chapters , constructs a flow which is agreeable to the modern mind and also does not lose the beauty of the poetry of the original.Many of the tedious parts of the text, i.e. lists, punishments, weights , measures, duties and responsibilities of different civic officials etc are all neatly compiled into tables for quick and easy understanding. Places where a visual representation would be useful are well identified and appropriate diagrams provided. Eg: battle formations, Fort/battle camp architecture etc.Finally , the text itself does not read like an ancient and irrelevant treatise, but is highly relatable to today's world and is in a way surprising and eye-opening for the fact that human society is very much the same for nearly 2000 years in its behavioral aspects and its dynamics as a society even though aspects like technology and morality have progressed.

Kautilya and Vishnugupta, the names by which the ancient Indian political treatise called the Artha\u015b\u0101stra identifies its author, are traditionally identified with Chanakya. Chanakya has been considered as the pioneer of the field of economics and political science. In the Western world, he has been referred to as The Indian Machiavelli, although Chanakya's works predate Machiavelli's by about 1,800 years. Chanakya was a teacher in Tak\u1e63a\u015bila, an ancient centre of learning, and was responsible for the creation of Mauryan empire, the first of its kind on the Indian subcontinent. His works were lost near the end of the Gupta dynasty and not rediscovered until 1915.Two books are attributed to Chanakya: Arthashastra and Neetishastra which is also known as Chanakya Niti. The Arthashastra discusses monetary and fiscal policies, welfare, international relations, and war strategies in detail. Neetishastra is a treatise on the ideal way of life, and shows Chanakya's in-depth study of the Indian way of life. Chanakya also developed Neeti-Sutras (aphorisms - pithy sentences) that tell people how they should behave. Of these well-known 455 sutras, about 216 refer to raaja-neeti (the do's and don'ts of running a kingdom). Apparently, Chanakya used these sutras to groom Chandragupt and other selected disciples in the art of ruling a kingdom.Arthashastra is divided into 15 books:1 Concerning Discipline2 The Duties of Government Superintendents3 Concerning Law4 The Removal of Thorns5 The Conduct of Courtiers6 The Source of Sovereign States7 The End of the Six-Fold Policy8 Concerning Vices and Calamities9 The Work of an Invader10 Relating to War11 The Conduct of Corporations12 Concerning a Powerful Enemy13 Strategic Means to Capture a Fortress14 Secret Means15 The Plan of a Treatise"}, {"userName": "Kannav Bhatia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18927143-kannav-bhatia", "userReview": "It is a good read, but requires lot of patience and interest.

It identifies its author by the names 'Kau\u1e6dilya' and 'Vishnugupta', both names that are traditionally identified with Chanakya (c. 350\u2013283 BC), who was a scholar at Takshashila and the teacher and guardian of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Mauryan Empire. The text was influential until the 12th century, when it disappeared. It was rediscovered in 1904 by R. Shamasastry, who published it in 1909. The first English translation was published in 1915.Roger Boesche describes the Artha\u015b\u0101stra as \"a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good.\"Centrally, Artha\u015b\u0101stra argues how in an autocracy an efficient and solid economy can be managed. It discusses the ethics of economics and the duties and obligations of a king. The scope of Artha\u015b\u0101stra is, however, far wider than statecraft, and it offers an outline of the entire legal and bureaucratic framework for administering a kingdom, with a wealth of descriptive cultural detail on topics such as mineralogy, mining and metals, agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine and the use of wildlife. The Artha\u015b\u0101stra also focuses on issues of welfare (for instance, redistribution of wealth during a famine) and the collective ethics that hold a society together.", "title": "The Arthashastra", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1769362.The_Arthashastra", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428846538l/1769362.jpg", "reviews": 35, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/868529.Kautilya", "name": "Kautilya"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1923171.L_N_Rangarajan", "name": "L.N.
