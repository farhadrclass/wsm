Eon opens as a near future artifact, or big-dumb-object, tale largely inspired by Rendezvous With Rama. The novel then progresses through a number of movements, each more mind-numbing and awe-inspiring than the previous. It is therefore no great surprise that the book eventually evolves (or devolves, depending on your point of view) from Hard Science Fiction to a form of Space Opera. Then, of course, there is the grand finale, which is really something else.Like the early Uplift novels by David Brin Eon seems to be a bridge between old school and the new as far as Science Fiction is concerned. I am by no means a buff. Anyway, I really enjoyed the novel. It embodies what I have come to love about Sci-Fi. There was a lot about the novel I didn't understand at all, but I was awed. Another work I was reminded of while reading this was Ringworld (Larry Niven). It was a challenge to envision what I was reading, but getting there is part of the thrill.Despite the dated cold war politics, which seems to be a grievance to some reviewers, this book did not seem dated at all. Considering the alternate universes and time-lines being casually tossed about here, that kind of thing shouldn\u2019t even be an issue. The focus did shift unexpectedly between characters from time to time, but I felt that this was in tune with the way the novel was constructed. Each new discovery leads to a new focus, until the discoveries spiral out of control and the reader is left breathless and stunned.A novel as ambitious and complicated as this is bound to draw negative criticism. I would never expect different. However, I would urge you to form your own opinion. So, if you enjoy artifacts in Science Fiction, this is mandatory reading. I have to agree with another reviewer - there are moments when you have to put the book down and just stare into space, assimilating. This is an experience, not a read.RecommendedFavourites"}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "Pronounced \"yawn\"."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "There's a thing in science fiction called the Big Dumb Object which always provokes awe and a sense of wonder and all that, and Eon is all about one of those. They're called big dumb objects because boys of all ages love them, their eyes go all glazey thinking about the size, power and size of these things and all the author has to do is make sure their alien object is really really big. Works every time. Boys love size \u2013 breasts, penises, brothers, breakfasts, all good as long as they're big. So, for instance, Rama in Arthur Clarke's Rama books is one, the Ringworld in Ringworld by Larry Niven is another, the house in House of Leaves is one, apparently there's a giant black hole known as the Unicron singularity in Transformers: Cybertron so that's another, and it goes on and on. Every invasion of earth has a big dumb object in the sky called a spaceship. So in Eon you get a big asteroid thing hanging up there in the sky which when they go and investigate they find it's bigger inside than it is outside.Ooooh.Probably things that are bigger inside than they are outside are just metaphors for the human brain.So it's the house in House of Leaves (which was the same house that was in House, an old horror movie from 1986) only it's in the sky with scientists. And plus, when the scientists go and explore it, or the guy in House of Leaves rides off on his bike to investigate the vastness of the House, it's like when kids in stories find doors in trees or in the back of wardrobes and they get to explore a magical kingdom. That part of it is probably all to do with sex, when you think about it. Eeek.I was a boy once and have never lost my liking for big dumb objects and secret doors and the frissons they can evoke."}, {"userName": "Mosca", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1837675-mosca", "userReview": "----------------------------------------------I've been amazed at the number of readers that have been so underwhelmed by Eon. This astounding book was published in 1984 and did not anticipate the end of the Cold War, only half a decade away. Some say, with self-righteousness nurtured by hindsight, that this is a major flaw in this book. But most sleepwalking Americans, at the time, had no clue of the Eurasian (and Eastern European) realities of the times. This is not Greg Bear\u2019s fault. It was, and is, the result of the political propaganda, still alive, fed to the public in large doses. What is forgotten is that from the Cold War assumptions seen by the average, contemporary, 1984 world citizens--however blind to the evident realities of Russian/Soviet internal decay and near collapse\u2014-the times still presented a very, very real global threat of planetary atomic annihilation. Some folks today, still argue that very similar, very real threats of atomic annihilation, fueled by other multi-polar realities (oil shortages, water shortages, cultural chauvinism, etc.), still exist and never really went away. And, for that reason alone, this book is still very contemporary. In fact, one can intelligently argue that mankind is still very, very close to destroying itself in a number of frighteningly different ways. The Cold War itself is immaterial to that threat of self-destruction.The near collapse of mankind, in the very near future, is the premise of this book by Greg Bear. This \"Hard Science\" Fiction, or \"New Space Opera\" speculates along the lines where mathematics and physics intersect with time and alternate realities. Greg Bear is not the superb master of characters and political speculation in which Ursula Le Guin - Left Hand of Darkness excels, nor is he a smooth story teller such as Ray Bradbury. But Greg Bear has followed the more traditional science fiction of Arthur C. Clarke. And on that path he excels.And in Eon he goes past Arthur C. Clarke. He shows us who this guy, Greg Bear really is. This book pulls the rug out from under the reader about 25% of the way into the reading; and I will not spoil that reality shift for you.And then you are taken places you have never been."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "\"Of course, \" she said. \"It's like touching the square root of space-time. Try to enter the singularity, and you translate yourself through a distance along some spatial coordinate.\" \"You slide along,\" Farley said. \"Right.\" \nI never tried touching the square root of space-time before so I cannot attest to whether it is in any way similar to trying to enter the singularity (which I have also never attempted for some reason). Still, as an avid sci-fi reader I like reading the odd bits of technobabble as long as they do not overwhelm the book to the point of rendering it unreadable. I like how Greg Bear makes that bit of dialog sound as if it makes sense. It\u2019s just cool (fits my conception of cool any way).Eon is a classic sci-fi book featuring one of the most beloved tropes of the genre, the Big Dumb Object. A gigantic alien construct that shows up in the vicinity of our Earth, the origin or purpose of which is unknown. It is interesting to compare Eon to Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s Rendezvous with Rama. Clarke\u2019s book is all about the B.D.O. and the group of characters\u2019 exploration and adventures inside of it. Explorations and adventures inside \u201cThe Stone\u201d (the name humans give to the gigantic asteroid shaped B.D.O.) are also featured in Eon but they constitute less than half of what this book is about. The fate of Earth and humanity also become involved as the USA claim prior right to manage the exploration and studies of The Stone on account of being the first nation to discover its appearance. This at a time when East-West relations are already precarious, and the Russians fear that the Americans would discover some kind of alien super-weapon to gain global dominance. Without wishing to go into details of the thrilling sci-fi wonders on offer I will just vaguely mention that nuclear holocaust, time travelling, parallel universes, posthumans and aliens all come into play. Eon is quite well written and the characters are developed to some extent but they never really come alive for me, perhaps there is too much plot and world building to cover to allow room to flesh out the characters. The pacing is a little slow to begin with but gathers momentum to become quite the pager turner by the second half of the book.Over all Eon is really an ideal book for fans of hard science fiction and those of us looking to escape from our daily drudgery for a while. There are two sequels and a short story which form The Way series. I have not read those yet but Eon stands very well on its own as there is no cliff hanger to speak of.

I really enjoyed the first half of Eon - mysteries and characters introduced and developed well, and some convincing and tense action and politics. I was convinced that Eon was going to be a really good read. Perhaps it was these early high hopes that caused my later disappointment.As the book progresses, things seems to unravel. The science behind the main premise of the story is presented in a reasonably convincing way, but some of the other scientific/technological \"advances\" are just silly and undermine the whole book - top of the list of offenders being \"The Mystery\", which made me cringe in a way I haven't cringed since Qui-Gon Jinn explained the Force via \"midichlorians\". And Bear really should have stopped to find out what it is actually like being a mathematician, before basing this story around a brilliantly gifted mathematician, then he might have been able to do something a little more convincing than have her lie down and close her eyes when it was time for her to work her magic.Towards the end of the book, the main characters completely lose control of the plot and seem to become little more than observers in the story, occasionally interjecting to point out that they understand (in the case of the mathematical genius) or don't understand (in the case of everyone else).It seemed that the end of this story was fixed about 100 pages before the end of novel, except for the minor twist that I found hard to care about - the main character dumped into a totally new and unresolved story arc. Clear set up, I presume, for a sequel. It was a page turner, but only because I wanted to get through a long drawn out explanation of events unfolding exactly as had been previously predicted.Whether you are looking for hard sci-fi or space opera, you'll probably be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Leo Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7619789-leo-robertson", "userReview": "Here's a parody of all the male-written sci-fi I abandon:They looked upon a very important object: it had lines and was a colour.

It was the awesomest thing I'd read to that point, and it remained awesome in my memory. I own a true first edition hardcover in fine condition\u2014actually pretty rare, especially in such good shape\u2014and it will remain one of the prized pieces of my book collection for a long time. Eon also will remain one of the seminal sci-fi works of the late-20th Century. In retrospect its influence on later works is clear, its position as a pioneering work solid. It helps that Greg Bear is a physicist and mathematician, and his knowledge impelled him to make use of modern theoretical physics in ways that previous sci-fi authors couldn\u2019t but which every subsequent author would attempt to emulate and tune to their own songs. The world building\u2014and here I must qualify, I mean in the Thistledown asteroid\u2014is fabulous. For those of you who haven't read Eon, the asteroid appears in our solar system from another universe, one closely paralleling our own, and enters orbit around Earth. We send people to investigate and discover seven hollowed-out chambers full of cities, forests, mountains, deserts, and machinery. The great wonder\u2014which you quickly discover so I'm not really spoiling anything\u2014is that the seventh chamber goes on forever. Re-reading this book I felt like I was entering through the bore-hole for the first time and experiencing the asteroid anew. I was there, in the Thistledown, one of the team, ready to explore and learn and add to scientific knowledge and grow closer to myself and my teammates. Then, when the war came, I felt the anguish and grief of The Death; I thought deeply about the horrors of nuclear weapons and the devastation they will someday bring.And yes, if you're wondering, I do believe that nuclear weapons, so long as we allow them to exist, pose a very real threat to the survival of our civilization. No weapon is ever designed not to be used. If nuclear weapons are never again used, it's because they've either been destroyed or superseded by something more horrible.Coming back down from my soapbox \u2026 Greg Bear's writing was very satisfying for me when I was younger. He conveys information effectively, dreams up creative storylines, and knows how to keep a plot moving. Now, having expanding my reading tastes\u2014and ability\u2014to a much broader spectrum of styles and authors, I find Bear's style a bit grating. Not too grating to read, but enough to make me chafe, like rubbing your palm on very fine sandpaper. Still, reading it again now, I thoroughly enjoyed Eon through the first 250-or-so pages. The plot was interesting and moved quickly. The characters were a little too obvious, a little to \"best-seller\" shallow for my taste, but they fit their environment and had plausible motivations and actions.Then, somewhere between page 250 and 300, things settled down. The story plateaued. Many mysteries were solved, most plot points wrapped up. The mysteries and plot points that remained unresolved were, to me, not so interesting anymore. The world-building became estranged, even contrived, though that may be a bit too harsh. It became more about the characters than the plot. Now, let's make sure we're on the same page, here. I love character studies. I'm okay with a slow-moving plot full of interesting characters. But, as I noted above, the characters in Eon aren't that interesting. They make sense, but there's no real mystery to them, not enough depth to explore, and so became predictable. Slow plot + predictable characters = Bo.Ring.However, even given the flaws and failings, I'm still glad I re-read Eon. It showed me how far my reading taste has evolved over the last 20 years. It helped me appreciate Eon in a way I couldn't as a young man, for the original work that it was. Re-reading Eon also was a nostalgic experience, helping me connect with my younger self, the self that developed a passion for sci-fi largely because of Eon and others of Greg Bear's novels. So, its flaws notwithstanding, Eon will retain is \"awesomest\" status in my memories."}, {"userName": "Jack +Books & Bourbon+", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21236687-jack-books-bourbon", "userReview": "Hmmmm...what to say about Eon? Ummmm...I finished it? Does that count? This was a selection for my local book club, as recommended by one of the members. The premise sounded interesting, and so I jumped right in. And...good lord...what a struggle. I'll admit that the first 1/4th of the book captivated me. The Stone was a cool mystery, and the science behind it was deep and engaging. But then the mysteries started being solved, and the book became less interesting. And as each new development happened, I found that I cared less and less. Look, I don't want to take away anything from Greg Bear. The dude can write the science part of speculative science fiction like nobody's business. But the first chunk of the book is basically exposition in real time, and most of what happens ultimately has little to no consequence to the rest of the story. The big cataclysmic event that takes place while our POV characters are on the Stone is so coldly rendered that it might as well have not even have happened.I commented to a fellow bookclub member that this book is very much a product of the time it was written. In fact, it feels like it should have been written more in the late 80's than the mid 90's, as the Cold War vibe is super strong, and the Russian antagonists just felt like lazy storytelling. Even when we were following events from the perspective of Russian soldiers, it felt like a low budget 80's action movie where every villain was villainous for the sake of being villainous. I might as well have been watching Red Dawn.As for the POV characters themselves, we head hop all over the board, and though I finished the book less than two weeks ago, I can't honestly remember any of the character's names. I get the impression that the human POV characters here are secondary to the technology and the alien characters. I never really connected with any of them, and even when they were in danger, I never really had an investment in their safety. The only time I was ever invested was when the rogue intelligence was meddling in the affairs of our human protagonists.Now this book isn't all bad. The technology is wonderfully thought out and described, the whole concept of the Stone and the Way are amazing, and Mr. Bear isn't lacking for ideas. This is a hell of a concept, even more so considering when it was first published. I can see why it's made such an impact in the sci-fi community. Sadly, I need more than just grand ideas in my sci-fi. I need compelling characters who interact with the cool technology. I need gravitas with my artificial gravity. I need some actual drama. And that was, in my opinion, sorely missing here. Based on what I've read here, I won't be revisiting this universe or characters.And yeah, that's all I've got to say about Eon."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1071724-simon", "userReview": "Imagine an alternate history in which the cold war hadn't ended in 1989 and had instead continued to intensify. And to add fuel to the fire a mysterious object arrived in our solar system from who knows where that America gets to first and controls access to. If the Soviets believed the Americans were learning secrets that would give them an edge, tensions might escalate out of hand. But it isn't giving the Americans a technological edge, only offers confounding mysteries and a devestating vision of their future that they seem powerless to avoid.This book, paradoxically, seemed both too long and too short. The overall story arc should either have been compressed down to a novel half the length or else fleshed out over two or three volumes. The sheer number of characters, minor story arcs, and mind boggling concepts explored was too much for a single book. Many of which could have been stripped out of the overall story without losing anything particularly important. On the other hand, more time could have been allowed to develop the many characters and their own story lines, the esoteric concepts more carefully explored if it was spread out over several books. Thus, it might be said, it falls between two stools. In particular, the last hundred pages or so was devoid of narrative tension as the story trundled to what seemed it's innevitable conclusion.Another problem I had was visualising everything as it was described. I don't know if it was the author's use of words that made it difficult for me or if it was the sheer amount and complexity of strange environments, technologies and geometries presented to the reader to get their head around. Perhaps some maps, schematic diagrams and a glossary of characters might have been useful for reference.That said, this was a visionary, ambitious work of SF that was crammed full of ideas which is precisely what SF should be doing.

I came up a bit short there, as there really isn't much of a plot, at least, not in the first 400 pages. I would say that all but one of the main characters we meet are NEVER instigators of major action in the plot, and we ultimately find out that ALL of the actions of the main characters is rendered moot by the out-of-left-field ending.

I really liked Moving Mars and also Darwin's Radio and they are among my favorites by him to this day. Eon is one of those \"asteroid hurtling toward Earth\" books. There was a cluster of these types of books in the late 70's and throughout the 80's. Eon tells the story of one such asteroid, but this one has a twist. Apparently the inside of the asteroid is hollowed out and contains seven chambers wherein lie different \"cities\" or abandoned settlements. It is later determined that the asteroid may have traveled from another time and may be a sort of homemade generation ship for a fleeing civilization. I really enjoyed Eon and I'm a sucker for any type of archaeological science-fiction like this. My only complaint is that there is a Cold-War race to examine the asteroid that now feels very dated.

I pretty much liked its basic core idea. But was disappointed with things: too much of political stance to it, and too much of physical descriptions of technology and its workings. Having written in the late Cold-war period, this has its echoes to it, reverberating nearly throughout the story. But eventually I for one did not really like the amount of this idea that is focused upon in an SF book. The technologies by itself are very interesting. However their excessive descriptions regarding their functions and physical make-up was a complete let-down and became boring to me very quickly. Eon also did not have much of the morally contemplative ideas that I usually love to have in any SF title. Barely one or two of those here and there.Also, it seems that Mr. Bear was partly inspired by the huge alien ship from the Rama series, which were compiled in Rama: The Omnibus, written by the wonderful Arthur C. Clarke. These were awesome and very-well written with good and perfect amount of descriptions, in comparison to Eon.I will eventually be reading its sequel sometime soon.

Clarke, indeed when an asteroid appears in a nova-like burst of radiation and sails neatly into an orbit round the Earth and Moon, one is instantly reminded of Rendez-vous with Rama, but this artifact is not alien. The Clarke tradition is to take an Idea then build a story round it; this can lead to novels that really don't have a good story or even much of a story at all, for example, Niven's Ringworld. With Eon, Bear does not suffer this problem; he tells a story that leads straight from extrapolation of the consequences of the Idea he had. It's a clever story and never boring but its one weakness is that it uses several major characters in order to cover all aspects and veiwpoints of the narrative.

The use of the word(s) USSR dates a sci-fi novel like a yellow stove-fridge combo dates a kitchen. Many SF authors have incredible technical imagination but for some that does not translate into visionary political views. I contrast that to Iain M. Banks' Culture, which is decidedly a communism-gone-right society, with all the hypocracy to boot. Having some of its novels also written in the 1980s, the Culture series still makes us think critically about political systems. In Eon, I half-expected Gorbachev to don a space helmet and explore the Stone. Anyways, putting the yellow fridge aside...Story: The USA and USSR (sigh) are about to nuke each other early in the 21st century. Suddenly a huge asteroid shows up in the solar system. Upon exploration, we discover that the asteroid is hollow, has artificial gravity and is divided up into seven huge chambers, some of which contain cities. No spoilers here but the interior size of the asteroid is really what is interesting. The characters: I read this a couple of years ago, and the characters were flat, so I remember little about them. The flounder: I mostly liked this story minus the Gorbachev factor, but at some point after the Way, it floundered. Something to do with a non-human character if I recall. Oh yes, it floundered.The bottom line: Not a lesson in style, a little dated, flattish characters, a Rama-rip but with more moving parts, and a flounder.

On second reading, I question why I liked it. Oh, that's right, I was 17. Now I know.The plot of EON is complicated, both in its science and in the political relationships between characters. Everything starts as a mysterious asteroid enters Earth orbit, and an expedition sent by the west discovers that it was built by humans of the future and somehow sent back in time unintentionally. Museums on the asteroid chronicle a future war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The most awe-inspiring facet of the book, however, is where the inhabitants of the asteroid disappeared to, leaving the cities there abandoned. Bear's writing is atrocious. Dialogue is clunky and unrealistic, there are some really absurdly penned sex scenes, and his description of the characters is formulaic. The portrayal of the Russians is incredibly stereotypical, and Bear never misses a chance to beat the reader over the head with the message that communism was wrong and the U.S. right during the Cold War. With the non-English characters he makes numerous mistakes. The author writes a traditional ideogram to describe a Chinese character's shirt when the PRC has used simplified forms for fifty years. The Hellenic rulers of Egypt are confused with the indigenous Egyptians. Apparently, the author did little research outside of the hard sciences. It is really a shame that the writing is so poor, because the concepts introduced here are fantastic. Alternate geometries, new forms of human society in the far-future, aliens some familiar and others inherently unknowable. The author's portrayal of a nuclear holocaust is harrowing but thought-provoking."}, {"userName": "Ethan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/812997-ethan", "userReview": "This is exactly what I was looking for when I was in the mood for some good 80's sci fi. Bear is a \"hard\" sci-fi writer - a lot of science, not so much in the way of character development. Actually, Bear's characters are developed fairly decently, but his best efforts come in his mind-expanding scientific/philosophical speculation. I honestly don't know enough math or physics to follow some of what he was talking about, but the basic ideas are pretty mind blowing, which is what good sci-fi should do. My main criticisms are that sometimes I got lost in the scientific or political details and, while I liked the weirdness, sometimes the book got a little too weird to tell what was going on, especially in the last 200 pages. Also, Bear was strangely obsessed with the sexuality of one of the secondary male characters. There were two points when women threw themselves at him at awkward times (once I actually blurted out, \"oh, for fuck's sake\"). Overall though, if you can overlook a few bad moments, deal with a book set in the future that's now the past (2005) in which the Soviet Union still exists and add a heavy dose of weird math and physics, you're in for a crazy ride."}, {"userName": "Ben Babcock", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-ben-babcock", "userReview": "Big Dumb Objects always provide an interesting starting point. The Stone, as the Americans christen the hollowed-out asteroid that appears above 21st-century Earth in Eon, is full of mysteries. It has the exact same profile as Juno, but much less mass, because someone has hollowed it out into seven enormous chambers. Could it be from humanity\u2019s future? Or a possible future? And if so, does it hold the answers to avert a Russian-American nuclear confrontation?Oh, 1980s. Your cold war fiction is so cute.I say this not with derision but admiration and a healthy dose of humility. I can only hope that, in thirty years\u2019 time, we will be saying similar things about contemporary science fiction that deals with possible apocalyptic global warming scenarios. We can\u2019t fault authors for working within the zeitgeist of their times and attempting to explore the ramifications of our ability to use and misuse advanced technology. Instead, the more pertinent question is what does Greg Bear want to say about politics and human nature?Politics and human nature are the crux of Eon. They inform both conflicts: the tension between the Russians and the Americans, which culminates in an invasion of the Stone that goes pear-shaped faster than you can say, \u201can invasion of the Stone that goes pear-shaped\u201d; and the meetings between the 21st-century humans and their alternate-future counterparts from Axis City. In both cases, we have two groups that are not necessarily enemies but have very different ideas of how to achieve their goals. We have different individuals within these groups, individuals whose own ideologies are more nuanced and refined than the general group identity. Bear emphasizes that just because one belongs to a group doesn\u2019t mean one\u2019s own identity and choices are subsumed into that group.Human nature is an interesting one, because many of the inhabitants of Axis City wouldn\u2019t fall under our definition of \u201chuman\u201d. Decidedly posthuman, they have mastered the arts of mind uploading, cloning and body creation, etc. A sizable portion exist as \u201cneomorphs\u201d, embodied but in forms far more diverse and bizarre than that of the human body; more still exist only as personalities within the City Memory. And so one must wonder the extent to which these people still possess \u201chuman nature\u201d, whatever that might be. Decoupled from all those hormones and chemicals that make us who we are, are we still us?Bear seems very focused on writing realistic humans, and it pays off. All of the various characters are well-rounded, an important attribute when one has such a large ensemble cast. I just wish they were a little more interesting. For example, Patricia is supposed to be a brilliant mathematician whose theories precede those that enable the construction of the Stone\u2019s seventh chamber and the Way. But she spends most of the book in some kind of haze, as if she can\u2019t quite believe what\u2019s happening. This seems like an all-too-realistic response to discovering that descendants from a possible future have kidnapped you. But it perhaps isn\u2019t the most useful response.In general, Eon attempts a great deal but doesn\u2019t always deliver. It isn\u2019t quite a political thriller, nor is it quite a scientific one. It attempts to stir up a sense of wonder, maybe even guilt, over the contrast of what humanity achieves in the Stone versus what the Death brings to Earth. But with so many different characters, it is hard to invest in any one in particular, especially when none of them emerge as the most palatable protagonist. Overall, as a story, Eon works. But I didn\u2019t end up loving it."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5697070-joe", "userReview": "Excellent read.

He never foresaw the rise of technology and networked communications in the way that Clarke or Asimov did, and as a result there were some key descriptions that suffered.That quibble aside, this is a page turner of a book\u2026 up to a point. The prose is good, and there are plenty of cliffhangers. The air of intrigue as a mysterious hollow meteorite orbits our world is comparable with Rendezvous with Rama, and there is plenty of tension as one crisis leads to another.However, some of the concepts feel underdeveloped. On many occasions, it felt that we were going to be hit with a revelation, akin to understanding the true nature of the Monoliths (2001), only for a whimpered \u201cit\u2019s too advanced to comprehend.\u201d This was disappointing because it means that either Bear never had a fully formed idea, or doesn\u2019t credit his readership with the intellect to understand.There are some saving details, albeit granular. Computer files are transferred in \"memory blocks\" - not far off from flash drives. And \u201cslates\u201d are used to interface with computers, just like tablets now. However the political vision remains mired in the 80\u2019s, and it struggles for it.Perhaps the biggest problem is that this book touches (but does not fully explore) the idea of an infinite number of universes, and therefore an infinite number of \u201cyou\u2019s\u201d. Whilst ok in principle, it renders the actions of the characters pointless. Their victory or failure is utterly devoid of meaning, and resulted in me disengaging about two-thirds of the way through.In short, lots of good ideas that are never fully realized. Whilst it makes for compulsive reading, there is ultimately little pay off.Read once."}, {"userName": "Arnis", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6257859-arnis", "userReview": "https://poseidons99.wordpress.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Redfox5", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3816075-redfox5", "userReview": "I recently read 'Ringworld' another object in space story.

It certainly is full of some very good sci-fi ideas. Hard Sci-Fi for sure. I like the idea of the infinately long linear universe, 'The Way', created by man kind's future descendents. Within this 'corridor' universe, humanity has evolved into several different kinds of entity; some humanoid, some completey abstract and exist as recorded memories. A whole new social structure exists, strange and complex.The book deals with how our current mankind deals with his future, and his tragic past. The tragedy at the start of the book is of the worst order. The future is uncertain.The technology throughout the book is beyond understandable science, but within the acceptable level of imagination. My problem with the book is that Greg Bear has not created any characters whom I feel any affinity to. None of the characters have much depth beyond what is required to allow the plot. It is with some sadness that I can say that after reading this, I couldn't care what happened to any of them!The universe is described in a purely scientific method. I understand the size of everything in metres; I can visualize the shape of everything in terms of poygons, discs, spheres etc.. But I did not feel any atmospheric description of any of the locations. All a bit cold and sterile.The book took a while to get through because I just could not stay hooked long enough. The book left me a little underwhelmed.Although...

But once you get past all that\u2026In spite of its weaknesses, Eon will always be one of my favorite books because it contains so many amazing ideas. The Way is one of the greatest and most under-utilized creations in all of Science Fiction in my opinion. I challenge anyone to name anything of equal scope, innovation, and elegance anywhere in Science Fiction.  While asteroid starships are not uncommon, few are as beautifully conceived and realized as the Thistledown, with its haunting, abandoned cities, forests, and libraries of books from other realities -- it's a character itself. The scene in which the Thistledown library personality discusses brain- and personality-repair options with a character who has been shot in the head is chilling and touching. But what I love most about Eon, and most of Greg Bear's work, is that it is about HUMAN achievements, and the dreams and flaws that can drive individuals and civilizations both to greatness and destruction. The wonders of Eon are not the technologies of some wise and powerful aliens, nor the works of some inscrutable \"forerunners\" or \"ancients\" or whatever. Humans rose up out of the ashes of their apocalypse, roped an asteroid, filled it with cities, and sent it to the stars. Humans mastered genetics, psychology, information, and space-time, created a universe, and travelled beyond the end of time."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/919422-mark", "userReview": "Rather compelling remake of Clarke's Rendesvouz with Rama. It really needed to be three books, perhaps, as too much happened in the last third of the book, and a bit too quickly to really engage me. Theoretical time/space science becomes the magic pixie dust that makes everything possible in the last portion of this book, but I still enjoyed it, even what I had a hard time visualizing.Why aren't hard science fiction writers allowed to use illustrations?

But the Stone is not an alien structure. It comes from the past/future of our humanity. Tombstone or milestone, the war that breaks out on the earth beneath its presence seems to bear witness to its prowess as oracle\u2026Blurb to the 1987 Legend edition.Although \u2018Blood Music\u2019 received more attention from the SF community , this is probably the book in which Bear set the standard for his subsequent work. It\u2019s Hard SF/Big Science at its hardest, and in one sense can be seen as a \u2018Rendezvous with Rama\u2019 for the Nineteen Eighties. Bear should also be applauded for his portrayal of female characters as in this and subsequent novels he places strong female characters centre-stage, in this case, Patricia Luis Vasquez, a young gifted physics student who is drafted in to solve the mysteries of the Stone and becomes important to the plans of all the factions involved. The plot involves some complex physics and the concept of parallel universes. In the year 2000 an asteroid is detected as it heads toward Earth. Not only has it been excavated and modified, but is an exact duplicate of the asteroid Juno. Its interior is a functioning habitat divided over seven chambers through the middle of which runs a bright plasma beam. The seventh chamber appears to go on into infinity. It is always interesting to look at authors\u2019 views of the future once that future is past and gone. Written in 1985, Bear\u2019s future world has become a kind of \u2018alternate future\u2019 since perhaps no-one could have predicted that the abrupt fall of the USSR and the smashing down of the Berlin wall. Here, the USSR is still a superpower, and the Cold War very much alive. Bear cleverly sets up the East/West ideological divides while Nuclear War destroys the Earth in the background, before bringing in the people of Earth\u2019s future. They live in Axis City, a vast mobile habitat which roams \u2018The Way\u2019 (the corridor which stretches along the infinity of parallel Universes) and which is itself divided along ideological lines between radical Geshels and orthodox Naderites.The Naderites (who take their name from Ralph Nader, a real-life American campaigner and activist on social issues, who, from what I can gather, espouses Green Policies) embody the ideals of a combination of Green policies and advocate a rejection of over-reliance on technology (despite the extremely hi-tech lifestyle they enjoy) specifically rejecting the tendency of the Geshels to redesign their own bodies into fantastic forms.The asteroid has arrived from a future parallel universe, but one which also suffered the same nuclear exchange as ours. The arrival of humans from our earth on \u2018Thistledown\u2019 as the Axis dwellers call it, precipitates a political crisis within the city in which divisions polarise."}, {"userName": "Luke Joseph", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16575923-luke-joseph", "userReview": "[cold war era holocaust survivors living after doomsday in an environment governed by an AI with no knowledge of any of that, (hide spoiler)]"}], "description": "The 21st century was on the brink of nuclear confrontation when the 300 kilometer-long stone flashed out of nothingness and into Earth's orbit.
