Now imagine my utter disappointment as page after page of mediocre cliches assaulted my eyes. Set in the very real world of the Middle Ages, it toys with pagan beliefs and the intersection with Christianity... showing some promise. But the vampires just suck the life out of it. I mean, come on, how friggin' \"new and exciting\" is it for the victim to enjoy being fed on? Or for there to be erotic overtones to everything about being a vampire?The big addition: a slightly new origin for the vampire race and the role of the Priest of Blood. Of course, that gets all sorts of psuedo-mythological mumbo-jumbo going, another pitfall.Still not worth it to me, but I allow for my complete disappointment in what I had expected versus reality and I say the book was \"OK.\"I won't be reading the sequel."}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "Sometimes you CAN judge a book by it's cover."}, {"userName": "Angela Sasser", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1950123-angela-sasser", "userReview": "I found this book at a library sale and expected the quality of a cast-off secondhand, having never heard of Clegg's work. Imagine my surprise when I started reading and found it to be a real page turner! Every page made me wonder \"Just what on earth could happen next to this poor guy?\" The suspense of an uncertain future with a hard luck character and his descent into vampirism are far less romantic and cliche than the back summary would have you believe. This book is dark, gritty, and far more down to earth than I expected with fairly believable characters and some interesting plot twists. It's very different from other vampires books I've read with its touch of Celtic mysticism and period medieval atmosphere that make it a unique setting, though I believe Clegg could have pushed the atmosphere even more by researching and showing more specific battles of the time. Still, as a servant for the main character, it makes sense that they would not be too involved in the politics rather than the rough and tumble bloodshed of war.As for the vampirism in this novel, it's not so much erotic as it is animalistic, a pleasant change from stereotypical dark vampire behavior. There is a level of eroticism to this book, but nowhere near the level of something more purposefully erotic like the Kushiel series. The vampires in this universe seem much more a part of the natural world with their pack mentality and distinct change from human to animalistic thinking. This characterization seems inconsistent at times, but I trust Clegg will explain such things in the later additions to this series.Despite some rather awkward moments of digression in the narrative and strange metaphors alluding to barbed cat phalli, I found this book to be highly entertaining and will be looking up the rest in the series."}, {"userName": "Geoff", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5332297-geoff", "userReview": "This is the first book in a trilogy called \u201cThe Vampyricon\u201d. It is the growing up of a boy, and his eventual lead into being a vampyre. Clegg changes a few things about a vampyre, and makes them his own, which adds to the story, as it's not all clich\u00e9 vampyre stuff. It is set in a mythical dark ages period, an draws on a chapter from The Crusades, but even that history is warped. Clegg even explained that he didn't want the story to be verbatim, but more or less his world, than factual. And what Clegg tried to do, he succeeded at, and then some.This is new territory for Clegg. Even though it is a horror novel, it is more a fantasy story. Clegg has jumped into the fantasy setting with ease, without losing any of his horror fans. This is a solid book by Clegg that was a very interesting read, and not your typical vampyre story.."}, {"userName": "Jestice Love", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35819967-jestice-love", "userReview": "[ \u201cWhen Medhya arose And found her skin torn Her children wept and gathered their own flesh To offer their mother So that she might hide her shame, And when they took her blood Which held the power of eternal life, Her children wept and set their hearts On the underworld where the blood of the Earth flowed That their mother might find sustenance.

I found The Priest of Blood to be a muddled mess that takes too long to get anywhere, hardly does anything, and does not leave me wanting more. It really felt like parts of three or four underdeveloped novels slapped together with a prologue that somehow made things more confusing instead of tying it all together, as well as robbing the narrative of immediacy. Though fairly original, the vampyre mythology was confusing and hard to follow. The settings were often rich but I couldn't connect any of the characters. Pacing seemed to be the second biggest problem. Sometimes the writing felt suitably atmospheric, but most of the time I was left scratching my head why so much fluff was left on the page that couldn't have been summarized in favor of some action."}, {"userName": "Joel Lindenberg", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77460881-joel-lindenberg", "userReview": "Good not greatThis book was actually super interesting until the main character became a vampire! Probably a personal preference but I really enjoyed the story of the midieval village and the witches in the forest much more than the vampire mythos. If you're a big vampire fan this is a fun and somewhat original take on the vampire origin story. Bloody at times but certainly not scary. I felt like a lot of the most interesting characters and plot dynamics were lost once Aleric left his village but perhaps they'll be revisited in the sequels.

In that regard, The Priest of Blood worked well for me as a reader. Turned by the vampyre Pythia, while involved in the Crusades, Falconer recalls his life growing up as the bastard offspring of the village whore.Much of the book tells of his early years in Brittany, and of the boy\u2019s need to prove his worth considering his humble beginnings. We learn that Falconer has a gift for working with birds and eventually is employed by the local baron.But life for Falconer is a trial. He never quite fits in, and an ill-starred passion for a woman far beyond his station results in his being sent to fight in the Holy Land, where he ultimately meets his doom.Yet among the damned, it appears that Falconer is exalted \u2013 a chosen one and their Priest of Blood, with all that the role entails. He and his companions embark on a journey to their source in order to gain a better understanding of their kind and to find a solution to eradicate a frailty in their bloodline. As for what they find once they discover their goal \u2013 their actions will have far-reaching ramifications. And that\u2019s pretty much what book one is about, since it functions as a prologue for what I assume to be more to follow. Essentially, if you\u2019re waiting for things to get off the ground, you\u2019ll be in for a disappointment.That being said, what I did enjoy was the last part of the story, when the companions really get going in their explorations. the many wonders they discover are fascinating, if not bizarre \u2013 and certainly off quite a nice diversion from the usual vampire origin stories. I kept thinking this was Indiana Jones meets The Queen of the Damned.Clegg weaves a tale on epic proportions, with much depth, though at times I felt I wanted a little more input with regard to the environment \u2013 to put it bluntly, a little more \u201cshow\u201d to counterbalance his telling. I can\u2019t fault the latter. He does it well, though at times I also feel to detriment of characterisation. I wanted a little more in that department too.My verdict: this story is wordy and sometimes ponderous, but if you\u2019re a huge fan of vampires, and are a patient reader who has enjoyed Anne Rice, then this may appeal to you."}, {"userName": "Madelon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100187-madelon", "userReview": "First I must apologize to my friend Doug Clegg for having taken so long to finish this excellent tale.

In fact, there was a time when my goal was to read every vampire story and novel in existence. That goal became impractical when every romance writer hopped on the vampire as trope bandwagon. Most of them should have stuck with the tried and true bodice ripping lords and pirates.THE PRIEST OF BLOOD has a somewhat Arthurian feel with its deep forest and old gods.
