What kind of dilemmas would this cause society? For example, if this actually happened in Stockholm, I\u2019m sure that that the publishers of Stieg Larsson\u2019s books would chain his zombified ass to a desk and let him bang on the keys of a laptop until they got enough to put out a new bestseller, The Girl Who sJFnfJGgJOJ=I30&*(&U389kkl8.Back to this book. Sweden is experiencing a weird electrical surge that leaves people unable to turn off or unplug their electronics, and it also seems to be giving everyone some wicked headaches. After a sudden intensification of the electrical field, it\u2019s gone but in it\u2019s wake, the recently dead in the area have awakened.However, these aren\u2019t the usual flesh eating zombies. These are just mindless and disgusting corpses that usually try to return to their old homes. The Swedish government tries to deal with 2000 of the walking dead as their loved ones demand answers and access to them. Is this a virus? Something supernatural? A sign of the apocalypse? No one knows, and the status of the zombies\u2019 civil rights is up in the air since no law has ever addressed the undead before. As tensions rise, it becomes clear that the zombies are causing some kind of telepathy in the living people as well as becoming mirrors to the emotional state of those closest to them.As both a fan of the zombie genre and Lindquvist\u2019s previous genre-bending vampire novel Let the Right One In, I had high hopes for this one, but I was supremely disappointed. Part of my problem with this has to do with my own preferences in zombie story telling. I like my zombies to be horrific cannibals who munch brains and destroy society while survivors struggle against them and each other. Whenever anyone starts to add in telepathy or tries to make the zombies part of some larger supernatural force, my eyes glaze over. And if you\u2019ve got a pack of zombies that are just sad remnants of the people who died that don\u2019t even try to gnaw on the nearest person, then I\u2019m just not that interested. (Yes, I realize I have issues.)It seems like Lindquvist couldn\u2019t decide if he was writing a horror novel about the nature of death, or kind of an absurd take on the idea of how society would react if people did come back from the dead. Frankly, S.G. Browne\u2019s black comedy Breathers already dealt with a lot of these ideas, and Browne did it better. The focus keeps wandering as Lindqvist tries to add in some horror elements late in the game, and the ending was a mess.It\u2019s still well-written and Lindquvist is a writer who realizes that people are the ultimate monsters, but I would have liked to have seen what kind of twist he could have put on the classic zombie genre of the undead destroying society rather than society trying to figure out how to deal with some mostly harmless walking corpses."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Exceptional, morbid, & even quite beautiful. This one forms a trifecta with two other grand titans of modern horror lit I've read of late, \"The Troop\" by Nick Cutter and \"The Girl Next Door\" by Jack Ketchum. Alright, alright, I was also mightily impressed by the military-novel-slash-zombie-epic \"World War Z\"... so that's quite a few there! For a snobby reader, I sure am blessed.The eeriness in this one raises hairs & activates them good ol' goosebumps. The relationships being tested as the natural boundaries of human existence is displaced for good makes the book unique and it is written in good taste, with fascinating stories that seem true--that the general existence of zombies is finally acknowledged in a book about the rising dead, that they exist in the same dimension, that they aren't a completely foreign concept by the residents handling the undead--this is uncommon and hardly ever done. This is gratifyingly un-gratuitous... a true triumph of the genre.

Sure, I only read about half the novel. I don't care. I feel like I can make the call. Why, you ask?I picked up this book off the \u201cnew fiction\u201d library shelf when a woman was checking out about 14,000 DVDs and I didn't want to stand behind her and wait. Last year I read and loved Let the Right One In, for which this is author is best known, and I was hoping Handling the Undead was just as moving and innovative except with zombies rather than vampires.The last sentence of the previous paragrah contains an unfair expectation. Zombies are, you know, zombies. They sort of go \u201cuuuhhhhh\u201d and walk around slow (Unless you're in that scary as shit zombie movie, the one with Sarah Polley, which I can only watch five minutes at a time when I channel surf basic cable. Those zombies were fast.) but have no emotional weight. They can't talk. Well, in this case, at least one of them kind of talks, but...well, barely.I could be wrong, but I get the feeling I knew where Lindqvist was headed with the storyline and wasn't that interested in the terrain. So these zombies don't kill anyone (uh, at least in the first 146 pages) and the zombies' loved ones aren't sure how to handle the newly undead. Should they sledgehammer the bodies until they're dead for sure? Lock them up and hope for a cure? Renovate the spare bedroom for zombie needs? Are the zombies even their loved ones, or just their loved ones corporeal forms reacting to freak stimuli? Linqvist, I think, is trying to explore the limits and desperation of love. Ok. I get that. And he adds fascinating new elements (e.g. the initial event when all appliances turn on and are impossible to shut down) to the genre. He also seems to relish twisting the reader's intestines by placing characters in realistic and heartbreaking situations. His characters sound authentic. But...Let the Right One In transcended horror novel conventions and Handling the Dead did not. And I wanted more. Maybe that's not fair. Maybe I'm like everyone who bought Around the World in a Day hoping the album sounded like the Purple Rain soundtrack. I'm ok with that. Do I think exploring the limits and desperation of love in relation to encountering, for example, one's wife as a zombie, is interesting? Yes. 146 pages worth of interesting, in this case, but not more. I wanted this novel to end by page 100. And that's no way to read. Two stars, for the first half, a pass on the second."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Another Swedish gift to the world \u2013 after lutfisk, Ikea, Abba and the girl with the tattoo on her arse, now we get nice zombies. Well, these ones are not that nice, I guess. They don\u2019t want to eat you, so that\u2019s a plus, but they have limited conversation and really their concept of personal hygiene leaves something to be desired. But like Paul Simon said they\u2019re all right in a sort of limited way for an off-night. In fact I was behind these zombies all the way until the last quarter of the story when like a cornered Christian Mr Lindqvist starts babbling mystical abstractions in an obvious attempt to cover up the blatant fact that he did not know how to end his story.Up to then it was compelling. For a very specific period of time in a very specific place (Stockholm) dead people come back to life. But in a realistic way, not in a cosy way like in those Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses pamphletsNo \u2013 imagine your wife dies in a car crash and a week later she wakes up in the morgue \u2013 most of her face and right side is still missing and she really doesn\u2019t seem to be quite herself. What do you tell your son? All she does now is flap around vaguely. She\u2019s lost all her ambition. The situation is distressing. So we get three such scenarios and an attempted overview of how the authorities react to 2000 or so re-livers, as they\u2019re called. All of this is good, very compelling reading. I like stories where the crazy stuff is treated seriously and realistically. Just like it was in Let the Right One In, Mr Lindqvist\u2019s famous brilliant vampire novel. But as I say in this one for the last 50 pages the (living) characters start to spout mystical non-sequiturs which finally aggravated me to death and I died and came back to life and I wasn\u2019t a nice zombie and I tracked Mr Lindqvist down and ate him. You may have read about it in the papers. For me this was Goat\u2019s Head Soup after Sticky Fingers, Walking Dead season 6 after Walking Dead season 5, Joey after Friends, Roger Moore after Sean Connery, Sentimental Education after Madame Bovary\u2026.First 300 pages : 4 starsNext 60 pages : 1.5 starsRounded up to 3 stars because I like where this author is coming from even though I didn\u2019t like where he went to in this one."}, {"userName": "Mia Nauca", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33138824-mia-nauca", "userReview": "3.5 estrellasLas 3 primeras partes de este libro son incre\u00edbles, me encantaron.

This book is lifeless and barely kicking, just like the zombies it is about.Now, of course I have to give the author credit for the fresh premise. Lindqvist's zombies are not violent and are not monsters. The story is not about them going after people to chomp on their flesh. Rather, the author raises questions: if the undead are not aggressive, how will people react to them, handle them? will the relatives welcome the return of their dead beloved or be disgusted by them? how should the undead population be treated by authorities, as corpses or as human beings? what place do they have in a society? This is definitely not something often explored in zombie literature. In spite of the interesting premise, the book is just so dull and slow! There is maybe a couple of scenes of genuine horror and gore, the rest is all unrelatable, unremarkable, cardboard people going about their dull business, thinking dull thoughts. And then it's written in a very juvenile style. IDK if the translator didn't do her job properly. The best parts of the story are snippets of TV interviews, medical research, and newspaper articles. Basically, the novel lacks psychological depth, complexity, emotional impact and excitement of Let the Right One In. It is a half-baked effort, a story that never reaches its full potential. Give it a miss if you are a fan of the author's first book."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565777-christina", "userReview": "A butterfly beats its wings somewhere in the universe - and an electrical field lowers itself over Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and causes a piercing headache in everyone as well as making it impossible to turn of any electrical appliances or machines. When the field lifts, something has changed - the recently deceased have come back to life... - and they want to come home.That's the premise in John Ajvide Lindqvist's book. This wouldn't normally be a book I would read - much less buy - but after reading a review in Weekendavisen, I felt like I had to read it. And it is definitely not your typical zombie story!The book follows three families. David and his son Magnus who looses the mother of the family, Eva - who dies a few hours before the dead wake up again and therefore is very interesting to authorities, especially because she speaks. Flora and her grandmother - grandfather actually returns from the morgue. And finally - and to me and the reviewer in Weekendavisen most interesting - 6 years old Elias and his mother Anna and grandfather. Elias died a month earlier and grandfather therefore had to dig him out. This scene, with grandfather digging and Elias scratching on the lid of the coffin as well as the sound of him shaking the box of Legos he was burried with, was so strong and emotional - and the reason I had to read this book. This storyline with Elias' mother and grandfather trying to bring him back to life by giving him water with salt and sugar, using cremes to help make his skin less dry is so touching, especially if you have children of your own that you would do everything for - even after they've been dead for a month and certainly look the part and have nothing left of that cuddly chubbyness they had when you last saw them...A fourth component is the medias and authorities. Throughout the book, we are given interviews with doctors, politicians and military personel as well as parts of articles and tv-programmes (including from CNN and other medias outside Sweden) which help tell the not personal and private stories of these undeads - and put a light on the difference between what the relatives and the authorities want to see happen with these 'people'.This is a book about metaphysics (is it the soul that brought these people back - and what is a soul then? What is death? Is death no longer the end?), religion (Is this the End of Days? Is the world going under and Jesus returning?), ethics (is it okay to do just anything to the undeads since they have no rights (Citizenship ends with death)?) but mostly, it's a book about love - love for your family, and especially the love between parents and children.But it's also a book about hate and fear. See, the undeads have the ability to receive what you're thinking and their reactions are conditioned of what you feel. So if you feel hate towards them or think they are ugly, they react - in strong ways, as little Magnus discovers when he brings his new pet rabbit to visit his undead mother...So even though this is a very light and easy read, Lindqvist manages to put a lot of food for thought into it - and even though this is not my normal genre, I really enjoyed it and I think that I will read more of this author's works."}, {"userName": "Maria Clara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46308842-maria-clara", "userReview": "Segundo libro del reto La casa encantada.Exactamente no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 esperaba de este libro, pero no ha conseguido engancharme."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "I really enjoyed Lindqvist's \"Let The Right One In\". I liked the feel of it - the tone and darkness and sadness. I liked the immediate connection with the characters, that, while a little awkward at first, smoothed out and became effortless not long into the story. I liked the multi-level creepiness, and then the flat out horror. It was good. There were some issues with the writing, which could come down to translation, but were distracting nonetheless. Everything that I liked about that book is missing in this one, and everything I disliked is amplified. And on top of that, \"Handling the Undead\" is just boring. I gave up reading this around the 27% mark. I said that I was going to give this another 50 pages, but I just couldn't. Every single time I picked it up and saw whole conversations consisting of vague non-dialogue (\"Did you...?\" \"Yes.\" \"Oh, good... I thought...\" \"No.\") I just wished for a real zombie to come eat my brain and put me out of my misery. The most frightening thing that happened in the 27% of the book I read was that it made me read spoilers. Intentionally. Yup. I fucking read SPOILERS in the hopes that they would indicate some sort of book redemption. Instead, I learned that this book is just one long, poorly written, painfully boring musing on the nature of life and death, the soul, existence. FML. If I want to read a philosophy book, I'll do that. I pick up zombie books because I want to read about vicious, relentlessly hungry monsters. If not those kinds, then SOME kind of zombie that does something other than shuffle paperwork. Hey, Lindqvist?

Two stars are for John Ajvide Lindqvist's somber and ambitious attempt to try something radically different in a sub-genre where so many authors simply follow the market. It's an admirable try. Freakish atmospheric phenomenon hits Stockholm during the summer and the lives of several characters are effected when the corpses of nearly 2,000 recently deceased Swedes rise from the grave. Standup comedian David loses his wife Eva in a car accident only to watch her reanimate in Danderyd Hospital. Their 9-year-old son Magnus must cope. A reporter named Mahler is dispatched to the hospital to find the staff struggling to detain the bodies who have hopped up in the morgue and are struggling to leave. Mahler has a 6-year-old grandson who recently died and digs the boy out of his grave to bring it home to his despondent daughter Anna. What's left of the boy is more mummy than child, but rather than turn it over to the authorities, Mahler and Anna hide it. Elvy and her granddaughter Flora are gifted with second sight and are visited by Elvy's dead husband, who cannot speak, but tries to go about living as if nothing had changed. Whereas Flora is a fan of Marilyn Manson and horror movies, her Christian grandmother sees this as a sign of the Resurrection. They both detect a presence around the undead and though the corpses remain non-violent, soon to be rounded up and interned at the hospital, the women sense something else is going on.Handling the Undead was a Kindle purchase and by the time I'd read 70%, I started flipping through the pages to finish. The novel is inferior to Lindqvist's spellbinding debut in every way -- one-dimensional characters, flaccid atmosphere, sparse social commentary, lack of horror -- and nowhere near as chilling or unpredictable as his most recent.Buyer beware, this is not a doomsday take on the zombie sub-genre or one in which the dead lurch around muttering \"Brains!\" With total seriousness, Lindqvist attempts to examine how Stockholm would react if the dead returned, from media coverage to legal issues to the behavior of Christian wingnuts. The problem is that very little seems at stake. Afterlife stories are often hamstrung with grieving characters, who I find not very interesting because they remain stuck in one gear. They're beside themselves over the death of a loved one until they learn contact might be made, but mostly, they weep, and mope, and ache, and they do this for family members the reader has no investment in and doesn't care a fig about. Handling the Undead never overcomes this drag. Lindqvist does conjure two ghoulish scenes involving the reanimated. One involves a grisly accident victim staring at her husband with her one remaining eye, and the second involving a drowning victim with little remaining in the way of human features trying to break into a cabin on an island. *** Spoilers! ***The author reveals that the undead are surrounded by an energy field which not only enables the living to read each others thoughts, but to influence the dead with their own thoughts. This is sort of like the \"mood slime\" in Ghostbusters II. This psychic concept was something new and had potential, but by then, I was bored by the characters and not interested in finding out what it meant for them."}, {"userName": "Annie\u2661", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63796779-annie", "userReview": "[Bien, en este caso no termin\u00f3 de convencerme la historia, puede que sea interesante la forma en que trata el tema de la Muerte y todo eso, pero hubo algo que no acab\u00f3 de convencerme.

So much happens once the \u2018reliving\u2019 return, the government find themselves making the wrong decisions, how do you handle people who are technically alive but not alive, do they have rights? Do they have a place in the world? Can they return to their families?\u2018Handling the Undead\u2019 is more than a story about life after death, what do you do when you lose someone and they come back from the dead? All the characters in the story are conflicted, they have lost someone in some way and now they have returned but the \u2018reliving\u2019 are different, they are not the people they once were, they are a shell of what they were but at the same time there is a faint glimmer of the person they were. All of the relationships are strong relationships, you can feel the strength as you read, and you feel their pain and their loss, their confusion, coming to terms with a loss and then their happiness when their loved ones return. I found \u2018Handling the Undead\u2019 to be a powerful read, so many questions are raised and so many social problems are brought forward, you will get very engrossed in this story, there is so much to this book that you will find enjoyable, enlightening, scary and most of all make you look at the world around you.A must read."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "Preface to review - I'm not a zombie fan.

I am okay with, and in this case even expected, a different take on a classic horror theme, but... this just did not do it for me. I felt like there was so much promise in the premise, so many possible directions to go in, and a building-up which never crescendo-ed, but merely dropped away in surprisingly undramatic fashion. So, yeah the story didn't really work, but I am pretty sure it could have if the correct structure and style had been adopted, it was a mismatch. To me the story could have largely followed the same themes of dealing with death and loss, but in that case needed more emotionally driven writing, something less journalistic and distant - it did not hit the right cords. I didn't end up caring for the characters, I felt for their general pain, but that was because of an empathy I have for such loss, not because I was convinced that the characters actually felt it. The book was a little too flat and/or discordant, relying on the reader to inject the emotion themselves. There were scenes that felt genuinely creepy, but then they took away from the other themes that were developed and the creepy factor was not committed to either leaving the reader in an awkward middle ground, believing none of it.

Readers who are looking for more of the same will be disappointed, but not because this novel is somehow inferior or less ambitious than the first. They will be disappointed because they are trying to read his first novel again. They will not be interested in what Lindqvist is writing now, and they will be missing out on a fascinating book as a result.This is a more expansive story than Lindqvist's previous novel with more focus on more characters, but (to my surprise) it was a more powerful, more personal and more emotionally resonant book as well. Like the protagonist in \"Let The Right One In\", I was raised in a single-parent home, I was bullied, and I had a friend at that age who believed himself to be a vampire; I too entertained vicious revenge-fantasies and struggled to understand the state of my young life. Yet for the most part all i felt while reading that novel was a general revulsion -- at the characters, the events, the places. That was absolutely not the case with \"Handling The Undead\" however. This book begins by focusing on three groups of people, each dealing (or about to deal) with the death of a loved one, and these were more real, more emotionally honest, than anything I encountered in \"Let The Right One In\". These are two very different novels. \"Let The Right One In\" is a more traditional horror story, a vampire story, and a story about life in 1980s Sweden; \"Handling The Undead\" is a novel about humanity and its relationship to death, about our different reactions to loss and to the unexpected, set in an alternate version of our recent past (alternate only because of the events described in this novel). This book has a broader scope and is more about reactions than about the horror itself. The nature of the Re-living is never quite explained; there are hints and suggestions and attempts, but it is never as clear, never as explicitly articulated as is the nature of the vampires in \"Let The Right One In\". Death is the Great Unknown and so even where explicit features are given in \"Handling The Undead\", they are little more than tantalizing clues to a riddle which is never really solved. To some this will be frustrating; to others it will be brilliant; the rest will simply shrug and say \"Well, yes, that's European novels for you.\" I reacted in all three ways. And i loved it."}, {"userName": "F.R.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1309606-f-r", "userReview": "The first two-thirds of \u2018Handling the Undead\u2019 are brilliant. Rather than go the traditional Romero route with his zombie story, Lindqvist tries to present the tale almost within real life parameters.After a heat-wave and a surge of electricity, the recently deceased of Sweden start to rise. There is chaos, particularly at the hospitals, and the apparatus of state is forced to move in quickly (and clumsily) to sort out the mess. But these zombies are not flesh-eating, brain-craving monsters. They do not walk with their arms out-stretched in graveyards or dance to Michael Jackson songs. Instead they are rotting bodies suddenly \u2013 and seemingly harmlessly \u2013 returned to life, and those who can communicate have no more idea why than anybody else. Clearly dead people walking around is a disturbing phenomena and the experts work hard to understand it. The wider public is initially fascinated, but then goes back to normal life with picnics and comedy clubs and so on. And these details of scientific analysis, coupled with the real world managing to survive (as well as various inserts showing Prime Ministerial press conferences, official reaction and television news reports), all add an air of authenticity to what is obviously a fantastical scenario.At the emotional centre of the book are three families who have each been recently bereaved, and now are having to cope with the unexpected return of their loved ones. These tales don\u2019t overlap as much as I would have liked, and it can seem like reading three separate short stories that have been knit together \u2013 but Lindqvist does have a good feel for his characters, and it\u2019s hard not to empathise with their plight and their responses.Where the novel fails though is in its final third. Having created this wonderful set-up in a real-life world, then built up superb characters in an incredible situation, it seems as if Lindqvist has no idea what to do next. This is a definitely a book which finishes with a whimper rather than a bang, limping its way to a close when one expected so much more of it."}, {"userName": "DeAnna Knippling", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3166570-deanna-knippling", "userReview": "A strange, hard-to-describe book.It started slowly; it has multiple POVs (which I normally am less than enthusiastic about); it's not about zombies (vs. the undead) until the very end of the book; I wasn't quite sure what the book was about, although it was definitely about something; it should have felt like a pretentious literary interpretation of a pop subject but didn't.Suddenly, for no reason, there's a heat wave in Sweden, electrical appliances don't work the way they should, and the newly dead start coming back. Is the reason religious or scientific? This is carefully balanced and left in mystery (although both religion and science [and goths] are skewered, not outright, but in retrospect. \"Ahhhh...that's what that meant\" kind of thing).The living, when around the dead, start becoming telepathic. The dead, when around the living, start absorbing their emotions, which are mostly negative. Bad things happen due to both.This This wasn't a book about zombies, it was a book about death. I know, zombies are supposed to be about death, but they really aren't. They're about death-as-a-threat-you-can-fight-but-ultimately-overwhelms-you. This is a book about how-we-feel-about-our-dead. Our loved ones, are they threats, now that they're dead? Do we ever resolve what we feel about them? Do they stop being people in our hearts, even though they're not themselves? Does death terrify us because it is scary, or because we are scared of it?I liked it.

Consider what it is and is, instead of what it isn't and isn't meant to be. I think I heard that on \"Top Chef,\" which seems a little think-y for reality TV. In the case of Lindqvist's follow up to the re-imagined vampire business \"Let the Right One In,\" I was so impatient waiting for these drooling, limb-lugging corpses to start a revolution that I almost missed out on the actual story, which is just a tad bit endearing. Stockholm, 2002, and in some sort of freak-of-nature glitch, the bodies of people who have died in the last 2 months come back to life. Well, life-ish. They can't really talk, and some have severed faces and extremities, but they have clawed their way out of graves and walked out of morgues.The most bizarre case belongs to David, a comedian whose wife died minutes before this un-deading. She sits up in her hospital bed, half her face missing and the medical clamps affixed to her innards are all a'jangle. She is so freshly dead that she still has the ability to mimic language, despite mostly being a shell of a human. Mahler is a grizzly old retired newspaperman who gets the scoop on the story from one of his old connects at the hospital. He heads to the morgue for a first-person account of this unbelievable phenomenon, then jets off to the cemetery to dig up his grandson Elias. Elvy, an elderly religious sort with strong telepathic powers, is a little put off when her husband shows up and resumes his place at his desk, rifling through paperwork. She and her granddaughter Flora -- who is similarly telepathized -- have him removed and sent off to live with the others who have been collected by ambulances throughout the day. Elvy wants nothing to do with her late husband, and reminds herself that she said \"Til death do us part,\" and technically, he is dead.The novel follows these characters as they respond to the scenario in which a loved one for whom they were still grieving comes back, rotted to back-of-the-refrigerator and lunch-bag-left-in-car levels, filled with gases, lacking even the most basic human abilities. For David, it means lying to himself and his young son. Preparing for his wife to be well enough to return home. For Mahler, it means hiding Elias from the government sanctioned holding cell for the \"re-living,\" as they have been coined by the politically correct spokespeople. He bathes the child, moisturizes the hell out of him, and invents a salt water concoction for Elias to drink. Elvy gathers her peers and prepares for the end times, gets a little Jehovah's Witness with her neighbors. Flora, a retired cutter in a Marilyn Manson T-shirt who kicks it old school with a walkman, wanders around wondering what it all means and hangs with her boyfriend, a squatter who pisses into a bucket.I shouldn't have been surprised that these weren't kill-kill-kill BRAINS! zombies, considering the way Lundqvist whipped up a version of vampire that can easily adapt to either the \"he\" or \"she\" pronoun. A little sweetheart whose perverted keeper does the killing for him/her. A never-aging and oft-naked little bugger who captures the heart of an awkward and unliked neighbor boy in his previous novel-turned-movie.Don't get me wrong: There are still some zombie clashes. But they are not the crux of the story. These main characters and their decisions, and the government's assistance in an unprecedented situation are the crux of the story. Sometimes it could stand for a gory backlash. But sometimes it is, oddly enough, a sweet little story."}, {"userName": "Daniel Russell", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2719530-daniel-russell", "userReview": "Let\u2019s see if the beginning of this review can sound just like every other\u2026John Ajvide Lindqvist is the shooting star of the Swedish horror literature scene, after his vampire novel, Let the Right One In, caught attention after a rather touching, intelligent and brutal film adaption. This turned many readers to the book, this reviewer included, and it was my selected read of 2010. In an industry saturated with mundane vampire novels, Lindqvist did wonders, creating a bleak and depressing book that transcended comparisons in the genre and created a book I would certainly see as a classic. Could this success be repeated with Handling the Undead? Can he do the same breathtaking job with one tired genre as he did with vampires?Handling the Undead concentrates on an area of Sweden stuck in a heatwave. One day, as the heat is at its highest and people are really suffering from its effects, electrical appliances won\u2019t turn off, and the residents are blasted by a sudden headache. Then\u2026all is quiet.But is it? The recently dead are coming back to life. Not quite the shambling, hungry armies of the undead in popular film and literature these \u2018reliving\u2019 are rotten shadows of their former selves: slow, confused and a burden to those around them.We follow three families in their struggle to deal with the recent changes: a journalist whose 8 year old son died a month ago, a goth girl and her grandmother, both psychic, and a stand up comedian whose wife was killed and reborn in the same night.And that\u2019s my problem with this book. You see, nothing else really happens.When I read a story, I like\u2026a story. Undead had a brilliant opener that kept the pages turning, but once the dead were back to life and the situation had settled down, this became more like a documentary following what these people do about it. The psychic girl and grandmother are particularly annoying. Their psychic powers have very little impact and use in the book, and when the dead grandfather arrives, they hardly seem to care at all. In fact, he never reappears and is barely even thought about. The two women just seem to go around complaining about everything.Yes, this book is 360ish pages of characters moping around, complaining and crying on each other. Yes, this might be a more realistic slant, but it makes for a very dull novel. There is no purpose, no mission, no drive through the pages. Every character seems very unsure of what to make of the event and what to do next. The idea of souls is interesting, but comes in for the last 20 or so pages from the book. This is not enough to save the book\u2019s atrocious ending.In fact, I\u2019m going to cut this review short. I started this a week ago, but like the novel itself, I had no real passion to finish it, other than a sense of obligation.The two stars I\u2019m awarding this novel is solely for the opening (even though the heat, headaches and electrical appliance thing do nothing for the story and could have easily been cut) and for a single heartbreaking chapter in the book. If this chapter was a short story, it would be incredible. Shame about the fluff that surrounds it.I can recommend this if you\u2019re a zombie enthusiast looking for something different in a very trite genre. I would also recommend this to people who like dull books.

But, if you think this is a zombie story you are correct, but not the kind of zombies you are used. This zombies do not feed on people but are just there. Some things start happening, like people getting tired around them, or able to talk to one another in their minds and even reading their emotions.But, afterwards, as the story progress we see them in a different light. They are not that different from us and they are confused. We get to see humankind, as they are. We are the beasts. I think the author tried to mask this novel as a way we see Death. We got several main characters and each had it's own experience and ideas. We get to see people who were afraid, angered or even turned religous. We even got to see how the politics, physicians and news work this out.In the end, I was not satisfied because it was a bit far-fetched. Open ending but some questions were never answered which at some way made sense because, what is Death? Nobody knows and everybody got their own view.

I started reading this book knowing that it was about zombies but had no idea what the story would be like. This is a far cry from your average zombie story and there is very little violence or gore, the zombies here are mostly docile.Basically the book deals with the basic question \"what if\". What if the dead did come back? And more to the point, what if the recently dead came back, how would their loved one's feel? What if they seemed somewhat sentient? What then?This book was heart breaking at times and achingly poignant at others. It was also very disturbing in that you find yourself thinking of loved one's you have lost and asking yourself that same question.....what if?Aside from that the story was well told and as always I liked getting a glimpse of a culture I am not overly familiar with.

Let's say a subpar zombie Virginia Woolf was dug up and resurrected and tasked to write this book in exchange for brains. Maybe then. So basically this isn't horror at all. Spooky cover, Stephen King reference on the cover, are all very misleading.So fine, it's not horror, it's some existentialist elegy to death and loss, okay. I just didn't think that was very good either. I didn't even dislike the characters, because that would be evoking strong emotions and I found this book incredibly BLAH.

Nothing at all like your trad zombie book - with only about 300 words of an exception. This book is more of a quietly sinister thriller, than a horror read. For those who are bizarro fans, you may find the premise very similar to a great little French z-horror called THEY CAME BACK - suddenly, without warning, recently deceased citizens of Stockholm, Sweden somehow come back to life.Ultimately, all the things I associate with good horror are in this book; it's defiantly character-driven, chilling, uncomfortable to read and, in its purest form, appallingly tragic.But it's not all good, of course. With the translation from Swedish to English, I feel much of the dialogue is left flat and underwhelming. Other narrative seems clumsy, over-simplistic. It's also very, very depressing.Despite these criticisms, I still read through HTU very quickly, indeed.
