This is the broad sweep kind. If you have read EJH's novels, particularly the Cazalet Chronicles which she is best known for, much of the material of her early family life and first marriage to Peter Scott will seem familiar. If you have read Slipstream, EJH's own memoir, you will recognise the fascinating (to some) - and just prurient to others - parade of her rather extraordinary love life. (Her third husband was writer Kingsley Amis, and her lovers included Poet Laureate Cecil Day-Lewis, Laurie Lee, Arthur Koestler, Kenneth Tynan and many others - including her own brother-in-law.) What Cooper brings 'new' or fresh to the biographical record is a more detailed analysis of the writer's work - and some attempted insight into the many contradictory aspects of EJH's character. I haven't read Slipstream in quite few a years, but although she does attempt self-analysis, she is also quite hard on herself. That I do recall. After her divorce to Amis, EJH spent a lot of time and energy having therapy and being involved with the kind of women's consciousness raising groups which were very popular during the 1970s. Cooper gives more detail about this therapeutic work, and how it helped EJH - or didn't help her, in the end. I do remember that EJH commented, ruefully, that she was the sort of person who had to make the same mistake over and over again before she could learn anything from it. Despite a long and complicated history with men who disappointed her, her personal assistant in later years claims that she \"couldn't shake off her romantic nature; never gave up hope that she might yet find Mr Darcy.\"One of the most interesting insights in the biography comes from American therapist Jenner Roth who worked with EJH for many years. She says that \"to receive love, you have to have something to put it in,\" and she then goes into some detail about a metaphor of a bowl. Because of EJH's childhood, and the rejection and coldness she felt from her mother, Jenner believed that EJH was like a cracked bowl - and that no amount of praise, warmth or kindness could fill it up, because it all just leaked away. Throughout the book, friends, family and colleagues refer to her formidable personality, and her tremendous work ethic, and her belief in her rightness, but then this contradictory emotional neediness which caused her to behave really quite abjectly with men. Another insight that I found very useful came from Martin Amis, her stepson. He noted that EJH had a tremendous 'imaginative sympathy' and 'penetrating sanity' when it came to the characters in her novels, but that she wasn't all that 'clever' about people in real life. I was reading The Beautiful Visit, EJH's first novel, as I read this biography - and what really struck me were the parallels between the protagonist in the novel and EJH herself. And yet the unnamed narrator in the novel, who drifts aimlessly and unhappily through much of the novel, is very much unlike EJH - who really fought for herself, demanding that she be allowed to be an actress in the early war years, despite much family opposition. Until very recently, a middle-class girl in England was raised to have no ambition for herself beyond making a good marriage. Despite everything in her life and social background - including feeling that she needed a man to complete her - EJH had this tremendous ambition to do and be something. She never seemed to make much of her own work ethic and talents, but that is what shines through - so clearly - between the cracks of her messy and storied personal life. There are many areas in which Cooper could have gone into much more detail - particularly in EJH's early life and the strained relationship she had with her only daughter Nicola - but I do think she gives a sensitive and insightful look into the psyche and literary accomplishments of this underrated 20th century writer."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "From BBC Radio 4 - Book of the Week:Elizabeth Jane Howard wrote brilliant novels about what love can do to people, but in her own life the lasting relationship she sought so ardently always eluded her.

I was impressed. And having read stuff by both Martin and Kingsley Amis I decided it was only fair to give her novels a go too. I read the Cazalet Chronicles as they were all I could really find, but I burned through them - which is to say, I enjoyed them a great deal. They were so very different to Kingsley Amis's work that the idea of these two writers being married to each other became fascinating to me, I wondered if it might be a similar vibe to Harold Pinter and Antonia Fraser (who I am obsessed with as a couple). Spoiler - it wasn't. I only found that out from reading this book. I knew that Howard and Amis didn't stay together but all I really knew about Jane (she is always Jane and never Elizabeth) was that she was considered impossibly beautiful and glamorous in her youth, especially for a writer. But that was enough for me to put this book on my want list as soon as it came out. When I first started reading this I became immediately unnerved by its familiarity. Her family history, her early life - the handsome, dashing father and ex-ballerina mother. The holidays to the big family home in the country with her grandparents...it was literally The Light Years (first volume of Cazalet Chronicles). Jane's life up until the age of about 30 perfectly mirrors that of Louise Cazalet, and though it was interesting to find out about the real life counterparts of characters I had enjoyed, it took me a little while to keep the two (the novels and the biography) separate in my head (and they each totally deserve their own bit of space in there!). Where it really got super interesting for me was when Jane's writing career took flight - as a writer, I loved learning about how she went about putting her novels together, and how she got the ideas - how much of herself she put into the books. The life of a gorgeous female novelist in mid-20th century London was just so much more interesting than anything you read about now. Jane's colourful love life adds a lot to her biography - I'm sure the poor woman would have been a lot happier if she had found the true and sustaining love she so desperately craved but honestly, reading about a long stable marriage would probably have been a lot less interesting than finding out about her escapades with a succession of (sometimes famous) Mr Wrongs. I'd say the tone of the prose has a sort of affectionate detachment - if that makes any sense - in which you could tell that the writer, Artemis Cooper, clearly admired Jane a great deal, but didn't shy away from highlighting the bad stuff - the affairs, the betrayals, the less palatable parts of her personality (she could be needy, demanding and affected). I was not surprised to find out towards the end, that Cooper knew Jane a little through her family, but wasn't part of her inner circle. Mostly though, this book paints a picture of a kind and generous and wildly talented woman who just wanted everything to be perfect for everyone around her. All I kept thinking as I read it, from start to finish, was 'what a life she led.'"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4499021-sharon", "userReview": "Review to come"}, {"userName": "La Stamberga dei Lettori", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5361973-la-stamberga-dei-lettori", "userReview": "Leggendo la saga dei Cazalet mi sono spesso interrogata sulla visione critica e, per la maggior parte, negativa offerta da Elizabeth Jane Howard sul matrimonio.Ora che ho letto il coinvolgente riassunto che Artemis Cooper offre della vita della romanziera molto di quanto narrato nel Cazalet acquista un nuovo e sconvolgente significato.Se avete letto la saga allora gi\u00e0 conoscete i punti salienti della vita di EJH, almeno fino alla sua prima giovinezza.Discendente da una famiglia di commercianti di legnami appartenente all'alta borghesia, Jane - come \u00e8 stata chiamata per tutta la sua vita - aveva una straordinaria somiglianza con il personaggio di Louise, la bellissima primogenita del pi\u00f9 grande dei fratelli Cazalet.Tutta la famiglia Cazalet, a dire il vero, \u00e8 modellata sugli Howard, dal capostipite noto come il Generale ai quattro fratelli, tre maschi impiegati nell'azienda di legname di famniglia una femmina che porter\u00e0 una avanti una relazione omosessuale clandestina per tutta la vita.La coppia Edward e Villy Cazalet, in particolare, rispecchia purtroppo i genitori che Jane ha realmente conosciuto. Dico purtroppo perch\u00e9, come per la povera Louise, anche per Jane le relazioni con madre e padre si sono rivelate presto piuttosto difficili: la prima sembrava sempre insoddisfatta della figlia e le ha trasmesso un'insicurezza che condizioner\u00e0 l'intera vita da adulta, il secondo, inguaribile donnaiolo, la render\u00e0 oggetto di traumatizzanti abusi.La Cooper compie il suo lavoro di biografa in modo eccellente, evitando la pedanteria dei dettagli inutili ma al tempo stesso fornendo al lettore i particolari essenziali per comprendere la scrittrice inglese, tracciando attente analisi di ogni suo romanzo nella quali con perspicacia illustra i parallelismi con la biografia di Jane oltre che i punti di forza delle sue abilit\u00e0 come narratrice.Continua su:http://www.lastambergadeilettori.com/..."}, {"userName": "D", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18647113-d", "userReview": "I grabbed this book by accident when looking for a biography of Elizabeth David at the library, but, familiar with EJH's name, I decided to read it anyway. It's written very breezily and gives a superficial, gossipy overview of EJH's drama-filled life. Entertaining enough, but left me feeling very little for EJH, who comes across as the creator of her many miseries. It was an odd biography in that the author inserts herself into the story and offers some pseudo-psychiatric evaluations of EJH's behaviour; her need for attention, love, and affairs with a succession of famous married men was thoroughly addressed and apparently the literary stars of mid-20th century Britain committed rampant adultery with great enthusiasm. Such affairs were as commonplace as the excessive drinking and smoking. Ah, different times. But if you are interested in those times, the larger than life Kingsley Amis and his ilk, -and the women who loved them while trying to forge their own careers-this is a quick, generally enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16009869-helen", "userReview": "Good broad sweep biography, not particularly detailed (there don't seem to be a lot of letters and diaries, or mentions in other people's - yet, at least!), but covers the whole ninety years pretty much, \"warts and all\". I first read her early books long before coming across the later and perhaps more popular Cazalet chronicles, which are really a family saga based on her own family (making some of the early parts of the biography quite familiar to anyone who has read those!) I think her earlier work has been a bit in the shade since the Cazalet series, so it was good to read about some of the background to those too. She seems to have been both lonely and needy and yet at the same time extremely sociable, a strange mix: the descriptions of her entertaining housefuls of guests sound energetic and exhausting but not lonely, but perhaps there is loneliness in crowds. If she has been seen in terms of being wife/mistress to more famous men, this biography helps to redress the balance a little."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2370245-jane", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this biography. I love Elizabeth Jane Howard, in spite of her flaws and for her ability to translate the fecklessness and foolishness of real life into compelling fiction: All the characters of her life (herself included) are there, transformed to greater or lesser degree. I have a lot of sympathy for EJH. She saw having a man as an essential to a woman's life--and this is a commonplace of many women's lives, even into my generation. In spite of this she was a successful and prolific writer. Her novels are still worth reading. Because of this dependence she married an assortment of dullards, drunks, and petty tyrants--with whom she was generally able to hold her own. Kingsley Amis (husband 3) may be a better known name, but I bet her novels hold up better than his.

I've read the vast majority of her novels and her autobiography, Slipstream so thought it a good idea to read this one too! As one would expect, a lot of material was very familiar. Slipstream covered the same subject from the Howard's own point of view and the Cazalet series is very heavily based on Howard's life. However, it was still interesting to read a more 'impartial' account of Elizabeth's life - the book seemed to be meticulously researched and I particularly appreciated the summaries of each novel or set of stories that the author had written and the way in which these fitted into both her life at the time she wrote them and also the past events which inspired them. One thing that did strike me, which I had not noticed so clearly before, is that Elizabeth did seem a little hard hearted in the way that she ruthlessly pursued her romantic interests - regardless of whether they were available or not! It appears that she was quite a magnetic character when it came to attracting male attention and because she was so insecure she did little to ward this off, even if the man in question was the husband of a close friend or if in fact she was already married or in another relationship at the time. I think she was very needy and it is this aspect of her nature that led to the incident which inspired Falling. Kingsley Amis appears to have treated her very badly and I think unlucky in love doesn't even begin to cover it.An interesting read for fans of the author but I'm not sure if those who are unfamiliar with her or her works will get as much from this book."}, {"userName": "Schopflin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27277355-schopflin", "userReview": "As a fan of the Cazalet books, I expected to enjoy this book.
