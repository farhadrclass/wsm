Just wow. I've put off reading this one for years because, well.... I'm a wimp. There, I said it. When one of the most well-known names in the contemporary era of the horror genre says something is his scariest book, I take note. It seems bizarre that I finally chose to tackle this one while having children the same age as Louis Creed's, it was precisely the perfect time to pick this up. I listened to almost the entire book over a 24-hour period while road-tripping, and the experience was unparalleled to any I've had in the scope of reading thus far. Side note, Michael C. Hall was the most excellent narrator for this. What likely was a 4 star read initially became a 5 star with no second thought. If you haven't experienced this version I cannot recommend it highly enough.Rather than a gory, blood and guts type of horror, this is a slow burning, queasy unease that explodes in the final chapters. The suspense nearly did kill me; by the final 25% I found myself wringing my hands and grinding my teeth, preparing myself for the inevitable that I knew was coming, deep down, ever since the beginning. I don't think I could have fully appreciated what King intended to accomplish with this novel if I'd read it before having children of my own. That's not to say that people without kids won't appreciate this as highly, just as statement in my own personal journey. Only King can accomplish so much horror with so little bloodshed. I finished this days ago but have held off on reviewing until now because I feel like I'm still processing and I can't stop thinking about everything that occurred to this family. I had spent so much time prior to reading this book in preparing myself for the big \"things\" that I was completely taken aback by how connected I became to the Creed family. This is why the detailed, slow burn; if I didn't care about this family, their neighbors, and the town in general, why would what happens at the end stick with me for the long haul? Oh sure, I would have gasped and guffawed at the disturbing nature of the plot, but I wouldn't have been emotionally invested. If you've been hiding under my big rock for the past few decades and are just catching up on your Stephen King backlog, like me, I highly recommend picking this up. It's not just about the scares with this one, but the contemplation on how grief can turn any of us into a monster. By far the best audible book I've chosen yet."}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "It\u2019s probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience. On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls\u2014as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything. And the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity.\nIn my teens, Stephen King has crafted my nightmares. I am masochistically glad to say that in my adulthood, that has not changed.He had been responsible for my bedtime routine. Close all doors, bathroom, closet. Check under bed, a terrifying prospect as it stands. Make sure blanket is firmly tucked in at the feet - who knows what creatures might reach up to grab or nibble on them. Make sure blanket is firmly tucked in on all sides, so that only the head is exposed. And still, all that preparation for the battle that is bedtime is nigh useless as the nightlights cast shadows that turn into shadowy creatures in the depths of night. Glints of light cast upon objects are spun by a restless mind into monsters.It has been years since I've read a Stephen King book. That's because my attention span is much shorter now. It craves the quick denou\u00e9ment, a fast-paced plot. Action action action. I confess that this book did plod along in some parts for me, but despite all that, there is no doubt in my mind that King is a master at building atmosphere. He is tremendously skilled at crafting characters, at making them human, at making them relatable in their poignancy, with moments like a father explaining the inevitability of death to his young child. I think we can all relate to that moment.\nHe held her and rocked her, believing, rightly or wrongly, that Ellie wept for the very intractability of death, its imperviousness to argument or to a little girl\u2019s tears; that she wept over its cruel unpredictability; and that she wept because of the human being\u2019s wonderful, deadly ability to translate symbols into conclusions that were either fine and noble or blackly terrifying. If all those animals had died and been buried, then Church could die (any time!) and be-buried; and if that could happen to Church, it could happen to her mother, her father, her baby brother. To herself. Death was a vague idea; the Pet Sematary was real.In the texture of those rude markers were truths which even a child\u2019s hands could feel.\nI would say half the book isn't a horror in a traditional sense, but an exploration of human grief and behavior, and human nature itself can be quite terrifying.That isn't to say that this book isn't filled with moments that makes a chill run down your spine.\nThe wind pushed and pulled its fingers through his hair, and for a moment the old, childlike fear of the dark rushed through him, making him feel weak and small and terrorized. Was he really going into the woods with this corpse in his arms, passing under the trees where the wind walked, from darkness into darkness? And alone this time?\nI've long since outgrown my nightly monster-prepping ritual, but I know tonight I won't be sleeping easily.\n\u201cI brought you something, Mommy!\u201d he screamed. \u201cI brought you something, Mommy!

So, I'm going to link the video so all of you can have it running through your head as well! Kickin' it old school =) Pet Sematary - The RamonesOkay, let me just go ahead and say there will be **SPOILERS** for those that haven't read the book or seen the movie. I have seen the movie about 6 million 5 hundred and 8 times. And I love it! THIS is the first time I have read the book, and as there are a few differences in the book and movie, they both rock monkey butt! The book didn't scare me at all for some reason. I think because of the said 6 million 5 hundred and 8 times that I have seen it that maybe it acclimated me to the book. Although, the movie is still creepy as hell. I totally freaked at the introduction to the book. Mr. King tells about moving to said place, teaching at the school, they had a cat named Smucky, their son was running to the road chasing the kite string like in the movie, but uh, didn't get killed! And some other things. It was like a whole new little world right there for me that he actually wrote this based on some home stuff! Remember in the book where Jud (the wonderful neighbor) takes them out to the Pet Sematary? SMUCKY THE CAT, one crate-board marker proclaimed. The hand was childish but careful. HE WAS OBEDIANT.Okay, so there was a real (I wonder if it's still there?) Pet Sematary and their cat Smucky is buried there and that is what Mr. King's daughter wrote! I mean, I can't even. I want to go visit there now and see if the place is still there! So wonderful Jud from across the road has a great friendship with Louis and the kids, a little iffy with Rachel. Anyway, Jud is the one that has Louis bury Church (the cat) when he gets hit on that damn road all of those crazy trucks would fly down. But little did Louis know that Church was going to come back, even when the poor boy from the school (Pascow) who got hit by a car and killed, came back as a ghost to warn Louis. Why don't people just listen? So now Church is back home and he isn't the same any more. But the family didn't find out anything happened to him while they were out of town. They just think he's weird and stinks when they get home. Uh, yeah! So then, it all goes to hell in a hand basket. Gage is killed on the road. . . . . . and in the movie you get to see who presides over the funeral. Yup, the King =)and then. . . don't do it . . . don't to it. He does it, Louis takes Gage to the Pet Sematary and yeah. . . Gage isn't the same when he comes back! He kills Jud! Damn it all! and Ellie had been having bad dreams about her daddy so Rachel comes home and goes to Jud's house and she gets killed because Gage isn't Gage any more. And Louis finally takes out Church and Gage, but does he learn from his lesson? Nooooooooooooooo, he takes and buries Rachel in the Sematary. Well, you can use your imagination for the rest of that one. . . This was an awesome book to read for Halloween time or any time really but it's extra special at Halloween! \u2665MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"userName": "Johann (jobis89)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50893023-johann-jobis89", "userReview": "\"Cause what you buy, is what you own. And what you own... always comes home to you.\"Louis Creed and his family have recently moved to the town of Ludlow, Maine. Behind their house there is a path that leads to a 'Pet Sematary', where the children of surrounding areas have buried their beloved pets in years gone by. Deeper in the woods there lies an ancient Indian burial ground, that Louis discovers has some sinister properties when their family cat dies...It's no secret that Pet Sematary is my favourite King book, but this is the case for a number of different reasons. When I first started reading horror I couldn't imagine words on a page actually scaring me, I always felt like I needed something visual to keep me up at night. Then I found Pet Sematary... I'd never had an experience before where I actually felt scared to turn the page - this was of course in the climax at the end of the novel. My heart was racing, my palms felt sweaty, I just kept thinking, \"There's no way this book is going to go THAT dark\" (clearly I didn't really know King yet!!). And then it did. And a King junkie and Constant Reader was born. IT was my first King, but Pet Sematary was where I became hooked.**NB Plenty of spoilers ahead**Now it's time to get personal... grief and loss has been a huge part of my life. When I was younger, my dad was diagnosed with MS, a debilitating disease that quite literally drained the life from him in front of our eyes. I guess this is similar in some ways to the Zelda and Rachel storyline, apart from the fact that my dad was never angry or resentful over his illness - or if he was, he never showed it in front of me. He progressively got more and more ill, over time losing his ability to speak, walk, eat. Death was ultimately a relief. But what about those who are left behind? It's strange because even though I was only 10 when he died, which is around 18 years ago, there are still days or times when the unrelenting grief can come out of nowhere and floor me. The loss of a parent is something you never get over, it is simply something you learn to live with. The only thing that can possibly be worse is the loss of a child. King's depiction of the grief and loss that both Louis and Rachel go through is so accurate it hurts. This book really resonated with me on a deep level, as I had never before read such a harrowing and realistic outlook on death and loss. There are so many passages that I've made a note of and will revisit over and over again.The way King crafted a book that is terrifying and heartbreaking in equal measures will never fail to astound me. Because this book IS terrifying - to lose someone is terrifying, to have to try to move on is terrifying, for them to come back \"different\" is also terrifying. Sometimes on instagram I will see people criticising Louis' decisions or making out that he's a bad parent and it makes me want to scream. Grief and loss does not allow for rational thinking. It does not allow for good judgement. It can be all encompassing to the point where you feel like you can't breathe. I defy anyone to tell me that if in a similar position you wouldn't even consider it (not forgetting the fact that there are other forces at work here). I know I would. Couple that with the overwhelming devastation and loss and your decision is pretty made. So to label Louis as a bad parent is absolutely ridiculous to me. Don't get me wrong, there was Ellie to consider, he still had that to live for, but in those heady initial days following such a heartbreaking loss, rational thinking ain't happening.It's a bit of a slow-build this book, but the pay-off is worth it. I enjoyed getting to know the Creeds, watching them form friendships with the Crandalls across the road. All the good stuff, you know, before shit hits the fan. And when shit hits the fan, it is almost too much to take. Gage's little Star Wars shoe in the middle of the road... the cap full of blood. Images that send chills down my spine. Then the unbearable dread as Louis digs up that coffin, not knowing what exactly he is going to be presented with. The way Louis initially thinks that Gage has no head as there is a dark moss covering his face... THIS IS THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES. The little figure appearing in Louis' room as he sleeps, the child's laughter that Jud can hear... Ellie having these vivid dreams and knowing that her family is in danger. This is really a masterclass in how to craft well-written, piss-your-pants horror. I bow to you, Sai King. Some of King's best writing in here and one of his best endings too. There's also some unforgettable characters in Louis Creed, Jud Crandall, Victor Pascow and Zelda. PUH-LEASE can I find a Jud Crandall that can act as a father figure to me?? The adaptation for this book is also pretty decent: Louis is a hot dad, Fred Gwynne was born to play the role of Jud, Zelda will trigger a cold sweat to run down your back...I could quite honestly write an entire thesis on Pet Sematary, so I'll end it here. All I'll say is this: if you didn't feel something when reading this book...... you need to check yourself *insert sassy emoji* Always my number 1 King book. 5 stars from me - obviously.Update: listened to audiobook in April/May 2018. Incredible narration by Michael C Hall. Still 5 stars.

It is super creepy and super \"shocking\" where he takes the reader, and his interesting prologue explaining how he came to write this unsettling tale brings a bit of truth to the story.While truly a horror of a read, it is excellent in respect to its genre, but just awful too if that makes any sense. PS is not particularly gory, but definitely sad, sick, dark, and disgusting with more than one horribly \"shocking\" event that will blow your mind.Take heed if you're new to reading horror as this one will make your skin crawl and keep you from taking a walk in the woods anytime soon......especially if your cat is nearby.\"IT\" is still my favorite scary KING thriller (especially the movie) but Pet Sematary (did I say it was \"shocking\") is a close second, and.......\"sometimes dead is better.\"\nUPDATE: October 16, 2015\n\nWARNING: DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TOTALLY CREEPED OUT!

Fast forward to now, I changed my mind. This book is scariest and creepiest book I've ever read, and I'm sure it'll stay number 1 for a long time. It made me think about stuff I don't want, or refuse, to think about. One being death. Most of us don't want to think about death, 'cause we think we're invincible... But we're not.

In The Shining, there's Jack's alcoholism; in The Talisman, there's Jack/Jason's mother's cancer; The Stand plays on our fears of something, somewhere, in one of those labs, getting out of control; in Pet Sematary, it's the death of a child. So much of the book is completely real and believable: the arguments between Louis and his wife's parents, Gage running out onto the road and getting himself killed, Louis being willing to do anything to resurrect his son, anything. It's gruesome, because anyone with an ounce of imagination can put themself in that situation, imagine the horrible choice: do I try this and possibly get my son back or possibly create a monster, or do I pass this chance by and never find out whether it could have worked?Stephen King is definitely not \"just\" a horror writer. His horror becomes much more \"real\" because he is also writing about real things.This book hurt the most of the ones of his that he's read, and so it took me longer to get through it. I don't regret it, even if it grossed me out a bit. I think it's pretty brilliant, the ideas and the plot at least.

I tend to be speechless when it comes to writing a review for his books, so forgive me if I write less than necessary, because, nothing that can be said will ever be really enough to praise this book. The story takes you very slowly through the life happenings of Louis Creed and his family. Story progresses subtly and ever so slowly. You start to feel a very strong connection developing between you and all the main characters. You start liking each and everyone and everything seems good, but slowly you start to get a feeling that something is going to happen\u2026 something very wrong. And after a little teasing, it happens! You start to feel sad\u2026 very, very sad and right then something else happens that make you feel something more than normal sadness, a feeling of darkness that comes with death.Then comes a point where you just can\u2019t take anymore and you stop reading it. But within a day or two you feel a strange pull and you start reading again... That\u2019s when you find out that there\u2019s something sinister is going to happen, and happen, yes, it does. You can\u2019t stop yourself from reading... you push yourself to read and get done with this book ASAP and then, again, something happens in the end that leaves you sleepless for nights.No, it\u2019s not a scary story, but it\u2019s a really, really dark story that plays tricks with your mind and makes your skin crawl in the most literal sense - It is a Stephen King\u2019s story.The characterization is Stephen-King-perfect. All the characters are so full of life that one can never really get them off one\u2019s mind. The character-connect was built very slowly and steadily, yet very, very strongly. Each and every character has the potential to make you smile as well as cry.The writing is abso-fuc***g-lutely brilliant. You\u2019ll lose yourself in the writing so much that you\u2019ll lose all sense of time and space while reading this book. As usual, the writing is simple and easily understandable. It is full of eloquent sarcasm and abundant with sharp ironies which will leave you obsessively pondering for days.The beginning is slow-paced and subtle. As a King\u2019s reader (and die-hard fan), the easy and happy flow of the book in the opening pages kept the anticipating part of my mind on high alert as I knew that by the time I'll be done with this book I'll be fearful to even think about reading it again.The ending couldn't have been any better. It left me sleepless for days.I loved the cover art of the edition I read (see above), but otherwise, some editions look very old, creepy and even immature :/The blurb definitely managed to be transparent enough to pique the reader\u2019s curiosity without giving much away.You can also read this review at \nThe Reading Bud."}, {"userName": "Edward Lorn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn", "userReview": "Pet Sematary Review (Kinda) I know this review is long, but I have a personal story to tell. Read it if you want to, but the simple fact of the matter is that this book is awesome. If you haven't read it, stop fucking about.\u00a0When I was ten\u00a0years old, my mother and her best friend Andrita took a trip to the local drive-in to catch a showing of Pet Sematary. My father was out with his own buddies, so guess who got to tag along? Yup, me. My mother told me to go to sleep in the back seat, and then proceeded to forget all about me. Little E. was very excited by the prospect of watching a real grown-up's film, so Little E. did not follow his mother's orders. Little E. soon regretted his excitement.\u00a0\u00a0Let me reiterate, I was ten. The scariest things I had seen up to that point were\u00a0the old Universal horror films. But Drac, Wolfie, and that stumbling behemoth Franky didn't hold a candle to Zelda, Rachael Creed's invalid sister (who, interestingly enough, was played by a man in the film). I did fine up until the camera drifted down the hallway of the Goldman house to enter a room wherein Zelda lay on the bed, choking. When that actor rolled over and faced the celluloid, I pissed myself. I'm not ashamed of that fact. Once again, I was only ten. I had been laying curled up\u00a0in the middle of the back seat of my mother's car, but once I laid eyes on Zelda, I crawled\u00a0my pee-soaked ass down to the foot well behind the driver's seat. And there I stayed. Every time I tried to close my eyes, I saw that face. I missed the rest of the movie, but Zelda stayed with me. It would be another seven years before I found out Pet Sematary was written by Stephen King.\u00a0My mother has been a die-hard King fan since she first read The Stand the week it was released. But she kept his scariest novels in her room.\u00a0It, Pet Sematary, 'Salem's Lot, and The Shining did not enter what she called The Great Book Closet (which was a walk-in number filled completely with stacks of hardcover horror novels, which I would inherit upon turning 21; she didn't die, she just kinda handed them over) until 1997. I'd read\u00a0Dolores Claiborne and Misery, but had no idea that such terrifying treasures awaited me. When the hidden novels were introduced back into her massive collection of Dean R. Koontz, Peter Straub, John Saul (which is why I have such an affection for that old hack and continue to collect his books to this day), James Herbert, L. Ron Hubbard, and, of course, King, I snatched up the shortest of the four. I was seventeen by this time, but I still wasn't prepared for the story. After I finished the novel, I had mom rent the movie because I didn't think anything could be worse than the book, and I wanted to prove to myself that Zelda really wasn't that scary. Well, I was right. Zelda wasn't nearly as scary as she had been to Little E., but Grossly-Larger E found Gage nightmare inducing. You see, Gage isn't as menacing in the book. He's rather over the top, and cusses like Regan does in The Exorcist after being possessed by Honey Boo Boo... I mean \u00a0Pazuzu. Yeah, after being returned from the dead, he's a murderous little fucker, but, all in all, he's kinda silly. The movie version is much worse, because it supposes that Gage is still Gage somewhere deep inside. His utterances of \"I have something to show you, Mommy\" and \"No fair,\" are both sad and terrifying. Oh, and in both the book and the novel - fuck Church. Fuck Church right in its\u00a0nutless, glowing-eyed corpse. I love cats, but that one can die in a fire.\u00a0\u00a0Another odd difference between the film and the novel is that Jud's wife Norma and the Creed's nanny Missy are kinda smashed together in the movie. The young women and the old one are morphed into a middle-aged housekeeper with arthritis who winds up hanging herself. Never did like that bit. I suppose this is because I really liked Norma, and cry every time I read about her death in the book. The housekeeper in the movie was just there. I had no reason to care about her, so I didn't give a shit whether she lived or died.\u00a0\u00a0I've told you about my experiences with this book when I was ten and seventeen. I read it once again in my twenties, before my daughter was born, and didn't care much for the plodding beginning and thought the rest of it was simply okay. (I know, I was a dumb bastard back then). Now I'm in my thirties and I have two kids. Two kids that closely resemble Ellie and Gage in this book. Needless to say, this reread was a powerful one, and I almost couldn't finish it because of the feelings I experienced. I soldiered on, though, and made it out the other end. If you are a parent, this novel will affect you in some way. It may not be pretty, but it's striking work of fiction that should not be missed.\u00a0\u00a0Finally (yes, this kinda/sorta review is almost over) this is the first King novel in which King didn't drone on and on after the final horrific scene (if you read them chronologically, all of his other novels up until this one are tied up in one way or another). There's no wrap up. No \"This is where they are now\" mumbo jumbo. It just ends. As it should. It kicks you squarely in the genitals and fucks off. I dig that. I dig that very much.\u00a0Notable names:\u00a0Haven (The Tommyknockers and\u00a0The Colorado Kid)Jerusalem's Lot (Obvious)Derry (any King fan knows this little town intimately)\u00a0In summation: This is the second best Stephen King novel in my opinion. You may disagree, but it's my party and I'll do what I want. The only book in his catalog better than this one is coming up next on my massive reread. But first, it's time for some silliness.

He's this cute little kid/baby who was really lovable at first, but then turned damn creepy in the end. There's this place (at the back?) of Pet Sematary, wherein people bury their pets, if they want them to come back to life. But there's a catch. The pet isn't the same as it was before. To keep the adjectives short, it's now a zombie, and it has this really disgusting muddy smell that never wears off no matter how much you wash it. Was Louis aware of this paranormal phenomenon? No. Jud was just an asshole who apparently wanted to make Louis' life a living hell. If he didn't show Louis the secret place and buried Church in there, none of the terrible events that happened to Louis would've happened. In my opinion Jud is the devil, who got \"guilty\" in the end and tried to stop everything, and got murdered. I didn't feel any kind of grief for Jud. So if Pets can come back to life, can humans? In this novel, yes. Gage got killed by the ginormous trucks I was talking about. Louis was devastated, and there were chapters wherein the death was all in his imagination, then his imagination was just an imagination, and in the end, Gage died. I'm considering that as a really good plot twist. I got tricked! Back to the humans resurrecting thing. Jud tells this story of Timothy(if I remember correctly) and how he came back to life, and also smelled like the muddy earthy thing Church smelled like. But Timothy was also different. He knows all of the secrets and blurts it out. He's also crazy, so just like Church the cat. Despite knowing all the crazy consequences, Louis still wanted to resurrect his dead child. And he did. The result? His wife and \"best friend\" getting murdered, and him murdering the resurrected crazy murdering child. Did he learn his lesson? No, because he did the exact same thing with his wife. But that was in the epilogue, and all I got was the wife saying \"darling\" because he had this theory that Gage went crazy because he waited too long to do the resurrection thing. We'll never know what happened to Rachel, if she became just like she was, or like crazy Gage.

It came to me that reading such a well-written horror book was legitimately one of the most primal, adult things I could do. That's because this type of book can have its own brand of hangover. Luckily, I've not yet dreamed of Zelda, the most terrifying monster in this book. King had a handle on the human mind. He could then - and here did - draw horror-laden imagery from ordinary people. The characters in these pages had life in their lungs. The Pet Sematary is a character. Route 15 is another one. The Creeds lived on the edge of horror, and I feared for them. From the first chapter you knew in time you would pinpoint the danger before the hapless Creeds would. The trials of the Creeds, ignited by the Jud character, and set in motion by Louis, were cruel, but not larger than life. The crudeness I felt, didn't stem from the situation but in the ancient fear of the wild. The fact that there were two kids in the Creed family was not a surefire bet we would be emotionally invested in them. The reason for it was that a great writer at the top of his game was behind them. After all, simply putting a child in the spotlight was not a guarantee we would empathize with their fate. Outside of anime, I've never seen a depiction of such fierce love between two characters as when Louis bonded with his growing son Gage. It was a mesmeric scene. Totally believable. The other child, Ellie, was very thoroughly written into the book. You know, I'm amazed at how much of the scenes in the book have not yet been exploited by other writers and by Hollywood. The writing in the book was so taut. The last chapters duly didn't dally and the end was fitting. There was no drama in the pejorative sense, let alone melodrama. What happened after the book ended is left open to interpretation..."}, {"userName": "Babybook", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28179541-babybook", "userReview": "\u0160to bi bilo kad bi ljudi mogli poni\u0161titi smrt?

The magic of the pet sematary is never explained, the reasons or excuses for its existence are loosely refered to, as its clear no one knows, but that's not a failure on King's part...its just not important to the plot!I remember being kind of bored by the book the first time I read it, and the only part of the movie that ever scared me was Zelda, but re-reading this book from my new vantage point made the tale far more harrowing, the decisions more believable, and the inevitability of the plot that much more unstoppable.

Smatram da je u prirodi svakog pojedinca, ili barem ve\u0107ine, da se bori za opstanak i da se boji smrti, i to kako svoje, tako i smrti sebi bliskih lica.

It likely meant so much to him because of being a father himself. It's actually a creepy book (so much horror isn't actually scary), but while reading it I found it wasn't always the actual moments that were what stood out as creepy, but the theme itself. Grief is one of the worst things in the world, perhaps the very worst thing. Change is hard, but change in the form of loss is unimaginable. To lose those you love more than anything in the world, to have that grief, is a great fear. Life will never be the same again and the heartache of some of it can be so harsh it ends you entirely. So much of horror is aimed at the loss of personal life and fear of the main character dying. The creepiness comes from a monster out there waiting to end you. Pet Sematary takes it even further than that by bringing the fear home harder - it isn't the loss of personal life, but the loss of other lives and how that will affect you. Not just a sad book that isolates grief, but by then twisting it further by turning your own grief - that worst fear - against you. Saying okay, you have this horrible death happen, life is horrible now, but here's a way to stop the pain, here's a possibility to retrieve that life, erase that loss, press the magic erase button. The cruelty in that is the small hope is perfectly squashed when the deceased returns as 'other' - you got your wish, they are back, but they're still dead, they're not the same, and the only chance you have of surviving is to end them again, this time with your own hand. Pretty horrible stuff. And of course the book does have actual creepy moments. The moment in the cemetery where it all goes wrong, where Jud errors and bring Louis despite his better judgment but in answer to an ancient call, hearing the sounds of \"loons\" he's warned to ignore. Louis being told yeah, scary stuff is going to happen, but just ignore it best as you can, block it out to do this OTHER creepy thing and get through it. And that cat Church. He comes back the creepiest. The empty look, the shuffling awkwardness of body, that bizarre stare. Creepy indeed.I've always thought King rocked with villains, works among the best with plot conception and layout, but his weakness is endings. Here he wins because he brings irony into the twist, an almost morbid despair that fits into the story, making it all that more horrible but fitting. I do wish he had kept the mysterious road open. It's fine for early dialogue from Jud to muse about what could cause the sour land, but to bring in the mildly cheesy culprit in the end took away a little magic. I also found Gage's dialogue cheesy at the end, unlike the movie where it actually worked better (even though I didn't like the movie overall)As always, characters fit the story like a glove. Louis as a doctor was a good fit as protagonist - his role in life is healing people, and he's thrust into this mess with this cemetery and the height of grief. Rachel's past phobias with her sister tie into the morbid fear or death and moving into this new house, which looks so perfect but borders on the imperfect. Jud as a man with a history of the town who fits in as a trusted father figure, only to accidentally unleash horror on his new 'family.' The touch with Pascow is perfect, and Gage is an adorable little boy. Ellie is fortunately less annoying than the movie version *shudder*. I wonder what became of her? King put in a few nods to other books like Cujo in this one, does he put a story of Ellie somewhere in another book? For obvious reasons, this is a top horror novel. King's writing is top notch here, not too long and detailed, his characterization fits the story in so many ways, there's genuine creepiness, the theme is one of the worst things imaginable, and the ending wraps it up on in ironic way that lets the evil that always has existed keep existing.

Es la primera vez que leo un libro que me da miedo DE VERDAD. Es que hay veces en que NO LO POD\u00cdA CREER. Incluso llegu\u00e9 a preguntarme si no ser\u00eda mejor dejarlo, porque pod\u00eda quedarse atrapado en mi subconsciente o algo as\u00ed, jajaja.PERO SEGU\u00cd ADELANTE, y... UF. No es solo el tipo de terror de lo sobrenatural, que es fuerte (FUERTE, porque est\u00e1 adem\u00e1s muy bien hecho), sino que tambi\u00e9n y en especial, el recordatorio sobre la muerte, algo que es de lo m\u00e1s natural y a lo que todos llegaremos eventualmente. Y esa parte ni siquiera es inventada: ES CIERTA.Creo que eso fue lo peor de todo, sobre todo al principio, cuando la historia era todav\u00eda \"normal\", y entonces era m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil identificarse con ella. La angustia de la ni\u00f1ita cuando descubre que alg\u00fan d\u00eda todos se van a morir... es muy impresionante y muy profunda. Porque todas la vivimos, y porque no hay respuestas todav\u00eda. No concretas, al menos. No s\u00f3lidas y seguras y firmadas por alguna suerte de secretario celestial QUE PODAMOS TOCAR.A m\u00ed el libro me hizo terminar llamando a mi mam\u00e1, jejeje. Como cuando era chica y ten\u00eda las mismas dudas de Ellie. As\u00ed de vulnerable me sent\u00ed o, bueno... as\u00ed de vulnerable soy, y lo somos tambi\u00e9n todos. Por suerte, las mam\u00e1s saben c\u00f3mo consolar esas crisis (hola, mam\u00e1).En fin, que es muy terrible la muerte. O sea, no, no es terrible, es bondadosa y necesaria... pero no saber si en verdad es el fin, a un nivel pr\u00e1ctico y contante y sonante... bueno, es heavy. Aunque quiz\u00e1 sea cierto, como dicen los personajes del libro, y como tambi\u00e9n me ha tocado o\u00edr a personas de la vida real, que cuando uno llega a \"la edad apropiada\", tiene ganas de partir, ya de forma natural, de una forma casi FISIOL\u00d3GICA. Partir ad\u00f3nde, no lo s\u00e9, pero ha de ser un consuelo que el cuerpo lo quiera. Hoy mi cuerpo todav\u00eda tiene muchas ganas de vivir, y ser\u00eda capaz de saltar a un tren en movimiento si eso garantizara su sobrevivencia, pero igual alg\u00fan d\u00eda se dar\u00e1 por vencido. Sin embargo, como dicen en las pelis, NO ES HOY ESE D\u00cdA, y espero que no lo sea por bastante tiempo m\u00e1s.En fin, que tampoco era mi intenci\u00f3n convertir esto en un tratado existencial, pero eso es lo que hace Stephen King: te hace pensar. Todas sus historias horribles, al final son solo una excusa para indagar en c\u00f3mo somos las personas, c\u00f3mo es la vida, c\u00f3mo podr\u00eda ser la muerte, etc\u00e9tera. Es bastante impresionante y, pese a que estoy traumatizada (o a que me acord\u00e9 de que lo estaba, jaja), es un negocio redondo. Es decir, vale mucho la pena leerla.La historia misma, adem\u00e1s, es GENIAL. Dur\u00edsima y muy retorcida, pero GENIAL. El final, eso s\u00ed, lo encontr\u00e9 disperso y vol\u00e1til, exceptuando el remate que es genial tambi\u00e9n, tanto que me dej\u00f3 BOQUIABIERTA. Y me hizo re\u00edr, adm\u00edtolo, como dice Chaplin \"la vida fuera desde adentro es una tragedia, pero desde afuera, una comedia\".Yo lo pas\u00e9 chancho, leyendo esto. Pero tambi\u00e9n p\u00e9simo, jajaja, porque entend\u00ed a todos los personajes, siendo que no me ha pasado (por suerte) nada parecido. Y tambi\u00e9n porque las partes de horror est\u00e1n muy bien hechas... es realmente HORROROSO. Me qued\u00e9 helada varias veces, con oleada fr\u00eda en la espalda y todo, paralizada en el tiempo. Y, bueno, tambi\u00e9n me re\u00ed varias veces, porque resulta que el se\u00f1or tiene sentido del humor. O sea, que adem\u00e1s es DIVERTIDO.Recomendado, s\u00ed, pero aj\u00fastense los cinturones. No hay censura, ni l\u00edmites, ni ninguna compasi\u00f3n en toda esta novela. Es muy CREATIVA, jajaja, por decirlo de alguna manera. Stephen King, de hecho, dice que es lo m\u00e1s terror\u00edfico que ha escrito, y puedo entender por qu\u00e9.

It\u2019s true. This is old school horror, like the first Stephen King book I ever read, The Shining. In his 2000 introduction, King says of all his works, Pet Sematary (1983) is the book that frightens him the most, and I can see why. Its theme of doing the unthinkable \u2013 making the dead return to life, like Lazarus in the Bible \u2013 crosses every boundary of sane normal behaviour. What King does so expertly is create a situation where this action seems not only credible but natural\u2026 even inevitable.Physician Louis Creed moves with his wife Rachel and two children (Ellie and Gage) from Chicago to Ludlow, a town in rural Maine, where he\u2019s about to start his job working at the infirmary of the local university.The house they\u2019re in is spacious and beautiful, but there\u2019s one drawback. Right next to it is a highway where enormous trucks regularly thunder by. As Jud, Louis\u2019s kindly octogenarian neighbour, tells him, \u201cThat road has used up a lot of animals.\u201d In fact, behind the Creed home, up a hill, is a makeshift cemetery for killed pets, called, complete with typo, Pet Sematary. That\u2019s where many of the town\u2019s run-over pets are resting under cute little memorials. What Louis doesn\u2019t know but will soon find out, thanks again to Jud, is that just beyond the pet cemetery is ANOTHER kind of cemetery. And this one isn\u2019t so cute. Turns out it\u2019s on Micmac ground, and burying things there results in\u2026 well you can probably guess.The great thing about Pet Sematary is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you know where the plot is heading, because King finds intriguing ways to keep you hooked.The pace in the first third is quite leisurely; sure, some bad things happen, including a horrific incident that Louis attends to on his first day on the job. When the subject of the mortality of Ellie's cat, Winston Churchill (nicknamed Church), comes up, it drives a wedge between husband and wife, and we gradually learn about Rachel\u2019s early trauma regarding the death of her sister. King plants these stories like little bombs in the narrative\u2026 and of course you know they\u2019ll detonate later on for maximum explosive power.The author even knows that we\u2019ll anticipate the novel\u2019s biggest piece of action, and so the way he introduces it is pretty damn brilliant. I\u2019m on the fence about another narrative curveball he throws at us, but whatever. To me, the most horrifying things aren\u2019t the deaths (some of Jud\u2019s stories are pretty haunting), the resurrections or even the mysterious, mythical monsters that may or may not be roaming around beyond that pet cemetery. Instead, there\u2019s a scene between family members at a funeral home where perfectly rational humans behave in irrational and horrible ways, saying and doing things that are irrevocable.In the end, whether we\u2019re motivated by guilt or anger or booze or sadness, or an unhealthy mix of all of the above, we\u2019re the ones who contain the monsters. King knows that. And it\u2019s a pretty terrifying truth."}, {"userName": "Laz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22313662-laz", "userReview": "Well, this was certainly the freakiest, creepiest book I've ever read. It was an intense, brilliant thriller full of scary stuff brought straight out of nightmares.It was not a long book and that certainly made me love it more because the story was not dragged on but it was straight to the point. It was not as much as gory as I expected it to be but it still managed to freak me out all the same. The storyline is that of the Creed family moving to a new house. Louis Creed, his wife Rachel and his two kids Eileen and Gage. We get a little insight into the family's past and we just realize that they are all nice people. Bad things start happen when they discover the Pet Sematary, their cat dies and everything starts going to hell from here on out. This book is centered around the idea of death and how some people are afraid of death. We see how people who are afraid of death react towards it and how people who are supposedly fearless of death cope with it. The problem is no one is ever ready for death, we may be accustomed to the idea of it but we are certainly not ready and not brave enough to face the death of people we hold dear in our hearts. This novel is also about how people are genuinely pulled by things they can't control, how they pretend that everything is alright when it most certainly it's not. Louis let something control him, he kept it all to himself and he didn't trust those he loved when he should have. It all ended bad for him and everyone else in his family. Read it but I warn you that it's freaky and nightmarish! So beware."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish", "userReview": "[having to bury a child.
