I admire Marjorie Hinckley, and it was a bit fun to read about her day-to-day life (the sick babies, the traveling, the gardening ...). I also thought it was interesting to get those little insights into the life of a General Authority and public figure. However, I found the book boring.I thoroughly enjoyed Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley, so I expected this one to be fun to read too. But I found that most of the good insightful quotes were already in the \"Glimpses\" book. This collection of letters is probably fun for Marjorie's children and grandchildren to read, but I thought her other book was much more interesting. I also learned a lot more about Marjorie herself from the other one. She is such an amazing woman, and I just didn't get that impression from these letters."}, {"userName": "Adelina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1382079-adelina", "userReview": "I love Sister Hinckley. Before reading Letters though, I didn\u2019t know much about her though, other than that she was the Prophets wife, and anytime I saw photos or video of her, she just radiated love and kindness.Reading Letters gave me such a beautiful insight into Sister Hinckley\u2019s life, and helped me realize she\u2019s just as human as me with similar struggles and worries. The first few letters, as she writes Gordon reminded me of similar circumstances in my life as a very young mother.Now that I\u2019ve finished reading Letters, I\u2019m inspired to write more of my own letters. I\u2019ve been writing my kids letters on their birthdays, but they\u2019re still young and at home. My siblings are spreading around the globe, and because of the ease of social networking, we don\u2019t actually stay in contact as much as I would like. I\u2019m going to follow Marjorie\u2019s example and send a little snail mail love to my sisters and brothers."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307083-kristin", "userReview": "My grandma passed away a month and half ago and as I was packing up her extensive library I found this book and started reading. I love the Hinckleys and I enjoyed reading the letters that Sister Hinckley wrote to her family and the glimpse it gave into her life.I miss the days of letter writing. My grandma wrote a weekly family letter and sent it to all of her children. It kept us all involved in one another's lives and up-to-date. Letters used to be such a vital part of one's life. My grandma wrote so many letters in her life time and received so many. Just like Sister Hinckley she wrote regularly to her children and grandchildren. It was interesting to get a glimpse into the everyday life of a woman throughout the many seasons of her life...as a young mother, a mother of teenagers, an empty-nester, a grandmother, and a great-grandmother. The letters included in this selection are sweet and loving, and while not necessarily riveting, there can be no doubt of the love that Marjorie Pay Hinckley had for her family. I especially enjoyed her realistic commentary about what it was like to be married to a general authority in the LDS church. Her honesty was refreshing.My Rating: A sweet and thoughtful book."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/887097-kay", "userReview": "I so enjoyed reading this compilation of letters written by this unassuming, delightful lady- the wife of a prophet of God- to her family. Her cheery attitude and her recounting of her day to day life and service was truly inspiring to me. These letters made me want to be a better person. I am grateful to her family for sharing them in this book. There are many wonderful quotes in this book, but I think this is my favorite from a letter written to her daughter, Kathy: \u201cI have a new project, 1 chapter a day from each of the standard works. I have been on it for four days and am only 3 days behind.

Hinckley! It's amazing to think that letters were written so frequently and regularly now that we have instant email. This was an interesting book, but not nearly as good as \"Glimpses\" was. I enjoyed reading most of these letters and seeing what a positive attitude Sis. Hinckley had, but by half-way or two-thirds through the book, it started feeling a little more redundant. It was fun to get a better idea of what life was like married to Pres. Hinckley as a general authority and apostle. I was also impressed by her letters because when she wrote them she obviously had no idea they would be published for so many people to read! So it was neat to see how honest her letters were--the reader gets an honest and true sense of Sis. Hinckley's character. It was fun to read about things like having dinner with Jimmy Stewart in 1980 when he came to film Mr. Krueger's Christmas. I laughed out loud at her description of the groundbreaking for the Tanner building at BYU. It was interesting to see more into the life of Sis. Hinckley, and this book left me wondering if I should have been saving more letters from people or writing better letters to others!"}, {"userName": "Sherry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1468288-sherry", "userReview": "This isn't a book you want to hurry through because much of it is just day to day trivia. I see she wrote other books that got better reviews than this one, possibly because she wrote it leaving out the trivia. For me it was interesting to find the prophets wife was somewhat discouraged and homesick when she moved to Denver away from her family. I sure was when we moved to Connecticut with four children under eight so far away from friends and family. The little parts would pop up like when she wrote about President Hinkley being ...sick sick of writing and at other times she expressed the speaking and writing as \"chores.\"I loved to read about the prophet being such a handyman and also how involved they were in their children in spite of their assignments. Sometimes she wrote a gem of a thought as this one, \"It is well into the new year and I scarcely have Christmas out of my system yet, although I hope it is all packed away and out of sight for another year. The very worst part is putting it all away--not just the work, but the melancholy of it.\" It made me feel a bit better about my ordinary life."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/579325-kim", "userReview": "I liked reading this book. The introduction written by her children explains why: \"We hope that you will see [her letters] as a celebration of the power of the ordinary. We hope that as you peek into the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday-ness of her life, you will see with new eyes the value of your own.\" Here is this family we revere for their righteousness and upstanding lives, and this collection of letters shows us that they lived lives similar to ours, except with all the extra traveling and responsibilities. But Sister Hinckley was plagued by similar concerns--sick children, the need to do yard work, and the inability to find cute clothes when shopping. Having read Gordon B. Hinckley's biography, it was interesting to get Sister Hinckley's perspective on their lives. And I think I liked it because I know several of the Hinckley's children and grandchildren."}, {"userName": "Missy", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/963226-missy", "userReview": "Lovely is not a word I use a lot, or at least not whe I am being serious. Honestly, though, there is not a better word to describe Sister Hinckley than lovely. This book was such a breath of fresh air. Letter writing is truely a lost art. It was fun to see into the corners of her life and realize that she had the same struggles many of us face - weight gain, wild children, etc. Sometimes she was even in a grumpy mood (if you can believe it!). However, she got over it quickly and was back to counting her blessings. At the end of the book was a letter that President Hinckley had written to her. It was beautiful. You can tell what a treasure she is to him, and that he was the great man that he was because of her. We can all take a lesson from that."}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1049866-heidi", "userReview": "This book was a quick read. However, I had a hard time being inspired to read it. I am sure that the letters hold higher sentimental attachement to family members.

I was super excited about this book. However, I have to agree with a lot of reviewers. These letters would make a great family keepsake, but it wasn't the most exciting of reads. It was mostly notes about who was sick, where she had traveled, things she needed to buy, etc.  It was fun to get a feel of her day to day life, but I don't feel like I learned much about her.

If you read the Introduction to the book, written by her children, it is very clear as to the reasons this book was published. If you read with those reasons in mind, you will not be disappointed. Letter writers are obsolete now, as we have instant communication audio and video, e-mail, social media, etc. As a faithful journal writer, I appreciated reading Marjorie Hinckley's letters.

I was impressed to read it again this past Sunday after watching the Gordon B. Hinckley movie with one of my boys. I love the candidness of this book, the glimpse that it is into this amazing woman's life. It helps me feel better knowing that even the wife of a prophet was concerned with the everyday drudgery of endless housework/repairs and things as simple as hairstyles and clothes. She kept herself HAPPILY busy, going about the ordinary tasks of life while living an incredibly EXTRAordinary and exciting life. Some of my favorite excerpts: \"Finished the Book of Mormon this morning in response to Dad's challenge. No 24-year-old boy could have written it. People wouldn't get into so much trouble if they read it continuously. What a book!\" \"P.S. Angela (one of her grand kids): In your note you said \"sorry if we got on your nerves sometimes.\" Now I ask you, how could you get on my nerves? What a thing to say, when you know it was pure joy to have you here. Thanks for coming and for just being you. I love you so much.\"Ohhh!

One of those prophets was Gordon B. Hinckley (1910-2008). President Hinckley led the Church from 1995, until his death in 2008, and until her death in 2004, his wife Marjorie Pay Hinckley was always by his side. I cannot think of anyone who didn\u2019t adore Sister Hinckley. She was a small, smiling, grandmotherly type woman, who always had a gracious word for everyone. When a friend of mine reviewed her book \u2018Letters\u2019, I knew it was something I wanted to read for myself, and I am so glad I did. My impressions of Sister Hinckley were of a gracious woman, one who found joy in life, but was content to be in the background. From her letters, I learned that my impressions were correct, and yet I learned so much more. Her personality really shone through in her writing, and I found myself smiling and laughing at her humour and use of words like \u2018swell\u2019 (let me tell you, that did NOT sound like the Sister Hinckley I was familiar with, but did it ever endear her more to me!) and such. If you want to get a more complete glimpse into the life and personality of Marjorie Pay Hinckley, I HIGHLY recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Kristopher Swinson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1180061-kristopher-swinson", "userReview": "I'm not so certain that \"one of the appealing things about these letters is the unremarkableness of the accounts\" (93). It felt as if we had to perform all the labor to glean insights after poring through years' worth of ordinary family accounts. This is partially because she wasn't one to complain (33, 41, 72, 79) or immodestly put anything forward. This elect lady shared her husband's concern for the one (see 234).I was very amused at their busy pace, as they \"were not born to be Saturday golfers\" (124), and \"We had the TV repaired this week, but I don't know why. We haven't found a program worth sitting through yet\" (63-64). You'd never have known President Hinckley had a respiratory weakness (66; see 155), as he was \"always away\" (73; see 75, 78, 147, 161, 225, 240). In 1959, she sat \"in a Sunday School class with him for the first time in 22 years of matrimony\" (80).All told, this is not a time investment for the lazy, and I'd rank it far behind her other writings.

Marjorie's candid and funny expressions on life's great moments and challenges were comforting and inspiring.

It is easy to come away from this book just loving that woman!"}], "description": "When Marjorie Pay Hinckley passed away in April 2004, every woman who had ever known her, even merely through reading her books or hearing her speak, felt as if she had lost a friend. Sister Hinckley looked at life with a twinkle in her eye. Her genuine interest in others made them care a little more for each other. Her quiet, constant support of her husband showed what an eternal partnership could be like here and now. Most of all, her shining faith was a beacon of hope for thousands, even millions of people across the world. Sister Hinckley's legacy of love and faith and humor is preserved, in large part, in the many letters she wrote over the course of the years. Letters is a sampling of those marvelous communications, a look behind the scenes at the life of an extraordinary but somehow delightfully \"real\" woman, wife, and mother. The letters run the spectrum of experience: her trials as a young mother, her musings sent to adult children, her observations on her travels, her words of love to grandchildren. In them, a portrait emerges of a woman whose life is not so different from our own, a woman who took the everyday experiences of her world and made of them something beautiful and lasting. \"Of all the things that she left behind when she passed away at the age of ninety-two,\" write her five children in the introduction to this book, \"we treasure nothing more then her letters and postcards. We hear her voice; she returns to our circle and helps us remember earlier times. In the touch of the paper and the tidy, small handwriting we are tangibly connected again.\" Readers everywhere will appreciate the opportunity for this final, tangible connection with a much-loved friend.", "title": "Letters", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399196.Letters", "average": 4.4, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387730663l/399196.jpg", "reviews": 165, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/226482.Marjorie_Pay_Hinckley", "name": "Marjorie Pay Hinckley"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Christianity", "Religion", "Religion", "Lds"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399196.Letters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8728588-letters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399197.Small_and_Simple_Things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399198.To_Women", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2090536.Mothering", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30133424-she-s-a-mom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1840674.The_Wondrous_Power_of_a_Mother", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
