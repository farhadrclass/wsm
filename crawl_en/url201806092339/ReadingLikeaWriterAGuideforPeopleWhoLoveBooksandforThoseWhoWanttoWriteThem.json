Scott Fitzgerald, and Scott Spencer. Prose is a proponent of New Criticism -- the philosophy that works can be understood only by reading of the work as an entity unto itself, and not by reference to external indicia, like the author's life or political beliefs. In keeping with that philosophy, Prose selects passages that she considers to be prime examples of effective writing, encouraging readers to linger over the words and savor them, rather than speed reading, and to read closely, with careful attention to each word and phrase (a technique you might have encountered as \"close reading\").Above all, Prose admires the well-wrought sentence, the result of a painstaking, thoughtful use of language, which in turn she likens to painting or composing music. To show readers how to appreciate the writer's craft, Prose highlights passages from various authors, examining closely how their language creates characterization, rhythm, or mood. Though you might be a bit dubious about this approach at the beginning of this book (didn't we learn how to do this close reading stuff a while ago, in school?), Prose manages to excite, not bore, with her explication of how to discern the many minute decisions that authors have to make with every word, and how those decisions shape a work and a reader's reaction to the plot and characters. By the end, I was eager to go and read many of the books on the list of reading she considers essential -- her \"Books to Be Read Immediately.\"Of course, as with all such lists, people will take issue with inclusion of certain books and exclusion of others. Some people (I'm talking to you, Bookslut) have criticized this book for its undue attention to \"dead white men,\" presumably because Prose is overly taken with the likes of John Cheever, Charles Dickens, and Anton Chekhov. This criticism is, not to put too fine a point on it, really fucking stupid. I'm all for inclusion and diversity, but good writing is good writing. And yes, Prose focuses mainly on white men, but she also pays close and extended attention to Jane Austen, ZZ Packer, Louisa May Alcott, Mavis Galant, Tatyana Tolstaya, Diane Johnson, and James Baldwin.On the whole, Prose provides an entertaining and wise take on why good writing can move a reader."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david", "userReview": "This was another one of my forays into \"Books about writing written by writers,\" some of which have been quite interesting, a few of which have been useful, but often they turn out to be tedious.This was one of the tedious ones.For starters, Francine Prose (who is apparently a highly regarded novelist with many books to her name, but with apologies, I've never read anything by her nor had I even heard of her before) is very much a literary writer. Meaning, books should be Important and Literary and Art and Say Something About the Human Condition. She doesn't actually put it like that, and she never comes out and says \"Genre fiction is shit,\" but reading between the lines, that seems to be her attitude. In this book full of sometimes multiple-page excerpts from books that highlight her points, not one is from a popular or \"genre\" novel. She makes a few comments about how when she was young she read everything voraciously, \"big crappy novels\" and \"childhood classics\" - before she discovered there were \"good books\" out there.She never names any of those \"big crappy novels\" or \"childhood classics\" that were so unworthy of her attention, but you can infer quite a bit from what she doesn't mention. Like most writers writing books like this, she ends it with a list of her personal \"books you must read,\" and there is a lot of high-falutin' literature (Balzac, Calvino, Marquez, Franzen) a sampling of the usual classics (Dickens, Austen, Dostoevsky, Flaubert, Hemingway), but the only book that could be remotely considered a modern genre novel is John Le Carr\u00e9's A Perfect Spy \u2014 Le Carr\u00e9 being the usual go-to for people who need someone who writes genre fiction that they can grudgingly acknowledge as literary.So Prose (who does have the perfect name for an author, doesn't she?) doesn't have much use for science fiction or fantasy or thrillers or adventure novels or any of that pop culture stuff. Fine. Everyone has their comfort zone. I'm still willing to listen to what an accomplished writer has to say.The thing is, this book, which is subtitled \"A Guide for People Who Love Books and For Those Who Want to Write Like Them,\" is really not much of a guide at all and contains very little writer's advice. It's mostly just Francine Prose's views on literature and what makes for good writing. Her observations are generally detailed and wise and knowledgeable, but it's a lot like reading the MFA or English lit classes that she talks about once teaching. Her chapters consist mostly of her saying \"Here is something writers need to do well, and here is a lengthy excerpt from some highly literary work that does it well.\"Like most MFA and English Lit teachers, she basically teaches what she, personally, knows and loves, so this is a great book if you really like Francine Prose's writing, or you love the same sorts of books she loves, but I wonder what she says to the eager young student who tells her he wants to write sci-fi?Her chapters are titled Close Reading, Words, Sentences, Paragraphs, Narration, Character (not \"Characters,\" note), Dialogue, Details, Gesture, Learning from Chekhov (yes, there is an entire chapter about how much you can learn from Chekhov), and Reading for Courage.Notice what's missing? How about Plot?Now, I'm sure Prose would say that plot is necessary too, but I get the impression that to her, plot is something that sort of happens as a byproduct of crafting your words and characters into the narrative you want to tell. I'm almost certain she's the sort of writer who looks down on writers who start with the plot and consider books to be primarily stories used as a vehicle to entertain the reader.Yes, I realize I'm assuming here. Maybe Francine Prose doesn't think space operas and the works of J.R.R. Tolkien are \"big crappy novels.\" Maybe she is actually a huge Harry Potter fan. But I doubt it.I'm not up on a high horse because I perceive Prose to be disrespecting genre fiction. I try to bridge both worlds, and while I write (unpublished) genre fiction, and mostly read it, I do have some appreciation for the high-falutin' literary stuff too. And in recent years I have become quite convinced of the value of knowing your classics, even if what you really love is fantasy and science fiction. (Seriously, genre geeks, you'll be amazed how much more you will enjoy your genre stories when you catch references and allusions to older, more literary stuff permeating them.) And yes, Ms. Prose, you've convinced me, I should probably read some Chekhov.But, I find her vision quite narrow, not even acknowledging this other dimension of reading and writing which draws people to books.To be honest, I found the author Q&A in the addendum, in which she speaks rather critically and honestly about the publishing industry and MFA programs, to be more interesting than the book itself."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "First, let me get this out of the way: Francine Prose is the absolute best name for an author, ever. Some people get all the luck. Okay, on to the actual book. Prose basically starts by saying, I'm a creative writing teacher and I kind of dislike creative writing workshops. She then spends each chapter going over a specific element of style used in novels - in case you were wondering, the chapter titles go like this: Close Reading, Words, Sentences, Paragraphs, Narration, Character, Dialogue, Details, Gesture, Learning from Chekhov, and Reading for Courage. The book ends with her list of Books To Be Read Immediately, which I found very helpful. The chapter on sentences was my favorite, just for the way Prose just plain geeks out on the subject of sentences: \"To talk to another writer about sentences feels like forging a connection based on the most intimate and arcane sort of shop-talk, much the way mathematicians might bond on the basis of a shared admiration for some obscure, elegant theorem. Every so often I'll hear writers say that there are other writers they would read if for no other reason than to marvel at the skill with which they can put together the sort of sentences that move us to read closely, to disassemble and reassemble them, much the way a mechanic might learn about an engine by taking it apart.The well-made sentence transcends time and genre. A beautiful sentence is a beautiful sentence, regardless of when it was written, or whether it appears in a play or a magazine article. Which is just one of the many reasons why it's pleasurable to read outside of one's own genre. The writer of the lyrical fiction or of the quirkiest, most free-form stream-of-consciousness novel can learn by paying close attention to the sentences of the most logical author of the exactingly reasoned personal essay. Indeed, the brilliant sentences in Rebecca West's journalism and travel writing often outsparkle those with which she composed her novels. This may suggest the possibility that certain writers' sentences improve in proportion to the density and the gravity of the information they have to impart.\" Wow.

I found myself stopping at intervals to try and figure out why that was. Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with a definitive answer. I think, simply, that I don't like Prose's personality. That sounds harsher than I mean it. Put a (slightly) nicer way, she's not the kind of person I would ever want to talk about books with. There is a degree of condescention and snobbery in her tone. She is a literary elitist, and I'm opposed to that.I also felt deceived by the word \"guide\" in the subtitle. It seems to suggest the book will contain practical advice, but the book is anything but practical. Prose moves in the direction of Narratology, but she stops well short, and the reader is left with wishy-washy, half-realized theories. It is more a collection of feelings than a statement of anything definitive.The book follows a systematic format almost without fail. Prose quotes a section of a work of fiction, then spends the next several paragraphs (usually three or four times the amount of text in the quote) describing what happened in the excerpt. She rarely pays attention to the supposed theme of each chapter (the theme being the element of writing she is telling the reader how to read like a writer). Maybe I'm a better reader than I realize, but almost never were any of her observations enlightening. Rarely did I feel she pointed out anything vital, something I hadn't gotten just from reading the original fiction.The only section of the book I enjoyed was the next to last chapter, \"Learning from Chekhov.\" It reminds me of my undergraduate days in music theory, when Bach was always used as the example of how to break a rule in four-part composition. Sadly, the wonderful lessons she claims to have learned from reading Chekhov were not applied to most of the book. I can't imagine this text being used for a writing workshop. It seems unhelpful at best and crippling at worst.I don't care how many books she's published or whatever other successes she claims, the section at the end, \"Books to be Read Immediately,\" is a pretentious load of crap. I agree that some of the books listed are great. But don't impose a reading list on me, and don't hold the whole world to your standard of reading enjoyment.That's what it is. A book full of presumption. But it's popular and well-received. I won't say not to read it, lest I presume the universiality of my own opinion."}, {"userName": "Lewis Weinstein", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein", "userReview": "Reading Like a Writer has certainly made me a better reader, and perhaps a better writer.

I tend to skim books a lot when I get to parts that bore me, and then I end up falling into the habit and skimming all the time. Reading this restored the pleasure and argued well for the necessity of careful, time-consuming reading (I have no idea how Francine Prose has had time to read everything she's read.)My favorite chapters by far were the ones on dialog and sentences. Writing dialog is really tricky, and she doles out a lot of good advice.(Once, in college, I brought a tape recorder with me in a pocket when I was having dinner with this girl I'd known since high school. She was and is a deft conversationalist, and I wanted to catch the nuances and rhythms of her speech and see what it looked like on paper. We sat down at the cafeteria and she started telling me about how her dad was divorcing her mom, and how she herself had been pregnant the month before and had an abortion without telling anyone. I immediately took out the tape recorder and turned it off. I'm surprised she's ever spoken to me again.)Some of the others - particularly \"Gestures\" and \"Paragraphs\" - did not pack the same punch and excerpted too much, ending up like laundry lists of passages Francine Prose liked. (I found \"Paragraphs\" almost unbearably inconsequential. A summary: you can break a paragraph in different places. It affects the pacing of what you write. Revolutionary.) Prose herself is a judicious and open-minded reader, and doesn't fall for the weird romanticism that a lot of writers bring when they give advice. (The sight of a keyboard had better give you a raging hard-on; if you ever write fewer than 93 drafts, you are completely hopeless; spend at least four hours pondering each comma; real writers don't have friends or pets or parents or plants or anything but a desk and a pen and a stack of legal pads; blah blah blah.)"}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Oh, these nuggets of wisdom from popular producing writers. First, it was King and his wackiness (only 2 drafts per novel? HOLY S***!), & sincere cheers (he wants you to succeed). Then JCO, even MORE PROLIFIC (if that can be fathomable) than King, telling you to WRITE YOUR HEART OUT (and basically to keep on keeping on--a writer always starts off as a reader, undoubtedly). Finally, Prose gives us an exhaustive delve into the greats themselves: 100 Years of Solitude, (gasp!) Revolutionary Road, Pedro Paramo, Pride and Prejudice, et al. Sometimes this becomes a hindrance: she gives us selections of select novels to give us a select lesson on plot, or sentence, or paragraph or character or details--too specific though enlightening. So many things go into the construction of fiction--I found myself being thoroughly overwhelmed. King and Carol Oates gave us a confidence that Prose pretty much drowns in academia's gastric juices. I will not, however, say that this was a complete waste of time. On the contrary, after reading this, yet ANOTHER POV is added on to literary knowledge (!!!!): it is imperative to know why writers write in the first place."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42553-shannon", "userReview": "I've never read Francine Prose's fiction.

And it was. Is. Grr. Don't worry, it's not about grammar or punctuation. This is about reading for enjoyment and also for inspiration, motivation, guidance, example.... Divided into chapters on words, sentences, paragraphs, narration, dialogue, gestures - you get the picture - Prose (isn't that the most perfect name?!) uses analysis, anecdotes and extensive quotes to bring books and short stories to life. The first chapter, on Close Reading, was very reassuring and gave me cause to be quite pleased with myself too. (Writers are perhaps the most needy of people, constantly needing reassurance and a bolstering of the ego.) She offers advice to new writers on reading books like 'professional' writers do: I read closely, word by word, sentence by sentence, pondering each deceptively minor decision the writer had made. And though it's impossible to recall every source of inspiration and instruction, I can remember the novels and stories that seemed to me revelations: wells of beauty and pleasure that were also textbooks, private lessons in the art of fiction. ... What writers know is that, ultimately, we learn to write by practice, hard work, by repeated trial and error, success and failure, and from the books we admire. This is so true. From the time I could read - also the time I could write - I was fascinated by how stories were created, formed, structured, plotted. I was the only kid in my class, if not my entire primary school, who wrote what the teachers called \"sagas\" (a new word for me): very involved stories, complete with dialogue, plot, beginning, middle, ending, and illustrations. Even my punctuation - learnt from reading - was spot-on. I'm sure they weren't particularly original, but they satisfied a great, urgent need in me, and still do. I also learnt - and continue to learn - vocabulary: I can still remember discovering the word \"melancholy\" from a book I was reading in grade 5, and it was fun to work out the meanings of new words from the context in which they were used. Sadly, this means I often struggle to give a dictionary-definition of a word; I'm more likely to put it in a sentence and expect people to get it like I do. Better get better at that if I want to be a teacher! Different books got me started on experimenting with different styles. After reading the Silver Brumby books, for instance, I practiced writing description, creating pieces that weren't even complete short stories, often discarded, like sketches. After reading Georgette Heyer's Regency romances (don't knock 'em till you've read 'em!), I practiced dialogue - she has a great knack for it. And so on. The works that Francine Prose quotes from are a little more sophisticated than the ones I used growing up, but the principle is the same. Her chapters on gestures and details is a great reference for me - they're often overlooked aspects in my writing, that still needs a lot of work. I fear cliches, which are almost unavoidable. She leans towards Chekov, Flannery O'Connor, Joyce, Flaubert, Kleist, Alice Munro, Melville, Austen, Paula Fox and Henry Green, for example - only a few of the books she mentions or uses in analysis have I read. A particularly fun chapter, Character, starts with an anecdote of the time when, slightly out of mischief, she assigned a story by Heinrich von Kleist called The Marquise of O- to a group of students in Utah: all mormons, which was about a lady who was raped by the chivalrous knight while unconscious after he'd saved her from a fire (during a battle), and so on, only to discover that the students came alive in their discussions and talked about the characters like they knew them personally. The problem with this book is it gets you so impatient not only to start reading these works of literature, but also to go back over your own writing and see what traps, if any, you've fallen into, or how you can lift up a passage of dialogue or even reveal your characters in a different way. It's definitely one of the better writing guides I've come across - and the only one I've ever bothered to read, since it's an informal guide at best, not at all condescending, and lacks a superiority complex. Prose loves to read as much as she loves to write, and teaches as well, and has a real talent for opening up an otherwise dry passage to the treasures going on in the inner workings. What Prose also mentions is that there are no rules, that every time she tried to give advice to her students such as Don't write from the point of view (first person) of someone who dies in the story, she finds a story - often by Chekov - that contradicts that rule, and works. In this sense, writing is a very distinct artform: you learn how to do it \"properly\", just as you learn how to draw a face with perfect proportions, before you go all Picasso on it and have the eyes sticking out the side and the nose upside-down. Perhaps an absolute genius would skip that learning stage, but if we do it's like - what's the expression? Learning to run before you can walk? It takes time, and patience, and hard work, and perseverance, but if you have the passion it's not painful in the slightest. And if you lose momentum, or get writer's block, Prose has some great advice: to have a shelf put aside for especially inspiring novels, to pick up one author who excels at, say, dialogue, and read a passage at random for inspiration. She even has a list of \"Books to be read immediately\" at the end of the book. For myself, I can say that this works, though I usually read the entire book to get into the flow of a style. Even when working on my fantasy story, though, I often prefer to read literature. I find it helps to stop me from slipping into cliche-mode."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Made for a reader, but strong enough for a writer!Not surprisingly Reading Like a Writer weighs a bit heavier on the writerly side rather than the reader. Francine Prose (that HAS to be a pen name) has taught writing and so that is her approach to writing this novel, which by the title sounds as if it's meant to assist the reader. Well clearly what makes good writing is the stuff readers should be aware of if they wish to get the most of their occupation, so I can forgive her that. Another reason I said \"not surprisingly\" at the beginning of this paragraph was because, well, how much can one talk about reading? It's usually a solitary activity and an almost entirely subjective one. To each their own and they do it alone. The individual sections focus on one topic: the sentence, paragraphs, narration, character, etc. Each topic is discussed at length, often with the addition of personal anecdotes and always with poignant quotes from classics to more obscure writers that Prose admires. Occasionally the quotes become unnecessarily long and in one particular instance she freely admits, indulgent.

Her section on gesture is particularly good; it's easily as illuminating and Stephen King's hatred of adverbs. But I think what I will take away most from this book is her advice for when you read someone's work that makes you feel completely inadequate as a writer, to \"read a writer whose work is entirely different from another, though not necessarily more like your own- a difference that will remind you of how many rooms there are in the house of art.\" Perhaps my annoyance comes from feeling very little joy of recognition other than from books we're all required to read in 10th grade English, and Raymond Chandler, who's so low brow he's high brow.

In this way, an initial reading can provide a foundation, but the chapters remain as toolbox to open when a particular writing challenge presents itself. In addition, Prose expounds upon her own particular literary Eurekas in chapters devoted to reading for inspiration and \"courage,\" as well as an extensive list of works she exhorts the reader to consume as soon as is possible.The tools that shone most brightly perhaps reveal more of me as a reader and writer than of Prose as the author. I just dug the sections on words, sentences and paragraphs; these are what turn me on the most when I read brilliant writing. I love the individual pieces that create the puzzle almost more than the puzzle itself. Each is unique and the skill is in putting them together to create a seamless work of art. Dialogue scares the bejesus out of me, so I pored over this section, looking for the key. I became lost in the excerpt of Scott Spencer's A Ship Made of Paper, a copy of which I've got to find, soon, so I can see how things turn out. Ms. Prose has a preference for the Russian greats: Kafka, Chekhov, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Gogol; 18th/19th century Western classics: Austen, Bronte, Dickens, Eliot, Flaubert, James, Melville, Proust. She references 20th century rebels like Joyce, Woolf, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Marquez, Nabokov, Salinger, Yates and a slew of writers I've never encountered, among them Henry Green, Denis Johnson, ZZ Packer, and Rebecca West. Several of Prose's literary examples failed to light any fire in me. Others, like the scenes from Katherine Mansfield's The Fly and Heinrich von Kleist's The Marquise of O-- were mesmerizing. I've read perhaps a third of the books or authors in her recommended list but I'd add only a handful of others to my TBR list, primarily the Russians, as well as rereads of Hemingway, Dickens, Trevor. But never will anyone convince me- not Oprah, not Francine Prose- that Gabriel Garcia Marquez is anything but a gigantic yawn. I've tried to muscle through GGM, I really have. Life is too short. Must save precious moments to read, reread and savor Austen.

I was hoping for something a bit more formulaic, in the sense of indicating what rules made sense, showing how to use this or that that tool to create such-and-such an effect. Instead, Prose says that there are rules, but here are many, many examples of writing outside those rules. Prose keeps saying that really-talented writers \u201cdoan need no stinking rules,\u201d without the bandolero, of course. This is what makes the book so frustrating. She clearly loves literature and can explain how a particular piece works. So that is what she does. She takes many, many examples of good writing and explains for each exactly what is right about it. I got the sense that she was using these quotes as filler, and I got really annoyed when they began to exceed reasonable paragraph length and go on for pages at a time. It feels like cheating. One thing she favors in her teaching is to read literature very, very closely, line by line, looking for the methods as well as information that is being used and communicated. There is certainly merit in this sort of analysis. And I suppose that is the strength of this book, her ability to look at the many examples offered and deconstruct them.

It's a splendid book because it is so learned, well-written, and insightful, presenting fiction (that's Prose's literary focus) in its component guises of words, sentences, paragraphs, narrative strategies, and telling details.Francine Prose emphasizes close reading to best appreciate literary effects. She's not a member of a critical school; that never made sense to her. What made sense, from early on, was pondering James Joyce's diction, the rhythms of Tim O'Brien's incantatory sentences, the cunning of Isaac Babel's paragraphs, and the mastery of Chekhov's revealing details. In all cases, and many more (she cites Tolstoy, Cheever, Richard Yates, Henry Green, Kafka, Juan Rulfo, etc.) Prose illustrates her points with excerpts that go on as long as necessary. There are instances of such excerpts lasting a page or even two pages.Yet this isn't a textbook; it's more a summary of discussions, observations, and debates that have gone on in writing workshops and literary seminars she's conducted at colleges and universities across the US for decades.Prose excels in offering potential \"rules\" for writing vivid, compelling fiction, and then debunking those rules. Her penultimate chapter, focused on Chekhov, is a study in what might be called \"the exceptionalism of genius.\" I found Prose's defense of the sufficiency of fiction unto itself--not needing excessive theoretical interpretation--effortlessly compelling. Without belaboring the point, she frequently adverts to the ways in which fiction points in directions beyond reason and fact toward paradoxically convincing uncertainties. Fiction is best when it's definite and concrete, yet it is never a math problem with a rules-based answer to the calculations it provokes.The final chapter focuses on how hard it has been for writers like Flaubert, Babel, and others to fulfill their sense of inspiration. Prose makes good use of their letters and diary entries to substantiate the utter uncertainty of a given story or novel, word by word, sentence by sentence.This book will make better readers of writers, and better writers of fiction. It's written with humility and humor. A lot of fun.As a bonus, there is a list at the very end of the book suggesting titles that must be read immediately...as if your life depended on it.

The chapter on character was all right, though she seemed to think that multi-paragraph descriptions of personality were brilliant examples of how true writers should reveal character. Maybe her advice would have been great back in Victorian times (she seems unhealthily focused on the 19th century) but it just didn't work for me.She also described her terrible, terrible weekly bus trip to teach school, when she was forced to ride on a bus for two and a half hours, fearing for her life because of the riff raff she had to share the ride with. I felt no sympathy for her, nor did I understand why she felt compelled to talk about her dark struggles with public transportation.

In this a.d.d. world, it affirms that books, and more importantly, the time consuming process of mulling over words and putting together sentences that convey thoughts clearly--the act of writing, is still valued. Book Reviews in the Times generally go on for 3 pages before even mentioning the actual book and then it gets like 2 paragraphs--with a quick reference to a third book for comparison. I'm fine with that. They're always well written and this sort of reviewer is often not a book critic per se, but an \"expert\" in the subject matter. So historians compare the book with others exploring related disasters/discoveries; political consultants frame the ideas against the prevailing strategies of whatever domestic/foreign policy; and professors parse the un/successful efforts to riff on various writerly, pop culture, way back in the day, or other influence. It's a macro read of the big concepts in a book. I enjoy reading them in part because it's reassuring to know that books are still subjects of and a means to explore big and small ideas.Those reviews make some parts of my brain feel bigger, but they have never made me feel close to the reviewer or author. I'm often left thinking, \"That was a very smart intellectual exercise. So was it a good book? Was it well written? Did it have funnies? Do you even LIKE to read?\" Reading with Francine Prose is like the opposite of this macro read. She's like my new best friend. She shares her exuberance for a well chosen quirky word and graceful sentences and reminds me of the pleasures of savoring each word. She loves to read. She writes well about her love of reading--not an easy meta task. This book reminded me of all the reasons why it's SO WRONG that 1 in 4 Americans did not read a book last year.

And as a hidden gem, what could be more appropriate than reading a book about writing crafted by an author whose name is Prose? Starting with an examination of the individual words used in constructing novels and moving through sentences, paragraphs, and onward to the rhythms that writers employ to convey their thoughts and feelings, Francine Prose supports her observations with generous qoutations from classic novels. Without these rich examples, I wonder if her points would have fallen on me as deafly as did those of high school teachers. During the course of this book, I found myself spending an increasing proportion of time examining Prose's own style, an act that underscored how this book was already changing the manner in which I read. Upon finishing Prose's book, her infectious love of books, left me felling like a teenager with the newly minted drivers liscence eager to take the family car out for a spin, wanting to race to the classics that were quoted throughout, and then helpfully listed in the final chapter.

When I read it the first time, I didn\u2019t find the book to be of any practical value. As a beginning writer, her assertions like \u201cthere are no general rules, only individual examples to help point you in a direction in which you might want to go,\u201d only confused me and I didn\u2019t know what to take away from the examples she gave. If there were no rules, I thought, what was she trying to say with those examples? When she says, \u201cif a gesture is not illuminating, simply leave it out\u2026\u201d (229), isn\u2019t that a rule?It didn\u2019t really help that I had no good grasp of \u201crules\u201d of fiction. I was working on my first novel on my own and had no idea what \u201ccraft\u201d there was other than obscure vocabulary and niceties of arcane grammar. So I put down the book thinking I gained no useful insight from reading it, as my one-sentence review from that time reads: \u201cDoesn\u2019t say much\u2026\u201dNow that I\u2019m wiser, though, I can see what Prose is saying. I do see the benefit of reading works of the masters closely and learning from them. I do believe that the \u201crules\u201d can be broken and reading widely shows us colorful ways to do that. And I actually understand and am impressed by the examples Prose cites.But I object to Prose\u2019s insistence that \u201cliterature not only breaks the rules, but makes us realize that there are none\u201d (250). Because contrary to her repeated claims, there are rules in fiction for engaging the reader more effectively. There are rules simply because certain things work better to immerse us in the world of stories. Whether it\u2019s due to our physiology\u2014our brains are wired to prefer concrete images over abstract ones and pay attention to conflict\u2014or social\u2014as in life we like quirky or strong-willed characters in fiction over weak, passive characters\u2014isn\u2019t important. What is important is that there are rules\u2014or principles\u2014for engaging the reader better.I do, however, believe that blindingly sticking to the rules can be detrimental to the writer\u2019s growth. When the writer knows why certain rules are taught and is conscious of the reasons behind them, the writer is in a much better position, because he or she can break them at will to produce certain effects. And that is why, ideally, these rules should be taught as conditionals (\u201cif\u2026then\u2026\u201d statements) and not as imperatives. So instead of \u201cgive a motive to the main character,\u201d it should be \u201cif you want to make the story engaging, give a motive to the main character.\u201d If you are not interested in writing an engaging story, you\u2019re of course free to break it. Or if you\u2019re interested in making a point about something by not give a motive, then by all means break it with the knowledge that it\u2019d probably make for a little bit less engaging read. The point is these conditional rules are by nature for a specific purpose, and if they don\u2019t serve the needs of the writer, they should be ignored.Prose mainly cites Chekhov\u2019s stories to conclude that there are no rules in literature, but all Chekhov proves, contra Prose, is that he had different goals in mind when it came to his stories: \u201cArtistic literature is called so because it depicts life as it really is. Its aim is truth\u2014unconditional and honest.\u201d And this is only one view of literature. Other writers may have different philosophies and write differently than Chekhov. One could easily imagine a writer who does not break the rules of fiction while making a unique point in his or her stories. In other words, Chekhov broke rules for a reason, and that does not prove there are no rules.  In her uncritical adoration of Chekhov, Prose seems to fall victim to precisely the kind of blindness she urges us to fend against: she assumes everyone should subscribe to Chekhov\u2019s philosophy of literature. For example, she offers one of Chekhov\u2019s stories to make the following claim about motivation: \u201c the bottom line of the fiction workshop is motivation\u2026 all this is based on the comforting supposition that things, in fiction as in life, are done for a reason.\u201d Or about change: \u201cThe point is that lives go on without change, so why should fiction insist that major reverses should always, conveniently, occur?\u201d In these instances, she is presupposing Chekhov\u2019s philosophy of literature\u2014that it should depict life as it really is\u2014and doesn\u2019t realize that fiction \u201cinsists\u201d on certain things like motivation and change because it doesn\u2019t want to depict life as it is, because not everyone subscribes to Chekhov\u2019s view of literature. We focus on motivation and change in the workshop because stories with those elements tend to be more engaging to read, and they are important to bring up so the student writers can learn them and make their stories as engaging as possible if that\u2019s what they want. But Chekhov wasn\u2019t interested in simply telling an engaging story; he wanted to depict life as it really is, and for that purpose, he chose to ignore the rules of good storytelling. So whenever Prose makes an assertion about there being no rules, I take her to mean that there are no hard-and-fast rules, that a good writer should be cognizant of the reasons behind those rules. Otherwise, telling a beginning writer that there are no rules is misleading and ultimately confusing (as it did for me). Just as a practitioner of martial arts masters the art by learning the rules first, so do writers. The conditional rules of good storytelling and good writing must be learned first before one can break them effectively. The danger here lies in learning them blindly without keeping in mind that they are conditional rules, and not categorical imperatives. All in all, while I agree wholeheartedly with Prose\u2019s insistence to read like a writer, her conclusions about literature and rules of fiction are skewed by her uncritical espousal of Chekhov and potentially misleading. If anything, literature tells us not that rules don\u2019t exist, but that these rules are malleable and can be broken effectively in a variety of fascinating ways."}, {"userName": "Robledo Cabral", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5352187-robledo-cabral", "userReview": "Close reading \u00e9 a t\u00e9cnica de leitura e an\u00e1lise textual que consiste em se debru\u00e7ar t\u00e3o atentamente quanto poss\u00edvel sobre frases ou par\u00e1grafos espec\u00edficos na tentativa de compreender cada escolha lexical, cada movimento sint\u00e1tico, cada omiss\u00e3o, cada floreio.

Os grandes escritores, defende Prose, s\u00e3o aqueles que mais pausadamente se det\u00eam sobre cada palavra, burilando seus textos indefinidamente \u00e0 procura das escolhas perfeitas, cortando excessos impediosamente. Prose acredita que, se os escritores fazem certas escolhas com vistas a provocar certos efeitos, ent\u00e3o, a partir da pr\u00e1tica cont\u00ednua do close reading, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel esquadrinhar e iluminar esses efeitos \u2013 o que, em \u00faltima inst\u00e2ncia, enriqueceria tremendamente as nossas experi\u00eancias de leitura.Assim, ao longo dos cap\u00edtulos que comp\u00f5em esse (suposto) guia/manual, Prose se det\u00e9m sobre diferentes categorias narrativas, buscando demonstrar como grandes escritores se apropriam de cada uma delas. Um dos pontos centrais do livro \u00e9 que n\u00e3o existe nenhuma maneira universalmente correta de escrever di\u00e1logos, ou introduzir personagens, ou construir frases. Como \u00e9 infinita e multifacetada a experi\u00eancia humana, igualmente variadas s\u00e3o as formas de evoc\u00e1-la; e Prose percorre um sem-n\u00famero de passagens no intuito de assinalar essa variedade. Em cada cap\u00edtulo, a autora contrasta abordagens distintas de uma mesma categoria narrativa, o que em \u00faltima inst\u00e2ncia nos sugere que a \u00fanica regra que necessariamente rege o fazer liter\u00e1rio \u00e9 \u201cn\u00e3o escrever arbitrariamente\u201d.\u201cPara ler como um escritor\u201d se anuncia como um manual razoavelmente t\u00e9cnico de close reading, mas seria mais apropriado enxerg\u00e1-lo como uma grande ode \u00e0s belas letras.

Raymond Carver, ela diz, \u201cconsegue insuflar um novo frescor e vigor numa palavra que, nesta altura, j\u00e1 perdeu o sentido\u201d.

Bacana, mas o que exatamente isso quer dizer?Vale notar, tamb\u00e9m, o gosto de Prose por afirma\u00e7\u00f5es bastante ambiciosas. A certa altura do livro, ao recontar uma hist\u00f3ria que ouvira de um amigo, a autora declara que \u201cdesde o tempo em que Sherazade salvou sua pr\u00f3pria vida contando ao marido as hist\u00f3rias de As mil e uma noites em fascinantes epis\u00f3dios seriados, n\u00e3o houve uma prova t\u00e3o conclusiva do poder da fic\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d.
