So it's really no wonder, that I wanted to read this book at some point of my life.I liked the story very much. I could see it clearly in front of me; every moment of William Wallace's epic story. Characters were described very well, they seemed very realistic. The only negative thing in the book was the few too short chapters, they really bugged me.

They fought like Scotsmen.\"I love the story and legend of William Wallace. I have grown up with the story and the movie, starring Mel Gibson. That being said, I wasn't a huge fan of this book. It was just like the movie, with some added facts and events, which was amazing. If I hadn't watched the movie dozens of times before I read this book, then I probably would have loved it.\u00a0Throughout the entire book, I just wanted things to move quicker and read about certain events. The parts added about Isabella of France were boring and although I saw how they were needed for the story to fully make sense, I was still skimming them.My favorite parts of the entire book were the ones that included Hamish and Stephen. They are by far my favorite characters and, lucky for me, were seen in most of the book.\u00a0Overall, the story was great, but I would have preferred to watch the movie. I knew everything that was going to happen and exactly how it was going to play out. I knew exactly what was going to be said and how people would respond to it. For me, that took all the fun out of reading this book.

Along with his father and older brother he lives and survives in Scotland. The place where William grew up is Elderslie, lying between Glasgow and Edinburgh. His father and brother are faced with the death of many men. From here you will follow the story of William Wallace.The story begins in the year 1276. On the first day, with the story of some men who want to have the crown of Scotland. A few days after the meeting Malcolm Wallace (father of William) sees suspicious behavior in the barn of his neighbor. He decides tot enter the premises with his eldest son. The story forms her storyline from here.The first five chapters are written incredibly catchy. Randall Wallace knows exactly dose the humor, so the story begins realistic. When William is appointed by themselves, Randall knows how to convey those emotions. That leaves the reader sympathize with the early life of William Wallace.The book then moves on to the wedding of new King of England. I thought this was a major shift, because a lot of storylines start. You get in first instance to the character Isabella. She is going to marry Edward, the king-to-be. These chapters are quite confusing, but it is written pleasant. The component paints a great picture of the chilly Edward and his secrets.The book continues in an exciting battle of revenge, love and action. I must say that the pages really like a spear flew by. In addition, I noticed that the way of writing I really appealed. I felt that I sympathized with the main characters, who also unwise be pleasant and described in detail.This book is one of my favorites, because everything comes together. This book is good, because it makes even a war story incredibly strong. All parts come forward; from hate to love, and betrayal of friendships. I would recommend this book to anyone. The story may or may sound boring, but I think everyone can get out of life lessons here. That's why I rate this book 5/5 stars.P.s. a dutch review can be found here: https://kimberlyhaarmening.wordpress...."}, {"userName": "Kyle Malcore", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47257059-kyle-malcore", "userReview": "William Wallace is a Scottish rebellion that had his secretly married wife Murren get murdered by King Longshanks Village lord. This takes place in English territory prehistoric civil times. The problem for Wallace and his fellow Scotsmen try to rebel for freedom of Scotland from British exiles. Wallace is very successful in a lot of his battles, with his military technique and his own men fighting for Scotland The events that I enjoyed best were how strong the Scotsmen were and how Wallace and clever war techniques such as pouring tar on the enemies battle territory and shooting flaming arrows to the other side, so then the battle would get \"hot\" in terms. The other thing is that I loved how William fought so hard for his death of his wife. It takes insane courage to be able to gain freedom and fight so hard because of that. If I was in that same boat I would not be able to do that, I mean I would try, but it probably wouldn't turn out that great I would direct this book to anybody that likes or enjoys to read old history war books, because in my very opinion this is probably the best one ever made. Also being my age at this young it is and easy book to keep your nose in and there is a movie out there about Braveheart with one of my favorite actors Mel Gibson.

Young William Wallace witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father and brother, and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle, where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough, and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce, the son of nobleman Robert the Elder and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife Isabella of France to try to negotiate with Wallace. After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace.Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan and Mornay, having been bribed by Longshanks, betray Wallace, causing the Scots to lose the battle. As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, he is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert the Bruce. Remorseful, he gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him she is pregnant with Wallace's child.In London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being hanged, drawn and quartered, Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, \"Mercy,\" and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, \"Freedom!\", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Bannockburn, where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom."}, {"userName": "Laila Doncaster", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72486020-laila-doncaster", "userReview": "I read this book long before the movie came out, and glad for it.

Usually when I read a book-to-movie, I almost always love the book more with the exception being The Notebook. This one was tough because I absolutely LOVED the movie before I even knew it was based on a novel and it is one of the best adaptations of a book that I have seen. I wish that I had read the book first because I think that I would have enjoyed the movie a LOT more. I remember when I first saw this movie, I was really confused with some of the military strategies and had to watch the movie a few times, whereas the book explains them quite clearly. This book is very clear, concise, well-written and easy to understand. It's a little cleaner than the movie (meaning that there isn't constant bloodshed described in the book) so if you are curious about the story but just can't stomach what you have heard about the movie (which is pretty graphic), give this book a try. It's not very long, the dialogue isn't heavily accented and hard to read (like Outlander), and the romance between William and Murron and William and the Princess of Wales is a little bit more in depth. There is also a large section discussing Wallace's plea to the Pope for support and the epilogue explains what happens to Longshanks, Prince Edward and the Princess of Wales + the bun on the oven which the movie does not do. The screenplay writers must have had an easy time writing the script for the movie, because the dialogue is pretty much word for word from book to the movie.

As far as movie adaptations go this was pretty good. Great movie Braveheart and just as good as a book. Nice detail to the characters from William Wallace and especially Princess Isabella. My guess over this adaptation is that it was based on a early draft of Randall Wallace's script. Little quirks such as Hamish punching William as a form of affection, the rearrangement of scenes, additional scenes that were probably never filmed or remain on the deleted scenes of a DVD/Blu-Ray release.The story itself is based on historical fact although is grossly inaccurate but I recall from the making of Braveheart from Randall Wallace that the stories of William Wallace were exaggerated even in his time, the tales of Blind Harry which include the 7ft tall, lightning-bolts from his arse bit. Its the same with other heroes like Davey Crockett. Overlook these details and you get a pretty good story of Romance and Heroism and that is not fiction.Wonderful!
