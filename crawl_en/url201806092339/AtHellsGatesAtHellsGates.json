The result is a nifty little horror anthology, heavy on the zombies and featuring some genre writers I'm already a fan of, as well a a number of new voices for me, which is always fun.All of the proceeds benefit the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, an organization that does much to care for the brave men and women who have suffered in the line of duty and for the families of injured and deceased soldiers.For me, it took a few stories for At Hell's Gates: Volume One to begin to hit it's stride. \"Time of Death Perspectives: Ollie Ollie Oxen Free,\" by Shana Festa was just a killer story. It could be because I was already familiar with the \"Time of Death\" world, but more likely, I think it's because Shana \"gets it\" when writing zompoc fiction.Some of the other notable stories include, \"Nefarious,\" by Stevie Kopas, an enjoyable zombie story about maternal instincts and caring for your toddler zombies. I thought \"Journal of the Undead: The Beginning,\" by S. G. Lee was one of the better stories with a new Army Doc volunteering to serve at an undisclosed front line of a secret operation. Yep, zombies.\"Princess and the Flea,\" written by Paul Mannering, a new writer to me, and someone I need to read more of. Quite the original story, delightfully told, and worth the $2.99 purchase price all by itself. They're not all zombie stories. There's an interesting ghost story from J.M. Martin, called \"The Hour of the Beast,\" and \"The Err Apparent,\" a Demon Squad short by Tim Marquitz that is just flat-out fun.Then it's back to zombies with a couple of above average stories in \"Cracked: A Deadland Saga Short Story,\" by Rachal Aukes and \"Undead Britain,\" by Frank Tayell.Overall, a fun collection for a worthwhile cause and a good way to sample a few genre writers you may not be familiar with. One negative is the number of proofreading errors. There seemed to be at least one in nearly every story. I choose to forgive since the effort is for charity, but it would be nice to keep an eye on that for future volumes.At Hell's Gates: Volume One is available now at Amazon.com for just a few bucks and if you are into zombies, it's worth every penny.https://www.fallenheroesfund.org/"}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "The forward is thought provoking and heart felt; I adored the reason the charity was chosen.At the end of each story is a little comment on the story, bio and a few words from the authors. Personally I would have preferred the comment pre the story with the bio and word after, but that is editor\u2019s choice.Apart from one story which was a little too gothic for my tastes this really is a top notch collection and what a great charity to be assisting. The editors did very well to place the stories in such a fabulous order.Black Crow by Devan Sagliani:Poor Tyler, and his girlfriend Emily, he has literally run through Hell to be with her and now they are stuck in the woodshed. They are also surrounded by what seems to be hundreds of crows.As he flits in and out of a dream state in his exhaustion the reality and dream world mix to give a strange foray into a well known burger bar!I loved the personality the author gives his characters and those around them, the perfect pre-undead world that DS paints; I really cared about these characters, felt I knew them.Whilst there is no definitive ending, only mere suggestion at what might happen, which I usually really dislike in stories, I really enjoyed this opening tale. Exploding Shit Zombies by Stephen Kozeniewski:Jake likes to call the zombies \u201csheeple\u201d, their gatherings often turning into clusterfucks! His weird and wild descriptions of the zombie horde continue as Jake brings his motley survival crew together. Jake is an interesting person with some grand illusions and intentions, which makes for some grin inducing reading; until the explosions start to occur. Vera and Chloe are witness the \u201catomic\u201d explosions and the dead pan writing gives its own shudders as you think you know the death that awaits these two calm sisters who are enjoying a beer in their beach chairs.When a swollen zombie explodes all over Chloe, Vera tries to explain the digestive system of a zombie, then lots more zombies start to explode and the mental vision just made me start to giggle \u2013 try explaining that to your non-zombie reading Hubby!When they make a run for it and end up at The House with the Senate in session, you can imagine the comment that ends this story!No Shelter by Lesa Kinney Anders & Matthew Kinney:Derek is begging for money and food at the traffic lights when the zompoc starts. Bikers Hawk and Snake are helping out at the shelter when Derek, freshly bitten, stumbles in. As more Bikers arrive to help and Derek \u201cturns\u201d it\u2019s not long before bedlam occurs within the Shelter. When Snake finally manages to get hold of his policeman brother he gets the full low down on what is occurring. The story continues but felt more like the opening chapters to a longer book. Whilst I was interested in the story it felt a little clich\u00e9 for me but the writing was faultless, just a lot of characters to try and keep up with in the melee of an apocalypse.Ollie Ollie Oxen Free by Shana Festa:Poor Nursing students Ollie and Emma experience their first patient death. After returning home and having a relaxing night, the morning news blasts at Ollie about \u201cthe living dead, cannibalisation and attacks\u201d; she laughs this off as a mid-October scare prank.However when Muffin the cat brings home a zombie she changes her mind; soon she is fighting for her life, minus some hair.The descriptions of the zombies were suitably gross and the emotions and terror that SF has Ollie expressing all had a touch of reality to them. As the slaughter carries on around her, the current storm protects her from the more horrific happenings, but not us the reader as SF continues to describe in lurid details all those horrors.Reaching her boyfriends office she comes to face to face with the dilemma of the bitten person that is still alive and the fear of those around them; mob reaction seems to rule, but Karma is a bitch.To say I really enjoyed the ending would be perverse but I would be very interested in reading more from this author and the world she creates. Nefarious by Stevie Kopas:Moira and Samson have locked their dead, but screaming, children in their bedroom. Moira\u2019s mind has yet to catch up to the reality of the situation as she tries desperately to care for them, feed them, but she needs her husband\u2019s help to really fulfil this task.The disgusting disintegration of her mind, the feeding sessions and the final spousal conversation make for riveting reading.Home Defense by James Crawford:The zombies in this story have a sense of mischief and as Shawn and the narrator explain how they are shooting the invading party I could not help but giggle at the insanity of it.When the zombies actually started verbally taunting back them I was totally gobsmacked! A great short, short story packed with fun and mayhem.Stories from the Apocalypse by J. Rudolph:Excerpts from a journal; Cali it seems is guilt ridden from ex patients to families she has failed to help.There were lots of fly by names which made for complex reading and as I never got the chance to get to know them it was hard to care, but for Cali I had some sympathy. The writing was concise and I should imagine the longer book version would be quite a read as the emotions wrought were quite raw.Journal of the Undead: The Beginning by S.G. Lee:Lt George Mitchell is on a \u201ctop-secret\u201d army base hospital and is literally thrown in at the deep end tending to wounded soldiers.When one of his patients sits up after he has pronounced them dead he starts to suspect where he is and what the soldiers are fighting beyond those high walls. Things get more hinky when he not allowed to administer a \u201cspecial\u201d shot to a bitten soldier.When the Major finally clues him on the situation Lt Mitchell can only gawp. As weeks then months go by the situation, inevitably, worsens and soon they are over run. A mix between military, guerrilla warfare, zombies and a personal diary it\u2019s all a rush of action until the end when a little secret is revealed. Princess and the Flea by Paul Mannering:At first I could not continue reading this as the animal cruelty described in the first paragraph made me feel sick, not from fiction but fact. As I flicked through I noticed that not all is what it seems. We are far in the future in this book and strange things are occurring. The final few paragraphs spell it all out.Well written, thought out and graphic glad I continued.Hour of the Beast by J.M. Martin:Vera is struggling with her pregnancy and at odds with her husband. I did not really connect with the characters or the story as I found the world she lives in a little hard to follow in such a short story. It was all a bit haunting and gothic, not my cup of tea at all. The author does explain at the end it is a fantasy world but I felt it was too hard to enter in such a condensed way, also not really all that fitting for this anthology so far. Shame really as it was well written just not the genre of story I would usually pick up. The Err Apparent by Tim Marquitz:Thrust straight into the middle of some Goth ritual involving chants, sacrifices and lots of black capes and make up, Frank is surprised when this group of wanna-be teenagers manages to conjure up a demon.When \u201cCalvin Hobbes\u201d from the \u201cFBI\u201d aka Frank from DRAC goes to investigate body no.3 he is set upon by the local Reverend to ensure they snare that local cult Satanist! Frank is all there with his usual sense of humour and gung ho attitude, until he is made aware that the demon is actually a Manitou, and it\u2019s on a deadly mission.Lots of action, fun, killings, religious goings on and a few monsters, brilliant little short set in the Demon Squad series world.Cracked: A Deadland Saga short story by Rachel Aukes:A little snippet of a zombie infested world from a military unit leaders PoV. There is a lot of militarised speak and if you don\u2019t know the lingo its hard going.Maz is trying to keep the final three of his thirty five original unit alive and get back to base. The two final paragraphs are so sad. This is a tiny section of a much larger series and whilst it gives you a great flavour of the writer\u2019s style of itself it\u2019s not really much of a story. However, if you love the military aspect of Zompoc then you will love this.Undead Britain by Frank Tayell:A year into the zompoc and Charlotte is a scout for the larger group looking to hide out in the Castle; in the undead world every noise is panic stations and the tension is palpable from the first sentence.Flashback to the start of the zompoc and Charlotte, her husband and children are trying to prepare for the mayhem that ensues at the beginning. News excerpts give us information on what is going on in the rest of the world, the horrors to come.Week by week they slowly realise that life has changed and they are struggling to merely survive. Eventually they make the decision to evacuate.Told in minute detail the pain and trauma faced are excruciating, when the final kill comes it left me feeling bereft; brilliant writing from this author, such skill in building emotion and tension.The Weight of Darkness by Sean T. Smith:Sonja and her team, a post-apocalyptic commando team called the Foxes, are hiding out in the Vatican. The apocalypse was over twenty five years ago but the nuclear war was just starting.Stuck in Europe having travelled by foot from Africa they are trying to reach home in Wyoming, USA. The plague that surrounds them is a new twist on the zombie theme, highly interesting concept.Having only known survival and not living Sonja is an interesting character that I look forward to following up in this authors series of novels.The Husband by Jacqueline Druga:Miriam\u2019s husband seems to have deteriorated and she wants to kill him. She has focus, she has reasons, she has ideas and she has a best friend!Short, snappy, funny and brilliantly written. Fabulously wicked.Seth by Jacqueline Druga:Jena has a sort of second sight gift, not strong and not enough to earn a living by but enough. Whilst waiting to read a local medic in a coffee shop she meets Seth.With an enigmatic invite she is hooked. During their discussion many strange things are said and done. When Mrs Williams comes for a reading and she is told to hand over the envelope the story truly starts to unfold.A sad happy ending with a little spooky feel.The Fertile by Jacqueline Druga:A strange little story that seemed to have no purpose other than to confuse and amuse, which it did very well! I really like this author and hope to find more of her work.Welcome to Hell by Sharon Stevenson:Vampire hunters on Halloween! Shaun and Sarah, siblings that are chosen ones.With all the normal vamp killing clich\u00e9s in a supernatural nightclub called Haven, this was like a good Buffy episode.I love this world the author has created and will be seeking this series out."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11288298-mike", "userReview": "This book is hard not to like. First off, all the proceeds go to wounded veterans, which is a good reason to buy it on its own. Second, it offers some top-notch entertainment for the price. Third, it expands on several popular zom-poc universes that the reader will likely recognize.At Hell's Gate is a new anthology of stories by a group of authors primarily known for their work with zombies for Permuted Press and edited by well-known editor Monique Happy and James Crawford (who also contributed a story to the anthology). The editing is great, and I found very little that I could pick at. As is usual, the stories run the gamut of tastes and styles, but I'll do my best to hit each one.Black Crow Laughing by Devan Sagliani covers events in his Undead L.A. universe and recounts the events of two young kids in love as they try to survive trapped in a zombie-surrounded shed. The main character recounts how they came to find themselves there and then describes their eventual attempt to escape. The story is good, providing both action and character development in equal draughts. It's one downfall for some might be that it's the kind of zombie story you've read before, but that is not going to be a bad thing for hardcore zombie fans.The raucously titled Exploding Shit Zombies by Stephen Kozeniewski adds some flavor to the events in his novel The Ghoul Archipelago, and fans of that book will notice a few nods to it. The story is fast-paced and humorous in a way that I think many will enjoy. It also makes an interesting point or two about zombie biology and how hordes of a different kind might form, which I liked. It's a little short on character development, but it's too enjoyable for the reader to really care. One of the top stories in the book for me.No Shelter by Lesa and Matt Kinney delves into their own Dead, but Not for Long books and details a group of bikers and homeless people who try to protect themselves from a burgeoning zombie crisis. I have not read this book series, so I cannot comment on what it adds to their lore, but as an outsider there were a lot of characters to follow. I was not a big fan of the general writing style personally, though it is decently written. The dialogue also did not work for me in whole, but I suspect that there are plenty of people who will like it. The pacing and plot are good, but not quite distinct enough from the typical NotLD scenario to really grab me. To a degree, you can't go into an anthology expecting to click with every story, but I try to remember that just because I did not like the story does not make it poorly-written. I'll give the authors some credit for subverting the usual trend of bikers as bad guys trope that we often see in zombie novels. Furthermore, the main character is far from infallible and as the reader I felt like he actually feels bad about some of the choices he made, which was an accomplishment for the writers I think.Ollie Ollie Oxen Free by Shana Festa is an addition to the Time of Death universe and chronicles the attempts of one of Emma Rossi's nursing friends as she attempts to escape the growing zombie crisis. The story is good and adds a bit to the lore of ToD, particularly since I had wondered what had happened to Ollie after reading Induction. The pacing moves the story along at a good clip and the writing is entertaining. The tone and style of writing are in keeping with ToD, which is good for those who liked it. It's not quite my speed, but as I said, I liked the story all the same.Nefarious by Stevie Kopas is the origin story of Moira from her Breadwinner Trilogy and her attempts to come to grips with the apocalypse. Though I've not read her books, this story was good. The characters are sketched out well and those we're not supposed to like feel appropriately evil and detestable. Overall, it was enjoyable as a standalone, and likely welcome for those who have read the series.Home Defense By James Crawford expands on the Blood Soaked and Contagious series and follows two men as they attempt to protect their neighborhood from the unique and foul-mouthed dead of those books. While it's an entertaining and well-written story, I'm not sure that I got all I could out of it having not read the books. Regardless, as a standalone, it was a fun read.Stories From the Apocalypse by J. Rudolph is an internal recounting of events by a young woman caught up in the zombie holocaust and her reconciling the decisions she's made. Though connected to a book series that has not yet been released, which bears some problems as possibly spoiling some of the surprises contained therein, it is a well-done character exploration that weightily conveys the mourning and regret the narrator's regret about some of the choices she's made. If the whole book is as good as this book, it ought to do well.Next is Journal of the Undead: The Beginning by S.G. Lee, from his upcoming Journal of the Undead book. It tells the tale of a young Army doctor sent to a secret military facility in the steamy jungles of South America. As time goes on, though, he finds that things are more than they seem. I enjoyed this story \u2013 the action and pacing were good, and the characters were likeable. Not only that, but it brings a much-appreciated change of scenery from suburban America as the backdrop for it's story. I'm a bit picky about military based stories, just because of my interests and reading on the subject, but this one does a decent job of getting a feel for it, though it might distract some. There are a few times where the dialogue doesn't feel quite right, but they're easily overlooked.Hour of the Beast by J.M. Martin has the distinction of being the first non-zombie story of the bunch, and it retells the story of a young pregnant woman as she tries to find out why her once-doting husband has become cold and angry towards her. The writing on this one is good, and the medieval, fantasy tone of it is handled well. Definitely worth a read.The Err Apparent by Tim Marquitz follows the devil-related monster hunter of Demon Squad fame as he attempts to hunt down a shadowy killer stalking around a small New Mexico town. This one is great \u2013 it has the horror and humor feel of the TV show Supernatural, and the action, pacing, and characters are all engaging. This story did exactly what it set out to do: it entertained, but also made me want to seek out the author's other work as well. A top choice for me.Cracked: A Deadland Saga short story by Rachel Aukes tells of the remnants of an Army platoon attempting to escape Des Moines, Iowa after it's been overrun with the dead and before it gets bombed into dust. As the title suggests this is connected to the Deadland Saga books. This one did not quite do it for me; not because it was badly written or unentertaining, but the characters as soldiers did not feel quite real. I'm certainly no expert on the subject, but it just did not feel right to me in terms of lingo and attitude. There's not a bad story in the book, however, and I certainly did not feel cheated of my time to have read this one.Undead Britain by Frank Tayell is a story in his The Evacuation world and tells of a woman's trials as she attempts to flee a zombie-infested London with her family, and her determination to keep a promise to someone no matter the cost. This is another decent story, and it's well written, but personally, it did not quite grab me and suck me in as some of the others did. The characters are well-defined, however, and for those who like a lower-key less action-y zombie tale, they'll like this one.The Weight of Darkness by Sean T. Smith occurs in his Wrath universe and covers the exploits of a small special forces unit trying to navigate through a disease and madness-riddled Europe (the Vatican in particular as it so happens). Anyone who has read my reviews of the first two books in this series will not be surprised when I say I liked this story. Lean, balanced, and enticing the reader with just enough information to want to read the next book in the series. Anyone looking for a non-zombie, non-EMP apocalypse story should go right to this one like I did. Then go read Objects of Wrath and Children of Wrath. They're both worth it.Jacqueline Druga finishes up with a trio of stories The Husband, Seth, and The Fertile. Each is quite distinct from the other \u2013 the first is a Tales From the Crypt-type story of a fed-up wife who kills her husband in a very unique way. Seth is the story of a minor psychic who's asked to complete a task for a strange young man and reaps an unexpected rewards as a result. Finally, The Fertile tells a story of a young adventurer trying to slip unnoticed through the realm of giant alien Gods in order to help his people. Druga knows how to write characters, and for that she's become popular with many. I tend not to get into her stories personally as they tend to fall more into the drama vs. action realm which I'm more drawn to. That's not to say that the stories are bad though, and some readers will definitely enjoy that her stories are all a bit more subdued than the zombie apocalypse or hunting demons.All-around it's worth the meager asking price particularly considering all the authors donated their time and talent to the anthology for nothing in return. The stories are all entertaining in one form or another and many of them expand on universes that the reader may already be familiar with. In a few cases it may spur them to check out something new."}, {"userName": "Reyna Pryde", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21759220-reyna-pryde", "userReview": "Where do I begin? First, I should tell you that I am more of a paranormal romance/urban fantasy kinda girl when it comes to books. But with The Walking Dead still on hiatus and Halloween right around the corner, I needed a few zombies in my life. I figured I couldn't go wrong with a horror anthology featuring seventeen different authors and their short stories for only $2.99. Even if I ended up slightly disappointed with the content, which I wasn't, my three dollars would still be well spent since all the proceeds are for charity.I was actually really pleased with my purchase; so much so, that I may have found a few new authors and a new genre to sink my claws into. Because there are so many stories involved in this anthology, I will just tell you a few that really caught my attention and tell you (as spoiler free as possible) why.Time of Death Perspectives: Ollie Ollie Oxen Free by Shana Festa is a story about a nursing student name Olivia, Ollie for short, trying to survive a sudden zombie outbreak while searching for her on again/off again boyfriend Eddie. It is hard to imagine myself in the world Ollie has been thrust into, but I found myself relating to Ollie's plight. The twist at the end of this story waged a war in me. The HEA girl in me and my darker side fought to reconcile with this tragic tale. As a short story, this tale had an absolute ending. Still, I was intrigued enough to add Mrs Festa to my list of authors to look for in the future. Her writing pulled me in and I am willing to read more about the world she has created even if Ollie might not have a part to play.Nefarious by Stevie Kopas was another tale that brought out the evil in me. Moira Eckhart is a privileged rich mother who seems to have lost all her marbles. Set in the world of the undead, we actually see very little of the world outside of Moira's upscale suburban home. Until the zombie apocalypse, Moria never seemed to notice her two children. With the end of the world destroying her materialistic life, Moria finds comfort in a fantasy world where she isn't the terrible mother she has always been. I found myself reading about Moira and, although I could never relate to her insanity, I loved how rational she was throughout the story. Her twisted mind found some peace in caring for her babies, even if fulfilling their needs should have trigger some moral alarm. As a short story, I found myself truly enjoying Moira's character, but I don't think I could read a whole novel inside of a mind as sick as hers. Lucky for me, I read the info after the story and learned that Moira plays a small part in a much larger story. I hope to read more about her insanity and what other great characters this author can conjure up.Journal of the Undead: The Beginning by S.G. Lee is a rich tale about a young Lieutenant and 'soon-to-be' doctor named George Mitchell. George takes on a top secret assignment, his first assignment, deep in a rainforest where the military seems to be fighting some unknown enemy. Kept in the dark, Dr Mitchell starts to learn about this unknown enemy and the truth is far worse than rebels with guns. The dead are rising and no matter how many men leave the base to quell the rising numbers of infected, their efforts seem to be in vain. I loved the world created by this exceptional author! I felt all Dr Mitchell's emotions as he worked out the mystery beyond the walls of his camp. He faced moral dilemmas and his intelligence proved to save his life more than once. When the story was over I wanted more and I was pleased to learn Journal of the Undead: The Beginning is the start of a new series which is scheduled to be released later this year.The Hour of the Beast by J.M. Martin is quite a creepy tale. I won't go into detail, except to say I could see this unusual short fitting right in with all those old Twilight Zone episodes. The ending taunted me, leaving me with more questions than answers and I do appreciate a good mystery to keep my mind spinning.The Err Apparent by Tim Marquitz is much closer to my normal read. A tale full of humor, magic, and demons, I found myself right at home within this story. I loved the unexpected ending as well.The Weight of Darkness by Sean T. Smith stood out among the so many others, for me, because of the strong, badass Sonja Larson. As a avid reader of Urban Fantasy, I love a tough warrior woman in my stories. Sonja was definitely that, yet I still saw the softer side of her and got that tiny bit of romance I always crave in my books.Jacqueline Druga proved an exceptional storyteller with her three very short stories which were all original and very well written. Each story verified Druga as an author who has the potential to excel in various genres. I intend to look for more of her work in the future.Welcome to Hell by Sharon Stevenson was another story which made me feel right at home within this anthology. A strong, independent female who just happens to be a demon tracker \u2026 yeah, I am in! Of course, her brother seems to be the protagonist of the story and he is more of a sidekick to his overachieving sister. The dynamic between the siblings was fun and I do believe I will be looking into the series behind their short adventure!Overall, this group of short stories has something for every fantasy reader & gives readers a chance to meet an amazing group of authors!"}, {"userName": "Jack", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7924933-jack", "userReview": "I have always enjoyed reading these anthology's or collected work's of authors, but when some of my Fav' authors I follow bring a collection together and for a cause, I am interested in the cause and then hope I enjoy most of the story's that have been selected, really you cant please me...err everyone All the time' This collection really makes a great attempt at doing just that, I enjoyed this group of stories very much and even forgot my habitual \"skipping\" around and was reading the next story right after the last, and the best thing with collections like this is the introduction to some great new author's that you might follow in the future.

The first few stories were a little similar but the book picks up a little during the second half."}, {"userName": "Carrie Slager", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8854256-carrie-slager", "userReview": "[Full disclosure: I was contacted by one of the authors and received a free ebook from them in exchange for an honest review.]I don\u2019t normally post anything on Remembrance Day out of respect, but I thought this was the perfect book to review as all proceeds go to The Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund. You can\u2019t pick out a more worthy cause than that.As you guys have probably picked up on by now, I\u2019m not a big anthology fan. Usually there\u2019s one or two stories by authors I know and like and the rest aren\u2019t very interesting or are pretty poorly written. There have been a few exceptions, but I generally try to avoid reading anthologies for just those reasons. I was a little skeptical reading this anthology because I\u2019d never even heard of any of the authors, but the blurb intrigued me enough that I decided to give it a go. This isn\u2019t just zombie fiction, after all; it also includes stories with other horror elements like vampires and ghosts.I have to say that I was just blown away by this anthology. There were so many amazing stories in it that I find it hard to name all of my favourites. And in all honesty, I don\u2019t think I could name a story that I actively disliked. There were some that I felt were \u2018meh\u2019 but none that I thought were bad and shouldn\u2019t have been included. All of the stories were well written and well-edited, so much so that I have added several new authors and books to my enormous to-read list. Sharon Stevenson\u2019s story Welcome to Hell and Seth by Jacqueline Druga in particular stood out to me.At Hell\u2019s Gates is a very well-edited anthology. I think I caught maybe one typo in the whole thing, but it\u2019s more than that. The stories were very well put together so as to make the anthology flow. There was a large variety of stories and the order was rotated so that you didn\u2019t have two intelligent zombie stories one after another or a run of three quasi-military survival group stories. Seeing as I read the whole anthology in one sitting, I particularly appreciated this attention to little details like making sure there was a wide variety of stories and that similar themes were spaced out well.In this anthology there are intelligent zombies, traditional Voodoo zombies and modern Walking Dead-esque zombies. There\u2019s really something for everyone and even if you don\u2019t like zombies, there are plenty of stories that focus on other horrifying creatures like vampires and ghosts. And you certainly can\u2019t deny that the anthology goes to a good cause.So go out this Remembrance Day and get some excellent new reading material while supporting our troops.I give this anthology 5/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383239-autumn", "userReview": "I received this book to give an honest review.I have to say I was impressed with how well written all the stories were. Each story kept me wanting to read more. Now there were a few not many more like two or three stories that I didn't quite enjoy as much as others.At Hell's Gate there is a little something for everyone. There is humor, death, and probably what some would call horror all mixed into this book.While reading I came across a lot of different authors I have not heard about before and I will be looking into their works to see what else they have out there. There are some zombie stories but not all of them are zombies, some deal with with vampires, demons and a little bit more.With each story you get great character building, the worlds that are created are very descriptive and you just end up wanting more.It was hard to pick my favorite story of all, but I have to say the one that literally sticks out to me is the story of Exploding Shit Zombies.

She is a character in another book which I loved. And we get to find out her fate, she was a minor character in the book Time of Death by Shana Festa so she is someone you may or may not have remembered.Not only is this an amazing anthology, the proceeds are going to The Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund which I think is an awesome idea.

Some of these novels I've read, and they were awesome. Now there's a few I'll be adding to my list.I liked the idea that the majority of the stories within are based on novels that are currently out, or within the same world. The majority of them are zombie apocalypse based so as you imagine, there is a lot of action and mayhem. But, not every story turned out the way I anticipated, which was fantastic.My top five favorites were:Nefarious by Stevie Kopas because it related to a trilogy that I'd read by her and kind of showed a blow by blow of the disturbing state of mind that woman was in.\u200bHome Defense by James Crawford because the characters were so sarcastic and fun they seemed so vibrant.Exploding Shit Zombies by Stephen Kozeniewski. I hope the title can speak for itself, but I found it to be just gross and funny all at the same time.The Husband by Jacqueline Druga. After loads of zombie apocalypse stories this took me off guard, and had me laughing.Princess and the Flea by Paul Mannering stopped me cold! It was twisted, engaging and was told from the simple viewpoint of a child. I popped the book it was based on straight into my wishlist. The transition from the child's view vs. what we should be seeing was so subtle, and took me off guard.CONCLUSIONI don't think you'll find many similar stories in here.

Then a demon story. Then it went back to a few more zombies tales before three stories in a row from Jacqueline Druga (not about zombies), and finally, it ended on a story about twin demon hunters. It was a nice surprise to read a few non-zom adventures, but I think the order of stories in the first part of the book could\u2019ve been shuffled around a bit better.In regards to the zombie stories, unfortunately most of them don\u2019t exactly reinvent the genre. There are tales of boy saving girl, some journal entry-style stories, even some stories of people (be it military or civilian) trapped in the big city swarming with the undead. There\u2019s nothing wrong with those plots, and a good chunk of them are very well-told, it\u2019s just that same old feeling of been there, done that.And then there\u2019s \u201cExploding Shit Zombies\u201d by Stephen Kozeniewski, which raises the question we really should\u2019ve been asking ourselves all along: \u201cCan zombies poop?\u201d I thought this was the best of the zombie bunch thanks to its sharp humour and the nice little zinger, the kind that makes you want to hit the cymbals (y\u2019know, ba-dum-ch), at the end.A good thing about the zombie stories is that even though the plots may be recycled, the worlds are brand new. Some zombies run, some walk, some even hurl insults at you (hands down, that would be the worst way to die. It wouldn\u2019t help your self-esteem one bit). Some of the stories start at the very beginning of their respective zompocalypses while others take place well into the end times. Some characters know how to properly dispose of the walking dead while others don\u2019t even know that a bite transmits the virus. And hey, there are even a few stories that aren\u2019t afraid to use the Z word.Non-zom-wise, one of the better stories in the whole anthology (but at the opposite end of the spectrum from \u201cExploding Shit Zombies\u201d) is \u201cThe Hour of the Beast\u201d by J.M. Martin. It\u2019s about a pregnant woman, her suspicious husband and a vengeful spirit. I don\u2019t want to say much more than that, but it has a great build-up that leads to a nasty ending.Jacqueline Druga contributed three stories to the anthology, stories that focus more on the relationships of the characters rather than the horrors unfolding around them (though the horrors unfolding around are still pretty...horrific). Her contributions are a nice change of pace from everything else.But overall it was nice to have a variable melting pot of stories. This anthology started as an idea in contributor Devan Sagliani\u2019s writing group. The group chose to donate proceeds from this anthology to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, which cares not only for injured soldiers but families of the injured and deceased. That\u2019s a commendable feat, and no matter what I say, you should buy this book for that reason alone."}, {"userName": "C.T. Phipps", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5873287-c-t-phipps", "userReview": "Charity and horror fiction. Three words which do not normally go together but, honestly, should. All profits from At Hell's Gates sales go to The Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund. This gesture is something which naturally inclined me to like this book and its contents but I'll try to keep an unbiased perspective to the writing. This is a collection of a dozen or more short-stories which chronicle the adventures of various heroes as they deal with increasingly bad situations. They're the heroes facing hell (hence the title) and, in many ways, this is a surprisingly uplifting book. The heroes rarely come to a bad end and, when they do, it is a genuine surprise. At Hell's Gates is a book by such notable indie horror authors as Jacequline Druga (Contagion), Stephen Kozeniewski (Braineater Jones), Shana Festa (Time of Death), Stevie Kopas (The Breadwinner), and Paul Mannering (Tankbread). Quite a few of the vignettes deal with the characters from these works and if you're familiar with any of them, you're probably going to get more out of the stories than someone who is not. At Hell's Gates is a mixture of good, okay, and stories I found myself indifferent to. My favorite story is probably The Err Apparent by Tim Marquitz, which is a R-rated version of the Dresden Files with the Devil's nephew as its protagonist. Another standout is The Princess and the Flea by Paul Mannering. I wasn't familiar with either work beforehand but both were incredibly enjoyable and encouraged me to check out their universes. Some of the stories are ones that weren't so great, however. None of them were bad, per say, but some of them felt like they were teasers for the book worlds they came from rather than complete stories themselves. The best of At Hell's Gates is when the tales decide to show something in its entirety. Journal of the Undead: The Beginning by S.G. Lee is an example of one of the complete stories which is stronger for it. If there's a flaw with At Hell's Gates, it's the fact the vast majority of the stories are zombie ones. I think the anthology promoters would have done well to highlight this fact. Calling it At Hell's Gates: Zombies or something similar might have made things better, IMHO. Here, I expected a more diverse variety of stories and found, instead, a zombie anthology with a few outliers. Not every story will blow you away but it has a pretty good average against professional anthologies I've read. There's also some real gems in it as well. Given it is less than half the price of a comparably sized independent book, I think it's well worth the price to check out. The fact the profits go to charity also means that I encourage horror fans to pick it up. In conclusion, At Hell's Gates is a worthy edition to any horror fan's e-library.7.5/10"}, {"userName": "Veronica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25954528-veronica", "userReview": "There is so much to like about this anthology.

The overall theme of this series is general horror, but this volume leans heavily on zombie apocalypse related tales from authors with books already out on that subject matter. The stories told here are tied in with their other works, giving a short story that sometimes lies at the periphery of the world they have created or serves as an new slant on characters a reader of those works is already familiar with. Overall, the work here is solid and the writing entertaining. This book serves more as a sampler platter of various author\u2019s works rather than standalone tales except in a few cases, although little is lost in translation if you hadn\u2019t read any of the books from the author\u2019s bibliography. For example, I have read Stephen Kozeniewski\u2019s work, The Ghoul Archipelago and his short here is based on the world we see in that novel, but I have not read anything from Stevie Kopas, but her tale of murder and insanity stands on its own quite well, though it is a part of a bigger world the author has created in her novels. The only criticism I have of the layout of this work, at least in the e-version, is that the introduction of the authors comes after the stories, when the \u2018teaser\u2019 description of the story and how it relates to their greater works should have come prior to each tale. A minor quibble, but one worth mentioning. Anthologies are always a mixed bag, and some stories grab you more than others. That is inevitable with such a wide assortment of writing styles, authors, and story types, and such was the case here. I didn\u2019t dislike any of the stories, but a few stood out and will remain with me for quite some time. The aforementioned author\u2019s tales fall into that group, as well as stories by Paul Mannering, Tim Marquiz, Frank Tayell, and Jacqueline Druga. Their stories made the leap from the page into my imagine more so than any of the others. Of course, anyone who enjoys a good zompoc tale will likely find a good primer for a larger series of books by various authors to check out-with traditional slow moving zombies as well as infected and fast moving, talking zombies being found within these pages. And while some of these stories weren\u2019t as compelling as standalones, they did intrigue me enough to perhaps take a closer look at the bigger stories being told. With future volumes having specific themes, it is more than likely that the stories will be standalone tales of horror rather than shorts tied into a larger saga as was the case here. This is a solid start to a promising anthology series with the proceeds going to a very worthy cause."}], "description": "When evil overflows from the deepest, fiery pits, the battle will be At Hell\u2019s Gates\u2026Whether you are a zombie aficionado, or you feed on horror, there is something for everyone.
