I was very entertained by it and practically finished it in one sitting. It very much reminded me of Twilight, in a good way, just better and about werewolves. It\u2019s definitely one of those series that I would have obsessed over in my young teen years. What I can say about this book is that it was fun but very cliche. You have the special snowflake girl who finds herself in the middle of a paranormal war. And for some reason everyone wants her because she soOooOooo special. She\u2019s like the one. She does clueless stupid things but whatever who cares, she\u2019s special remember.Then you have the totally brooding guy with super secretive secrets. Add a dash of supernatural and a large sprinkle of possessiveness and you got yourself the special snowflakes love interest. And they totes fall eternally in love and would do anything to save the other. Then there\u2019s this war I was talking about. One side is good and the other is obviously bad. You know this because they look scarier. And both sides want to take this snowflake from the other. Bang. Boom. That\u2019s the book. Was it the best thing I ever read? No.Did I enjoy reading it? Heck yeah.Am I going to continue the series? Eventually."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10480068-christine", "userReview": "I am a sucker for YA paranormal books. Whether they be vampires, werewolves, fairies, you name it, I will read it. This book did nothing for me. I just didn't buy the whole romance between Isaac and Adria. Didn't buy the love for sisters. When I thought it would get good, it didn't. I tried. Spoiler below.Not sure how to hide a spoiler correctly so pressed ENTER a bunch of times.The paragraph below only tells a small part of what happened in the story, but is a part that annoyed me enough to be turned off.Spoiler ParagraphWhen Isaac came to apologize to Adria after she caught him in bed with another girl. Isaac sent someone to get Adria so he could talk to her, but when Adria said she did not feel like talking to him, instead of Isaac trying over and over to talk and convince Adria that it really was not what it appeared, Adria went to his house days later to straighten out the situation. WTF!?? Adria are you desperate? When Adria went to Isaac's house and asked him why he sent someone to talk to her and did not come himself after the incident, he said that \"he was respecting her space.\" WHAAAT??? And Adria bought it!? Nah, that does not work for me. Call me old fashioned, but I like when the guy fights for the girl. So after that whenever Isaac said he would never let anything happen to Adria, I did not buy it. Sorry, I did not buy their \"love.\" I read a lot of YA books and I know what Isaac did was childish, but still. Not only that, but I did not feel sad about Alex being in a weird cult, not sure why since I really liked her in the beginning.So there it is in a nut shell."}, {"userName": "Inna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7364369-inna", "userReview": "I loved this book. It's like Twilight's better, older, hotter, distant cousin. This book is awesome for the following reasons..1) The Main Character- Adria was awesome. I don't feel like she suffered from the TSTL syndrome that many YA heroines suffer these days. I feel like even though her life wasn't great she was immensely loyal to her family. I really hated her mom, but I appreciated that Adria didn't become an angst ridden teen angry at the world. Now granted at times she did do some pretty stupid things but i think the flaws in her character were there to make her seem more relatable. 2) The Love Interest- So I have to admit I loved Isaac from like the first moment we are introduced to him. Even though at first he appeared as a bit of a man slut... well okay he appeared as a giant manslut, but I felt that he really was an amazing guy beneath that and I was really happy that i was right. I mean Isaac is very swoon-worthy. He has that right amount of possessiveness and love for Adria that you will love him and anyway the whole Alpha thing is kind of hot.3) The Plot- I feel like many books for YA are overshadowed by teenagers high and hormones. Not to say I dont love romance in m books, I mean i kind of love for the spine chilling totally amazing romance in books but I also want an actual plot. Mayfair Moon had a great plot from Alex and the whole situation with her to Aramei and the situation with her and how she is involved at the end. So I definitely recommend this books to people who love both a good romance read about werewolves as well as a developed plot. I cant wait for the next book because there are just so many answers that I need!!!!!!!

No offense to his fans but I\u2019m kind of feel sorry for him. He\u2019s the most misfortune werewolf I\u2019ve ever read. He seems always in the wrong place meet wrong person in wrong time. And then there\u2019s  Sam Roth,  a sentimental musician werewolf which surprisingly I enjoyed his story. Now, meet Isaac Mayfair , 19 yo werewolf from the most famous bloodline. He\u2019s pureblood, second in line and his Alpha is feared by other werewolves. He met Adria Dawson, female main character in this story, when he has to watch her sister. She is 17 yo human who has to move to Maine, where she met Isaac.Werewolf isn\u2019t my favorite story. That\u2019s why I rarely read it but after my awesome encountered with Redmerski\u2019s book in  The Edge of Never, I kind of promise to her that I\u2019ll read her other books. And I didn\u2019t regret it. Although this book written from Adria\u2019s POV I really enjoyed it. She\u2019s a lovable character. She\u2019s brave yet vulnerable. But not in that kind of whine female character, yes she cry but she also fight hard for her sister. Isaac and his pack are also well described, they have their own story I\u2019m willing to read in the future. I really love the way Redmerski described the werewolf. It\u2019s the werewolf I know for a long time. A werewolf, also known as a lycanthrope (from the Greek \u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2: \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, lykos, \"wolf\", and \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, anthr\u014dpos, \"man\"), is a mythological or folkloric human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or an therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (e.g. via a bite or scratch from another werewolf). This transformation is often associated with the appearance of the full moon. In addition to the natural characteristics inherent to both wolves and humans, werewolves are often attributed strength and speed far beyond those of wolves or men. The werewolf is generally held as a European character, although its lore spread through the world in later times. (Wikipedia)Her werewolves are dangerous tall big kind of beast, it just like  Remus Lupin, . She also took European story to describe it. It reminds me of  Richelle Mead\u2019s Vampire who wrote vampire from Russian story. It\u2019s like I read werewolf story based on original description. All in all, I love this werewolf story and can\u2019t wait to read the sequel. I think I have my favorite werewolf now :DCredit:Jacob Black, Sam Roth and Remus Lupin: www.tumblr.comModel of Isaac Mayfair: www.modelmayhem.com"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4979538-erin", "userReview": "WOW, WOW, WOW!!!! Ms. Redmerski, you clever gal, you went and created one incredibly addicting story, now didn't you??!! I am SO glad I decided to pick up Mayfair Moon, it is one of the best YA fantasy books that I've come across and I am officially hooked on this series!!Mayfair Moon is such a creepy, sexy twist for the werewolf story! This is no \"Teen Wolf\" with a romance; it's a scary, intense, unrelenting tale that grips you with memorable characters, a pulse-racing love, and a captivating plot. Right off the bat, I have to say Adria has wormed her way into my heart big time!! She has all the aspects of a realistic heroine that I love without the \"whoa is me\" or the \"let me be a pushover for the first half of the story\" that I tire of so quickly. Adria is thrust into an unfamiliar, terrifying, deadly world where she has virtually no chance of surviving solo, and she has honest reactions to what's going on around her. She's brave, strong, smart, and clever, and she has a heart of gold that is truly worthy of being loved. And Isaac Mayfair...holy furry, short-tempered beast!!! Yep, he won me over easily with his cocky, bad-boy self in the beginning, and when he starts to show his true feelings for Adria I was a goner!! He was incredibly sexy, and I freely admit that I was fanning myself more than once over his alpha-male irresistibility when it came to any female in his presence!! But he was still so down-to-earth with Adria, devoted to her and determined to keep her safe. I absolutely loved every minute of their budding relationship, from the initial uncertainty and crushing blows to the heart for Adria, to the steamy moments they share as they grow to love each other. I was wholly invested in their romance because I loved these characters so much, so I felt every emotion as they did. The constant threat of danger and the enemy that could spell doom for their relationship kept me on my toes for the entire story, I felt like I was just holding my breath hoping that the end would find Adria with her wolf boy!! Redmerski is such an amazing story-teller, there were so many thrills and chills along the way in this book!! Adria is literally thrown to the wolves when her sister is taken by a rival wolf pack, and Remerski describes the creatures she's created in such eerie detail that you can't help but get knots in your stomach every time Dria's in jeopardy!! The ominous sense of twisted danger that follows the antagonists in this story was truly terrifying, and there's no softening of the blow of the gore and horror that ensues. And there was no shortage of intensity with other aspects of the story, either. There were a few scenes where, as she was going in and out of consciousness, Adria had these beautiful, almost poetic images and thoughts in her mind. It was like I was in her head with her, experiencing the odd out-of-body dream as she did. I just loved these scenes, it took something simple and created such a poignant moment for the story. I was happy to see that there was no long-winded \"fact-telling\" about the mythology behind the werewolves in this story. I actually loved reading about them and what being with Isaac would mean for Adria, because it was written into the story in a way that doesn't overwhelm the plot and bring it to a screeching halt. Trajan and Aramei, Isaac's father and his wife, have such an incredibly heartbreaking and sad love, and their tale was so the perfect way to have Adria learn about human-were relationships. The supporting characters were just right for the story as well; I adored Zia with her perky, outgoing personality, and Harry who was just an all-around great guy that supports Adria no matter what. And the feel at the Mayfair house was like a huge extended family, even when there was clearly tension (*ahem* that b*tch Rachel!!!), and I just loved their relationships and the banter between them!I loved every bit of this book, it absolutely gets 5 enthusiastic stars from me!! I'm definitely starting on the sequel now!! The threats that loom over these characters that I grew to love are making me brace for some seriously intense moments for the rest of this series, and I can't wait to see what's next for Adria and Isaac!! =)"}, {"userName": "Shelly Crane", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5614044-shelly-crane", "userReview": "LOVED!!!To be honest, it took me a little bit to really get into it. I am not a huge fan of werewolf novels in general, but I wanted to give it a try b\\c I've heard so much about it being a good book. Pretty much as soon as Isaac comes into play I was hooked. Now sadly, I saw a spoiler review for the last book, so I knew exactly what the 'weird stuff' going on in the end of the book was. I kinda wish I hadn't seen the spoiler. I wonder if I would've figured it out for myself. :) But it didn't ruin anything. If anything I cant wait to read what happens in regards to that. I wonder how she'll react. I understand why 'it' was done and I'm wondering how that will play out.Overall, I loved it. It was a page turner that I never felt I could put down easily. Very nicely written. I will be buying a paperback pronto for my bookshelf. I recommend to readers who love them some hot but sweet guys. And adventure. And suspense.

Not only did J.A. Redmerski\u2019s first novel, The Mayfair Moon satisfy my requirements, it went well beyond what I would have expected from a first-in-a-series novel. To be completely frank, I had a hard time putting this book down!Redmerski opens her novel with Adria and Alex, two sisters from Athens, Georgia who, despite their awful home life have always managed to support one another and remain optimistic about their respective futures. That is, until the night the girls find themselves caught up in a violent and terrifying attack that leaves them reeling, battered, and bruised. Enter Social Services. Alex and Adria are removed from their home and re-located to Maine into the home of their uncle and his new wife. For Alex, the move marks the end of her life as she knows it. For Adria, the move becomes a sort of second-chance, a way for her to live in a safe environment, finish school, make new friends, and even snag herself a totally delectable boyfriend in the form of Isaac Mayfair. Unfortunately for the girls, the trouble they thought they left behind has followed them across the country and what happens next in the girl\u2019s lives is where all the fun begins . . .Adria quickly overshadows Alex as the novel\u2019s primary character; Adria is a tough girl with a fighter\u2019s sprit. Despite all the drama and trauma she has experienced, Adria doesn\u2019t let her circumstances define her, she accepts and soldier\u2019s on. Adria is by far the strongest of the novel\u2019s characters but she doesn\u2019t do all the heavy lifting. Adria is surrounded by a cast of minor characters who not only support her but provide insight into the series\u2019 future. Of note among the cast of minor character\u2019s is Adria\u2019s delightful and fiercely loyal best friend Harry and the mysterious Zia who lives with, among many, many others, Isaac Mayfair. Redmerski has done what a good author should do; she has created a myriad of characters that are intriguing, solid, believable, and appropriate to the overall plot line. Every character in this novel knows their place and fills it well while still leaving room for growth as the series itself grows.The Mayfair Moon is a steady read with the major plot line unfolding at a comfortable pace for the reader. Redmerski has a ton of ground to cover in this novel and does so expertly. She establishes both short- and long-term plot lines; ties up the appropriate loose ends for this installment; introduces and develops a large cast of characters; keeps the reader entertained with quick and often witty dialogue; and adds in an absolutely appropriate amount of action and romance. There is a little bit of everything to be found in this novel and never a dull moment. The writing style is smooth and easy to read and the plot line is one that will appeal to adults and young adults alike.The bottom line: I am very much looking forward to the next installment of the Praverian Chronicles; I want to know what happens to these characters and how their lives are going to change. I do however have one reservation and would be remiss if I failed to mention it: this series has the potential to become overly angsty (Morganville Vampires, anyone?). The angst trap can easily be avoided as long as Redmerski keeps her characters moving forward and not wallowing in the past."}, {"userName": "Tana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4733628-tana", "userReview": "The Mayfair Moon (The Darkwoods Trilogy) by J.A. RedmerskiThe Mayfair Moon written by J.A. Redmerski is a fantastic read; the author has done a terrific job giving us a different type of story around werewolves. I absolutely loved the fresh spin in this genre. I found the authors writing refreshing, and I can say without a doubt that this trilogy is going to be a great one. I have given the author and The Mayfair Moon a 5 star rating as her writing is great, plot and character description are done extremely well and I never once put this book down. J.A. Redmerski is definitely one of my new favorite authors.We are introduced to Adria and Alex, sisters living with their mother and alcoholic/abusive stepfather. Adria and Alex are different in many ways Adria more the quite type and Alex more outgoing but always make sure her sister is safe and happy. One evening on their way home they come across a two werewolves fighting in the woods and end up right in the middle of things, barely making it out of the woods alive they return home battered and bruised but alive. Adria knows her sister took the brunt of the attack trying to protect her from being hurt. Adria cannot believe what she saw and knows deep down that she can tell no one as they may think she is crazy. The neighbours sees the sister\u2019s banged up and call in Child Protective Services believing the stepfather has hurt them. Next thing you know Adria and Alex are being sent away to live with their Aunt and Uncle in Maine.Things change for the sister\u2019s in Maine, Alex is no longer the same person, seems cold and withdrawn, while Adria finds herself rather happy living in a home where it\u2019s safe and feels for the first time in her life that her aunt and uncle truly care about them. Adria cannot figure out what is going on with her sister, she stays locked in her room she is horrible to her aunt and uncle who are only trying to provide the girls with a good home. One evening Adria follows her sister Alex through the woods and see\u2019s Alex meet up with some young men, Adria doesn\u2019t understand what is going on with Alex, and to make matters worse Alex doesn\u2019t return home and finds out Alex is living with the Vargas brothers.Adria makes some new friends herself and for the first time in her life she knows she is pretty happy besides all the drama her sister is causing. Getting to know her friends she meets Issac Mayfair who she is instantly attracted too and cannot for the life of her figure out the Mayfair\u2019s family situation. Her friends take her out one evening so she can see her sister and find out what is going on with Alex. Adria realizes at this point that there is something definitely going on with her sister and way more then she can fathom. It appears that the Vargas and Mayfair\u2019s have some kind of family feud going on and Alex and Adria are now in the middle of it.This novel is a fantastic read, I cannot say anymore as I would have to add spoiler alerts, but I will promise anyone who loves paranormal mystery/romance novels this is a number one read. I will recommend this book to all of my friends and anyone who reads my reviews should absolutely go purchase The Mayfair Moon.http://www.amazon.com/Mayfair-Moon-Da...http://jessicaredmerski.com/"}, {"userName": "Scimone Jackson", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7873263-scimone-jackson", "userReview": "[ She runs out on our sexy hero because he's in the bed with Rachel.

I buy them, I read them, I want to like them, but very rarely do I really enjoy them. Even the popular ones that everyone raves about.Yep, we have a fascinating love hate relationship, werewolf books and I.So for me to say that The Mayfair Moon completely captivated my attention and made it extremely hard for me to get anything else done, because hey, I didn't want to put it down! Is definitely saying something about the writing skills of Redmerski.This book had me turning the pages after, well, after the very first page. I wanted more and yes, I was sucked into Adira's (love that name!) world.I honestly can't even tell you what was so fascinating about this book, it wasn't any one thing, it was just everything. The characters, the plot, the mystery, the action, the romance. I just really enjoyed it all. The writing was excellent and everything flowed together so nicely for me.To be honest I am amazed that not only is this book self published (editing is amazing) but that this is her debut novel as well.I will definitely be picking up the second book in the series because I really can't wait to read it.

Can't wait to jump into book two to find out what happens next with Isaac and Adria. The whole story was quite interesting. The writing style and main character intonation complemented the storyline perfectly. Adria's voice captured her high school teenage persona convincingly and she came across as a sincere level headed teenager who regretfully had been dealt a less than perfect hand by fate but somehow managed to stay strong and make the best of things. I liked the author's views on werewolves and the fact that she didn't over romantize it or try to riddle it with over the top mythical pixie dust. I liked the characters in this first book. The fact that the story wasn't simply focused on the relationship between Adria and Isaac but that family ties and friendships were well developed throughout and played an important role. I felt that the characters were nicely developed on both Adria's and Isaac's sides. I especially enjoyed the fact that the story kept me engaged from start to end. I didn't feel any unnecessary lapses or anything overly rushed. The story held enough mysteries and suspense that weren't unbearably overplayed to the point of exasperation. Hate when stories do that sort of thing! You know the thing. Where a story builds and builds and just keeps adding questions and suspense throughout most of the book to then stockpile every answer and outcome into the last quarter of the book making it feel slow and torturous for three quarters to the point that you want to scream only to have all the answers bombard at you like a rampamt locomotive plowing relentlessly through the last quarter of the book. Not the case here I'm very happy to say. The consistently flowing pace was in fact one of my favorite aspects of this book. It kept me engaged with just enough suspense, character development, relationship and interactions, drama, action, all in perfect amounts and nicely laid out with seamless articulation. Very satisfying read overall. Will most definitely be jumping into book two of this well woven tale."}, {"userName": "Nitzan Schwarz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8122395-nitzan-schwarz", "userReview": "[Leif (another name I didn't make up) is not human (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Lee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5829964-jennifer-lee", "userReview": "Actual Rating if you are sickenly obsessed with Superntural like me is 3.5 starsIf you don't like Supernatural then the rating is 3.And if you don't like Supernatural, then this is all I have to say to you:\nSo the reason this book got an extra half a star rating is because of the mention of Supernatural. Yes, I'm giving it half a star beacuse it mentions a TV show that I love. DON'T JUDGE ME!Also I'd like to say that I squealed like a little girl when this came in the mail. It was my first goodreads giveaway win, and it was signed by the author which also made me super giddy and happy. So first I want to thank J.A. Redmerski for providing me with a copy.Now that I've got all the fangirlism and squealing out of the way, it's time to review this bad boy.So the premise of novel is about a girl named Adria and her sister Alex. They have a pretty shitty home life, with a drunk abuse step dad and a mom that seems, for lack of a better description, weak. The mom is more the child then they are, so the two sisters have sort of taken it upon themselves to take care of her. One day while walking home from the park, the girls happen upon 2 werevolves fighting, and they get kicked around a bit. So, because of the bruises and stuff, the social services thinks it was the step dad's doing and takes the girls and send them to live with their uncle in Maine.At this point the story really picks up. Her sister starts acting wierd and hanging out with the wrong crowd, and really, just being a bitch. I really liked the relationship between Adria and Alex, even though we didn't get to see too much of it before it went sour. I was genuingly sad for Adria when her sister turned for the worst, they seemed really close.I can say that right now, I loooooved the fact that there was no unneccessary love triangles. I can't vouche for the rest of the series, but as it is now, their doesn't seem to be another love interest on the horizon. It also took me a long time (longer then it was suppose to I'm sure) to figure out what the Mayfair family was. As soon as it was said I was like \"DDEEEEERRRRPPP\". It was completely obvious, but apparently I was dropped on my head when I was a kid.The only things I didn't particularly like are:1. Adria. I liked her to an extent, but I usually go for MC's that can survive, kick ass, shoot guns, and wield badass swords. She wasn't neccessarily weak, and she was definitely no Bella, but I couldn't see her winning a fight. She was sassy though, and I liked that.2. Isaac. Don't get me wrong, he's one hot tamale (did I really just say that? -hangs head in shame-) but there was a lot of that \"I'm too dangerous\", \"we shouldn't be together\", \"I might lose control\" thing going on. I don't particularly like it when the love interest doing things like that, reminds me too much of Twilight. He didn't really stop her from doing things, like a controlling douche, so that earned some respect from me, but he did stalk her in a not so stalker way, so I'm not too sure how I feel about it.But all in all, it was a fun read, I really enjoyed the storym and I found that it was hard to stop reading. I will definitely be picking up the sequel, and I'm looking forward too it. This was my first werewolf book I've read and I might actually read some more. If you like werewolves or paranormal books, then this is something you will like, so pick it up and give it a read. I want to point out one more awesome thing about this book: They are REAL werewolves, not men that turn into wolves, but men that turn into werewolves. They are nasty and I loved it!I was provided a copy by the author and goodreads for reviwing."}, {"userName": "Val \u2693\ufe0f Shameless \u2693\ufe0f Steamy Reads", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11626803-val-shameless-steamy-reads", "userReview": "I just had to DNF this book. And I just have to rant about it. I'm sorry, I love YA romance and I can suspend certain beliefs for the betterment of the reading experience...but these characters were just ridiculous. Isaac and Adria's love at first sight is completely without chemistry and based on...absolutely nothing. At least in a similarly ridiculous book like Twilight--even though the fact their love was also based on virtually nothing--you could actually believe it a little bit. I mean, at least Bella's blood smelled like wicked awesome vampire ambrosia to Edward and she was the only person ever whose thoughts Edward couldn't read - So as leastleast you felt like the characters actually had a tie - even if it was small. There was SOME chemistry. ***You KNOW things are bad when I am using TWILIGHT as a point of defense.*** In this book, they have barely even had a conversation - they are not even friends let alone anything close to dating, and Adria acts all huffy and betrayed after finding Isaac half dressed and making out with another female shifter. Um, first of all, Adria, you have no earthly reason to be upset. You aren't married, dating, and haven't really spoken more than a few words to each other EVER so your response is asinine. But if we play a long and say Adria did have a reason to be upset? YUCK. He was half-naked and rounding second base with someone other than you - despite supposedly having feelings for you? This is what we adults call a red flag. And sure, he explains this incident later, during a melodramatic apology in which he forces the female shifter to tell Adria there is nothing going on. WTF??? They tell Adria he was \"sick and messed up on drugs\" and that the female shifter took advantage of him. But later in the story, when he admits to being a werewolf, he explains to her that they can't get sick......So...wait...I thought he couldn't get sick...so then he willingly messed around with the other girl? Who knows. Cause Isaac never clarifies and Adria (who was so supposedly torn up over it) never even asks! After that, we find out Isaac and his \"family\" are originally from Siberia (seriously? *head bang*) and engaged in this 200+ year war against another were-clan. And the patriarch of the family (Isaac's dad) is going to be going back there with the rest of the family. All BUT Isaac. Because he is just so in love with Adria that he can't leave. So you are telling me that he is ABANDONING his family and his clan during their time of need for a chick he barely knows? I'm sorry, but I just don't respect that at all.At this point, I gave up. I understand the whole power of instant love and attraction and it driving you to do things, but since I didn't feel any connection or relationship between Isaac and Adria, I just couldn't fathom him giving up his family for this 3 week relationship. Also, between that and the inconsistencies, I was just done. I guess I've just reached the point where I think why finish reading this drivel where there is so much other good stuff out there."}, {"userName": "Sarah Kalaitzidis", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5834247-sarah-kalaitzidis", "userReview": "I\u2019m not usually surprised by werewolf books, but this managed to do just that. In most of the werewolf books I read, they turn into a wolf. In this book, the werewolves turn into Lycans, or half man-half beast. I don\u2019t usually read werewolf books like this, but this book made me love it from beginning to end. There is so much character diversity, but they all fit and work well together. Adria is the main character of this book. She was close to her sister Alex, back when they lived in Athens, Georgia. Alex acted like a more like a mom then their real mom, and taught Adria things like how to drive stick in a car. She even tried to get Adria to date boys she picked out, but Adria wasn\u2019t into dating. They were sisters and looked a lot a like, but Adria always wondered why boys liked her sister more. After a incident that caused the sisters to move away to Maine, things changed between them. Adria learned to deal with the incident and even tried to put it behind her. She went to a new school and managed to make her friends right away. All of Adria\u2019s friends are different. Harry is the normal person of the bunch. He likes to skateboard, and is actually quite good at it. He is also Adria\u2019s first real friend. They could talk about anything, and she loves to spend time with him. He has a crush on Zia, someone who Adria met back at school for a brief moment. Only later did they became friends, when Zia picked Adria up from the highway after crashing her bike. (Read to find out why she crashed!) Zia is a great fun person, who really cares for Adria. Zia also loves to try and get Adria and Isaac together, even when it doesn\u2019t work at first. You also meet people who live with Zia and Isaac, some of whom don\u2019t really like Adria because of how Isaac feels about her. Isaac is very quite when Adria first meets him. He doesn\u2019t speak a lot, but you know that everyone listens to him. It's to the extent that even people who'd rather not listen to him can't help but do so. He\u2019s a really good guy, but trouble seems to follow him and Adria. I don\u2019t think he gave Adria (or the reader) a good first impression about him, but he's a character that draws people to him.The romance in this book was slow, just the way I like it. It took time for the two characters to learn to trust each other and to start liking each other. The attraction was instant, but them becoming a couple and loving each other took time. They did have some bumps along the road like jealous girls who also want Isaac, not to mention that while she is human he is something completely different. Though nothing broke them apart from loving each other all the way to to end of the book. The plot line of this story is what drew me into this type of werewolf book. It was written very well, and character development was also well done. I loved every moment of it. It comes with a twist you didn\u2019t think possible, and it will leave you wanting to read the second book all the more.

J.A. Redmerski, why oh why did it take me this long to read it? I absolutely love this book and the characters in it. I seriously played out every scene in the book like it was an actual movie shot. Yes, it's a story about werewolves, but it's so much more different and very unique, than your average werewolf story. It's eerily dark, cloaked in so much mystery and heart palpating twists and turns. The wolves are actually huge, as in, totally morphed and vividly reminiscent of the Lycans in the Underworld movie franchise. But, what is most outstanding amongst the story and the characters, is the descriptive and in-depth visuals you get when reading everything from how Adria, the female protagonist is feeling or thinking, to the transformations and grotesque images of flesh being ripped apart, and other hauntingly vile scenes. Redmerski is such an amazing writer and it's most evident she has thoroughly researched everything to get every detail right and perfect. Love, love, love it. The Mayfair moon is so creepy and deliciously sensual, and sexy, and wild. It had me screaming RAWR at every turn. From the beginning I was captivated and catapulted into this world that has been at war for hundreds of years, and like Adria, we are swept away, or more like, thrown head first into it unknowingly. I'm not about to go into too much detail about the story, as I truly think that it's best if you all pick it up for yourself to find out. Instead, I'm going to try and explain the feeling you get while reading it. Picture yourself, shadowed within the darkness, fear eclipsing every nerve, heart is racing, adrenaline is peaked, and then you are consumed with a fire that burns through you, terror enveloping you. The instinct to run away overtakes you, but then, you draw on your strength and confront the beast. Your heart is overwhelmed with love, you think you are going to burst and it encompasses you, making you stronger than what you ever thought yourself to be. No fear, or terror, or evil can sway you otherwise. That's how I felt while I read this story of Adria and her Isaac. He's such a sexy beast, like literally RAWR!! He's so primal and dominant, yet so endearing and kind and tender. I love him! Adria is every way his equal and more. She is so strong, and fierce, and determined, and so courageous, she is a total kick ass heroine. She really holds her own against such a alpha driven group. Very refreshing indeed. Okay, I think I've overdone it again, when it comes to trying to convince you all why you should pick this book up. I'm telling you that you will not be disappointed, and you will wonder why you ever waited so long to, just like I did. I'm so glad that I don't have to wait to pick up book 2, I'm totally starting that ASAP. The Mayfair Moon is a must read and J.A. Redmerski is a fantabulous writer. I absolutely love this book and I hope you all too."}, {"userName": "Soumi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6833452-soumi", "userReview": "Alex and Adria, the two sisters have always strongly bonded from their childhood, even domestic violence could not affect them; they always found support and comfort in each other. A bloodcurdling encounter with a werewolf and being attacked caused the sisters to move in small town of Hallowell to live with their uncle. Adria considered this as her second chance to forget the violent incident of werewolf attack and start over her life and met a mysterious young man named Isaac Mayfair who has his own secrets and cause to protect Adria, even from her own sister Alex who seems more drawn to dark sides and mixed up with a vicious cult. The past she left buried seems to uncover as residents come down with an unexplainable \u2018illness\u2019 and some disappear, Adria found herself into middle of a century old werewolf enmity. It contains all of the drama and romance, but also possesses urgency as secrets are kept and tensions rise. The centuries old rivalry between two werewolf cults, mesmerizing action blending beautifully with teen romance kept me hooked into pages. The book has some wonderful characters and Adria as a strong voice of narration. The book starts off with two sisters Alex and Adria , as the book progressed Adria\u2019s character easily eclipsed Alex. Adria has good fighting sprite, she embraced the danger and fought it bravely.I was thrilled to be in the werewolf world and I was immediately thrust into it. The author painted her lead male Isaac Mayfair as true alpha, so mysterious, charming and powerful. He deeply cared about both his pack and the girl he loves. The author included several other great characters making significant contributions to this story, for example Harry who was best friend to Adria, and I find him loyal and caring although there was no best friend \u2013 boyfriend drama, Zia who was also fiercely devoted to her pack as well as a big support to Adria. Though it has romantic elements, The Mayfair Moon wasn\u2019t just focused on Adria and Isaac and their relationship, we were introduced to a secretive world of werewolves and legendary Mayfair family.The author revealed secretive information one by one in exact time and all of them were well throughout the book and necessary, that will force you to flip through pages. The book possesses such easy yet beautiful writing style and polished story line; I don\u2019t remember having any dull moments. The details and descriptions are always so vivid, and the plot in this was also fantastic, especially the last hundred and so pages.I really do want to read the next installment of The Darkwoods Trilogy. As the final battles strike, there more things at stake, Adria has to choose her own fate and I want to miss where the story take us. Highly recommended for all paranormal romance lovers."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20801127-nicole", "userReview": "Now I'm starting to get cranky. It seems as though it's been a week of 3 star books for me and I'm over it. I don't think a book has ever managed to piss me off within the first 2 pages like this one did. Kudos. On the first page, Adria, or \"Dria\" talks about her life with her older sister, her mom, and her mom's abusive boyfriend. She says \"But don't get the wrong idea; no one beat me, and my life wasn't all that bad, really.\" Hmm. OK. If you say so, girl. She also goes on to say, \"Who could be scared of a weasley-looking man with nine-inch nose hairs and who could barely lift an economy-sized box of cat litter by himself?\" Alright. So I'm thinking the man's harmless right? Wrong. Dria THEN says, \"The only thing I could give him credit for was that it took more than sarcasm to get him to hit her.\" Wait a minute, what? What about the weasley-looking man you were just talking about? And did you not just tell me that your life wasn't all that bad?? Your mom's boyfriend hits her and your life isn't ALL THAT BAD ? Also, \"Despite Alex's black eye record, she was the most caring and nonviolent person I knew.\" I don't know about you, but someone who has a knack for punching people in the face seems pretty violent to me.Despite all these contradictions, I continued with the book, really excited because I'm a total sucker for \"clan\" types of books. I was hoping for something along the lines of Shelly Crane's Significant series, where the main guy comes from a big loving family that you jut wish would adopt you. But not so much. Maybe it gets better in the rest of the series? I'm not sure I'll be sticking around to find out.  Most people are right when they say, it doesn't get interesting until Isaac comes into the picture. He's all big, bad and werewolfy, and there are some instances that are total swoon worthy, but much to my dismay, their relationship lacked a bit. And again, it was a little rushed. I would have liked for Isaac to pursue Dria a little more."}, {"userName": "Purcheria", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3762821-purcheria", "userReview": "Ordinarily I try to find books about at least 17 to 18 yr olds because I like to have a bit of spice in my books. It does not have to have all out sex, but at 17 and 18 you're expecting a little more than kissing without tongue. Something a little more mature, you know? This was one of the reasons why I picked up this book along with the fact that it was also about weres/shapeshifters, which I prefer to vampires. I will admit that although I wasn't crazy about the writing I kept at it until I got about 68% in and could not take it anymore. Truthfully, it wasn't really the writing that finally did me in (because I have read far worse than that). What got me was the \"Twilight-ish\" aspect that reared it's ugly head. Although there were no vamps in this one, the storyline started SCREAMING Twilight to me, and in the end it was all i could do not to keep comparing it to or thinking about Twilight.Here's the plot in a nutshell: New girl moves into new neighborhood (although the circumstances are different), girl falls for GORGEOUS dude with attitude (why do most YA leading men have to be drop dead gorgeous?! Out of three brothers, he is - of course -the best looking), he tries to keep her away at first but all of a sudden he is completely head over heels in love with her (and vice-versa, of course) and he would do anything to protect her, and of course he is dangerous to himself and others, he's scared he's gonna hurt her, but oh! She trusts him with her life. She believes in her heart of hearts that he would NEVER hurt her. Umm...Sorry, but I gave up then. I'd had enough. Add to that the fact the romance (in my opinion anyway) was completely unbelievable. It was as if it came out of left field really. I didn't understand how or when they fell in love. Then there are the stupid decisions that the heroine makes...If someone tells you to call when your sis comes home because she's dangerous, what should you do? CALL!!

And it brought werewolves to me in a new aspect. JA Redmerski\u2019s wolves are big, I mean, huge. They are snarly big mean looking monsters.First thing I noticed about this book is that it read very easily. It felt like I was talking with an old friend, and I really liked that. I didn\u2019t feel like I was being told a story, so much as I was there for it.Adria and Alex are sisters living in Georgia with their mother and her boyfriend. Life isn\u2019t perfect, its downright abusive on some levels. But Adria isn\u2019t old enough to get out, and Alex is staying for her sister. On top of that, Adria feels like she needs to stay for her mother. Then one night while they are out walking they witness something terrifying and crazy, and they are attacked. It gave me the creeps, and I loved it! After that, life is not the same. And CPS steps in to remove Adria; they send her north to Maine to live with family. Alex follows because that\u2019s her sister, and they stick together. But Alex hasn\u2019t recovered to the same extent that Adria has. She\u2019s quiet and withdrawn, and just\u2026different.Adria is quick to make friends in Hallowell, Maine, and I loved them! Ok, not all, but Harry. Harry is a fantastic friend, the kind of friend that everyone should have at some time in their life. He is honest and brave, and loyal to the core. I loved Harry, and I would love to see more of him in the future!I have to admit, when Adria met the \u201cbad guys\u201d I was a bit excited. Tattooed, tall, badass\u2026. Lifted trucks. I mean seriously, they were my dream guys. Well, except for the whole bad part. But even that was a bit exciting. But in dealing with them we learn a bit about Adria, and I thought that was fantastic. Adria might be young, but she isn\u2019t some child. She is older than her years, and I just thought her whole personality was really something beautiful.In fact, the whole cast was fascinating. They were colorful and vibrant, and each new character (and there were many!) brought a whole new facet to the story. But its time. It\u2019s time for the namesake of this book, Isaac Mayfair.Isaac is an enigmatic young man, who lives with just a ton of people. There is instant chemistry between Adria and Isaac. The first time they lay eyes on eachother you know there is something there.  \u201cI think I had been in love with Isaac Mayfair all along, but now was the moment in time in which I knew it.\u201dIsaac and Adria are so obviously made for each other. I love each of them separately, but together they are absolutely wonderful. Sweet kisses and long embraces, that feeling that you are loved, wanted, needed\u2026 that\u2019s the gift of Isaac. But just why is he such a she-wolf magnet?? Geez, I just wanted him to push them all off of him! It was making me jealous!! Otherwise Isaac is everything you could hope for in a man, a wolf, and a mate. I love him! I think I\u2019ve said that\u2026.This book has a ton of information in it, but you don\u2019t feel like you are just reading facts. JA Redmerski did a superb job of weaving history and facts in with the story. I was super excited to see that the expected publication date is July 20 for the second book in the trilogy. Don\u2019t quote me if that has changed, but either way I believe it is coming up real soon. And I will definitely be on that auto-buy list.So whether you are a fan of Zia, Sebastian, Harry, Nathan, Beverlee, Alex, Adria or Alex\u2026. Or any number of the others, this book has something to offer everyone. There are some fight scenes that are awesome, that really show the brute strength of these wolves. There are elders in this book, and their story is also one to really dig into. Honestly, I just couldn\u2019t have asked for more.

Because that was the main reason i got the book. I wanted to read something a little different than usual.Sooo i have both positive and little negative feedback for this book. To start with the positive, the book takes you in easily. Okay, at the first 1-2 chapters i wanted to give up, but there was something in there telling me \"no..go on!\". And i did. And i was surprised. The mystery about the werewolves and the families are what kept me most. Even though, i knew deep inside me what was going on there were still some doubts that made me crazy and i couldn't give up reading. I was planning to read about 50 pages, the first day and i suddenly i was over 200? So this part was goood!Then we have the characters. Not annoying heroine? Check! No triangle? Check! Awesome boy BFF? Check! Hot guy? Check! Decent family? Check! All the characters, and the relationships between them, feel more real than most YA books out there. Who said, the boy who says hi and is around you at school can't be your best friend, isn't part of a romance triangle? I think that's the thing that i loved most about them.Lastly, we have the story and the werewolves. Yes to werewolves who are not wolfs (but Underworld like), violent and scary. Do not worry, there is not graphic violence in but you get the point, they are not lap dogs but something dangerous. The story is also dark and it gives you a creepy feeling most of the time.Now, on the negative side (which unfortunately made me go 2 stars down). One was the Mayfair family. Don't get me wrong, i love big families with hot guys and interesting story, but it reminded me a lot of the Drake Chronicles (which there is a big vampire family). So whenever, we had scenes at the Mayfairs' i couldn't stop comparing. And secondly, after our girl and boy are together, there is some \"i'm too dangerous for you\", \"i have to be careful around you\", \"you are better without me\" stuff (even some phrases) which reminded me of course of Twilight and anyway i'm not fan of that way of thinking. So there it goes another negative thing - for me always. Of course this happens, on the smallest part of the book but still...And lastly, i didn't like that after some point Adria forgets entirely her new BFF (Harry) and keeps him out of the loop. They are together later again, but i felt a little weird about it.So despite those things above, i can't say i didn't enjoy it. As i said, i was reading like crazy and that says something.

I need to figure out my thoughts review to come. Some thoughts so far:Why do Isaac and Adria love each other? What is the draw? Is there a reason? I didn't really understand their \"love\" it was insta but it was never clarified why. Mates? Fated mate? He just knew and they love each other quickly.The other things such as werewolves is dark. I'm not sure I fully understand the magnitude of this world. I didn't understand her sister I didn't understand the \"enemy\" what was this war because of? Jealousy? Envy? Wasn't really explained.The cast of characters was starting out interesting. But then took a sharp left turn into wtfs-ville. I mean seriously Julie was a cool character and seemed to be a good friend but something changed. Why? Nothing is explained well and we only know what the MC knows and that's not much. I have more questions than answers. I felt some of Adria's reactions to be off as well and some of her teenager-ness to be meh at best. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting when I read the synopsis of this book. But I feel like it's made my slump more, this wasn't really an uplifting book. I didn't get warm fuzzies. I didn't feel the epic love. BUT early on I totally thought I wasn't going to continue with this series. However now that I have finished I want to know all the answers. Why do Botha sides want her what's the deal yo?! So I more than likely want to finish this trilogy since it is in fact only a trilogy. I think I can stick it out. I know this author is known for her reveals and in hoping it'll be worth it in the end. Maybe things will get explained better I dunno. But I'm willing to try.Ah yes and I was constantly reminded of a twilight feel without all the twilight. Some parts for both Isaac and Adria were much like Bella and Edward.

There's an instant attraction on both sides, and from the way things were playing out, and some comments that were made by Isaac's family members, I felt we were heading towards an imprinting or bonding, which would have been fine with me, but when that turned out not to be the case, the romance just didn't work for me then. They're feeling were just too intense too quickly for my liking. Thankfully though, there were other points of interest which managed to hold my attention to this book.Something happened at the end of this book and I think I know what it is, I'm just not sure who did it? I'm really interested in seeing how that will play out, because no matter who did it, it's not really a good thing. I think there'll be hell to pay, especially from reading the blurb of book 2.
