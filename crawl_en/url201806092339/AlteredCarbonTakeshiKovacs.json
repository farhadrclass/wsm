But I've got a to-read stack longer than my arm, and my reading time is rather precious. It's a big risk to try a longish book by an author I've never read before. In a nutshell. I loved it. About halfway through the book I looked it up online and saw that it won a bunch of awards. It deserves them. I don't read as much Sci-fi as I used to, but I'm no newbie. The world is unique and fresh. Good characters. Interesting mystery. Yeah. Good stuff.

If you\u2019re a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. It's pitch-black dark, brutally ultra-violent and fun as hell. I particularly loved the concept of \u201csleeving\u201d and the method by which characters undergo interstellar travel. This is a cold, difficult reality in which Kovacs exists, and it feels lived-in, with a lot of backstory beneath the surface. I\u2019m hoping that backstory is explored later in the series, because it\u2019s seriously intriguing. The pacing feels a little slow around the 80% mark, but that could just be a symptom of how fast paced it is everywhere else. There's also a chapter near the end that feels almost entirely superfluous. Personally, I think the book would've been better without its inclusion. This book also contains the most unintentionally hilarious sex scene I\u2019ve ever read. Ever. You\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about when you get to it. It\u2019s.. interesting. The novel has a fairly complicated plot that comes together almost flawlessly in the end. I could see this being even better on the second read. I'll definitely be reading the rest of this series."}, {"userName": "Emily (Books with Emily Fox)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox", "userReview": "I haven't DNFed a book in a while but I just can't seem to get into this one...I read 120 pages in a week and was starting to be in a slump so I'm not continuing (at least for now).

It's the best way for me to gather my thoughts.3 to 3.5 starsI liked the book, but I didn't love it. I had been hoping to like it much more than I did. My wife and I are reading it at the same time with plans to follow it up with the Netflix show. After reading, I may not be rushing into watching it.Positives- Very unique and creative. While it does have some shades of other dark/gritty sci-fi I have read or seen, the concepts were fresh and intriguing.- To expand on the last bullet point, there were scenes throughout the book that were very fascinating. The futuristic possibilities, technologies, devices, politics, etc. expanded upon by the author are pretty freaking cool.Negatives- Some may say that this is an intelligent novel that makes you think. For me, it was a confusing novel that made me confused. Every time I thought I knew what happened, there would be some weird shift seemingly out of left field and I was lost again. Often I was not sure where they were or what they were doing. Then, as before I would start to think I knew what was happening and the shift would happen again. Maybe this is appropriate for a book where people keep switching bodies.- I was a theater major in college and had to take a class on naked vs nude in art. Naked being gratuitous and mainly for shock value and nude actually advancing the plot and increasing the artistic value. The sex and violence in this book are very heavy on the naked side. Not that I mind a little gore or some steamy hanky panky, but it was kind of extreme in this book and I am not sure it was truly needed for the plot.- Audiobook - this part is not really a complaint about the book, so I tried my hardest not to include it in my overall impression, but it is hard to separate. The audiobook was not great. The narrator was monotone and whispery. Half the time I could barely hear him. The other half of the time I wondered if he cared all that much. Definitely not at the top of my audiobook suggestions.Neutral- He compares getting your nose broken to biting into a stalk of celery. So there is that . . .Recommended for:- Fans of dark and gritty Sci-fi stories- People who must read the book before watching the series- Lovers of complex, twisty, out-there plotsAvoid if:- You are confused easily- You don't care for gratuitous sex and violence"}, {"userName": "Carol.

His mission: find out who killed Laurens Bancroft, a Meth (short for Methusaleh) billionaire. Bancroft and is offering Kovacs his freedom as a reward. Only a lot of people don't want anyone to know why Bancroft killed himself. Can Kovacs get to the bottom of things before the demons in Bancroft's private life get him?I bought this for a buck and it languished on my shelf for a couple years. Was it worth a buck? Damn right it was!Kovacs' quest takes him through the seedy underworld of the Bay City sex trade, among other places. The supporting cast, namely Ortega, Miriam Bancroft, Kadmin, and Trepp, keep the plot going fairly smoothly. The action is fast and furious and the sci-fi elements enhance the mystery rather than being set pieces. The mystery itself has so many twists and turns that it was hard to keep track. I like when a mystery surprises me this much. Kovacs wouldn't be out of place in any number of crime novels. Bay City is a like a futuristic, and dirtier, San Francisco and is fairly well realized as a setting. It's hard to believe this was Morgan's first novel.\"But, Dan?\" you ask. \"Why only a three? Why not a four or even a five?\" Well, I liked this book but I sure wasn't in love with it. First, the sex scenes were unnecessary and, frankly, kind of repetitive. Let's just say 69 is a popular number in the future. Also, for what the book was, it seemed slow in the middle, like fifty to seventy pages could've have been lost without missing much. The plot zigged and zagged so much I'd nearly forgotten about the Bancrofts by the end. Other than that, I've got no complaints.

The tv show was close to 90% faithful. :) The other bits might be reveals pulled forward from the subsequent books which I haven't read! I honestly don't know. And that's why I'm doing the re-read. :)So did I enjoy it more the second time around? Yep, I did. I really appreciate the whole concept of post-cyberpunk societies running with the technological development and getting established darkly. We're all just meat suits. No one really dies unless you get your implant destroyed or your backups corrupted, but in the meantime, you can get a new meat suit. Or if you have a religious outlook that prevents it, you can't. :) Starting from there, it's a great crime drama, a private PI with a dark past, and enough twists and turns to turn most regular mysteries into cheap trash. :)So do I recommend? Hell ya. :)Original review:Great genre writing, even if it is a perfect mix of noir and post-cyberpunk. I know, I know, cyberpunk is generally associated with noir 50's style tough guy private-eye pulp, only with the shiny.This is different because it is POST-cyberpunk in the great tradition I love to associate with Brin's Kiln People or any of the hard-sci Stross or some of the best of Stephenson. You know, the sci taken to the second or the third steps, and then twisted and here you've got a stock character thrown into this really messed up science fiction world and it all depends on how well the story is written, and yes, oh, yes, it is written very well and is very enjoyable. :)"}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8192509-gavin", "userReview": "Altered Carbon is one of those sci-fi books that lingered on my to-read list for years. It was the arrival of the Netflix TV adaptation that finally gave me the push to pick it up. I'm glad it did as this exceeded my expectations and turned out to be one of the best noir detective stories I've ever read! In a future where the human mind has been digitised and can be downloaded into a new body a criminal, Takeshi Kovacs, is pulled from prison (or cold storage as it is in this futuristic sci-fi world) and offered a catch-22 deal by a powerful businessman. He can solve a murder or return to serve out the rest of his long term prison sentence. The murder is that of the businessman himself! The police have closed the case and ruled it a suicide but Laurens Bancroft, re-sleeved in a new body with no memories of the night he died, does not believe the verdict. Soon Takeshi is caught up trying to solve a murder case that no one seems to want solved except the murder victim! The story was a good one. The mix of mystery and action worked well and the sci-fi setting was cool and interesting. Morgan's writing style was direct but very compelling. The whole story was told in the first person from Takeshi's POV and despite being a bit of an anti-hero he proved easy enough to root for. He was also a fairly charming narrator and his cynical and snarky outlook on life made for plenty of fun moments. This was 100% a sci-fi noir detective story. It was a very good one but did still suffer from an occasional overdose of the genres typical tropes which I did find a little annoying. The worst of them being the vaguely misogynistic tint to the whole story! On the plus side the mystery was a good one and held my interest until the very end. Morgan's sci-fi world was also quite fascinating and it was packed with a ton of cool futuristic sci-fi technology. The story also had a bit of depth to it. Morgan did not linger too long on any single issue but he touched on a whole bunch of interesting topics that are perhaps even more relevant today than they were when Altered Carbon was written. All in all I enjoyed Altered Carbon a lot and rate it as one of the better sci-fi books I've read in the last few years and possibly the best sci-fi I've read with a noir detective theme. It had a few flaws for sure but on the whole they did not really hurt my enjoyment of the story. Rating: 5 stars. I was thinking about just going with 4.5 stars due to the tropey nature of some of the happenings but I'm just giving it the whole 5 stars since it was so addictive and fun to read! Audio Note: I think Todd McLaren did a good job with the audio. His general narration was good and he seemed a good fit for both the story and Takeshi as a character. He was not without flaws though as while he dealt well with the male voices he did struggle quite a bit with the female ones."}, {"userName": "Milda Page Runner", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18708315-milda-page-runner", "userReview": "Less humorous, darker and deeper than I expected - nevertheless I absolutely loved this book.

It\u2019s no wonder Richard K. Morgan became such a phenomenon in the science fiction world so quickly. His first novel, \u201cAltered Carbon\u201d is so well crafted that it bears no hints of being a first novel. His imagination and story telling is absolutely amazing. Although it is absolutely full of graphic violence and has a few X-rated sex scenes, every part is so well written, it all fits. This book should have completely offended me. I can\u2019t stand gratuitous sex and violence. But, the way Morgan writes it, the sex and violence come off as being necessary to the story and the characters. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever run across such plausible characters and actions. The plot is a standard noir detective thriller, but it\u2019s so well done that the mystery remains a mystery until the very end. One thing Morgan handles very well is his technology. He really goes into the various implications of a transhuman world where people can upload their thoughts, memories and personalities to different bodies (sleeves), depending on their ability to afford the costs. The truly rich can afford to live for hundreds of years, switching to young versions of themselves when their bodies get too old for their tastes. Poor people just get the consciousnesses (known as stacks) stored until someone is will to pay the price to get them reactivated in a new sleeve. The quality of one\u2019s sleeve is an indication of their wealth. Without ever going into lecture mode, Morgan shows us how nearly every aspect of this transhuman society works.To keep my conscience clear, I will state very strongly that this is at least R-rated material. A few scenes are X-rated. Some readers may be very turn-off by the brutality of \u201cAltered Carbon.\u201d It's also quite difficult to follow, with a lot of twists and turns in the plot. More than a few times, I found myself wondering where a certain character came from or how we found ourselves in a certain scene. If you can handle the violence, sex and complicated plot, it is an excellent read and well worth the time and effort."}, {"userName": "Kathy Ahn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/403441-kathy-ahn", "userReview": "Hmmm...I can't remember why I picked up this book. I think I read about it on a friend's blog. I read most of it today and finished it off. But it was sort of painful at times -- the last 50 pages were sort of agony to read, but by that point, you just have to finish the damn thing.Not spectacularly written, but hardly unusual for a book in this genre. It was interesting enough for me to plod through it, and at one point I enjoyed it briefly, but I thought it was full of logical flaws and jumps and not very original. The idea of \"sleeving\" into new bodies is interesting. The idea of \"consciousness\" or whatever you want to call it being nothing more than data you can download is interesting, but neither is an original idea.I particularly disliked that discussion he has with himself about his father -- completely out of context and forced into the narrative. The discovery of Sheryl Bostock felt forced and came out of the blue, too.I finished the book with a sort of relieved sense that it was over and don't have much good to say about it. There was nothing unique about it. And you could've ignored its inelegance if there'd been a sense of joy and wonder in reading the book, but I didn't feel that. I don't think the narrative was cohesive and the only thing that keeps you going is that you want to know how all the details of the plot -- even if it's a poorly rigged one.However, it did get me thinking about interesting things -- about how much of who we are is the biochemical and neurological wiring of our physical selves and what it'd be like to separate that body from our stored memories. What happens to a person when their stored memories are downloaded into a different physical body? How does the new \"self\" react to someone else's neurological mappings? I think I'll probably be mulling over ideas out of that book for a while.

Morgan goes out of his way to tackle compelling notions about life and morality at the intersection of technology. He asks about the nature of what makes us human. He challenges the idea that memory and experience solely define us. The pages are practically bursting with genre favorites like Cyborgs, gun-play, hovering vehicles, and bionically enhanced assassins. Assassins, who by the way, can be needle-cast from colonized world to colonized world in an instant. An army of souls sleeved in flesh they\u2019ve never worn to keep the peace, using some sort of tactile telepathy to recognize whose side they're on. That sounds cool as hell. I want to know more about all of those grand notions, don't you? Then, why is the story itself set on earth? Earth is clearly a relic world, a shithole careening through space while humanity flourishes among the stars - I wanted to adore this book so much!But, wishing it doesn\u2019t make it so, this book still sucks!Written in the first person, which is usually a turn off for me, Morgan is quick to exhibit exactly why I'm not a fan of this narrative style. From the unlikable inner longings of the main character to the sex scenes that are more awkward and uncomfortable than lurid. Imagine having your mother overshare the details of your conception - it's like that. If this unfortunate pressing of the flesh happened only once in the story, I might have been able to overlook it\u2026It didn\u2019t, so neither will I.Morgan jumps from profoundly cool concepts to silly tough guy posturing, but these scenes are equally poor in their execution. The main character is a stereotypical hard man, cussing and throwing his weight around, but it\u2019s mostly caricature. Takeshi Kovachs comes off like a terrified High Schooler trying to be hardcore: content to simply fake it and hope no one takes notice, bullying his way from scene to scene with little more than the inertia of intent.Passable for a private dick in our distant past, but really, really stupid, for an intergalactic god stompingly badass member of the Envoy Corps in the distant future.There is a whole lot of intrigue in this book, and I still can\u2019t put my finger on what it is all for. Everyone is reprehensibly dirty and beyond pity or affection; their sole purpose is to serve as set dressing to prop up interesting ideas that are not integral to the narrative. Characters run round and round while their supporting cast - who are way cooler and decidedly more kick-ass than Kovachs ever got the chance to be - drop like flies. And, in case I have undersold my dislike, here, let me spell it out for you: This was a book that was as hard for me to get through as it was for me to like, and it had cyborgs!"}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "I am half way into this and I think I am just going to stop before I get any more annoyed by it. This is, IMO, a rare case when a TV show is MUCH better than the book. Even though the show is full of nudity and violence, on the whole, it is a more progressive story than this novel, at least it takes care to treat its female characters as people (albeit people who get naked a lot). Altered Carbon, published in 2002, feels incredibly dated and is the kind of man-written book I just don't care to read anymore. The narrator is too much dick-driven (literally and figuratively), women he encounters are defined by the size and shape of their breasts, there is that icky sexualized violence against women that seems gratuitous and unnecessary. (I was especially irked when Kovacz was tortured in virtual reality and for some reason he was in a woman\u2019s body, I guess so that he could describe the breasts and be hurt in that special way.

With a little effort, it can fail to see even the most glaring injustice.\u201d \u2015 Richard K. Morgan, Altered Carbon\nIt takes something special for a book to keep me burning through the pages until 3 a.m. Altered Carbon by Richard K. Morgan is a helluva read.\nWinner of the Philip K. Dick Award for Best Novel, 2003Morgan is a wicked blend of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson. There is even a touch of Gene Roddenberry's various Star Trek series. But the beneficent Federation is replaced by a universe governed by the United Nations, a tough bunch, whose prime directive is to do what it takes to get what you want or think you need.Our protagonist/anti-hero--your choice, pushed to the forefront of the story is Takeshi Kovacs, raised off-world on Harlan's World, a colonized by the Japanese and East Europeans. Introduced to violence at a young age through gang participation, Kovacs is a natural for military service. And he is natural to become a U.N. Envoy, the best, and the most brutal in carrying out the U.N. \"Protectorate's\" directives.Set five hundred ,and counting, years in the future, science has mastered the art of defying the principle of you only go around this life once. No. You can grab all the gusto you'd like, time after time, through the development of Digital Human Forms called sleeves. Even the mind can be digitized and backed up in case something untoward occurs to your current self. The wealthier you are, the more of your selves you can keep in storage. Theoretically if you've got the money and the power, you could live forever. Those that choose to do so are called \"Meths\" by the younger and poorer citizens of Earth and the other off-world colonies.Now your first thought might be, why this is no dystopia. This is utopia!But there are a few problems with that. Imagine being married to the same person for three hundred years, and having all the money it takes to support the theory that variety is the spice of life. The preceding statement does not reflect the views or opinions of the reviewer. My wife reads these things. Got it? Enter Laurens Bancroft and his lovely wife Miriam. To say that they have become a bit jaded is more than a bit of understatement. Bancroft enjoys slumming in the myriad sex clubs available, from the lowest to the most exclusive. Miriam enjoys her own t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates, but prefers much more tasteful surroundings.Bancroft is murdered, so he says, upon being re-sleeved in one of his copies. The Bay City Police Department rules it a suicide. Members of the department have little or no sympathy for Meths. They have better things to worry about.Consider this. Morgan writes:\n\u201cYou live that long, things start happening to you. You get too impressed with yourself. Ends up, you think you\u2019re God. Suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well, they don\u2019t really matter anymore. You\u2019ve seen whole societies rise and fall, and you start to feel you\u2019re standing outside it all, and none of it really matters to you. And maybe you\u2019ll start snuffing those little people, just like picking daisies, if they get under your feet.\u201d\n So it is that Bancroft hires Kovacs to investigate his murder. As he tells Kovacs, \"If I had wanted to commit suicide I wouldn't be standing here talking to you.\" Maybe so. Maybe no.Not only do denizens of Morgan's world routinely resort to the F-Bomb in conversation, they enjoy engaging in the actual activity. Morgan includes enough gratuitous sex scenes to appeal to most prurient interests. Of course Miriam Bancroft seduces Kovacs not only through her perfect body but by the secretion of a sexually enhancing chemical from every pore of her body. Erectile dysfunction is NOT a problem in Morgan's world. Nor do Miriam and Kovacs end up in separate bath tubs. I've never understood that Cialis commercial anyway. Have you?\nOf course, Miriam would like to see Kovacs close the case, making her a prime suspect. But Morgan supplies us with a host of other likely suspects, whom I will not reveal for fear of disclosing too much of the plot.Let's just say this re-sleeving business is a huge money maker, along with virtual and actual prostitution a lucrative concern as well. There is little justice for those without money or power.Morgan intriguingly plots his novel around the question of when does science cross the line of morality and religion. Not every citizen wants to be re-sleeved, particularly those of the Catholic faith who see multiple lives as keeping them from the opportunity of ever getting to Heaven.At the heart of this twining and twisting plot is the question of Resolution No. 653, to be decided by the U.N. Protectorate. Can one opt out of being kept digitally stored and re-sleeved?Catholics have taken to having themselves tattooed with the equivalent of a do not resuscitate code. That proposition makes them likely targets for murder, especially when it comes to snuffing an unwilling prostitute.Winner of the 2003 Philip K. Dick Award for Best Novel, Altered Carbon is an addictive page turner which should engage the lover of not only hard-boiled detective novels, but cyberpunk as well. If it's not on your to read shelf, add it.Now, just one thing about this Methuselah business...it would be nice to read forever."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "This book is legendary among cyberpunk fans, I do not really count myself among them as I have read too little from this sub-genre to qualify. However, it is very frequently recommended in the excellent PrintSF forum I frequent. A few years ago I went through a phase of reading crime fiction almost exclusively because I felt like a change from decades of reading sf/f. One of the best practitioners of crime fiction is Michael Connelly, whose most famous creation is detective Harry Bosch. If Mr. Connelly had put Detective Bosch in space (and cyberspace) he may have ended up with something like Altered Carbon (if he is lucky).Altered Carbon takes place in a universe where human personalities can be digitized and transfer to different bodies (called sleeves), artificial or natural but unoccupied. Takeshi Kovacs' consciousness was in storage when he suddenly finds himself in a stranger's body and tasked with solving a mystery for a millionaire whose life was recently restored from backup after he has apparently committed suicide. His backed up consciousness has no memory of this alleged suicide because it occurs after the backup was made and he insists that he is not the suicidal type.The story is not difficult to get into due to its linear timeline and a single first-person narrative. It took me a while to warm up to the protagonist Kovacs because like most fictional hard-boiled detectives he is a pain in the nether regions until you get to know him. The other characters are interesting enough without leaving much of an impression, one exception being an AI character named after a legendary guitar hero. Richard K. Morgan's prose seems more American than English, which surprised me a bit given that he is British, but the style goes with the noir territory I suppose. The prose style is in the tradition of Raymond chandler / Dashiell Hammett. Visceral and lean with the occasional surprising passages of contemplative and even lyrical narration. The nature of \"the self\" and reality is thoughtfully ruminated upon. I have read several reviews that mentioned that this book would make a great action film, one review even describes it as a Schwarzenegger film. This may well be the case if they cut out all the thoughtful elements and just concentrate on blowing shit up real good. I wonder how pleased the author would feel with that?I would rate this novel at 4.6 stars, it does not quite reach the emotional core for me (though it is not far off), it falls just a little short in the poignancy department. Still, it is a fantastic sf book with plenty of food for thought and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone in search of an excellent sci-fi read. Notes: \u2022 This book makes me question the \"immortality by cloning\" sf trope. The idea is understandable but somehow does not jibe with me. There is an interesting discussion of the idea here.\u2022 I just realized that I have not touched upon how virtual reality is cleverly used in the book as an interrogation tool, now I don't know where to discreetly fit it into the review!\u2022 Update Jan 23, 2016: Netflix has picked up a 10-episode series based on Altered Carbon.\u2022 Update Dec 5, 2017:\n Trailer for Netflix's Altered Carbon, airing Feb 2018."}, {"userName": "Geek Furioso", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34073355-geek-furioso", "userReview": "He tenido Carbono Modificado cogiendo polvo en mis estanter\u00edas casi seis meses y a\u00fan con todo, decid\u00ed que mi primera toma de contacto con Takeshi Kovacs fuese en la serie de Netflix. Fue un grave error.Con esto no quiero decir que la serie de Netflix creada por Laeta Kalogridis sea mala, ni mucho menos, pero es un producto muy distinto de la novela de Richard Morgan. Carbono Modificado, el libro, es una historia llena de entresijos y detalles, que se toma su propio ritmo para construir el gran misterio que ronda el aparente asesinato de Laurens Bancroft. Es una novela calmada, donde las conversaciones tienen mucha m\u00e1s importancia y peso que los tiroteos y las peleas. El misterio, que es al fin y al cabo para lo que hemos venido, est\u00e1 perfectamente hilado, y Morgan logra esa satisfactoria sensaci\u00f3n de que unamos las piezas al tiempo que Kovacs y que apretemos los dientes, d\u00e1ndonos cuenta de las pistas que estaban all\u00ed todo el rato y no vimos en un primer momento.Carbono Modificado tambi\u00e9n tiene un fuerte mensaje y una parte de ese vitriolo que siente Morgan hacia los ricos y poderosos, al cual dio rienda suelta en Leyes de Mercado. No obstante, mientras Leyes de Mercado era una visi\u00f3n de un capitalismo brutalizado e inmisericorde, Carbono Modificado habla de la ruptura de l\u00edmites \u00e9ticos y morales de una \u00e9lite que ya no tiene nada que temer, ni siquiera la muerte.

It's dark, bloody, and very deep.This is a mystery novel, basically, set in a very high-tech future where humans are basically downloaded into a hard-copy file, called a stack, from the time they are a year old so that their bodies become \"sleeves\" that are hosting human consciousness. So, if someone's body is killed, their stack can be put inside another body, or the stack can be accessed in virtual reality, or it can even be placed inside of a synthetic body- like an android type of thing. Seems like a cool idea, yeah?With my luck, this would be the only robot body I would be able to afford:\"Who put the fucking banana peels on the floor again? It wasn't funny yesterday, and it isn't funny today!\"The problem is somewhat reasonable. There are two basic laws in life that you can count on:1. People aren't meant to live forever.2. The rich will always find a way to fuck-over the poor.Yeah, so the rich can afford to house clones of themselves with back-up cloud service on their stacks so that they have an endless supply of themselves available. Great. Just what we need, an endless supply of rich assholes. And, of course, since they live forever, they get bored, and what the hell, they might as well kill people for sport. I mean, they can always buy that person a new body after they get a sick thrill from killing the old one. So, hey, don't be a baby! Let the rich man pay to torture, rape, and kill you. He'll totally replace you.\n\u201cYou live that long, things start happening to you. You get too impressed with yourself. Ends up, you think you\u2019re God. Suddenly the little people, thirty, maybe forty years old, well, they don\u2019t really matter anymore. You\u2019ve seen whole societies rise and fall, and you start to feel you\u2019re standing outside it all, and none of it really matters to you. And maybe you\u2019ll start snuffing those little people, just like picking daisies, if they get under your feet.\u201d \nSo, our hero, Takeshi, is a type of soldier-ish, and he is sleeved onto Earth to help a rich dude try and figure out who tried to kill him. There are plenty of people who would want to, I mean, he's a rich asshole. But, it is almost impossible to accomplish this task. There also are a lot of people who are trying to kill Takeshi, and we aren't sure why. He's not rich at all. Still, the guy gets tortured, maimed, and beat up throughout the book. It gets pretty brutal during the torture stuff. I had to skim a bit.This book had all of the amazing future-stuff that I love, including those flying cars that I always talk about. I know you all are sick of me whining about wanting one before I die. My goal is to die IN a flying car. I refuse to die until I can go out that way.Close enough.There are a lot of heady ideas in the book too, about what makes up a human. Souls and stuff. But, it's combined with enough blood and gore and action that you don't get too philosophical. I would say that you will like this book if you love future sci-fi and gory mystery and maybe a bit of noir. And darkness. This isn't a ride on the happy-train. But, I liked it. I'm getting back on the happy train for my next book, as a palate cleanser, but it was worth it."}, {"userName": "Will", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22334608-will", "userReview": "I hate this book. Hate, hate, hate it. I hate the characters, I hate the plot, I hate the cover, I hate the way it smells, and I hate the way it knocked over a lamp when I frisbeed it across the room in a fit of literary angst. It came to me highly recommended by a number of friends, good friends, caring, kind, and well-read friends who share with me a love of speculative fiction. We all love Snow Crash and Neuromancer and Babylon 5, and we all hate football and direct sunlight. We are all science or engineering majors, and therefore we spent our socially-awkward, bespectacled childhoods sitting in the back of French class, surreptitiously reading The Lord of the Rings under our desks while Monsieur Charpentier tried to teach us the subjunctive mood. What I'm trying to say is that yes, I have a certain amount of nerd cred, and come from a background well-suited to an appreciation of cyberpunk. So when I heard about Altered Carbon, I didn\u2019t hesitate to pick it up.My main problem with this book can be summed up as everything.Seriously, everything. Every single aspect of this book conspired together to instill in me a strange mixture of despair, anger, and boredom. To call the characters one-dimensional would be an insult to the number line. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical. The protagonist, Takeshi Kovacs, is an Envoy, a sort of highly-trained, elite interstellar soldier, and one of the most blitheringly stupid morons I\u2019ve had the displeasure of reading about. New technologies are condensed out of thin air to arbitrarily move the plot along. Every character to whom the reader is supposed to be sympathetic is either an unlikable asshole, an idiot, or both.Choose two: Incompetent, unlikable, clich\u00e9. Bam, you\u2019ve described a character in Altered Carbon.And then there\u2019s the violence. Now, I thoroughly enjoyed The Repossession Mambo (renamed Repo Men after the movie came out), a book so blood-soaked that it\u2019s practically a biohazard. Somehow, Morgan has managed to craft a work of prose so exquisitely brutish that it made me uncomfortable. That\u2019s actually kind of impressive. Good job.Morgan also seems to have a fascination with the word \u201cenzyme.\u201d It gets a little weird.At the end of the day, I ended up putting this book down six-sevenths of the way through because I found out there was a sequel, dashing my hopes that Kovacs would permanently die in a horrible way on the last page. By around the halfway point, I was literally reading Altered Carbon out of pure spite. I hate this book, I hate Richard Morgan, and I hate you. Not because you deserve it -- you are probably a perfectly fine human being, or a reasonable facsimile thereof -- but because any time I think about Altered Carbon I am unable to experience any emotion but unending, bitter, sobbing hatred. I read (most of) Altered Carbon and came out the other side a changed man, and not for the better. Please, for the love of all that you hold dear, don\u2019t read this book. And if you do, don\u2019t tell me that you enjoyed it or I might just vomit all over you and/or punch you in the solar plexus before you have a chance to say \u201cpostmodern.\u201dNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I am going to hug a cat and watch a Pixar movie. If that doesn\u2019t cheer me up, I\u2019ll probably be forced to check out every copy of Altered Carbon from a library, light them on fire, throw the ashes into a river, and listen to Smile Empty Soul songs until I can\u2019t feel emotions anymore."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "With my sinus allergies kicking my butt, I don't have the energy to write a really long review, so I'll keep it simple. I thought this was an excellent book, though not really a comfortable book. I don't think this book is for everyone. The language is very coarse, to be honest. Liberal use of the worst word for women in written language is employed. It starts with a 'c' and ends with a 't', and I think you can fill in the blanks. I winced just about every time. Despite this, and the fact that this story deals with prostitution and horrible abuse of women in a disturbingly intimate manner, I don't feel that Mr. Morgan showed misogynistic tendencies in his writing. In fact, some of the most strongest, most three-dimensional characters in this story were women, and each one was different. I particularly liked Ortega, and her relationship with Kovacs. Trepp was interesting, as well. Miriam was somewhat standard noir fair. You know, the bodacious vixen who also happens to be the wife of the victim, who seduces the PI? Yeah, that's in this book. This book was fairly violent, although not quite what I'd call gratuitous. Not gratuitous in the sense that the whole book wasn't violent. But, yeah, there are some pretty in your face scenes. Let's just say I would be looking away on quite a few scenes if this was a movie. There's a fair amount of sex, too. I thought it was tasteful and well-written, despite all the nasty inferences to particularly 'icky' sexual practices. That was all off-scene, thankfully.The worldbuilding was very good. The whole concept of sleeving (changing bodies), and stacking (digital storage of consciousness) was a bit disturbing for me. They have figured out the key to immortality in the 25th century, and that immortality is not a pretty one, at least to me. Bascially, if you have enough money, you can have your consciousness continually transferred to different bodies as the old ones wear out, or your present body is prematurely damaged. Let's just hope you do have the dough to spring for a new body. If not, well, I guess you get to hang out in a digital storage bank, for eternity. Yikes. I did like the tech, some aspects that made it clear this was a future setting, but not so much that I got bored. I did have some issues getting used to the vocabulary; but I soon fell into the stream of things.This book gave me some things to think about. My feelings about what gives a person her or his identity. Is the soul what they are storing, or is it merely the consciousness? What happens to the soul? How can you be unique if you can download your consciousness into more than one body at a time? Mr. Morgan doesn't try to answer these questions, so I'm still pondering it, left to draw my own conclusions. In this future world of Earth, the Catholics definitely don't agree with digital storage of consciousness, and they fight it. Unfortunately, that makes Catholics a particular target for people who don't have respect for human life. That was another theme this book touched on. There are some people (powerful ones) who don't seem to value human life; since, well, you can just buy a new body when the old one is not working anymore. And people who are not worth anything in society, they are simply disposable. One of the major bad guys comes right out and says this. It made me think that even today, when we don't get replacement bodies, people have the same attitude. Life isn't sacred, if the person isn't worth anything in the material sense. Kind of sad to see that things haven't changed.Kovacs was a protagonist that had layers. He was a ruthless killer. But, he was also a principled man, who had limits to what he would and wouldn't do. A man who cared about people, capable of loving and being loved. But, also a man who could kill remorselessly and does. He doesn't seem to have an issue with sleeping with another man's wife, but he doesn't like prostitution. Using drugs is not something he's against, either (I hate drugs, so I didn't really care for that). He's in over his head, several times. He gets hurt, badly. So, even though he's clearly a very dangerous man, he's not invulnerable. You really don't know if he'll make it through some of the sticky situations he ends up in. You see this crazy world through his eyes, and it's not pretty. One thing that surprised me, was that the environment wasn't screwed up. I had expected that this would be an issue in the far future. But, not so much. I guess, with all the bad stuff that was going on, why throw in environmental catastrophes?To sum up things: This was a very good read. I'd like to read more stories with Takeshi Kovacs, and more of Mr. Morgan's writing."}, {"userName": "Anton", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20923295-anton", "userReview": "Excellent stuff.

It all went so slowly it was like a video playback on frame advance. The commando kept his aim low, holding the Kalashnikov down against the hyper-rapid-fire recoil it was famous for. The bed went first, erupting into gouts of white goose down and ripped cloth, then Sarah, caught in the storm as she turned. I saw one leg turned to pulp below the knee, and then the body hits, bloody fistfuls of tissue torn out of her pale flanks as she fell through the curtain of fire.I reeled to my feet as the assault rifle stammered to a halt. Sarah had rolled over on her face, as if to hide the damage the shells had done to her, but I saw it all through veils of red anyway. I came out of the corner without conscious thought and the commando was too late to bring the Kalashnikov around. I slammed into him at waist height, blocked the gun, and knocked him back into the kitchen. The barrel of the rifle caught on the doorjamb, and he lost his grip. I heard the weapon clatter to the ground behind me as we hit the kitchen floor. With the speed and strength of the tetrameth, I scrambled astride him, batted aside one flailing arm, and seized his head in both hands. Then I smashed it against the tiles like a coconut.Under the mask, his eyes went suddenly unfocused. I lifted the head again and smashed it down again, feeling the skull give soggily with the impact. I ground down against the crunch, lifted and smashed again. There was a roaring in my ears like the maelstrom, and somewhere I could hear my own voice screaming obscenities. I was going for a fourth or fifth blow when something kicked me between the shoulder blades and splinters jumped magically out of the table leg in front of me. I felt the sting as two of them found homes in my face.For some reason the rage puddled abruptly out of me. I let go of the commando\u2019s head and almost gently and was lifting one puzzled hand to the pain of the splinters in my cheek when I realized I had been shot, and that the bullet must have torn all the way through my chest and into the table leg. I looked down, dumbfounded, and saw the dark red stain inking its way out over my shirt. No doubt about it. An exit hole big enough to take a golf ball.With the realization came the pain. It felt as if someone had run a steel wool pipe cleaner briskly through my chest cavity. Almost thoughtfully, I reached up, found the hole, and plugged it with my two middle fingers. The fingertips scraped over the roughness of torn bone in the wound, and I felt something membranous throb against one of them. The bullet had missed my heart. I grunted and attempted to rise, but the grunt turned into a cough and I tasted blood on my tongue.\u201cDon\u2019t you move, motherfucker.\u201dThe yell came out of a young throat, badly distorted with shock. I hunched forward over my wound and looked back over my shoulder. Behind me in the doorway, a young man in a police uniform had both hands clasped around the pistol he had just shot me with. He was trembling visibly. I coughed again and turned back to the table.The Smith & Wesson was on eye level, gleaming silver, still where I had left it less than two minutes ago. Perhaps it was that, the scant shavings of time had been planed off since Sarah was alive and all was well, that drove me. Less than two minutes ago I could have picked up the gun; I\u2019d even thought about it, so why not now? I gritted my teeth, pressed my fingers harder into the hole in my chest, and staggered upright. Blood spattered warmly against the back of my throat. I braced myself on the edge of the table with my free hand and looked back at the cop. I could feel my lips peeling back from the clenched teeth in something that was more a grin than a grimace.\u201cDon\u2019t make me do it, Kovacs.\u201dI got myself a step closer to the table and leaned against it with my thighs, breath whistling through my teeth and bubbling in my throat. The Smith & Wesson gleamed like fool\u2019s gold on the scarred wood. Out in the Reach power lashed down from an orbital and lit the kitchen in tones of blue. I could hear the maelstrom calling.\u201cI said don\u2019t--\u201dI closed my eyes and clawed the gun off the table.Yes, you read that. The author slowed down time and described bullet trajectories. Fucking awesome is right.While the relationship between movies and books has always been symbiotic, it was never balanced. Action scenes are a purely cinematic contribution, and the results here are spectacular. Paired with a protagonist like Kovacs, what can go wrong?

Joel Kinnaman was simply superb in it. And after watching it, all I could think of was, imagine how good the book is. Because we all know the books are better, right? Well, in this case I think they are on par. Whoever adapted this for the screen is brilliant. I quite enjoyed the changes. I don't know how much they would have annoyed people that loved the book first but I found them at some points better that the book. Takeshi Kovacs is a sci-fi, noir, high tech, more nuanced and tortured version of John McClane (in the first movie), at least that's the feel I got while reading the book. He has the charisma, his own ethics, his struggle for even five seconds of peace, the rage against injustice and murders of innocents along with a big need to avenge. Many times in the book Takeshi goes off topic and reminisces or rambles in his own head which is understandable considering everything he's gone through but makes for some tiring reading. The tv show has it easier as they can simply show you the imagery whereas the book has to describe it to you. The hallucinations and his mind fragmenting, sometimes jumping from topic to serious topic forced me to really concentrate on the pages but sometimes I would just get lost.The plot and world building is complex but seeing the tv show helped shape some of the imagery from the book. In this world people can download their \"soul\", their mind in a stack embedded in the back of their necks. If something happens to their body they can just download themselves in another. If they can afford it. Our antihero is Takeshi Kovacs, taken out of a \"vault\", where your consciousness is stored if you commit a crime or have no body, by a filthy rich man and put to work solving the guys murder. Apparently rich folk can upload remotely and have multiple spare bodies. So no Real Death for them. This book deals with so many layers of society that resonate very loudly in the world of today. The apathetic manipulation and exploitation of the poor by the rich,health care, religion, love, ethics, politics. You name it, it's in there. And it makes very valid points. Both in TV and here in the book. \n\u201cThe personal, as everyone\u2019s so fucking fond of saying, is political. So if some idiot politician, some power player, tries to execute policies that harm you or those you care about, take it personally. Get angry. The Machinery of Justice will not serve you here \u2013 it is slow and cold, and it is theirs, hardware and soft-. Only the little people suffer at the hands of Justice; the creatures of power slide from under it with a wink and a grin. If you want justice, you will have to claw it from them. Make it personal. Do as much damage as you can. Get your message across. That way, you stand a better chance of being taken seriously next time. Of being considered dangerous. And make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people. Players they will make deals with. Little people they liquidate. And time and again they cream your liquidation, your displacement, your torture and brutal execution with the ultimate insult that it\u2019s just business, it\u2019s politics, it\u2019s the way of the world, it\u2019s a tough life and that it\u2019s nothing personal. Well, fuck them. Make it personal.\u201d\nI guess what I'm trying say, probably rather poorly is that in it's bare bones it's an excellent whodunit that's wrapped in a weird sci-fi noir blend, with so many political tones. Takeshi is something between a noir detective and John McClane. Tragically flawed with too many traumatic experiences messing with his head to be a true good guy but trying anyway. I recommend both the TV show and the book to sci-fi enthusiasts. This is one more world to immerse yourself in especially if you love books/movies like Total Recall, Blade Runner and so on."}], "description": "It's the twenty-fifth century, and advances in technology have redefined life itself.
