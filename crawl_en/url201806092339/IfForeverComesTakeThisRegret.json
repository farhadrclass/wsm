AL Jackson writing is simply exquisite!\u00a0I love these characters so much and seeing their story and their love come full circle was an incredible experience.Please note: this is\u00a0not a standalone and should only be read after\u00a0Take This Regret.I will admit though that I started this book with a mix of excitement, anticipation and fear. \u00a0These characters were so dear to my heart\u00a0and I'd seen them get through years of hardship and together build their second chance that I wasn't sure I could handle anything coming between them. But AL. Jackson had never steered me wrong before so I trusted she would give them the ending they deserved... and I dove in.The first chapter gutted me. Everything that Christian and Elizabeth had built together seemed to have fallen apart and I had no idea why. It started off ten months after the ending of Take This Regret and clearly something devastating had happened that was big enough to have driven them away from each other. As Christian said though,\u00a0\"this wasn't about betrayal, not something she or I had caused. This was something that neither of us could control. This was unfair, unjust. This was torture.\"\u00a0So I flipped the pages as fast as I could trying to find out what could possibly have come between them.As with the first book, this one is told in both a mixture of flashbacks and present day story lines, as well as alternating POVs between Christian and Elizabeth, weaving together all the pieces of the story.Seeing how blissfully happy they were together in the earlier flashbacks made me wonder how they could have ever been torn apart. There was never any doubt that Christian and Elizabeth were soul mates. They were completely and utterly in love with each other and even when things got rough and when it was too hard for them to admit it, deep down they were always connected. In this book, they were faced with a gut-wrenching tragedy they had no power to stop and it put the true strength of their love to the ultimate test.\n\n\"Anger and regret...\nPain, prominent and suffocating.\nUnderneath it all was the love that would never let us go.\"\n\nWhile I was reading, the anticipation, the dread, the heart break, the sheer\u00a0longing for things between them to be fixed consumed me. I was furious with Elizabeth because I largely blamed her for how far things had broken between them (not for what had happened of course, but for how she reacted afterwards)\u00a0and while I was also upset a little upset with Christian, I did feel like I understood where he was coming from in this book a lot more. The thing is though that trauma affects us all differently and, in times of extreme pain, few people are rational. Pain blinds us and sometimes we lay blame where it isn't deserved as a way of coping.But what it all came down to, what it had\u00a0always come down to with Christian and Elizabeth was that they both loved each other with all their hearts. There may have been dark spots in their past, months or years stolen away by extreme pain but they had a soul deep connection that nothing could break.Life isn't perfect. Love isn't perfect. But the beauty of Christian and Elizabeth's story was that in the end their love withstood everything and got them through even the darkest of times.At the end of the book, we are treated to two beautifully detailed and very long epilogues that took the time to literally\u00a0show us their happily-ever-after. I can't tell you how much it meant to have this. After everything they'd been through, this was like an affirmation of their love, proving to us that what they'd held onto, what we as the readers had held onto, was real and forever.\n\n\"You belong to me just like I belong to you.\"\n\nAL Jackson's stories are filled with heartbreaking intensity and beautiful passion. Her words speak straight to your heart.\u00a0I love this series, I love these characters, and I love the writing. Here is my casting:4.5 stars**************************** For more of my reviews, book news and updates:\u2726 Main blog: Aestas Book Blog\u2726 Facebook Blog Page\u2726 Twitter"}, {"userName": "A.L.

Having to give birth to the stillborn child is also devastating. I am lucky I never lost a pregnancy or a child that way, but I know people who have. Many people who have. I know people who lost full term pregnancies during childbirth - and only one of those women got even remotely this depressed and she had depression issues before and SOUGHT HELP. That's my problem with Elizabeth. Everyone just allows her to shut down, they enable her behavior and allow her to still show this deep spiral to her young child and nobody tries to make her seek out help. Not one person. And with the way she was acting even before we knew EXACTLY what happened I was giving her some benefit of the doubt because honestly I was expecting it to be worse with how she was acting. I expected Christian to have done something to cause the miscarriage or for her to be unable to have children ever again or both. But no. She has a second trimester miscarriage. It wasn't Christian's fault. It wasn't anyone's fault. It was a terrible thing that happened to THEM. It is something that, although rare and tragic, should not cause a healthy person to shut down for months upon months. And she does shut down. She selfishly thinks that because Christian didn't act the exact same way she did that he somehow didn't love their baby? Honestly aside from him enabling her downward spiral and walking away when she acted like a child, his reactions and grief were almost exactly right. And then she screams that she hates him? Very immature. But he was no saint. I agree with how he himself processed his grief but he should have stayed and made her better and he shouldn't have been allowing her to show this depression to Lizzie. So he's not perfect here by a long shot.

A. L. Jackson has written another gripping book filled with unimaginable heartache and emotional turmoil, like only she can. Picking up after 'Take This Regret', Christian and Elizabeth are set to be married with another child on the way. They seem to be basking in love's bliss, without a problem in the world. Finally, it seems that these two will get their happily ever after.Then, their world is turned upside down in the blink of any eye. On the day that their forever should have began together, it all comes crashing down. Christian and Elizabeth are left devastated, with only anger and the bitter sense of loss. Nothing either of them can do will give them back what they've lost.Turning her feelings of anger and betrayal toward Christian, Elizabeth slips into a deep depression. Harsh words are spoken and their love is put to the ultimate test. Christian is once again living a lonely, desolate life, with Elizabeth and Lizzie just out of reach. He desperately wants to have Elizabeth back in his arms, but fears that she may be lost to him forever.I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that this story was heart wrenching. The characters and storyline are skillfully crafted in Ms. Jackson's trademark style. If you've read other books of hers, then you know what I mean. If not, you owe it to yourself to find out what you've been missing. This story will grip you and tug at your heart from start to finish. It is a story about love, loss, and forgiveness. I can always count on Ms. Jackson when I need a good cry. She'll take you on a journey of strength and healing when all seems lost. I was touched and inspired by Christian and Elizabeth's story. If you enjoyed 'Take This Regret', then you won't want to miss this one. If not, you need to read book 1 first to understand and fully enjoy this one. Another emotional, beautiful story from Ms. Jackson!"}, {"userName": "Farah *Professor Dean's Beauty*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13273769-farah-professor-dean-s-beauty", "userReview": "This is one of my favorite series and even though I didn't love this book as much as the others, doesn't mean that I hated it...Let me explain: Elizabeth and Christian have been through soooooo much in their relationship and finding their way back to each other.Now, you wouldn't be reading this review if you haven't read the previous book so you would know what happened.The love these two share is overwhelming!! When finally they thought they have their chance at their happily ever after- devastation hits and sometimes its the people closest to us that hurt the most.Elizabeth finds herself stuck in a rut where sadness and pain has taken the place of the love and happiness she once felt...And she thinks she is alone...But she isn't... Christian is right there along side her- she just needs to see it...Sometimes when we are in pain we let things go so far to a point of no return, and that's exactly what Elizabeth and Christian did...Only they CAN'T LET GO...Not after everything endured in this beautiful journey...."}, {"userName": "Annette Dellosa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9553560-annette-dellosa", "userReview": "This has been an amazing.. although heartbreaking, but nonetheless, amazing read. My only regret? Thinking I was ready to read such story without a box of tissues on my side. I was literally crying. Not the sob-filled crying type, but the silent-falling-tears crying type. Now let me explain the 4-star rating. I wanted more of the sweet moments between Christian, Elizabeth and Lizzie. To me, those little moments here were overshadowed by a lot of grief. I couldn't get enough of them. I couldn't seem to let them go. --------------------------------------\nChristian and LizzieYES!!! The blurb's finally here.

Jackson tells a story. She is truly a gifted writer. No one can write pain, redemption and happiness with the beauty that she does. This is the third book in the story of Christian and Elizabeth. I was terrified when I saw it listed here on Goodreads. I thought this couple was far off in the sunset with their beautiful daughter Lizzie. Sadly, there was one more tale to tell and this one HURT like hell.I pretty much guarantee that you will indeed CRY during this read because\u2026it\u2019s really sad. Have no fear readers, Christian\u2019s love for Elizabeth never sways and the tragedy that they faced sadly destroys Elizabeth and causes her to pull away from Christian. He is once again sexy, alpha and wonderful. He is definitely in it for the long haul\u2026for forever. The story is told in past and present as well as both Christian and Elizabeth\u2019s povs. Past being recent events that have caused a huge riff between our favorite couple. \n\"I'd been so wrapped up in giving her perfection, I hadn't been prepared to hold her up when devastation hit.\"\nA reader should be prepared to witness the devastating fall of Elizabeth. I just felt terrible for both characters as Christian frantically fights for his family.\n\"People don't always get to love like this, Elizabeth. Not the way we do. It's a gift.\"\nElizabeth was so lost, angry and withdrawn. Her pain felt very real. I cringed during the Logan scenes but thankfully, Elizabeth let\u2019s Christian in and I just loved the sweet ending!\n\u201dI will stand by you forever.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Anna Jackson", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19131682-anna-jackson", "userReview": "2 Frustrating Stars!I was really looking forward to this book, and to the conclusion of these two beautiful characters. I felt that this book was just all to consuming with no light, and I really didn't feel confident in the outcome of these two until I read the epilogue. The entire book, they are grieving, they are hurting, they are spiteful at times, angry, selfish, the list could go on and on. Also, at times I had a really hard time dealing with Elizabeth's emotions or rather trying to justify them in a way that would make me agree with her, and I did to a certain extent. I'm a mother myself, and to have to go through what she and Christian did I truly could not even image, and I would never in my life want to or wish that on anyone. I ached for her and Christian, my heart broke for their loss. Being a parent is the best gift in this world, and for something to happen to a child, is indescribable. Also her attitude was very selfish and at times very irrational towards Christian. Words like \"I cringed,\" \"I wanted to gag when he touched me.\" It was like no one could possibly feel any loss because they were not Elizabeth, unless you were her you had no idea what she was going through. She had no regard for anyone but herself. She minimized everyone's grief but her own. This is a women an adult and for that matter who did nothing to help herself. I mean she completely checked out, and never asked for help, professional or otherwise, she never sought after getting better. Oh wait let me take that back she \"Will Try\", Oh she tried alright, right into another mans arms who she knew all of what two seconds. God forbid she talk to her friends or family or even a damn therapist, I mean gosh how unthinkable. She just pushed everyone away and failed to notice anyone else including her daughter. I mean I can only image how confused that little girl had to be at times. And poor Christian had to bear the brunt of this horrific tragedy. He was made to feel belittled for his loss, because he didn't carry this child or he didn't hold her he must not have cared or loved her. What total bullshit! He was made to feel that everything that happened he should be the one to fix.It takes two to make a relationship work, and two to make it fall apart. Elizabeth made her intentions and her thoughts very clear as did Christian. But, what really did the man do except for make a decision that he knew Elizabeth could not or would not make on her own? So, therefore he should be punished by his loss, and then take away is normal. I mean talk about kicking a man when he is down.How come she didn't have to own her actions? How is it that she didn't have to take any of the responsibility as to why her relationship was on the out? I gave this book a 2 star rating because of Christian, Lizzie & the epilogue. In all honesty if is wasn't for them I would have only given this book 1 star. I wasn't blown away by this book at all actual this book made me mad pretty much throughout. I gave \"Take This Regret\" a 5 stars rating and added it to my favorites, but not this one, but hey you can't win them all I guess. This one was just a big miss for me."}, {"userName": "Alba M.

Que conste que en realidad iba a darle 1 estrella as\u00ed que he sido generosa al final.Esta rese\u00f1a estar\u00e1 a\u00fan m\u00e1s llena de spoilers que la del libro anterior as\u00ed que cuidado con lo que le\u00e9is. No s\u00e9 ni por d\u00f3nde empezar a explicar toda la rabia que me ha producido esta historia. Ha sido muy muy predecible el conflicto que ocurr\u00eda de fondo en este libro pero a\u00fan as\u00ed os voy a contar.Despu\u00e9s de que el libro anterior termina todo s\u00faper feliz con Christian, Elisabeth y Lizzy viajando a Nueva York este libro nos suelta una sinopsis que m\u00e1s bien es una introducci\u00f3n al libro para que la autora empiece la historia donde a ella le salga del mism\u00edsimo potorro. As\u00ed que la sinopsis dice que tiene a Elisabeth con un anillo en el dedo y ya est\u00e1 viviendo con ella y su hija en una casa. Pero en realidad el libro no empieza as\u00ed no, ya empieza muuuucho m\u00e1s adelante. Ya ha quedado claro que esta autora hace lo que le parece sin pensar en lo confusa que puede resultar la lectura. Bueno as\u00ed que hay que entender en este libro, que ya de por s\u00ed es confuso, encima hace cap\u00edtulos intercalados con flashbacks del estilo: cap\u00edtulo 1 el presente contado por Christian, cap\u00edtulo 2 el pasado contado por Elisabeth, cap\u00edtulo 3 el presente contado por Elisabeth, etc etc etc. Vamos que una no se entera de n\u00e1! Pero a la historia venga que me l\u00edo. Bueno empezamos ya la historia con ellos separados, porque como siempre esta autora vive la vida para separarlos. ES QUE NO ME DA UN JODIDO MINUTO DE DESCANSO! No los deja vivir felices no, tiene que vender m\u00e1s libros entonces tiene que armar cosas s\u00faper chungas para separarlos. As\u00ed que estamos aqu\u00ed sintiendo la jodida angustia de Christian que lleva d\u00edas sin ver a su hija, viviendo en otra casa lejos de la mujer que ama. Una mujer que es una sombra de lo que era porque est\u00e1 destruida, ambos est\u00e1n destruidos porque algo horrible sucedi\u00f3. Algo por lo que Christian se echa la culpa, pero que ya os digo desde ahora \u00a1QUE NO LA TIENE! Que quede muy clarito. Pero as\u00ed va el libro, viendo la angustia de Christian, viviendo la depresi\u00f3n de Elisabeth y sufriendo por la tristeza de Lizzy al ver sus padres separados. Pues no sabemos el terrible secreto que sucedi\u00f3 hasta m\u00e1s de la mitad del libro, aunque como he dicho antes es muy predecible. Ah\u00ed va el secreto: Elisabeth se qued\u00f3 embarazada y el mismo d\u00eda que se iba a casar con Christian se encontr\u00f3 mal y cuando fue al hospital se puso de parto, o algo as\u00ed porque no s\u00e9 explica, y la ni\u00f1a naci\u00f3 muerta. Es duro, lo entiendo, pero tambi\u00e9n hay que entender \u00a1QUE ES DURO PARA AMBOS! Algo de lo que Elisabeth se evadi\u00f3 completamente. Ella se aferr\u00f3 durante d\u00edas a su hija muerta y no quer\u00eda dejarla ir. Christian finalmente tuvo que llev\u00e1rsela y ella lo odi\u00f3 por ello \u00a1por eso! No puedo creerme que no entienda que tan duro era para \u00e9l ver a su mujer abrazar durante d\u00edas el cuerpo muerto de su hija. As\u00ed que ella se enfrasca en una espiral de odio y depresi\u00f3n. Se mete en la cama y deja a Christian con todo, con su propio dolor, con el dolor de Elisabeth, con el dolor de toda la familia y tambi\u00e9n cuidando de la hija que ya ten\u00edan; algo de lo que Elisabeth se olvid\u00f3 por completo. As\u00ed que despu\u00e9s de seis semanas en las que Elisabeth se tumb\u00f3 en la cama sin nada m\u00e1s que eso, dormir y nada m\u00e1s, Christian le dijo que era hora de levantarse, de intentar superar el dolor. \u00a1Joder todav\u00eda ten\u00eda una hija que la necesitaba! Y no sab\u00e9is, no sab\u00e9is lo que le dijo. Dios me doli\u00f3 hasta a m\u00ed: le dijo literalmente que \u00e9l no hab\u00eda amado a la ni\u00f1a que muri\u00f3 porque no la hab\u00eda llevado en su vientre, no la hab\u00eda cuidado y sobre todo no la hab\u00eda abrazado. Le dijo que lo odiaba. \u00bf\u00a1Como mierda puedes atreverte a decirle eso a alguien que ha estado cuidando de ti, de tu hija y de s\u00ed mismo y su dolor mientras t\u00fa te tumbabas ah\u00ed y te revolcabas sin preocuparte de los dem\u00e1s!? Pues si se\u00f1ores, y se pas\u00f3 todo el libro diciendo que no pod\u00eda dejar de odiarlo. Incre\u00edble. Y no contentos con eso, se li\u00f3 con el vecino \u00a1con el puto vecino! Cuando sab\u00eda que Christian la amaba y todav\u00eda esperaba que alg\u00fan d\u00eda ella pudiese ver que se hab\u00eda equivocado, que pudiese ver en \u00e9l el mismo sufrimiento por el que ella estaba pasando. Pues no, queridos, de eso nada, ella se mantuvo en sus trece. Pero la autora, que ella sabe c\u00f3mo arruinar un libro como nadie, coge la escena en la que Christian encuentra a Elisabeth bes\u00e1ndose con su vecino una escena en la que los pensamientos de ella no est\u00e1n para nada en Christian y acaba convirti\u00e9ndolo en una escena de reconciliaci\u00f3n entre Christian y Elisabeth. \u00bfQue tan enfermo es eso? En serio \u00bfque mierda pasa con esta mujer? S\u00ed, claro luego se ponen a hablar y ella dice que se equivoc\u00f3 con \u00e9l y blablabla. No te jode, ahora maldita desgraciada, ahora que te liaste con el vecino pero que no se te fue una puta neurona para el padre de tu hija. Realmente no puedo digerir esta historia. Es terrible lo mal que est\u00e1 estructurada, de haber sido mejor compuesta quiz\u00e1 habr\u00eda sido un gran libro final. El ep\u00edlogo hay que reconocerlo es precioso pero el resto del libro es horriblemente penoso. Creo que esta saga es mi mayor arrepentimiento. Una y no m\u00e1s.

Always. There is nothing that could make me stop loving you. Nothing that could make me stop needing you. You are my start and you are my finish, the once who\u2019s going to be there for everything in between.\u201d\nIf Forever Comes is the final book in the Take This Regret Series by A.L. Jackson series. If you have not read A.L. Jackson\u2019s books before you MUST! They are the most emotional, adult romance novels I have ever read. I fell in love with Christian and Elizabeth in Take This Regret and just devoured their romance and their struggle to reunite after many years apart. Christian meets Elizabeth in college and the two fall in love; a deep love. When Elizabeth tells Christian she is pregnant he breaks up with her and Elizabeth leaves college to return home and never speaks to Christian again. As the years pass, Christian regrets leaving Elizabeth and has not been able to love again. Five years go by and Christian sees Elizabeth and their daughter for the first time. He does everything in his power to prove to Elizabeth he still loves her and won\u2019t leave her again. I loved the ending of Take This Regret but was also so excited their story would continue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been you, Christian. Since the moment I realized I was in love with you when I was eighteen, I never stopped. And I promise you, I\u2019m not ever going to.\u201d\nIf Forever Comes is written in a unique format. It starts in the present time with Christian drinking in a bar, hurt and damaged by Elizabeth pushing him away. As the reader we do not know what event happened to cause Elizabeth and Christian to be apart. It is written in alternating perspectives between Christian & Elizabeth as well as past & present from months earlier, switching from chapter to chapter. It is almost like starting the book backwards and we find out what happened between the two near the end.\n\u201cIt\u2019d broken Elizabeth. Cruelly. Savagely. In Turn, she\u2019d shattered me.\u201d\nI love Ms. Jackson\u2019s writing style, her stories are so mature, so real, and so raw and If Forever Comes stayed true to that form. My heart breaks for what these two have to deal with time and time again. They cannot seem to catch a break and just be happy for longer than a day. I was able to predict what was going on by the situations but I think that was the author\u2019s intentions. It was still very hard to read about when the past was retold, brought tears to my eyes because it is so real.\n\u201cStay away from her. Do you understand me? This is my family. Did you see that ring on her finger? Do you think this is a game? That woman belongs to me. She always has and she always will. Don\u2019t think for a second you can take her from me. She will love me until the day she dies.\u201d\n I love Christian; he proves he is still the man who came back for Elizabeth and his daughter. Elizabeth this time around just annoyed me\u2026 she has this man who adores her, who would walk on glass for her and she pushes him away. Her thoughts just drove me insane because I could not understand it. I adored her character in the past but I really was annoyed with her this time around. Their daughter is still adorable! I can\u2019t believe how big she has gotten. As I said in previous reviews, I usually do not care for children\u2019s characters in books but I love Lizzy! She is adorable!As much as I love their story and Christian, If Forever Comes just wasn\u2019t for me. I did not like how the two were apart for so long during the book. I wanted more interaction between them and dialogue. It was a lot of inner thoughts and I needed more from the characters and story. Like I said the writing was phenomenal but the story just didn\u2019t catch me in this time. It just felt like too much for the characters to go through with everything else that has happened. Also the beginning with glimpses of the past was just too much sex\u2026 they were always having sex and I was just reading to get to the real story. It was just too much in a short amount of time. The ending was very sweet and perfect to read. The epilogue/future was a few chapters long and goes years into the future. I felt like I was able to get complete and total closure from Christian and Elizabeth.I give If Forever Comes (Take This Regret #2) 3 Stars."}, {"userName": "Hailey", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10532998-hailey", "userReview": "I do like this author and I absolutely loved Pulled and When We Collide. Sad to say I did not like this. I sulked amazon anxiously waiting it's release only to be greatly disappointed. There is only so much you can make characters go through as a author. Personally I think this is unfair. They already had six years about a hard time getting back together only to have another book full of unnecessary drama. You think with everything that happened to them too grown people with a kid would learn to communicate. See the importance of it. But no the solution as to everything else is to push each other away.Christian - maybe he had some part to play with regards to blame in all that happened, I don't know skimmed through the book so if so then he's an idiot because he allowed it to happen again after all those promises in the first book. Turns out they very empty and useless.Elizabeth - I loathed her in the first book, even though she was justified in feeling what she was, I still hated her. This book - wow - is there a word stronger than hate? She's selfish, she's immature, she says she loves Christian but her actions don't prove that. I wouldn't want her to be my mother that's for sure! I wouldn't want her to love me either with the way her emotions flip flop. I mean I can't even begin to understand what it must be like to lose a child but she didn't miraculously conceive on her own. It was part of the man too so again I think the lack of communication is stupid and uncalled for. I'm sad really, I could have done without seeing this end to things and just made it up in my mind from where the first book ended. This just brings down the whole vibe of the first book and I may need to re-rate that one. I just hates books where grown people that have already been through so much and lost so much time together and should value communication make the same tired mistakes over and over. Same empty promises and empty endearments. Well this book would be a return for me - I guess I get my \u00a33 back.

This is the continuation of Take This Regret as Christian and Elizabeth are trying to move past their breakup and take their next steps to a future together. This is like what happens after the HEA. The first time I read this I liked it but wasn't as drawn into the story as I was Take This Regret. Having reread it (twice) since then, I find myself appreciating their journey a bit more.

This is book 2 of the series and there will be a minor spoiler from the previous book.So, Elizabeth and Christian are together, yay right? If that was only so\u2026There were a lot of elements that I did not like. The ending was the first chapter and the whole book was past and present.I HATED THAT!It begins with Christian and Elizabeth not together anymore. We don\u2019t know why, but they have been apart for a few months now.When I read this, I was thinking to myself, ARE YOU SERIOUS? Okay, whatever, moving on. So there\u2019s flipping back, to happy memories (before all the stuff happened) to present, to not happy memories (after all the stuff that happened).I didn\u2019t care for the flashbacks, because I knew something would happen to cause them to fall apart, so sure, I got some steamy scenes and happy and giggles, but what\u2019s the point? It\u2019s not lasting.THEN we get to the part where we find out what happened and of course, it was obvious, typical and I just couldn\u2019t believe Elizabeth and Christian both acted the way they acted.JUST WORK IT OUT PEOPLE! I could understand if this was the first problem, I felt like Elizabeth and Christian went through so much already, that this conflict was just not needed.Oh and there was a part where I was angry, frustrated, I almost put this as DNF, but the book was so short, I finished it out.There was no point to this book, it was just added conflict, drama and a lot of angst.

It's very weird it disappeared. I really despised this book. I hate when authors mess up the HEA of previous book. I didn't know that going into this book. I would never have touched it if I knew. But then, I was naive and I used to by books based on my liking for the author. It was 3 years ago and I was a believer. Lol. Nowadays I dig as deep as I can to know what's going to happen. I won't waste my money and time in crap books. The ridiculous female mc ( she was nice in the previous book) just became a horrible person here. Selfish, unfair, neglecting. She had a miscarriage but she had a sweet daughter already. She proceeded to neglect her daughter and blame her husband for the ending of their marriage because he didn't want to hold or see the dead baby. Horrible person. Each person grieves on their own way. Anyway, it became a very unpleasant reading. If memory serves me right she even flirted with another man, father of one of her daughter's friend. The hero (because he was) had to fight for the relationship and give her all the time she needed. I would tell her to fuck herself and let her go to hell and drown on her misery. With my help. I have zero patience for pity party and blaming others for things that there's no blame for just for you to look as a victim."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24181495-julie", "userReview": "Oh GOD!Who wouldn't love Christian?!

L. Jackson y continua narrando la historia de Elizabeth y Christian, protagonistas de la saga.Tenia este libro en mi lista de pendientes desde hacia meses, despues de terminar de leer el primer libro, pero luego lei tantas rese\u00f1as que decian lo triste y dramatica que era la historia que decidi aplazar la lectura para otro momento.Al comenzar la lectura me costo un poco engancharme con la trama, sobre todo porque habia pasado tanto tiempo desde que lei el libro anterior que se me habian olvidado muchos detalles de la historia, ademas el libro comienza de una forma \" peculiar \", ya que empieza narrando el \" futuro \" y luego retrocede varios meses para contarnos lo que ocurio y provoco la situacion sobre la que leemos en el primer capitulo.Es un libro que se lee muy rapido, tiene un ritmo muy natural y fluido que no se hace tedioso en ningun momento, aunque reconozco que en algunas ocasiones mientras leia deseaba que el drama acabara y los protagonistas tuvieran su final feliz.Creo que para poder entender por lo que pasa Elizabeth tienes que ser madre y aun no lo he sido por lo que quizas no puedo llegar a comprender la magnitud de perder a un hijo, sobre todo de la forma en la que ella lo pierde, de lo que si estoy segura es que la autora hace un trabajo increible narrandonos el dolor de Elizabeth y Chrstian, quizas me hubiera gustado mas este libro si A. L. Jackson no se hubiera \" ensa\u00f1ado \" tanto con la pareja protagonista, senti que fue demasiado desgarradora la forma en la que se desarrolla todo en este libro, sinceramente esperaba una conclusion a esta serie un poco mas alegre y light, aun asi no me arrepiento de haberla leido porque al fin y al cabo el final de Elizabeth y Christian estuvo a la altura de su historia de amor.3 Estrellas!"}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7074573-maggie", "userReview": "[ This reminded me of Myles  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jackie Lane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1885732-jackie-lane", "userReview": "Let me preface this by saying that I absolutely love all of the A.L. Jackson books that I have read. This one was no exception.I gave this book 4 stars, but it really should be more like 4.5 stars and I hate that there are no 1/2 stars to give out.This series is so emotionally charged and this book was too. I loved how the book changed POVs and went between Past and Present. This book was filled with more angst than the other two books and I really wanted more direct contact and tender moments between the characters.That being said, the writing was beautiful and the story was wonderful. When I picked up the book, I was immediately shocked by the storyline and kind of figured out what was going to happen, but I had to read to find out the details. I think Christian and Elizabeth are two of my favorite characters in a series.***SPOILERS***I was taken in from the start of the story but was trying to figure out how Elizabeth and Christian had drifted so far apart. I loved that it was love lost and then found and now the added component of a marriage and a baby to make the family complete.I definitely felt for Elizabeth throughout the book, but there were definitely times I wanted to smack her and ask her to come out of her \"grieving\" period.Christian was all man throughout the book and did everything he could to make Elizabeth see that he still loved her. The neighbor was \"sleazy\" but I thought the story could have had a little more depth were the fight for Elizabeth was concerned.I was so afraid there would not be a HEA ending for Christian and Elizabeth and was thrilled that there was and that they got the family they wanted.Excellent and enjoyable read by one of my favorite authors that is on my \"MUST READ AS SOON AS HER BOOKS COME OUT\" list."}, {"userName": "Angelina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17969998-angelina", "userReview": "OMG ITS SO AMAZING!! ..

After the emotional upheaval and angst that made up Take This Regret, I thought maybe we'd get a little less of that in the second book. The story is told from dual POV's that are juggled between present day and where Take This Regret left off. While I thought the story was again very well written and made me feel everything, I found myself skimming through the middle. I was so upset with Elizabeth and Christian both. Tragedy again strikes these two and it strikes hard. Rather than together using each other's strength, they break and do just exist alone. When I read book, the strength of the characters, especially the female character is a huge factor in my rating. I want to read about a strong, kick ass female who if she breaks, she breaks and finds a way to put herself back together without shutting everyone out. The last 25% of the book I slowed down a bit because things picked up and I'm very happy with the ending. So there were aspects I liked and aspects that I didn't.

Well this is your book!! I feel like I spent about 90% of it wanting to rip out my own heart because I didn't know how much more of the hurt I could take. There is no good guy vs. bad guy (ok maybe Logan can be considered a bad guy but even he isn't really that bad), it is about a couple who love so hard and then have to deal with loss that rocks them to their very core. Life dealt them a shitty hand, so I guess you could say life was the real bad guy here and now they need to figure out how they can survive this type of pain and loss.
