Alas, my heart was fractured just a tiny little bit.This installment of Morganville has us headed out of town for a crazy and dangerous road trip. The book was full of peril and bizarre happenings as usual, but I have to admit that I prefer our little disfunctional family when they're actually raising hell in their own town.I was happy that it was easy enough for me to come back to this series after a year plus break (I read the first 7 so close together that I overdosed for a while) and be able to pick right up where I left off. Rarely, can I do this with series without having some memory lapse issues. This was not the case and I'm glad for it.Part of me got to thinking as I was reading this book that Claire has really grown up. I almost feel guilty for giving book 1 such a low rating because I hated Claire back when I first read about her. It's easy to see now that the author intended for our lead to transform herself with time and experience, to which she has - in spades. The girl who started out as a mousy pushover is now smart, cunning, sweet, loyal and strong. Claire's growth as a character has been slow, steady and impressive. I should probably reward that by going back and raising my rating on book 1. Maybe I will at some point, but not today. Why do I like the series? Because no one is pining away for the cool kid vampires. Oh no...people are SCARED of the controlling vampires. Oppression kind of sucks for our crew of friends. And in Morganville, you don't get to run far because you'll get caught. In a way, I get why the road trip was a nice little break from being inside of town, but honestly, I never felt stifled by having to stay in Morganville. Half the fun of the series is watching these young adults try to outwit the vampires who watch their every move. Plus, Ms. Caine only adds to the dynamic by adding in some awesome dark humor. I have yet to make it through a book without finding several moments which make me crack a grin.\n\nShe thought of all the times she'd seen Myrnin go off the rails - the times he'd begged her to put him out of his misery. The time he'd actually given her samples of his own brain - in a Tupperware container.\n\nNothing else to say other than this...I'm hard pressed to believe that you can kill a vamp with a pencil. That must be one sturdy pencil. Random comment to the MV fans : I know everyone is a huge Shane fan, but for whatever reason, there is something about Michael's protective nature which makes me like him best right now. Please don't send hate mail, I should be free to love as I choose!"}, {"userName": "Victoria \u2661", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45941923-victoria", "userReview": "Taking computers were my limit.

This one takes us out of Morganville and into the \"real\" world, but perhaps the real world is scarier than Morganville. The road trip is innocent enough, until the group are given a chaperone who insists on stopping in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Cue bad luck and horror movie action.I love the you-can-never-leave-Morganville thing so stepping out of it was new. For about 5 minutes. Then, I began to miss Myrnin's quirkiness, Amelie's smooth self-control, and damn, even Monica's bitchiness. The entire first half of the book was very teen-in-love tongue-in-cheek. Too sickly sweet for me. The real action doesn't start until well in to the book, perhaps this was to give the characters a rest, a well-earned vacation from the upheaval of the last 7 books. But I love that upheaval, the action and the politics, and as a result this felt like a filler book to me. I didn't truly enjoy it until the last 100 pages and then it ended.The ring scene was VERY Buffy & Angel but I can overlook this for the significance of the ring to Shane. He's serious about Claire, and that's what matters, but I'm wondering when their happiness is going to be shattered. Is Myrnin going to make a move on Claire? Is Shane going to become too overbearing and protective? Which brings me to Eve and Michael, is it going to last? I have a feeling Michael may break it off in order for Eve to have normal things like children, which he can't provide.Claire makes progress with her parents; she gets to move back into the Glass House again. Plus, she turns vampire slayer with a crossbow to a stunned Oliver which spawns a hilarious scene ending with Claire promising she won't hurt him!Shane's changed too. In Michael's own words, \"The universe explodes, hell freezes, and Shane does something reasonable.\" In fact, Shane does quite a few reasonable things. He doesn't move first and pick himself off the floor later any more, he's learned to restrain himself in dangerous situations. I'm impressed.***Spoiler***There was one thing I didn't understand: the reason for the diseased rogues. Bishop was clean. He didn't suffer from the vampire virus, which is why his blood helped cure it, so how come he infected the vampires he made?Overall, there were some great lines but this was probably the weakest of the series so far, though I am rubbing my hands together in anticipation of Ghost Town set back in Morganville for more mysteries and conspiracies."}, {"userName": "The Flooze", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/355739-the-flooze", "userReview": "**3.5**Rachel Caine handles suspense quite well. Kiss of Death is no exception, as the residents of Glass House head off on a road trip that includes some unexpected and terrifying detours. There are a few things beginning to bother me about Morganville, however. One is the need for a new story arc. Now that vamp-Alzheimer\u2019s has been cured and the Bishop threat obliterated, Caine has yet to establish another major storyline. As a result, there seems to be a lot of focus on relationship drama, and that\u2019s not as interesting to me. Claire and Shane are adorable, but there\u2019s only so much gooey young love I can stomach. Eve and Michael are irritating. No, strike that. Michael is fine. Eve is irritating. She\u2019s so melodramatic and bratty that I want to strangle her most of the time. I do wish she\u2019d take her mood swings down a notch and find some common sense.That said, this story has harrowing scenes that kept me turning pages. Once again, these four kids find themselves battling to save lives. It\u2019s a wonder they ever manage to survive. To mention what they\u2019re up against would mean giving away spoilers, but there are several plot twists in Kiss of Death to keep the action and suspense rolling along. There are also some exchanges with Oliver that make me wonder if there might be more to the cantankerous caf\u00e9 owner\u2018s personality. Not nearly enough Myrnin, though I suspect he may be the center of a future storyline (which would make me a very happy camper). On the whole, not the best Morganville has to offer, but still an entertaining , strife-filled read."}, {"userName": "Pri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3618681-pri", "userReview": "Oh boy.... I just.... didn\u00b4t quite like it. That\u00b4s what usually happens when you have so much anticipation. But I thought I would like it much more than the previous ones, which I really lovedWell, the whole road trip idea was cool and all, but what annoyed me the most was MUST EVERYTHING HAPPEN WITH EVERYONE EVERYTIME??? That is really annoying, I mean, I know you can\u00b4t have a regular road trip in an action book, but these guys don\u00b4t get any break at all!!! Just like Hermione tells Harry in the HP books: \u00a8It seems everything only happens to you, right, Harry?\u00a8(I don\u00b4t think that\u00b4s the actual quote but you get my point).So, I got these conclusions from the book:1 - I\u00b4m sorry, but Shane has to go. He is now a mere sidekick, with no further development (he is that stereotyped character that only says \u00a8shit!/that\u00b4s bad!/I\u00b4m not doing that!/great idea, man!\u00a8. Besides, never liked him and Claire as a couple. He simply has no future and has nothing more to offer (to her and the series).2 - Eve also gotta go, and soon. God, what an annoying and retarded girl!!!! She has turned from smart and hip best friend to a redneck zero-personality girl (this is back from book 07 already), who never knows when to shut up and only brings the gang trouble because she is so damn self-centered. Besides, she is way too clingy for Michael\u00b4s girlfriend - he is the cool rockster, needs a cool and open-minded girl, which she proves she isn\u00b4t.3 - Oliver is so cool, I wish I knew more about his past and all.4 - I absolutely love Myrnin and I totally think he is completely fallen for Claire - besides, they are the best possible couple, they are both intelligent, always bickering at each other, he is old, powerful, beautiful with the right amount of insecurity.... they would rock together!!!! She is also starting to think about him more than she intended, so I think this is the way the author is heading them. Maybe that\u00b4s why I am so bitchy about this book - there is almost no Myrnin at all.... God I love him!5 - Michael should stop being so bland and robotic, doing only what he is told.... he started the series as a great character with great possibilities and I think he is being left out too much. Maybe Amelie would pair up with him after he kills Eve ***evil smile***6 - I still think Monica and Claire will become the bestest of friends, and I think Monica was like a supervillain at the beggining (which I thought was kinda way too much - I mean, killing people at will!!! A teen! And everybody knows!!!) and now she is showing that there\u00b4s more than evil there.... I like her as a character.In short, the series is still awesome and my favorite - and I know there are always the annoying books in series. This one, together with book 02, are my least favorites so far. But I will continue, waiting for more Myrnin!!!"}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746727-arlene", "userReview": "Wow! What a GREAT sequel!! I did not want this book to end. It was full of action, crazy vamps, snarky dialog, and constant twists and turns. For a portion of the book, I felt like I took a turn into Night of the Living Dead, and I loved every moment of it. INSANE.ABSOLUTELY.INSANE!! In this book, Michael gets a recording deal in Dallas and is granted a leave from Morganville. As part of the agreement he\u2019s made with Amelie, he is able to have Eve, Shane and Claire join him on his road trip. Just when you think they are out of the danger zone when crossing the Morganville city limits, things could not get any worse for the Glass pact. They get caught between a war of vamps and zombie vamps as they stumble into the town of Blacke where Bishop left behind a group of infected vampires that are turning the town upside down. I loved the dialog in this book between the four main characters. Shane gets honorable mention in this installment for his hilariously snarky lines. He was shear perfection in this book. Every single word that came out of his mouth had me squeeing like a fang-girl. LOL I missed some of the Morganville characters, especially Myrnin, but it was nice to see a change in scenery. I was a bit surprised by Eve\u2019s vulnerable side as she lacked a bit of her badass edge, and I found myself missing that part of her. Claire was great and Michael was his perfect self.What a great sequel, with a more subtle cliffhanger than the other books, but it\u2019s not going to ease the pain in having to wait for the next book.

Regardless of that, i still think the plot was weak. Sure, after the first 100 pages things got interesting, but somehow it didn't feel completely right, to me it was a little overdone, like if, getting them out of Morganville to yet another vampire-infested remote town could really refresh things...It is so sad, Morganville Vampires used to be one of the most fun, enjoyable Young-Adult's reads out there, but random adventures don't make a strong storyline, it works for short stories, but on a series, i don't like this sense of going nowhere.I think is a shame when publishers pushes autors for more books, even when stretching things that way ends up hurting (or even killing) the story."}, {"userName": "BBBTerri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1516166-bbbterri", "userReview": "How the heck did I get sucked into the Morganville Vampires??

This past year I read them non-stop, so I read Kiss of Death sparingly until deciding to finish it yesterday. First of all, it was great to see Michael, Eve, Shane, and Claire out of Morganville. After books 6 and 7, it was time to have some happy thoughts. Knowing Rachel Caine, however, I knew it would not last long (and I love her for that). One thing I have to say about the Morganville Vamps series is that it never, ever stops moving. If it's not one thing it's another. I felt this book--for the most part--kept up the pace. Okay here's where the SPOILERS come in.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSKiss of Death continues the theme of breaking down the once-strong town of Morganville. Rachel Caine has created an amazing, interesting society and world of vampires and in these past few books I've been shifting between sad and happy to see it destroyed. Sad because I do enjoy the vampires and want them to lead good lives (only drinking donated blood mind you) and happy because of course I want our main, human characters to break free from the oppression of the vampires. Between Bishop and Morley, the delicate town that Amelie built has slowly fallen apart and we continue to see that in Kiss of Death as Morley and his crew take their leave.One great part about this book is I finally saw Claire really change. When it hit me that she had changed (when she shoots Morley) I also realized that over the course of the series she had been slowly evolving as a character. It was in that moment, though, that it just all fell into place. I think it hit me because she finally stood up for herself, full force. And it was great. Claire is smart, resilient, and resourceful--but now she is also dangerous. One thing I always hated about Claire was that she never seemed to make the first move. She always just reacted when Monica finally made good on her threats, instead of moving first. This time Claire hit first and I'm hoping that we'll see more as the series continues. Kiss of Death was needed in order to remind the readers that the characters we love and want to leave Morganville no longer belong anywhere else. Claire, Eve, Shane, and Michael caused trouble in each town they went to until they were able to actually do good in the town crawling with feral vampires. Even when they finally make it to Dallas, Michael mentions that their trip and happiness is only temporary--and that's the way it has to be. That thought is soon reinforced when Amelie calls to remind the group that Morganville is where they belong, whether they like it or not. This is where my favorite moment of the entire book comes in. This one moment made the book for me. Oliver is one of my favorite characters in the series. He reminds me of Snape from Harry Potter, because I still don't know where he stands. Is he a good guy, but simply realistic? Or is he truly evil? I'm still not sure. What I do know is through the past few books in the series, I have begun to see different sides of Oliver that will hopefully help me find the answer. As Michael, Claire, Shane, and Eve are frozen by Amelie's cruel warnings, Oliver tells them to be ready in the morning and enjoy the rest of the night while it lasts. At the last moment, Oliver turns and quickly says, \"And I am sorry.\" It was so out of character and out of the blue that I was actually taken aback by what I had read. But I loved it! I think that moment showed that if Oliver could somehow prevent Claire and her friends from ever stepping foot in Morganville he would (probably, hopefully) do it. Then again I'm still confused as heck about Oliver's character but I'm going to enjoy this Nice Guy moment while I can. All in all Kiss of Death really surprised me. I thought leaving Morganville behind would mean leaving the action and story behind, as well. I was wrong."}, {"userName": "~Tina~", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2594672-tina", "userReview": "Wow, did I ever miss these guys!!!!Reading a Morganville book is like welcoming home friends you haven't seen in six months, the visits are always to fast and you wish they'd stay forever.So what's going on with our favorite foursome?ROAD TRIP...Morganville style;)...Dallas wants Michael to go and record some of his music and despite the fact that they need to get passes to Morley and his flock, Michael, Eve, Claire and Shane are finally, FINALLY going to be able to leave hells-town and set off to find some adventure and maybe even some fun.

I never feel bored, and this is saying something because after 8 books, I'm still looking forward to the next one. How many series can accomplish that?The best thing in this book (for me) were Claire and Shane. Claire is turning into quite the badass, (stabbing a vamp with a pencil, shooting arrows,...) and I like where her relationship with Shane is going. I didn't like the Claddagh ring, I yelled OH COME ON at my book when I read that. The gesture is very romantic, but that piece of jewelry belongs to only one couple: Buffy & Angel. Michael and Eve...

Considering their track record, they should have known things just couldn't go smoothly. To start off the crazy train trip their least favorite vampire is coming along as a chaperone. When he makes then stop in a one horse town with a order to stay put until he can get back, the gang gets extremely annoyed, and then wind up getting themselves into major trouble. However, that is nothing compared to the trouble and danger they get into when the vampire's agenda is revealed. It may just be the worst situation they have been in yet, and that is really saying something.The four of them really didn't seem to understand just how different things are outside of Morganville. They are used to being tough, and well known in the town, basically near the top of the \"food chain.\" Eve continued right along with her loud attitude. When it got her into trouble Michael of course steps up all \"tough vampire\" to protect her, putting himself and the rest at a major risk. Claire as always is able to keep her wits about her and figures out how to get them out of that first mess, and proceeds to give them a lecture on their behavior. I love how she is described as tiny little non-threatening thing, but she always surprises those who try to stand against her and her friends.While outside of Morganville, the four of them seriously entertain running off and never coming back. As much as they might want to leave the town, I think they are actually better off staying put. Call me crazy, but it might just be safer for them. Morganville changed all of them and they would really have a hard time fitting in on the outside. At least in Morganville they have earned some status that protect them. Besides, they know it is only a recipe for disaster to try and leave as Amelie would do everything she could to hunt them down. At least by staying they will be on her \"good\" side, if you can call it that.The action dialed right back up in this book. The stakes were incredibly high, and I found it amusing to see just how much trouble the four of them could get into outside of Morganville. It kinda follows along with the saying \"You can take the girl out of the city, but you can't take the city out of the girl.\" They are stuck in this life, and I hope to see them starting on the road to acceptance in the next book. I've always been the type of person to try and make the best of things and I think that's what they need to do as well. I'm eager to see how they take this renewed idea of being trapped in the next book.

I love the pink laundry, the softer side of Eve even though its hard to see her insecure and not fully understanding where things stand, not only with Michael but with her newly reformed brother. I did enjoy seeing Michael in his element with the rock star deal, but he seemed more distant in this one and I was afraid that I would lose the caring, protective and cuddly Michael to the hardened vampire persona.  One quote I love though that describes the development of Shane's character and how being in love and living out his protective streak is changing him. (from Michael) \"Huh. The universe explodes, hell freezes over and Shane does something reasonable.\" It just so fits their dynamic perfectly...  What started out and what they hoped would be a nice taste of freedom from Morganville and a good time with friends, of course, couldn't be just that with this group of friends. They found trouble in so many ways. Some of it their escort helped them get into and others they did just fine getting into it all own their own.  There were some steamy moments with Shane and Claire to keep me going. And Myrnin was there for part of it, and I love our crazy vamp. Claire mentioned at one point in time that he was both mad and brilliant, and it battled which would exhibit in any given moment.  The ending was perfect but bittersweet.

Yet Claire and Amelie always surprise us.In this book Claire, Shane, Michael and Eve is granted a pass to leave Morganville for a week, chaperoned by Oliver, to accompany Michael to Dallas to see a potential record deal. It was a very exciting prospect for a road trip, not even Oliver's looming presence can dampen their mood. On their way to Dallas, Oliver announced an unprecedented stop on a small town named Durram where trouble started brewing. They soon found themselves in the middle of another vampire revolt that lead them to Blacke where Bishop left his wake of vampires with infections. It was one heck of a crazy ride.As usually, Caine did not disappoint. I love where this series is going and it is going strong. I miss a whole lot of Myrnin humor on this book and that snarky attitude from Monica but everything else was just perfect. Every sequel gives us a lot of breath taking action and some killer thrill and it always ends with \"I want the next book now!\" reaction. And what about the Claire-Shane romance? its not on the adult level yet but not really one you can call puppy love. It has become more intense on the emotional scale. My friend Tina from GoodReads was right reading a Morganville book is like welcoming back home friends."}, {"userName": "Brooke \u2665booklife4life\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15928872-brooke-booklife4life", "userReview": "[ I highly doubt they would be allowed to go on a road trip.

I think I tend to start my reviews of this series with \"another great entry in the series...\", or something along those lines - and at the risk of sounding repetitive, this is just that. I've noticed that this one has gotten mixed reviews so far, mainly it seems because outside of Morganville, many of the cast and crew have been left behind. But you know what, I think it's just what the series needed. The gang was back together, and danger and hilarity ensued. Suddenly vampires weren't the only things the housemates had to fear - redneck America was also out to get them. ;) Claire continues to grow up and becoming stronger and braver for it. Shane was hilarious, as usual, and played off Eve, Michael and Claire brilliantly. Eve... well, I must admit she's been annoying me for a couple of books now, and she didn't start off well in this one, but I was liking her well enough by the end. There wasn't a whole lot of development for Michael, short for a scene where he glimpsed Eve's future.Basically, I think this was great fun and a much needed detour out of Morganville to bring the housemates back together and prepare us for more adventures with Myrnin, Amelie, Oliver and Monica."}, {"userName": "Adriana", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2824667-adriana", "userReview": "SPOILER!!!!!!Well, this is not the best book of the series, BUT I read it in one day, I couldn't put it down... Little Claire! not so little anymore... she's growing into a very respectable, brave, strong and desirable young woman and Shane totally knows it. Shane on the other hand, is a lot more restrained this time, not losing control over himself as usual, good thing.What really made me sad is Michael :( poor guy, he loves Eve so much, but the fact that he is a vampire and she's not is kind of ruining things for them, he wants her to be happy but he realizes that he can't give her children, or grow old with her, they're just so different now... I can't wait to see what happens with this couple in Ghost Town, hope they stay together <3As for Myrn, I missed him so much in this book, his crazy and dangerous ways... and Oliver, well he was kinda great! I always thought he was great even if he was kind of mean and cold blooded... but this time he really stand out! yei for him! and he really was sorry for the guys when Amelie said they had to go back to Morganville.

Perhaps even Oliver and Myrnin, although he wasn\u2019t in the book as much as I would have liked!If you haven\u2019t read the Morganville Vampire series, you are missing out! They are fun, quick and entertaining reads. Claire is an imperfect, flawed but lovable main character. She never ceases to amaze me. I absolutely devoured this book. Picked it up and didn\u2019t put it down. I don\u2019t want to get into the plot of the book a whole lot since this is book 8, and if you haven\u2019t read the others you should really start at the beginning!I\u2019ll just touch on a few things! As much as I love Claire and the gang remind me that I never want to go on a road-trip with them! I think they do about everything possibly except make it to their destination. Well, I guess they do in the end. It wouldn\u2019t be a true adventure without several near death experiences. Their lives are never dull, I give them that much.I can\u2019t wait to see where Rachel takes us next.

We get a hooray as we finally head out of town! We get a book because there is a lack of Myrnin (anyone who has read my reviews of the other books knows Myrnin always makes an appearance in my reviews in some way, and I\u2019m still not sorry for that).I felt as though there was less action in this one, but that may be because it is all so confined. Rather than being spread out across the entire book at an equal rate it all appears around the same time, which kills the buzz somewhat. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the action is extremely fun but I wanted it to happen throughout the entire book.At the time of reading the book I felt as though it was somewhat of a filler, because of the whole out of town thing, yet things that take place in this one are important for later on in the series so don\u2019t write it off completely."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36817401-carrie", "userReview": "Kiss of Death is the eighth book in the Morganville Vampire series. Claire, Shane, Eve and Michael are granted permission to leave Morganville and take a road trip to Dallas to a recording studio that wants Michael. Of course with anything thing this group takes on it doesn't turn out as planned. Kind of another slower edition of the series. There are some good moments in it but with most of the cast of characters back in Morganville it felt a bit on the dull side. Couldn't help but miss crazy old Myrnin and his kookiness and the couple of characters from the town that did show up weren't my favorites. It also, took a while for any action to occur and then when it did it seemed over in a blink of the eye."}, {"userName": "Nic", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2813423-nic", "userReview": "Wow! This is the 8th installment and I'm still having a fantastic time reading this series.In this book Claire, Shane, Michael and Eve get a pass to go on a road trip but there is a catch, they have to take a certain undead escort. And of course where ever they go trouble is sure to follow. What I love most about this series it has a perfect blend of action, adventure, romance and humor. Claire is such an awesome character and in this book she didn't disappoint. She really kicked some ass! Shane is delicious putting his heart out there for Claire. I love the scence where he says to her \"Your the future, Claire\". And of course I love the witty dialogue between the four main characters. They always manage to crack me up.Love this book.
