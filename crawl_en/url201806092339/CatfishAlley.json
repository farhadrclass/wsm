I couldn\u2019t immediately talk about it, and even now, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not doing justice to this amazing, wonderful story.Set in the mid 2000\u2032s in a fictional Clarksville, Mississippi, Lynne Bryant\u2019s Catfish Alley tells the story of Roxanne Reeves and Grace Clark. Roxanne has clawed her way into her small town social strata, hiding her poor Cajun upbrining. As she\u2019s preparing to lead the annual tour of antebellum homes, a newcomer suggests including prominent places of local African American history in the tour. Roxanne teams with a reluctant Grace Clark, an elderly black woman and lifelong resident of , to learn more of the African American history of the town. Grace and her friends take Roxanne back to the pivotal year of 1931 as they relay their history. As Roxanne learns more about the local history, her own life changes in previously unimaginable ways.At first glance, Catfish Alley will garner comparisons to The Help. But the more accurate comparison, to me, is To Kill A Mockingbird. The book\u2019s examination of race, especially in the context of small southern towns, is painfully honest. Roxanne\u2019s initial reactions to her first real exposure to African American culture are not unlike things I have heard throughout my life. The shameful history of the deep south is unflinchingly revealed here with a storyline interweaving the Klan and lynchings- things that even now people prefer to brush under the rug of history, preferring instead hoop-skirted tours of old plantations.At the same time, the rich culture of the African American community is examined more broadly than in The Help. Not everyone simply works for the whites in town. Catfish Alley has a black doctor. Grace attends a teaching college and teaches for years. Adelle, Grace\u2019s best friend, is a nurse. That being said, the book in no way glosses over the racial struggle that is in many ways still not over. The lives of Grace and the people in her community were marked with discrimination and tragedy.Yet, there\u2019s a pervasive sense of joy with Grace and her community, too. The love between Grace and Adelle and their friend Mattie is almost palpable. Despite the tragedy and sadness in their lives, they choose to see the joy and love in life as well. As she learns more about her new friends, Roxanne discovers what really matters in life, and allows her to fundamentally change her life.In her author\u2019s note, Lynne Bryant remarks that it wasn\u2019t until years after she left Mississippi for graduate school that she realized that \u201cmy whiteness was accompanied by privilege whether I chose to exploit it or not.\u201d I think that is an incredibly honest statement to make, and more than one reader will identify with it.Catfish Alley left me speechless, and I urge you to read it. Now."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "Lynne Bryant\u2019s first novel, Catfish Alley, was a great read in terms of story-line, atmosphere, unique characters, and themes dealing with prejudices in Mississippi, past and present. I thought Rosanne Reeves and Grace Clark were compelling main characters. Their conundrum, how to move past opposing backgrounds and bygone era discrimination \u2013 which still lingers on to a surprising degree - to forge a genuine heartfelt friendship, and ultimately build a more unified cordial city/town in general. I thought many of the supporting characters, along with their background stories, were equally remarkable and plausible; especially \u201cZero;\u201d so affable, motivated, strong \u2013 a young man bent on rising above his circumstances. And then my heart shattered, even though I saw it coming a mile away. Plausibility did, however, begin to wear thin here and there, starting with Del Tanner\u2019s \u2018sudden\u2019 change of heart toward his father\u2019s wicked ways. Perhaps had several months gone by, instead of a couple weeks, it would have felt more genuine and less contrived. I mean, if it were that easy to open the eyes of bigots to the horrific evils of racial prejudice, color discrimination would have been eradicated years ago \u2013 never to be repeated. Then again, Catfish Alley is fiction. Not everything need be spot-on realistic to a fault. Sometimes painting the world the way you wish it would be is the first step in making it so. Perhaps that\u2019s why Bryant chose a happily-ever-after neat and tidy ending. That is, except for Addie\u2019s ethically debased confession. That was a shocker! No unicorns and rainbows there, that\u2019s for sure. The other thing I didn\u2019t quite warm to was each character\u2019s narrative written in first-person voice. That got a bit wearisome, if not confusing at times. It just didn\u2019t work well for me. I sometimes felt like I had twenty characters living in my head all talking at once. Ah, but Like I said in the beginning, in certain terms, it\u2019s a great read. Good story. Worthwhile intent. I simply prefer historically-relevant topics of a serious nature conveyed more realistically \u2013 a personality quirk of mine, I\u2019m sure. And I'm not a fan of overly neat/contrived endings. This being a debut novel though, not too shabby; well worth the read. Three solid recommendable stars. NOTE: There is a brief and discretely written sexual assault scene which may be disturbing for some readers."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2378558-helen", "userReview": "This book was amazing to me because it was totally unexpected. It seems that the past year or so books about the African-American experience is the new wave in fiction. So I hesitantly picked up what I thought might be just another variation of the rest that I had seen. How surprised I was!This book is very well-written. There are quite a few characters but each one has a voice and is well-developed. The story alternates between present time and the early 1900's. You may think you know where it is going and how it is going to end. But that is where you are totally surprised. Most authors might be tempted to put everything to right in the end so we can all breathe a sigh of relief. But in this story the end shows progress but still no easy answers.Roxanne Reeves was a woman living with a secret. She craved to be accepted by the socially prominent in Clarksville, Mississippi. To some degree she has been successful. She has a beautiful home, a husband with the proper background and a daughter who was born into society. She is a member of the Junior League and president of the Historical Tour society. But still she walks a precarious line hoping no one will learn her secret.Enter a new member from Connecticut who thinks it would be a good addition to the tour of antebellum homes to have an African-American tour. Roxanne with great hesitation takes on the quest to research the history of the black community in Clarksville. She meets Grace Clark, an elderly retired school teacher who very warily becomes Roxanne's guide to the history of the black community.Soon Roxanne is overwhelmed by how much she does not know. How could she have missed most of it having lived here for so long. Was she just blind to it, deaf? Or did it not matter because it wasn't in her realm of reality?For everything she learns there are many more questions. Roxanne starts to find her comfort zone, a security among these people who allow her into their world and trust her with their secrets. She also finds out who she has become and what she wants to be."}, {"userName": "Hira", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4356644-hira", "userReview": "I began to read \"Catfish Alley\" by Lynne Bryant, thinking it was merely going to be an entertaining book. I did not expect for it to open up rivers of joy and pain inside of me - but that is exactly what this amazing book did. \"Catfish Alley\" chronicles the lives of various Southern women, who are smart, intelligent and pillars of strength in their community. It is quite clear with the way author Bryant writes that she is not only familiar and comfortable with the South, but that these stories come from experience. Taking these Southern characters, the author weaves a tale both beautiful and sad. Roxanne Reeves' life is disintegrating, and she has no friends to reach out to, because she has spent most of her life trying to create a distance between herself and others so that they don't discover her past. When she approaches Miss Grace Clarke, in order to consult with her about a new African-American tour, the last thing she expects is to find an amazing friend who helps her come face-to-face with her own demons. In taking Roxanne Reeves to the different African-American landmarks within the community, Grace sets the wheels in motion to relate the story of African-American's in 1930's Mississippi, that changed the lives of Grace, her friend Adelle, Junior who was the love of her life, and Zero, her brother. As the story unfolds, the reader is shown both the prim and proper ways of the Southern belles in her circle, and the impropriety of some of these same families in the past; especially in regards to racism. The highlight of the book, however, is the way in which these African-American women handle the injustices and difficulties that come their way; especially in regards to dealing with the ignorance, racism, hatred and violence perpetuated towards them by the Whites in their community. Told by many viewpoints, both White and Black, the backbone of this novel is the camaraderie that exists between the characters, despite the hardships they may face together. The various chapters told by various perspectives adds immense depth to the story. Character development is excellent, and the author most certainly knows how to steer the reader into the direction that the story is going towards. This novel, although compared to it, in my opinion may even be better than \"The Help\" by Kathryn Stockett, in some ways. Although, \"The Help\" is supposed to have more humor and has a different theme - the books do have similarities, but are not about the same thing. Either way, this book is most definitely worth a read, and I thoroughly loved it, finishing it within a day!"}, {"userName": "Yasmin", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/687724-yasmin", "userReview": "Although this book was compared to The Help I'm glad it was so much more. Bryant did a good job giving realistic portrayal of black characters, they were three-dimensional and honestly appeared to be concerned about them and how they were portrayed. The only similarities between this book and The Help are they're both written by white authors about black experiences in the South during segregation. I would read another book by Lynne Bryant...not so much by Kathyrn Stockett as I don't think she's well-rounded enough to express the black experience beyond her limited view. Bryant gets kudos for doing research and a actually being concerned regarding how blacks were portrayed in her books...she didn't base her writing on her limited experiences or views...she sought to find out what it really means, feels like to be black in America. I commend her for a job well done."}, {"userName": "Tia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5511694-tia", "userReview": "Where do I begin? This book was absolutely amazing. Well written. Tons of twists and turns. It made me angry, happy, sad, frustrated, and joyful. The entire book took me on an emotional journey. I loved the relationships that developed between Grace, Adelle, and Roxanne. I am happy that Rita and Roxanne became the best of friends. Ola Mae and Mattie were hilarious. Zero's character was brilliant and so was Junior's. I totally despised Ray Tanner, Del Tanner, and the other KKK members. YUCK!! When I think of them, all I can remember is the \"noose!\" There were many other characters that I enjoyed reading about as well (Billy, Daniel, Jack, the Purvis', Ellen, etc.). The ending of this book was beyond amazing. I imagined myself there, as it seemed so real to me. Lynne Bryant tied everything together at the very end.

The story takes place in Clarksville, Mississippi in the present, but flashes back to the 1930\u2019s when being black and living in the south was a dangerous combination. It is primarily about Roxanne, a middle-aged woman, member of the junior league and restorer of antebellum homes who reluctantly finds herself in charge of developing an historical tour of African American sites. My favorite part of this book is seeing how Roxanne changes from a superficial, ignorant woman with no true friendships as she learns about the racial history of her town and begins to develop friendships with several African American women. Some people have compared this book to The Help. I would say this is a very good book, but the depth of the writing didn\u2019t pull the emotion out of me the way The Help did.

When in Jackson, I stopped by Lemuria, my old stompin' grounds and one of the best damned bookstores in the country, to pick up an audio book to listen to on my road trip to Columbus, and while there, a bookseller told me about Catfish Alley by Lynne Bryant, which is set in Columbus and reminiscent of Kathryn Stockett's runaway bestseller, The Help. The book shuttles back and forth between 2002 and the years 1921-1931. Roxanne Reeves, director of her town's annual antebellum pilgrimage tour, and Grace Clark, a retired and quite elderly school teacher, anchor the modern segments, dipping randomly into the past with tales of Grace's youth, along with tales of her family and friends. When Lousia, a wealthy and influential Yankee suggests that the town add an African-American segment to the pilgrimage tour, Roxanne reluctantly agrees to do some research, with the hope that in doing so she will land the lucrative and prestigious renovation contract for Louisa's gorgeous antebellum home. Little does she realize that the awkward relationship she develops with Grace will become the most meaningful one in her life. Grace takes her on a weekly tour of the places in town with historical significance to the black community, and Roxanne grows less uncomfortable (saying \"more comfortable\" would, sadly, be overstating things) playing the minority role with each passing week, but she does become genuinely and wildly interested in all of Grace's stories, particularly those involving her beloved brother, Zero. While this book does not tread fresh ground, and most readers will be able to predict the various turns of the narrative, there is an emotional heft here. It is, of course, incredibly sad and awful to contemplate that a moderate-sized town in Mississippi in 2002 still has a strong racial divide. Like most real people in our country, the characters in this book have a difficult time talking about race in any meaningful or constructive way, and as a reader I felt that lack of substance rather keenly. But despite the many cliches (Roxanne tries to make friendly overtures with her maid after, oh, fifteen years of service; a racist white man learns some unpleasant facts about his father and seemingly overnight turns over a new leaf), there are some very somber and sobering moments, and because of narrative style we get several points of view that drive home just how deeply entrenched racism is, as well as the fear and bitterness that racism engenders--and that its purview is not solely south of the Mason-Dixon line. Catfish Alley is not a work of literary fiction by any means, but for me it was both an engaging and a quick read--what many people look for in a beach read, for example. I think its aim is higher than its reach in terms of a meaningful dialogue on race, but perhaps that is what will enable it to be widely read, because sometimes folks just don't want to have to face difficult and uncomfortable subjects. As it is, it comes across as a light read about women's relationships and thus will probably find toeholds among bookclubs and book bloggers in that genre. (Just to bring the point home, here are the Library of Congress classifications, in order, listed on the copyright page of my book. [shakes head in disbelief]: 1. Tour guides (Persons)--Fiction. 2 . Historic Sites -- Mississippi -- Fiction. 3. African-Americans -- Mississippi -- Fiction. 4. Mississippi -- Race relations -- Fiction. Because clearly this is a book first and foremost about tour guides. And once again, race gets relegated to the last position.)"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3124054-sarah", "userReview": "Catfish Alley is Mississippi-born Lynne Bryant's first novel -- and in reading it, I feel as if I've stumbled upon a rare gem!Flashing back and forth between present-day and 1920s-1930s Clarksville, Mississippi, Catfish Alley is a story that puts racism and deep friendship to the test. The novel explores racism and segregation that is still very much present in the South, no matter what people these days are made to believe. Being a Biloxi-born Mississipian myself, I can completely understand and appreciate the complexity and beauty of Catfish Alley.Roxanne Reeves is a white woman with a highly-coveted social standing who is asked to work on a project that covers African-American history within Clarksville for a touring of Antebellum Homes. For help with her special project, Roxanne meets with elderly Grace Clark, a retired black schoolteacher who has spent nearly her entire life in Clarksville and has witnessed and survived many a heartache throughout her years. While at first Roxanne is slightly put-off and uncomfortable with the project, she finds herself being irresistably lured in by Grace's stories about Clarksville and soon begins to question and explore her own feelings regarding Grace and her friends and racism in general.Readers can pretty much guess from the synopsis how the story ends; Roxanne and Grace become friends for life and Roxanne steps out of her comfort zone and into the other side of the rainbow, so to speak. But, this is not all that happens and the book's journey is very well worth the ride.In addition to Roxanne's self-development, readers are drawn in to the mystery surrounding Thomas \"Zero\" Clark, Grace's loving and charismatic older brother who befalls his own tragedy in 1931. Catfish Alley is told from the viewpoints of several different characters and has an EXTREMELY captivating story that unfolds and will keep you hooked until the very last page. I had a difficult time putting this novel down and I can't wait to let the rest of the world know about it.My final words on Catfish Alley are regarding my emotional involvement with the novel. While Roxanne was not my favorite character by far, I appreciated her transformation. In the beginning, I really had to bite my tongue and grit my teeth when her snooty, white, high-society acquantainces kept referring to \"blacks\"-this and \"blacks\"-that without any interjection from Roxanne. This novel may bring the more sensitive readers to tears, but overall is a pleasurable experience.I am looking forward to Lynne Bryant's future work and I truly hope Catfish Alley gets the high praise it deserves.For more reviews, visit http://dreamworldbooks.com."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6062200-erika", "userReview": "Catfish Alley by Lynne Bryant is a fiction book set in Clarksville, MS with the main character, Roxanne Reeves, discovering the history of the culture around her. Roxanne Reeves is afraid of being alone; also, she is nervous for someone possibly discovering her true upbringing. While feeling these ways, Roxanne gets put in charge of heading up an African-American tour in her town, which is still very segregated, even in 2002.Because she must get this tour going, she forces herself to meet many African-Americans, and finds hidden history - especially from 1931 - of which she'd been ignorant. Through her discoveries, she discovers more than just the past, she finds her own present.I enjoyed reading about Mississippi, as I lived there a small portion of my life, although I was born and raised in Louisiana. I've often wondered how life was between the races before the 1980s, when I came along. This book showed how very horrific life was for the African-Americans living in this time. The story reminded me that God created all men equal, and we should treat every person as we'd like to be treated ourselves. Period. So sad for all mistreated human beings.*Beware I am giving spoiler details below!*My two criticisms of the book are: 1) That everything worked itself out in the end, predictably. Good books don't need a perfectly wrapped up ending; they can have one, but this was one was predictable.2) Wasn't it a bit too unrealistic that Jr. didn't come back home to see his fianc\u00e9e or sister EVER in the 70 years he'd been gone? Fearing for your life would make you stay away a long time, so it's possible that this could have happened, but 70 years is nearly a life-time, and staying away from your fianc\u00e9e and close sister all this time and never once contacting either of them via mail, even, seems highly unprobable.Besides those above thoughts I mentioned, I greatly enjoyed this touching and entertaining story, and I am looking forward to Bryant's next book coming April 2012."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3605287-ellen", "userReview": "I really enjoyed Catfish Alley.

This story takes place in the present day but retraces through the 20's and 30's in the south and how one small town's history has shaped it's future. The author retells the story of what it was like to grow up in the south from both both an African American and white perspective. Very well written, an excellent first for Lynne Bryant."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5093141-patricia", "userReview": "Being Southern, I was excited to read this book. I enjoy reading books about my area of the country. This book is set in a small town in Mississippi during the early years of the 21st century, with a back story in the 1930's. It follows the lives of Grace and her family and friends. And how racism affected them and how it has and hasn't changed in modern times. The back story was gripping and emotional and had me unable to put the book down. The modern day part seemed a little harsh on the racism to the South I know. All in all an enjoyable book that I would recommend."}, {"userName": "Sheena  at Hot Eats and Cool Reads", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2718510-sheena-at-hot-eats-and-cool-reads", "userReview": "This is one of those books that I am so glad I stumbled across. It goes back and forth between the early 2000's and 1930's Mississippi and tells an amazing story of the racial issues that all characters go through, past and present. I was feeling some of the same emotions as the characters and the story that eventually came out was very sad, but very true of those times. I would recommend this to anyone who liked The Help!"}, {"userName": "Star", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5569502-star", "userReview": "If you liked The Help you must read this. Key difference between the two books is the timeframe, Catfish Alley takes place in 1931 and 2002. I do have to admit that I didn't really think that the attitudes of southern whites in 2002 was as racist as portrayed in the book. I am sure that is a reflection on my understanding not the reality."}, {"userName": "Ashlei Peavie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7218880-ashlei-peavie", "userReview": "This was a really good book.

I couldn\u2019t help but be made aware of every flaw, though, because one of the previous readers of this copy, made it their mission to edit EVERY sentence and left their penciled notations from cover to cover!

Roxanne Reeves defines her life by the committees she heads and the social status she cultivates. But she is keeping secrets that make her an outsider in her own town, always in search of acceptance. And when she is given a job none of the other white women want-researching the town's African-American history for a tour of local sites-she feels she can't say no. Elderly Grace Clark, a retired black schoolteacher, reluctantly agrees to become Roxanne's guide. Grace takes Roxanne to Catfish Alley, whose undistinguished structures are nonetheless sacred places to the black community because of what happened there. As Roxanne listens to Grace's stories, and meets her friends, she begins to see differently. She is transported back to the past, especially to 1931, when a racist's hatred for Grace's brother leads to events that continue to change lives decades later. And as Roxanne gains an appreciation of the dreams, courage, and endurance of those she had so easily dismissed, her own life opens up in new and unexpected ways.", "title": "Catfish Alley", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9800938-catfish-alley", "average": 4.03, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436791667l/9800938.jpg", "reviews": 159, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4487331.Lynne_Bryant", "name": "Lynne Bryant"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "American", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9800938-catfish-alley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10829492-catfish-alley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13373321-alligator-lake", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36902968-neinfricatul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
