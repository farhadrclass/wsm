Overall, it was a good story opposing factions, spies, betrayal, Apache battles, sorrow, and of course zombies. I think the new author picking up the series did a pretty good job of keeping all the characters the same, which is much appreciated; but, it still feels like theirs just a little something missing from the original Z.A. Recht books."}, {"userName": "Ryan H", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14998572-ryan-h", "userReview": "It was long overdue but this was an excellent continuation of a story that was not done being told yet. All of our beloved characters made appearances which I really liked and the familiar landscapes and world brought me right back into the storyline. This book made me remember all the nuances that I really really enjoyed about the series. I listen to the audiobook version of this and they even brought back the original narrator which was great. The tone and urgency along with all of his characters voices were unbelievably done. It is a great addition to the story and the story line. I did find the middle of the book lacking and I did lose interest at one part but it is not a dealbreaker. This is awesome character driven zombie fun."}, {"userName": "Herb Dettmer", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61820200-herb-dettmer", "userReview": "The continuation of the story was entertaining. however the errors in location and terminology were (for me) very distracting. There were many but I did not keep a list but here a few: Omaha is in Nebraska not Kansas, Ft McCoy is not a USAF location (US Army), a Bradley fighting vehicle is not a Cheetah (MMPV). and the military pistols and rifles are loaded with a MAGAZINE not a CLIP, clips are used to load rounds into a magazine, and the terms are not interchangeable. These might be niggly errors to some but are distracting to at least me. Please get better proofreaders."}, {"userName": "Kody", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39693560-kody", "userReview": "Great addition to the originalsWe will always miss the original authors style of writing but this was a very good book and the writer did a great job reviving a story that was not done being told I'm so glad the series has been brought back from the dead no pun intended to be finished I know there's still one more book left to read I was just thrilled that this great series has been carried on thank you to the writer"}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57543917-philip", "userReview": "Disappointing compared to the first three books in the series. I did not realise it was a different author until coming on to write this review and it explains a lot. The plot was weak and had quite a few issues and the language and style really started to grate with me."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "The saga of the Morningstar Strain continues. The battle against the shamblers and sprinters goes on as does the war between the remnants of the Federal Government and the RSA (Reunited States of America). The action is continuous and the tension builds as the tale moves on. How the survivors are going to reverse this plague is never certain. At the same time that the battle between the Feds and RSA continue during this chaos is insane. The conclusion to the Morningstar Strain is well written and delivered with passion."}, {"userName": "Edward A.
