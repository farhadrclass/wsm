But of course, I have to be the person who didn\u2019t love this book! Married for 10 years with three children, it might seem like Catherine and Simon have the perfect marriage. But when Simon disappears without a trace, Catherine comes to learn that she never really knew the man she married. Flash forward 25 years, Simon has returned determined to punish Catherine for her wrongs. The two share with one another what happened over the course of their time apart, and buried secrets begin to emerge. At this point, it seems as if the reader is being set up for an expert game of cat and mouse. But as they share more and more, and tell and tell and tell, NOTHING really happens. And things move SLOWLY. All I wanted to know was why Simon left?!  Little clues do emerge, and I was hoping I was being teased for a big reveal. But as I read more and more, and NOTHING happened, I grew rather frustrated. And once Simon finally told Catherine his rationale for leaving, I wanted to jump in the book and beat the crap out of him!  Not because of why he did what he did (which is just stupidly awful), but because I had to wait so freakin long to find out! Sadly, it all just felt so contrived.I received a copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kaceey - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13442817-kaceey---traveling-sister", "userReview": "A Traveling Sister read with Brenda and Lindsay! 3.5* Catherine wakes up in the morning oblivious that her world is about to change forever.

Including the journey Simon traveled to find himself in his new life. Which at times became soooo far-fetched! He was not at all a likable character. In fact, I ended up having a love-hate relationship with this book. I absolutely loathed everything about Simon, wishing him ill-will at every turn. Yet, I couldn't pull myself away from tale he told.Aren't the best books the ones that make you feel unsettled, setting off a wave of emotion within you?

Norma with a full weekend ahead had to drop out as well, leaving Kaceey, Lindsay and me as the last standing Sisters for this read When You Disappeared is a family drama thriller that is heavy on the drama and light on the thrills. Some parts of the story dragged and were unrealistic for us. We had the believability police on duty for this one and reporting back to the rest of us. We found much to be unrealistic but came to the conclusion it was for the convenience of the story and thought it was written more for drama than believability. The story is told by Catherine and Simon in two different timelines which we all enjoyed. At times when the story dragged we really wanted Catherine to put down the wine and do something. We really had some strong feelings of dislike for Simon and there was nothing likable about his unlikeable character for us. The story had no suspense for me and I was rushing to get to the end but for Kaceey and Lindsay the suspense kept them turning the pages to see how it ended. In the end, we all found the ending to be over the top and underwhelming. We still recommend for thriller lovers who really like a lot of drama to their thrillers.

This novel had such potential with a highly enticing premise, however, the extreme lack of believability meant the story fell flat for me.I enjoyed the way the story unfolded. The novel was told through Catherine and Simon\u2019s perspectives ranging from 28 years ago to a present-day meeting. The author, John Marrs, does a great job revealing pieces of the story in a suspenseful and intriguing way, all the while making me curious to see how the story would play out. Unfortunately, many of the situations, particularly those involving Simon seemed highly unlikely and absurd. Believability is a huge requirement for my reading enjoyment - I have a hard time truly immersing myself within a story that isn\u2019t realistic (the \u201cbelievability police\u201d within me kicks in quickly!). My reading mind can stretch to accept slightly exaggerated situations, but the list is fairly long of the things that I found far-fetched within this novel. There were some very serious parts to this story that really pulled at my emotions and maternal instincts. I had a hard time reading some pages as there is such a devastating family loss that deeply affected me. Overall, I found this to be an averagely enjoyable read with nothing that truly made it stand out other than its lack of believability.

I saw many reviews and it does seem this is a polarizing book. Some hated it, some loved it, and most hate-loved it. Having read it, I can understand these opinions. I will say that even those who seemed to dislike the book the most, admitted that it really made them feel something, and that is a marker of a great book in my opinion. This is a book I won't soon forget.I would not characterize this book as a psychological thriller, or even really a domestic thriller. Though there are secrets not unveiled until the end, you understand from early on much of what is going on. You know where Simon went the day he disappeared, and you know what Catherine went through as she struggled to find her footing. As the blurb says, Catherine of course is a mother of three who wakes up one day to find her husband missing. In a very real way, she does not initially really think of him as missing. From early in the day, there is a very reasonable explanation for why he is not there.But as the first chapter unfolds, we see Simon returning to visit Catherine 25 years after his disappearance. She's in the same cottage where they made their home. Simon is in a bespoke suit. These are two people who have lived very different lives from the ones they pictured when they were first newlyweds.The story moves back and forth between Simon and Catherine, and begins the day he disappeared and then flashes forward to present day, when Simon and Catherine are telling their stories of where they have been and what happened to them. This is a book that is completely about the journey. At times it is difficult to read. Simon seems so selfish and Catherine seems so wounded. But ultimately, it was hard to clearly decide who to blame until the very end of the book.I don't want to spoil anything, because this is really a good read. I will say that contrary to many readers, I wasn't left completely hating either Simon or Catherine. There were of course things that I hated about them (one in particular), but mostly I just felt sorry for them. This is a novel about the lasting damage that can occur through our childhood. Our parents, our environment, our friends, and our experiences from a young age truly shape how we approach situations as adults. We see this theme not just through Simon and Catherine, but through other characters as well: Sophia and Luca; James, Robbie, and Emily; Dougie; Doreen. I recommend this book fully, with the caveat that there are some sensitive topics that arise throughout."}, {"userName": "Ingstje", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16236266-ingstje", "userReview": "After reading both of his novels I can say that I\u2019m officially addicted! He\u2019s got what it takes to completely transport me to another country and another lifetime and he really let the characters come alive so much in this novel that they crept under my skin. When You Disappeared is a deeply character-driven family drama and I was really invested in the characters (or one of them at least). This is a novel that\u2019s all about the journey and isn\u2019t fast-paced in that way but more of a slow unfolding and discovery of the characters throughout the story. Don\u2019t expect it to focus on an investigation after Simon went missing and you\u2019ll be absolutely fine.The novel starts with Simon\u2019s return after 25 years and then turning back to his decision to disappear and leave his childhood sweetheart Catherine and his 3 children so many years ago. He actually planned to take his own life but in the end he decided that would be too easy, better to let his wife suffer and wonder what happened to him so he just vanished\u2026 until now. The reason why he left is surrounded by mystery but it must be something terrible is all I could assume. It is much worse than I thought though\u2026 that ending, knowing, finally understanding it, realizing\u2026 it\u2019s harrowing!When he knocks on her door after such a long time and after she\u2019s overcome the shock of seeing him again, Catherine demands why he left and what she did to him that make him take this action. He\u2019s there to tell her why he\u2019s resented her all this time but first she has to hear what she made him do while he was away. He tells her he set fire, he stole and killed and it was all due to her. She quashed his dreams and ideas and all he knew was that true happiness was non-existent. When you think you\u2019ll have it, something dark and rotten will turn it around and take it away. He\u2019d seen it often enough, with his mother, with the \u2018perfect\u2019 family of his friend Douglas, and then what his wife did. It sounds bitter and there is definitely a heaviness I felt when I was reading this book but thankfully positive notes became more and more prominent the further I advanced into the novel.There\u2019s nothing that gives an idea as to what happened but the alternating storylines of their pasts gave me a pretty good idea of who these people were, their true selves come forward through their actions and how they coped with their struggles. I learned how he led a decadent life without worries while she tried to pick herself up, got 3 jobs to provide for her children. Even though Catherine did something so awful that Simon gave up everything and I should probably have sympathized with him for making such a grave decision, I didn\u2019t, not one moment really. He pushed his family out of his mind just too easily, he did atrocious things and I found myself not feeling sorry for him and not sympathising anymore. I was wondering if the author was going to make me feel guilty and swing my sympathies by the end of the novel but I can\u2019t say. I can only confirm that I felt deeply for one of them in the end.It took until the end of the novel to be enlightened why he finally came back and is even so many years after the facts still trying to instill guilt. Their interactions in the present were like a dance, seeing what their truths did to the other when hearing them so honestly declared. It was fascinating to see how they spent their lives and slowly they are coming to the crux of the story with a twist, a turn of events that I never imagined and was so tragic.I\u2019m not sure this novel is for everyone, it\u2019ll have some divided opinions probably because of this unlikeable character and the lack of exciting things happening, but I was really drawn into it. When You Disappeared was a rich story that had me completely immersed."}, {"userName": "Al *the serial series skipper*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4167077-al-the-serial-series-skipper", "userReview": "[Simon, the MC , abandons his wife and 3 kids, he ups and leaves one morning, while she still mourns the death of one of her children.

SUMMARYCatherine and Simeon have known each other since they were eleven years old, have been a couple longer than most people can remember and are now married with three children. Although their family recently suffered a devastating loss, their marriage seems incredibly solid. Just when they seem to be healing from their loss and the whole family is beginning to move forward, Simeon goes out for his morning run and never comes back. The police are alerted, the whole area is searched over and over again. Finally, after months of investigating, the police stop searching and the whole village is left to assume he either had an accident of some kind and his body never surfaced or he abandoned his family. Catherine just knows he would NEVER leave them and continues to search for years. Pretty early in the story we learn that he purposely left this family but the question of 'why' he left continues to haunt the reader until the very end of the book. What could have been so bad that he would leave Catherine, their three children and the life they build together???? The book is written from the POV of both Catherine and Simeon, skipping back and forth in time from the events leading up to Simeon's disappearance to the present day, 25 years later. It works well for the story and was never confusing. WHAT I LOVEDI have to say I absolutely adore Brit Lit!!!! I love the variations in the wording - mum for mom/ jumper for sweater etc. I love both quaint countryside settings and the large city feel of London. I just find it all so charming. This book was gave me my much loved British experience. I found the character study portions of the book fascinating!!! Loved Catherine's metamorphism from a dependent housewife to the sole family breadwinner, I was impressed with how she adapted to her change in circumstances even though she had a rough start. Learning of Simeon's childhood; how his mother was in and out of his life and the long term effects it had on his life made me feel badly for him BUT didn't excuse any of the sociopathic things he did. Most of all, I found the parts about how someone can be so different at various stages of their live / circumstances fascinating and the concept of how you can think you know a person and they can do something you NEVER imagined possible. Definitely thought provoking material. It was addictively readable. I was glued to it from page one to the very last sentence. I ABSOLUTELY needed to find out why Simeon left, what he did while he was gone and how Catherine and their children made it without him. While I totally and completely hated Simeon as a person, he did make a very despicable yet interesting character so I cannot count it against the book. WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE Toward the end, the story was told of what exactly the family's the devastating loss was and how it occurred. Those chapters were incredibly hard to read. I had to skim it because it was WAY too disturbing for me to read in it's entirety and then I had to remind myself over and over that it was just a work of fiction. There were several things in the book which seemed highly improbable and made me roll my eyes. The biggest issue was Luciana's story. I highly doubt her situation has even once happened in real life to anyone ever in the history of the world. I can't say more without a spoiler but you will know what I'm referring to if you read it. Then, the very last couple of pages involving Simeon's reaction to everything made me roll my eyes too. Just kind of a weird way to end the book. I would say melodramatic, but considering what all happened, maybe calling it 'weird' or an 'odd choice' is the correct description. OVERALLThis is a book I would recommend for people who like thrillers and are either okay with a few disturbing elements or are able to skim through the more disturbing passages. It is well written enough so the reader has a growing sense of fascinated unease starting about a third of the way through the book and gaining momentum as it progresses. In the end, it leaves the reader feeling like they have been on a long rough journey."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/897583-sarah", "userReview": "You can find all of our reviews at https://reallyintothis.comHappy Reading, friends!

He was gone for a Really long time & my Aunt asked me in a joking way, \u201cDo you ever think he just won\u2019t come back?\u201dYOUR HUSBAND IS GONEHe did eventually come back to the car & we had an enjoyable trip. Luckily, have a spouse that I love & trust. But, so did Catherine. As a reader, when I put myself in Catherine\u2019s place I can\u2019t breathe.

What is he hiding? Did his fatherly roles take a toll on him & he couldn\u2019t hang anymore? Is he just an awful person that did his family a favor by leaving them behind?

This was ok, but I can't honestly go as far as saying that I enjoyed it. Quite a frustrating read. I had the urge to slap the male protagonist, Simon. He had no redeeming features whatsoever. On top of that, I couldn't even find a lot of sympathy for the female lead, Catherine, who ends up raising their three children by herself after Simon simply disappears one day. Told from Simon and Catherine's perspectives and switching between the present and the past, this was a character driven family drama, which I found very, very slow. Nothing wrong with the writing itself, but some of the story, in particular some of the events in Simon's life after his disappearance, were extremely far-fetched. Unfortunately, I guessed some of the secrets before they were revealed so that added to the lack of suspense. Overall, a bit underwhelmed by my first experience of a John Marrs' book, but I have his latest on my Kindle and will definitely give it a try.The audio version is nicely done by a male and a female narrator."}, {"userName": "Tracy Fenton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18478389-tracy-fenton", "userReview": "This is a brilliant debut novel.

And this is pretty much the premises for When You Disappear. The story opens with the day Simon left and follows the impact this has on his family, and on Simon himself, when he reappears twenty-five years later, Catherine will finally learn who he really is, and that\u2019s when the book gets really interesting as there are shocks and dark buried secrets galore. I absolutely loved The One by John Marrs so I really wanted to read When You Disappeared the author\u2019s debut novel. Although it made for a good read I did have mixed emotions regarding the book as a whole some parts I really enjoyed and other parts I struggled with. Personally I felt this book read more like a mystery until just over the halfway mark when the psychological thriller element kicked in. I do have to mention Simon what an evil, cold hearted individual John Marr\u2019s has created he doesn\u2019t have one endearing feature, and at times he literally made my blood boil, sometimes I think having strong feelings for a character even if they are negative ones can actually heighten my enjoyment of a book, but unfortunately I disliked him so much it actually distracted from my enjoyment of When You Disappeared.When You Disappeared is told in alternating chapters past and present from the two main characters POV, unfortunately I did find the constant change sometimes made the chapters feel disjointed. Although I can see why the author used this ploy I did find it slightly distracted from my enjoyment of this book. I would describe this book as a Character driven family drama and so I found the pace quite slow, although I do feel the author builds on the suspense and tension as he slowly reveals Simon\u2019s darkest secrets. There is no doubt the author hasn\u2019t written a captivating tale that many readers will enjoy with an original plot.

Twenty-five years ago, Simon chose to walk out on his wife and children. Hitching to Europe, he began a new carefree life, giving little thought to those he left behind.Today, Simon knocks on Catherine's door to finally lay the ghosts to rest. Why did he leave? The answer to this is told in alternating chapters by husband and wife, both now and in the past. The twisted web of secrets and lies had me reading long into the night, as each chapter became more layered, more complex, more shocking, more heart-wrenching. An original, dark, disturbing, gripping read; a true page-turner."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23068367-liz", "userReview": "[That scene where Simon burns down the hostel was probably the most shocking scene for me in terms of his deluded selfishness and it still reels me up!

For a husband to walk away from his family, leaving them with no clue as to whether he is dead or alive seems rather callous. As a reader we know that he is alive and well but Catherine and the children can but imagine the worst case scenario when after days, weeks, months and then years pass they have no sign of him. The years pass and we see Simon living a seemingly carefree life for the majority of the time, anything that happens that threatens his peace causes him to burn his bridges and walk away to start a new chapter of his life in a new place. His methods are definitely questionable as are his morals at some points and I found him to be a very self centred person. Catherine and the children slowly manage to rebuild a new life for themselves but it takes much longer for them to find peace. Even towards the end of the story when Simon eventually faces his demons \u2013 again for selfish reasons I felt \u2013 although I understood more about him, I still found him a very unlikeable character. His behaviour changed the lives of many people around him who he purported to love deeply, and even at the end of his story I still felt that he did not accept any responsibility for the pain he had caused. In his eyes, there was always someone else who had made him react the way he did. Because of this, I would say that this is a compelling read which provoked a lot of feeling in me but to say that I enjoyed it would be a step too far.I can imagine some reviewers marking this book down because of that, but the depth of the personalities of the characters I felt made this a good read. Therefore I would give it a strong 4 stars.I have found this to be quite a complicated tale which has made me feel strongly about the main character. I don't want to give anything away but I have had mixed feelings as his side of the story is related through the book. I definitely side with wife Catherine throughout, and it's a wonder that the children turned out so well adjusted all things considered. I have found it a compelling read but the word enjoyable doesn't seem appropriate."}, {"userName": "Zoe Mann", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65629974-zoe-mann", "userReview": "'When you disappeared' by John Marrs is a roller coaster journey that will leave you with whip lash and asking yourself.. what the **** just happened? Catherine and Simon have just gone through every parent's worst nightmare of losing a child. For weeks Catherine's legs couldn't physically hold her weight and sorrow so she has been curled up in bed mourning the loss of her son. She now feels ready to face the world and to rebuild her and her family's lives, however, when she wakes up her husband Simon isn't there and when he still hasn't returned by dinner time she reports him missing. With all of his belongings still exactly where they always are she has to face the reality that something dreadful has happened to her beloved. Catherine goes through the motions again of someone whose life has been turned upside down. After months of no answers she accepts that her husband is dead as what husband would leave his already grieving wife and 3 children behind? 25 years later Catherine has come full circle and her children are grown. The family go to Simon's grave every Christmas but they have accepted he is gone and have moved on with their lives. You can only imagine Catherine's surprise when a tall, tanned, elderly man shows up unannounced on her doorstep claiming to be her dead husband and wanting to explain what happened all those years ago. You will not be prepared for what is about to be revealed and Catherine will be left wishing she never opened her door to the man she once loved who is now a stranger. 'When you disappeared' was a slow burner for me. It took me 2 weeks to complete when I can complete books in 1 sitting. I don't feel the speed you read a book is a representation of the quality. I have whizzed through books in barely a few hours which have been utter garbage. I just want to include this so people stick with it and believe me the build up and scene setting is worth every minute. Finally John Marrs please write a second instalment. I need to know what happens to Catherine after her world is once again blown wide open.

She isn\u2019t too concerned and assumes he has just gone out for a jog. It isn\u2019t until he does not show up for work and does not return home that she realizes something must have happened to him. This is the premise of this story\u2026where did Simon go? And why did he leave without a word?The story alternates time periods and the perspective of Catherine and Simon. This format works really well for this book and John Marrs does a fantastic job of building the storyline and slowly revealing all of the hidden secrets, big and small, that this story has to offer.It was a bit of a slow burn for me. I enjoyed Catherine\u2019s storyline more than Simon\u2019s. I found myself really despising Simon for leaving his wife and children without a word. She is suddenly thrust into being a single parent and needing to provide for her children both emotionally and financially. I can\u2019t imagine the courage it would take to do that! How does one not completely fall apart while missing the love of your life under circumstances that you don\u2019t understand.As if I didn\u2019t feel bad enough for Catherine and the children, there is a part about halfway through the book involving the family dog that nearly broke my heart (no, he didn\u2019t die). I had to step away for a moment to compose myself\u2026grrr that Simon!This book won\u2019t go down as an all-time favorite, but I did enjoy it and look forward to reading more by John Marrs.*Thank you NetGalley, Thomas & Mercer, and John Marrs for the opportunity to read and review this book for my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "B.E.L.L.A.Mc", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47382252-b-e-l-l-a-mc", "userReview": "[FREE to read with Kindle Unlimited in the UK.

It is set partially in the present day - when Simon has reappeared on Catherine's doorstep after 25 years, finally ready to explain - and partially in the past, starting 25 years ago on the day he disappeared and alternating between Simon and Catherine's points of view. A little while ago, I read \nThe Good Samaritan\n by this same author, John Marrs, and really enjoyed it. It was twisty, thrilling and mysterious and the central character was just the right amount of psychotic that meant she was, if not likeable, at least enjoyable to read about. I was hoping for the same again in this book. Sadly, it fell short of my expectations. The bulk of the book was much more family-drama than thriller, and what twists and mysteries there were were small and somewhat predictable. This would have been fine if it was interesting - and Catherine's chapters were; I enjoyed her spirit and her ability to overcome. But Simon's chapters were boring to me and I just did not care about his character and what he was up to most of the time at all. I found myself skim reading his chapters after a little while. I'm still giving it three stars as I did enjoy Catherine's chapters and honestly I believe I wouldn't have been disappointed in it if I hadn't previously loved another of the author's books. I still fully intend to read more of his work - I think maybe \nThe One\n next."}], "description": "When Catherine wakes up alone one morning, she thinks her husband has gone for a run before work.
