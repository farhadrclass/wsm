I do love a good short story, particularly when it's of the horror/thriller/paranormal variety, and this book is full of them!I particularly liked \"Wipeout,\" a tale of an ornery old lady who finally gets her comeuppance, and \"Cold\" (hello? Who doesn't love a creepy morgue tale?), to name a few, but there is really something in this collection for all tastes, from ghostly children, to an E.T.Little Terrors is full of just that. And that's what makes it so much fun!"}, {"userName": "John Wood", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9352033-john-wood", "userReview": "This British author has a twisted, delightfully humorous mind! There is a wonderful variety of selections and I enjoyed every one! Beware the blue language and occasional gay slurs. These devices, however, are essential to the characters. And they are definitely characters! The only downside is the British spellings and references. So if you have a twisted sense of humor and ready for a quick ride of offbeat horror jump on!"}, {"userName": "Pamela Faust", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6724562-pamela-faust", "userReview": "Very good collection of scary stories. Most of them came up with an interesting twist at the end. My favorite was the first story that told of a young boy who entered a neighbor's haunted house on a dare with the promise of his friend's sister to be his prize. That brought my new favorite quote: \"Young love is too hopeful for such realism.\""}, {"userName": "kozettekaysmith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26921996-kozettekaysmith", "userReview": "Expected MoreNot as good as the last two book's by Mr Jester, Not as scary as I thought after reading the reviews. If you want something that's hard to put down and creeps you out it's not this one.
