Having read and really enjoyed the prequel novella, Rock With You I was expecting to be impressed and I was not disappointed.Ethan and Gabby gelled really well together for me, in that both of them were not looking for commitment for their own particular reasons, but also both knowing that the connection growing between them as their \u2018fake\u2019 relationship progresses is more than they have ever felt for someone previously. \"If this were a real date, you would so be getting luck tonight.\"But whereas Gabby starts to embrace those feelings and emotions as time progresses, Ethan very much tries to stick to their agreement, even though he steps outside of their boundaries with more and more frequency as the story moves along.\nThis man\u2026 He was so wrong for her yet so completely right. And right now, she never, ever wanted to let him go\u2026\nThere is a lot going on in this story, what with the introduction of Ethan\u2019s partners and long-time friends; Ryan and Mark (who will have their own stories told in future books). The struggles they face with the town Council for the development of their new business Off-The-Grid Adventures, as Adrenalin sports are considered out of keeping with Haven\u2019s relaxing atmosphere. As well as Dixie, Ethan\u2019s much loved and spunky Grandmother, and her medical issues and issues with Gabby\u2019s ex popping up intermittently. \"Baby, you have caused me more blue balls than you will ever know.\"And for the most part all those aspects really worked in relation to the development of the story-line as a whole, I think the whole ex situation was a bit superfluous in the overall scheme of things, but it didn\u2019t figure too much in the story as a whole so much as to detract from the growing relationship between Ethan and Gabby.\"I feel like I\u2019ve spent my whole life running away from my past, but I could never get away from it\u2026\"I love me a series, set in a small town, with recurring characters, and add in a diverse mix of leading ladies and men, with a different story for each of them as the series progresses and I am generally a happy reader. Rachel ticked all my required boxes in that respect, and I cannot wait to read more of this series, and more from this author in general in the future.Crazy For You; Ryan and Emma\u2019s book is due early 2017, and I cannot wait to see what story the author gives them. But I have to admit Can\u2019t Forget You; is the one I am itching for, there was something about Mark Dalton in this book that intrigued me, but it\u2019s not due til October 17, so I will have to try and wait as patiently as possible for it. Rachel is a new author to me with this series, so I have plenty to read in the interim while waiting for the aforementioned to be released.ARC generously provided via Netgalley, through Tasty Book Tours in exchange for the above honest review."}, {"userName": "Angie - Angie's Dreamy Reads", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8524618-angie---angie-s-dreamy-reads", "userReview": "3.5 sweet starsRun to You by Rachel Lacey is a fast paced, heartwarming romance that I really liked. It was my first read by this author and once I started, I couldn't put it down. I instantly loved the characters, the small town feel, and the steamy build that Ethan and Gabby had going on. It was good! Really good! The writing was great. The plot was sweet. The characters even sweeter. And overall this was a pleasing, fun read. Gabby is spending time (the summer) in the town of Haven. She needed an escape after a brutal break up that left her living with her parents! Actually, she just needed a \"life\" break. Time to figure out who she is and what she wants. She's rented a house in Haven, and as a gaming code writer, she's able to take the time without worrying too much. Ethan is about to open a business called Off-the-Grid Adventures! It's an extreme sports facility that would offer zip lining, rock climbing etc etc. He's a man with a plan. And that plan includes his friends Ryan and Mark. They are all in business together. Ethan and Gabby meet when Gabby accidentally wonders onto Ethan's property. Unfortunately the meeting is less than graceful as Gabby is in the process of being stung by a nest of Yellow Jackets. But Ethan Hunter has been living in the town of Haven forever, he knows the outdoors well, and he comes to Gabby's rescue easily. It really is a very cute set up to a first meeting.From there, Ethan and Gabby take off (with the help of Ethan's matchmaking Grandma, Dixie, of course)! And things become complicated in ways they never expected. Run To You is addicting. A sweet romance that is PERFECT for a lazy Sunday or even an afternoon at the pool. The feels are sweet. The characters fun. And the story line is heart tugging. Ethan is the perfect alpha hero -- sexy and easy going, but under all that is a man who is hiding from the world. And Gabby .. well, she finds so much more than just herself in Haven. Overall, like I said, I really liked it. Quick. Easy. Good. I would absolutely recommended it to those looking for a happy read.ARC received in exchange for an honest review FOLLOW ME ON: FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | TWITTER | BLOG"}, {"userName": "WhiskeyintheJar/Kyraryker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2763722-whiskeyinthejar-kyraryker", "userReview": "2.5 starsI received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.After getting out of a bad relationship, Gabby decides to spend the summer in the small town of Haven. There she hopes to rediscover herself and her strength. When an angry nest of hornets pushes her into the arms of a sexy stranger, their chemistry may have Gabby going against her no men rule. Ethan is captivated by the gorgeous woman in a flowing skirt and boots. Their instant chemistry has him wanting to spend more time with her and she provides the perfect opportunity to give his Grandmother the allusion that he's found someone. With business, family, and ex-boyfriend drama, Gabby and Ethan will have to decide if their instant chemistry is worth more than just a summer fling.\u00a0The first in a new series (it does seem to have a couple from a previous book by this author that makes a brief appearance) we are introduced Gabby and Ethan. Gabby is freshly out of a relationship where the ex-boyfriend got physical with her, her parents are distant, clueless, and generally uncaring, and she's looking to find herself and her strength. Ethan is dealing with trying to get his Off the Grid Adventures business off the ground, finding out that his grandmother has an aneurysm that could burst at anytime, and the baggage of having an abusive father who ended up killing his mother. They both had issues but their backgrounds are nothing new we haven't seen in romance and the checking off a list and clich\u00e9 way they are portrayed, lack of depth, made them seem very been there and done that. The wheel is not getting reinvented here, or improved, or frankly, given any spark. \u00a0When our hero and heroine first meet, they are instantly attracted to one another and throughout the book; I'm not sure their relationship really surpassed \"you're hot\" stage. Gabby sees how close and how much Ethan dotes on his grandmother and Ethan sees Gabby stick up for herself even when she is scared. The trope of them pretending to be in a relationship for the sake of his grandmother, again, is nothing new and while it can obviously work, it was missing some life. They both obviously like one another, so the only obstacle was Gabby not sure she wants to get right back into a relationship, her problem with it just kind of fades away and Ethan thinking he will be just like his father and end up hitting his girlfriend/wife is dragged on. Obviously, it's a heavy issue that Ethan is dealing with but whether through a combination of the over saturation of this trope used in contemporary romance or the lack of depth given to the characters and story, his issue ended up feeling trite and an obvious placed road block to keep the story going. \u00a0Gabby and Ethan did interact well and Ethan's two other business partners who are his friends, are clearly set-up for their own books. The interaction and dialogue between our main couple and secondary characters flowed really well and helped to create the small town feeling, giving the story a more cohesive feel. This book and what the series looks to be shaping up to be, could definitely be compared to a Jill Shalvis series with the similarities to characters but with a little less life and spark to them and tamer sex scenes. \u00a0Ethan's grandmother will probably end up stealing your heart but the paint by numbers villain ex-boyfriend, forced overreaction by Ethan at the end, and general lack of spark will leave you wanting more. If you're looking for something in the similar vein of Shalvis with tamer sex scenes though, this might work for you."}, {"userName": "Anna's Herding Cats", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5417092-anna-s-herding-cats", "userReview": "Reviewed for herding cats & burning soup.Amazon: http://amzn.to/2bTVBfIRun to You. Yall. I couldn't put this one down. From fake mates to great friendships and starting over, heartbreak, hope and a little daring. Run to You was just a lovely read and beginning to a new series.The quick of it is that Ethan's grandmom has one wish before she dies...to see Ethan settled down and happy. And she's sure new-girl-in-town Gabby is just the one that's going to make that happen. She may only have a few weeks left but Ethan is determined to give his gram everything she's hoping for even if it means faking a relationship with the town's new arrival for just a little while.Alright. Gabby and Ethan. They were fun. He's a former Olympian turned adventure business owner and she's a video game developer. He's a daredevil and she's all about keeping both feet on the ground. But they were cute together as they faked it. And very sweet as they slowly helped each other heal from their pasts--a bad childhood that left him thinking he could never trust himself with women and a very bad relationship that knocked down her self confidence. The only quibble I had was some less than stellar choices on the heroine's part later in the book. It wasn't a deal breaker but I really wanted to give her a thunk.I love the whole fake mates trope and seeing them trying so hard to not get attached but totally getting attached. They had nice chemistry and a couple hot and heavy moments. But most of it was just them healing and becoming real friends. Now, the big storyline was Ethan and his Gram. And omg, yall, it had me in tears. These two were so damn touching. She's his world and the one who saved him from foster care as a child and has always been there for him. It was heartbreaking seeing them dealing with their potential loss and making the most of the days they had left. Simple nights in, working down her bucket list, going on mini vacations. It was just. It was incredibly moving. All in all, Run to You was a delightful and touching read. It was more emotional than I expected but so damn sweet. Lacey did a wonderful job of balancing lighthearted, sexy fun and emotional turmoil. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more from the series and some of the side characters that were met during this one."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3264457-irene", "userReview": "4.5 starsI really enjoyed Run To You.The storyline was sweet, fun, heartwarming and very entertaining.From the first meeting, Gabby and Ethan captured my interest and I couldn't get enough of them.

Meeting Ethan and spending time with him starts to make her feel things she wasn't emotionally ready to acknowledge.

Rachel Lacey's contemporary romance told from the third person points of view flows serenely from beginning to end. Run to You hails as a classic, easy love story from Forever romance. Both Ethan Hunter and Gabby Winters are hiding from past troubles. While spending a summer away in Haven Gabby meets Ethan rather when she least expects. Ethan lives a carefree existence, trying to construct a future free of attachments except for his dream of opening an outdoor adventure spot in his hometown. With Ethan's fun and spirited Gram having health issues, Ethan and Gabby embark on a fake relationship. They're fast friends and their chemistry is palpable. Throughout the middle of the book I felt the story was dragging a bit. There was a lot of superfluous detail and some redundancy about each characters hang ups in their personal lives causing the prose to become a bit stagnant. For this chunk of the middle I felt a bit disconnected from the story and characters. However, with certain events the plot became energized again and I was more than interested in knowing how Ethan and Gabby's relationship would play out. With more colorful characters in the townspeople and Ethan's buddies the story also had an edge of intrigue for what's to come for the other two most eligible bachelors now back in the small town of Haven.

The characters easily captivated me and had me experiencing all their emotions along with them. I liked Gabby and her quirky, sometimes awkward, ways. She really kept the book interesting and her character added a sense of humor to it. Really though, all of the characters were amazing and I loved the group of people we got to meet in this book. Gabby and Ethan had a wonderful relationship and I loved how they both had their hangups but it didn't stop them from recognizing their feeling for each other. Even with Ethan being a bit more stubborn about those feelings, it was great to read about him realizing he needed to live his life and leave the past behind.

There are some other great characters in this town and I'm hoping the companion books are Mark and Ryan.

That enhance not only the story they're in, but also the series as a whole. Rachel Lacey did this very well with Run to You. She introduced into the picture future heroes without them encroaching into what the book is really about ... Gabby and Ethan :) And she also intertwined stories like that of Ethan's grandmother into their story that added meaning to their story .. so basically no fluff :) I love that. I love that a lot!!I also LOVE the fake significant other trope, because that always works SO well doesn't it?! lol Let the games begin ... Ethan needs to appease his grandmother and make her feel like he's happy and content and in love with someone. Gabby is going to be that someone. Now Gabby just got out of a bad relationship and has sworn off men and neither of them were looking for HEA .... but we all know how that works :)I have to say that there's nothing really new in the story-line or tropes of this book, but I still enjoyed the heck out of it. Maybe it's because Rachel is a new-to-me author or maybe it's because it's been a while since I read this type of romance, but I had a smile on my face the whole time I read it. From their first meeting to their eventual realization that they were it for each other, I was captivated. I had fun reading it. It warmed my heart. It was sweet. It was everything it was supposed to be. And I like Rachel's voice and style. THAT didn't feel like I'd read before. THAT is what added the wow factor for me.

He kept them in a box in his closet. They didn't define who he was or even the greatest thing he'd accomplished.Dixie was looking at her like she held the keys to the universe. Secrets and lies can destroy a family.My Review:At first glance, Run to You seemed like a simple story, yet - considerable growth and transformation occurred for the characters as they moved from being strangers to pretend partners and into a quasi-relationship. As they became friends and quickly moved into more than friend territory - they dealt with a myriad of concerns including ongoing grief, establishing a new business, confronting inner demons, overcoming personal fears, working through a bucket list, skinny dipping, losing a loved one, and finally opening up to a new romance. The characters were likable and the storyline was emotive, occasionally steamy, easy to follow, and entertaining."}, {"userName": "\u269c\ufe0fTrea", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5223520-trea", "userReview": "I have to say, I really enjoyed this story!

It was my love of rocker romance that caused me to notice the cover of her book, Rock With You. It was a short story and the synopsis intrigued me so I took a chance on a new author. I'm so glad I did. While Run to You is not focused on the rock star, he did show up. And while this cover didn't do anything for me, what's between the pages made up for it. This series seems to be more focused on the town of Haven which is small and remote, and also a good vacation spot. A place known for rest, relaxation and vacation fun. It also seems to be a good place to escape. The locals are a fun and entertaining group and the 'visitors' have been full of secrets and surprises. Enough to keep this series going for a long time.Ethan has been living in Haven since he was 12 yrs old. He was raised by his grandma, Dixie. And let me tell you, Dixie is a mess. She's sweet and sassy and sneaky. She had to be to keep up with a young Ethan and his two best friends, Ryan & Mark. They got into lots of trouble as teenagers and now that they are grown and trying to start a business, they are having a time trying to convince the town that they are mature and responsible adults who know what they are doing. The three friends have put everything into their new business, Off-the-Grid Adventures. Unfortunately, the Town Council is throwing up road blocks and they have their work cut out for them to convince them to approve their zoning permit. Imagine Ethan's surprise when he sees \nher\n for the first time, on his property. He's never seen her before which tells him she's not a local, or he would have noticed her long before now. As he approaches her, he's just in time to witness her disturb a nest of yellowjackets and get stung repeatedly before falling into a stream right in front of him. She's a mess...\nand she's beautiful.\nGabby is hiding out in Haven. She's been there for a while without being noticed. She can work from anywhere as long as she has a computer and internet. So she's managed to escape the notice of the locals until she accidentally trespasses onto the future site of Off-the-Grid. She was just taking a walk, minding her own business, and \nthere he was.\n Meeting a sexy man in the middle of nowhere was not in her plans. Actually, a man is the last thing she wants in her life. However; how can she ignore the helping hand that offers to pull her out of the stream and take her to the clinic to seek medical attention for the excessive number of stings she received? It's not like she needs to worry about him being attracted to her with wet, muddy clothes and red welts all over her face, right? It's a good thing she didn't notice that those clothes kinda became invisible once they got wet, she might have been even more embarrassed and her face would have been even more red. \nBut he noticed...\nOne thing that Ethan learned a long time ago is that you can't hide anything in Haven. His grandmother knew that he had driven Gabby to the clinic before he'd even made it back home. And being the matchmaker that she was, she couldn't resist trying to meddle and bring them together. Dixie has Ethan wrapped around her little finger. He would do anything for his Grams, and she knows it. That's how Ethan & Gabby end up pretending to be in a relationship. He'd rather convince a stranger to be his girlfriend than to disappoint his Grams. She'd rather pretend to have a boyfriend than to really have one. Neither of them want a \nreal\n relationship. So, they end up spending time together so that they can be seen around town, convincing the locals that they are a loving couple. The problem is, it's not so bad. How long will they be able to deny the chemistry that's so strong that everyone around them can feel it?I enjoyed the hell out of this funny, sweet, and very sexy read that enticed me with secrets and surprises. And did I mention that Ethan's two friends, Ryan & Mark, are single and sexy too? I can't wait to see what's in store during my next journey to Haven.

Guess what? It happened again.Just like she did with \u201cUnleashed\u201d, Ms. Lacey gave me exactly what I needed with \u201cRun to You\u201d: sweet and hot small town romance with a likable MC, a trouble but swoon-worthy LI, a romance with great chemistry and a dog. Yep, because dogs are important, and Ms. Lacey seem to love them just as much as I do.Come meet Gabby Winters, the MC who\u2019ll steal your heart because she is a super nice person who just wants to get over a bad relationship but hiding in a the house she rented in a small town. Gabby is that girl-next-door-but-not-really kind of adorable protagonist whom you just can\u2019t help but like. She\u2019s genuinely nice, which I\u2019m starting to think all Rachel Lacey\u2019s protagonists are. This is not a critique, you guys, because writing likable characters is much more difficult than people give writers credit for. Sure sometimes I want to read about girls/women who are a bit unlikable because they\u2019re bold and out-there and all of that, but that\u2019s usually not what I\u2019m looking for when I get my hands on a small-town romance book. The fact that Rachel Lacey can deliver exactly the kind of protagonist readers want from this category/genre is something worth noticing.Another thing this author is really good at is writing soft-alpha LIs. \u201cIs soft-alpha even a thing?\u201d You\u2019re probably asking right now. Well, it is. It\u2019s that guy who\u2019s got a little bit of a caveman in him, maybe a short temper or a tendency to want things done a certain way, but he doesn\u2019t place high in the \u201cJericho Barrons\u201d scale, you know? He\u2019s a bit softer. I love alpha-alpha, only-alpha and soft-alpha; and I loved how \u201cRun to You\u201d brought me Ethan, a man who knew what he wanted in bed (yummy) and out of it, and had a short temper to go with it without coming across as a the-jerk-I-love-to-hate (or hate-to-love).Gabby and Ethan meet when they\u2019re both in need of each other. His grandmother is dying and she wants to see him happy before she passes away, and Gabby\u2019s ex-boyfriend is stalking her, so she needs to show him she\u2019s moved on so he can do the same. Cue to one of my favorite romance tropes: fake relationship.Of course the attraction between Gabby and Ethan has you licking your Kindle and coming back for more (metaphorically, you guys!), so the fake relationship turns real soon enough. When I mean soon enough it means: not too early and not too late. The pacing was just as it needed to me, and I read this in one sitting.I loved, loved everything about this couple. Loved, loved how Ethan inserted Gabby in his life without pushing her. How Gabby started to care for his grandmother, help his friends, make friends of her own.Grandmother, by the way, was a great character. She won me over pretty quickly and I might\u2019ve teared up a few times when she was concerned. Ethan\u2019s love for her was beautiful. Just beautiful. And of course that made him even more likable.I also enjoyed the business idea Ethan and his two friends came up with. It was refreshing and smart. Getting to know Mark and Ryan a little bit was also a plus, because I\u2019m already anxious to read about Ryan\u2019s relationship with Emma (apparently it\u2019ll feature another favorite trope: brother\u2019s BFF) and Mark\u2019s relationship with the spa-lady (a little bit of a second chance romance, plus Mark, who was dark and broody and just my kind of LI).Overall, this was a great, great Sunday read and I\u2019m so happy I got the chance to read another book from Ms. Lacey. It seems like Rachel Lacy is going to join Kelly Eadon in my list of go-to authors for sweet and hot romance novels."}, {"userName": "Francesca the Fierce (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3108364-francesca-the-fierce-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "3.5 Stars\nI was looking forward to starting this series because the prequel gave us a small glimpse into a cute small town (and a group of adorable old ladies that I wanted to get to know better) even though it didn\u2019t really leave us knowing much about the people we would be reading about in the series.RUN TO YOU is that glimpse. We meet three best friends who grew up in foster care for a bit and established a really strong bond since then. Now as adults, they\u2019ve left their successful careers behind and they\u2019ve come back to their small home town to open a business together. All three thrill seekers, they are opening up the first adventure business in town and struggling to make the town accept them. Ethan, the hero in this story, has no place in his life for romance but the only person in his life that matters, his grandmother, has only one wish before she dies. To see him find love and settle down. And she thinks the new girl passing through town, Gabby, is the right woman for him.I\u2019m a fan of the fake girlfriend trope and I think this story had a lot going for it. The hero is super cute and of course it helps that he\u2019s an athlete and a former Olympian who has a few gold medals for swimming. ;) He\u2019s also very down to earth and a simple guy who has a deep love for his grandmother. Big thumbs up on the hero department!Gabby is a unique individual, and I admired that in her. She\u2019s just come out of a bad relationship and she was strong enough to do that and to step away from the easy comfort of her parents who were also keeping her spirit down. She\u2019s gone to another town by herself to find that freedom and she\u2019s definitely succeeding on her own. She\u2019s a successful video game designer, she has a strong view of what she wants in her life and what she thinks she needs to heal.Her plans slightly deviate when she meets sexy Ethan, but I liked that she went with the flow on that instead of staying very rigid with her rules. I think these two had an easy chemistry about them and really complemented each other well.

It\u2019s a story filled with heart, humor, and love. Rachel Lacey has a way of drawing you into the story with her words and humor. And I\u2019m slow and steady becoming a huge fan of hers. Gabby Winters ran to the sleepy town of Haven to escape her past, to find herself, and overcome her fears. While she might not think she\u2019s a strong person, she definitely is stronger than she ever gave herself credit for. After a disastrous previous relationship, Gabby has no intention of giving any man a chance in the near future, regardless of the sizzling chemistry. Yet, her chance encounter with Ethan, and the resulting arrangement, changes that.Ethan Hunter has no intention of ever settling down, not even his grandmother\u2019s wish can change his mind. His tough childhood taught him to be weary of his own temper, and he isn\u2019t going to drag anyone into his issues, no matter his attraction to the person. One lie, told to make his grandmother happy, changes the course of his life. But will he be able to let go of his fears in order to pursue his own happiness?Gabby and Ethan\u2019s relationship, or non-relationship, is a complicated one for sure. While they told a lie and pretend to be in a relationship, it\u2019s becoming all too real, all too fast. While Gabby comes to terms with her feelings for Ethan rather quickly, Ethan keeps fighting his feelings for her. It takes quite a while for him to get his act together, which was the one thing to make this angsty, but also frustrating. They share a sizzling chemistry, a beautiful love for one another, and while they\u2019re not perfect, they\u2019re perfect for each other. Run to You is a story filled with hilarity, a passionate love between two scarred people, an entertaining storyline, and great writing. This was my second Rachel Lacey book, and I think it\u2019s safe to say by now that I\u2019m a fan of her stories and writing. If you\u2019re looking for a sweet, funny, and angsty romance, make sure to check out Run to You and Lacey\u2019s other books. I can only recommend them. *ARC received in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Ann Lorz", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4793102-ann-lorz", "userReview": "I've been really enjoying Rachel Lacey's books. This new series has had me laughing right away. Run to You starts off with Gabby being stung by bee's. Now in real life that wouldn't be funny at all, but let's remember, this isn't real life. Right away you will just crack up and enjoy how both Gabby and Ethan meet. It might not have seemed romantic but in it's way it is. Ethan rushes to help her, how romantic is that! Gabby is basically hiding out in the woods, trying to get her life together after a very bad break up. You understand right away how she's feeling. We've all had that person in our lives that wouldn't take no for a answer. I love how Ethan and his friend have come home to make something of themselves, or I should say remake since they've all done great for themselves out of their home town. They all feel they need to make up for how crazy they were as kids. Right away you'll enjoy their friendship. I wish we had more of it in the book. Yes, the story is about about Ethan and Gabby but the series is about the guys. I would have liked a few moments from their childhood. Hopefully in the next books you'll get more.I even enjoyed the idea of them (Gabby & Ethan) faking a relationship to make Ethan's grandmother happy. You can see how they fall for each other. It isn't always a easy ride but I had fun with them.The reason I put the warning in is because I hate to ruin things for others so I will leave it up to you if you want to know or not. Not it's really not that huge of a give away, but it does take over the story a little. Spoiler In the story Ethan's grandmother finds out she's dying and for me it took over the story. I kept waiting with each turn of the page for her to die. I know this might sound silly to some, but it was tough to read for me. I am glad that Lacey didn't at the last minute find some big cure. She went with real life and that I could appreciate.

Plus who doesn't love a sassy Gram.2. Fake relationship trope: \u00a0To make Gram happy, Ethan borrows Gabby to be his fake girlfriend, which of course leads to many a cute moments and a romance that might be more real than they ever thought.If this were a real date, you would so be getting luck tonight.3. Bromance: The trio of Ethan, Ryan and Mark. I love seeing these guys who are like brothers to each other work together to achieve their dreams.4. A(n adorable) man talking to a (cowardly) dog:But a sound drew her towards the kitchen, where she found Ethan sitting on the floor, a package of pepperoni in his left hand, his right extended toward the pantry.\"So tell me,\" he said in a conversational voice, and goodness, he must be talking to Lance. She stayed back a moment to watch mesmerized. \"What do you and Gabby do all day? Do you get to sit in her lap? I might be a little jealous about that, bro.\"Overall a easy breezy cute romance. Ethan and Gabby are sweet together. And even though Gabby drove me nuts with her indecisiveness and insecurities, she does finally work it out in the end and gets a backbone! I love the small town feel and the secondary characters are great. Looking forward to more cute times in Haven.\"Come on now, admit it.

We meet three best friends who grew up in foster care for a bit and established a really strong bond since then. Now as adults, they've left their successful careers behind and they've come back to their small home town to open a business together. All three thrill seekers, they are opening up the first adventure business in town and struggling to make the town accept them. Ethan, the hero in this story, has no place in his life for romance but the only person in his life that matters, his grandmother, has only one wish before she dies. To see him find love and settle down. And she thinks the new girl passing through town, Gabby, is the right woman for him.I'm a fan of the fake girlfriend trope and I think this story had a lot going for it. The hero is super cute and of course it helps that he's an athlete and a former Olympian who has a few gold medals for swimming. ;) He's also very down to earth and a simple guy who has a deep love for his grandmother. Big thumbs up on the hero department! Gabby is a unique individual, and I admired that in her. She's just come out of a bad relationship and she was strong enough to do that and to step away from the easy comfort of her parents who were also keeping her spirit down. She's gone to another town by herself to find that freedom and she's definitely succeeding on her own. She's a successful video game designer, she has a strong view of what she wants in her life and what she thinks she needs to heal. Her plans slightly deviate when she meets sexy Ethan, but I liked that she went with the flow on that instead of staying very rigid with her rules. I think these two had an easy chemistry about them and really complemented each other well. But overall, I think the story was missing a little extra something as it seemed to start to drag a bit at about the half way point.I loved the concept of this series and the men (and their heroines) we are introduced to in this story.

His beloved grandmother has a bucket list of wishes before she leaves this world \u2013 and one of those items to be ticked off is seeing Ethan happily settled with the right woman\u2026 maybe that new girl in town, Gabby, she seems to be perfect for the task.Oh, there\u2019s definitely sparks and interest between Ethan and Gabby right from their first meeting. But can they live a huge fib for the sake of granting one dying woman her fondest wish\u2026 it might be crazy, but it\u2019s really an easy answer.Run To You is full of plotting townsfolk, a wonderfully loving grandmother and two wounded people who never thought they\u2019d find that right person for them\u2026 ever. Gabby and Ethan both have wounds from their pasts, issues that need dealing with and hearts that have been battered. Their romance moved easily from crazy first meeting, to an attraction each would deny, to friendship, co-conspirators and eventually realizing that this role they\u2019ve been playing for the sake of one special woman has become reality in every sense of the word.I enjoyed this one so much. What we do for love often has more results than we\u2019d planned on. Ethan and Gabby are fun, charming people who had to face their past and discover that love can exist for them. I liked them together and individually, even if they made some temporary choices that I could have sat them down for a stern talking to\u2026 hey, don\u2019t you talk to characters too? *grin* I know, they never listen to me either.If you\u2019re in the mood to visit a small town with all it\u2019s quirky residents, discover that love beats all and simply enjoy a good, solid romance \u2013 then have I got a book for you.

For Ethan he is dealing with \"trying to get his Off the Grid Adventures business off the ground, finding out that his grandmother has an aneurysm that could burst at anytime, and the baggage of having an abusive father who ended up killing his mother.\"What brings these two together was Gabby the attack by hornets and Ethan rescued her.
