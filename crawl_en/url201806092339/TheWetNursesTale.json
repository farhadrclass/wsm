Their main purpose is for feedin' the young'uns.

When her second babe is snatched away and placed in the home of a mad woman, Susan devises a plan to be reunited with her son and protect him from harm.Susan is a great character. I can't imagine anyone NOT liking her. A healthy, hefty, big-boned gal, she realizes that her job is somewhat odd, but necessary.

When Susan, in service at the manor house, finds herself pregnant by the master's son, she is forced by her father into following in her mother's footsteps, only a few weeks after the birth of her son. Erica Eisendorfer, in a remarkable first novel, has produced a work of originality, interest, and intelligence. No \"English rose\", Susan is a spirited, strapping young woman with no formal education but a deal of common sense, optimism, and sheer grit. Her story begins slowly enough, but by the halfway point, the suspense kicks in and makes it un-put down-able. Susan Rose is a most unconventional heroine, but heroine she most definitely is. Interspersed with Susan's tale are brief vignettes narrated by the mothers of her many charges, explaining just how it came to pass that they were in need of her vital services. Now the reader sees both sides of the situation, which by contemporary standards is a rather peculiar one. The author tempers what could be a bleak topic (racism, classism, and sexism) with touches of humor and joy.

Normally I reserve my 5-star ratings to books that I consider an all-time favorite and would read again, but this book is not one of them!!! However, I think I've read too many books lately that have just been OK or had endings that I did not like! But, woo hoo, this fantastic tale did have a great ending and I was just SO happy that I felt compelled to give it my highest rating (normally would have given this book 4 stars, no, probably 4.5!!!)! This was a superbly written, utterly fascinating look into the world of wet nursing during Victorian times, but Susan Rose is far from the typical Victorian heroine! Following in her mother's footsteps in the wet nurse profession, she strays far from her mother's morals to do whatever it takes to protect herself and her son, which leads to a lot of mistakes, tragedy and heart breaking choices that Ms. Rose makes no excuses for. But, far from being a dark and depressing story, hers is full of gumption, determination and hope for a happy ending; which she ultimately achieves and fully deserves! But, why would I not read this story again? I must say that even though I do love it, and the author did a superb job writing about it, there is just no delicate way to address the subject matter of sex, childbirth and nursing or about having to accept, but do ultimately forgive, Susan Rose's \"that is that\" decisions. Overall, it is a story best read once, but I do highly recommend it, especially if you're a mother herself, and it's definitely the type of book that would make for a great book club reading discussion!!"}, {"userName": "Jake Rideout", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2518097-jake-rideout", "userReview": "Susan Rose's mother is a wet nurse, whose profession is to feed and care for other women's babies until they can be weaned and returned home. Susan's father is a drunk who is always looking for ways to earn an extra shilling. When Susan gives birth to a baby and a desperate mother calls for a wet nurse, Susan finds herself sold to the highest bidder. This is the story of a smart, plucky, adventurous lower-class woman in Victorian England, and it is everything a reader wants in a historical novel.

Not since Jayne Mansfield have breasts done so much for a career.I did pick this book up on purpose. Am I expecting? No. Am I contemplating a career change? Yes, but nothing in the diary field. I had made a note of The Wet Nurse when the hardcover came out that I wanted to take a look when the paperback was released. It was, I did and I purchased. Why? Historical interest. It certainly was not this dreadful cover that tempted me. Take a look at that. It makes those God-awful covers on the Barnes and Noble Classics look attractive. After a lifetime's worth of reading historical fiction and 19th century writers like Dickens, Trollope, Collins, Oliphant, Gaskell, etc I knew what a wet nurse was but that was all I knew. The wet nurse is an unexamined staple of period novels. Typically even the second upstairs parlor maid will have more character development and plot importance than the wet nurse. Sue me I was curious. My attitude is the give away that I did not expect to...well, respect this novel. I assumed from the cover, the subject matter and the prosaic title that I would get a few facts on milk production as a livelihood, average writing and maybe some entertainment. Why? What was it about a novel whose main character lactates for a living that made me prejudge ? Am I a snob? Am I just the tiniest bit disappointed that I enjoyed The Wet Nurse from end to end? Absolutely not. My snottiness was defeated. Author Erica Eisdorfer has done a very good job. Her main character, Susan Rose, is an illiterate country girl forced to go to London to hunt down her missing son. She is able to get a position in a household and is soon given the opportunity to better her salary by becoming the wet nurse. Susan is what Dickens would have described as a 'jolly' girl. My Mom would have said that she was no better than she should have been. She is good hearted, lusty and true but not above scheming and larceny to get ahead and recover her son. You know that if Susan is going to earn herself a happy ending she will have more than her share of adventures, heartache, horrifying employers and brutality to endure. Susan is the strength of this book, not the plot.At the end of each chapter is a somewhat abrupt interruption of the story while Susan's clients explain why she was needed in each job. These were my favorite parts of the novel. As informative as these sections were they also help the novel. They add a little balance to the story by bringing in a touch of Upstairs Downstairs to the book and with each explanation Eisdorfer brought a subtle reminder to us about how difficult surviving Victorian England was for adults and children. They also served to reinforce our view of Susan's independence and resilience. The Wet Nurse defied my snobby this-will-be-all-cheese expectations and lived up to my desire for knowledge."}, {"userName": "Aarti", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149420-aarti", "userReview": "Erica Eisdorfer nails the Victorian era. She is on top of the class divide, the race divide and the gender divide. Her main character, Susan Rose, speaks in a working-class dialect that is neither stilted nor affected. I value this highly as it is a nuance that something many authors cannot master. Eisdorfer also introduces some characters only for the brief spell of one or two pages, each one sharing his or her reasons for hiring a wet nurse. These people, too, come alive off the page and you get to know their personalities very well, even if you only interact with them for two pages. I really enjoyed these vignettes that Eisdorfer put in at the end of every chapter. They were fun to read and would sometimes be alluded to later in the story as well. In fact, I feel certain that one of the vignettes has a large bearing on the end of the story, only I can't quite put my finger on how the two are connected. I will have to mull over that some more.Susan, though, steals the show. She is so wonderfully real and easy to identify with. She does not beg for sympathy from anyone, and does not have stupid affectations to get attention. Susan isn't the most fabulous and exciting woman in literature. But she sets her mind on a goal and goes for it, and one can't help admiring a woman for that.The only quibble I had with this book was its unexpected plunge into a somewhat Gothic storyline. I did not see that coming at all, from the start, and the book was a bit darker than I expected because of it. But the story is compelling and plausible, and Eisdorfer knows her Victorians. I'd highly recommend the book to any fans of historical fiction!"}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/849475-barb", "userReview": "I picked this up at a book sale somewhere and promptly put it on the bottom of the pile to be read and mostly forgotten about.

But in the end, it's not a book I'd recommend. As far as plot goes, I felt like it had some real merit. The character was likeable and I sympathized with many of her plights. The first half of the book seemed to spend too much time in the realm of romance novels -- not even love, just the talk of how women became pregnant. There were small sections interspersed called 'Mrs. ______'s reason'; they were the many different situations and reasons that caused a woman to look for a wet nurse. I thought this could've been really interesting, but I would've rather heard them in connection to the plot. As it was, they had tenuous strings to our plot. I didn't understand why that idea wasn't better connected to the babies who were being nursed. The second half of the novel, the plot picked up and became really interesting. But I felt like the whole plot could've been left to itself, and too much time was devoted to how the character got pregnant in the first place.

I liked learning about how life may have been like for poor women who worked by nursing other women's babies.One thing I really LIKED about the book was that they talked a great deal about death. So many women and babies died in childbirth.

I enjoyed that the story came from the perspective of someone of the lower classes who had to \"do for herself.\" I loved much of the humor in her thoughts, basically along the lines that rich people worry about crazy things that poor people don't have time to think about and that the rich make the messses and the poor have to clean them up. Susan is practical and does what she needs to do to survive. Her values are based on her own moral compass, rather than the religious and social morals of Victorian England. She decided that she would rather have male companionship than to be an old spinster who never experienced any joy. Instead of being shamed to be an unwed mother, she welcomed the baby as something to bring some joy into her life. Susan Rose is not a woman who follows anyone's whims but her own. The author paints social problems (female servants expected to submit to the master of the house, Susan being beaten by her father, etc.) in a way that just made them matter-of-fact, the dangers of the times. Which, for someone of her class, was a part of everyday life. I liked the realism contained in the book, even if I didn't like some of the acts. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and zoomed through it in one day!I learned a little piece of history that I had not known before. I had always thought wet nurses nursed babies who mothers could not produce milk, were sick with childbirth fever or whose mothers had died. I found through my reading that some were farm wives who were needed to help with the harvets and some were wives of merchants who helped run the store. Wet nurses also nursed the babies of high society women who found nursing their own babies to be \"unfashionable\" because it would keep the wife tied to the baby and unable to attend parties, balls, dinners, etc. I had previously assumed that the aversion to breastfeeding had started in the US, in the early 1900's, with the invention of baby formula. But, apparently it started in Victorian England with the upper crust. Or maybe even before that? I don't know but think it is an interesting subject."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045491-lauren", "userReview": "The Wet Nurse's Tale is a plot driven historical fiction novel about Susan Rose, the witty, illiterate daughter of a wet nurse who works as a maid in the \"Great House\" in her village. Susan follows in her mother's footsteps and becomes a wet nurse herself after several pantry dalliances with the young son of her employers. The first part of the novel describes how Susan became a nurse and follows her from home to home as she nurses the babies of others at the expense of her own son Joey. The second part of the novel involves Susan's second son and her quest to retrieve him from London gentry after the baby is removed from Susan's home without her knowledge. This portion of the novel is a gothic storyline, reminiscent of a low brow Bronte plot. Through it all, Susan narrates with good spirits, country crassness, and commn sense. Although illiterate, Susan is clearly knowledgeable of class relations, family dynamics, and basic human nature. This novel is very well done. The novel is told in the first person; Susan's narration is punctuated with 19th century slang. Each chapeter in the novel is followed by a two page story of a woman (or in one case a man) who paid a wet nurse to feed her child. This feature, though interesting, interrupted the flow of the story. The novel, though historical fiction, is light on history per se, but largely revolves around the social relationships of the time. There are only a handful of cues about the time period in which the novel is set - travel is done by coaches (for the poor) or trains (for the rich) and Benjamin Disraeli is mentioned. Ultimately, the time period doesn't matter - the story is timeless, meaning that it could have taken place any time from the middle ages through the early twentieth century."}, {"userName": "Colleen Turner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3339335-colleen-turner", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this! It was refreshing to read a book with a character so open, real and raw that you cannot help but feel for her at every turn. When Susan Rose's heart bleeds yours does right along with her. And when she triumphs, no matter how small, you cheer for her every step of the way. She is not perfect, as none of us are, but she is caring, strong and tough as nails when it comes to those she loves dearly.Susan Rose is a young, large woman working in the Great House of her town along with some of her many siblings.

When the lonely, odd son of the Great House seeks comfort in Susan's embrace, her future is set on a course with some happiness and much heart break.

Susan Rose is young woman from a poor family who knows her own mind and is tough as nails. Sent to work in the great house near their village, Susan and her sisters toil away for the wealthy family, ever mindful of the customs and cultural restraints of the day, until Susan is approached by the awkward young Master of the house, and her life is forever changed in many ways.This is really a novel about nursing. Interestingly, in today's culture, the very thought of giving one's own child over to a wet nurse for nurturing and feeding would be considered pretty out of the norm (as sadly, nursing itself sometimes is). But in Victorian England, before baby bottles and formula, women of all standings entrusted their infants to working class women who were hired out for specifically that purpose. These wet nurses sometimes nursed a succession of children for many years. I loved the author's writing, giving Susan a voice that is both raucous and funny, as well as tender and sweet. Susan is an observant narrator, telling us all about her experiences and thoughts on them, from visiting the Jewish temple for worship, to watching a new mother deeply in love with their child.

Her mother was a wet nurse, and it seems only natural that she take up that line of work following her first pregnancy. Her tale is interspersed with accounts of those who hired her mother or Rose to feed their babies; through these vignettes we see the many different reasons for employing wet nurses, ranging from the vain who didn't want to ruin their figures to those who felt that sending their infants to live in the country for their first few months would be healthier than keeping them in the city, and including the infant whose mother died in childbirth, and the mother who had twins but not enough milk for two.

It is historical fiction with a bit of romance thrown in. There is also some very sad parts and a bit of raunchy parts....all very \"british like\". There was lot of sound breastfeeding information but she threw enough \"old wives tales\" in to make it believable. The book is narrated by the main character but in between chapters tell stories of women who have given their babies to wet nurses and their reasons for doing so. I don't think it would be everyone's cup of tea but I thoroughly enjoyed this book."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5161074-rebecca", "userReview": "What a ripper of a read! It had me from the very first sentence, and when you're picking a book up to read in ad breaks whilst watching the telly, you know it must be good!This is Susan Rose's tale of her life as a wet nurse and her character and voice could not be any richer. Narrated in conversational style, I could just imagine Susan's broad northern England accent telling me her tale in the friendliest voice. I loved this story and highly recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2548498-michele", "userReview": "Susan Rose is a wet nurse for wealthy Victorian clients.

It's steeped in careful personal and cultural detail (clearly the author did loads of research), but always stays pretty light."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/402125-leslie", "userReview": "I read a lot of press about this book before its Aug 6th release date and the press was right - WONDERFUL!

The narrator Susan Rose is quite charming and entertaining. If you like PBS period dramas and books like Sarah Waters' Fingersmith (and babies/boobs), then you'd probably enjoy this as well."}], "description": "Bright and clever with a sharp-tongued, adventurous heroine who offers a candid and often funny look at the business of nursing babies in Victorian England, this is a debut novel that will have everyone talking.Susan Rose isn't the average protagonist: she's scheming, promiscuous, plump, and she is also smart, funny, tender, and entirely lovable. Like many lower-class women of Victorian England, she was born into a world that offered very few opportunities for the poor and unlovely. But Susan is the kind of plucky heroine who seeks her fortune, and finds it . . . with some help from, well, her breasts. Susan, you see, is a professional wet nurse; she breast-feeds the children of wealthy women who can't or won't nurse their own babies.But when her own child is sold by her father and sent to a London lady who had recently lost a baby, Susan manages to convince his new foster mother, Mrs. Norbert, to hire her as a wet nurse. Once reunited with her son, Susan discovers the Norbert home to be a much more sinister place than she'd ever expected. Dark and full of secrets, its master is in India, and the first baby who died there did so under very mysterious circumstances. Susan embarks on a terrifying journey to rescue her son before he meets the same fate.", "title": "The Wet Nurse's Tale", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6006802-the-wet-nurse-s-tale", "average": 3.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348397118l/6006802.jpg", "reviews": 448, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/476271.Erica_Eisdorfer", "name": "Erica Eisdorfer"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Historical", "European Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6006802-the-wet-nurse-s-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7047965-the-wet-nurse-s-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17213298-the-wet-nurse-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/934403.Carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12352782-27-views-of-chapel-hill", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
