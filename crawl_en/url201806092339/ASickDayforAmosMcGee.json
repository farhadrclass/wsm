This is destined to be a classic. It is a soft, gentle story of friendship between a kindly zookeeper and his animal friends. Beautifully illustrated, every page contains subtleties in it's classically-rendered scenes. There is a softness that translates in every image, a kindness in every creature and this is not lost on my children.

Stead's A Sick Day for Amos McGee is sweetly and basically a glowing and softly intense tale of friendship (between zookeeper Amos McGee and a diverse group of zoo animals) and that the most simple acts of kindness, of sweetness and understanding are often, are usually the most healing, and sustaining (while confined at home and in bed due to a nasty flu-like cold, Amos McGee almost immediately begins to rally and feel better when his zoo animal friends visit to cheer him up, not with medicines, not with health care advice, but with games of cards and simply being there for him during his hours of need, during his sick day). And truth be told, I am actually rather pleasantly surprised at how much I have both enjoyed A Sick Day for Amos McGee and appreciated the sweet but delicately, lovingly presented messages of the importance of friendship, of being there for others, of reciprocating care and support by providing your own if/when required, even if this is not specifically being demanded, being asked for (mostly due to the fact that A Sick Day for Amos McGee is a story about a zookeeper and the zoo animals under his care, as more often than not, stories about zoos do tend to rub me the proverbially wrong way). Text and images work marvellously and gracefully together like a beautifully spinning and well oiled machine (both Philip C. Stead's caressingly gentle narrative and Erin E. Stead's simple but minutely expressive accompanying illustrations perform a joyous dance and celebration of friendship and of knowing what friends and acquaintances desire and require to be cheered, to be content, to be helped and sustained). Most highly recommended, and definitely a worthy recipient of the Caldecott Medal it was awarded, A Sick Day for Amos McGee is a sweet read for any time, but is due to its themes and contents also a perfect pick-me-up during times of flu and cold like illnesses, during times of affliction, and of course always a glowing paean to friendship in all its diverse forms and manifestations."}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221050-betsy", "userReview": "Sometimes children\u2019s book reviewers bandy about the term \u201cclassic\u201d like it was a verbal shuttlecock. There\u2019s nothing that raises the savvy readers\u2019 eyebrows faster than to see some wordsmith drooling profusely over \u201ca new classic\u201d or a book merely \u201cdestined to become a classic\u201d. Even worse is when they start calling a book \u201cold-fashioned\u201d. Nine times out of then what they\u2019re talking about is the fact that the book parrots some picture book title of the past. That\u2019s the crazy thing about A Sick Day for Amos McGee. It doesn\u2019t parrot anyone, and when you read it you feel like you\u2019ve know the book your whole life. Could have been written last year, ten years ago, or fifty. Doesn\u2019t matter because the word \u201ctimeless\u201d may as well be stamped all over each and every doggone page. If you want to give a child a book that will remain with them always (and lead to decades of folks growing up and desperately trying to relocate it with the children\u2019s librarians of the future) this is the one that you want. Marvelous.Each morning it\u2019s the same. Amos McGee gets out of bed, puts on his uniform, and goes to his job as zookeeper in the City Zoo. Amos takes his job very seriously. He always makes sure to play chess with the elephant, run races with the tortoise, sit quietly with the penguin, blow the rhino\u2019s runny nose, and tell stories to the owl at dusk. Then one day Amos wakes up sick and has to stay in bed. The animals, bereft of his presence, decide something must be done. So they pick themselves up and take the bus to Amos\u2019s house to keep him company for a change. And after everyone helps him out, Amos reads them all a story and each one of them tucks in for the night.It\u2019s strange to think that author Philip Stead wrote both this and last year\u2019s Creamed Tuna Fish and Peas on Toast. Not that the latter was a bad book or anything, mind you, but that was a case where the protagonist had to be a perpetual crankypants. The character of Amos simply couldn\u2019t be more different. He's like a cross between your favorite grandpa and Mr. Rogers. I read through this book several times to get down the cadence of Mr. Stead\u2019s wordplay too. He\u2019s prone to terms like \u201camble\u201d. He parallels Amos\u2019s activities in the first half with similar activities with the animals are taking care of him in the second. He knows when to leave sections wordless. And at the end, the \u201cgoodnight\u201d section sort of makes this an ideal bedtime book for small fry. Practically invokes Goodnight Moon it does.There\u2019s definitely a Sebastian Meschenmoser quality to this book (a statement that is going to be understood by approximately three people out there). Meschenmoser is a German illustrator who has written titles like Learning to Fly and Waiting for Winter. Erin Stead\u2019s style is similar partly because there is a common humanity to every animal she draws. It\u2019s not just the anthropomorphic details, like a penguin in socks (an animal Meschenmoser shares an affection for). It\u2019s deeper than that. Look at this cover and then stare deep into that elephant\u2019s eyes. There are layers to that elephant. That elephant has seen things in its day and has come out the wiser for it. It could tell you stories that would curl your hair or make you laugh till it hurt. That\u2019s what I see when I look at a Stead animal. I see a creature that has had a rich full life, and all because of how she has chosen to put pencil/woodblock to paper. Amos McGee himself could not be any better. You love him from the moment he stretches in his pajamas. Everyone here, from the owl to the tortoise is someone you believe in. Add onto all that the little tiny details as well. How Amos and the penguin sit and stand together, ankles turned inward. The fate of the penguin\u2019s red balloon. Where Mr. McGee\u2019s teddy bear is at any given time. The portrait of the penguin in the home. The rabbit reading a newspaper on the bus. And then there\u2019s the penultimate spread where the animals gather around Amos as he gets ready to go to bed. His left foot rest gently against the rhino\u2019s nose, his left hand on the elephant\u2019s trunk. Very simple, natural, affectionate touches. You notice them, but you don\u2019t. That\u2019s the charm.So there's the content. Now look at the actual art and design. According to the bookflap, Erin creates her illustrations by hand using woodblock printing techniques and pencil.\u201d That\u2019s impressive in and of itself, but I think the use of color is fascinating. Ms. Stead is sparing. On the one hand, you\u2019re never able to identify the book\u2019s exact year. On the other, you know in the back of your brain that if the publisher wanted to use all the colors of the rainbow, they could. You could also read the book several times before you noticed the elaborate flower design that ties the horizon in place behind the runny nosed rhino. Little touches, but necessary.Husband and wife author/illustrator teams emerge once in a while, but they don\u2019t always have the golden touch. That the Steads not only have it but are also willing to use it as a force for good instead of evil is gratifying. It\u2019s also gratifying to think that maybe we\u2019ll see them do more books in the future. I\u2019d like that. I\u2019d like that very much, and I\u2019m wagering that a whole generation of children reading and loving this book are going to like it as well. Here, I\u2019ll make it simple for you: Need to buy a picture book for a kid between the ages of four and eight? Buy this one. There you go.

The illustrations are so sweet, and have an old fashioned feel about them that I enjoyed. I love the art style; I enjoyed all the illustrations.Although there is a lot of humor, this is a very quiet story.

I think it's got a glorious \"classic\" feel in both the illustrations and the text; it is just so gentle and yet full of humor and imagination and good-heartedness and fun. Amos McGee is the sort of old man that I admire so deeply; one who has taken his old years as a blessing rather than a curse and who shares his time and his wisdom and kind heart with others. In this case, he works at a zoo and spends time with each animal there, getting to know their personalities and interacting with them in ways that they find mutually beneficial. But when Amos is too sick to come to work one day, the animals find a special way to help him feel better. I read this book while I was sick with a nasty post-Christmas cold and it cheered me no end. Created by a husband and wife team (be sure to check out the sooo cute dedication page) this book is definitely one of my favorites of 2010 and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet, gentle, humorous story about friendship."}, {"userName": "LindaJ^", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4999879-lindaj", "userReview": "I bought this book as a gift for a youngster.

I love stories for children where older characters retain a child-like quality of bonhomie and easy camaraderie. Amos has both which makes him irresistible to me. The structure of this book is really comforting too, a there and back again plot where the protagonist goes on a journey wherein the reader is introduced to everyone worth knowing and then they are separated but not for long because as one person can bring joy to others throughout their day, so too can a group of friends unite to bring one special person comfort and pleasure together! This is that sort of book. See above for an interior view of the book from publisher, Roaring Broook's site. The way award winning illustrator Erin Stead makes her pictures is the icing on the cake: a labor intensive process of block printing the backdrops & major features before completing detailed illustrations on top of them. She describes and illustrates her process really wonderfully in her blog. I still think The Today Show is SICK breaking with tradition and having Snooki on instead of this year's Caldecott and Newbery award winners. But I must confess I have never watched that show, so eventually I should get over it (after a few more healthy rants). If it had been an important show, like say Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom, or a Columbo Rerun, or maybe The Beekman Boys I might have more to bitch about? But the principle of the scheduling choice is still kind of irritating!

I think this picture book falls under one of the levels of illustration which is symmetry. The reader can find themselves enjoying reading this book. I think this would be appropriate for 1st and 2nd graders because it\u2019s easy to understand for them. The story begins with Amos, an elderly, who works at the zoo. Throughout the day Amos went through a routine; from waking up,to taking the bus to work, and making a quick stop to see his friends. His friends are the elephant, the turtle, the penguin, the rhinoceros, and the owl. Amos spent quality time with them either by playing a game or providing his company.

It has a gentle humor, a sweetness and an inherent loveliness that really makes it special.Amos McGee got up early every morning, changed into his uniform, and headed to work at the City Zoo. Even though he had a busy work schedule, he always had time to visit his friends. He played chess with the elephant, ran races with the tortoise, sat quietly with the shy penguin, wiped the rhino\u2019s runny nose, and read books to the owl who was afraid of the dark. But one morning, Amos woke up and didn\u2019t feel well enough to go to the zoo. His friends waited for him, but when Amos didn\u2019t come they set out to visit him instead. The elephant played chess with him. The turtle played hide and seek instead of running races. The penguin kept Amos\u2019 feet warm. The rhino always had a handkerchief ready when Amos sneezed. And at bedtime, the owl read them all a book.The husband and wife team who created this book really worked well together. Philip\u2019s tone of writing has a gentle feel that matches his wife\u2019s art perfectly. Philip\u2019s writing is very readable and works well aloud. The small touches of detail make the world more convincing, including the elephant taking a lot of time to make his move in chess and the spoonfuls of sugar Amos uses at breakfast. It is these little facts that really invite one to linger longer in the book.Erin\u2019s art is delightfully realistic for such a fantastical story. The animals are very true to life except for their hobbies. I especially enjoyed Erin\u2019s two-page wordless spreads as the animals head to Amos\u2019 home. Again with her art, the small touches add so much: the elephant lining up his chess pieces while waiting for Amos and the socks on the feet of the penguin. Small details but very important to the tone and feel of the book.Highly recommended, this book will be embraced by all who read it. Share it for units on zoos or colds. Now all I need to find is a shy penguin to keep my feet warm\u2026Appropriate for ages 3-6."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58584184-jennifer", "userReview": "CaldecottI love the friendship between Amos and his animals. He gives all of himself to them every day, being exactly what they need. \"He always made time to visit his good friends.\" He was exactly what each needed, nurturing for the rhinoceros, a friend to the shy penguin, mental stimulation for the elephant, and physical activity for the tortoise. It's a bit odd that he reads a bedtime story to the owl who is afraid of the dark. Even my Kindergartners know that owls are nocturnal and wake up to do all of their hunting at night. This might lead to an unnecessary explanation of how animals in captivity adapt to non-natural habits and alternative lifestyles (See, \"It Takes Two To Tango\").The intentionally left blank pages allow for extra pauses and for inferring and synthesizing of the story so far. The colors are light and the drawings aren't overly detailed so they add to the story without taking anything away from the words. The moral of the story is to be the kind of friend you would want to have. Or maybe it's to take care of your friends when you can and they'll take care of you when you need them.

I had run a mock Caldecott unit with my third grade class, and this book wasn\u2019t even on our radar enough to put on our ballots. I had some definite favorites that year, both for the Caldecott Medal and for timeless books I wanted to make sure I bought for my own children (Art & Max; City Dog, Country Frog; Ballet For Martha; Mirror Mirror; It\u2019s a Book; Ubiquitous), and I was initially crushed when some of those favorites weren\u2019t recognized at the ALA awards\u2026 Until I went to the bookstore that afternoon, bought A Sick Day for Amos McGee, and realized how amazing it was.\u2028\u2028Though Philip Stead had published one book previously, A Sick Day for Amos McGee was his wife Erin\u2019s first illustrated book\u2026 and both newbies hit the nail squarely on the head with this charming, timeless book. Amos McGee, zookeeper who will remind adults of Mr. Rogers, is one of the more endearing book characters I can think of. He wakes early each morning, greets even the items around his house and the bus driver, and is extraordinarily devoted to the animals at his zoo. He knows each one intimately, taking care to make them feel comfortable and loved. Until, one day\u2026 Amos McGee gets sick. Amos\u2019s tenderness with his animal friends is reflected in the worry they feel about him and the actions they take to ensure that he too feels comfortable and loved. This is the kind of story that makes children and adults alike want to treat their friends and loved ones the same way Amos McGee does.And the illustrations! Erin\u2019s pencil and woodblock prints are done with minimal, reserved color, but are full of details that render each reading of those story new and exciting. I didn\u2019t notice the repeated inclusion of a red balloon, tiny bird, and mouse until the fourth or fifth time that I read the book! Tiny details aside, Erin\u2019s sketches allow the sweet, caring personalities of each character to show through. Readers feel genuinely concerned about the rhino with a runny nose, depicted with constant concern or worry on his face reflecting just how sick he feels, and compassionate toward the shy penguin, drawn with his wings and toes pointed in, as if he\u2019s trying to curl up small enough to go unnoticed.Philip and Erin Stead, thank you for this book. A story of the kindest of friends, timeless illustrations leaving you with more with every reading\u2026 It was an instant favorite with my room full of third graders, and it is now a favorite with my own children (2 and 4.5). Publishers recommend this for ages 4-8, but it can definitely be enjoyed younger and likely older too! If you If you loved A Sick Day for Amos McGee, check out Bear Has a Story To Tell, the duo\u2019s second collaboration together.

I wasn't certain what my reaction would be to this book, but I ended up loving it. It's a tale of friendship. Amos McGee is a creature of habit. Each day at the zoo, he visits his friends. He plays chess with the elephant, gives a tissue to the rhino and reads stories to the owl and so on. One day, he gets sick and stays home. His friends miss him and decide to take action.What I love is that Amos McGee probably doesn't think he is doing much...he has a routine that he follows and he lives a simple life. And yet, it is clear that he is making the lives of each of his unique, diverse friends better through his simple acts of kindness and concern and by meeting each of their unique needs. I think there are a number of reasons this touched me. First, sometimes I feel like my quiet little life doesn't have the power to change the world...I'm no Ghandi or MLK Jr. or Mother Teresa. But I think this book relates to something Mother Teresa said: \"If you can't feed a hundred people, then feed just one.\" Amos McGee didn't do anything grand, but he did show kindness and concern for those he came in contact with. I can do that too. Second, his friends are a diverse bunch. Now while I recognize that his friends are animals, they are a diverse bunch. It's a nice reminder that we can be friends with people of a variety of backgrounds. (And oh, how our world needs that!!) And finally, as a teacher, we seem to be talking a lot about equity in our school/district. My favorite definition of equity is not making everything equal but providing what each child needs to be successful. And that is what Amos does...he provides what each animal needs to be healthy/happy. I love this! (It's always possible that I am reading much more into this than the author's intent...I've spent the week preparing for a new school year and between that and recent events in the news, I have had lots brewing in my head which probably affected my interpretation.)"}, {"userName": "AgnesO", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66226838-agneso", "userReview": "A Sick Day for Amos McGee is a Caldecott Award picture book written by Philip C. Stead and illustrated by Erin E. Stead. I selected this book from the ALSC website. A Sick Day for Amos McGee evokes emotions of warmth and sympathy. In particular, Amos McGee, the main character, is a dedicated zookeeper with regular routines. Despite his duties at the zoo, Amos always makes time for his animal friends. He enjoys playing chess with the elephant, running races with the tortoise, and reading stories to the owl. Consequently, the animals are attached to Amos; thus, when he wakes up sick and cannot go to work one day, the story is reversed as the animals decide to do something extraordinary\u2026The profound theme in A Sick Day for Amos McGee reveals some of the essential qualities of friendship, including kindness, mutual caring, and altruism. The interactions between Amos and the zoo animals confirm that their friendship is truly genuine. Amos is a responsible and faithful character; he is motivated by pure compassion. Amos is simply charming. The story is told through simple text. The plot is intriguing and entertaining, and it keeps the reader engaged. The illustrations are gentle adding warmth to this beautiful picture book. The illustrator skillfully used woodblock prints to add soft color to the pencil drawings and, as a result, brought the characters to life and made each page visually appealing. The wordless pages create a pleasant balance allowing the illustrations to narrate the story. I would implement A Sick Day for Amos McGee in the primary grades as a read aloud to reflect on the nature of friendship as well as the importance of responsibility. In particular, book activities can engage students in retelling, sequencing events, investigating how illustrations create emotional impact on the reader and extend the story, making text-to-self connections, differentiating between fact and fiction, as well as identifying story structures. Because the characters in this picture book are animals, students can identify and classify the different types of zoo animals and explore the role of a zookeeper."}, {"userName": "Emily Arrant", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70891398-emily-arrant", "userReview": "Summary: This is a picture book about friendship. Everyday Amos McGee spends time with his friends at the zoo. He keeps the shy penguin company, runs races with the tortoise, and reads bedtime stories with the owl. However, one day Amos McGee could not make it to the zoo because he was sick, so all of his zoo friends came to see him and returned the favor. Evaluation: This is a really great book and the pictures are great. It tells a great story about friendship. Has hidden messages throughout the pictures for higher thinking skills. It also has a variety of animals if you wanted to do a science lesson. This would be a great read aloud book or for independent reading. I really enjoyed this book as well as the illustrations.Teaching Idea: This book could be used for so many different teaching ideas. One teaching idea I had was to talk about the animals. I would have cut outs of the different animals and a sheet that says animals sort. They would have to sort the animals based on legs, size, color, and shape. I think this would be a fun and engaging lesson for younger students."}, {"userName": "Ubah Khasimuddin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18500983-ubah-khasimuddin", "userReview": "Love this classic book - it is so sweet, you Amos McGee is like Mr. Rodgers, just so sweet and takes care of all the animals at the zoo, with their quirks, just adorable.
