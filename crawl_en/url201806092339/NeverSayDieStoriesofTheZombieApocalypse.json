Much has happened in that time. He's managed to make a new life for himself as part of the New Alliance, a zombie-free zone. He's even gotten married. So when Jack finally finds his sister, Maya, you might think that would be the end of the story, but you'd be wrong. Oh, so wrong. A dark tale well-told.Gordon & Elena - All children, under the age of twelve, have fallen into some kind of inexplicable coma. What happens net has the 24 hour news outlets speculating. \"Terrorism. The Rapture. Aliens. Gamma Ray Burst. Zombies.\" Through it all, Gordon & Elena are trying to get on with their divorce. A wonderfully inventive twist on the zombie scenario.Patient 63 - Finally a cure for a disease which has left half the world dead, or worse, infected. Well, maybe not. Proof again that author, Stevie Kopas, really understands the zombie sub-genre. This was my personal favorite in a diverse collection of zombie lit.Rosie - The zombie apocalypse from a child's point of view with a great opening paragraph. \"I'm always really scared when there's a thunderstorm. Usually Mommy or Daddy will sing to me until I fall asleep or until the rain stops, but Daddy tried to hurt me, so Mommy killed him.\"Trevor - Trevor works in customer service, a thankless job where customers dish out verbal abuse like it's their God-given right. When things fall apart as a result of the zombie apocalypse, Trevor sees it as an opportunity to exact revenge on some of the worst offenders. Working in the same field, I can't say as I blame him.If you're looking for a quick zombie fix this Summer, Stevie Kopas has just what you're looking for.Never Say Die: Stories of The Zombie Apocalypse is currently a Kindle exclusive.

I remembered thinking that her entries in each of the AT HELL'S GATES anthologies were by far the standout of the anthology. One of those stories, \"Patient 63\" (*****) is reprinted here, and it scintillates as ever. The other four are unavailable anywhere else, so let's take a brief look at each in turn:\"Jack\" - ****Jack is a denizen of a postapocalyptic New Orleans who becomes bound up in a desperate crusade to save his sister. A few of the twists in this story are a bit telegraphed and the setting is oddly underutilized, but aside from that this is a dark, disturbing, and dare I say unique tale of obsession and horror.\"Gordon and Elena\" - ****On the day of their divorce two estranged lovers find a new chance at love when the zombie apocalypse strikes. The weakest story of the collection, but nothing terrible - we're just spoiled with riches.\"Rosie\" - *****If it wasn't for \"Trevor\" (which we'll get to in a second) I'd say this is the standout of the collection. As it is, this is one of the best zombie stories I've ever read and again, perhaps astonishingly, it's unique. A pitch-perfect tale narrated by a six-year-old girl trying to understand the zombie apocalypse, there are so many ways this story could have gone wrong and yet Kopas never makes a single misstep. There isn't a word out of place.\"Trevor\" - *****The magnum opus of the collection, Kopas truly saves the best for last. So dark it needs a disclaimer and so outrageously hilarious you'll squirt milk out of your nose reading it. This is a story that truly must be read to be believed. Bonus points if you've ever worked in any kind of customer service job.For the collection as a whole, a well deserved *****. Buy it now for yourself and all your friends."}, {"userName": "Mehsi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6720768-mehsi", "userReview": "So I found out about this book through my new friend on Goodreads: Ash \u2020Reviews of a FearStreetZombie\u2020! I just had to read it when I found out. Zombies are one of my favourite horror creatures. So what follows here is first the status update, and then in bold some added comments to that. Jack: 2 stars. Sorry, but this was just sick. Especially the last part was just too disturbing. She had nothing to do with it, why did she have to, urgh, never mind. :| I could understand why Jack did what he did, but really? He knew what would happen. :( I am not sure what I would have done if I was in his shoes, it is a difficult decision, but I am sure his sister wouldn't have wanted this either.Still definitely agreeing with myself. Yes, I am not sure what I would have done, but to endanger not only yourself but also your wife? No. If I didn't have any connections to anyone I would have done what our MC did, but I wouldn't have done it if I had a life. If I knew the consequences to those around me. On another note, I did like how this one took place a few years after the zombie apocalypse. There were still zombies, there was still fear, but it seemed to go a little bit better with the world. Often books just pick the outbreak, so I am delighted with any changes to that. Lastly, who the hell would do that to a human? That is just sick and disturbing.Gordon & Elena: 5 stars. *cries*That was just, sorry, that was just a emotional story. So so sad. :( The author does something that I haven't seen happening a lot. I won't spoil the ending, just will say that it was heartbreaking, and I didn't expect it. I loved how the story unfolded as well. Starting with an average day, though deaths are happening, to children coming back to life, and eating everything. o.0I was worried about this one at first. I thought these 2 would either continue fighting all the time, or that one of them would die and the other would *insert any kind of emotion*. Luckily, it turned into something totally different, something really different. I was delighted with how they could set aside their differences. Patient 63: 5 stars. Oh my goodness this one was terrific! I loved it through and through, though I definitely didn't see that ending coming, but I have to say it was quite a wonderful ending (though OK, maybe not so wonderful for everyone).This was definitely a heartbreaking story, with a twist ending that I didn't see coming. I felt oh so sorry for Patient 63 (I will call her that as what happens later is a bit of a spoiler). Sorry that she was revived, and then used for experiments. Having no life of her own, no hope that she might get out.I was a bit worried about the romance, but in the end I was definitely delighted with it. She deserves happiness.Rosie: 4 stars. It did get a bit annoying. It was an interesting thing to have a six year old tell the story of the outbreak, and see how it was from her POV, but she was so frustratingly annoying at times. The ending was also a bit confusing.Yep, I still think it was pretty great that they had the POV be from a child. It was quite interesting to see what she thought and how she acted and reacted. Though I did wish Rosie had gotten a bit smarter. She must have noticed that it wasn't normal for her not to get x and y by zombies. She must have seen it was dangerous to just go outside.The ending to this story was weird and confusing. I am not entirely sure what was going on with that Doctor.Trevor: I am in conflict between a 1 and a 2 star. It was quite fun that our MC was that, but what he did in this one and how suicide and all that was handled? Nah. :|Yep, still my least favourite story, and I have decided on a 1.5 stars in the end. Yes, I did like what the MC was, not really a spoiler as you know it from the start, I mean, duh, of course it should be that. I was quite disgusted with what he did though. :| I know they did you wrong, but to do this? No. Just no. That is never a good thing. All in all though, I really liked this book, and I hope that the author will write more books like this. I could use some more of these short stories taking place from various times in a zombie apocalypse. I would recommend this one to everyone!Review first posted at https://twirlingbookprincess.com"}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16996638-renee", "userReview": "A collection of five zombie themed short stories, each with a distinctly different voice. Stevie explores the horror sub genre with a different zombie origin in each story. These stories are not all blood and gore (though there is plenty of that too), they focus on the relationships between characters and how they cope in the zombie apocalypse. My favourite was Rosie - a story told from the perspective of a six year old girl. It reminded me of Room by Emma Donoghue, the horror described by an innocent, naive first person narrator. With two children of my own a similar age, this story really touched me.I received this book free in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Verna Loves Books", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14118587-verna-loves-books", "userReview": "Never Say Die: Stories of The Zombie Apocalypse by Stevie Kopas is a collection of zombie stories thrown into one book. I found each story had it's own unique story line that would captivate you and leave you wishing that each one was longer or had it's own book.Some of my favorite's in this book were Jack and Rosie. Jack was an unbelievably trusting and loving man who didn't want to leave his sister to the fate the horrible men in the story had given her. So when the end of it came, I was shocked and broken for Jack. I so hope that Stevie will write more of Jack's story. Rosie is a loving child who is dealt a cruddy hand in the zombie apocalypse, but it was so touching that her mom still protected her no matter what had happened to her. Such wonderful stories, especially to those who love Zombies as much as I do.I give Never Say Die: Stories of The Zombie Apocalypse by Stevie Kopas 4 out of 5 APOCALYPTIC STARS."}, {"userName": "Ash \u2020Reviews of a FearStreetZombie\u2020", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28576491-ash-reviews-of-a-fearstreetzombie", "userReview": "Yasssss!!! More zombies from Stevie!!!THIS IS A ZOMBIE LOVER MUST HAVE!!!!We have a winner, folks! She has done it again! Stevie Kopas has done it again!Another kill of be killed, heart stopping, mind numbing, bomb diggity, monster read!!!You know, I often wonder how. or even if authors can top their previous work and it honestly always amazes me when they do. You think, there is no way they can top what they did, they pulled out all the stops, how can there possibly be more?..... only for you to find out there are about a million more stops that can possibly be pulled.... and that is exactly what Stevie did. Lol.This book was bloody freaking brilliant and showed a whole NEW side to zombies!Moooooove over Warm Bodies, Never Say Die is stealing the spot light.Oh! Oh! Oh! Before you think \"Ew, if it's like Warm Bodies, noooo thanks.\" .....Rethink that thought. Warm Bodies cowers to Never Say Die, Warm Bodies is Never Say Die's bitch!.... and Never Say Die *breathy-in-awe-voice* is the freaking shiznit!I loved all of these short stories, they really leave you mind boggled. I can't tell you how many times, all around the house, I had this book in front of my face randomly screaming \"No freaking way!\" \"Oh you gotta be kidding me!\" \"Oh snap!\" \"Seriously?!\" .... the list goes on and on, so I recommend not reading this in a public library.... You WILL be told to \"shhh!\"....and possibly asked to leave when you can't possibly keep the outbursts to yourself. LolI thought this book was very well written. Like this is the master of all writing, it was that good to me. I loved each and every story because they ALL offered such new, raw stuff! Even when SOME had the same kind of zombie, it was still new! How that was managed, I have no idea, because that is just plain awesome-sauce right there. The story lines were new and mind blowing.... It always kept you on your toes wondering what would happen and when you guessed what could happen, it turned out wrong. This book can make you so freaking grossed out to the point of your stomach turning, but wanting more and no possible way for you to put it down! Oh why did they have to end so short though!?

The difference in each plot and setting makes each one refreshing. There are a few errors as mentioned by others in spelling etcetera but they did not bother me as the bulk of the stories were fine.There are five stories in this collection and I had to stay up into the wee hours to finish them all in one go. Some made me sad, some made me smile and some I just laughed aloud at, there is indeed something for everyone that likes Zombies. This is a must have collection for Zombie book lovers and paranormal fans. I will most definitely be looking for more titles Stevie Kopas.Jack A man trying to rebuild a life after the dark years while still looking for a sister he\u2019s lost. Will he find her and fulfil his vow to her?Gordon and ElenaA couple that\u2019s drifted apart until chaos and fear shows them who they want to be with at the end.Patient 63 Can one woman hold the key to a cure that will save the world? Can love emerge in even the darkest moments? Or will lies end everything? (available outside of the collection)Rosie How does a six-year-old girl understand a Zombie apocalypse? This is beautifully written and allows you to enjoy the story even though a child is the main character. This is also one of my favourites in the book.Trevor A man ready to give up on life finds that maybe a Zombie apocalypse is just what he needs to find his place in society. Full of humour and amusing situations if a little dark. This was my favourite out of the whole collection.Independent Reviewer for Romance Authors that Rock On"}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17797305-brittany", "userReview": "All of these stories together is one big roller coaster of emotions. One story your laughing the next story you crying like a baby. I loved this collection and can't wait to continue reading more from this great author!Jack- Jacks story was more than a little disturbing.... and I loved it... (the bad- the author mixed up the names of the sister and the wife... this through me off for a minute. it really needa to be fixed) .This one left me in the fetal position rocking back and forth like a crazy person..... Utter Despair! ....but I kept reading.... Gordon and Elena- this is almost a zombie apocalypse love story.... almost....Patient 63- I thought this was a unique spin on things. I throughly enjoyed this short story.... there were 2 stories that I really thought could go on to have a full novel as a standalone.... this is one of them... I want more! Lol Rosie- i don't know if I was just emotional or if it was the bond between a mother and her child.... I pretty much cried while I read this whole story. it was sad and yet amazingly beautiful as it shows you the love between a mother and her child. zombie virus be damned!Trevor Fink- I love his name! now this story had me laughing.... not exactly at the beginning but more towards the middle.... you'll see why. this story compared to the movie Shaun of the Dead. ridiculous and hilarious at times! I found Trevor and Tim like two peas in a pod and just meant to be best friends... this is the second story that I feel could go on and be a full novel. Each one of these stories were as unique as their zombies. The world building of each short story was completely genius.

I found the stories to have a nice variety to them, skipping back and forth in time from years after society has fallen to just before and during. The clever thing Kopas does with her take on zombies is use them to tell surprisingly human stories. It's not just about the apocalypse, it's about exploring relationships during the apocalypse. A man looking for his lost sister. A couple in the middle of a nasty divorce. A lowly man hiding a forbidden love. These are things people can relate to and empathize with in any setting, but they're given a new spin by setting them in a world of horror. At the same time, if you're a fan of the genre and enjoy seeing chaos and bloodshed, there's still plenty to be found."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7314984-karen", "userReview": "I especially enjoyed the Story Jack,however the author needs an editor for this book.The abundance of misplaced words and incorrect words in a sentence was jarring.The worst part was the few paragraphs in the Jack story where the author switches the names of his sister and wife.This definitely decreased my enjoyment of this short story collection."}], "description": "Family, friends, lovers\u2026 Those are just a few examples of the strong bonds that hold humanity together.
