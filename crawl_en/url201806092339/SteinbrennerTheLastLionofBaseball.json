I prefer not to read what Lester Bangs classified as \u201cpuff pieces\u201d, instead, opting for an author that owed no allegiance to the subject. Bill Madden covered the Yankees as beat writer for New York\u2019s Daily News, spanning thirty years. Given the controversial nature of Steinbrenner, the only realistic way Madden could write this book was to do so, head-on. In my view, he succeeded, as not to take a direct approach, would have set himself up for criticism from both his peers, and baseball fans at large.George Steinbrenner was an adult version of the very annoying kid many of us met in our adolescence - born on third base because of the happenstance of his birthright, he nevertheless reminded you frequently and unconvincingly, that it was rather his athletic prowess in hitting a triple into the gap, that initially placed him on third. Steinbrenner\u2019s watershed moment was not his birthright, but instead, his purchase of the Yankees in 1973 from CBS for a mere $10 Million. In spite of his constant intermeddling, the Yankees won, and often. Today in 2013, the Yankees franchise was valued by Forbes at $2.3 Billion, in no small measure the result of Steinbrenner\u2019s alacrity and shrewd, innovative business practices. Arguably, \u201cThe Boss\u201d was one of the most successful sports business executives and owners, not just among his peers, but perhaps of all-time.Madden provides a balanced view of Steinbrenner\u2019s life, among which are the private details of his personal and family life which for me, was a mystery until I read this book. Additionally, I was unaware of his very caring, charitable nature to virtual strangers, much of which was done anonymously. Beneath the coarse, rude exterior of an aggressive, provocative, bombastic man, are glimpses of a decent human being.Some of the funniest parts of this book pertain to Steinbrenner\u2019s interaction with his staff, his general and field managers, and most amusing of all, his always awkward interaction with his players. Graig Nettles, a very clutch hitter with a Hall of Fame glove, routinely laughed at Steinbrenner. Lou Piniella, as both a player and manager, openly argued with George. Three time American League MVP, Yankee manager, and Hall of Famer, Yogi Berra, literally boycotted Yankee Stadium for fourteen years, given his disdain for both The Boss\u2019 intermeddling and the manner in which he was dismissed as field manager. Perhaps the funniest anecdote is that of Rick Cerone, the journeyman catcher, who had the unenviable position of replacing the late-Thurman Munson. Following a playoff loss to Milwaukee, George was \u201cblistering his players\u201d to which Cerone interrupted the tirade with \u201cFeck you George! You don\u2019t know what you are talking about. You don\u2019t know a fecking thing about baseball.\u201dThe most memorable player is Hall of Fame Pitcher, Rich \u201cGoose\u201d Gossage, hands-down, the best multiple innings closer in the history of the game. His dominating figure invoked the same fear that Hall of Fame Pitchers, Bob Gibson and Don Drysdale did when a batter stepped in to face them. He affectionately referred to Steinbrenner as \u201cthe fat man\u201d, responding to Steinbrenner\u2019s continuous, public criticism of his players. After his six-year contract was up, Gossage unceremoniously stated: \u201cI\u2019ve just had enough of the bullshitte that goes on there.\u201dIf you are a Yankees fan, a New York baseball fan like me, or just a baseball fan that lived through Steinbrenner\u2019s more than thirty years of active ownership of the Yankees, this is a historical, sometimes sad, and oftentimes funny book about a very polarizing, yet memorable man."}, {"userName": "Lisa K", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60846541-lisa-k", "userReview": "I liked it at first but I think I picked the wrong time to read a book that is mostly a lunatic billionaire yelling a lot."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8013496-elizabeth", "userReview": "Detailed account of Steinbrenner and his relationships with managers, players, former players, fellow owners."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2099338-jonathan", "userReview": "This is a good portrait of George Steinbrenner written by someone who was there. Madden has put together a fascinating portrait which should be of interest to Yankee fans and anyone interested in the modern business of sports. Steinbrenner was clearly a smart, talented businessman whose passion for winning helped revitalize a franchise that had become moribund. His insistence that the franchise operate in a \"first class\" manner -- from upgrading training facilities to making sure the luxury boxes were properly swept -- helped restore badly needed luster to the most famous name in American professional sports. As Madden shows, for better or worse (and there is plenty of both), Steinbrenner also helped to usher in a new era in American professional sports. There are doubtless men and women who have achieved great success in business while retaining, at the very least, a basic integrity in their dealings with others. George Steinbrenner, sadly, was not one of those people. As Madden's book reminds us, even as Steinbrenner is being lionized and mythologized in death, he was a bully, a blowhard, and a consistent liar. Steinbrenner's felony convictions are the tip of the iceberg. Indeed, from the outset of his time with the Yankees, he seems to have regarded deceving his business associates, his partners, his employees and his players as just good, tough business practice. Steinbrenner was a complicated figure and Madden amply documents his capacity for warmth, generosity, and even genuine remorse for at least some misdeeds. The reader also gets a sense of Steinbrenner's unyielding, perpetually disapproving father -- and it is not hard to figure out from whence at least some of Steinbrenner's demons sprang. Madden is at his best during the early years of Steinbrenner's tenure, helped, no doubt, by his access to the taped diary entries made by Yankee President Gabe Paul. His coverage of Steinbrenner's later years (and the Yankee dynasty of the late 90's/2000's), by comparison, is quite thin and unsatisfying. Another complaint is that Madden's book could have used one more good round of editing. There are too many instances of needless repetition of facts from one chapter to the next. But these are minor flaws. Madden had made a nice contribution here to baseball and business lore."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2797718-kevin", "userReview": "This is a fairly detailed book about George Steinbrenner that draws heavily on anecdotes from his business associates, family, former employees, and others that were within his sphere of influence. Quite a bit of the material was just condensing and rehashing of news stories from Steinbrenner's four decades of owning the Yankees, but there were some great behind the scenes stories too.Madden does a good job showing the irrationality of Steinbrenner and leaves us with the impression that it all stemmed from Steinbrenner's inability to ever live up to his father's expectations. That might be the heart of the explanation, but I kind of doubt that it fully explains why Steinbrenner constantly hired and fired Billy Martin, Lou Piniella, and Gene Michael.All in all, I was left with the impression that Steinbrenner could be a great guy to deal with if you were running a charity, but that working directly under the man would lead to an absolutely miserable existence. It was interesting to read this book and compare it to Joe Torre's Yankee Years regarding the end of Torre's tenure as skipper of the Yanks. From the Steinbrenner perspective, Torre had forgotten that Steinbrenner was singly responsible for Torre's celebrity, wealth, and status as one of the most successful managers in the game. Torre's book suggested that Steinbrenner had been unduly influenced by others in the organization who wanted him out and that the new deal was an insult. I think Torre's version gets more play because he got his book out there first, but this certainly provides an interesting counterpoint.Steinbrenner revolutionized baseball in awarding some of the largest free agent contracts and his very hands-on approach to owning a team, but he also burned a lot of bridges along the way. If you're interested in learning about the last of the brash, outspoken baseball team owners, I'd recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1301028-michael", "userReview": "It's funny: I'm 28 and started following the Yankees seriously around 1994, the strike year, so all I've known is unthinkable success and stability. Certainly that's how the Yankee brass wants you to remember the Steinbrenner era -- just look at the YES Network's love-fest for the man on their Yankeeography show; all the guests tripped over themselves to out-praise Steinbrenner.Sometimes you have to be reminded that immediately preceding the 15+ years of winning since the strike ended was a period of mediocrity that lasted almost as long -- and could be sourced back to the same man. No club that goes through 17 managers in 17 years and fields players at the whim of a man with the impulses of a 7-year-old (and the management technique of your average schoolyard bully) could have won the way the Yankees of yesteryear did. Is it purely coincidence that the two greatest periods of success since Steinbrenner took over the team, the late 1970s and the 1996-2001 run (the vestiges of which remain still), are due in large part to personnel decisions made because Steinbrenner was banned from the everyday baseball operations of the team?Bill Madden's book is a nice run-through for relatively young fans like me about the Steinbrenner era as seen by someone who was in the trenches every day, a wake-up call that the same man we can credit for turning the Yankees into a global empire is also responsible for some truly grievous decisions as well. George Steinbrenner is the definition of a complex character, a benevolent dictator, a petulant crank whose teams have won (way) more World Series than any other team since 1974, a ruthless entrepreneur who saw the potential in free agency and changed the game forever. A novelist couldn't make him up, but Madden does a good job at trying to portray him, warts and all."}, {"userName": "P.J.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4300835-p-j", "userReview": "Allow me to preface this by saying I am not a fan of George Steinbrenner or the New York Yankees. But to deny what the man did for baseball would be outrageous. When this book first came out, I knew it was something I wanted to read. I head off, however, and when I recently invested in a Kindle, this was the first book I got.I'm glad I did.I like the way Bill Madden wrote this book -- from the eyes of everyone else, but at the same time with glimpses from Steinbrenner as well. This might be the best book ever written on this man. It shows areas where many may have have already hears -- the way he treated employees, opponents and others -- to the softer side of the Boss. Such as how he always seemed to show regrets on firing somebody or how he always seemed to take care of people who had been Yankees.There are times I laughed, felt disbelief and was saddened. To see anyone -- especially somebody such as Steinbrenner -- grow old and sick is tough. This book shows you truly what the Yankees went through during these times.It's a true, in-depth look at Steinbrenner, his life and his team. The relationships he had with Billy Martin, Gene Michael and many other Yankee names. How the Yogi saga was finally put to rest. When I ended this book, I didn't have any questions.I would call this a must-read for Yankee fans and true baseball fans. Even borderline fans could probably enjoy and take away from it a bit more about the Boss. I wouldn't have read many books on baseball owners, but for a man such as Steinbrenner, I did and it was well worth it. I easily give this book 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5720388-steve", "userReview": "I guess I am in agreement with a majority of the ones who have read and critiqued Bill Maddon's depiction of Steinbrenner. I am also a lifelong Yankee fan who cringed everytime Steinbrenner opened his mouth to the press on a Yankee disappointment because it usually led to the firing of one manager after another. One would have thought he would have mellowed after the second banishment, but he kept on going. There were some wonderful moments in the book that Maddon wrote to show Steinbrenner in a better light...his concern for Thurman Munson's family and strides he took to see that the Munsons were taken care of and that the Yankees were able to pay their respects to their fallen captain. His charity to causes and to employees in need were also noted. However, Madden's book focused more on Steinbrenner, the unforgiving owner who expected perfection every season, expected loyalty from every person and demanded attention from the players, the owners, MLB and the press that covered the circus known as the \"Bronx Zoo.\" We Yankee fans salute his memory, his seven World Series titles, 11 American League pennants and the stars he brought to New York. Who knows what could have happenned if he'd let the baseball people lead the effort."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6246626-kristen", "userReview": "This is a well-done biography of Steinbrenner, and I walk away thinking we have perhaps recently been engaged in bit of revisionist history about him. Without hammering the reader, the parade of GM after GM, manager after manager, and insane rant after insane rant reminds us that Steinbrenner really was a bully. Most baseball followers know the higher visibility dealings with Billy Martin and the string of managers, but some of the details of other staff are amazing. He made an employee carry a bag of garbage around with him all day after he saw it not picked up from the suites. He threatened to fire people because it was raining and a game was postponed. Also, after he fired managers, he often then made overtures to get them back. Anyone ever work for a boss who was unpredictable, micromanaged, acted impulsively, and kept had a hair-trigger on the button to fire people? Ugh! Recent defenses that \"he was a winner\" don't make this right. These views of Steinbrenner's character, however, are part of what makes this an interesting read (and it isn't a hatchet job). The book contains a lot of details and behind-the-scenes looks that I wasn't aware of (or was too young to appreciate). I think both Yankee lovers and haters will enjoy this book (although I find it hard to speak for the latter category, as a member of the former)."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310604-nick", "userReview": "This was a very readable and informative, yet uneven, portrait of George Steinbrenner. It excels at sketching out specifics of Yankees history from the early 70's up until the 2000's, but largely leaves the rest of Steinbrenner's life untouched. You will get incredibly detailed reporting of his 9 to 5 life, but little else that might explain what really made him tick.I came into this book already essentially detesting him, thinking of him as the person who turned the Yankees into the most hated team in baseball, the person who made Yankees tickets all but unaffordable and the one who tore down a landmark of a stadium for a crappy cookie cutter replica.That is largely unchanged now.If anything, I now have even less respect for him given how amateurishly he dealt with nearly all of his subordinates. His temper tantrums were hilariously covered, and by the end of the book you wonder why anyone would ever work (much less play) for him.But, after all his said and done, he has success on his side. No owner in recent history has been nearly as successful as him, so I guess you have to give him credit there.If nothing else, it is a great trip through memory lane for Yankees fans."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6207179-justin", "userReview": "Having started watching the Yankees during the strike-shortened season of 1994 I have really lived a charmed life watching the Yankees. No losing seasons and multiple championships. Bill Madden's book about Steinbrenner does a great job telling the story of the man who created the Yankees I know.Since his death, I have been hoping that George Steinbrenner would get nominated to the Baseball Hall of Fame and would be a lock to get in. But after reading this book I am not sure he is deserving of that honor. Did \"The Boss\" change the business of baseball as we know it, absolutely! But this man was also the biggest bully of them all and his actions make it hard for me to say he is deserving of that honor.He made countless numbers of his employees lives miserable. He hurt people's feelings, ruined friendships and engaged in criminal acts. After reading this book I know I could never work for The Boss.Other than the man himself, the book is a wonderful read where you can learn about the Yankees, the trades, the signings, and the business of baseball.

It is a well-researched and balanced book that paints a full portrait of the former Yankees owner from the questionable business practices he employed to the abusive personality he unleashed on many a manager, player, and front office employee. Later in life, Steinbrenner would seem to mellow and attempt to make amends for his past grievous sins, but he would have much to atone for.The book alternates from painting broad brushstrokes of situations that arose during the owner's tenure with revealing finer details about what went on behind the scenes often exacerbating this original situation.For all the wealth of information on the era, one shortcoming is that the book is not very organized.

Madden did not hold back and did not sugar coat in his book. As a life long Yankee fan born in the late 70's, I really enjoyed the behind the scenes stories that Madden wrote about. Steinbrenner certainly was an interesting man, he was definitely a bully, definitely passionate about winning, and definitely made many a mistakes while running this organization, but he also was the main reason, be it directly or indirectly that the Yankees are the dominant, successful franchise and business that they are today. This is a great biography. It will at times make you hate Steinbrenner for his meddling, appreciate him for his passion, and feel bad for him in his later years.

There were some parts that seemed to skip around, or jump ahead in time without explaining how someone arrived at the Yankees, and some parts were a bit repetitive.

It doesn't seem to have happened here. That left the end a bit unsatisfying, no send off, just a fading away to an abrupt ending.

It's interesting that so many people who he fired - not just managers, at all - continued to work within his organization and/or continued to be the man's friend.
