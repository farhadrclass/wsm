This is nothing like I have ever read before. I have never read a book about Nigerian mythology and probably can count on one hand the number of books I've read that actually take place in Africa. With that being said, Abiku got a lot of points for just being something different. I loved seeing the local mythology and culture. So many books set in the West and getting to see into the lives of normal Africans was just so different and so unique. Now, there were some confusing parts, but I think it was more of a cultural difference than anything. Dayo is our lead character. She finds herself torn between two romances in two different worlds. She has little to no more code when it comes to love. It seemed like she would sleep with anyone under the sun, which just is not right. She has no feeling, no remorse, no nothing. I get that she is supposed to be a goddess, but still...Can't she feel just a little bit? While I did enjoy the mythology aspect of her character, there wasn't much else to her. She wasn't developed and it made it really difficult to get to know her. With such a short book, it really is hard to develop characters. However, I really do feel like had the sex scenes been trimmed down a bit, we would have gotten to know Dayo just a little bit better. Now, the writing was just okay. Some of the paragraphs just didn't flow right, which resulted in a childlike writing. The ideas and events are captured, but not in a way that is fully satisfying. The sex scenes seemed to be the only thing that was done to their full capability, while other fully necessary parts were kind of jumped over. It is just very clear that Elizabeth has a background in children's fiction, not adult. Maybe she should have tried her hand at young adult first. Another thing is that the title is misleading. I was expecting a full out battle between the gods, not a fight over Deyo. There is no major showdown. The little bit of battle we get in the last five pages is just not enough. I was just expecting the gods to be in full out war, I guess. Again, not a terrible read. I am not upset that I read this book. It is short and I do think people who love short books will enjoy it. I believe there is a few more weeks until the book comes out, so my review may not match the final product as I am reading an ARC."}, {"userName": "Anusha Narasimhan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16375752-anusha-narasimhan", "userReview": "[The slightly childish writing with many digressions showed me that Dayo is someone who cannot make up her mind easily and is a bit immature.

Although I know little about bourgeois Nigerian culture, I read this quickly and willingly, due to its conversational tone and fascinating insight into coming of age in Nigeria.Abiku: A Battle of the Gods starts out traditionally enough. Dayo is young and innocent, but, as many young people are wont to do, she succumbs to the illicit delights of adulthood: sex, drugs, and falling in love. She seduces Henry, her family\u2019s chauffeur, and tries crack for the first time, which results in her hallucinating a god named Akin, who wants to claim her for his own. Or is that hallucination, in fact, real? Dayo and, by extension, the reader becomes more and more confused. Doesn\u2019t Dayo love Henry? Then why has she consented to a very public mating ceremony with Akin? The answer lies in Yoruban folklore, which adds a funky twist to the two-men-fighting-over-one-woman formula. For those who are prudish about flagrant sex and spotty punctuation, be warned that there\u2019s a lot of the former and not much of the latter."}, {"userName": "Valentina Markasovi\u0107", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22042228-valentina-markasovi", "userReview": "[goddess or not (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "T.L.

The topic of Nigerian folklore is intriguing, for a start.This book is told in the form of a very long letter from the main character. There's quite a few Nigerian words, but there's a handy glossary at the back should you require it.I got the gist without using that though. Most of the book is set in Lagos, which again is unusual, but in a good way.I could almost feel the bright sun shining down on me, even although it is not specifically described and I was sitting in cold, rainy England. I began reading, and was anxious about Dayo's emerging drug addiction.But then the book took a very unexpected turn. OK, she is a slightly annoying person. And the gods are a little odd. But they're quite fun to read. I was pulled into the story straight away, and couldn't wait to see what would happen next.Devoured in just a few days (which is quick for me!)."}, {"userName": "Patito10", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57945060-patito10", "userReview": "I was given an ARC for an honest review. ***\u00a0Two things stand out for me in this captivating book- the flowing narrative style and the interesting plot.\u00a0The plot, which weaves between this world and the 'spirit', otherworldly realm is the type which can be difficult to pull off by a less creative and experienced writer. But the Author does a beautiful job of it, giving vivid pictures of both worlds, making the main character, Dayo move between both in a seamless manner.\u00a0There's a lot of the Yoruba culture and mythology in the book which non-speaking readers might find strange and bewildering but there's thankfully a glossary to guide readers.\u00a0It's an enjoyable book with a unique story line that's captivating. There's a lot of heat, lots of erotic and graphic sex scenes which might not be to everybody's tastes- but hey, it's an erotic/romance story so that should be expected! It's a strictly 18+ book.\u00a0A few issues though- we see Dayo either having hot sex with one of the two men- mortal and god/immortal or thinking about sex. Is she a nympho or what? Doesn't she do anything else, like attending lectures, studying, going to parties, outings like normal students do? The average Nigerian campus is a very vibrant one where all kinds of stuff/activities take place. Readers would have loved to see her doing some of these, to show what an average Naija student goes through on campus.Her activities are a bit restricted maybe due to the format the story is written in which is the first person POV. This tends to limit what the writer/narrator can say in terms of descriptions, incidents or scenes outside the narrator's reach.\u00a0\u00a0I love the battle between the two men Henry and Akin for Dayo's love. I want to know who will win in the end; hopefully that will be resolved in the sequel.\u00a0Another thing is Dayo's relationship with Henry, her parents' driver. I bet you he will be one dead guy if her wealthy parents find out he's been humping their precious daughter. There might not be an 'official' caste system in Nigeria like in a country like India, for instance. But when it comes to dating/ marriage across social/economic divides, a 'caste system' definitely exists. \u00a0A lady who's a university graduate is not expected to date a cook, driver, a road sweeper, labourer etc. Doing so is 'social suicide' resulting in condemnation, ridicule and abuse.  So, it will be interesting to know how this will be resolved.\u00a0I give this book a 4 star; would have got more if the main character had been better developed and the setting expanded beyond Dayo's bedroom activities, drug taking, etc. Anyway, do we blame her with a hunk like Henry and a 'god' like Akin all drooling over her!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A wonderful work! Kudos to the writer! Will definitely read her future books!"}, {"userName": "Janeandjerry", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5686775-janeandjerry", "userReview": "This was an unedited advance review copy sent to me by the author in exchange for an honest review and so here is my review...This book was different than any other book I've read before not sure if it was the language barriers or what it was but it was very confusing for me to read but yet interesting at the same time.The characters and book all flowed together even though a name or two in my opinion could had been changed but once I got to the end I figured it out and understood why the names were like they were. but again like mentioned could had been the language barriers for me.I did not find any erotica in the book but of course again could had been me there was some passion in the book but not a much as I would had expected could had been more but again this is my own opinions.

It is the story of Dayo, a bi-racial twenty something year old, and has a conversational feel to it, so that you feel as though Dayo is speaking to you personally.Genre wise, it is a paranormal romance, with erotic scenes and some interesting Nigerian folklore and customs, something I am unfamiliar with.For example, Dayo stressed about the size of her bum, not because it was too big, but because it wasn't big enough!! Bums that 'jiggle' are desired, and there is a lot of emphasis on bums in relation to beauty in her culture. Feeling insecure about her lack of a bum, Dayo wore three to five pairs of granny pants and cycling shorts so it didn't look so flat which made me laugh because I remember my cousin doing that with training bras so she didn't look flat.After an incident at school, Daya said, \"I told mom about it and she laughed saying everything in life is an illusion. People who do not have long hair wear wigs. People who are short wear high heeled shoes.\"So true.When Dayo finds herself involved in two romances, one in an alternate realm that she may or may not be hallucinating, (I don't want to give away spoilers here) it is not until she finds herself married to one of them that she fully realizes the situation she has found herself in.\"Abiki: A Battle of Gods\" is a short read that would be good for people looking for something a little different."}, {"userName": "Alan Wright", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52901355-alan-wright", "userReview": "This book can be read in a day.

Soon she is caught up in relationship with a god, and discovers that she is more than who she thought she was...This story deserves major props for its concept, which takes the genre of paranormal romance and transplants it from North America and Western Europe to Nigeria, where most of the action takes place. Nigerian culture is presented naturally, through Dayo's eyes, so that we see it from the point of view of a member of the culture rather than as something that has been exoticized and distorted for foreign consumption. The use of Pidgin English in certain passages, where it is presented as a normal and natural way to speak, is particularly refreshing.I also liked the idea of presenting the narrative as a letter from Dayo to the reader, which allows her to speak in a breezy, conversational style that flows like an oral narrative. The trade-off is a lack of the description and development that the reader might expect to find in a written work: the plot and characters are for the most part sketched rather than depicted in full (although FYI: the sex scenes are quite explicit). This does not read like a typical paranormal romance, and at times I found myself wanting more, as it felt like there was enough plot for twice as much book at least. However, readers looking for a quick (I finished it in about an hour) read with a refreshingly different heroine and setting may well want to check \"Abiku\" out.I received a free review copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Maggie Hasbrouck", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5860499-maggie-hasbrouck", "userReview": "Abiku: A Battle Of GodsOverall: This book is a fast and easy read. I loved the concept, a young girl who can travel between worlds and has a lover in each. Written in a very bare-bones style, the execution of the story was just ok. Writing: A mixed bag for me. Couched as a letter, the writing was a cross between stream of consciousness and conversation to the reader. The author jumped between past and present tense, which I found jarring. The writing, or perhaps the storytelling, did pull me through the story, which was a plus. But it lacked depth and nuance, which left me not really caring about the protagonist. The writing was a little choppy; the sex scenes were just ok. Plot: We jump right into the story, and it never lags. Not everything adds up, and I had to suspend belief at time\u2014her instant marriage to Henry, for example. Despite its shortcomings, it was the plot that carried the book for me.Characters: The characters were likable enough but very undeveloped. I neither liked or disliked them. I cared just enough about them to finish the book. Recommendation: If you are looking for a different kind of erotic story, this is a quick and fairly enjoyable read.

Dayo finds herself moving back and forth between earthly and godly realms, discovering her own true identity and power from past lives and times long ago, all while navigating her two loves (one mortal, one god). The Nigerian lore and culture were very interesting, and made reading Dayo's dialect and narrative a refreshing change for me. Elizabeth Salawu did a fine job of weaving together the themes of love, culture, new adult experiences, mythology, and the paranormal into a novella length book. I would have liked to know more about Dayo's character early in the book - she bounces from one thing to the next (Henry, school, drugs, parties, etc.) without disclosing much of the reasoning behind her choices. Maybe that was intentional, Dayo did have many new freedoms after moving away from home. But it wasn't until the end of the book that I fully understood how much she loved both Henry and Akin, despite the chaotic way she found herself involved in two deep relationships. There are some interesting twists at the end as secrets are revealed and everything shakes out as it's meant to be, which kept me from putting this book down until I had read the last word."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21797699-jeanette", "userReview": "I received \u201cAbiku A Battle of Gods\u201d as an ARC for an honest review.

While already in a long distance relationship with a mortal she didn't think there was any harm in fooling around with a mysterious man in her dreams. Little did she know, she wasn't dreaming.In Short: This book is written in the format of Dayo writing a letter. She is a humorous and entertaining character who tells her story in a quick manor, but without leaving out any graphic details. This book will be appealing to those who like erotic novels that also have elements of myth and magic.Pros: I read a pre-edited version of this book and thought it was still pretty well written. Only a few typos that I'm sure will get taken care of before release. The way Dayo talks is very comical to me, she is incredibly animated and has funny perspectives on things. I think the humorous language of the book is one of the big perks of it. I like the way Dayo says, \"anyhoos\" after she finds herself babbling. Some of the phrasing and 'Pidgin English' was entertaining. At first I had a hard time following the dialogue but there was a very thorough glossary in the back!The plot is very fast paced and even if I didn't agree with Dayo's actions I was along for the ride. She really got herself into a pickle as a result of only thinking with her 'jajaina'. After the shit hit the fan there was the most shocking yet agreeable plot twist at the end. Dayo's fate is left untold but the possibilities are intriguing and that is where the second book will come in I imagine.The paranormal aspects and learning the meaning of \"Abiku\" was fun for me. I actually would have liked to see more of that, or have it drawn out longer. The ending was really exciting, where you get to see the powers and realm of the Gods. Now, if you like your erotica to have a lot of variety in it you won't be disappointed with this one. It certainly isn't vanilla and the scenes aren't redundant.Cons: Because of the short \"message in a bottle\" style of the book we miss out on some character development and detailed settings. I would have liked to see the setting better, because I have never been to Nigeria. I also at times had trouble understanding Dayo. She falls into bed easily and cheats on a seemingly great guy. The sex scenes were very fast paced and based completely on lust with very little emotions. Some parts I didn't understand what was going on.Parent's Guide: This is definitely an adult only book. There is graphic sex and drug use, and some violence."}, {"userName": "Ayla", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/623492-ayla", "userReview": "I received a free ARC copy of this e-book in exchange for an honest review.I had mixed feelings about this novella, I enjoyed the information about the Nigerian culture and mythology, but had problems connecting to the main character. The story didn't flow right. It seemed choppy. This was written as a letter, a very long letter. I am not an English teacher but the structure didn't feel right to me. The story was different , unique, but I think it could have been so much more with a little more polishing. I didnt like the use of a highly addictive drug such as crack as a trigger for the protogonists journey to the other realmn . Did she smoke it or inject it, and as a young adult I sure as hell would have not done either. Had she taken a tribal drug that would have been more with the story to my liking.  Dayo is considered beautiful by what others say to her. She seems to be only thinking about sex. I can relate when I was 20 it was a big thing BUT I was also interested in finding Love and was into commiting to 1 person . She flips back and forth between Akin and Henry without a thought of how it affects each of them. Then when she is told she is the daughter of the goddess of love she goes and tries to hurt a lecturer she was slighted by cooking his thing (we find out later it was in his head) just a little too weird and grotesque for me. And the punishment with the tiger shapeshifter also not in keeping with the idea of a love goddess. It was also a little odd that she gets married to Henry without her having a discussion about it. After all she was a rich daughter and he was a hired driver with no money.

First, I want to thank the author, Elizabeth Salawu, for writing this and sending me a copy.The story, written in an epistolary form, revolves around a lady's love (or sex) life with a mortal and an immortal.Well, I quite enjoyed reading it. It's a fast-paced read that contains African folklore and erotic content. The fact that the writer merges African folklore with the erotic is really captivating, and sweetens the story.Nevertheless, I think the paragraphs are too fragmentary, and the author captures ideas and events without buttressing on them, just joining them as they come.Aside that the language reads like a children fiction than an adult fiction. The only thing that makes this story an adult fiction is the erotic content. The writer, who appears to be a good children fiction writer, has not been able to adapt into the \"adult fiction writing technique\" of a more advanced storytelling.Furthermore, there is hardly any strong battle of gods in the story. I won't regard the dispute over Dayo as a battle. I feel the content of the story doesn't really capture the title.

Especially when she writes a passage, then pauses to say something like \"I have a great memory, that's why I can recount entire conversations word for word even though they took place a long time ago.\"Then there is the story itself, which is sadly lacking in description. I felt like I was reading the bare-bones outline, not the actual finished product. I never felt like I was there because I had no sense of the room Dayo was in or the person she was talking to.The description of the story--a girl who does crack and falls in love with a god--is captivating and unique, but I don't feel like that is the story I read. It was stilted, the characters were one-dimensional, and the erotic scenes were not descriptive enough to be remotely enticing.I don't like how negative this review has become so I'll finish with this: the concept gets an A+ from me.

It's well written and flows smoothly as it's easy to understand even if you're not conversent with the characters."}, {"userName": "Oreoluwa Sofola", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21370426-oreoluwa-sofola", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book for an honest review. I couldn't finish this book. Don't think I got past 10/15 pages. The writing was too juvenile for my taste. It seemed like I was reading a novel by a Wattpad author. I felt a lot of the dialogue was unrealistic. Once I saw the mention of Stefan Salvatore in The Vampire Diaries it was definitely my cue to leave."}, {"userName": "Alexa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9275237-alexa", "userReview": "This is a very unique story, laced with cultural references and imagery for the characters ancestry, but it doesn't take away from the romantic, erotic, and paranormal aspects.
