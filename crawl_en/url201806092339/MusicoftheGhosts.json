Intangible, yes, but also the building blocks of self-preservation, renewal : These are the most durable possesions I have. \nIf Vaddey Ratner's debut In the Shadow of the Banyan was an emotional and beautifully written read (if sometimes structurally weak), Ratner's follow up continues to showcase her lush and gorgeous writing while also delivering a more complicated, less autobiographical, and ultimately a stronger total package of a second novel. I'd give this a solid four stars: I really liked it, though it could be slowly paced in some parts. Music of the Ghosts still invokes the shadow and horrors of the period of war and genocide during American bombing and the Khmer Rouge regime, but it is first and foremost focused on what survival means for those who escaped but also lost everything, what it means to remember and to forget, what it means to forgive others and oneself, how the Cambodian people (and humans more broadly) can be broken apart and brutalized but can also heal hurts together and move forward, setting free the ghosts that haunt us to be peaceful spirits. \n \"We've become adept not so much as escaping punishment but at escaping reflection. We fear to plumb the dark and see ourselves in it, the role we played in its creation, because if we go to that depth again we may not be able to resurface, to return to light.\" \nThe two main characters, Teera and the Old Man (Tun) are solid but are also vessels for Ratner to ask her questions and search for answers. Teera the younger expatriate who returned to Cambodia after the death of her last surviving relative, her aunt, the only other person to escape death during the conflict. Teera's conflict is about coming to terms with her homeland and her Cambodian identity, something she's struggled with after losing nearly her entire family as a child and forging a new life abroad. Returning to Cambodia means facing her loss, grief, and anger, at herself, her family, the nation. The Old Man's story meanwhile deals with loss but also with guilt, as he has committed wrongs during the past conflict, and is ambivalent about forgiving himself, let alone allowing others to forgive him. The two come together, and Ratner weaves their pasts and presents into the narrative, and we shift through time to see how various actions and ideas have rippled into the present day. There are rich layers of historical detail, and information about the conflict I was completely unaware of, all of which is tied up in Ratner's evocative and sumptuous prose. And it's not necessarily her descriptions of places or things that are so lush, though I could fairly well picture the various locations in Cambodia past and present that the characters inhabit. Rather, it's the inner worlds and souls of these characters and the nation, in dialogue, in action and reaction, in storytelling that is so well developed and has such a sharp emotional impact. I think that's why I'd rate this four stars: I never forgot that these characters were instruments for Ratner's ideas, so they don't stand as well of their own two feet as individuals I won't forget or cared about. But I was drawn to what and how they thought and expressed themselves, and what and how those ideas and emotions meant in a larger context for the Cambodian people and humanity as a whole.\n In the absence of sight, when all is dark around you, it takes a deep-seated faith that others will answer your appeal, that their humanity will rise to meet your lifted hand, your raised hope, and in that brief moment, you cross the otherwise arbitrary divide between death and life. \nOverall, I'm very happy to have read Vaddey Ratner's follow up to In the Shadow of the Banyan. Music of the Ghosts continues to showcase her talent, and also proves that she can inhabit other characters as well as she was able to fictionalize her own history in her debut. I recommend this for literary fiction fans of a slowly paced but beautifully written read, one that asks a lot of questions and presents a number of ideas about guilt and forgiveness and life, and certainly an interest in 20th century history in Southeast Asia or Southeast Asian culture will help. And again, the characters themselves are less important or memorable as I might want them to be, but their stories, their suffering, their survival and rebirth are very emotionally impactful, and Ratner's language and ideas will stay with me for some time.-received a egalley on edelweiss thanks to Touchstone / Simon & Schuster"}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "I'm setting this aside .

Recently the Library Hotel called to say they loved the blog post I wrote detailing our stay, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, they still had a copy of that ARC I mentioned wanting to steal from the front desk, and if I\u2019d confirm my address, they\u2019d put it in the mail and send it to me with their thanks.See, kids? The lesson here is don\u2019t steal things. Write publicly about your desire to steal them, and people will give them to you for free! Anyway, I was jazzed to get my hands on this ARC, because Southeast Asian history is an area I\u2019d like to learn more about. I feel like I know so little about the culture, the struggles, and *ahem* U.S. involvement in that part of the world, even when it comes to the past fifty years or so. There\u2019s no excuse, man! Especially right now, when U.S. relations with just about every other country in the world are so fraught with tension and uncertainty. Ratner is a really lovely writer, and she tells a sometimes brutal and heartrending story with a featherlight touch. Obviously it\u2019s hard to sell people on a book by saying, \u201cHere! Read this book about a genocide!\u201d but Ratner truly does spin straw (or worse) into gold here. It\u2019s an ugly story at times, but her telling of it is consistently beautiful.I also found main character Teera\u2019s reflections on feeling Cambodian in America and American in Cambodia to be incredibly timely and honest, again particularly in light of the current hostility towards immigrants. I imagine it would be very difficult to feel welcome here with the vitriol that has been spewing from so many mouths.With warmest regards to the Library Hotel for the advance copy.

In many respects, Music of the Ghosts is a spiritual sequel to that debut. In Ratner\u2019s own words, \u201cIf my first novel\u2026is a story of survival, Music of the Ghosts is a story of survivors.\u201d This second novel is about a woman named Suteera who survived the Khmer Rouge genocide as a child before moving to the United States, and about an old Cambodian musician who contacts her saying he knew her father before he died. Suteera and the Old Musician reflect on the echoes of their trauma and loss, on the way the dead and the living coexist through music and memory, and on the surprising renewal of joy in their lives.First off, if you\u2019re interested in Cambodian history, the Khmer Rouge regime, or studies of genocide, you should read this book. If you\u2019re just looking for some good literary fiction, this book has beautiful qualities, but a fair number of distracting flaws.Its main strength is the grace and poetry of Ratner\u2019s prose. Her writing is breathtaking at times:\u201cTendrils of smoke coil upward and vanish with the cool breeze. The air is redolent of charcoal and firewood, the warmth of waking.\u201d\u201cHe often feels she is the current, that inaudible music just beyond hearing, slipping through this world, and he\u2019s merely one of those things, like a leaf or a laundered sheet, that take on movement, flutter to life, when she brushes past.\u201d\u201cA dream, he told himself. He\u2019d journeyed into a landscape that harbored not one moon but two, where a self could exist both as a fragmented sliver and as a complete whole, not contradictions but inverted reflections of the same truth.\u201dRatner\u2019s grappling with big, big themes here, and there are plenty of insightful reflections on things like grief, justice, and forgiveness (both on the individual level and the national level). But this book\u2019s weaknesses undercut its ability for those reflections to land. First of all, these characters are wooden shells. Ratner gives them some touches of individual identity, but for the most part, they\u2019re very obvious vessels for her ideas. I know about the histories and life philosophies of the two main characters, but I couldn\u2019t tell you one meaningful thing about either of their personalities. Paradoxically, they embody the essence of emotions but lack humanity. Consequently, I had little interest in either of them, even though their journeys were theoretically engaging. Secondly, the novel has very little plot beyond the basic premise, which isn\u2019t necessarily a problem. But this absence of plot is continuously highlighted by the book\u2019s structure and writing style. Suteera and the Old Musician\u2019s chapters constantly alternate, but I think it would\u2019ve been a much more gripping reading experience if there had been two chapters from one character before moving to the other, or if the chapters themselves had just been twice as long. As it was, this was what the structure felt like:-Chapter: The Old Musician makes tea and thinks about life.-Chapter: Suteera enters a courtyard and thinks about life.-Chapter: The Old Musician drinks his tea. Life thoughts.-Chapter: Suteera walks across the courtyard, accompanied by thoughts about life.It got to the point where things were painfully slow (and I\u2019m speaking as a reader who enjoys slow books), and everything was murderously introspective. It was merciless. I felt like screaming for ANYTHING to happen, just to give me a respite from the calculated poignancy of these people\u2019s thoughts. Which brings me to the third main problem. Yes, Ratner has some gorgeous things to say about life\u2019s biggest questions, but too often she strays into heavy-handedness. Usually, scenes felt like set-ups for life observations:(Scene where the Old Musician sees something burning)LINE ABOUT THE DESTRUCTIVE NATURE OF HUMANITY(Scene with people playing musical instruments in the forest)LINE WITH A METAPHOR CONNECTING MUSIC, DEATH, AND LIFE(Scene with two lovers in a bed)LINE ABOUT SHARED GRIEF AND THE HEALING POWER OF LOVEUltimately, I felt like I was reading Ratner\u2019s thinly-veiled, deeply existential diary instead of a fully-formed, immersive story. So although I appreciated and admired plenty of things about this book, I can\u2019t fully recommend it as a rewarding reading experience."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer", "userReview": "3 \u00bd-stars, if we could do that here.there are many things this novel does very well, yet i couldn't get past feeling that it was overwritten, to the point i was distracted by the writing a few times, instead of being swept along by the story. (and i'm not even sure that's the right way to describe it? and i am sorry if this sounds like a jerk-ish criticism for a book dealing with such important and difficult subject matter.)but let's focus on the good!! ratner does have a lyrical quality to her writing which paired well with the musicality threading through this story. and it was an interesting approach to writing about cambodia and the horrors caused by the khmer rouge. there are some truly beautiful moments within the inconceivable evil and devastations. while the storytelling is bleak and difficult at moments, there is also hope in music of ghosts. i also really felt the strength of cambodia as a character in this novel - something i really enjoy as a reader, when an author is able to do this well. as with her first novel (which i still have not read, though it sits on my shelf, so i should really make it a priority), ratner brings personal experiences of her survival in cambodia, and her life as a refugee to her second novel. i found her afterword very interesting and a wonderful inclusion with the novel.\n\"If my first novel, In the Shadow of the Banyan, is a story of survival, Music of Ghosts is a story of survivors ... My motivation in writing is to explore the questions of responsibility, atonement, forgiveness, and justice - in the chambers of the heart, and in the intimate encounters where perpetrator and victim sit face-to-face.\"\n bit of an aside: this is the third book i have read in the past couple of weeks that threads music with armed conflicts - and a completely unintentional act on my part. (the other two: The Gustav Sonata and Do Not Say We Have Nothing.) it's heartbreaking and confounding that history continues to repeat itself, and these three novels - dealing with different times and different places - are so relevant and necessary today."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50603889-tammy", "userReview": "Haunting and gorgeous despite the sorrow, loss and longing."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5629372-margaret", "userReview": "This is one melancholy book, as it would have to be.

The novel weaves between their perspectives as both grapple with the past while trying to find hope and meaning in the present. While this is a melancholy novel, it's not a hopeless one. In her afterward, Ratner says that if In the Shadow of the Banyan is a story of survival, than this is a story of surviving.

Still, other than a few problems with pacing (as others, I believe, have mentioned) I found this a beautifully written and detailed visit to the recovering country of Cambodia, a place dearly loved, I would have to say, by its author. The moral complexities that the brutal events of war are also explored in the character of the Old Musician- most effectively, I must say.This is a beautiful book that will teach an American reader a lot about the people, landscape, culture and history of Cambodia.

A book about Cambodia by a Cambodian American author. In retrospect, I probably should have read the author's debut instead, a semi autobiographical tale of her and her mother's survival of the Khmer Rouge regime. It seems closer in line with the sort of story I'd be into. In this book she revisits similar themes, namely the horrors of the aforementioned Khmer Rouge regime, which, of course, was horrific enough to merit any number of stories. I knew about it, but in fairly vague terms...another strikingly botched attempt at communism, holocaust, etc. This book has educated me considerably on the hows and whys, including the US involvement, and the subsequent ramifications and repercussions for modern day Cambodia. Much like with any sort of civil war, the lines between the right and wrong can and did get pretty blurry at times, resulting in a country where victims must live side by side with their tormentors and so on. This is a story of survivors, the protagonist, who fled the country as a refugee, before it became such a dirty hated word, and settled in the US, only to return back to her native land decades later to find out what happened to her father and meet those who stayed behind, trying to make it in a war ravaged country. The author's affection and compassion for her characters is evident in every chapter, every word. It is, after all, a subject so near and dear to her heart. And her writing has a sort of poetic beauty to it, juxtaposed with the horrors and atrocities she describes, it works to a great effect. Can't say I loved the book, though. Liked it, appreciated it, but there was a sort of emotional disconnect owning either to my mood or to the language, which lovely as it was, was also over descriptive and too heavily narrated at times. The alternating timelines, integral as they were for the plot, distracted too with their suddenness. It's a very heavy read as one might expect from a story about Cambodia, so prepare for bleakness, though somehow infused with a sort of optimism and hope and light, which frankly I'm not sure how one finds in a country with such tragic history occurring so recently, but it's there and, if it's reflective of the actual attitudes of the Khmer and not just visitors, more power to them. Overall, this was very enlightening, albeit somewhat plodding read. The author's talent is evident and she conveyed the story with great empathy, finding humanity and kindness in the unlikeliest places, showcasing the striking resilience of spirit. For any student of world history specializing in the particularly ugly sides of it, this is a must. Thanks Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Jenna (Falling Letters)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6676926-jenna-falling-letters", "userReview": "Review originally published 18 April 2017 at Falling Letters. I received a copy from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Vaddey Ratner, a survivor of the Khmer Rouge regime of 1970s Cambodia, has penned an extraordinary tale in Music of the Ghosts. She writes with grace about \u201cquestions of responsibility, atonement, forgiveness, and justice in the more everyday settings in which survivors find themselves\u201d (from the afterword). In exploring such questions, Teera, the Old Musician, and young doctor Narunn reflect on personal identity in the face of immeasurable loss. They have been shaped by survival, when so many of those whom they loved did not survive. Music of the Ghosts is a moving tale of resilience and reconciliation.I have not read Ratner\u2019s first book, In the Shade of the Banyan Tree, but I am certain this book must be a worthy successor. The first aspect of this book that struck me was the vivid prose. Ratner writes with a particular cadence that soothed me from the beginning, despite the subject matter. She does an excellent job at setting a scene. One small scene in particular stood out to me. She described two young monks practicing English at a temple, with a storm approaching. I could hear the sounds she described \u2013 rarely do I find prose that successfully reaches beyond the visual to the auditory for me.The characters are what really gives life to the prose. I found Music of the Ghosts to be a deeply powerful and moving tale. Teera in particular tugged at my heartstrings and brought a few tears to my eyes. She felt like a real woman to me, not a stone cold caricature of a \u2018strong\u2019 one. I adored Narunn, a sincere man trying to do the best with what he has. These characters will draw out your compassion. Teera\u2019s dealing with the complexities of survivor\u2019s guilt moved me. In one scene, she wants to stop her car and give money to numerous beggars on the street, in a location so far from anything she can\u2019t imagine how they\u2019re surviving out there. I felt as Teera did in this moment \u2013 how can I have so much when others have so little?The character\u2019s past connections to the Khmer Rouge (as either perpetrators or victims) demonstrate how good and evil cannot be simplified to black and white. The lines between victim and perpetrator can blur. A person can easily shift from being one to the other. Partway through chapter three, I already found the story to be very intense in this manner. Later on in the book, I had a moment of, \u201cImagine if everyone listened.\u201d What if we listened to voices other than our own? If everyone heard the voices that are too often silenced or ignored? Reading a good story, like this one, can so easily teach empathy to an open mind. Through reading, we can learn about what we didn\u2019t know we didn\u2019t know. This concept, I think, is part of the reason why reading own voices is so important.I have one mild criticism of the book. The story feels a bit dry at times. I wondered when Teera\u2019s story would pick up again. I set the book aside for a few days, not feeling any rush to finish. But the haunting tale pulled me back as I wondered what the Old Musician would reveal to Teera.The Bottom Line: On her website, Ratner notes that Music of the Ghosts address universally significant questions such as, \u201cHow do we account for the crimes we have committed knowingly, and for the suffering we contribute to perhaps without knowing? What does it take to atone? What is possible to forgive?\u201d Music of the Ghosts clear and emotional take on these questions make it a read worth your time."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7606431-alison", "userReview": "This is the authors second book, the first being: In The Shadow of the Banyan, about her own escape from the atrocities of the war in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge Regime. Music of the Ghost is a novel which takes place in Cambodia before, during and after the Khmer Rouge regime, and is about the lives of certain characters, in present day and the aftermath of what happened to them and how they are dealing with their own guilt, sorrow, remembrances and a general longing to have that part of their lives make a bit of sense.Teera, who made it out of Cambodia, with her aunt as a child to the USA, has come back to Cambodia for answers.

But I have the feeling that most Americans couldn't even point out Cambodia on a map, let alone know about the atrocities that were happening there, both internally and by the US, at the same time. Being an absolute sponge when it comes to information, I had heard both of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge regime, and I knew both were quite terrible. This book definitely brings all of those horrors to light, and the devastation felt by the survivors is nearly indescribable. For this reason, I would hope that people would read this book if for no other reason than to educate themselves about this subject.Ratner's writing is absolutely beautiful. Once I really got into the flow of her writing, I felt as though I were carried away by her words. The only problem is, this is a very, very slow-moving book, and it's very, very introspective. I wouldn't mind that so much if there were a little more action to carry it forward. I realize that Ratner is trying to show how Teera has come to Cambodia just to see if she can reconnect with her homeland, and slowly becomes more and more integrated with it while also coming to terms with the horrors that she and her country endured under the Khmer Rouge, but at the same time, Ratner spends a whole lot of time in the heads of both Teera and the Old Musician. I would prefer a bit tighter of a story that didn't meander quite as much through the heads of those two main characters.This is definitely a beautifully written book.

This one is populated with fully fictional characters, but based once again in the horrific reality of the Khmer Rouge regime. While Banyan is a story of one family\u2019s survival of the Cambodian genocide, Music of the Ghosts shows us how the survivors struggle to move forward in the aftermath of war. Suteera was a young girl when she escaped from Cambodia with her aunt \u2013 they crossed the border into Vietnam with the help of a selfless soldier who likely died on his next rescue mission. Teera and her aunt Amara were the only survivors from their family \u2013 her father went missing first, and others died along the journey to the border. Amara and Teera forged a new life in Minnesota, but when Amara receives a diagnosis of rapidly advancing cancer twenty-five years later, she asks her niece to return her ashes to the family\u2019s temple in Phnom Penh. When Teera writes to the Wat Nagara temple to tell them of her aunt\u2019s request, she receives a letter back from a man known as the Old Musician. He claims to have information about the end of her father\u2019s life in one of Pol Pot\u2019s prisons, as well as possession of several of Teera\u2019s father\u2019s traditional Cambodian instruments. The Old Musician carries a vast amount of guilt over his role in the genocide, and he has banished himself to the temple, where he plays ceremonial music to earn his keep. He is anxious to see Teera, yet he dreads her reaction to his story, which also includes his lifelong love for her mother.Twenty-five years after her escape, Teera returns to Cambodia to find a nation in turmoil. Former enemies live side by side as they attempt to reconcile the horrific violence of the past with the desire to mend their country and move forward. Teera meets a young doctor, Narunn, who also lost his entire family during the war \u2013 mistrustful at first, Teera is eventually able to face Narunn with an open heart as they heal from the past and forge a new path forward. Ratner writes about the unbelievable loss and horrors of the war in lyrical prose, beautiful for its stark emotion. The future of Teera and Narunn is continually contrasted with the Old Musician\u2019s flashbacks of his past \u2013 he and Teera\u2019s parents, like many others, initially embraced the Khmer Rouge promise of independent democracy, only to watch in horror as the regime corrupted itself.Compared with Ratner\u2019s first novel, I found the adult perspective in this one to lend itself to a more complex, stronger story. With the analyses of Teera and the Old Musician, I felt like I learned much more history from this novel \u2013 from the French colonization of Cambodia, to the American bombings and the rise of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. Lesser known (at least to me) than the history of Vietnam, Cambodia followed a similar trajectory into war. At the end of the story, the victims of the Khmer Rouge still await the tribunal that will punish those responsible for crimes of war. The Cambodian people, with Teera and Narunn as their fictional representatives, continue to face the ghosts of the past in order to heal and rebuild. The characters sometimes became overly allegorical, as a vessel for Ratner\u2019s message, but they were strong enough that they still felt completely real and necessary in telling this story.I received this book from Touchstone Books in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Joy Clark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2073488-joy-clark", "userReview": "That was an excruciatingly beautiful book.

Wow, it took me less than a paragraph to get on a politic soapbox \u2013 new personal record!!In all seriousness, there are places in this book that remind you the depths of depravity to which humans (and I use that term loosely here) can reach. Violence in books is not normally difficult for me, but I really had a hard time in places here. Try as I might, and even with all my psych training, I cannot understand how humans can sink to such lows. It's like Milgram on steroids with a million other not-so-good social psychology concepts I can't come up with right now. Which is to say - people suck. But not always! The other side of this book explores the determination of humans, the will to live, selflessness, guilt, fortitude, and courage that makes up the better side of our species. The language is beautiful, but almost TOO earnest at times, which is why I didn't give this one 5 stars. I love lyricism, but I'm also of the belief that it can be overdone. Sometimes things should just be stated, not made pretty for the sake of literature. Others have commented on the book's structure and pacing. I think this is basically the same issue. The pacing was much too slow in places because of the lyricism. I also had a few issues with some of the characters' actions.  I won't go into details for the sake of spoilers, but as a mother, Channara's ultimate action confused and angered me. Otherwise, this is an amazing work, and it shouldn't be passed up just because it might get a bit slow in places.Thank you to the publisher for providing me with an ARC through NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10929774-joan", "userReview": "I would rate this between a 4 to 4.5. I received this from NetGalley in exchange for a honest review. A beautifully written but disturbing tale of life and survival during the Khymer Rouge rampage in Cambodia. I absolutely loved Ms. Ratner's first novel, In the Shadow of the Banyan, a novel based on her and her family's harrowing experiences during the Khymer Rouge time. I really liked this one, too,but did find it difficult to get through. It is not a page turner as it involves some very disturbing experiences suffered by so many during those horrible years and the overall debilitating and dehumanizing impact on the Cambodian people. It was harder for me to follow this plot than I did in her first novel but eventually it did come together. In some parts, it did seem a bit contrived as to the entanglements of some of the characters, and how they got together, but notwithstanding, you could feel the dehumanization and painful experiences of many of the characters. Ms. Ratner's writing made you feel right in the midst of all of this. Her prose style, although covering a troubled time to say the least, is like reading a beautifully written poem. Almost lyrical. Ms Ratner does an incredibly realistic job in providing a real life glimpse into the horrible suffering by many, largely the intelligentsia, but also people from all economic levels. What some thought would be an idealistic approach to a revolution turned into their worst nightmare where no one could trust anyone. I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Ratner soon after she wrote her first book when she came to our book group. She is totally mesmerizing, articulate and passionate about her story and her country despite all the suffering she has endured in her life, with family loss and physical impairment just to mention a few. A must read on the historical side but also to be witness to such beautiful writing."}, {"userName": "Booklover, Indianapolis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1098314-booklover-indianapolis", "userReview": "(Dec) I do not usually read a book for the writing - I enjoy books with good plot, enjoyable characters, humor, and dialogue. This book really didn't have any of this, yet I found it a beautifully written book. The writing was lyrical and evocative, and even though there was some really hideous descriptions of torture towards the end, there was a peacefulness about the book that worked for me. Terra is a Cambodian refugee who has lived most of her life in Minnesota. After her beloved aunt (only surviving family member) dies, she contacts the temple in Cambodia where her aunt sent money to let them know. She gets a letter from an old musician who lives at the temple, saying he knew her father and had some instruments that belonged to him. Terra flies to Cambodia to meet him. The book gives background to the old musician, Terra's parents and childhood, and how their pasts were intertwined. I don't know much about the reign of the Kmer Rouge, but learned some in this book (awful, brutal). However, even with the brutality of the prisons described, the book was still a lovely book that is worth reading."}, {"userName": "glenn boyes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8724474-glenn-boyes", "userReview": "I don't know the last time a read a book so slowly, so thoroughly and not wanting it to ever end. This book is amazing!!! I can't say enough about it. As a \"follow-up\" to Vaddey's first novel, \"In the Shadow of the Banyan\" (a story of survival in the Khmer Rouge genocide), \"Music of the Ghosts\" is a story of survivors. It explores the questions of responsibility, atonement, forgiveness and justice in present day situations where the characters find themselves face-to-face encountering the past.

Teera, a 37 year old woman has been living in America for almost 25 years, after escaping from Cambodia as a child refuge. She returns to Cambodia to meet an elderly man known as the Old Musician, who says he knew Teera's father and wants to return some musical instruments that were left for her. Teera returns to a country that has changed dramatically, but there are images and incidents that bring back memories of the past. Similarly, the memories of the Old Musician are presented to the reader, as we are led through the path of event that explains the connection between our two main characters.While the descriptions, thoughts and feelings described in the current time setting are vividly written, there was a feeling of emotional detachment, that makes the reader feel as though they're reading a travelogue, with a little gritty colour thrown in for impact. Vaddey Ratner's writing skills are exhibited when she delves into events of the past. The descriptions of the interaction of people, thoughts and actions that took place in the past are emotionally heart-rending, leaving a lasting impression after reading the chapter, and after reading the novel."}, {"userName": "Geri", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/396107-geri", "userReview": "Although it is slow at times, I loved this book.

The Khmae language, the smells, the sights, the sounds , the tastes, the culture...it all came flooding back and the 7 years that have passed since our return melted away with the words on theses pages.

Now, distraught from the death of the aunt who was the only other relative to escape with her, she decides to return to Cambodia after receiving a letter from an old musician who somehow has the instruments that her father once played.This is a beautiful book, and quite powerful by the end, but in my opinion the author spent too many pages at the top of the novel inside the heads of these two viewpoint characters as they think anguished thoughts but don't explain (or don't yet know) about their history. I was about to put the book down when it kicked into gear and finished strongly.Sadly, the world is becoming full of places like this where two sides in ethnic or revolutionary conflicts now have to live next to each other in the years after the conflict. When the novel gets to the point of telling that story instead of just dwelling on internal anguish, it's extremely powerful. There's a secondary story about the history of a doctor who Teera meets when she returns to Cambodia and her relationship with him that is also excellent, perhaps the best thing in the book.This seems to be shaping up to be a year of great fiction about political conflicts and the collateral damage to people.

Ratner herself is a child of the Khmer, escaping Cambodia, and filled with conflicted memories. She brings this visceral reality to the novel, living between the ghosts of yesteryear and the reality of living in the US. One foot in two worlds...In this particular novel,Suteera,a 37 year old former Cambodian child is living in the US and returns to her country with mixed feelings after she receives a letter from a man known as the \"Old Musician\".

After much agonizing she returns to her homeland while the former ghosts reach out and taunt her as she begins the process of accepting and co existing with the melodies of the past.If some of the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge are difficult for the reader to bear, how difficult it must be for one who has had to bear its reality.Luckily for us, Ratner helps to iron out the wrinkles as Suteera gracefully comes to terms with the riches that remain."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/933360-sarah", "userReview": "Music of the Ghosts is an intense novel about the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in the 1970s. I found it difficult to get through at times, and I had to be in the right mood to read it (in fact, I actually took a break from it to read something much lighter). It focuses on two characters who survived and are confronting their past in the present day (early 2000s), and who have a connection with each other from the past. The chapters alternate between the two characters, and move around between the present-day and flashbacks to the past. Overall there is not that much plot (the old man has some information about the young woman's father that he eventually tells her), and it is much more about the main characters' processing of their grief and guilt at surviving. As long as I wasn't eager for a plot to move along, I enjoyed the lyrical, poetic writing and the insightful view into what it means to be a survivor. I also knew embarrassingly little about the Khmer Rouge and learned a lot in a much more interesting way than a dry history book.
