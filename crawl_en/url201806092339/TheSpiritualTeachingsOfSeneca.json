Seneca was dedicated to Stoicism, and in the essays and letters written for his countrymen (with his own posterity clearly in mind), he explained the Stoic position on many fundamental issues: pleasure and the problem of desire, happiness and contentment, anger, fear, living in the present, how to think for yourself, anxiety and tranquillity, goodness, freedom, trusting the universe, courage, opportunity, cruelty and how to deal with it, friendship, love and trust, death and how to live, learning, chance and fate, time, aspirations, wisdom and more. Lucius Annaeus Seneca (1-65 CE) was an almost exact contemporary of Jesus, and the two shared the same fate of being put to death by Roman authority, in Seneca\u2019s case by his former pupil Nero. Seneca was a complete and successful man of the world. A famous writer, statesman and philosopher who became absurdly wealthy, he parlayed his role as Nero\u2019s tutor into becoming one of the two men who ruled the Empire in Nero\u2019s name. In his lifetime, Seneca enjoyed nearly unlimited power, wealth and fame. His writing style is clear and journalistic, vibrant with Wildean epigrams and surprising metaphors. He was not obscure, nor was he an intellectual snob and his writings themselves are readily accessible. In his writings he expressed the range of valid Stoic ideas but in his actions often contradicted them, making him a fascinating and controversial character. His contemporaries thought there was too great an abyss between his philosophical ideas and his life. He was accused of being a hypocrite - proclaiming Stoic ideas of tyranny and wealth, while he lived the initial Roman dolce vita. He spoke out against tyranny, but was tutor to a tyrant. He said that wealth was of little importance, yet he compiled one of the greatest fortunes in Rome. Seneca achieved literary recognition in his own time as a writer of plays, poetry, essays and natural history, and was rediscovered in the Renaissance, when his epigrammatic and hyperbolic style captivated Italians like Petrarch, Englishmen like Bacon, and Frenchmen like Montaigne. They imitated his style, at times even plagiarised him, and Seneca\u2019s humanist influence on European culture was immense. Famous and powerful in his own time, tutor to the problematic future Emperor Nero, leader of the Roman Senate, one of two men who virtually ran the Roman Empire, Lucius Anneus Seneca (1-65 CE) was much more a man of the world than a hermit of the book. His Stoic philosophy, therefore, was rigorously realistic, worldly and down-to earth. Seneca and his ideas are surprisingly close in spirit to contemporary ideas and behaviour. Because of this many people will identify with his difficulties in practising what he preached. He deeply wanted to be read by posterity, and he would have been pleased that his works lasted for 2000 years. Now we are seeing a resurrection of interest in the man who, as a polymathic writer/philosopher/statesman, was both the most important figure of his age and perhaps history\u2019s most notable example of someone who failed to live up to his own high principles.", "title": "The Spiritual Teachings Of Seneca", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24805120-the-spiritual-teachings-of-seneca", "average": 4.08, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1424359014l/24805120.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/148335.Mark_Forstater", "name": "Mark Forstater"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/690070.Victoria_Radin", "name": "Victoria Radin"}], "type": ["Philosophy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24805120-the-spiritual-teachings-of-seneca", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2038334.The_Spiritual_Teachings_Of_Seneca", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1843935.The_Tao", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2038331.Yoga_Masters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2038336.The_Spiritual_Teachings_Of_The_Tao", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/253837.The_Spiritual_Teachings_of_Marcus_Aurelius", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18428284-the-spiritual-teachings-of-yoga"]}
