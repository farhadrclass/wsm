I really like the way everyone\u2019s stability is being tested. These graphic novels aren\u2019t just a simple zombie beat down, they\u2019re that too, but the real story is with the characters; it\u2019s about how they learn to carry on and cope with their probable deaths at the hands of a pack of hungry zombies. Simply put, those that are weak will not survive. Only those that are willing to let go of the past, and live in the new world, have any chance of continued existence. Family and friends are dying left right and centre; there is no real hope of sanctuary on the horizon: there is only fear, anger and uncertainty. A hardened heart and a will to adapt are the only things that are going to see the characters through. Everyone is behaving in irrational ways; they are becoming violent and quick tempered. The group members are lashing out on each other, as the situation becomes more and more hopeless. They\u2019re also forming odd attachments; one\u2019s that would very unlikely have existed in the previous life. No doubt, in the future, this is only going to get worse. I think the incident at Hershal\u2019s farm was really quite significant to the overall story. It has been established very early how crazy this situation is, and it needed to be done to create the uncertainty that runs through this story; it is impossible to, as clich\u00e9d as it sounds, predict what happens next. Anyone can be killed off in an instant.The insanity is an appropriate response to the situation, and one that makes this an interesting story to explore. Admittedly, this is so much better than I thought it would be. Without this element this series wouldn\u2019t be half as good. This particular volume was a little slow, and a few characters annoyed me with their ridiculous hope when they stumbled upon a temporary haven. These same two characters are very slow to learn, act far too passively and are the embodiment of those that cannot let go of the past. They\u2019re realistic people, but such fools. As a harsh as it sounds, they really needed to go. I wasn\u2019t overly disappointed with the outcome. I think I\u2019m going to really enjoy reading the rest of this. I want to see how far the characters are going to be pushed before they break."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12842423-jessica", "userReview": "4.5 starsReally, really good!

The thing is that I can't stop myself from comparing it to the TV show and it didn't live up to my expectations. There will be spoilers of both the TV show and the comics below.What disappointed me the most during my reading is the relationship between the characters. It felt either botched or false. I couldn't connect to the couples, not to the new ones, nor to those that are actually developed in the TV show. * Andrea / Dale *Those two are actually part of my favorites in the TV show. I liked how Dale helped Andrea coping with Amy's death, how both were struggling to feel better. I picture Dale as my grand-father, a good ear, a support. I loved the friend/family relationship between them. Hence the fact that I can't stand the romantic turn the comic took. It gave me an incest vibe because I couldn't stop picturing them as family, as they're supposed to be in the TV show. Also, Andrea is kind of useless in the comics, total opposite from the show where I loved her. Dale is still insightful and useful but I can't esteem him anymore. * Carol / Tyreese *Once again, there is something wrong about this relationship. Well actually I don't loath Carol in the TV show but I adore Tyreese in both the TV show and the book. Here again I don't understand why it was needed for the author do add romantic interest between those two. They don't seem to click. It was just like \"hey, we're together in the same room, let's have a relationship!\"What I reproach to Carol in the TV show is her way to be always complaining, having an opinion on everything and everyone, to consider herself better than the other and so on, here on the book, she is close to useless (like all the girls in the comics). She is Tyreese's girlfriend and not a person of her own (at least, yet). * Maggie / Glenn *Once again, it felt fake.The scene was literally \"- The world is ending, let's have sex\" *Hershel walks into his daughter and Glenn both naked in bed* \"- But dad you don't understand, we love each other!\" Please no, don't do that to me...I think that if volume 3 disappoint me again, I'll stop my reading there because the prison is my favorite season (and *crossing fingers* Michonne is supposed to come, and I need a badass woman character!)"}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Meredith Holley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1302775-meredith-holley", "userReview": "BANG!

No. I liked it differently than the show. I liked Hershel in the comics more. He was a little more vocal about his opinions than passive. You know, the strong silent type. What I did miss about it though is the epic walker-take-over. The group splits at the end for reasons.

That's a compliment, because The Walking Dead isn't as much about the zombies as it is about how people survive and adapt. The survivors find love and lose people they care for, and nearly lose them. They find safe harbors that aren't really, and wind up back where they began. It's all very realistically done, and I ended up feeling attached to these people, flawed as they may be. But there are zombies after all. And they are frightening, gory, and everything that a good zombie should be. It can be hard to make a zombie scary. They're slow, unarmed, and dumb. The real horror, for me, is the thought of becoming like that, losing your mind entirely and going on and on (even completely frozen) unless somebody delivers a headshot. That is what's really scary to me. I mean, yes, eaten alive isn't exactly my retirement plan, but I think I'd rather that than to entirely lose myself. There is plenty of eating, though, and masses of zombies making surprise appearances. These zombies are very, very quiet. The Walking Dead isn't just about scary zombies, or just about a band of survivors trying to negotiate a post-apocalyptic world. It's both, and it strikes a good balance between the two, and makes for a gripping read."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26154285-brittany", "userReview": "***Horror Buddy Read with the Shallow Readers!

Then they find a prison that looks safe\u2026 probably AAARGH! EVEN MORE ZOMBIES (we\u2019ll find out in Volume 3)!!!!! So yeah, pretty repetitive and predictable stuff - but actually not a terrible comic for all that. The problem remains the lack of characterisation and the unremarkable dialogue \u2013 Robert Kirkman just isn\u2019t much of a writer. He can come up with decent scenarios like putting the survivors into a gated community with some zombies, or the whole situation on the farm with Herschel, but he doesn\u2019t have the ability to make you care about any of the characters. Characters die all the time and the other characters \u2013 usually a loved one like a husband \u2013 is absolutely devastated. But the reader? Completely unfazed. Oh \u2013 was that emotional for you to see that two dimensional cardboard cut-out of a \u201ccharacter\u201d die? Maybe for the other \u201ccharacters\u201d but not for the audience. Oh look some new \u201ccharacters\u201d to fill up the numbers. They\u2019ll probably die soon. Eh. Most of this volume is full of cheesy melodrama. Lori\u2019s preggers \u2013 but Rick\u2019s only just come onto the scene, weeks after she\u2019s been with Shane. Camera close up of boring Rick\u2019s bland pained face - duh duh duuuuuuuh! And everyone\u2019s getting it on. Dale \u2013 the retiree with the camper van? He\u2019s sleeping with Andrea, a young woman roughly a third his age. What?!?! There are younger men around, Andrea \u2013 look at Glenn! Why go for the guy with the most liver spots?! Speaking of Glenn, he pairs up with Maggie, the farm girl. This series should be called \u201cThe Dead and the Restless\u201d or \u201cZombie Dynasty\u201d the way these guys carry on! While I think Kirkman\u2019s writing leaves a lot to be desired, he does manage to reach new heights with Herschel\u2019s farm. Herschel\u2019s been keeping his zombie family in the barn with the hope that a cure from somewhere will somehow bring them back to him. His conversation with Rick about their differing ways of dealing with zombies felt emotional and real. The zombie action is also pretty damn good \u2013 Kirkman manages to take these slow-moving rotting corpses and make them a viable threat to able-bodied people with weapons in some pretty decent set pieces. I think it\u2019s just the sheer numbers that make them so terrifying. Sure you can shoot a bunch, but what happens when you run out of bullets? The art remains unremarkable but serviceable enough for the story. It\u2019s black and white look suits the story which is still gloomy as hell but the relentless misery hasn\u2019t put me off the series yet. So far, The Walking Dead is an ok title but not a masterpiece by a longshot. Neither Kirkman nor Charlie Adlard are doing anything original, either technically or conceptually regarding the genre and the format, but they\u2019re giving us a decent zombie horror story at least. I\u2019m still on board for the series and hope that both creators pick up their game in later volumes."}, {"userName": "Lindsey Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31966250-lindsey-lynn", "userReview": "4/5 Stars!Summary:The next installment in this apocalyptic series.

I thought so too, so after falling head over heels for The Walking Dead on TV, I had very high hopes for the comic books. I picked up Days Gone By, and was really let down. Reading it felt like watching Season One in fast forward. There's a real lack of story or character development. It's just this happened, then this happened, then this happened, as if the panels were rationed for each event. After finishing volume one, I was very happy to stick with the show, but all the references to the comics on Talking Dead roused my curiosity, so I decided to read Miles Behind Us. This book sealed it in my mind: Kirkman is just not that great a writer. The two main overlapping problems are his characters and his dialogue. Everyone in the comic sounds exactly the same. There are no unique voices- pay very close attention to whose mouths the dialogue balloons are coming from, because the words inside them will very rarely tip you off. Also, there is almost no character development whatsoever. You never learn anything about these people, other than what they decide to tell you about themselves- and this leads to some really horrible dialogue, with the characters saying a lot of awkward things that no person would ever say in real life. I know thought balloons are considered old-fashioned and cheesy in modern comics, but Kirkman might want to think about bringing them back- they'll help save his characters from sounding really silly, and save him the effort of finding another way to try and make these people three dimensional.So, while I might get around to reading more of the comics to appease my aforementioned curiosity, I'm definitely in no hurry. If you've only ever watched The Walking Dead TV show, you can definitely skip the comics and not miss much. If you've only read the comics and enjoy them, I can't begin to imagine how much the show will blow your mind."}, {"userName": "Anthony Chavez", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876333-anthony-chavez", "userReview": "While I love the story and the characters this volume's illustrators were different and it was a bit difficult to tell some of the characters apart, at times I confused Dale and Herschel, other times I confused almost all the women.This volume touched on finding a safe home to live and regrow, settle down.

At a point, it feels like overload, sorta like:\"As you know, Bob, Alice was a doctor at Mercy Hospital.\"\"I know, Corey. Remember that time last week where we all got together and forgot our umbrellas? Alice suggested that we danced in the rain - you had a good time, didn't you, Corey?\"\"You know I did, Bob. You always were good at reading people.\"And so on. And so forth.However, I do like how any character is vulnerable to dying, the focus on survival, and what is human and what is not. I'll probably be continuing the graphic novel series - and I definitely want to check out the TV series!"}, {"userName": "Pedro", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39139014-pedro", "userReview": "4.5 \u2b50Bastante mejor que el primer volumen.

For instance: best friends turning on each other and kindly old men wanting to rape younger women. This made me stop for a second, because, as part of my world view I don't believe that people are inherently good but inherently evil. I believe that we are evil because we are so focused on our own selves and not on what God wants. Occasionally we rise above this, but on the whole we fail. We are trapped by greed, by sin, by our own hamartia. In essence we are the walking dead as a whole humanity: preying upon the lives of others. It's because of this, I believe, that I have an affinity with the survivors of this zombie apocalypse. They are not superheroes or warriors but ordinary people doing what they can to survive the rolling horror of a humanity that turns upon itself!"}, {"userName": "Reese Copeland", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1736146-reese-copeland", "userReview": "Well, for starters, I read it in English. Not sure what part of the title is in Spanish. In any case, I really liked this volume. Takes me back to when I first began watching the show. Definitely some differences. But, I realize the show is based of the comic. Some of the characters in the comic are different than they are/were in the show. Not sure which is more interesting, just different and not necessarily in a bad way."}], "description": "An epidemic of apocalyptic proportions has swept the globe, causing the dead to rise and feed on the living. In a matter of months, society has crumbled: There is no government, no grocery stores, no mail delivery, no cable TV. In a world ruled by the dead, we are forced to finally begin living.
