It's a thoughtful, detailed look at the various struggles for freedom that have been undertaken in the history of our nation, both legislatively and historically. Shamir and Faulkner do a solid job of showing both how our founders constructed freedom, but also how that system has and hasn't worked out, throughout the decades, including candid explanations at how our nation has needed to do better when it comes to slavery, and women's right to vote. Though Shamir and Faulkner do a solid job of presenting the book both in a linear and well-rounded format - they walk us through key events/creations of our government, and how it has impacted everything from 1776 to today - the sheer volume of information might be too much for younger picture book readers. But I can absolutely see it appealing to those who are beginning to understand American history for the first time, and would actually recommend it as a nice primer for first and second graders. The art in this volume is just as great as the previous What's the Big Deal... volumes, and I'm looking forward to more from the Shamir/Faulkner team. These books are more important than ever, so highly recommend, full stop."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7036143-lynn", "userReview": "Explains what freedom means in the United States in a manner that can be understood my middle elementary students, and gives ample examples. A great overview of our founding documents and basic history. Some points could be a bit clearer, such as saying, \"It would take eighty years before Chinese immigrants were allowed to become American citizens.\" would have more meaning if we knew when the 80 years began! And the timeline should have included the year all Native Americans were allowed to vote (1957).Full color illustrations in watercolor and pen & ink help explain the concepts, although some have a bit of humor and some are a tad toward caricatures. They are well-dispersed around the text and numerous fact boxes, and the background of white keeps them from being too confusing."}, {"userName": "Noi Nhieu", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21232527-noi-nhieu", "userReview": "Kid-friendly explanation of freedom and history roundup, without convenient disregard of the ugly details about historic people and events."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/938799-crystal", "userReview": "I am getting tired of reading US history books that start with Europe and focus on European American perspectives. This book had maybe two sentences about Native Americans. How do we talk about the history of our country without that context? It would be easy enough to devote at least a paragraph about the loss of freedom some people had. It would also have been easy to talk about the Iroquois Confederacy of Nations contributions to the creation of the constitution. This is something I learned about as an adult. Or, when talking about voting rights, indicating that suffrage didn't happen for all people at the same time. Also, there is a question posed about how slavery is the opposite of freedom so how did it exist here. That is a good question, but one that isn't answered. The author just goes on to explain that the founders owned slaves. It could have been helpful to offer some answers like how people of African descent were not actually considered to be part of the men in the phrase \"all men are created equal.\" I know a book can't have everything, but some of the things missing here are pretty important."}, {"userName": "Alana", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1880120-alana", "userReview": "This is a lot of hedging and, while I understand why, we need more. Good effort from Shamir, but some lines were off-putting."}, {"userName": "Mary Ann", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1610575-mary-ann", "userReview": "This picture book drew me in with a great cover and title, but the approach is very traditional. It starts off with the Revolution, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights--trying to lay a groundwork for the essential question: how does the Bill of Rights give us the freedom to stand up for what we believe?Perhaps this book is trying to do too many things: cover a wide swath of history with many different events, build background knowledge and amuse kids to engage them. It seems to me that \"less is more\" would have been appropriate and helped focus on the key events and message."}], "description": "From the Constitution to civil rights, from women's rights to the four freedoms, this picture book filled with facts and historical trivia shows how America got the nickname \"land of the free.\" It's a free country! Why? Because in America we're free speak our minds, choose our leaders and set the rules. Since way back when Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, Americans have stood up for freedom again and again but it wasn t always easy!  Did you know that Henry Box Brown escaped slavery by shipping himself north in a box? Or that Susan B. Anthony was arrested when she tried to vote? Did you know that even young kids protested for the right to go to school?  This, fact-filled book celebrates how, with every generation, more and more Americans won the right to be free. Find out how they did it and why standing up for the land of the free is such a big deal!", "title": "What's the Big Deal about Freedom", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31521897-what-s-the-big-deal-about-freedom", "average": 3.44, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1482931047l/31521897.jpg", "reviews": 6, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15206534.Ruby_Shamir", "name": "Ruby Shamir"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/311576.Matt_Faulkner", "name": "Matt Faulkner"}], "type": ["History", "Childrens", "Nonfiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31521897-what-s-the-big-deal-about-freedom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30008717-what-s-the-big-deal-about-first-ladies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37511064-what-s-the-big-deal-about-elections", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35572104-to-the-moon"]}
